{"id": "1930290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930290", "title": "Barbarella (film)", "text": "Barbarella (film)\n\nBarbarella is a 1968 science fiction film directed by Roger Vadim based on the comic series of the same name by Jean-Claude Forest. The film stars Jane Fonda as Barbarella, a space-traveler and representative of the United Earth government sent to find scientist Durand Durand, who has created a weapon that could destroy humanity. The cast also includes John Phillip Law, Marcel Marceau, David Hemmings, Ugo Tognazzi, and Milo O'Shea.\n\nAs a director who expressed an interest in comics and science fiction, Vadim was hired to direct \"Barbarella\" after producer Dino De Laurentiis purchased the film rights to the comic series. Vadim attempted to cast several actors in the title role (including Virna Lisi, Brigitte Bardot, and Sophia Loren) before choosing his then-wife, Fonda. A friend of Vadim's, Terry Southern, wrote the initial screenplay, which changed considerably during filming and led to seven other writers credited in the final release, including Vadim and Forest. The film began shooting immediately following the completion of another De Laurentiis comic adaptation, \"\", with both films sharing several cast and crew members.\n\nThe film was particularly popular in the United Kingdom, where it was the year's second-highest-grossing film. Contemporary film critics praised \"Barbarella\" visuals and cinematography, but found its storyline weak after the first few scenes. Although several attempts at sequels, remakes, and other adaptations have been planned, none have entered production.\n\nIn an unspecified future, space adventurer Barbarella is assigned by the President of Earth to retrieve Dr. Durand Durand from the Tau Ceti planetary system. Durand is the inventor of the laser powered super weapon called the positronic ray which Earth leaders fear will fall into the wrong hands. Barbarella crash-lands on Tau Ceti's 16th planet and is knocked unconscious by two children. They bring her into the wreckage of a spaceship where she is bound and attacked by several dolls with razor-sharp teeth. Barbarella is rescued by Mark Hand, the Catchman who patrols the ice looking for errant children. Hand tells her that Durand is in the city of Sogo, and she expresses her appreciation by having sexual intercourse with him, a practice now done on Earth by taking pills. Hand suggests having sex without pills, which Barbarella is initially skeptical of, but she discovers that she enjoys it.\n\nBarbarella leaves the planet and crashes into a labyrinth inhabited by outcasts from Sogo. She is found by Pygar, a blind angel who has lost the will to fly. Pygar introduces her to Professor Ping, who offers to repair Barbarella's ship. Pygar flies her to Sogo after she restores his will to fly with sexual intercourse. When they arrive, Pygar and Barbarella are captured by Sogo's Black Queen and her concierge. The concierge describes the Matmos: living energy in liquid form, powered by evil thoughts and used as an energy source in Sogo. Pygar endures a mock crucifixion and Barbarella is placed in a cage, where hundreds of birds prepare to attack her. She is rescued by Dildano, leader of the local underground, who joins in her pursuit of Durand. Dildano offers her an invisible key to a chamber of dreams where the Queen sleeps, and sends her back to Sogo.\n\nBarbarella is promptly recaptured by the concierge; he places her in an excessive-pleasure machine, which induces fatal sexual pleasure. She outlasts the machine, which shuts down. The concierge, shocked at its destruction, is revealed as Durand (who has aged 30 years due to the Matmos). He wants to become Sogo's new leader and overthrow the Black Queen, which requires his positronic ray and access to the chamber of dreams. Durand takes Barbarella to the chamber, locking her inside with the invisible key. She meets the Queen, who says that if two people are in the chamber, the Matmos will devour them. Durand seizes control of Sogo, as Dildano and his rebels begin their attack on the city. The Black Queen retaliates, releasing the Matmos to destroy Sogo. Protected by what the Black Queen calls Barbarella's innocence, they escape the Matmos and find Pygar; the angel clutches them in his arms and flies off. When Barbarella asks Pygar why he saved a tyrant, he replies: \"An angel has no memory.\"\n\nHaving bought \"Barbarella\" film rights, producer Dino De Laurentiis secured a distribution deal in the United States between France's Marianne Productions and Paramount Pictures. He planned to film \"\", a less-expensive feature, to help cover production costs. In 1966 Roger Vadim expressed an admiration for comics (particularly \"Peanuts\"), saying that he liked \"the wild humor and impossible exaggeration of comic strips\" and wanted to \"do something in that style myself in my next film, \"Barbarella\".\" Vadim saw the film as a chance to \"depict a new futuristic morality ... Barbarella has [no] guilt about her body. I want to make something beautiful out of eroticism.\" His wife, actress Jane Fonda, noted that Vadim was a fan of science fiction; according to the director, \"In science fiction, technology is everything ... The characters are so boring—they have no psychology. I want to do this film as though I had arrived on a strange planet with my camera directly on my shoulder—as though I was a reporter doing a newsreel.\"\n\nAfter Terry Southern finished writing Peter Sellers' dialogue for \"Casino Royale\", he flew to Paris to meet Vadim and Fonda. Southern, who had known Vadim in Paris during the early 1950s, saw writing a science-fiction comedy based on a comic book as a new challenge. He enjoyed writing the script, particularly the opening striptease and the scenes with tiny robotic toys pursuing Barbarella to bite her. Southern enjoyed working with Vadim and Fonda, but he felt that De Laurentiis was intent only on making a cheap film that was not necessarily good. Southern said later, \"Vadim wasn't particularly interested in the script, but he was a lot of fun, with a discerning eye for the erotic, grotesque, and the absurd. And Jane Fonda was super in all regards.\" Southern was surprised to see his screenplay credited to Vadim and several Italian screenwriters in addition to himself. Credited screenwriters included Claude Brulé, Vittorio Bonicelli, Clement Biddle Wood, Brian Degas, Tudor Gates, and Barbarella creator Jean-Claude Forest; Degas and Gates were hired by De Lautentiis after he was impressed with their work on \"Danger: Diabolik\". Charles B. Griffith later said that he had done uncredited work on the script; the production team \"hired fourteen other writers\" after Southern \"before they got to me. I didn't get credit because I was the last one.\" According to Griffith, he \"rewrote about a quarter of the film that was shot, then re-shot, and I added the concept that there had been thousands of years since violence existed, so that Barbarella was very clumsy all through the picture. She shoots herself in the foot and everything. It was pretty ludicrous. The stuff with Claude Dauphin and the suicide room were also part of my contribution to the film.\"\n\nSeveral actresses were approached before Jane Fonda was cast as Barbarella. De Laurentiis' first choice was Virna Lisi; his second was Brigitte Bardot, who was not interested in a sexualized role. His third choice was Sophia Loren, who was pregnant and felt that she would not fit the role. Fonda was uncertain about the film, but Vadim convinced her by saying that science fiction was a rapidly-evolving genre. Before filming \"Barbarella\", she was the subject of two sex scandals: the first when her nude body was displayed across an eight-story billboard promoting the premiere of \"Circle of Love\" in 1965, and the second when several candid nude photos from Vadim's closed set for \"The Game Is Over\" were sold to \"Playboy\" the following year. According to biographer Thomas Kiernan, the billboard incident made her a sex symbol in the United States. Vadim said he did not want the actress to play Barbarella \"tongue in cheek\", and he saw the character as \"just a lovely, average girl with a terrific space record and a lovely body. I am not going to intellectualise her. Although there is going to be a bit of satire about our morals and our ethics, the picture is going to be more of a spectacle than a cerebral exercise for a few way-out intellectuals.\" Fonda felt her first priority for Barbarella was to \"keep her innocent\"; the character \"is not a vamp and her sexuality is not measured by the rules of our society. She is not being promiscuous, but she follows the natural reaction of another type of upbringing. She is not a so-called 'sexually liberated woman' either. That would mean rebellion against something. She is different. She was born free.\"\n\nFonda personally recommended John Phillip Law as Pygar to Vadim following their work on \"Hurry Sundown\". Law, an avid comic book reader since childhood, read the Forest comics and studied the DC Comics character Hawkman for inspiration. The delayed pre-production of \"Barbarella\" allowed Law to film two roles before committing to the film: as Bill Meceita in the Spaghetti Western \"Death Rides a Horse\", and as the title character in \"Danger: Diabolik\".\n\nFrench mime Marcel Marceau had his first speaking role in the film as Professor Ping. Comparing his character to Bip the Clown and Harpo Marx, he said that he did not \"forget the lines, but I have trouble organising them. It's a different way of making what's inside come out. It goes from the brain to the vocal chords, and not directly to the body.\"\n\nAll costumes in the film, including Fonda's, were designed by French costume designer Jacques Fonteray and manufactured by Sartoria Farani, with Barbarella's costume in the final scenes being, as the credits put it, \"inspired by ideas of\" fashion designer Paco Rabanne. Barbarella's outfits were Fonteray's interpretation of Forest's vision, combining Orientalist and medieval aesthetics with samurai armors. Forest also worked on the production's design. In a 1985 interview, he said that during production he did not care about his original comic strip and was more interested in the film industry: \"The Italian artists were incredible; they could build anything in an extremely short time. I saw all the daily rushes, an incredible amount of film. The choices that were made for the final cut from those images were not the ones I would have liked, but I was not the director. It wasn't my affair.\"\n\nAccording to Law, \"Barbarella\" began shooting after production on \"Danger: Diabolik\" ended on 18 June 1967; sets such as Valmont's night club in \"Danger: Diabolik\" were used in both films. \"Barbarella\" was shot at Cinecittà in Rome. To film its striptease introduction, Fonda said that the set was turned upward to face the ceiling of the soundstage. A pane of thick glass was laid across the opening of the set, with the camera hung from the rafters above it. Fonda then climbed onto the glass to perform the scene. Other scenes involved hanging Fonda upside down in an enormous vat of oil and dry ice, and her stomach being skinned when being shot through a plastic tube. For the scenes involving the Excessive Pleasure Machine, Fonda and Milo O'Shea were not told of explosions that would happen on set since the prop was rigged with flares and smoke bombs. Fonda explained that \"Vadim wanted us to look natural, so he didn't tell us what a big explosion there would be. When the machine blew up, flames and smoke were everywhere, and sparks were running up and down the wires. I was frightened to death, and poor Milo was convinced something had really gone wrong and I was being electrocuted.\"\n\nFor the scene involving Barbarella being attacked by hummingbirds, finches and budgerigars were used as it was illegal to ship hummingbirds overseas. The birds were not behaving as Vadim had expected, which led to him employing a large fan to blow them at Fonda, who had birdseed in her costume. Film critic Roger Ebert, after visiting the set, wrote that the fan led to birds \"losing control over natural body functions, so it was all a little messy\". Ebert concluded that \"After two weeks of this, [Fonda] got a fever and was hospitalized. I can't reveal here how they finally did the scene\".\n\nThe actress later described her discomfort on the film's set. In her autobiography, Fonda said that Vadim began drinking during lunch; his words slurred, and \"his decisions about how to shoot scenes often seemed ill-considered\". Fonda was bulimic and, at the time, was \"a young woman who hated her body...playing a scantily clad, sometimes-naked sexual heroine\". Photographer David Hurn echoed Fonda, noting that she was insecure about her appearance during the production's photo shoots. The actress took sick days so the film's insurance policy would cover the cost of a shutdown while the script was edited. Vadim would later state in his memoir that Fonda \"didn't enjoy shooting \"Barbarella\"\", specifically that she \"disliked the central character for her lack of principle, her shameless exploitation of her sexuality and her irrelevance to contemporary social and political realities.\"\n\nMichel Magne was commissioned to score \"Barbarella\", whose effort was discarded. The film's soundtrack, completed by composer-producers Bob Crewe and Charles Fox, has been described as lounge or exotica. Crewe was known for composing 1960s songs such as the Four Seasons' \"Big Girls Don't Cry\". Some of the music is credited to the Bob Crewe Generation, a group of session musicians who contributed to the soundtrack. Crewe invited the New York-based group the Glitterhouse, whom he knew through his production work, to provide vocals for the songs. He reflected on the soundtrack in his autobiography, saying that it \"clearly needed to have a fun and futuristic approach to it, with sixties-music sensibility\".\n\n\"Barbarella\" opened in New York on 11 October 1968 and earned $2.5 million in North American theaters that year. It was the second-most-popular film in general release in the United Kingdom in 1968, after \"The Jungle Book\". The film was shown in Paris that month, and was released in Italy on 18 October. It was released on 25 October throughout France, where it was distributed by Paramount. The film was re-released theatrically in 1977, without its nude scenes, as Barbarella: Queen of the Galaxy. \"Barbarella\" received a \"condemned\" rating from the National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures, which called the film a \"sick, heavy-handed fantasy with nudity and graphic representations of sadism\" and criticized the Production Code Administration for approving it.\n\nIn 1994, the film's laserdisc presented it in widescreen for the first time on home video. It was released on DVD on 22 June 1999, and on Blu-ray in July 2012, with the 1968 theatrical trailer the disc's only bonus feature. According to Charles Taylor of \"The New York Times\", home-video releases of the film before the Blu-ray version were \"murky\". Chris Nashawaty (\"Entertainment Weekly\") and Sean Axmaker (\"Video Librarian\") called \"Barbarella\" Blu-ray transfer \"breathtaking\" and \"superb-looking\", respectively.\n\nSome contemporary publications reported that the film's first scenes were enjoyable, but its quality declined thereafter. According to Wendy Michener's review in \"The Globe and Mail\", after the striptease scene \"we are plunged back into the mundane, not to say inane world, of the spy thriller with a dreary overlay of futuristic science-fiction\" and it \"just lies there, with all its psychedelic plastic settings\". \"Barbarella\" script and humor were criticized; A reviewer in \"Variety\" noted a \"flat script\" with only \"a few silly-funny lines of dialog\" for a \"cast that is not particularly adept at comedy\". Dan Bates wrote in \"Film Quarterly\" that \"sharp satiric moments ... are welcome and refreshing but are rather infrequent\", and Renata Adler of \"The New York Times\" noted that \"there is the assumption that just mentioning a thing (sex, politics, religion) makes it funny\".\n\nCritics praised the film's design and cinematography. \"Variety\" mainly negative review noted \"a certain amount of production dash and polish\" and, according to Derek Malcolm of \"The Guardian\", \"Claude Renoir's limpid colour photography and August Lohman's eye-catching special effects are what save the movie time and again\". A \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" reviewer wrote that \"Barbarella\" decor is \"remarkably faithful to Jean-Claude Forest's originals\", noting a \"major contribution of Claude Renoir as director of photography\" and \"Jacques Fonterary's and Paco Rabanne's fantastic costumes\". James Price (\"Sight & Sound\") agreed, citing \"the inventiveness of the decors and the richness of Claude Renoir's photography\".\n\nMalcolm and Lohman criticized \"Barbarella\" nature, themes and tone, with Malcolm calling it a \"nasty kind of film\", \"modish to the core\" and \"essentially just a shrewd piece of exploitation\". Lohman suggested the film's humor was \"not jokes, but hard-breathing, sadistic thrashings, mainly at the expense of Barbarella, and of women.\" Bates called it \"pure sub-adolescent junk\" and \"bereft of redeeming social or artistic importance\".\n\nMichener praised \"Barbarella\" as part of \"the first female sci-fi\". Its shaggy gold rugs, impressionist paintings and spaceship were \"unquestionably female in design compared with any of today's projectiles\"; Barbarella is \"no man-challenging superwoman, but a sweet soft creature who's always willing to please a man who's king to her\". According to Price, \"There is a real fascination in its basic idea, which is a happy belief in the survival of sexuality... The idea fascinates, but the execution somehow disappoints (how often one has to say that about Vadim).\" Bates' review concluded, \"In the year that Stanley Kubrick and Franklin Schaffner finally elevated the science-fiction movie beyond the abyss of the kiddie show, Roger Vadim has knocked it right back down.\"\n\nNumerous retrospective reviews have discussed \"Barbarella\" plot and design. According to \"The A.V. Club\"s Keith Phipps, \"Mario Garbuglia keeps throwing inventive visuals and remarkable sets at the heroine\" but \"the journey itself is an unrelenting trudge\". Sean Axmaker of \"Video Librarian\" called the film's \"set design and wild color triumphing over story and character\". Taylor noted a lack of \"plot impetus\", suggesting that Vadim may have been \"preoccupied with the special effects, though they are [and were] rather cheesy\". Kim Newman (\"Empire\") gave \"Barbarella\" three stars out of five, calling the film \"literally episodic\" and writing that the episodes spend \"more time on the art direction, the costuming and the psychedelic music track than the plot\".\n\nAbout its sexual elements, Brian J. Dillard wrote that the film's gender roles were not \"particularly progressive, especially given the running gag about Barbarella getting her first few tastes of physical copulation after a lifetime of 'advanced' virtual sex\" in his review on AllMovie. Phipps found the film \"a missed opportunity\", noting that the source material was part of \"an emerging wave of European comics for adults\" which \"Vadim film[ed] indifferently.\" David Kehr of the \"Chicago Reader\" found the film \"ugly\" on several levels, particularly its \"human values\". Newman summarized the film as \"cheerful, kitsch and camp\", with \"a succession of truly amazing fashion creations with all the confidence of a generation that thought sex was, above all, fun\". Newman compared the film to \"\" and \"Star Wars\", writing that \"Barbarella\" makes them seem \"stuffy\" by comparison. Charles Webb's review for MTV noted that \"Barbarella\" suffers when described as a \"camp classic\", since there was \"so much to like about Fonda's work here and the movie as a whole\"; \"Fonda brings naivete and sweetness to a part that requires a certain level of comfort going bare onscreen, while the hostile planet Lythion is a parade of inventive and odd ways to imperil our heroine.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Barbarella\" may seem \"quaint\" to modern audiences but its \"imagery has echoed for years in pop culture.\" Lisa Eisner of \"The New York Times\" called Barbarella \"the most iconic sex goddess of the '60s.\" The film's costumes influenced Jean-Paul Gaultier's designs in \"The Fifth Element\", and Gaultier noted Paco Rabanne's metallic dress that was worn by Fonda.\n\n\"Barbarella\" was later called a cult film. Author Jerry Lembcke noted the film's popularity; it was available in small video stores, and was familiar beyond the film buff community. According to Lembcke, any \"doubt about its cult status was dispelled when \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked it number 40 on its list of top 50 cult movies\" in 2003. He cited the film's popularity on the internet, with fansites ranging from a Barbarella festival in Sweden to memorabilia sales and reviews. Lembcke writes that the websites focus on the character of Barbarella.\n\n\"Barbarella\" has influenced popular music, with Duran Duran taking its name from the film's antagonist. The group later released a concert film, \"Arena (An Absurd Notion)\", with Milo O'Shea reprising his role from \"Barbarella\".\n\nMathmos a British company famously known as the original creators of the lava lamp, invented by its founder Edward Craven Walker. The company was originally known as Crestworth changed its name to “Mathmos” in 1992. The name change signaled the company’s new direction it was headed in and was directly inspired by the lake of Matmos in the film and comics. \n\nMusic videos influenced by \"Barbarella\" include \"Break Free\" by Ariana Grande.\n\nA sequel to \"Barbarella\" was planned in November 1968. Producer Robert Evans said that its working title would be \"Barbarella Goes Down\", with the character having undersea adventures. Terry Southern said that he was contacted by de Laurentiis in 1990 to write a sequel \"on the cheap...but with plenty of action and plenty of sex,\" and possibly starring Fonda's daughter.\n\nA new version of \"Barbarella\" was proposed in the 2000s, and director Robert Rodriguez was interested in developing a version after the release of \"Sin City\". Universal Pictures planned to produce the film, with Rose McGowan playing Barbarella. Dino and Martha De Laurentiis signed on with writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who had worked on \"Casino Royale\". When the film's budget exceeded $80 million, Universal withdrew. According to Rodriguez, he did not want his film to look like Vadim's. He searched for alternate financing when Universal did not meet his budget, and found a studio in Germany which would provide a $70 million budget. Rodriguez eventually left the project, since using that studio would require a long separation from his family. Joe Gazzam was then approached to write a screenplay, with Robert Luketic directing and Dino and Martha De Laurentiis still credited as producers.\n\nGaumont International Television announced a pilot for a TV series based on the film by Amazon Studios in 2012. The pilot would be written by Purvis and Wade and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, and the series would be set in Asia. Refn spoke about the show in 2016 where he discussed about having a greater interest on developing \"The Neon Demon\" than \"Barbarella\", concluding that \"certain things are better left untouched. You don't need to remake everything.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Stone tools have been dated using scientific dating such as Carbon 14 dating and Potassium argon dating. Stone tools have been found to be almost 2 million years old. Chopping tools have been found to be about 2 million years old as well. The oldest object in the British Museum is a Chopping Tool. It was found in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. Since Chopping tools are a sub category of stone tools we can see how these tools have developed over time.\n\nLooking at how these tools are made is an important part in the history of the Chopping Tool. A large, hard stone was needed as well as a softer stone that would be made into the chopper. The soft stone was commonly basalt (volcanic rock). The large hard stone acted as a hammer as it was hit against the soft stone. The soft stone would begin to chip away. The maker of the chopping tool would use the hard stone to create the edges and point needed to make the chopping tool efficient. Double sided sharp edges and a point are a common form of the chopping tool. The look is Similar to a Native American Projectile point, except that a chopping tool was used for stationary objects.\n\nThe use of the chopping tool varied from place to place just like any other archaeological artifact. Depending on what the maker of the chopping tool made or ate depended on what the chopping tool was used for. Most commonly the chopping tool was used for food purposes. They could be used for cutting down tree branches to get to fruits or to cut large plants that could be used for food. Anything that requires a knife today could have been replaced with a chopping tool. They were also used to help assist the maker in cutting the meat of the animals. Just like butchers today, skinning and cleaning of all the meat that we eat is needed. The chopping tool helped assist hunters gather the meat, especially from large animals that were hard to carry back to the location they were staying at, and make it edible for them to consume. Another use for the chopping tool was to smash bones. Bone marrow is a good source of nutrients to help your body function. For hunters and gatherers this was important since the next source of food could have been days to weeks away. When they would hunt animals they would use the sharp edge to cut the meat off the bones and then the back edge was hard enough to smash and crush bones. Once the bones were crushed the marrow could be collected.\n\nThe flakes that were chipped off the soft rock did not go to waste. Many of the thick sharp pieces were used as small knives to do very light cutting tasks. The flakes were a very important part of everyday life just like the chopping tool. Both pieces were used in everyday life to help with survival.\n\nThe idea of the chopping tool spread from people to people throughout the land. In Asia stone tools did not develop as much as other places in the world. To make these tools like the chopping tool you have to have specific types of rock such as flint and jasper. In Asia these rocks were hard to find but the amount of the coarse-grained rocks and material was much easier to find. Even though the materials they used such as volcanic material and petrified wood wasn't as strong or as easy to shape they still were able to make tools that resembled the chopping tool and they were used in very similar ways. Many of the tools that were found in Asia, they were found in the Choukoutienian caves. The Choukoutienian industry is where many of the stone tools in Asia started. The caves are filled with many artifacts and the early chopping tool is one of the many artifacts found.\n\nThe resources used to make many variations of the chopping tool were present in much of the world. Even if the items that were used to make the chopping tool in various parts of the world were not as durable or as powerful or sharp they still were used for cutting items as well as day to day survival.\n"}

The company was founded in 1967 by Beverly S. Griffin and Robert R. Griffin.\n\nThe company maintained dossiers on card counters, serial jackpot winners, and other individuals, chiefly professional gamblers using legal techniques to gain an advantage in casino games; these profiles were regularly published in the \"Griffin Book\" and distributed to subscribing casinos. Griffin Investigations was instrumental in ending the MIT Blackjack Team’s winning streak, after a Griffin investigator purchased the names, photographs, and other details identifying the group's members, and the company distributed the information to casinos. \n\nGriffin also marketed a controversial facial recognition system that used computer software to compare gamblers' faces against several volumes of mug shots. Beverly S. Griffin, the firm's co-founder and co-owner, estimates as many as half of Southern Nevada's casinos now use biometric technology to identify the faces of card cheats or other undesirables. However, a Las Vegas casino surveillance director (writing under the pseudonym Cellini) reported in the book, \"The Card Counter's Guide to Casino Surveillance\" (2003), that biometric technology was considered virtually useless by actual casino surveillance operatives because of overwhelming numbers of false reads.\n\nThe \"Las Vegas Sun\" reported on September 13, 2005 that Griffin Investigations had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in light of legal costs and damages from a successful defamation lawsuit against the company. The lawsuit had been brought by two gamblers, Michael Russo and James Grosjean, claiming they had been improperly detained, labeled as cheaters, and arrested, on the basis of information supplied by Griffin. The judgement of a jury in Clark County District Court, in June 2005, ordered Griffin Investigations to pay $15,000 to Michael Russo and $10,000 to James Grosjean in punitive damages; and Griffin Investigations and Caesars Palace were each ordered to pay Russo and Grosjean actual damages of $25,000 each.\n\nAccording to the minutes of the Private Investigators Licensing Board for 18 June 2008, Beverly Griffin said that her ex-husband had retired, and she was seeking to purchase his half of the business. She said all Chapter 11 payments were up to date, all requirements had been met, and she had, as advised by counsel, changed the way information was supplied, using data encryption.\n\n\n"}

The central character is Roberto della Griva, an Italian nobleman stranded on a deserted ship in the Pacific Ocean, and his slowly decaying mental state, in a backdrop of Baroque-era science, metaphysics, and cosmology.\n\nRoberto della Griva, a 17th-century Italian nobleman, is the sole survivor of a shipwreck during a fierce storm. He finds himself washed up on an abandoned ship in a harbour through which, he convinces himself, runs the International Date Line (roughly 180° longitude). Although the shore is very close, Roberto is unable to swim, and is therefore stranded on the ship. He begins to reminisce about his life and his love. He becomes obsessed about his allegedly evil twin brother, who is split from his own persona through a process reminiscent of the doppelgänger effect, and thus accusing him of all the bad things that happened in his life. The brother takes blame mainly for his bad choices and is present to sweeten the disappointments of life. Through this reminiscence he becomes convinced that all his troubles will end, if only he can reach the land. The story is told from the point of view of a modern editor who has sorted through the man's papers. Exactly how the papers were preserved and eventually handed down to the editor remains a point of conjecture.\n\nThis work contains references to Eco's previous novels.

The town was later taken by the Romans during the conquest of Lusitania and named Augustobriga.\n\nIn the 12th century, the site was repopulated by King Ferdinand II of León, walling it and re-establishing the old Visigothic diocese of Calabria into the new bishopric as suffragan of the Diocese of Santiago de Compostela; it comprised a big part of the province of Salamanca, and a portion of the province of Cáceres, an act confirmed by Pope Alexander III in 1175. This led to the construction of the city's cathedral, an architectural hybrid of the Gothic and late Romanesque styles. King Alfonso VIII gave the city of Caliabria to the Diocese of Ciudad Rodrigo in 1191. The first bishop of whom anything certain is known was called Pedro (1165) and one of the most celebrated was the learned jurist Don Diego de Covarruvias y Leyva (1560).\n\nDuring the 15th century, a series of artworks of perhaps 35-panels (only 26 panels survive), known as the \"Retablo (altarpiece) of the Cathedral of the Ciudad\" Rodrigo was created by Fernando Gallego, Maestro Bartolomé, and the artists of their workshops. Over the centuries, the works became badly deteriorated. In 1954, they were acquired by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation which had them fully restored. In 1961, the foundation donated the works to the University of Arizona Museum of Art in Tucson, Arizona, where they reside today.\n\n\"Main articles: Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo (1810) and Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo (1812)\"\n\nIts position as a fortified town on the main road from Portugal to Salamanca made it militarily important in the middle years of the Napoleonic Peninsular War.\n\nThe French Marshal Michel Ney took Ciudad Rodrigo on July 9, 1810 after a 24-day siege. The 5,500-man Spanish garrison of Field Marshal Don Andreas de Herrasti put up a gallant defense, surrendering only after French artillery opened a breach in the walls and their infantry were poised for an assault. The Spanish suffered 461 killed and 994 wounded, while 4,000 men and 118 cannon were captured. Ney's VI Corps lost 180 killed and over 1,000 wounded during the siege. The French soldiery then pillaged the city. The siege delayed Marshal André Masséna's invasion of Portugal by a month.\n\nThe British General Wellington began his 1812 campaign by taking Ciudad Rodrigo by storm on the night of January 19, 1812 – January 20, 1812 after preparatory operations lasting about 10 days. In these clashes, the British captured the Greater Teson on January 8 and the Lesser Teson on January 16. Meanwhile, two breaches in the walls had been opened by Wellington's twenty-three 24-lb and four 18-lb siege guns under the command of Captain Alexander Dickson. Major-General Thomas Picton's 3rd Division assaulted the \"greater\" breach while Robert Craufurd's Light Division attacked the \"lesser\" breach. Allied losses in the siege were 195 killed and 916 wounded, although amongst the dead were Maj-Gens Henry Mackinnon and Craufurd. The 2,000-man French garrison under Brig-Gen Barrié lost 529 killed and wounded, while the rest were captured. The French Army of Portugal lost its entire siege train among the 142 captured cannon. There were two cannons embedded in the wall of the \"greater\" breach that caused most casualties in the storming. The 88th \"Connaught Rangers\" Regiment took one of the guns while the 45th \"Nottinghamshire\" Regiment took the other. The victory was marred when the British rank and file thoroughly sacked the city, despite the efforts of their officers. The capture of Ciudad Rodrigo allowed Wellington to proceed to Badajoz, whose taking was a much more bloody affair.\n\nIn 1812, the then-Viscount Wellington (later created a Duke) was rewarded for his victorious liberation of Spain with the hereditary Spanish ducal victory title of Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo.\n\nCiudad Rodrigo is also the birthplace of Siglo de Oro writer Feliciano de Silva.\n\nThe historic centre of Ciudad Rodrigo is enclosed by the city walls.\n\nThis castle was built by the medieval King Enrique II of Castile in 1372.\n\nCiudad Rodrigo is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

It is now the main route between Bingley & the nearby villages of Harden, Wilsden & Cullingworth (the B6429).\n\nA bridge has existed at this point over the river since mediaeval times. The current bridge dates from 1686 and replaced an earlier timber structure. During renovations in 2010, engineers found unique stonemason marks carved into sections of the bridge that were previously inaccessible until the scaffolding went up around it. The bridge was widened and a parapet added in 1775. Previous to the bridge being built, visitors to the town would ford the river at a crossing just south of the bridge that would lead them to the bottom of what is now Ferrand Street. When the water is low enough, the stones of this crossing are said to be visible.\n\nThe All Saints Parish Church and the Old White Horse Inn, a Coaching inn were constructed very close to the eastern bank and Bingley's modern town centre spread south from these beginnings. A mill extended on the east bank for which a weir was built across the Aire. The water was then funnelled under the mill to power the works which started out as a Corn Mill, a forge and for much of the 20th century was a fat refinery. The mill was demolished in 1984 and the site has now been replaced by housing.\n\nIn the 18th century, the middle of the bridge was an area where locals would congregate and 'gossip'. This would also entail talking to travellers who were using the bridge to get from Halifax and beyond to Otley and Ilkley.\n\nThe bridge was originally named Bingley Bridge, but an influx of Irish immigrants caused a name change. They came to work in the Bingley mills and they also visited the Brown Cow Inn, which meant going across the bridge. The Brown Cow acquired the nickname of 'The Irish Inn'; this also led to the bridge being similarly named. Harry Speight in his book \"The Chronicles of Old Bingley\" suggests the name came about due to the crossing of the Aire being like going over the water to Ireland.\n\nDespite previous strengthening works, the bridge was deemed unfit for two-way traffic, and traffic lights were installed for a time at either end. These allowed only a single lane across for some time - disrupting local traffic at peak times.\n\nIn January 2010, Bradford Council closed the bridge completely, and commenced works to strengthen the bridge. These works resulted in the closure of Harden Road to vehicles over the bridge. The works were originally due to take place in June 2009, but were postponed owing to the presence of rare Daubenton's bats roosting in the spans of the bridge. After a £1.6 million pound project, Ireland Bridge reopened to two-way traffic in June 2010.\n\n"}

This epidemic, often referred to as the Great Plague of Milan, claimed possibly one million lives, or about 25% of the population. This episode is considered one of the later outbreaks of the centuries-long pandemic of bubonic plague which began with the Black Death. The plague may have contributed to the economic decline of Italy relative to other Western European countries.\n\nGerman and French troops carried the plague to the city of Mantua in 1629, as a result of troop movements associated with the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). Venetian troops, infected with the disease, retreated into northern and central Italy, spreading the infection. \n\nIn October 1629, the plague reached Milan, Lombardy's major commercial center. Although the city initiated effective public health measures, including quarantine and limiting the access of German soldiers and trade goods, the plague smoldered. A major outbreak in March 1630 was due to relaxed health measures during the carnival season. This was followed by a second wave in the spring and summer of 1631. Overall, Milan suffered approximately 60,000 fatalities out of a total population of 130,000.\n\nEast of Lombardy, the Republic of Venice was infected in 1630–31. The city of Venice was severely hit, with recorded casualties of 46,000 people out of a population of 140,000. Some historians believe the drastic loss of life, and its impact on commerce, ultimately resulted in the downfall of Venice as a major commercial and political power. The papal city of Bologna lost an estimated 15,000 citizens to the plague, with neighboring smaller cities of Modena and Parma also being heavily affected. This outbreak of plague also spread north into Tyrol, an alpine region of western Austria and northern Italy.\n\nLater, outbreaks of bubonic plague in Italy include the city of Florence in 1630–1633 and the areas surrounding Naples, Rome and Genoa in 1656–57.\n\nPopulation before the plague and death toll, selected cities:\nA 2019 study found that the plague of 1629–1631 led to lower growth in several cities affected by the plague and \"caused long‐lasting damage to the size of Italian urban populations and to urbanization rates. These findings support the hypothesis that seventeenth‐century plagues played a fundamental role in triggering the process of relative decline of the Italian economies.\"\n\nThe 1630 plague in Milan is the backdrop for several chapters of Alessandro Manzoni's 1840 novel \"The Betrothed\" (). Although a work of fiction, Manzoni's description of the conditions and events in plague-ravaged Milan are completely historical and extensively documented from primary sources researched by the author.\n\nAn expunged section of the book, describing the historical trial and execution of three alleged \"plague-spreaders\", was later published in a pamphlet entitled \"Storia della colonna infame\" (History of the pillar of infamy).\n\n\n"}

The name Froggatt Edge applies only to the northernmost section of the escarpment; the middle and southernmost sections are called Curbar Edge and Baslow Edge respectively. The escarpment, like many in this area, is easily accessible from Sheffield.\n\nThe escarpment forms the eastern rim of the valley of the River Derwent in this part of its course and, when viewed from the valley below, can be seen as rocky crags against the skyline. At the top of the escarpment is a managed heather moor, which is purple with bloom in late summer. Part of the moor management involves periodically burning sections to discourage reforestation and promote fresh heather shoots. Below the escarpment, on the valley slopes heading down towards the Derwent, is a forest of birch trees. The escarpment offers views across both moorland and valley. On the paths that run along both the top and bottom of the escarpment, the underlying gritstone is often exposed and subsequently worn by the passage of many feet, creating a warm-coloured sand that is characteristic of this part of the Peak District. \n\nAs with many of the gritstone edges in the Peak District, Froggatt was used as a source of millstones; a number of half-completed millstones can still be found at the bottom of this and other edges in Derbyshire.\n\nFroggatt Edge is frequented by rock climbers and hillwalkers throughout the year. \n\nJoe Brown popularised two well-known classic routes in the late 1940s, Sunset Slab (HVS 4b) and Three Pebble Slab (HVS 5a). Whilst the climbing is not difficult, a fall from either climb (particularly Sunset Slab) would result in injuries. One of the best-known climbs at Froggatt Edge is \"Downhill Racer\", a smooth and near-vertical 17 m (50 ft) slab of gritstone. It was first climbed in 1977 by Pete Livesey and represented a breakthrough in that it combined difficulty with real danger: there is no suitable crack in the rock in which to place protection (to anchor a rope), so a climber who slips from the small finger holds will hit the ground. It is now graded E4 6a.\n"}

Atum was said to have masturbated, or copulated with himself, to produce the deities Shu and Tefnut, thus beginning the process of creation. The hand he used in this act was personified as a goddess, the Hand of Atum, who was equated with Hathor or two other, more minor goddesses, Nebethetepet and Iusaaset. The earliest texts to mention them seem to treat Iusaaset and Nebethetepet as two names for a single goddess, but after the time of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000–1700 BC) they were treated as separate, although similar, deities. The name \"Iusaaset\" means something like \"She who grows as she comes\", and \"Nebethetepet\" means \"Lady of the Field of Offerings', so the Egyptologist Stephen Quirke suggests that they represented two aspects of creation: Iusaaset for growth and Nebethetepet for abundance.\n\nLike Atum, Iusaaset was worshipped in the city of Heliopolis.

It reached number one in at least 18 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it earned triple-platinum certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and became the country's best-selling song of 1999. The song is one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over 10 million copies sold. An accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick, portrays Spears as a student from a Catholic high school, who starts to daydream that she is singing and dancing around the school, while watching her love interest from afar. The music video was later referenced in the music video of \"If U Seek Amy\" (2009), where Spears's fictional daughter is dressed with a similar schoolgirl outfit while wearing pink ribbons in her hair. In 2010, the music video for \"...Baby One More Time\" was voted the third most influential video in the history of pop music, in a poll held by Jam!. In 2011, \"...Baby One More Time\" was voted by \"Billboard\" to be the best music video of the 1990s. It has been featured on all of her greatest hits and other compilation albums. In 2020, \"Rolling Stone\" named \"..Baby One More Time\" as the greatest debut single of all time.\n\nSpears has performed \"...Baby One More Time\" in a number of live appearances and during all of her concert tours. It was the encore of the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999) and Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001–02); Spears also performed remixed versions of the song during the Oops!...

It has been noted for redefining the sound of late 1990s music. Spears has named \"...Baby One More Time\" as one of her favorite songs from her career. It was also the final song to be played on the BBC's music programme \"Top of the Pops\" in the 1990s. It is also featured in the 2011 dance video game by Ubisoft, \"Just Dance 3\". In 2018, readers of German teen magazine \"Bravo\" magazine voted \"...Baby One More Time\" to be the biggest hit since its first music compilation was released in 1992.\n\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense. Lynne Spears asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\" Two weeks later, executives from JIVE Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that \"It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that.\" They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\" After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary\" but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since \"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me.\"\n\nFenster asked producer Max Martin to meet Spears in New York, after which he returned to Sweden to write her a handful of songs with long-term collaborator Denniz Pop. Pop was ill, so Martin asked producer Rami Yacoub to help. When six songs were ready, Spears flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded in May 1998, produced by Martin, Pop and Yacoub.\n\nMartin showed Spears and her management a track titled \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\", which was originally written for American boy band, the Backstreet Boys and the R&B group TLC; however, when the song was submitted to them, they rejected it. The label thought the song would work for the English group Five, but they also passed on it. Spears later said that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. \"We at JIVE said, 'This is a ... smash',\" revealed the label's A&R executive at the time Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line \"Hit Me\" would condone domestic violence, later being revised to \"...Baby One More Time\".\n\nSpears recorded her vocals for the song in May 1998 at Cheiron Studios. Spears revealed that she \"didn't do well at all the first day in the studio [recording the song], I was just too nervous. So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing '… Baby One More Time'.\" The song was produced by Denniz Pop, Martin and Rami, and was also mixed by Martin at Cheiron Studios. Thomas Lindberg played the guitar, while Johan Carlberg played the bass guitar. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Martin and Nana Hedin. Spears also recorded a track called \"Autumn Goodbye\", written and produced by Eric Foster White, that was released as a b-side to \"...Baby One More Time\". The track was recorded in 1998 at 4MW East Studios in New Jersey.\n\n\"...Baby One More Time\" was released as Spears's debut single on October 23, 1998, by Jive Records, when she was only sixteen years old. Spears has named \"...Baby One More Time\" as one of her favorite songs from her entire career, naming \"Toxic\" and \"He About to Lose Me\" as the other two. Like TLC and Backstreet Boys, British boy band Five were almost considered to record the song, according to their former manager Simon Cowell, who would work with Spears in the second season of the American version of \"The X Factor\" in 2012, in his autobiography \"Sweet Revenge\".\n\n\"...Baby One More Time\" is a teen pop & dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and thirty seconds. The song is composed in the key of C minor and is set in the time signature of 4/4 common time with a moderate tempo of 93 beats per minute. Songwriting and production is largely based on previous Cheiron productions, most notably Robyn Carlsson's \"Show Me Love\" which shows similar song scheme, drum patterns, wah guitars and piano hits. Spears's vocal range spans over one octave from E to C. The song begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano, an opening that has been compared to many other songs, such as \"We Will Rock You\" (1977), \"Start Me Up\" (1981), \"These Words\" (2004) and the theme song of the film \"Jaws\" due to the fact the track \"makes its presence known in exactly one second\". According to magazine \"Blender\", \"...Baby One More Time\" is composed by \"wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps\".\n\nClaudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of \"Girl Culture: Studying girl culture: a readers' guide\" (2008), noted the lyrics of the song \"gesture toward [Spears] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend.\" Spears said \"...Baby One More Time\" is a song \"every girl can relate to. She regrets it. She wants him back.\" The lyrics, however, caused controversy in the United States, because the line \"Hit me baby one more time\" supposedly has sadomasochistic connotations. As a response, the singer said the line \"doesn't mean physically hit me. [...] It means just give me a sign, basically. I think it's kind of funny that people would actually think that's what it meant.\" Music journalist John Seabrook has said \"Everybody thought it was some sort of weird allusion to domestic violence or something. But what it really was the Swedes using English incorrectly. What they really wanted to say was, “hit me up on the phone one more time” or something. But at that point, Max's English wasn't that great. So it came out sounding a little bit weird in English.\"\n\nMarc Oxoby, author of \"The 1990s\" (2003), noted the song \"was derided as vapid by some critics, yet tapped into the same kind of audience to whom the Spice Girls music appealed, young teens and pre-teens.\" Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic commented, \"[\" ... Baby One More Time\" is] well-composed, tightly arranged, and even with Spears's vocal limitations it goes straight for the proverbial pop jugular.\" She also said that the song was a highlight in the pop music genre and added, \"There is little doubt that '...Baby One More Time' will be long remembered as one of the cornerstones of pop music in general, and it is a strong front-runner as the prototype for the late 90s pop resurgence.\" Bill Lamb of About.com considered \"...Baby One More Time\" as Spears's best song, saying, \"the song is full of hooks and a big mainstream pop sound. The accompanying schoolgirl video caused a sensation, and, when the single hit No. 1, Britney was assured of stardom.\" In a list compiled by Sara Anderson of AOL Radio, \"...Baby One More Time\" was ranked sixth in a list of Spears's best songs. She noted the singer \"somehow made the school girl outfit and pink pom-pom hair-ties trendy again, worn by every tween in the succeeding years.\"\n\nBeth Johnson of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"...Baby One More Time\" a \"candy-pop-with-a-funky-edge smash\", while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the song was \"ingenious\", Brian Raftery of \"Blender\" called it \"a perfectly fine, slickly conceived pop tune. [..] At the time, teen-pop was still a boys' club, but while the guys were crooning about crushes, Spears was already planning the sleep-over party\". In 2009, Jody Rosen of \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"some of the best radio pop of the past decade-plus\". \"NME\" considered \"...Baby One More Time\" \"incredible\", commenting that \"it's a symphony of teenage lust as fully realised as anything Brian Wilson ever wrote – a truly grand pop song that overwhelms any lingering undercurrent of Lolita paedo-creepiness through the sheer fanatical earnestness of its delivery.\" \"...Baby One More Time\" won a Teen Choice Award for Single of the Year and an MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song.\n\nThe song was officially sent to the American radio stations on October 23, 1998. On November 21, 1998, \"...Baby One More Time\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 17 and topped the chart two and a half months later for two consecutive weeks, replacing R&B-singer Brandy's \"Have You Ever?\". Simultaneously, it climbed to number-one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The song reached the top spot of the Hot 100 Singles Sales and stayed there for four consecutive weeks. This eventually propelled the single to a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Though not as strong as its sales tallies, \"...Baby One More Time\" also experienced considerable airplay, becoming her first top ten hit on the Hot 100 Airplay, peaking at number eight. The single also became an all-around hit on Top 40 radio, going top ten on both the Top 40 Tracks and Rhythmic Top 40, and to number one for five weeks on the Mainstream Top 40. It spent 32 weeks on the Hot 100 and ended up at number five on Billboard magazine's year-end chart. As of June 2012, \"...Baby One More Time\" has sold 1,412,000 physical singles, with 511,000 paid digital downloads in the United States. It is Spears's best-selling physical single in the country. \"...Baby One More Time\" debuted at number 20 on the Australian Singles Chart, a month later reached number one and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. The song eventually became the second highest-selling single of the year, only behind Lou Bega's \"Mambo#5\", and was certified three-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling over 210,000 copies. In New Zealand, the single spent four non-consecutive weeks at the top of the charts and after shipping over 15,000 units to retailers the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand certified it platinum.\n\nThe track reached the top spot in every European country in which it charted. \"...Baby One More Time\" spent two consecutive weeks at number-one on the French Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique after selling over 500,000 units in the country. Additionally, the song topped the German Singles Chart for six consecutive weeks and sold over 750,000 copies, resulting in a three-times gold certification by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In the United Kingdom, according to Jive Records, \"...Baby One More Time\" sold more than 250,000 copies in a mere three days. Spears broke a first-week sales record for a female act in the UK at the time when \"...Baby One More Time\" sold a total of 460,000 copies. Eventually, the British Phonographic Industry certified it two-times platinum on March 26, 1999. The single went on to sell over 1,445,000 units by the end of 1999, making it the highest-selling single of that year and the 8th biggest song of the 1990s. As of 2018, it is the 32nd best-seller of all-time in the UK. Additionally, \"...Baby One More Time\" is the fifth best-selling single by a female artist in the country, behind Cher's \"Believe\", Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\", Adele's \"Someone like You\" and Céline Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\". \"...Baby One More Time\" is one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over 10 million copies sold worldwide. As of May 2020, \"...Baby One More Time\" has generated over 285 million streams in the US. \n\nThe music video was directed by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, \"It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched \"The Mickey Mouse Club\". She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song\". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan was to have the video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that \"Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm.\" The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, \"The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'\". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, \"It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience\". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie \"Grease\". The video premiered on MTV and other video stations on 26 November 1998.\n\nThe video begins with Spears appearing bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta played the role of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in a pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.\n\nThe schoolgirl outfit is considered to be one of Spears's iconic looks and is on display at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. The ensemble caused controversy among parents associations for showing the midriff of a sixteen-year-old. Spears faced the criticism saying, \"Me showing my belly? I'm from the South; you're stupid if you don't wear a sports bra [when you] go to dance class, you're going to be sweating your butt off.\" In 1999, \"...Baby One More Time\" earned Spears her first three MTV Video Music Award nominations, in the categories of Best Pop Video, Best Choreography, and Best Female Video. In a list compiled by VH1 in 2001, it was listed at number ninety in the best videos of all time. The video was the first of fourteen of her videos to retire on MTV's television series \"TRL\". On its final episode, a three-hour special aired on November 16, 2008, \"…Baby One More Time\" was number one in their final countdown as the most iconic music video of all time and was the last video to be played on the show. Wesley Yang in his essay \"Inside the Box\" in \"n+1\", compared the music video to Britny Fox's \"Girlschool\" because it featured \"a classroom full of Catholic schoolgirls gyrating to the beat in defiance of a stern teacher. [..] But that was a sexist video by a horrible hair metal band that exploited women. Britney Spears was something else—an inflection point in the culture\". The music video is also referenced in the music video of Spears's 2000 single, \"Stronger\" where Spears sings, \"My loneliness ain't killing me no more\" – a reference to \"...Baby One More Time\" where she sings, \"My loneliness is killing me.\" The music video is also referenced in the 2009 single, \"If U Seek Amy\". After she comes out of the house dressed as a housewife, her daughter is dressed with a similar schoolgirl outfit while wearing pink ribbons in her hair. The video was ranked at number four on a list of the ten most controversial music videos in pop by AOL on September 29, 2011. In April 2014, the music video for \"...Baby One More Time\" reached over 100 million views on VEVO becoming Spears' 5th music video to do so and making it the first '90s video by a female singer to receive a certification.\n\nThe first ever live performance of the song was at the \"Singapore Jazz Festival\" in Singapore, May 16, 1998. At this show, she also performs for the first time ever, the song \"Sometimes\". Britney performed \"...Baby One More Time\" on several occasions. She performed the song on July 6, 1999, during her appearance at the Woodstock 99 festival. Neil Strauss, from \"The New York Times\", noted that \"all the backing music was on tape, and most of the vocals were recorded, with Ms. Spears just reinforcing selected words in choruses and singing an occasional snippet of a verse\". It was also performed at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards; after a classroom roll call ended, Spears appeared on the stage and began performing the song. Halfway through, she was joined by Justin Timberlake and the members of NSYNC for a dance routine. Afterwards, the band performed their hit \"Tearin' Up My Heart\". The song was also performed at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards, along with \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\", the 1999 Billboard Music Awards, the 1999 Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, the Christmas Day edition of Top of the Pops and the Greenwich Millennium concert on 31 December 1999, she also performed it with broadcasters David Dimbleby and Michael Buerk on 2000 Today. Spears performed the song in a medley with \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" at the 42nd Grammy Awards. Spears was wearing a turtleneck and a full tulle skirt at the beginning of the performance, while dancers surrounded her with enormous hand fans. After singing a shortened version of the song, she then took a few moments to shuffle into a form-fitting red rhinestone outfit (with side cutouts) and emerged onto a stage to perform \"...Baby One More Time.\" Spears was also criticized of lipsynching the song during her performance. Later, in 2003, Spears performed the song in a remixed form at \"Britney Spears: In the Zone\", a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. \"...Baby One More Time\" was also performed at the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live on September 4, 2003, at the National Mall, in a medley with \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" (2001), which included pyrotechnics. She sported shoulder-length blond hair and was dressed in black football pants, a black-and-white referee halter top and boots from Reebok. Her outfit was later auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation.\n\n\"...Baby One More Time\" has been performed in seven of Spears's concert tours since its release. On ...Baby One More Time Tour, the encore consisted of a performance of the song, in which Spears wore a black bra under pink halter, a pink sequined plaid mini-skirt, and black thigh-high stockings. On 2000s Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, \"...Baby One More Time\" was performed after a dance interlude in which the dancers showed their individual moves while their names appeared on the screens. Spears took the stage in a conservative schoolgirl outfit to perform the song. She ripped it off halfway through the song to reveal a cheerleader ensemble. The song was also the encore of 2001's Dream Within a Dream Tour. It began with a giant projection of a hologram of Spears onto a water screen. The projection gradually shrunk until Spears rose from the stage while wearing a plastic cowboy hat, blue hip-huggers, and a matching bra top. She began performing \"...Baby One More Time\" in a ballad version until reaching the end of the runway. Pyrotechnics surrounded the stage while the song changed to a more uptempo version with elements of techno.\n\nOn The Onyx Hotel Tour, after performing \"Showdown\", a video interlude followed featuring Spears and her friends outside a club. While she was leaving, she noticed a woman dressed in 1930s fashion. She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the \"Mystic Lounge\". Spears reappeared wearing a corset to perform \"…Baby One More Time\" along with \"Oops!...I Did It Again\" and \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\". All of the three were reworked for the show with elements of jazz and blues. \"...Baby One More Time\" was also performed on the promotional tour made on some House of Blues locations, called The M+M's Tour. The show started with Spears singing a short version of the song dressed in a white go-go boots, a white miniskirt and a sparkling pink bikini top. On The Circus Starring Britney Spears, the song made into the Electro Circ act. It was the final song of the act, performed after \"Toxic\". The performance consisted on Spears and her dancers performing a remix of the song. On 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, \"...Baby One More Time\" was performed in a medley with the remix of Rihanna's \"S&M\" (2010). On Spears' current residency show in Las Vegas, the song was included on its setlist.\n\n\"…Baby One More Time\" has been covered on numerous occasions. One of the earliest live covers of the song was by the Scottish band Travis, recorded during one of their concerts at \"The Bay Tavern\" in Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire, England. The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, \"Turn\". Lead singer Francis Healey said, \"We did it for a laugh the first time. [..] And as we played it, the irony slipped from my smile. It's a very well-crafted song. It [has] that magic thing.\" \"The Guardian\" said this cover showed a new and more \"dark\" side of the band, commenting \"slowed down to a mournful crawl, it was amazing how ominous the couplet \"This loneliness is killing me / Hit me, baby, one more time\" sounded\". PopWreckoning.com called it \"perhaps the most well done cover of Britney's catalyst to eternal fame\". Spears heard their version while shopping in a mall and said, \"It was so weird. I liked it though, I thought it was cool. It was a very different vibe from what I did\".\nIn July 2005, The Dresden Dolls performed a cover during their summer concerts while opening for Panic! at the Disco. On July 18, 2006, frontman Brendon Urie joined the band to perform the song in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. PopWreckoning.com said the cover was \"a strange twist to this pop ditty. It's obviously darker and actually tortured as opposed to Britney's school girl despair\". The song was featured in a scene in Madonna's directorial debut \"Filth and Wisdom\". On November 29, 2008, the same day Spears performed \"Womanizer\" on \"The X Factor\", contestants JLS performed a cover of the song that was deemed \"lame\" by judge Simon Cowell.\n\nIn 2000, the song elements were used for the Jamaican Dancehall beat \"\" riddim. On July 13, 2009, Tori Amos covered the song live during her Sinful Attraction Tour at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California. On October 15, that year, Kris Allen covered the song for the first time at a concert in Seton High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. His rendition received positive reviews. The song is heard, prominently but briefly, during the climactic fight-scene in the 2005 animated film \"Robots\". Fender, while wearing a skirt, was busy fighting to the beat of the song. An excerpt was used in the comedy film, but was not included on the soundtrack album. Swedish humorist heavy metal band Black Ingvars covered the song for their 2000 album \"Kids Superhits\". The same year, British death metal cover band Ten Masked Men included a rendition of the song on their \"Return of the Ten Masked Men\" album. A cover by Ahmet and Dweezil Zappa was featured in the soundtrack of the 2000 film \"Ready to Rumble\". In 2003, the song was covered by American pop punk band Bowling for Soup for the soundtrack of the film \"Freaky Friday\" and commented that their version was \"really, really, dark and really rock, [..] not the kind of 'pop'-py stuff that we usually do.\" In 2005, power pop band Fountains of Wayne covered the song for their compilation album \"Out-of-State Plates\". Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" highlighted their rendition saying the song is \"as redolent and fetching as any of [Fountains of Wayne]'s peaks\". Japanese pop singer Shiori Takei covered the song of her 2005 album \"The Note of My Nineteen Years\".\n\nIn 2006, a lounge music style cover of the song by Trombo Combo was included on their covers album \"Trombo Combo: Swedish Sound Deluxe\". A hi-NRG-eurodance cover by Jayne Montgomery was released through Almighty Records. In the 2009 compilation \"Punk Goes Pop 2\", a cover of the song by metalcore band August Burns Red was included along with a cover of \"Toxic\" by A Static Lullaby. Music duo Doll Factory included a cover of the song as a bonus track on later printings of their album \"Weightless\".\nSinger-songwriter Christopher Dallman released an EP titled \"Sad Britney\" that includes a cover of the song along with covers of \"Toxic\", \"Gimme More\" and \"Radar\". The song has also been covered by Brainshake, Intwine, Kevorkian, P.T. Grimm and the Dead Puppies, Jenny Owen Youngs, Neil Sahgal and Annie Bethancourt, among others. In the 2010 \"Glee\" episode \"Britney/Brittany\", the character of Rachel Berry, played by Lea Michele, covered the song using similar outfits to the ones of the music video. Spears also made a cameo, taking the teacher's role, previously played by Cullota. Darren Criss also of \"Glee\" performed a mash-up of \"...Baby One More Time\" with \"Für Elise\" on \"Sing Out, Raise Hope\" for The Trevor Project and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in December 2011. In 2012, British singer Ed Sheeran performed an acoustic version of the song NOW 100.5 FM. A year later he covered it on \"The Elvis Duran Z100 Morning Show\" and added a rap verse. The song is sung by actresses Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine in Harmony Korine's film \"Spring Breakers\". Swedish singer Tove Styrke released a cover of the song on July 24, 2015. Charli XCX and Troye Sivan referenced the song on their single \"1999\". Anne Marie also references the song on her single \"2002\". The music video also pays homage to Spears. Both singles were released in 2018.\n\n\"…Baby One More Time\" was listed at number twenty five in the greatest pop songs since 1963, in a list compiled by \"Rolling Stone\" and MTV in 2000. \"Blender\" listed it at number nine in The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born. The song was also listed as the 2nd best song of the 1990s by VH1 and in a listing compiled in 2003, ranked at number one in 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 Years. Bill Lamb of About.com ranked \"...Baby One More Time\" at number one on a compiled list with the Top 40 Pop Songs Of All Time. The music video was voted the third most influential promo in the history of pop music on a poll held by Jam!. \"…Baby One More Time\" is also one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over 9 million copies sold, and also earned Spears's first nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. In April 2005, the British TV network ITV aired a short series called \"Hit Me, Baby, One More Time\" hosted by Vernon Kay. The show pitted one-hit wonders who generally had their moments of fame in the 1980s against each other to play their own hits and a currently popular cover song. The favorites were chosen by audience voting. The American version of the show also aired on NBC later in the year, and it was also hosted by Kay. In the 2012 poll created by The Official Chart Company and ITV to discover The Nation's Favourite Number 1 Single of all-time, \"…Baby One More Time\" was listed as the seventh favorite song by the United Kingdom. In 2018, readers of the iconic German teen magazine Bravo (magazine) voted \"...Baby One More Time\" to be the biggest hit since its first music compilation was released in 1992.\n\nSpears became an international pop culture icon immediately after launching her recording career. \"Billboard\"'s Robert Kelly observed that Spears's \"sexy and coy\" vocals on the track \"kicked off a new era of pop vocal stylings that would influence countless artists to come.\" \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote: \"One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 2000s\" she \"spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop ... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that generated lots of cash\". Barbara Ellen of \"The Observer\" has reported: \"Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry\".\n\nScott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork noted \"songs like Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", Dr. Dre's \"Nothing But a G Thang\", and Britney Spears's \" ... Baby One More Time\" altered the landscape of pop culture so quickly in large part because they were delivered to all corners of the U.S. simultaneously by MTV. ... MTV's ability to place a song and musician into the pop music conversation was unparalleled at the time, and by the end of the decade that meant absurd levels of both financial and creative commitment to music videos.\" PopMatters writer Evan Sawdey commented that Spears's concept for the music video of the song was the one responsible for her immediate success, saying that, as a result, the singer \"scored a massive No. 1 single, inadvertently started the late '90s teen pop boom, and created a public persona for herself that was simultaneously kid-friendly and pure male fantasy. Her videos got played on both MTV and the Disney Channel at the same time, showing just how well Spears (and her armies of PR handlers) managed to walk that fine line between family-friendly pop idol and unabashed sex object.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits for \"...Baby One More Time\" and \"Autumn Goodbye\" are taken from the single's liner notes.\n...Baby One More Time\n\nAutumn Goodbye\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Digital\n\n\n\n"}

The railroad is owned by Railroad Development Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe railroad was formed on November 2, 1984, using former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad tracks between Chicago, Illinois, and Omaha, Nebraska. It was in partnership with real estate firm Heartland Rail Corporation that the IAIS was able to operate. Heartland purchased the right-of-way and infrastructure for $31 million (of which, $15 million was a loan from the Iowa Railway Finance Authority), and then leased it to IAIS for operations.\n\nThe IAIS and the railroad infrastructure were purchased from Heartland by Railroad Development Company of Pittsburgh, PA in 2003.\n\nIn recognition of the railroad's Rock Island Railroad heritage, the IAIS logo uses a shape similar to the original railroad's logo and has also painted two of its General Electric ES44AC locomotives (513 and 516) in Rock Island inspired paint schemes.\n\nWhen the IAIS took control of the track, the former Rock Island signal system was already damaged beyond repair due to sitting dormant for several years. Operations on the railroad are primarily controlled by track warrants rather than signals as a result. \n\nTrains are dispatched from the company's HQ in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where a new dispatching office was completed in 2016. IAIS uses Wabtec's Train Management and Dispatching System (TMDS), the same dispatching software used by several Class I railroads, including the BNSF and KCS.\n\nThe railroad's mainline is roughly a straight line between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Chicago, Illinois, with a branch line connecting Bureau to Peoria, Illinois. The mainline is separated into 4 Subdivisions:\n\nThe railroad also includes the: \n\nThe Iowa Interstate operates from Bureau to Chicago over the former Rock Island tracks controlled by CSX and Metra. In Chicago the IAIS owns two yard facilities, Burr Oak Yard and Evans Yard (the site of former rail car builder Evans), both in Blue Island, Illinois.\n\nThe Iowa Interstate is unique in that it is the only Class II railroad in the US that has connections to every Class I railroad, affording its customers a reach not offered by other regional railroads.\n\nThe railroad also maintains two intermodal operations at either end of its line in Chicago and Council Bluffs. The operation in Council Bluffs is also used by the Union Pacific, with IAIS crews inter-changing with UP several times a day.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, the IAIS mainline has been identified as a potential route for high speed passenger train service between Wyanet, Illinois (where the IAIS could be connected to the BNSF Railway), the Quad Cities and Iowa City, Iowa, as part of the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative (MRRI). The ultimate goal of the MRRI is to establish passenger train routes in a hub-and-spoke formation with Chicago as the hub that allow for speeds up to and above 110 mph (177 km/h).\n\nIn July 2019, a new transportation bill was passed by the Illinois state legislature, supported by Governor J.B. Pritzker, $225M was appropriated to begin Amtrak service from Chicago to Moline, IL. A rail connector (junction) will be built between BNSF and IAIS to permit Quad Cities Rocket to use BNSF mainline from Wyanet to Chicago Union Station. This Amtrak route will use the IAIS main line between Wyanet and Moline, IL. Upgrades to IAIS rail crossings, track, and signaling for Amtrak’s 79-mph requirements will be performed.\n\nIAIS subsidiary Rail Traffic Control formerly provided consulting services for dispatching and operating small- to medium-sized railroads worldwide.\n\nIn 2004, IAIS was awarded the E. H. Harriman Award for its safe operational record.\n\nIAIS uses 42 locomotives and two slugs to power its trains:\n\nIn 2006, IAIS also purchased two ex-China Railways QJ 2-10-2 steam locomotives, numbered 6988 and 7081 for special excursion trains and fundraising events. 6988 has been \"Americanized\", with a paint scheme inspired by American locomotives. 7081 retains its original China Railways paint with Iowa Interstate badges. In 2018 the 6988 made excursion trips to raise money for local volunteer fire departments in Brooklyn and Mitchellville, Iowa. \n\nThe 6988 ran charity fundraisers in 2019 in both Iowa and Illinois. The first trips took place on May 18th running between Henry and Chillicothe, Illinois, and May 19th running between Annawan and Geneseo, Illinois.

It flows from central Monmouth County, beginning in Freehold Township, to the Atlantic Ocean, where it empties between the communities of Manasquan and Point Pleasant via the Manasquan Inlet. It widens greatly as it nears the ocean, making it ideal for boating, and is a very popular recreational area of the Jersey Shore. The Manasquan River and Inlet is the unofficial northernmost terminus of the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\nThe river is the center of a large watershed area that incorporates numerous streams as well as a large man-made pumped (i.e. no direct flow from the river) reservoir in Howell Township; aptly named the Manasquan Reservoir. It also marks the traditional boundary between North Jersey and South Jersey; it separates Monmouth and Ocean counties and marks the border between rich, fertile soil to the north and the sandier soil of the \"Pine Barrens\" to the south.\n\nSituated in the middle of the river east of the New Jersey Route 70 highway bridge and adjacent to the former Point Pleasant Hospital site and Point Pleasant Canal entrance is a sizable island only accessible by boat that is a popular spot for picnics and recreation. The island includes a sandy beach area and even used to have an improvised swingset for youngsters which has been removed by the boro of Brielle, but is mainly covered with trees. The water surrounding the island is deep enough to accommodate boat traffic, and boaters normally beach their boats on the sand while they enjoy a day of relaxation on the island. Today its officially named Nienstedt Island, honoring the family who donated it to the borough. In the 19th century it was known as \"Osborn Island\". In May 1888, Robert Louis Stevenson spent about a month in Brielle along the Manasquan River. One day Stevenson visited Osborn Island and was so impressed he whimsically renamed it \"Treasure Island\" after his famous novel \"Treasure Island\" (1883) and carved his initials into a bulkhead. This took place five years after he had completed the novel. To this day, many still refer to the island as such.\n\nThe navigable Manasquan River and its tributaries are crossed by three drawbridges, the Brielle Road Glimmer Glass Bridge, the Route 35 Manasquan River bridge, and the NJ Transit railroad bridge, and one fixed bridge – the Route 70 September 11 Memorial Bridge.\n\n\n"}

Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.\n\nThe opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building stratified (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is intuitionistic type theory, which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.\n\nRussell's paradox is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The paradox is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.\n\nThe greatest lower bound of a set , , also has an impredicative definition: if and only if for all elements of , is less than or equal to , and any less than or equal to all elements of is less than or equal to . This definition quantifies over the set (potentially infinite, depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of , one of which being the glb itself. Hence predicativism would reject this definition.\n\nThe terms \"predicative\" and \"impredicative\" were introduced by , though the meaning has changed a little since then. \n\nSolomon Feferman provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.\n\nThe vicious circle principle was suggested by Henri Poincaré (1905-6, 1908) and Bertrand Russell in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called \"impredicative\".\n\nThe first modern paradox appeared with Cesare Burali-Forti's 1897 \"A question on transfinite numbers\" and would become known as the Burali-Forti paradox. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) \"naive\" set theory and this become known as Cantor's paradox. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901 with his reading of Frege's treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 \"Begriffsschrift\"; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:\nIn other words, given the function is the variable and is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value for itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:\nFrege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:\nWhile the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that \"The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in \"The principles of mathematics\" (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...\". Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by \"propounding his \"axiom of reducibility\". It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a \"predicative\" function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments\". But this \"axiom\" was met with resistance from all quarters.\n\nThe rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the natural numbers as classically understood) leads to the position in the philosophy of mathematics known as predicativism, advocated by Henri Poincaré and Hermann Weyl in his \"Das Kontinuum\". Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.\n\nErnst Zermelo in his 1908 \"A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering\" presents an entire section \"b. \"Objection concerning nonpredicative definition\"\" where he argued against \"Poincaré (1906, p. 307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it \"excludes\" all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it\". He gives two examples of impredicative definitions – (i) the notion of Dedekind chains and (ii) \"in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined \"completed\" set of numbers is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof...\". He ends his section with the following observation: \"A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition \"definiens\" and \"definiendum\" are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible\".\n\nZermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined \"completed\" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of least upper bound in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 \"Das Kontinuum\" (\"The Continuum\") to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the \"theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)\".\n\nRamsey argued that \"impredicative\" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of \"tallest person in the room\" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: if and only if for all elements of , is less than or equal to , and is in .\n\nBurgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of Frege's logic, Peano arithmetic, second order arithmetic, and axiomatic set theory.\n\n\n"}

The band combine the hostility of thrash metal riffs with electronic samples usually associated with industrial music. Their lyrics generally focus on bleak sexual visions and pain over troubled relationships.\n\nThe band was formed in January, 1993, by Patrik Wiren (vocals) and Örjan Örnkloo (guitar, bass, programming). Wiren was previously a member of Midas Touch who had recorded an album with Noise Records, while Örnkloo worked with several bands within his Swedish hometown, Uppsala. Their first recorded track was \"Sonic Attack\" for a metal compilation \"Extreme Close Up\". Based on the response to the single the band worked with MNW Zone to release their self-titled debut album, \"Misery Loves Co.\", in 1995. Independent success lead to signing with Earache Records which re-released the album throughout Europe.\n\nDuring live performances, Misery added Jim Edwards (guitar), Marre Ericksson (bass), and Olle Dahlstedt (drums), who was replaced by Niklas Gabrielsson before their first UK show, at the Camden Underworld. The band opened for Clawfinger and then for Warrior Soul, Headswim, and Clawfinger later in the year.\n\nMisery's US debut disc featured a promotional CD with the track \"Need Another One\" remixed by similar bands such as Killing Joke and Pitchshifter. In 1996, the band returned with an EP, \"Happy?\", which featured seven tracks and a collection of multimedia bonuses. The band toured with Slayer and Fear Factory before their second album, \"Not like Them\", was released in 1997. The record reached number 12 on \"Kerrang!\" 's Top 20 in 1997. Misery then toured Europe, supporting Machine Head. Their last and softer album, \"Your Vision Was Never Mine to Share\", was released in March 2000. Another European tour followed, with Kill II This and earthtone9, but in late 2000 Misery Loves Co. announced their splitting.\n\nPatrik Wiren went on to form the band Alpha Safari (formerly named Washoe) with some former live members from Misery Loves Co.

The sponsors are the Anglican Consultative Council and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity (formerly the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity).\n\nARCIC seeks to identify common ground between the two communions. Ecumenical relations have become strained, owing to the ordination of women within the Anglican Communion and, in more recent years, the Anglican communion has internally become increasingly more divided over issues concerning homosexuality.\n\nThree meetings were conducted by the Anglican–Roman Catholic Joint Preparatory Commission (ARCJPC) from 1967 to 1968. The first preparatory meeting was held in Italy, a meeting on the place of scripture in England and culminating in a meeting in Malta culminating in the Malta Report.\n\nThe first phase was conducted by the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) from 1970 to 1982.\n\nThe first phase of ARCIC was held under the aegis of Henry McAdoo (Anglican Archbishop of Dublin) and Alan Clark (Roman Catholic Bishop of East Anglia). The co-secretaries were Anglicans Colin Davey and Christopher Hill and the Roman Catholic William A. Purdy.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971 there were a number of meetings on eucharistic doctrine, producing an agreed statement. An elucidation was issued in 1979.\n\nIn 1972 there was a meeting on the subject of ordination. It paved the way for an agreed statement from Canterbury. An elucidation was issued in 1979.\n\nIn the mid-1970s a number of meetings were held on the issue of authority culminating in a statement made at Venice. Further discussions on the subject of authority were held in 1977, 1979, and 1980; with elucidations and a further statement issued in 1981 with the final statement.\n\nA final statement for \"ARCIC I\" was issued in 1981. There were responses from both the Lambeth Conference and the Catholic Church. Further clarifications on the Eucharist and Ministry were issued in 1993.\n\nThe second phase was conducted by the Second Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC II) from 1983 to 2006. The second phase co-chairs were the Anglican bishops Mark Santer, Frank Griswold, and Peter Carnley; and the Roman Catholic bishops Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, and Alexander Joseph Brunett. A number of Anglican and Roman Catholic clerics served as co-secretaries.\n\nThe topics covered by included the doctrine of salvation, communion, teaching authority, and the role of Mary the mother of God.\n\nIn 2000, ARCIC II supported a meeting of 13 pairs of Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops from around the globe at Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.

This states that \"The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the ministry of the Bishop of Rome [the Pope] as universal primate is in accordance with Christ's will for the Church and an essential element of maintaining it in unity and truth.\" Not only that but the document goes on to say that \"We urge Anglicans and Roman Catholics to explore together how the ministry of the Bishop of Rome might be offered and received in order to assist our Communions to grow towards full, ecclesial communion.\"\n\nThe third phase was conducted by the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission III (ARCIC-III) from 2011 to .\n\nThe third phase started from 17–27 May 2011 at the ecumenical Bose Monastic Community in northern Italy. The third phase of ARCIC will be to consider fundamental questions regarding the \"Church as Communion – Local and Universal,\" and \"How in Communion the Local and Universal Church Comes to Discern Right Ethical Teaching.\" The opening meeting also noted Catholic—Anglican tensions over the creation of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, directly subject to the Holy See, earlier the same year in order to make easier the transition by Anglican congregations (not just individuals) wishing to move into communion with the Catholic Church. The third phase has held several meetings.\n\nThe co-chairmen of this phase:\n\nRoman Catholic members: \n\nAnglican members:\n\nARCIC has met with some hostile reaction from Traditionalist Catholics. Although ARCIC had just completed the major document on Marian theology in 2003, Pope John Paul II suspended official talks between the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, owing to the consecration of Gene Robinson, a homosexual man in a non-celibate relationship, as a bishop in the Episcopal Church in the United States. Moreover, the ordination of women, especially to the episcopacy, has repeatedly been questioned by the Roman Catholic Church leadership as harmful to Christian unity. Walter Kasper, President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, put it this way: The ordination of women to the episcopate \"signified a breaking away from apostolic tradition and a further obstacle for reconciliation between the Catholic Church and the Church of England.\" He also seemed more upset about the warring parties within Anglicanism: \"He described the legislation for those opposed to women's ordained ministry in the Church of England as the 'unspoken institutionalism' of an 'existing schism.'\" At the opening of the May 2011 meeting, British journalist William Oddie claimed that ARCIC activities were useless, as only the Catholic side had a clear agenda and described all ecumenical activity as leading to a dead end. The ARCIC III Co Chairmen replied saying each communion was formally committed to continuing this sacred task at the highest level. They referred to substantial common ground while acknowledging the existence of significant obstacles, but said they trusted in the power of the Holy Spirit to draw the two communions closer.\n\n\n\n"}

It shares borders with the Hungarian counties Csongrád, Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok, and Hajdú-Bihar. The capital of Békés county is Békéscsaba. The county is also part of the Danube-Kris-Mures-Tisa euroregion.\n\nIn Slovak, it is known as \"Békešská župa\" and in Romanian as \"Județul Bichiș\".\n\nAfter Hungarians conquered the area, Békés and its surroundings were the property of the \"Csolt\" clan. Békés (the name means \"peaceful\") was originally the name of the castle which gave its name to the comitatus, and, like many castles, was possibly named after its first steward.\n\nThis county has a total area of – 6.05% of Hungary.\n\nBékés County lies on the Pannonian Plain (Great Plain) and is a flat area with good soil. The average rainfall is 645 mm per year. One-fifth of the natural gas resources of Hungary can be found in Békés. The river Körös runs through the county.\n\n\nThe area has been inhabited since 5000-4000 BC. Before the arrival of the Hungarians several other tribes lived in the area.\n\nThe castle of Gyula was built in the early 15th century. Gyula was the most significant town of the county at that time, and became the county seat under Matthias I. It was an important fortress during the Ottoman wars in Europe but it was captured in 1566. During this time, several towns were destroyed in the area.\n\nIn the early 18th century, after the Ottomans were expelled, the county was repopulated, not only with Hungarians, but with Slovaks (in the towns Békéscsaba, Endrőd, Szarvas, Tótkomlós), Serbs (Battonya), Germans (Németgyula, Elek), and Romanians (Kétegyháza). Most of the non-Magyar population was assimilated by the mid-19th century.\n\nThe agricultural importance of the county and the new railway line between Pest and Békéscsaba (finished in 1858) brought development, which was quickened when Hungary lost its southern territories to Romania after World War I and Békéscsaba had to take over the role of the lost cities.\n\nThe population growth peaked in 1950 (472,000), in the same year when Békéscsaba became the county seat. During the following years, the county was industrialized, like most of Hungary, and the population of the cities and towns grew.\n\nIn 2015, it had a population of 351,148 and the population density was 62/km².\nMore than 60% of the population lives in towns.\n\nBesides the Hungarian majority, the main minorities are the Roma (approx. 9,500), Slovak (7,500), Romanian (5,000), German (2,500) and Serb (500).\n\nTotal population (2011 census): 359,948\nEthnic groups (2011 census):\nIdentified themselves: 325,597 persons:\nApprox. 53,000 persons in Békés County did not declare their ethnic group at the 2011 census.\n\nReligious adherence in the county according to 2011 census:\n\n\nThe Békés County Council, elected at the 2019 local government elections, is made up of 17 counselors, with the following party composition:\n\nBékés County has 1 urban county, 21 towns, 8 large villages and 45 villages.\n\nThe regional structure of Békés county is typical of the Great Plain: it has a small number of villages, but those are large, both by area and by population.

He bought six 1950s Stratocasters for two or three hundred US dollars each. After giving one each to George Harrison, Pete Townshend, and Steve Winwood, he took the best parts of the remaining three (built c. 1956 and 1957) and Nashville luthier Ted Newman Jones assembled \"Blackie\", so named for its black finish.\n\nClapton first played Blackie live 13 January 1973 at the Rainbow Concert. Clapton would play Blackie for many years on and off stage (such as in his guest appearance in \"The Last Waltz\"); finally, after the Behind The Sun tour in 1985, it was retired due to issues with the neck. In 1988, the Eric Clapton Stratocaster was released, according to Clapton's specifications; he began playing his new signature model shortly after.\n\nBlackie was seen again by the public for a 1990 television commercial for the Japanese automobile firm Honda when, at the specific request of the company, Clapton used Blackie to record a new guitar solo on \"Bad Love\" in New York and was filmed for the commercial doing so. Blackie was also brought out on stage for one number during the Royal Albert Hall shows in 1991. In 2019, the guitar was on display at the \"\"Play it Loud!\"\" exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, also featuring other instruments from iconic musicians.\n\nClapton played \"Blackie\" almost exclusively on stage and in the studio from 1974-1985 recording hits such as \"Cocaine\", \"I Shot The Sheriff\", \"Wonderful Tonight\", \"Farther Up the Road\", \"Lay Down Sally\" and various live versions of \"Layla\" featured on several album covers and videos.\n\nIn 2004, Blackie was sold for 959,500 USD at a Christie's auction to support the Crossroads Centre, a drug and alcohol addiction rehabilitation centre founded by Clapton. The auction's winner was the music equipment chain Guitar Center, and the bid set the record for the world's most expensive guitar. In 2006, another Stratocaster—signed by a large group of celebrities, including Clapton—was auctioned to benefit the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, selling for US$2.8 million surpassing Blackie's record.\n\nIn November 2006, Fender announced a limited run of 275 Blackie reissues by the Fender Custom Shop, identical to the original. They were released on 24 November 2006 and sold out within hours. The original Blackie was exhaustively examined and measured for the reproduction. The reproduction Blackies were constructed by a team of master builders, with each of the various 275 produced being assigned to one master builder.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Kremenchuk, Russian Empire, to his father Yehuda. He eventually married Batya Wissel, daughter of Avraham Wissel and had one son, Moshe, before leaving the Russian Empire. He received a traditional education and began working as a clerk in a warehouse. He may have been a member of the Hovevei Zion movement.\n\nHis generosity began at age twenty when he and his friend purchased a lottery ticket in monthly payments. Eventually his friend could not keep up the payments, so Reuven continued paying for his friend's portion of the lottery. He eventually won a large sum of money and gave half of the winnings to his friend as if his friend had continued paying all along. It is assumed he used the money to then travel to Israel. He apparently met a group of Bilu pioneers made up of twelve men where, at the port of Smyrna, all of their money was stolen from their cashier, Israel Belkind. Reuven gave them 100 rubles and continued the trip to Palestine. In Jaffa he joined the \"Pioneers of Jewish Settlement Committee\" or \"Halutzey Yesud HaMaala\" which eventually bought the land for Rishon Le Zion from Tzvi Leventine. Ten families set up the village and Reuven sent money to get the group of pioneers he had met in Smyrna so that they could purchase passage to Palestine. The migrations at this time to Palestine are known as The First Aliya.\n\nReuven was considered to be one of the more liberal members of the community and supported the young Biluim Pioneers who came to work in the village and played an active role in public life. He planted a vineyard, built a house, and became a farmer and vine grower. Active in the local council, he was in charge of external relations, street improvements, and sanitation. He was active in politics and his home was known as a center of poetry and classical music. He and Batya had eight more children while living in Rishon Le Zion. His firstborn, Morris Youdelevitz Young, was a notable doctor in Persia. \n\nIt is believed that he also participated in the building of Tel Aviv where he moved in 1927. He died in 1933 and was buried in Tel Aviv.\n"}

{"id": "1930464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930464", "title": "Erotic humiliation", "text": "Erotic humiliation\n\nErotic humiliation is consensual psychological humiliation performed in order to produce erotic excitement or sexual arousal. This can be for either the person(s) being humiliated and demeaned or the person(s) humiliating, or both. It is sometimes performed before spectators, including pornography and webcam viewers. It may be part of BDSM and other sexual roleplay, or accompanied by the sexual stimulation of the genitals (or other erotic region) of one or both parties in the activity.\n\nHumiliation is a subjective issue and is dependent on context. It does not need to be sexual in nature; as with many other sexual activities, it is the feelings that are obtained from the experience that are desired, regardless of the nature of the actual activity. Usually there is a feeling of submission for the person being humiliated and dominance for the person implementing the humiliation. As with other types of dominant-submissive play, it is the submissive who is in control; the submissive sets the limits, because the submissive is free to leave if his or her demands are not met.\n\nErotic humiliation can be done verbally, physically, or both, and can be either private or public. Some individuals assume an acting role and others prefer to be spoken to in a degrading way. A classic technique that can be used to put the submissive into a bottom mind space is to humiliate them while also providing them with sexual stimulation. Select individuals who desire this form of humiliation also use it to acquire emotional release. Humiliation can become ritualized, and unlike some sexual variations, it can also be easily carried out over a long distance (such as online).\n\nWhile fantasy and fascination with erotic humiliation is a prevalent part of BDSM and other sexual roleplay, relatively little has been written on it. Humiliation play can, however, be taken to a point where it becomes emotionally or psychologically distressing to one or the other partner, especially if it is public humiliation. Erotic humiliation can become extreme enough to be considered a form of edgeplay, which some consider may best be approached with advance negotiation and use of a safeword.\n\nThe most common name for the individual being humiliated is the \"bottom\", and the opposite individual who humiliates the bottom is often called the \"top\". However, these terms are standard ones that are used in general dominant/submissive roleplay and are not specific to humiliation interests.\n\n\nWhile elements of erotic humiliation may be part of a number of domination and submission-based activities, humiliation is not the same as submission. The recipient does not necessarily seek to be ordered about. Humiliation comes into its own as a sexual force when the recipient seeks the humiliation over and above means. For example, being spanked is primarily valued because of the belittlement involved. Humiliation therefore encompasses a range of paraphilia, including foot fetish, breast fetish, shoe fetish, body worship, spanking, bondage, and most BDSM styles. It can be as basic as the desire to kiss and massage feet as a precursor to sex; and it can be complex, involving roleplay and public displays of subservience. It can also be for a set period of time (a \"scene\") or an ongoing facet of a relationship. The \"humiliation\" is not intrinsic to the act or the object. Rather, it is semiotically charged by the shared attitude of the partners engaged in the act. They invest specific acts, objects, or body parts with a humiliating aspect.\n\nMany scenarios may give rise to sexual humiliation. Some scenarios may be based on verbal abuse and others on physical aspects.\n\n\n\nSome sexual humiliation involves physical inflicting pain, but much of it is far more concerned with ridicule, mocking, degradation, and embarrassment.\n\nSexual roleplaying can involve humiliation. For example, one person might play the part of a dog because they enjoy being mock-forced into it, and the top might emphasize the lowness of the bottom's status as an animal, whereas another person might play the role of the dog without any element of humiliation, simply as an expression of an inner animal or playful spirit.\n\nHumiliation in general stimulates the same brain regions that are associated with physical pain, the inference being that humans evolved to remember social rewards and punishments as strongly as they recall physical reward or pain in response to their environment. As with any form of pain experimentation in a sexual context, consent and (paradoxically) a high degree of awareness and communication are needed to ensure that the result is desirable, rather than abusive. For example, a submissive may enjoy being insulted in some ways but would be genuinely crushed and devastated if humiliated or insulted in other ways.\n\nHumiliation play is also connected to sexual fetishism, in that non-sexual activities may become sexualised by association with arousal, and also may be associated with exhibitionism in the sense of wanting others to witness (or being aroused by others witnessing) one's sexual degradation.\n\nFor some people, activities such as name-calling are a way of achieving ego reduction or getting over sexual inhibitions. For example, between gay people, terms usually associated with homophobia may be used, such as \"faggot\" and \"dyke\".\n\nAs with all sexual activities, some people have sexual fantasies about humiliation, and others actually undertake it as a lifestyle or in a scene. Sexual fantasies relating to mild humiliation are common. Some humiliation roleplay (pup-play and age play in particular) is combined with loyalty and care-giving to the extent that these fetishes can be seen as exercises in trust rather than primarily a humiliation fetish. The desire to be beneath the other partner during intercourse, the idea of \"getting caught\" (as in having sex in the garden or woods), and simulated rape are emotional games that emphasise status, vulnerability, and control. However, for most people such ideas remain fantasies; the people would have strong reservations about the fantasies' being made public, or engaged in with a partner in real life, however erotic the idea may be. When someone reveals a fetish to a partner, this usually is a result of great trust. However, the desire to be humiliated may be a motivating cause for confession, in that the act of confessing can itself be humiliating. Many people worry about being ridiculed for their fetishes, and such ridicule from their partners could be psychologically catastrophic. Therefore, many people use online humiliation (in which the humiliator and others are involved via the Internet, using chat, email, websites, etc.) as a compromise between exhibitionism and reality on the one hand, and safety and anonymity on the other.\n\nOnline humiliation is the desire to be seen in a sexually embarrassing context on the Internet. This practice allows the submissive to seek fetish partners from across the world. As the Internet has grown and continues to grow, so does online humiliation. Anecdotal reports indicate that the proportion of men being dominated by women on the Internet, through some type of personal service provided for a fee by the woman, vastly exceeds the instances of a woman being dominated online by a man, or another woman.\n\nCommon methods of online humiliation:\n\n\nThese practices can be conducted through chat, webcam, e-mail, BDSM contact websites, and proprietary virtual spaces such as \"Second Life\" or FetLife.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

However, the young man's family disapproves of him associating with people of the lower classes.\nBoth the manga and anime versions of \"Emma\" are unique for being set in a setting seldom visited by either medium without some fantasy or speculative element. The author and illustrator of the manga, Kaoru Mori, is a self-professed Anglophile, and attempted to recreate 1895 London with meticulous detail. The manga has a cult following in Japan, even going as far as opening an \"Emma\"-inspired and themed maid café in Shinjuku. Its popularity has sparked an interest in English maid cosplay, even going as far as having the official \"Emma\" anime website selling Emma's \"costume\" for ¥45,000.\n\n\n\"Emma\" is drawn in a meticulously crosshatched pen and ink style, and Mori is noted for the depth and accuracy of her research in creating the characters and settings. A companion reference called the \"Emma Victorian Guide\" has been published to explain many of the unfamiliar and obscure historical references. Emma appears on all the cover of the volumes of the manga series. From volume 3 of the manga on, Kaoru Mori hired a historical consultant, Rico Murakami, to ensure the historical accuracy of the manga. Murakami also became the historical consultant for the anime series.\n\nThe main story of \"Emma\" serialization run in Enterbrain's \"Comic Beam\" was between the January 2002 and May 2006 issues, ending at 52 chapters, corresponding to the end of the seventh collected volume. The author has since been creating additional stories in the same setting, focusing on characters beyond Emma and William. These stories were serialized in \"Comic Beam\" as between the September 2006 and March 2008 issues, and are collected as additional volumes of \"Emma\". Volume 8 in Japan was released in a special edition that included a DVD ().\n\nThe novelisations are written by Saori Kumi, and based upon the original manga.\n\n\n\nThe manga was adapted into a TV anime series, entitled , directed by Tsuneo Kobayashi, scripted by Mamiko Ikeda, and produced by Studio Pierrot and TBS. The first season of the anime series premiered between April 2 and June 18, 2005 across Japan on several UHF TV stations, BS-i and the CS TV network Animax, who have also later aired the series across its respective networks worldwide, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, also translating and dubbing the series into English for its English language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia, and other regions.\n\nThe Japanese title of the anime is written using a couple of kanji from before the adoption of simplified characters after the end of World War II, which reflects the usage of kanji in the time period the story is set in. In modern Japanese 英國戀物語 (Eikoku Koi Monogatari, lit. \"English Lovestory\" or \"Lovestory in England\") would be written as 英国恋物語, the characters for country and love being replaced by their modern variants. The series' official English title is \"Emma - A Victorian Romance\".\n\nThe series' depiction of Victorian England was accurate, with locations such as London's King's Cross station, The Crystal Palace, Covent Garden, Mudie's Lending Library and such vehicles and applications of the era, such as Henson's Aerial Steam Carriage, recreated in meticulous detail.\n\nThe anime series was continued in a second season, , which premiered in Japan on numerous television stations from April 16, 2007. Animated by Ajia-do Animation Works and directed by Tsuneo Kobayashi and written by Mamiko Ikeda, the second season was first announced by the anime's official website in August 2006 and the September 2006 issue of manga publisher Enterbrain's \"Comic Beam\" magazine, in which the original manga has been serialized.\n\nBoth seasons have been licensed in English by Nozomi Entertainment, with a box set of the first season released on June 24, 2008 in English subtitles. On September 18, 2018, Nozomi Entertainment launched a Kickstarter campaign in an attempt to gather funds to produce an English dub for season 1 for $110,000, along with a $180,000 stretch goal for season 2, following their successful Kickstarter campaign in 2017 for \"Aria\". The campaign ended on October 18, 2018 as a success, with a total of $253,834 raised; 130% over the original goal. \n\nTwo pieces of theme music are used for both seasons; one opening theme and one ending theme each. The first season's opening theme is \"Silhouette of a Breeze\" composed and arranged by Kunihiko Ryo, and the ending theme is \"Menuet for EMMA\" composed by Kunihiko Ryo, arranged by Kenji Kaneko, and performed by the Tokyo Recorder Orchestra. The second season's opening theme is a \"Celtic Version\" of \"Silhouette of a Breeze\" and the ending theme is \"Rondo of Lilybell\". Both \"Menuet for EMMA\" and \"Rondo of Lilybell,\" are done mostly with a recorder.

It is affiliated with the Christian and Missionary Alliance and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\n\nIn 1916, The Alliance Training Home was founded by Rev. J.D. Williams in St. Paul, Minnesota. The initial class at the school was five graduates. In 1922, the name was changed to the St. Paul Training School of the Christian Missionary Alliance. In 1935, the school moved from Sherburne Avenue to Englewood Avenue, and in 1936 the name was changed again to the St. Paul Bible Institute. In 1956, St. Paul Bible College added Men's Basketball and began their athletic program; in 1958, the school added a women's basketball program. In 1959, the name changed a fourth time to St. Paul Bible College. \n\nIn 1963, some open property in the St. Paul suburb of Arden Hills, about five miles north of the existing campus came to the attention of the college's leadership. Arden Hills was then and is the home to Bethel University. The Board studied the site and in 1963 purchased 35 acres of land for $70,000 with the intent to build a new campus on it. Plans were developed for the construction of a new campus, including a long, curving academic-administrative-gymnasium building, four tear-shaped dorms, and a circular chapel. However, due to high-interest rates, a lot of capital was needed to begin construction, and construction never began. \n\nThe College, looking for a new home, finalized a deal to buy a Jesuit College with the main building in the shape of a cross in St. Bonifacius, Minnesota. The deal was completed in September 1969, when St. Paul Bible College bought the 173-acre campus for $3.1 million on an 8% contract for deed. In the autumn of 1970, St. Paul Bible College moved onto the land. This remains the main campus for Crown. \n\nIn 1984, St. Paul Bible College added a collegiate football program. In 1992, the College made its last name change to its current name, Crown College. In 2013, the college announced that Dr. Joel Wiggins would be the school's 16th president, and is currently the school's president. The school celebrated its hundredth anniversary in 2016.\nCrown College offers over 40 undergraduate degree programs in numerous fields of study.

Among Weintraub's contemporaries and friends were authors Mordecai Richler, Mavis Gallant, Norman Levine and Brian Moore.\n\nWeintraub's satirical 1979 novel \"The Underdogs\" provoked controversy by imagining a future socialist republic of Quebec, in which English-speakers were an oppressed minority, complete with a violent resistance movement. One planned stage version was cancelled before its premiere, but another version was later a hit at the Just For Laughs festival.\n\nIn a film career spanning decades, Weintraub was involved with more than 150 NFB productions, serving variously as writer, producer and director. Productions ranged from \"Canada: Beef Cattle\" to historical documentaries to a portrait of Canadian writer Margaret Laurence. His 1993 documentary \"The Rise and Fall of English Montreal\" dealt with the second large Quebec diaspora that began in the 1960s and accelerated rapidly after the 1976 Quebec election. The \"National Post\" wrote that he said that Torontonians should express their gratitude to a major benefactor of the city and erect a very large heroic statue at the head of Bay Street of former Premier of Quebec René Lévesque.\n\nWeintraub published four books after his seventieth birthday including \"City Unique\" (1996), an exploration of English Montreal in the 1940s and 1950s, which received the QSPELL Prize for Non-Fiction from the Quebec Writers' Federation Awards.\n\nIn 2003, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1919 he acquired the Château de Mivoisin, a 36 square kilometre property located 1½ hours south of Paris in Dammarie-sur-Loing, Loiret.\n\nIn 1946, he financed Christian Dior's new Paris fashion house that became one of the most famous clothing and perfume marques in history. In 1951 Boussac expanded into the newspaper business with the acquisition of \"L'Aurore\".\n\nAn avid horseman, Marcel Boussac acquired the Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard horse breeding farm in Neuvy-au-Houlme in Lower Normandy and the Haras de Jardy in Marnes-la-Coquette. As part of his breeding operation, Boussac bought and sold horses from across Europe plus from the United States. He acquired the U.S. Triple Crown winner Whirlaway and sold the mare La Troienne to Edward R. Bradley's Idle Hour Stock Farm in Lexington, Kentucky who became one of the most influential mares to be imported into the U.S. in the 20th century.\n\nBoussac's horses dominated French racing from the 1930s through to the 1960s making his stable the leading money winner fourteen times and the leading breeder on seventeen occasions. In addition to being a six-time winner of France's most important race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Boussac's horses also won the prestigious Epsom Derby, Epsom Oaks, 2,000 Guineas, St. Leger Stakes, Ascot Gold Cup and others in the United Kingdom.\n\nWith the Fall of France in the Second World War, Boussac paid a British Royal Air Force officer on secret business to fly him from Paris to the UK. This caused the officer Sidney Cotton to be removed from his position. During the German occupation of France in World War II, the Nazis seized some of the best racehorses in the country. They shipped more than six hundred of them out of the country, some to Hungary but most back to Germany for racing or for breeding at the German National Stud. Among them was the champion Pharis, owned by Marcel Boussac.\n\nHe was married for many years to the Belgian opera star Fanny Heldy. They are buried together in the Cimetière de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.\n\nOn his passing in 1980, Boussac's estate was liquidated and \"L'Aurore\" sold to Robert Hersant who merged it with his \"Le Figaro\" newspaper. The property itself would eventually be acquired by Stavros Niarchos. The Aga Khan IV had purchased the bulk of the Boussac farm's breeding stock in 1978 when Boussac's companies were declared bankrupt.\n\nIn his honor, the Prix Marcel Boussac, a Group One Stakes Race, is run annually at the Longchamp Racecourse.\n\n"}

He was selected by the Braves in the first round (4th pick) of the 1984 June amateur draft (secondary phase) and made his major league debut on July 5, 1987. \nBlauser was a powerful right-handed shortstop at 6' 0\", 170 lb. He hit well for a middle infielder but was shaky with the glove, which often led him to be replaced on the field in the later innings.

He subsequently moved to Western Europe and obtained a Ph.D. degree from the University of Geneva. In 1913, he joined a group of Georgian patriots in the Committee of Independent Georgia, and engaged in journalism, co-editing with his brother Georges Keresselidze a Geneva-based Georgian newspaper \"Tavisupali Sakartvelo\" (“Free Georgia”) from 1913 to 1914, and then working for a Berlin-based \"Kartuli Gazeti\" (“Georgian Newspaper”) from 1916 to 1918. In 1914, at the eve of World War I, the Committee moved to Germany and sought the German aid in restoring the independence of Georgia from Russia. Keresselidze led a military unit of Georgian volunteers, the Georgian Legion, which fought on the German side and was transferred to the Ottoman-Russian Caucasus front. Keresselidze tried to negotiate an alliance with the Ottoman Empire, but refused to accept its suzerainty over a potentially independent Georgia. He was subsequently promoted to major general, but the Legion was disbanded due to his disagreement with the Ottoman government. Keresselidze was then involved in diplomacy between Georgians and Germans, and staging subversions against the Russian troops. After the collapse of the Russian armies in the Caucasus and the proclamation of Georgian independence in May 1918, Keresselidze was able to his own country and helped create national army divisions. The 1921 Red Army invasion of Georgia forced him into exile to Germany where he was among the founding members and a secretary general of the right-leaning nationalist organization Tetri Giorgi. Not long before his death, he helped establish a new political organization of Georgian émigrés, the Union of Georgian Traditionalists.\n\nKeresselidze's revolutionary career is the subject of a fictionalized biography \"Unending Battle\" (London, 1934) by the British army officer and writer Harold Courtenay Armstrong (1891–1943).\n"}

He suffered a serious knee injury on his international debut in March 2004, and retired in 2009 having failed to fully recover.\n\nSince retiring from playing, Kennedy has worked as a scout and a coach for Celtic . In February 2019 he was appointed assistant manager of the club.\n\nKennedy is the maternal grandson of Celtic and Manchester United forward Jimmy Delaney and nephew of Motherwell defender Pat Delaney, but he is not related to the Northern Irish footballer John Kennedy, a midfielder who played for Celtic in the 1960s.\n\nHe came through Celtic's youth system and signed his first professional contract on the same day as fellow defender Stephen McManus. He made his first-team debut aged 16 during the 1999–00 season. Kennedy was the youngest Celtic player to be called up to the first team squad and then the youngest debutant. He played in the U18 team in 2000–01, and lost the Scottish Youth Cup final to Aberdeen. In the 2003–04 season, he had a run in the Celtic starting eleven and came under scrutiny from scouts of AC Milan who contacted Celtic about making a move. It was during this season that Kennedy scored his only goal for Celtic, against Dundee in the SPL.\n\nKennedy received high praise for his performance in a 0–0 draw with Barcelona in a UEFA Cup last-16 clash at the Camp Nou in March 2004. \nWithin weeks he was given his international debut, but was seriously injured by a dangerous tackle during that match. Kennedy required several operations by Richard Steadman before he could even attempt a comeback. Following his injury, the SFA compensated Celtic with respect to Kennedy's wages, as it had been suffered while he was playing in an international match. Before his injury, Kennedy made enough appearances to qualify for a title medal and played twice in the Scottish Cup win that season.\n\nKennedy finally resumed training in late 2006, and was an unused substitute for Celtic's Champions League match against A.C. Milan on 20 February 2007. He played his first competitive match since the injury on 22 April 2007, when Celtic clinched the SPL championship by winning 2–1 against Kilmarnock. Four days later, on 26 April, Kennedy signed a new three-year contract with the club.\n\nKennedy made further appearances for Celtic over the next several months, but during a Champions League match against Shakhtar Donetsk on 28 November 2007, he was stretchered off after he twisted his knee on landing from an aerial challenge. The initial diagnosis was that he sustained damage to his lateral meniscus and the posterior lateral complex of the same knee he had previously injured, ruling him out for three months. This match proved to be Kennedy's final appearance for Celtic.\n\nOn 14 July 2008, BBC Sport reported that Kennedy had joined Motherwell on a six-month loan deal, but this report was denied by Celtic later that day. Kennedy did, however, meet up with the Motherwell squad in Austria, on trial. Soon afterwards Kennedy joined Norwich City on loan until January 2009. He made his Norwich debut in a 2–0 defeat to Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena on 9 August 2008. Kennedy's performances for Norwich were impressive, and he scored in games with Derby County and Preston North End.\n\nKennedy suffered ankle ligament damage during his time at Norwich, and he returned to Celtic after further damaging his troubled knee in December 2008. On 13 November 2009, it was announced that, at the age of just 26, Kennedy had retired from football on medical grounds.\n\nHe was awarded a Special Recognition award at Celtic FC end of season awards in 2010.\n\nKennedy played in both legs of the play-off defeat to Croatia U21s to qualify for the Under-21 Euros in 2003. He was the only remaining regular fit Scotland U21 central defender going in to the second leg. His only goal at under-21 level came from a Michael Stewart set piece in a 2–1 against Israel U21s in 2002.\n\nFollowing fine performances for Celtic, Kennedy was called up to the Scotland squad for a friendly against Romania on 31 March 2004, and was selected to start the match. After 14 minutes, Kennedy sustained a serious injury to his leg after a late challenge by Ionel Ganea, which eventually ruled him out of action for almost three years.\n\nOfficial caps and goals\n\nA testimonial fixture for Kennedy between Scotland and Celtic was discussed, while a match between Finn Harps and Celtic had been arranged for 28 November 2010, but was postponed. The game was then played on Sunday 6 March, with Celtic winning 4–1. A further testimonial match was arranged for Sunday 22 May 2011 at Celtic Park between Celtic and some of the Celtic team that reached the 2003 UEFA Cup Final, including then manager Martin O'Neill. This match was also postponed, and eventually replaced with a match between a team of Celtic Legends, managed by Martin O'Neill, and a team of Manchester United Legends. The match was played on 9 August 2011 with Celtic winning 5–2, and the proceeds were donated to Oxfam's East Africa charity appeal.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Kennedy became a first team scout for Celtic in 2010, working in this capacity for the club until 2011, travelling around Europe to help find new players for the club.\n\nKennedy gained coaching qualifications and worked as a coach with the club's U19 squad in season 2011–12, and the Development Squad (reserve team) from 2012 to 2014. He lead the Celtic youth team to a league an cup double in 2011–12 and 2012–13 and a third straight title in 2013–14. Kennedy also oversaw the Under-19 team compete in the NextGen Series in 2011–12, a pan-European competition for youth teams.\n\nHe became first team coach in 2014 after the appointment of Ronny Deila as manager, winning the Scottish league championship in each of Deila's two seasons in charge, as well as the Scottish League Cup in 2014–15. He continued in the role under Brendan Rodgers from 2016, and Celtic won domestic trebles in both 2016–17 and 2017–18. In February 2019, Kennedy was promoted to assistant manager when Neil Lennon replaced Rodgers as manager.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Kennedy joined the board of Directors of the UK based charity Football Aid.

Sy Barry attended high school at the School of Industrial Art in Manhattan, New York City beginning in 1943. His first freelance job was working on the comic book \"Famous Funnies\".

He was hired by Capp Studio to draw \"Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story\", a comics pamphlet published in 1957. Barry's signature was visible on the cover of the pamphlet's first edition, but a text box covered it in later printings. \"The Montgomery Story\", written by Alfred Hassler and Benton Resnik and distributed by the Fellowship of Reconciliation, \"taught young people not just about the event itself but also about nonviolence as a tool for social change.\" Many decades later, the comic inspired the \"March\" trilogy by Georgia Congressman John Lewis.\n\nIn 1961, upon the death of \"The Phantom\" artist Wilson McCoy, who had succeeded creator Lee Falk and subsequent artist Ray Moore, King Features hired Barry to take over that strip. Barry remained on it for more than 30 years until his retirement in 1995. Barry frequently used pencil artists on the strip, working primarily as an inker, though he often drew entire stories when time permitted.

It was written by the band's lead guitarist Noel Gallagher, and was released as the lead single from their fifth studio album, \"Heathen Chemistry\" (2002) on 15 April 2002.\n\nThe song peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart becoming the band's sixth number-one single in their native country, remaining on top for one week before being dislodged by the Sugababes' \"Freak Like Me\". The song also topped the charts in Canada, Italy and Scotland, and reached the top 10 in Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway and Spain.\n\nThe song, which combines powerful rock with a psychedelic feel, was unveiled during Oasis' Autumn 2001 \"Noise and Confusion\" Tour. The song was due to be released commercially at the same time but Noel decided the track needed more work done on it to be suitable for release. Many have commented on the main guitar riff being lifted from the Stereophonics song, \"Same Size Feet\", which uses exactly the same, or at least very similar, guitar riff. The B-side, \"Just Getting Older\", was written at the time of the release of \"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\" (2000). The second B-side, \"Idler's Dream\", is the only Oasis song to not feature any guitars and is one of the three, the others being Married With Children and Sad Song, to not feature drums; the song consists simply of Noel Gallagher's vocals and a piano accompaniment.\n\nThe title has little to do with the lyrics of the song, which are more in the vein of \"Definitely Maybe\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\". Noel got the name \"The Hindu Times\" from a T-shirt he saw in a charity shop. It has been speculated that the title refers to the main riff's similarity to Indian music in sound, sounding as if it were played on a sitar. Gallagher himself says that it is because he had already named the song before any lyrics were written for it.\n\"The Hindu Times\" was one of the first Oasis singles since the singles from \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" (1995) to receive almost unanimously positive reviews from critics. In 2008 \"NME\" listed the song as one of the greatest indie anthems of the 2000s. In October 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 143 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".

Written by Jörgen Elofsson and produced by Elofsson himself, Per Magnusson and David Kreuger, the song was released as Spears' second single on April 30, 1999 by Jive Records. \"Sometimes\" is a teen pop song that is influenced by bubblegum pop, and alludes to a relationship where a shy girl is reserved on expressing feelings to her lover. The song received generally mixed to positive reviews from contemporary critics.\n\n\"Sometimes\" attained worldwide success, peaking inside the top ten in eleven countries. In the United States, the song peaked at number twenty one. The song reached number one in Belgium (Flanders), Netherlands and New Zealand, while reaching number two in Australia. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number three, and is also Spears' third best-selling single in the country. An accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick, was shot at the Paradise Cove in Malibu, California. It portrays Spears watching her love interest from afar. Spears has performed \"Sometimes\" in four of her concert tours, including at the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999), the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000–01), and the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001–02).\n\nBefore recording her debut album, Spears had originally envisioned it in the style of \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger [and] more adult contemporary\". However, the singer agreed with her label's appointment of producers, who had the objective to reach a teen public at the time. She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded the spring of 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. \"Sometimes\" was written by Jörgen Elofsson, and produced by Per Magnusson and David Kreuger. Spears recorded the vocals for the song in May 1998, at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. It was also mixed at Cheiron Studios by Martin. Esbjörn Öhrwall played the acoustic guitar, while bass guitar was done by Thomas Lindberg. Keyboards and programming was done by Kreuger, and additional keyboards by Magnusson. Background vocals were provided by Anders von Hoffsten. Spears also co-wrote and recorded a track called \"I'm So Curious\", produced by Eric Foster White, that was released as a B-side to \"Sometimes\". The track was recorded in 1997 at 4MW East Studios in New Jersey. \"Sometimes\" was released as the second single from \"...Baby One More Time\" on April 30, 1999.\n\nThe song created controversy over the writing credits. Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote \"Sometimes\" in 1990, but did not copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, \"I now know for a fact that you wrote ['Sometimes']. But there's nothing I can do about it. That's all I can say about it.\" The e-mail was considered fake and the lawsuit was dismissed on October 31, 2005, when Judge John D. Tinder claimed the singer did not steal the song.\n\n\"Sometimes\" is a romantic teen pop song that is influenced by bubblegum pop, with a length of four minutes and four seconds. The song is composed in the key of B major and is set in time signature of common time with a moderately slow tempo of 96 beats per minute. After the bridge, it transposes to B major. Spears' vocal range spans almost two octaves from the low note F to the high note E. The song has a sequence of Cm–Fsus–B–B(9)/D–F/A–F as its chord progression. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted \"Sometimes\" has \"a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm.\"\n\nLyrically, the song is a \"heartbroken ballad\", where Spears declares on the introduction, \"You tell me you're in love with me / That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me / It's not that I don't wanna stay / But every time you come too close I move away\". According to musicologist Melanie Lowe, \"Spears shows a different side of her personality [with 'Sometimes'] than she does in her other songs.\" Both of them also commented the song \"lacks rhythmic drive and the backing track is fuller, with smoother and rounder synthsized instruments\", while describing Spears' vocals as more natural when compared to \"...Baby One More Time\" and \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\".\n\nA reviewer from CD Universe commented that the song \"warns a potential love of [Spears'] need for time and patience, rolling along nicely with a slow groove and a big beat\". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic considered \"Sometimes\" a competent single, but claimed the song as unremarkable. Kyle Anderson of MTV said that the song \"introduces the first sorta-ballad to [\"...Baby One More Time\"]\", and considered it \"reasonable enough, though through three songs, Spears' lyric approach appears to be entirely about guys. Like, she never stops thinking about them\". Caryn Ganz of \"Rolling Stone\" called \"Sometimes\" a \"further hit\" from \"...Baby One More Time\", along with \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" and \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\". Spence D. of IGN considered \"Sometimes\" a \"[Max Martin] glossy grown-up pop\" song, while Annabel Leathes of BBC Online said the song \"represents the innocent years when Britney annoyed and titillated in equal measure\". \n\nNicholas Hautman, from \"Us Weekly\", deemed it \"the epitome of bubblegum pop, a genre that unjustly got a bad rap. Its key change is what dreams are made of\". \"Bustle\"s Alex Kristelis called it \"a perfect example of \"good\" cheese\". While reviewing \"...Baby One More Time\" on its 20th anniversary, \"Billboard\"s Chuck Arnold felt that \"there is a wistful melancholy to this diary entry of a song that digs deeper into the doubts and insecurities below the bubbly surface of both 'Crazy' and the title track\". The staff from \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed it at number 22 on their ranking of Spears's songs and said that \"not quite a ballad, not yet a banger, ['Sometimes'] cemented Britney as pop’s good girl of '99\". For Daniel Megarry from \"Gay Times\", it was one of the \"standout tracks\" from \"...Baby One More Time\" and wrote that \"it’s impossible not to feel nostalgia when the summery strings of 'Sometimes' grace your eardrums\". Nayer Nissim, from \"Pink News\", deemed it one of Spears' \"more adult (but not adult) early tracks that drips with ‘90s singer-songwritery charm\". Shannon Barbour from \"Cosmopolitan\" opined that it was \"cool, but mostly forgettable\". During the 2000 BMI Pop Awards, \"Sometimes\" was honored with the award of Most Performed BMI Song. In 2017, ShortList's Dave Fawbert listed the song as containing \"one of the greatest key changes in music history\".\n\n\"Sometimes\" achieved commercial success worldwide. The song reached number one in Belgium (Flanders), Netherlands and New Zealand, and was certified Gold in the latter by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), for selling more than 7,500 physical units of the single. It also peaked at number two in Australia, where it was later certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), after shipping over 70,000 units, and number four in Finland and Sweden, while reaching the top ten on other five music charts. \"Sometimes\" was also successful in the United Kingdom. It entered and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart on June 26, 1999. According to The Official Charts Company, \"Sometimes\" is Spears' third best-selling single in the United Kingdom, with sales over 456,000 physical units. In the United States, the song peaked at number 21 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the week of July 24, 1999, while reaching number 11 on the Adult Contemporary and number 29 on the Adult Pop Songs charts. Even though the song enjoyed heavy airplay, it was not available physically to spur album sales. It also managed to peak at number six on Pop Songs. \"Sometimes\" was also certified Silver by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), for sales over 125,000 units of the single in France, where it peaked at number 13.\n\nSpears started rehearsing for the music video for \"Sometimes\" in February 1999. However, during the rehearsals, the singer injured her knee and was forced to start sessions of physical therapy. A month later, Spears released in a statement: \"I want to thank my wonderful fans and all of the people who have offered their love and support during this time,\" while revealing she wouldn't be able to shoot the music video until April 1999. The music video was later directed by Nigel Dick, who also directed her previous video for Spears' 1998 debut single \"...Baby One More Time\". It was shot at the Paradise Cove in Malibu, California. The music video was released on May 6, 1999 on \"Total Request Live\".\n\nAccording to MTV, the initial concept for the music video was to portray Spears on the porch of a beachfront home watching a group of kids having fun, prompting flashbacks about her former boyfriend. However, the video begins with Spears, in a long sleeveless white dress, walking barefoot through a lawn to a telescope, and looking through it. The concept was later changed to a man and a dog walking on the beach, portraying the singer as the girl next door, watching her love interest, played by model Chad Cole, from afar. The beach location was kept, and the music video intercuts with scenes of Spears' dancing on the Paradise Cove pier with her dancers dressed all in beach-friendly white attire, then Spears sits near a car. A writer of \"Rolling Stone\" noted the video is best known for \"purifying the sexy persona Spears introduced in the '... Baby One More Time' video\", while describing it as \"a virginal Britney in a long, flowing white dress (and other demure outfits) gazing at a clean-cut boy on the beach, then she walks on the balcony with a pink ball and does some chaste choreography that features her dancers forming a heart while she sings that she only wants to \"hold you tight, treat you right.\" Spears is sitting on a picnic blanket wishing she was there with him. She leaves alone.\" On February 20, 2012, behind the scenes footage of the music video leaked online.\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits for \"Sometimes\" and \"I'm So Curious\" are taken from the single's liner notes.\n\n"}

For the most part, the user's task is to drive the train and adhere to a very exacting timetable, including stopping at stations to within as little as 30 cm of a prescribed stopping point, ideally within half a second of the scheduled arrival time. While the specifics vary slightly between versions, generally speaking along the way, the user is expected to obey speed limits and other posted signs, sound a warning for work parties along the track, arrive at between-station waypoints on time, and perform similar tasks.\n\n\"Densha de Go\" varies from the \"Train Simulator series\" from Ongakukan primarily in that while the Ongakukan series uses video taken from cameras mounted to the front of real-world trains for its graphics, \"Densha de Go\" titles rely upon computer-drawn graphics.\n\nThe last major title in the series, \"Densha de Go Final!\" was so named to signal that this was to be the last in the series. While still popular in an absolute numbers sense, the series had lost the novelty of its heyday while development costs for individual titles continued to climb due to the detailed virtual worlds that needed to be created.\n\nHowever, Taito and Ongakukan have subsequently released a few co-produced titles for PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, and iOS with the title \"Railfan\". Taito also divided the four routes in \"Densha de Go! Final\" into separate titles and released them on the PSP system.\n\nIn April 2010, 5 years after Square Enix acquired Taito Corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary, \"Densha de Go! Special Version -- Revived! Showa Yamanote Line\" was announced for the Nintendo DS on July 22, 2010. This was a departure from the traditional publisher and distributor of \"Densha de Go\", Taito. \"Densha de Go! Special Version—Revived! Showa Yamanote Line\" offers a variety of trains to control, from the early Yamanote Line up through the current rolling stock. Exclusive to the Nintendo DS, reportedly the controls are completely stylus driven, unlike the variety of custom controls offered in non-handheld versions.\n\nOn June 2011 a version of the game also covering the Yamanote line was released for Apple's iOS (only available in the Japanese App Store). There is the option of using a simulated \"master controller\" on the screen or using touchscreen buttons to move the lever up and down.\n\nUnbalance, who had long supported the franchise by publishing ports of each title to the Windows platform in Japan for over a decade, discontinued the last of its released Densha de Go! titles from retail as of August 2011. The company had been steadily discontinuing titles beginning with the \"1480¥ Series\", so-called due to their price point and comprised the earliest titles, in late 2010/early 2011 as supplies depleted. Later-released titles in the series—the \"1980¥ Series\"—were the last to be discontinued as of August, 2011. A line of custom USB controllers for the series had been discontinued even earlier and now command a large premium on sites such as Yahoo! Auctions Japan. Support through Windows 7 compatibility guides, FAQs and patches remains available through the Unbalance site, however.\n\nIn 2017 Taito, which is owned by Square Enix, released a new arcade cabinet in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the game series. According to an article from Geek: \"The cabinet includes four displays, three of which act as windows showing the track and simulated outside world, whereas the fourth forms the dashboard the player sits at. All the buttons from a real train are present, as are the two physical controls required to make the train move.\" They also released a new mobile game for Android and iOS in Winter 2016.\n\nA large number of hardware train controllers were available for a number of platforms (PC, PS, PS2, Saturn, Wii, etc.) for which \"Densha de Go\" was available. This included versions that had buttons, levers, and pedals to suggest real-world train controllers, including traditional brake-and-throttle train controllers, \"mascon\"-type controllers (single lever for throttle and brake), shinkansen controllers, and tram controllers (ostensibly similar to the traditional brake-and-throttle style, but with different styling).\n\nOne of the most extravagant controllers for the \"Densha de Go!\" series was the Shinkansen Controller, which was released with the \"Densha de Go! Shinkansen EX\" game for both the Wii and PS2. The Shinkansen Controller for the PS2 comes with a LED screen display of speed and controls and a foot pedal to blow the horn, whereas the Shinkansen Controller for the Wii lacked these features, replacing the LED screen with a representative sticker. The Wii version of this controller commands much higher prices than the PS2 version only by virtue of relative rarity.\n\nThe Type 2 Controller is compatible with most titles. The Type 2 Controller reportedly works with \"Railfan\" by connecting its USB lead into the PlayStation 3. \n\nOther versions:\n\n\nA doujin manga and game series, \"Densha de D\", is a parody crossover of the series in combination with the auto racing-based franchise \"Initial D\"; it is popularly associated with a meme regarding \"multi-track drifting\".\n\n"}

The B.A.A.G. was officially classified in the British Army's order of battle as an MI9 unit that was responsible for assisting prisoners of war to escape from the Japanese Army's POW camps.\n\nAfter the Battle of Hong Kong, Lt. Colonel Sir Lindsay Ride, who was then a professor of Physiology at The University of Hong Kong, was captured. Before the end of the battle, he had been the commander of the Hong Kong Voluntary Defence Corps (H.K.V.D.C.) Field Ambulance, and, once hostilities commenced, was given command of the Combined Field Ambulance. Shortly after being captured, Ride escaped from Sham Shui Po POW camp to China with three trusted men. There, in order to further the war effort, support the Chinese, and shore up damaged British prestige in the area, he suggested forming a group that became known as the British Army Aid Group.\n\nThe officers of the B.A.A.G. were mainly European men with a Hong Kong connection, and the operative agents were mostly local Hong Kong men and women who offered their services, often at great risk, in occupied Hong Kong and outside, in the fight for the restoration of their home and freedom. Throughout the war the B.A.A.G. sent agents to gather intelligence – military, political and economic – about conditions in both Hong Kong and southern China. These agents also facilitated many of the POWs' escapes from Hong Kong to the Allied Command Headquarters in Chungking, China's war-time capital. Escaped POWs were then debriefed by B.A.A.G. staff and subsequently rejoined the war effort. The B.A.A.G. also gave medical and humanitarian assistance to civilians and military alike. \n\nThe various roles played by the B.A.A.G. during the war and following the end of the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in August 1945 were summed up in an editorial published in The South China Morning Post in early 1946:\nAt the close of the year, Colonel L.T. Ride said good-bye to the men and women who have worked under him, in the British Army Aid Group, and this leave-taking marked the official end of an organisation that Hong Kong cannot allow to die. Tired memories still recall the desolation that overwhelmed us at the surrender. Then, recovering, for a time we toughened again, sure that the Allies would return very soon. Then hopelessness again, lapsing into despair. We came to regard ourselves a little bitterly as the forgotten folk—until we learned of the B.A.A.G. and the British Consul at Macao. There, miraculously, were friends, rallying round, beckoning us, assuring, us, impatient at times, no doubt, at the slowness of our response, venturing dangerously close, planning, providing, infiltrating at much risk—a resurgence and a rescue service almost without parallel. We did not know them then as the B.A.A.G. It was sufficient to know that Hong Kong men were on the perimeter, that we had not been abandoned at all: and thousands who were able to get away have full cause for gratitude to the B.A.A.G. for ready, generous and efficient help.\n\nThe work done by the B.A.A.G. was very varied, ranging from espionage organisation, and other contact-making, to the assistance of refugees and displaced persons, conveyance of news to anxious relatives and friends, and even including “scorched earth” service when the enemy invaded the interior bases. The B.A.A.G. was so well organised and so well served that the knowledge abroad of conditions in Hong Kong was remarkably accurate and up-to-date. Though in conventional sense not a combat unit, its work, in the advanced sections, was highly dangerous. It is known now that many of its messengers and its agents in Hong Kong were caught and savagely put to torture and death. Their names will live in our minds and hearts; and when the full story of the B.A.A.G. is written its roll of honour will be a tablet to treasure. In its leader the Hong Kong unit was fortunate. Able, familiar with the Colony, and blessed with personality. Colonel Ride was a most appropriate choice. He is also well qualified to be the official historian, and his book will be awaited with keenest interest.\n\nTo this Colony the essential virtue of our part of the B.A.A.G. is that it was Hong Kong. There is rivalry between interned and non-interned as to which section was the custodian of the Hong Kong spiritual relics. If there were during the occupation two Kong Kongs marooned here, there was a third Hong Kong outside—another Hong Kong fretting, worrying and grieving. Nor did its work cease abruptly with the war’s end: for four months the personnel have been here helping to mop up the post-war problems, dealing sympathetically with a host of domestic wants and participating in the avenging of unnecessary sufferings. The unit’s record of service is one for Hong Kong’s pride as well as its gratitude. There is another aspect which should not be overlooked. It is an old taunt that Kong Kong is not China and knows little of China. The Hong Kong folk who escaped, and those who returned from elsewhere to work with the B.A.A.G., have in appreciable degree removed that blemish. They now know China. They laboured in close association with the real Chinese, reaching understanding. They return as an embassy, and they have a further service to perform in educating Hong Kong to a more co-operative conception of things Chinese. It will be a great pity if the B.A.A.G. should be completely dispersed: it has earned its shrine of remembrance and there is still work that it could do.\n\n\n\n \n"}

The album has been acclaimed as Gabriel's artistic breakthrough as a solo artist and for establishing him as one of rock's most ambitious and innovative musicians. Gabriel also explored more overtly political material with two of his most famous singles, the anti-war song \"Games Without Frontiers\" (which became a No. 4 hit and remains his joint highest charting single in the UK) and the anti-apartheid protest song \"Biko\", which remembered the murdered activist Steve Biko. The album was remastered, along with most of Gabriel's catalogue, in 2002.\n\nIn the U.S., the album was titled Peter Gabriel III. The album is also often referred to as Melt owing to its cover photograph by Hipgnosis. Music streaming services currently refer to it as Peter Gabriel 3: Melt.\n\nGabriel's ex-bandmate Phil Collins, who succeeded him as Genesis's lead vocalist, played drums on several of the album's tracks. \"Intruder\" has been cited as the first use of Collins' \"gated drum\" sound. This effect, as created by Steve Lillywhite, Collins and Hugh Padgham, was featured on Collins' and Genesis's recordings throughout the 1980s. The distinctive sound was identified via experiments by Lillywhite, Collins and Padgham, in response to Gabriel's request that Collins and Jerry Marotta not use cymbals on the album's sessions.\n\n\"Artists given complete freedom die a horrible death,\" Gabriel explained to Mark Blake. \"So, when you tell them what they can't do, they get creative and say, 'Oh yes I can,' which is why I banned cymbals. Phil was cool about it. [Marotta] did object and it took him a while to settle in. It's like being right-handed and having to learn to write with your left.\"\n\nSo significant and influential was the sound that it has been claimed by Gabriel, Padgham, Collins, and Lillywhite. It was cited by Public Image Ltd as an influence on the sound of their album \"The Flowers of Romance,\" whose engineer, Nick Launay, was in turn employed by Collins to assist with his solo debut, \"Face Value\". Paul Weller, who was recording with his band the Jam in a nearby studio, contributed guitar to \"And Through the Wire\". Gabriel believed Weller's intense guitar style was ideal for the track.\n\nThe album, produced by Gabriel and Lillywhite, was Gabriel's first and only release for Mercury Records in the United States, after being rejected by Atlantic Records, who handled U.S. distribution for Gabriel's first two solo albums and his last two albums with Genesis. Upon hearing mixes of session tapes in early 1980, Atlantic A&R executive John Kalodner deemed the album not commercial enough for release, and recommended Atlantic drop Gabriel from their roster.\n\n\"Atlantic Records didn't want to put it out at all,\" Gabriel told Mark Blake. \"Ahmet Ertegun said, 'What do people in America care about this guy in South Africa?' and 'Has Peter been in a mental hospital?' because there was this very weird track called 'Lead a Normal Life'. They thought I'd had a breakdown and recorded a piece of crap ... I thought I'd really found myself on that record, and then someone just squashes it. I went through some primordial rejection issues.\"\n\nBy the time the album was released by Mercury several months later, Kalodner – now working for the newly formed Geffen Records label and having realised his mistake – arranged for Geffen to pursue Gabriel as one of their first artist signings. Geffen (at the time distributed by Atlantic sister label Warner Bros. Records) reissued the album in 1983, after Mercury's rights to it lapsed, and marketed it in the United States until 2010, when Gabriel's back catalogue was reissued independently by Real World Records. (Coincidentally, Mercury is now a sister label to Geffen after Mercury's parent PolyGram merged with Geffen's parent Universal Music Group in 1999.)\n\n\"I Don't Remember\" was performed on Gabriel's 1978 tour for his second album. An earlier studio version was to be the A-side of the first 7\" single released in advance of the album by Charisma in Europe and Japan, but a Charisma executive thought Robert Fripp's guitar solos were not radio-friendly. This earlier version wound up as the B-side of the advance \"Games Without Frontiers\" single instead in those territories. It was included on the B-sides and rarities comp, Flotsam And Jetsam, released in 2019. The album version of this song appeared as the A-side of a 12\" single in the United States and Canada.\n\nGabriel jokingly summarised the album's themes as \"The history of a decaying mind\". He added: \"State of mind was definitely an area of interest at the time of writing it, but I never really set out with a concept. It was merely different songs, which perhaps have fitted into one particular slant.\" Of \"No Self Control\", he said: \"That's something which I've observed in myself and in other people… In a state of depression, you have to turn on the radio, or switch on the television, go to the fridge and eat, and sleeping is difficult.\"\n\n\nThe photo was taken with a Polaroid SX-70 instant camera. The sleeve's designer Storm Thorgerson said: \"Peter himself joined with us at Hipgnosis in disfiguring himself by manipulating Polaroids as they 'developed' ... Peter impressed us greatly with his ability to appear in an unflattering way, preferring the theatrical or artistic to the cosmetic.\"\n\nIn 1989, the album was ranked No. 45 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Albums of the 80's\".\n\nIn 2000, \"Q\" magazine placed the album at No. 53 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.\n\nIn 2006, Q placed the album at No. 29 in its list of \"40 Best Albums of the '80s\", the only Gabriel album to make the top 40.\n\n\"Ein deutsches Album\" (English: \"A German Album\"), released in July 1980, is a German-language version of \"Peter Gabriel\". Gabriel sang German vocals on top of completely new recorded instrumental and backing vocal tracks. The German lyrics are translations from the English. Two years later, Gabriel released \"Deutsches Album\" (1982), a significantly altered version of his fourth album \"Peter Gabriel\" (1982) (known as \"Security\" in the United States and Canada). In February 1980, German-language versions of \"Games Without Frontiers\" and \"Here Comes the Flood\" were released as a single in Germany. German adaptation was done by H. Konigstein.\n\nAll songs written by Peter Gabriel. \"Texte\" (that is, lyrics) by Peter Gabriel and .\n\n\n"}

Before its privatisation in the 1990s it was formally the Royal Naval Dockyard Rosyth. Its primary role is now the dismantling of decommissioned nuclear submarines. It is also the integration site for the Royal Navy's newest aircraft carriers, the .\n\nConstruction of the dockyard by civil engineers Easton, Gibb & Son commenced in 1909. At the time, the Royal Navy was strengthening its presence along the eastern seaboard of Great Britain due to a naval arms race with Germany.\n\nIn 1903 approval was given with an estimated cost of £3 million for \"works\" and £250,000 for machinery spread over 10 years. The site consisted of of land, of foreshore, and the main basin would be . This was intended to be large enough for 11 battleships or 22 if doubled up. \n\nThe yard gained in size and importance during the First World War, with a Metropolitan Police division set up to patrol it on 1 January 1916 (the Metropolitan Police then provided ). The first ship to dry dock at Rosyth was the pre-dreadnought battleship on 28 March 1916.\n\n\nBabcock Thorn, a consortium operated by Babcock International and Thorn EMI, was awarded the management contract for Rosyth dockyard in 1987; with Rosyth Dockyard becoming a government owned, contractor run facility. This contract was awarded in parallel with Devonport Management Limited's contract to run Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth. In 1993 the Ministry of Defence announced plans to privatise Rosyth. Babcock International, who had bought out Thorn's share of the original Babcock Thorn consortium, was the only company to submit a bid and after protracted negotiations purchased the yard in January 1997.\n\nIn 1984 Rosyth was chosen as the sole location for refitting the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine fleet (a role it was already specialising in), and in 1986 extensive rebuilding commenced to facilitate this new role. However, in 1993, the government switched the refitting role to Devonport Dockyard.\n\nSeven nuclear submarines were stored at Rosyth in 2007. In 2018, the Public Accounts Committee criticised the slow rate of decommissioning of these submarines, with the Ministry of Defence admitting that it had put off decommissioning due to the cost.\n\nThe Royal Navy's two carriers were constructed across six UK shipyards, with final assembly at Rosyth.\n\nThe admiral-superintendent was the Royal Navy officer in command of a larger Naval Dockyard. The appointment of admiral-superintendents (or their junior equivalents) dates from 1832 when the Admiralty took charge of the Royal Dockyards. Prior to this larger dockyards were overseen by a commissioner who represented the Navy Board. \n\nIncluded:\"\n\nIn the Royal Naval Dockyards, admiral-superintendents ceased to be appointed after 15 September 1971, and existing post-holders were renamed port admirals.\n\nNote: These officers reported to the Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\n"}

The lyrics were written circa 1870 by roommates Archibald Croswell Weeks (Class of 1872), and Wilmot Moses Smith (Class of 1874), and set to the tune of \"Annie Lisle\", a popular 1857 ballad by H. S. Thompson about a heroine dying of tuberculosis.\n\nThis song is one of the better-known alma maters in the United States. It is the only alma mater song included in Ronald Herder's \"500 Best-Loved Song Lyrics\". In a novel, Betty Smith called it \"the saddest and oldest of all college songs\". Edward Abbey, in \"One Life at a Time, Please,\" mentions a campfire sing in which he contributed \"the first line of the only Ivy League song that occurred to me: 'Far above Cayuga's waters . . ..\n\nThe tune has been used since by dozens of universities, colleges, high schools, and camps worldwide. For example, Professor George Penny of the University of Kansas wrote his school's alma mater by changing a few words from Cornell's song (\"Far above the golden valley...\"). Other colleges and universities that have used the same tune include Michigan State College, University of Wisconsin–La Crosse, the College of William and Mary, the Colorado State University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Florida A&M University, Syracuse University, the University of Missouri, the University of Georgia, the University of Alabama, Indiana University, Wofford College, Ripon College, Birmingham-Southern College, Emory University, University of Akron, Erskine College, Lehigh University, Lewis & Clark College, Moravian College, Xavier University, Acadia University, Salem College, Swarthmore College, Vanderbilt University, Howard Payne University, the American University of Beirut, Lingnan (University) College of China's Sun Yat-sen University, and even the hoax Plainfield Teacher's College. It is the tune of the camp song of Boy Scout Camp Tesomas near Rhinelander, Wisconsin; Boy Scout Camp Napowan in Waushara County, Wisconsin; Camp Minsi in Pocono Summit, Pennsylvania;\nand Camp Becket in the Berkshires.\n\nThe song traditionally concludes campus performances by the Cornell University Chorus and Cornell University Glee Club. It is also heard between the second and third periods of men's ice hockey games, halftime or the end of the third quarter of football games, and half time of other Cornell athletic contests attended by the Cornell Big Red Pep Band. A rendition of the tune is also used to conclude all of the school's daily afternoon chime concerts (evening performances traditionally end with the \"Evening Song\"; the morning concert begins with the \"Jennie McGraw Rag\" but has no traditional finale).\n\nThe first two verses are the best known and are usually the only verses sung. The song, however, has six verses and no refrains. However, in common practice, only the first two verses are sung, and they share the lines \"Lift the chorus, speed it onward, loud her praises tell; / Hail to thee our Alma Mater! Hail, all hail, Cornell!\". Due to this symmetry, whenever only the first two verses are printed or sung, it is customary to consider lines 1–2 and 5–6 as being verses 1 and 2, respectively, and lines 3–4 and 7–8 as being a single repeated refrain:\n\nThe oldest known recording of the song is the Cornell University Glee Club's recording made on January 2, 1914, at the Columbia Phonograph Company on 38th Street in New York City. The record was distributed later that year as a 10-inch 78 RPM recording. The song \"Cornell\" was recorded on the other side.\n\nThe song has been recorded many times since by Cornell's various vocal and instrumental ensembles.\n\nThe song was heard in the 1953 film \"Titanic\", in which it is sung by Robert Wagner and Purdue University students in the RMS \"Titanic\"'s dining room moments before it collides with the iceberg.\n\nIt is the tune of the school song of fictional Anarene High School in the 1971 film \"The Last Picture Show\".\n\nThe song was in Season 2, Episode 8 of Marvel's \"Agent Carter\".\n\nThe song was also sung by the a cappella group Here Comes Treble in Season 9, Episode 5 of The Office and by Andy Bernard in Season 9, Episode 22, during his audition for \"America's Next A Capella Sensation\".\n\nThe tune played as the Alma Mater of Springfield College on the TV show \"Father Knows Best\", season 6, episode 8, \"Margaret's Old Flame\".\n\nThe tune is used in the parting song for the Kellerman Resort in the 1987 film \"Dirty Dancing\".\n\nThe tune is played over the opening credits of the 1942 Merrie Melodies cartoon \"The Dover Boys at Pimento University\".\nThe tune was featured in \"Hey Arnold!\" as the school song of PS-118.\n\nThe tune was used for the Civil War battle song \"Ellsworth's Avengers\" [words by A. Lora Hudson, musical adaptation by S. L. Coe] paying tribute to Col. Elmer Ellsworth, the first Union officer killed in the conflict. He was shotgunned by the innkeeper after removing a confederate flag from the rooftop of an Alexandria, Virginia hotel.\n\n\n"}

Troland, is a unit of \"conventional retinal illuminance\". It is meant as a method for correcting photometric measurements of luminance values impinging on the human eye by scaling them by the effective pupil size. It is equal to retinal illuminance produced by a surface whose luminance is one nit when the apparent area of the entrance pupil of the eye is 1 square millimeter.\n\nThe troland unit was proposed in 1916 by Leonard T. Troland, who called it a photon.\n\nThe troland typically refers to the ordinary or photopic troland, which is defined in terms of the photopic luminance:\n\nwhere \"L\" is the photopic luminance in cd m and \"p\" is pupil area in mm.\n\nA scotopic troland is also sometimes defined:\n\nwhere \"L′\" is the scotopic luminance in cd m and \"p\" is pupil area in mm.\n\nAlthough named \"retinal illuminance\" (and originally named \"photon\" by Troland), trolands do not measure the actual photon flux incident on the retina; that quantity depends on the specific wavelengths of light that constitute the luminance used in the calculation. \n\nTroland does not directly convert to other units, being a retinal luminance per unit area of a pupil.\nHowever Troland is linked to retinal luminance in as follows. Assuming the corneal luminance L from an extended source, the pupil diameter p and the focal length of the eye F, the retinal luminance is:\n\nLr [lm / m^2] = pi * L / 4 / (f/#)^2 ~ pi * L * p^2 / 4 / F^2.\n\nMultiplying by the pupil area : formula_3\n\nAlternatively, the retinal luminance formula_4\n\nAs provided by a more accurate optical calculations, the conversion factor is 278 rather than 289 as demonstrated by simplified considerations above.\n\nSometimes (by convention only, although not rigorously accurate by definition), retinal luminance is expressed in formula_5.

It was intended as a defence against a German invasion, and was part of a national network of similar \"Stop Lines\".\n\nIn June 1940 under the direction of General Edmund Ironside, concentric rings of anti-tank defences and pillboxes were constructed in and around London. They comprised: The London Inner Keep, London Stop Line Inner (Line C), London Stop Line Central (Line B) and London Stop Line Outer (Line A). The Outer London Ring was the strongest and best developed of these, mainly because it could be constructed in open countryside. Work on all the lines was halted weeks later by Ironside's successor, General Alan Brooke, who favoured mobile warfare above static defence.\n\nThe ring used a mixture of natural rivers and artificial ditches up to wide and deep, encircling London completely.\n\nNorth of London the ring followed a path similar to the route now taken by the M25 motorway, from Watford, following the River Colne, through Potters Bar, Cuffley, Nazeing, then running south through Epping Forest, Loughton and Chigwell. \n\nMany pillboxes and anti-tank traps are still visible at points along the ring, but in the majority of places the ditch is no longer visible, covered by the M25 or London suburbs.\n\n\n"}

WKTU is owned by iHeartMedia and broadcasts from studios in the former AT&T Building in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan; its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building.\n\nThe 103.5 frequency first went on the air in 1948 as WNNJ licensed to Paterson, New Jersey. It soon changed its call sign to WPAT-FM, simulcasting WPAT (AM). In 1950, WPAT-FM's Garrett Mountain transmitter was damaged by a tropical storm and due to FM's small listenership in those early days, it was never rebuilt. WPAT-FM went back on the air in 1956 at 93.1 FM.\n\nThe 103.5 frequency was assigned to Babylon, New York as WGLI-FM in 1958, simulcasting sister station WGLI 1290AM. William Reuman the founder and owner of WWRL in New York City was the owner of WGLI. In March 1960, Friendly Frost Inc. (a Long Island-based appliance store chain) acquired WGLI Inc. from Mr. Reuman and his partners. In November 1961 Friendly Frost moved the station from Babylon to Lake Success and the call sign was changed to WTFM. WTFM transmitted with 20 kW from a 200-foot stick outside the studio building visible from the Long Island Expressway. Eventually, the transmitter was relocated to the Chrysler Building, and a major signal boost was accomplished. As WTFM, the station used the slogan \"The International Stereo Sound of New York,\" and played an instrumental-based easy listening format. Initially, it was strictly instrumental versions of pop standards. By 1969, the station began playing soft instrumental versions of rock and roll baby boomer pop songs as well as standards. The station was eventually sold to Sydney Horne and the company became known as WTFM inc. By 1971, the station began playing soft vocalists once every 15 minutes including soft songs by rock artists and standards artists. They kept this format until the fall of 1978, when the old WKTU (on 92.3 FM) went from an adult contemporary format to a disco format. As an easy listening station, WTFM was up against similar stations: WRFM and WPAT AM & FM, that had higher ratings. As a result, in Autumn 1978 the station switched to a soft rock leaning adult contemporary format. Ultimately, ratings continued to remain low with the new format. WTFM was put up for sale in 1980 and Heftel Broadcasting made a proposal to buy the station from Sydney Horne. The plan was to switch WTFM to an album rock format but the sale was never consummated. The station stayed up for sale and had many offers, but none that were acceptable, throughout 1980 and 1981.\n\nIn early 1982, Doubleday bought the station and by April the station call letters were changed to WAPP, however the format would remain the same for a while longer until the new ownership decided what to do with the station. On June 14, the station switched to an Album-oriented rock format similar to WPLJ and WNEW-FM and was renamed \"The Apple 103.5\"; the format began with \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" by The Who. The station went commercial-free for the duration of that summer, and as a result, it became the highest-rated radio station in New York City. After the station added commercials, listeners switched back to WPLJ and WNEW-FM, and so ratings went down. In 1983, when WPLJ switched to a CHR format, the station's ratings got a slight boost.\n\nIn 1983, a then-unknown Jon Bon Jovi visited the station and wrote and sung the jingles for the station. He spoke with DJ Chip Hobart, who suggested Bon Jovi let WAPP include the song \"Runaway\" on the station's compilation album of local homegrown talent. Bon Jovi was reluctant, but eventually gave them the song, on which Bon Jovi had used studio musicians to play on \"Runaway\" (which was written in 1980). WAPP worked with WOR-TV (now WWOR-TV) in nearby Secaucus, NJ on a music video show, \"Rock 9 Videos\", for a short time in 1984. As part of a marketing effort, WAPP-FM launched a contest called \"New York Rocks 1983.\" Local music acts were encouraged to submit demo tapes to this competition. Among the tapes submitted to this contest was \"Runaway\", but didn't win the competition. Another act called the \"Frankie Carr Band\" won the honors. This competition was repeated in 1984.\n\nAs 1984 progressed, WAPP's ratings were on the upswing. However, the station's owners decided to abruptly change the station's format to CHR that October. They felt that if co-owned stations in Washington, D.C. and Minnesota could do well with the format, then this station could as well. This would not be the case, as the station could not compete with WPLJ or Z-100, and their ratings fell. The station quietly segued back in a rock direction with a rock-leaning CHR format in June 1985. The station leaned current based rock while playing a limited amount of rhythmic cuts. Even that would not be able to turn the station's ratings around as FM 92.3, the original WKTU, flipped to rock as K Rock.\n\nIn 1986, Emmis Broadcasting bought WAPP from Doubleday. On August 13, 1986, WAPP began stunting with a classic rock format as \"Classic 103.\"\n\nOn August 15, 1986, at 6 p.m., The Rolling Stones' \"It's All Over Now\" and a bomb noise rang out, marking the end of WAPP. The station then flipped to a CHR/Dance format as \"Hot 103\" with new call letters WQHT. The first song on \"Hot\" was \"R.S.V.P.\" by Five Star. No one in the radio industry expected it, but the new format that would be labeled \"Rhythmic CHR\" was taking shape. WQHT was the second such station with the format, months after Emmis launched it on KPWR in Los Angeles earlier that year.\n\nWQHT's first Program Director was Joel Salkowitz. Steve Ellis, formerly of WAPP, was Music Director. Don Kelly was the consultant for both WQHT and KPWR in those early months.\n\nWQHT played a different variety of music than what was on the New York radio dial at that time. There was no CHR/Dance station in the market since WKTU left the air a year earlier. WQHT came on the air with a new and improved dance-oriented format, which radio trade magazines of the day called a hybrid format. The station mixed in Top 40 hits with Dance and Club music of the day. The station was also known for playing \"hotmixes\" or extended versions of certain songs. The \"hotmixes\" were either just the extended versions available commercially on 12\" singles, or mixes that were created by local club DJs, such as \"Little\" Louie Vega. They also aired regular versions of the songs that had longer intros than that of their competitors. Noel used WQHT's version of his single \"Silent Morning\" for the song's music video, as evidenced in the video's credits. With the debut of WQHT, some record labels such as Atco and Elektra reportedly started to see a spike in 12\" single sales in the New York Metro, as was reported by Billboard Magazine.\n\nWQHT's imaging sounded similar to that of sister station KPWR, as WNAP alums Chuck Riley and Eric Edwards became the official voices of the station. While Chuck mainly voiced bumpers and sweepers, Eric on the other hand mostly voiced promos and specialty liners. These two were also the voices for other Emmis stations at the time such as KPWR, WLOL, and WAVA.\n\nA month after the station's launch, WQHT began adding an airstaff. Some of the first DJs, or \"Hot Jocks\", to join WQHT were Deborah Rath-Howell from KPWR in Los Angeles, Alan \"Al Nouveau\" Bandiero from WKTU, Johnny \"Big John\" Monds from WUSL in Philadelphia, Sonny Joe Fox from KMEL in San Francisco, Frederick \"Fast Freddie\" Colon and Niecie Colon from WBLS, as well as Vanessa Scott, Rufus Hurt, and Mitch Phillips, who were hold overs from WAPP.\n\n\"Broadway\" Bill Lee from KPKE in Denver joined the station around Christmas 1986 as the youngest of the Hot Jocks. With Rick Allen also joined as Production Director, as well being the voice of WQHT's electronic prizedroid Robojock. Allen and TM Communications customize KPWR's \"K-Power!\" jingle package for WQHT under the name of \"The Hot Streak!\" with Chuck on rapping vocals, and would be utilized on other stations. (Allen would go on to fame as the person who created the famous \"From the top of the World Trade Center\" legal ID, also voiced by Chuck.) Because of the success of Allen's production, many radio production directors were impressed by his work and released some of the production elements and music beds used for WQHT into syndication under the brand name \"Continuous Climax.\"\n\nBy 1987, WQHT was making a name for itself by playing Freestyle in regular rotation. Artists such as Noel, Safire, The Cover Girls and TKA were made famous because they were played in heavy rotation right next to Mainstream Top 40 artists such as Exposé, Debbie Gibson and Taylor Dayne. Freestyle and club music from other cities such as Miami, who had (and continues to have) an active dance and club scene, wasn't ignored either. Company B and Tiger Moon, who were famous in the Florida club scene, were played on WQHT as well. In fact, Hot 103 pioneered custom station versions of songs, where the artists would change lyrics and sing about the station. Because of WQHT's success with the genre, WHTZ copied the station's success by adding a few Freestyle titles, as well as Urban Contemporary stations WBLS and WRKS, who were playing long versions of the records they played as well.\n\nThat same year, WQHT added a local weekly countdown show called \"New York's Hot Tracks\", hosted by Bill Lee, which counted down the top 10 selling 12\" singles of the week. The show started on Sunday nights, then moved to Fridays at 6p.m., and then later at 5p.m.. It featured short interview clips and aired sonovox numbers produced by Rick Allen identifying the chart position. \"Hot Tracks\" was produced, for a time, by PD Joel Salkowitz and researched by Angie Martinez, who would later become an afternoon host after the station flipped to Hip-Hop and R&B in 1992. (The show would later be hosted by Jeff Thomas, and was cancelled in 1993.)\n\nIn July 1987, WQHT wanted to devote some airtime to older dance music at the urging of Al Bandiero. Management agreed, and thus began \"The Disco Classics' Showcase\", which would feature dance music older than seven years. The show was broadcast for an hour from 8 p.m.-9 p.m. on Sundays. In 1989, the show was expanded to two hours. Later hosts would be Paco Navarro in 1992 from WKTU fame, and Freddie Colon. The show lasted until 1994.\n\nFrom the time the station signed on the air, it presented a music intensive morning show with only two stopsets of commercials an hour. Mornings were first hosted by Rufus Hurt with news by Judy Hernandez (another hold over from WAPP, where she went by the name Judy Herron). After Hurt left, \"Big John\" Monds began took over for him.\n\nBy the fall of 1987, WQHT was looking for a morning team to round out its dayparts. It settled on the veteran team of \"Walton & Johnson & The Not Ready For Drive Time Players.\" The show didn't click, and was cancelled in a couple months.\n\nIn 1988, the station brought in the married morning team of Ron Stevens and Joy Grdnic from KSHE in St. Louis to handle morning drive. Stevens & Grdnic were unique as they were a male/female team rather than the usual male/male morning show. Veteran newsman J. Paul Emerson of KMEL's Morning Zoo was joined as the wild newsman with a tabloid type delivery. The station added traffic updates via Shadow Traffic and contracted with WNYW meteorologist Nick Gregory to provide live weather updates.\n\nIn February 1987, Billboard Magazine created a new \"Crossover 30\" chart in response to WQHT and the rise in popularity of other CHR/Dance stations. The chart was based solely on airplay from stations that reported to it. Radio trade magazine \"Radio and Records\" created a similar chart and started reporting the weekly music adds by WQHT and others.\n\nThe impact of WQHT inspired Emmis to partner with Westwood One to create a weekly national dance music countdown called \"American Dance Traxx\", which debuted the week of March 23, 1987. The show was groundbreaking as it presented the countdown in long music sweeps as opposed to the traditional 2-songs in a row followed by a commercial break. The 3-hour countdown was hosted by KPWR's Jeffrey Wyatt and produced by WQHT PD Joel Salkowitz. The show used the same music beds that were on WQHT and KPWR and featured short interviews with the artists of the day. The show aired on WQHT Sundays from 9p.m.–midnight. After Jeff left both KPWR and Emmis, Deborah Rath was made the permanent host until former MTV VJ and host of \"Club MTV\" \"Downtown\" Julie Brown took over in 1992.\n\nIn February 1987, the station introduced the \"Hot Night\" concert series. The concerts consisted of the top CHR/Dance artists of the day. Tickets for the concerts were only available to listeners, with the station giving them away. \"Hot Night 1\" was held February 4, 1987 at the Palladium and starred Sheila E. and The Cover Girls. Hot Night 2 was held at the same location, starring The Jets and Debbie Gibson.\n\nAs years went on, \"Hot Night\" got bigger and expanded to more exotic locations such as the Bahamas, on December 13, 1989 with \"Hot Night in Paradise\", featuring Pajama Party, Seduction, Noel, TKA, Young MC, Roxette, Expose and Stevie B., as well as Cancun, Mexico. The last known \"Hot Night\" was in 1993, at the Palladium and starred SWV.\n\nIn June 1987, WQHT debuted \"The Original Saturday Night Dance Party\", live from 4D NightClub in Manhattan from 10p.m.–2a.m., with no commercials and limited interruption. All music from the show was live from the club as WQHT plugged right into the DJ booth mixer. Scotty Blackwell was the first DJ to spin for the show, where he would mix with 4 Technics 1200ML Turntables. There was even a cart machine on hand to play the sweepers over the air.\n\nAs time went on, WQHT was wired into two dozen different clubs around the area, including The Palladium, The Copacabana, Foxes, Emerald City, The Tunnel, Chicago, Limelight, 1018, The L.I. Exchange, and The Roxy.\n\nOther notable club DJs such as Glenn Friscia, DJ Animal, Roman Ricardo, Freddie Bastone and Mojo Nicosia were on the turntables for \"The Saturday Night Dance Party\". Artists such as France Joli, Safire, The Cover Girls and others would occasionally perform live on the radio and in the clubs.\n\nOn September 22, 1988, at 5:30 p.m., WQHT would change frequencies, as Emmis acquired NBC's radio stations. Since Federal Communications Commission regulations at the time required that a company could only own one FM radio station in a market, Emmis sold the 103.5 frequency to Westwood One (which, coincidentally, had also acquired the remnants of the NBC Radio Network). At the same time, they moved the format at 103.5 FM to the 97.1 FM frequency which they acquired from NBC, with WQHT becoming \"Hot 97.\" As a result, WYNY, which was running a country music format at the 97.1 frequency prior to the sale, would move to 103.5 FM.\n\nThe station, now known as \"Country 103.5\", had mediocre ratings in their first few months at its new frequency. Even though rumors of a format change were always existent at the station, the country format remained. In 1993, the station would be sold to Broadcast Partners, whom were committed to keeping Country on WYNY. As a country station, Jim Kerr would be the station's morning show host from 1990 to 1993, while their airstaff included Dan Daniel, Randy Davis, Bill Rock, Ray Rossi, Lisa Taylor, Charlie Berger and Susan Browning.\n\nMeanwhile, WQHT began to move away from Dance music and shifted towards hip hop in 1993. By 1994, they played almost no dance music. After they officially changed to an Urban Contemporary format that year, New Yorkers demanded a Dance music station.\n\nIn the spring of 1995, Broadcast Partners opted to sell the station to Evergreen Media, and after a lot of speculation about the station's future, Evergreen confirmed in January 1996 that the station would be changing formats. On the final weekend that the station would play country music (which would be from February 2 to February 4, 1996), the entire air staff said goodbye. WYNY ended local programming at 6 p.m. on February 4 with \"The Dance\" by Garth Brooks, followed by syndicated programming. After airing the syndicated \"After Midnite with Blair Garner\" show in the early morning hours of February 5 (which also ended with \"The Dance\"), the country music format was gone from the station, thus leaving the entire New York City area without a full-time Country station. (Later that year, country would resurface on several suburban stations, one of which would get the WYNY calls, resurfacing in late 1998.) Beginning at 5:30 a.m. on February 5th, WYNY began stunting by simulcasting sister stations across the country, the first being Rock-formatted WRCX Chicago. On February 6, at 6 a.m., the simulcasting switched to Mainstream Urban-formatted KKBT Los Angeles. On February 7, at 6 a.m., the simulcasting switched to Talk-formatted WLUP-FM Chicago. On February 8, at 6 a.m., the simulcasting switched to AC-formatted KIOI San Francisco. On February 9, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., the simulcast switched to Alternative-leaning Top 40 WXKS-FM Boston. At 6 p.m., the simulcasting of sister stations ended.\n\nNew York City would not have another full-time country station until January 2013, when Cumulus Media launched Nash FM 94.7.\n\nAt 6 p.m. on February 9, 1996, WYNY switched its stunting to a heartbeat sound effect, promoting the launch of a new format coming the following day at Noon. At that time, WKTU was relaunched on 103.5 FM with a dance-based CHR format; WKTU's first song was \"Gonna Make You Sweat\" by C+C Music Factory. The station went to number one in the Arbitron ratings. Drag performer RuPaul co-hosted mornings with Michelle Visage, Lisa Taylor and Freddie Colon around this period, further helping their ratings. Sean \"Hollywood\" Hamilton and Goumba Johnny made their debut at night, and after much success, were moved to mornings in January 1998. By 2002, the moderate amount of rap played on the station was gone and the station evolved into more of a Rhythmic Hot AC.\n\nOn May 31, 2006, WKTU announced that actress/comedian Whoopi Goldberg would become the station's new morning host, and that KTU would serve as the flagship station for her syndicated morning show. Her show, which airs mostly on AC and Rhythmic outlets in the United States, especially those owned by WKTU's now-parent company Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), began on July 31, 2006. The news of Goldberg being named 'KTU's new morning star, and the departures of popular afternoon drive DJ \"Broadway\" Bill Lee and late night hostess Jewelz in June 2006, led to talk that KTU might switch formats (some suspected an upbeat female targeted Hot AC-type direction similar to sister station KBIG/Los Angeles) with Goldberg's arrival. KTU management insisted that there were no plans to flip formats, even with Goldberg in mornings. Another surprise move was the reunion of former KTU morning hosts Sean \"Hollywood\" Hamilton and Goumba Johnny, who hosted afternoons for the station beginning September 5, 2006. Hamilton continues to host his popular syndicated shows the \"Weekend Top 30\" and the \"Remix Top 30\" heard in 114 cites across America and around the world.\n\nHowever, on September 9, 2006, after many format flips by Clear Channel of other radio stations throughout the country, 'KTU took on the upbeat Rhythmic AC direction by playing only popular current rhythmic material, as well as increasing the airplay of older rhythmic sounds such as soul, disco and freestyle.\n\nOn November 28, 2007, WKTU announced that it had dropped Whoopi's morning show. According to station management, the reason was due to Goldberg's duties on \"The View\", although it may also have to do with the show's ratings. Her show continued to air in syndication through Premiere Radio Networks until April 18, 2008, when she called it quits. Cubby Bryant, who served as Goldberg's sidekick, left the syndicated show and returned to WKTU in January 2008 to host his own morning show.\n\nAround 2009, WKTU did another tweak in their Rhythmic AC format, dropping the older elements of dance music (disco and freestyle, including Judy Torres' \"Freestyle Free For All\" Sunday show; Torres has since returned to doing a Sunday afternoon shift at WKTU) and focusing mainly on a current direction, with mainstream dance and rhythmic sounds. It pursued the advertiser-friendly demographic of people who are 25–54 years old. That has helped increase the ratings of the station. In September 2010, the station returned to a Rhythmic Top 40 direction, as WKTU was added to the Mediabase Rhythmic panel joining rival WQHT. On December 15, 2010, Goumba Johnny left WKTU after 15 years, leaving Hamilton solo in afternoons.\n\nOn April 4, 2011, WKTU was moved from the Rhythmic CHR panel on Mediabase to CHR (Top 40), reflecting the recent evolution of the station's music to a more rhythmic adult contemporary sound again without the disco titles. At the same time, Nielsen BDS refrained from including WKTU's playlist on its Top 40/CHR panel because of its direction and having sister station WHTZ as a reporter, but the station did contribute to BDS' Dance/Mix Show Airplay panel due to having club music mix shows on the station up until August 16, 2014, when BDS added WKTU to the Top 40/CHR panel, with the inclusion on non-Rhythmic titles. \n\nOn Memorial Day weekend 2014, WKTU started airing Commercial Free Weekends, in order to compete with WBMP, which also started airing Commercial Free Weekends after the station was relaunched as \"92.3 AMP Radio\". The Commercial Free Weekends era on WKTU lasted until Labor Day weekend 2014.\n\nDespite its Pop-leaning direction, WKTU has continued to embraced current Dance product, even breaking new songs from the genre a lot quicker than its Top 40/CHR or Rhythmic Top 40 counterparts.\n\nWKTU is short-spaced due to 103.3 WPRB cutting into WKTU's reception in central New Jersey and 103.7 WNNJ cutting into its signal in eastern Sussex and Morris counties in northwestern New Jersey.\n\nThe WKTU subcarrier also airs Catholic programming in Italian from Radio Maria New York, the local unit of Radio Maria USA.\n\nWKTU began broadcasting in HD in late Winter 2005. WKTU-HD1 duplicates the analog signal's Rhythmic AC format, while WKTU-HD2 originally broadcast Country music similar to WYNY. On July 23, 2009, the Country music format was dropped in favor of Pride Radio, a lifestyle format targeted to the LGBTQ community.\n\nEvery August, WKTU holds an annual event called Beatstock. The event showcases artists from every dance genre, from disco to electronica, and is held at two locations in the New York area: Jones Beach Theater (now the Nikon at Jones Beach Theater) in Wantagh, New York and The Garden State Arts Center (now the PNC Bank Arts Center) in Holmdel, New Jersey. The original KTU Beatstock concert, which took place in 1997, was an all-day event held at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York. It featured over 50 acts from various genres of dance music, all performing on one stage. For 2011, WKTU had decided to no longer sponsor the event; however, Beatstock continued for the year in Long Island at the Brookhaven Amphitheater on August 20. (That event was featured in \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\", episode 4.12 (July 15, 2012), as two of the cast members - Melissa Gorga and Teresa Giudice's daughter, Gia - performed there.)\n\nIn April 2012, WKTU announced a new concert event called KTUphoria. The all star concert event took place at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey on May 20, 2012 and, like Beatstock, was an all-day event featuring DJs and artists performing on one stage, albeit modified. On June 29, 2014, Ktuphoria was held at Izod Center with Jennifer Lopez, Calvin Harris, The Chainsmokers, Ariana Grande and Cash Cash.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1930677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930677", "title": "Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu", "text": "Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu\n\nDieudonné Sylvain Guy Tancrède de Gratet de Dolomieu usually known as Déodat de Dolomieu (23 June 175028 November 1801) was a French geologist. The mineral and the rock dolomite and the largest summital crater on the Piton de la Fournaise volcano were named after him.\n\nDéodat de Dolomieu was born in Dauphiné, France, one of 11 children of Marie-Françoise de Berénger and her husband, the Marquis de Dolomieu. As a child young Déodat showed considerable intellectual potential and special interest in the natural surroundings of his home in the Alps of southeastern France. De Dolomieu began his military career in the Sovereign and Military Order of the Knights of Saint John (also called the Knights Hospitaller or the Knights of Malta) at the age of 12. His association with the Maltese Order caused him difficulties throughout his life, beginning with a duel, which he fought at the age of 18, when he killed a fellow member of the Order. For this infraction he was sentenced to life in prison but due to the intercession of Pope Clement XIII he was released after only 1 year.\n\nDuring the years prior to the French Revolution Dolomieu took full part in the intellectual ferment of France and the rest of Europe. He maintained numerous social contacts among the nobility and although he never married, Dolomieu had something of a reputation as a ladies' man. Through his friend and mentor, the Duke de La Rochefoucauld, Dolomieu was made a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Sciences. He spent his spare time taking scientific excursions throughout Europe collecting mineral specimens and visiting mining areas. His particular interests included mineralogy, volcanology, and the origin of mountain ranges. Although Dolomieu was greatly interested in volcanoes, he became convinced that water played a major role in shaping the surface of the Earth through a series of prehistoric, catastrophic events. Dolomieu was not a uniformitarian geologist. He has been described as a \"non-actualistic catastrophist\".\n\nHis contemporary, James Hutton, did not publish the principle of uniformitarianism until 1795. Dolomieu was an observationalist and spent much of his time collecting and categorizing geological data. Unlike Hutton, no scientific principles or theories are credited to him, although he left his permanent mark on geology in another way: that is by discovering the mineral dolomite that would be named after him.\n\nDuring one of his voyages to the Alps of Tyrol (today part of northeastern Italy) Dolomieu discovered a calcareous rock which, unlike limestone, did not effervesce with weak hydrochloric acid. He published these observations in 1791 in the well-known French science magazine \"Journal de Physique\". In March 1792, the rock was named \"dolomie\" (or dolomite, in English) by Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure. Today both the rock and its major mineral constituent bear the name of Dolomieu, as do the Dolomites, the mountain range of northeastern Italy. Dolomieu was not the first to describe the mineral dolomite. Most probably it was Linnaeus, who was the first to note the fact that this rock resembled limestone but does not effervesce with dilute acid. In his book \"Oryctographia Carniola, oder physikalische Erdbeschreibung des Herzogthums Krain, Istrien und zum Theil der benachbarten Länder\", published by J. G. I. Breitkopf, Leipzig in 1778, the Austrian naturalist Belsazar Hacquet also observed this distinction between limestone and a rock that Hacquet described as \"lapis suillus\". The two men met in Laibach in 1784, when Dolomieu visited Sigmund Zois. However, Hacquet was well aware of the fact that the description of a limestone that would not effervesce with acid (and therefore had to be different from normal limestone) by the famous Carolus Linnaeus in 1768 preceded his own. On p. 5 of the second volume of his \"Oryctographia Carniola\", which appeared in 1781, Hacquet stated that the white powder he had found near the town of Vorle (\"unterm Teil der Oberkrain\") a white powder that strongly resembled limestone but would not react with dilute hydrochloric acid, reminded him of the Marmor Tardum described by Linnaeus.\n\nIn addition to his scientific activities Dolomieu continued to advance in rank in the Knights of Malta and was promoted to Commander in 1780. However, he continued to have difficulties as a result of his liberal political leanings which were unpopular among the conservative nobility who controlled the Order. De Dolomieu retired from active military service in 1780 to devote all of his time to travels and scientific work.\n\nDe Dolomieu was at first a strong partisan of the French Revolution, which began in 1789. However, the murder of his friend the Duc de la Rochefoucauld, a near-escape from the guillotine, and the beheading of several of his relatives, turned him against the revolution. During this time Dolomieu became a supporter of Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1795, having lost his fortune in the revolution, Dolomieu accepted the position of Professor of Natural Sciences at the École Centrale Paris and started to write the mineralogical section of the Encyclopédie Méthodique. The following year he was appointed Inspector of Mines and Professor at the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris, where his portrait still hangs in the library. His extensive mineral collection is today housed at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle of Paris.\n\nBy 1798 De Dolomieu had developed an international reputation as one of the leading geologists in the world and was invited to join the scientific expedition accompanying Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt, as part of the natural history and physics section of the Institut d'Égypte. In March 1799 Dolomieu became ill and was forced to leave Alexandria, Egypt for France. His ship, caught in a storm, sought refuge at the port of Taranto, Italy where Dolomieu was made a prisoner of war. General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, the father of Alexandre Dumas, the author, was also captured and held. The city was part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which was then at war with France. Dolomieu had previously made a powerful enemy of the Grand Master of the Maltese Order when he helped negotiate the surrender of the island of Malta to Napoleon. The Grand Master denounced Dolomieu and he was transferred to Messina, Sicily and imprisoned under horrible conditions, in solitary confinement, for the next 21 months.\n\nThe imprisonment of a world-famous scientist, under such conditions, was abhorrent to the intellectual community of Europe. Even the scientific community of England (which was at war with France) protested the confinement. Talleyrand, the French foreign minister, attempted to negotiate Dolomieus release through the Pope. Napoleon, who was First Consul of France at the time, felt that asking for such an intervention by the Pope would be dishonorable. The future Emperor's approach to the problem was more direct. In the spring of 1800 Napoleon led the French army into Italy, delivering a crushing blow to the Austrians and their Italian allies on 14 June at the Battle of Marengo. All of Italy then came within Napoleon's sphere. One of the terms dictated by Napoleon in the peace treaty of Florence (March 1801) was the immediate release of Dolomieu.\n\nUpon his liberation Dolomieu resumed his scientific studies and field excursions. But his health, broken by the long imprisonment in Sicily, gave way during a trip to the Alps. Déodat de Dolomieu died on 28 November 1801 at the home of his sister at Châteauneuf.\n\nDr. George F. Kunz wrote about his contributions to mineralogy.\n\nDolomieu's student and famous naturalist Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent gave his name in 1801 to the largest summital crater of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano on the French Island of Réunion, the «\"cratère Dolomieu\"».\n\n"}

His best-known inventions are the U.S. electrical plug and the pull-chain light socket.\n\nIn 1888, at the age of thirty-one, Hubbell quit his job as a manager of a manufacturing company and founded Hubbell Incorporated in Bridgeport, Connecticut, a company which is still in business today, still headquartered near Bridgeport. Hubbell began manufacturing consumer products and, by necessity, inventing manufacturing equipment for his factory. Some of the equipment he designed included automatic tapping machines and progressive dies for blanking and stamping. One of his most important industrial inventions, still in use today, is the thread rolling machine. He quickly began selling his newly devised manufacturing equipment alongside his commercial products.\n\nHubbell received at least 45 patents, most of which were for electric products. The pull-chain electrical light socket was patented in 1896, and his most famous invention, the U.S. electrical power plug, in 1904. It brought the convenience of portable electrical devices, already enjoyed in Great Britain since the early 1880s, to the U.S. Hubbell was also granted a patent in 1916 for a three-bladed power plug, which Australian regulators and electrical accessory manufacturers adopted as the standard for that country in the 1930s. It was also adopted in New Zealand, Argentina and, with a minor variation, China.\n\n"}

Established in 1955, it is the fourth oldest university in Turkey. Karadeniz Technical University is a state university institution subject to the Law No. 2547 on Higher Education in Turkey. It is supported mainly by state funds allocated by the Turkish Parliament.\n\nThe university has 80 departments, 12 faculties and 6 graduate schools. With 2122 teaching staff and 39763 students, Karadeniz Technical University is one of the largest universities in Turkey.\n\nFounded on 20 May 1955, Karadeniz Technical University (KTU) is the fourth oldest university in Turkey, and the first university established outside İstanbul and Ankara. After a period of eight years, on 19 September 1963, the faculties of Natural Sciences, Civil Engineering-Architecture, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and Forestry, which are the foundation stone of today's Karadeniz Technical University, were established. Four months later, on 2 December 1963 the University began its educational activities. The campus site has been gradually expanding since then and, with all kinds of social, cultural and sports requirements met on site, it has turned into an outstanding site set in a green belt of woodlands and playing grounds, which makes it one of the best campus settings in the world.\n\nExpansion of the university continued with the opening of faculties of Earth Sciences, and medicine in 1973. Twelve km away from the main campus, a new campus has been established where educational faculty with many departments in a variety of teaching fields has been set up. Karadeniz Technical University is still expanding with the introduction of new departments. Faculties of communication and dentistry are the most recent academic units established.\n\nTeaching language at Karadeniz Technical University is mainly Turkish. However, the increasing demand towards having courses in English has been taken into consideration by the administration. Recent developments include acceptance of new departments into Obligatory English Preparatory Programme before the commencement of the degree programme. Currently the students of first cycle degree programmes must show the required qualifications in English to be able to start the degree courses. All of the second and third cycle programmes have already been in this process for many years. In departments with English preparatory class, up to 30% of the courses are offered in English. Some of the postgraduate courses are also taught in English. A complete list of the courses and their teaching media is given in the information packages of each department.\n\nFor exchange students separate classes can be arranged in English should they ask for it. All the exchange students are encouraged to include a course of Basic Turkish Language in their learning agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECTS credits for each course included in a study programme was calculated based on true student workload. This includes:\n(1) asking the course directors (lecturers / instructors),\n(2) carrying out questionnaires with the successful students upon their completion of each course, and\n(3) getting the average value excluding the outliers to achieve a more reliable estimate.\n\nAs part of the integration into the European higher education area, Karadeniz Technical University ensures recognition of credits received in another higher education institution with which it has bilateral agreements, provided that the courses taken by the students are pre-agreed on by the departmental committee. Therefore, the students wishing to study abroad under the Erasmus+ programme are asked to get their learning agreements approved by their departments before application to the host institution. The signatures on the learning agreement assure the exchange students that their credits will be recognised and incorporated into their transcript of records as courses taken abroad. To ensure the recognition, the students are also asked to prepare a document of course equivalence in which the courses to be taken abroad and those they will be considered equal with after the mobility period are shown. This document, which is signed by the student and the members of the recognition committee of the department composed of the head of department, the Erasmus+ coordinator and the staff member responsible for course equivalence, and signed and stamped by the dean following a discussion in the faculty board, is a guarantor for the student in question showing that the courses to be taken abroad will be recognised as shon on the document.\n\nIf any changes are needed on the learning agreement, both the changes and the newly prepared equivalence document must be sent back to the home institution to follow the same track to be valid. Following the mobility period, the students are required to bring the transcript of records obtained from the host institution together with other documents such as learning agreement to the International Office which then gets in touch with the departmental coordinators to get the recognition process under the way. We make sure that the recognition is complete and all the courses passed by the student at the host institution are fully recognised by the department provided that they were pre-discussed and agreed up on by the student and the departmental recognition committee.\n\nThe Best Global Universities Ranking of the \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranks KTU 1100th in the world and 574th in the subject area \"Engineering\" as of 2019.\n\nIn the recent Academic Ranking of World Universities 2018/2019, KTU is ranked at 201-300th in \"Civil Engineering\", 301-400th in \"Mechanical Engineering\", and 401-500th in \"Chemical Engineering.\n\nBy CWTS Leiden Ranking 2019, KTU is ranked at 818th (overall), 681st in \"Biomedical and Health Sciences\", 596th in \"Life and Earth Sciences\", 690th in \"Mathematics and Computer Science\" and 656th in \"Physical Sciences and Engineering\".\n\nBy URAP 2019, KTU is ranked at 1135th (overall), 756th in the broad subject area \"Engineering\", 378th in \"Civil Engineering\" and 897th in \"Medical and Health Sciences\".\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\nSince its establishment, Karadeniz Technical University has been heavily involved in international cooperation. Over the past few years, however, it has realised an enormous increase in international activities involving staff and student exchanges with universities in Japan, Central Asian Turkic republics, United States and many countries in Europe.\n\nKaradeniz Technical University, which is one of the first universities in Turkey to join the Socrates-Erasmus program, matched with Gent University in Belgium, obtained Erasmus charter in 2003 (Charter No: 221082-IC-1-2003-1-TR-ERASMUS-EUCX-1). Since then, the number of bilateral agreements and the number of outgoing and incoming exchange students have increased steadily. The main aim is to receive as many students as we send abroad. Therefore, the university tries its utmost to help the incoming students to make their stay here exciting and rewarding. Believing that it may take quite a while for anyone to get used to the new environment, all incoming students are matched with a Turkish host whose role is to help his/her counterpart feel at home.\n\nThe university is a member of the Caucasus University Association.\n\n\n"}

He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under a People's National Movement (PNM) administration, Minister of Communication and Information Technology under a United National Congress (UNC) administration, and was a founding member of National Team Unity before returning to the PNM to work as a speech writer for Prime Minister Patrick Manning. Prior to entering politics in 1991, Maraj worked as a teacher at Naparima College in San Fernando. He also attended that school. He wrote several plays, the most successful being \"Cynthia Sweetness\". Maraj also starred in the movies \"The Right and The Wrong\" (1969) and \"Bim\" (1974), described by Bruce Paddington as \"one of the most important films to be produced in Trinidad and Tobago\".\n\nMaraj entered politics in 1991. He won the San Fernando West seat in the 1991 General Elections on a PNM ticket. Maraj served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from December 1991 until 7 May 1995, when Prime Minister Manning announced in a television address that he was demoting Maraj to Minister Without Portfolio in the Office of the Prime Minister. Maraj claimed that this was the first he heard of this shift in his Ministerial duties. Later that year Maraj's sister, Occah Seapaul, Speaker of the House of Representatives, was removed from the position following a power struggle with Manning. After Seapaul's removal, Maraj defected from the PNM and joined the Opposition UNC. This reduced the PNM to an almost unworkable one-seat majority in Parliament. Manning was forced to call a General Election which he lost. Maraj contested the Naparima constituency on a UNC ticket and won. Maraj was re-elected to that seat in the 2000 General Election. In the subsequent UNC administration Maraj served as Minister of Communication and Information Technology until he resigned from the party, together with Ramesh Maharaj and Trevor Sudama, late in 2001. This defection cost the UNC its majority in Parliament. In the subsequent General Election, the UNC lost control of government, but Maraj lost his seat to newcomer Nizam Baksh.\n\nMaraj resumed his theatre career in 2013, when his play \"The Saint\" was performed in San Fernando's Naparima Bowl.\n\n"}

Written and produced by Max Martin, Per Magnusson and David Kreuger with additional writing by Jörgen Elofsson and remix by Martin and Rami Yacoub, it was released as the album's third single on August 21, 1999 by Jive Records. It was featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 teen romantic comedy film \"Drive Me Crazy\". The song garnered positive reviews from music critics, some of whom praised its simple formula and noted similarities to Spears' debut single, \"...Baby One More Time\".\n\n\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was a commercial success and peaked inside the top ten on the singles charts of seventeen countries. In the United Kingdom, it became Spears' third consecutive single to peak inside the top five, while it reached number 10 in the United States' \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and peaked at number one in Belgium (Wallonia) and Iceland. An accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick and portrayed Spears as a waitress of a dance club and performed a highly choreographed dance routine with the other waitresses. The video premiered on MTV's \"Making the Video\" special and featured cameo appearances of actors Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier. As part of promotion for the song, Spears performed the song at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards and 1999 Billboard Music Awards. It has also been included on five of her concert tours.\n\nBefore recording her debut album, Spears had originally envisioned it in style of \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger [and] more adult contemporary\". However, the singer agreed with her label's appointment of producers, who had the objective to target a teenage audience at the time. She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded in May 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was written by Jörgen Elofsson, while song production and additional songwriting was done by Martin, Per Magnusson and David Kreuger. Spears recorded the vocals for the song in March 1998, at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. It was also mixed at Cheiron Studios by Martin. Esbjörn Öhrwall and Johan Carlberg played the guitar, while bass guitar was done by Thomas Lindberg. Keyboards and programming was done by Kreuger, and additional keyboards by Magnusson. Background vocals were provided by Jeanette Söderholm, Martin, Yacoub and THE FANCHOIR, formed by Chatrin Nyström, Jeanette Stenhammar, Johanna Stenhammar, Charlotte Björkman and Therese Ancker. In May 1999, Martin and Spears went to the Battery Studios in New York City, New York, to re-record the vocals of the track, due to the fact that a remixed version called \"The Stop! Remix\" was going to be included on the original motion picture soundtrack of the film \"Drive Me Crazy\" (1999). \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was released as a remix package as the third single from \"...Baby One More Time\" on August 23, 1999.\n\n\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" is a pop song. The song's composition follows a simple formula and infuses drums, guitar, and edgy synthesized instruments, including a recurring cowbell, and having a roughly similar sound to Spears' debut single \"...Baby One More Time\" (1999). According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" is composed in the key of C minor and runs through a moderately slow dance beat infused metronome of 101 beats per minute. Spears' vocals were deemed as heavily processed when compared to the ones of her previous single, \"Sometimes\". Her vocal range spans over an octave, from the low-key of G to the high-note of D. The song's primary chord progression is Cm–A-G (vi-IV-III), with a few deviations.\n\nThe song garnered positive reviews from music critics. Kyle Anderson for MTV considered \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" as \"a similar-sounding anthem [to '...Baby One More Time'] with some streamlined rock guitar taking center stage (there's even a solo). It's catchy enough\". Spence D. of IGN considered \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" a \"[Max] Martin's glossy grown-up pop\" song, while Caryn Ganz of \"Rolling Stone\" called \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" a \"further hit\" from \"...Baby One More Time\", along with \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" and \"Sometimes\". Music critic Walt Mueller wrote \"When Spears starts to sing on this one, she sounds a lot like Janet Jackson\". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press noted that the song and \"Stronger\" are \"so lamely feel-good\" tracks that they \"could have been the theme song to a 'Karate Kid' sequel\". Evan Sawdey of \"PopMatters\" called it a \"lightly dorky\" song, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic deemed it as a \"fluffy dance-pop at its best\". In a list compiled by Sara Anderson of AOL Radio, \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was ranked ninth in a list of Spears' best songs. During the 2001 BMI Pop Awards, \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was honored with the award of Most Performed BMI Song.\n\nWhile reviewing \"...Baby One More Time\" on its 20th anniversary, \"Billboard\"s Chuck Arnold felt that \"sparkling with the Midas touch of Max Martin, 'Crazy' perfectly captures the crazy giddiness of young love -- the kind that keeps you up all night\". The staff from \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed it at number 22 on their ranking of Spears's songs and wrote: \"highlighted by her overpronunciation of “you”, bell rings, and a backup choir that turns the chorus into a massive singalong. ['(You Drive Me) Crazy'] captures Spears at full force, with a robust vocal performance and an ab-emphasizing choreographed dance, remembered best through its music video\". \"Bustle\"s Alex Kritelis Reilly preferred the Stop! remix over the original album version. Nayer Nissim, from \"Pink News\", deemed it \"another perfect bit of late '90s pop. Very nearly as catchy as her debut\". Shannon Barbour from \"Cosmopolitan\" opined that it was \"not her best song, but it's insanely addictive\". Nicholas Hautman, from \"Us Weekly\", deemed it the singer's ninth greatest single and said: \"This quasi-dorky dance track can be easily summed up using just three words: pure ear candy\". For Digital Spy's Alim Kheraj the most notable thing was the song's prominent use of cowbells; \"backed up by rock guitars and flawless Max Martin production, Britney sounds confident, her vocals clear and powerful\".\n\n\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was a commercial success. The song peaked at number two on the European Hot 100 Singles, being held off the top spot by R. Kelly's \"If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time\". In the United Kingdom, it was Spears' third consecutive single to reach a top five position. The track debuted and peaked at number five on the chart issue dated October 2, 1999, and stayed on the chart for a total of eleven weeks. It was eventually certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), for shipments over 200,000 units. According to the Official Charts Company, \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" is Spears' seventh best-selling single in the United Kingdom, with sales over 275,000 physical units. The song peaked at number two in France and number four in Germany, being certified Gold in both countries for shipping over 250,000 units. It also peaked at number one in Belgium (Wallonia), finishing the year of 1999 as the 17th best-selling single. \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was also able to peak inside the top five in Belgium (Flanders), Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, while reaching top ten positions in Denmark and Italy. Later in 2012, the song managed to peak at number 65 in Czech Republic due to high airplay.\n\nIn the United States, \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" peaked at number ten on \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the chart issue dated November 13, 1999, and became Spears' second single to peak inside the top ten in the country. On the same week, it peaked at number four on the Pop Songs component chart. On the chart compiled by \"RPM\" magazine, the song peaked at number three in Canada. However, on the Canadian Hot 100 compiled by Nielsen Soundscan, it peaked at number 13. The latter revealed that \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was the 44th best-selling single of 1999 in the country. The track peaked at number five in New Zealand, but failed to reach the top ten in Australia, where it peaked at number 12 on the chart issue dated November 12, 1999. However, the single was later certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and was one of the best-selling singles of 2000 in the country. \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" performed poorly in Japan, where it peaked at number 80, and stayed on the chart for two weeks only. Despite the low sales, it is Spears' 12th best-selling CD release in the country.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video (using the Stop! Remix) was directed by Nigel Dick and filmed on June 14 and 15, 1999 at the AES Power Station in Redondo Beach, California. Spears conceptualized the video's treatment, and explained during an interview with MTV in 1999 that \"it would be cool to be in a club, and we're dorky waitresses, and we break out and start dancing.\" At the time, Spears expected that the video would take her \"to the next level\". To promote the film \"Drive Me Crazy\", actors Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart were invited to make cameo appearances in the video, since the song had been included on the film's soundtrack, however, Grenier did not want to participate. Dick commented on the issue, saying, \"I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video. I said, 'You know what, Adrian, I just think it would be great for your career, and Britney's a great girl and she's fun to work with.' Eventually he came around.\" Dick also revealed that he was impressed by the singer's work ethic, adding that she \"came to the set completely rehearsed.\" The music video premiered on MTV's \"Making the Video\" special that aired on July 18, 1999.\nDue to Hart's appearance in the music video, parts of it were featured in the credits of the Season 4 premiere of \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\", an episode that guest starred Spears.\n\nThe video opens with Spears as a waitress of a dance club. She then goes with other waitresses to their dressing room, where they finish their make-up and change costumes. Spears, now wearing a green sparkly outfit, goes through the corridor to the dance floor with her friends, and starts to perform a high-profile choreography, including a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's \"Miss You Much\" video, which Spears also referenced in live performances of the song on the \"Crazy 2K Tour\". Scenes of Spears singing in front of a shining orange sign with the word \"CRAZY\" are also seen throughout the video. On August 24, 1999, the music video debuted at number four on \"Total Request Live\". It is the longest running by a female artist on \"TRL\", staying on the top ten for seventy-three days. The video was nominated on the category of Best Dance Video on the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards; it lost, however, to Jennifer Lopez's \"Waiting for Tonight\" (1999). An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album \"\" (2004). Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented, \"the alternate audio gives the feel of Spears singing the song as a round, where the beat is in sync but one layer of her vocals is just slightly ahead of the other.\"\n\nBritney performed the song for the very first time at her \"The Hair Zone Mall Tour\" (promotional mini tour) in New York City, USA on July 1, 1998. As part of promotion for \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\"s release as a single, Spears performed it at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards and at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards. It was also performed on five concert tours, the first being the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999). The show began with a dance introduction by Spears' dancers among smoke effects. She appeared shortly after at the top of the staircase wearing a hot pink vinyl tube top and white vinyl pants with pink knee patches. During the 2000 leg of the tour, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, Spears changed the opening sequence of the show; the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of \"...Baby One More Time\". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\", which included a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's \"Miss You Much\" music video that ended with Spears saying \"Is that the end?\", quoting Jackson's phrase from the video. The song was once again performed in a dance-oriented form on the Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour (2000), while in 2001's Dream Within a Dream Tour, the performance featured Spears being captured by her dancers. \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was also performed on The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004). For the tour, the song was remixed with elements of latin percussion. \"Crazy\" would not be performed by Spears for another nine years until it was included on the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show .\n\nIn 2003, American musician Richard Cheese covered \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" and included it on his album \"Tuxicity\". American pop band Selena Gomez & the Scene performed a homage to Spears during their 2011 We Own the Night Tour. They performed \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" along with a medley of hits that included \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", \"Toxic\" and \"Hold It Against Me\", mixed similar to the Chris Cox Megamix included in \"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\". In the 2012 \"Glee\" episode \"Britney 2.0\", the characters of Marley Rose and Jake Puckerman performed a medley of the track with Aerosmith's \"Crazy\" (1993).\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits for \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" are taken from the single's liner notes.\n\nTechnical\n\nPersonnel\n"}

{"id": "1930784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930784", "title": "Crookes tube", "text": "Crookes tube\n\nA Crookes tube (also Crookes–Hittorf tube) is an early experimental electrical discharge tube, with partial vacuum, invented by English physicist William Crookes and others around 1869-1875, in which cathode rays, streams of electrons, were discovered. \n\nDeveloped from the earlier Geissler tube, the Crookes tube consists of a partially evacuated glass bulb of various shapes, with two metal electrodes, the cathode and the anode, one at either end. When a high voltage is applied between the electrodes, cathode rays (electrons) are projected in straight lines from the cathode. It was used by Crookes, Johann Hittorf, Julius Plücker, Eugen Goldstein, Heinrich Hertz, Philipp Lenard, Kristian Birkeland and others to discover the properties of cathode rays, culminating in J.J. Thomson's 1897 identification of cathode rays as negatively charged particles, which were later named \"electrons\". Crookes tubes are now used only for demonstrating cathode rays.\n\nWilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays using the Crookes tube in 1895. The term \"Crookes tube\" is also used for the first generation, cold cathode X-ray tubes, which evolved from the experimental Crookes tubes and were used until about 1920.\n\nCrookes tubes are cold cathode tubes, meaning that they do not have a heated filament in them that releases electrons as the later electronic vacuum tubes usually do. Instead, electrons are generated by the ionization of the residual air by a high DC voltage (from a few kilovolts to about 100 kilovolts) applied between the cathode and anode electrodes in the tube, usually by an induction coil (a \"Ruhmkorff coil\"). The Crookes tubes require a small amount of air in them to function, from about 10 to 5×10 atmosphere (7×10 - 4×10 torr or 0.1-0.005 pascal).\n\nWhen high voltage is applied to the tube, the electric field accelerates the small number of electrically charged ions and free electrons always present in the gas, created by natural processes like photoionization and radioactivity. The electrons collide with other gas molecules, knocking electrons off them and creating more positive ions. The electrons go on to create more ions and electrons in a chain reaction called a Townsend discharge. All the positive ions are attracted to the cathode or negative electrode. When they strike it, they knock large numbers of electrons out of the surface of the metal, which in turn are repelled by the cathode and attracted to the anode or positive electrode. These are the cathode rays.\n\nEnough of the air has been removed from the tube that most of the electrons can travel the length of the tube without striking a gas molecule. The high voltage accelerates these low-mass particles to a high velocity (about 37,000 miles per second, or 59,000 km/s, about 20 percent of the speed of light, for a typical tube voltage of 10 kV). When they get to the anode end of the tube, they have so much momentum that, although they are attracted to the anode, many fly past it and strike the end wall of the tube. When they strike atoms in the glass, they knock their orbital electrons into a higher energy level. When the electrons fall back to their original energy level, they emit light. This process, called cathodoluminescence, causes the glass to glow, usually yellow-green. The electrons themselves are invisible, but the glow reveals where the beam of electrons strikes the glass. Later on, researchers painted the inside back wall of the tube with a phosphor, a fluorescent chemical such as zinc sulfide, in order to make the glow more visible. After striking the wall, the electrons eventually make their way to the anode, flow through the anode wire, the power supply, and back to the cathode.\n\nThe above only describes the motion of the electrons. The full details of the action in a Crookes tube are complicated, because it contains a nonequilibrium plasma of positively charged ions, electrons, and neutral atoms which are constantly interacting. At higher gas pressures, above 10 atm (0.1 Pa), this creates a glow discharge; a pattern of different colored glowing regions in the gas, depending on the pressure in the tube (see diagram). The details were not fully understood until the development of plasma physics in the early 20th century.\n\nCrookes tubes evolved from the earlier Geissler tubes invented by the German physicist and glassblower Heinrich Geissler in 1857, experimental tubes which are similar to modern neon tube lights. Geissler tubes had only a low vacuum, around 10 atm (100 Pa), and the electrons in them could only travel a short distance before hitting a gas molecule. So the current of electrons moved in a slow diffusion process, constantly colliding with gas molecules, never gaining much energy. These tubes did not create beams of cathode rays, only a colorful glow discharge that filled the tube as the electrons struck the gas molecules and excited them, producing light.\n\nBy the 1870s, Crookes (among other researchers) was able to evacuate his tubes to a lower pressure, 10 to 5x10 atm, using an improved Sprengel mercury vacuum pump invented by his coworker Charles A. Gimingham. He found that as he pumped more air out of his tubes, a dark area in the glowing gas formed next to the cathode. As the pressure got lower, the dark area, now called the \"Faraday dark space\" or \"Crookes dark space\", spread down the tube, until the inside of the tube was totally dark. However, the glass envelope of the tube began to glow at the anode end.\n\nWhat was happening was that as more air was pumped out of the tube, there were fewer gas molecules to obstruct the motion of the electrons from the cathode, so they could travel a longer distance, on average, before they struck one. By the time the inside of the tube became dark, they were able to travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode, without a collision. They were accelerated to a high velocity by the electric field between the electrodes, both because they did not lose energy to collisions, and also because Crookes tubes were operated at a higher voltage. By the time they reached the anode end of the tube, they were going so fast that many flew past the anode and hit the glass wall. The electrons themselves were invisible, but when they hit the glass walls of the tube they excited the atoms in the glass, making them give off light or fluoresce, usually yellow-green. Later experimenters painted the back wall of Crookes tubes with fluorescent paint, to make the beams more visible.\n\nThis accidental fluorescence allowed researchers to notice that objects in the tube, such as the anode, cast a sharp-edged shadow on the tube wall. Johann Hittorf was first to recognise in 1869 that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadow. In 1876, Eugen Goldstein proved that they came from the cathode, and named them \"cathode rays\" (\"Kathodenstrahlen\").\n\nAt the time, atoms were the smallest particles known and were believed to be indivisible, the electron was unknown, and what carried electric currents was a mystery. During the last quarter of the 19th century, many ingenious types of Crookes tubes were invented and used in historic experiments to determine what cathode rays were (see below). There were two theories: Crookes believed they were 'radiant matter'; that is, electrically charged atoms, while German scientists Hertz and Goldstein believed they were 'aether vibrations'; some new form of electromagnetic waves. The debate was resolved in 1897 when J. J. Thomson measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, hydrogen. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first \"subatomic\" particle to be discovered, which was later named the \"electron\". It was quickly realized that these particles were also responsible for electric currents in wires, and carried the negative charge in the atom.\n\nThe colorful glowing tubes were also popular in public lectures to demonstrate the mysteries of the new science of electricity. Decorative tubes were made with fluorescent minerals, or butterfly figures painted with fluorescent paint, sealed inside. When power was applied, the fluorescent materials lit up with many glowing colors.\n\nIn 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays emanating from Crookes tubes. The many uses for X-rays were immediately apparent, the first practical application for Crookes tubes. Medical manufacturers began to produce specialized Crookes tubes to generate X-rays, the first X-ray tubes. \n\nCrookes tubes were unreliable and temperamental. Both the energy and the quantity of cathode rays produced depended on the pressure of residual gas in the tube. Over time the gas was absorbed by the walls of the tube, reducing the pressure. This reduced the amount of cathode rays produced and caused the voltage across the tube to increase, creating more energetic cathode rays. In Crookes X-ray tubes this phenomenon was called \"hardening\" because the higher voltage produced \"harder\", more penetrating X-rays; a tube with a higher vacuum was called a \"hard\" tube, while one with lower vacuum was a \"soft\" tube. Eventually the pressure got so low the tube stopped working entirely. To prevent this, in heavily used tubes such as X-ray tubes various \"softener\" devices were incorporated that released a small amount of gas, restoring the tube's function.\n\nThe electronic vacuum tubes invented later around 1904 superseded the Crookes tube. These operate at a still lower pressure, around 10 atm (10 Pa), at which there are so few gas molecules that they do not conduct by ionization. Instead, they use a more reliable and controllable source of electrons, a heated filament or hot cathode which releases electrons by thermionic emission. The ionization method of creating cathode rays used in Crookes tubes is today only used in a few specialized gas discharge tubes such as thyratrons.\n\nThe technology of manipulating electron beams pioneered in Crookes tubes was applied practically in the design of vacuum tubes, and particularly in the invention of the cathode ray tube by Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is now used in sophisticated processes such as electron beam lithography.\n\nWhen the voltage applied to a Crookes tube is high enough, around 5,000 volts or greater, it can accelerate the electrons to a high enough velocity to create X-rays when they hit the anode or the glass wall of the tube. The fast electrons emit X-rays when their path is bent sharply as they pass near the high electric charge of an atom's nucleus, a process called bremsstrahlung, or they knock an atom's inner electrons into a higher energy level, and these in turn emit X-rays as they return to their former energy level, a process called X-ray fluorescence. Many early Crookes tubes undoubtedly generated X-rays, because early researchers such as Ivan Pulyui had noticed that they could make foggy marks on nearby unexposed photographic plates. On November 8, 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen was operating a Crookes tube covered with black cardboard when he noticed that a nearby fluorescent screen glowed faintly. He realized that some unknown invisible rays from the tube were able to pass through the cardboard and make the screen fluoresce. He found that they could pass through books and papers on his desk. Röntgen began to investigate the rays full-time, and on December 28, 1895, published the first scientific research paper on X-rays. Röntgen\nwas awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics (in 1901) for his discoveries.\n\nThe many applications of X-rays created the first practical use for Crookes tubes, and workshops began manufacturing specialized Crookes tubes to generate X-rays, the first X-ray tubes. The anode was made of a heavy metal, usually platinum, which generated more X-rays, and was tilted at an angle to the cathode, so the X-rays would radiate through the side of the tube. The cathode had a concave spherical surface which focused the electrons into a small spot around 1 mm in diameter on the anode, in order to approximate a point source of X-rays, which gave the sharpest radiographs. These cold cathode type X-ray tubes were used until about 1920, when they were superseded by the hot cathode Coolidge X-ray tube.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century Crookes tubes were used in dozens of historic experiments to try to find out what cathode rays were. There were two theories: British scientists Crookes and Cromwell Varley believed they were particles of 'radiant matter', that is, electrically charged atoms. German researchers E. Wiedemann, Heinrich Hertz, and Eugen Goldstein believed they were 'aether vibrations', some new form of electromagnetic waves, and were separate from what carried the current through the tube. The debate continued until J.J. Thomson measured their mass, proving they were a previously unknown negatively charged particle, the first subatomic particle, which he called a 'corpuscle' but was later renamed the 'electron'.\n\nJulius Plücker in 1869 built a tube with an anode shaped like a Maltese Cross facing the cathode. It was hinged, so it could fold down against the floor of the tube. When the tube was turned on, the cathode rays cast a sharp cross-shaped shadow on the fluorescence on the back face of the tube, showing that the rays moved in straight lines. This fluorescence was used as an argument that cathode rays were electromagnetic waves, since the only thing known to cause fluorescence at the time was ultraviolet light. After a while the fluorescence would get 'tired' and the glow would decrease. If the cross was folded down out of the path of the rays, it no longer cast a shadow, and the previously shadowed area would fluoresce more strongly than the area around it.\n\nEugen Goldstein in 1876 found that cathode rays were always emitted perpendicular to the cathode's surface. If the cathode was a flat plate, the rays were shot out in straight lines perpendicular to the plane of the plate. This was evidence that they were particles, because a luminous object, like a red hot metal plate, emits light in all directions, while a charged particle will be repelled by the cathode in a perpendicular direction. If the electrode was made in the form of a concave spherical dish, the cathode rays would be focused to a spot in front of the dish. This could be used to heat samples to a high temperature.\n\nHeinrich Hertz built a tube with a second pair of metal plates to either side of the cathode ray beam, a crude CRT. If the cathode rays were charged particles, their path should be bent by the electric field created when a voltage was applied to the plates, causing the spot of light where the rays hit to move sideways. He did not find any bending, but it was later determined that his tube was insufficiently evacuated, causing accumulations of surface charge which masked the electric field. Later Arthur Shuster repeated the experiment with a higher vacuum. He found that the rays were attracted toward a positively charged plate and repelled by a negative one, bending the beam. This was evidence they were negatively charged, and therefore not electromagnetic waves.\nCrookes put a magnet across the neck of the tube, so that the North pole was on one side of the beam and the South pole was on the other, and the beam travelled through the magnetic field between them. The beam was bent down, perpendicular to the magnetic field. To reveal the path of the beam, Crookes invented a tube \"(see pictures)\" with a cardboard screen with a phosphor coating down the length of the tube, at a slight angle so the electrons would strike the phosphor along its length, making a glowing line on the screen. The line could be seen to bend up or down in a transverse magnetic field. This effect (now called the Lorentz force) was similar to the behavior of electric currents in an electric motor and showed that the cathode rays obeyed Faraday's law of induction like currents in wires. Both electric and magnetic deflection were evidence for the particle theory, because electric and magnetic fields have no effect on a beam of light waves.\n\nCrookes put a tiny vaned turbine or paddlewheel in the path of the cathode rays, and found that it rotated when the rays hit it. The paddlewheel turned in a direction away from the cathode side of the tube, suggesting that the force of the cathode rays striking the paddles was causing the rotation. Crookes concluded at the time that this showed that cathode rays had momentum, so the rays were likely matter particles. However, later it was concluded that the paddle wheel turned not due to the momentum of the particles (or electrons) hitting the paddle wheel but due to the radiometric effect. When the rays hit the paddle surface they heated it, and the heat caused the gas next to it to expand, pushing the paddle. This was proven in 1903 by J. J. Thomson who calculated that the momentum of the electrons hitting the paddle wheel would only be sufficient to turn the wheel one revolution per minute. All this experiment really showed was that cathode rays were able to heat surfaces.\nJean-Baptiste Perrin wanted to determine whether the cathode rays actually carried negative charge, or whether they just accompanied the charge carriers, as the Germans thought. In 1895 he constructed a tube with a 'catcher', a closed aluminum cylinder with a small hole in the end facing the cathode, to collect the cathode rays. The catcher was attached to an electroscope to measure its charge. The electroscope showed a negative charge, proving that cathode rays really carry negative electricity.\n\nGoldstein found in 1886 that if the cathode is made with small holes in it, streams of a faint luminous glow will be seen issuing from the holes on the back side of the cathode, facing away from the anode. It was found that in an electric field these anode rays bend in the opposite direction from cathode rays, toward a negatively charged plate, indicating that they carry a positive charge. These were the positive ions which were attracted to the cathode, and created the cathode rays. They were named \"canal rays\" (\"Kanalstrahlen\") by Goldstein.\nEugen Goldstein thought he had figured out a method of measuring the speed of cathode rays. If the glow discharge seen in the gas of Crookes tubes was produced by the moving cathode rays, the light radiated from them in the direction they were moving, down the tube, would be shifted in frequency due to the Doppler effect. This could be detected with a spectroscope because the emission line spectrum would be shifted. He built a tube shaped like an \"L\", with a spectroscope pointed through the glass of the elbow down one of the arms. He measured the spectrum of the glow when the spectroscope was pointed toward the cathode end, then switched the power supply connections so the cathode became the anode and the electrons were moving in the other direction, and again observed the spectrum looking for a shift. He did not find one, which he calculated meant that the rays were traveling very slowly. It was later recognized that the glow in Crookes tubes is emitted from gas atoms hit by the electrons, not the electrons themselves. Since the atoms are thousands of times more massive than the electrons, they move much slower, accounting for the lack of Doppler shift.\n\nPhilipp Lenard wanted to see if cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air. See diagram. He built a tube with a \"window\" \"(W)\" in the glass envelope made of aluminum foil just thick enough to hold the atmospheric pressure out (later called a \"Lenard window\") facing the cathode \"(C)\" so the cathode rays would hit it. He found that something did come through. Holding a fluorescent screen up to the window caused it to fluoresce, even though no light reached it. A photographic plate held up to it would be darkened, even though it was not exposed to light. The effect had a very short range of about . He measured the ability of cathode rays to penetrate sheets of material, and found they could penetrate much farther than moving atoms could. Since atoms were the smallest particles known at the time, this was first taken as evidence that cathode rays were waves. Later it was realized that electrons were much smaller than atoms, accounting for their greater penetration ability. Lenard was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905 for his work.\n\n\n"}

The improved Mk16 guns of the main battery were the first auto-loading 8\" guns fielded by the US Navy, and allowed a much higher rate of fire than earlier designs, capable of sustaining eight shots per minute per barrel, or about twice what previous heavy cruisers could. The auto-loading mechanism could function at any elevation, giving even these large-caliber guns some anti-aircraft ability. While the secondary battery of six twin 5\"/38 Mk12 DP guns was essentially unchanged from the and \"Baltimore\"-class cruisers, the \"Des Moines\" class carried a stronger battery of small-caliber anti-aircraft guns, including 12 twin 3-inch/50 Mk27 and later Mk33 guns, that were considered superior to the earlier ships' quad-mounted 40mm Bofors against then current airborne threats.\n\nTwelve ships of the class were programmed, but only three ships were completed: , , and , with USS \"Dallas\" (CA-140) canceled when she was approximately 28 percent complete.\n\nTheir speed made them valuable to escort carrier groups and they were useful in showing the flag in goodwill visits.

The ship's missions included shelling military targets close to the North Vietnam shoreline, and destroying shore batteries with her counterbattery fire. In August 1972 she raided Haiphong harbor at night with other US Navy ships to knock out coastal defences and other high-value targets including SAM sites and Cat Bi airfield.\n\n\"Newport News\" had the distinction of being the last active all-gun cruiser (serving 25.5 years continuously) and the first completely air-conditioned surface ship in the U.S. Navy. \"Salem\" is a museum ship in Quincy, Massachusetts. \"Newport News\" was laid up at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and scrapped in 1993, and \"Des Moines\" was scrapped in 2006–2007. \"Dallas\" (CA-140) and eight other ships (CA-141 through CA-143 and CA-149 through CA-153) were canceled at the end of World War II.\n\n"}

He was a Sergeant (E-5) in the infantry when he was killed under heroic circumstances on April 11, 1966, at age 25.\n\nBorn in 1940 in Hinsdale, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, Robinson graduated from Morton High School in 1958 and enlisted in the U.S. Marines, serving primarily in Okinawa. After his service ended in 1961, Robinson worked in the private sector in Northern Virginia, then re-enlisted in 1964, this time in the U.S. Army. Assigned to duty in Panama, Robinson relentlessly requested a transfer to Southeast Asia, which was finally granted in 1965.\n\nRobinson is listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on panel 06E, row 102, and is buried at the Clarendon Hills Cemetery in Darien, Illinois. He was the first Virginia resident to receive the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War.\n\nRobinson Secondary School, opened in 1971 in Northern Virginia's Fairfax County, is named in his honor, as is Robinson Elementary School in Lyons, Illinois.

Company C was engaged in fierce combat with a Viet Cong battalion. Despite the heavy fire, Sgt. Robinson moved among the men of his fire team, instructing and inspiring them, and placing them in advantageous positions. Enemy snipers located in nearby trees were inflicting heavy casualties on forward elements of Sgt. Robinson's unit. Upon locating the enemy sniper whose fire was taking the heaviest toll, he took a grenade launcher and eliminated the sniper.\n\nSeeing a medic hit while administering aid to a wounded sergeant in front of his position and aware that now the 2 wounded men were at the mercy of the enemy, he charged through a withering hail of fire and dragged his comrades to safety, where he rendered first aid and saved their lives. As the battle continued and casualties mounted, Sgt. Robinson moved about under intense fire to collect from the wounded their weapons and ammunition and redistribute them to able-bodied soldiers. Adding his fire to that of his men, he assisted in eliminating a major enemy threat.\n\nSeeing another wounded comrade in front of his position, Sgt. Robinson again defied the enemy's fire to effect a rescue. In so doing he was himself wounded in the shoulder and leg. Despite his painful wounds, he dragged the soldier to shelter and saved his life by administering first aid. While patching his own wounds, he spotted an enemy machine gun which had inflicted a number of casualties on the American force. His rifle ammunition expended, he seized 2 grenades and, in an act of unsurpassed heroism, charged toward the entrenched enemy weapon. Hit again in the leg, this time with a tracer round which set fire to his clothing, Sgt. Robinson ripped the burning clothing from his body and staggered indomitably through the enemy fire, now concentrated solely on him, to within grenade range of the enemy machine gun position. Sustaining 2 additional chest wounds, he marshaled his fleeting physical strength and hurled the 2 grenades, thus destroying the enemy gun position, as he fell dead upon the battlefield.\n\nHis magnificent display of leadership and bravery saved several lives and inspired his soldiers to defeat the numerically superior enemy force. Sgt. Robinson's conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity, at the cost of his life, are in keeping with the finest traditions of the U.S. Army and reflect great credit upon the 1st Infantry Division and the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1930798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930798", "title": "Northwest Territorial Imperative", "text": "Northwest Territorial Imperative\n\nThe Northwest Territorial Imperative (often shortened to Northwest Imperative or known simply as the Northwest Front) is a white separatist, neo-Nazi idea that has been popularized since the 1970s–80s by white nationalist, white supremacist and white separatist groups within the United States. According to it, members of these groups are encouraged to relocate to a region of the Northwestern United States—Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Western Montana—with the intent to eventually declare the region an Aryan white ethnostate. Depending on who defines the project, it can also include the entire states of Montana and Wyoming, plus Northern California. White supremacist leaders Robert E. Miles, Robert Jay Mathews and Richard Butler were originally the main promoters of the idea.\n\nSeveral reasons have been given as to why this area has been chosen to be a future white homeland: it is farther removed from Black, Jewish and other minority locations than other areas of the United States are; it is geographically remote, making it hard for the federal government to uproot activists; its \"wide open spaces\" appeal to those who believe in the right to hunt and fish without any government regulations; and it also allows them to have access to seaports and Canada. The formation of such a \"White homeland\" also involves the expulsion, euphemized as a \"repatriation\", of all non-Whites from the territory. The project is variously called \"Northwest Imperative\", \"White American Bastion\", \"White Aryan Republic\", \"White Aryan Bastion\", \"White Christian Republic\", or the \"10% solution\" by its promoters.\n\nThe territory proposed by the Northwest Territorial Imperative overlaps with the territory of the Cascadia independence movement, and the two movements share similar flags, but they are otherwise unrelated.\n\nThe Oregon black exclusion laws of 1844, an attempt to expel all African Americans from the state, are cited as an early example of this racist project in the region. White supremacist journalist Derek Stenzel, the Portland-based editor of \"Northwestern Initiative,\" emphasized that the 1859 constitution of Oregon explicitly stated that \"no free negro, mulatto or Chinaman\" could reside, vote, hold contract, or make business in the state. Therefore, The project would in his view be in line with the \"high racist ideals\" of the original settlers.\n\nThe primary proponents of a separatist white homeland in America were Richard Butler (1918–2004), the leader of the Idaho-based Aryan Nations, and Robert E. Miles (1925–1992), a white supremacist theologist from Michigan. In the early 1980s, the latter introduced the idea of a territorial separation in the Northwest in \"Birth of a Nation\", where he urged whites to leave the American multicultural areas and \"go in peace\" to this region where they would remain a majority. In July 1986, the Aryan Nations Congress was organized around the theme of the \"Northwest Territorial Imperative\", and was attended by over 200 Klan and Neo-Nazi leaders, as well as 4,000–5,000 racist activists. During the Congress, Miles declared that the project could be achieved \"by White nationalists moving to the area, buying land together or adjacent to each other and having families consisting of five or ten children [...] We will win the Northwest by out-breeding our opponents and keeping our children away from the insane and destructive values of the Establishment.\" His solution of setting aside the northwestern states (10% of the contiguous US territory) for a white nation was endorsed by the Knights of the KKK from Tuscumbia and key activists moved to the area. Different from fighting within a homeland like in the Deep South though, the imperative required a large migration of white supremacists from throughout the country, and it was generally rejected by Southern extremists. The project was also advertised by the Aryan Nations Church under the name \"White Aryan Bastion\".\n\nA secondary supporter was Robert Jay Mathews (1953–1984), who lived in Metaline Falls, Washington and advocated further colonization of the area. Fearing the \"extinction of the white race\", he endorsed the creation of a \"White American Bastion\" in the Pacific Northwest. In 1983, he delivered a speech before the National Alliance, a white supremacist organization led by William Luther Pierce, calling the \"yeoman farmers and independent truckers\" to rally his project. Mathews received the only standing ovation at the conference.\n\nThe idea has been endorsed by various organizations the likes of White Aryan Resistance, Wotansvolk, the White Order of Thule, Aryan Nations and Northwestern Imperative. \n\nThe defunct Oregon-based white power skinhead organization Volksfront advocated for the Imperative, and Harold Covington (1953–2018) founded the Northwest Front to promote white migration to the region. The project was the motivation for Randy Weaver and his family to move to Idaho in the early 1980s, which led to the Ruby Ridge incident. \n\nDavid Lane, author of the Fourteen Words, mentioned the \"territorial imperative\" in his 88 Precepts.\n\n"}
{"id": "1930805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930805", "title": "Delaware Basin", "text": "Delaware Basin\n\nThe Delaware Basin is a geologic depositional and structural basin in West Texas and southern New Mexico, famous for holding large oil fields and for a fossilized reef exposed at the surface. Guadalupe Mountains National Park and Carlsbad Caverns National Park protect part of the basin. It is part of the larger Permian Basin, itself contained within the Mid-Continent oil province.\n\nBy earliest Permian time, during the Wolfcampian Epoch, the ovoid shaped subsiding Delaware Basin extended over 10,000 square miles (26,000 km²) in what is now western Texas and southeast New Mexico. This period of deposition left a thickness of 1600 to 2200 feet (490 to 670 m) of limestone interbedded with dark-colored shale.\n\nA narrow outlet that geologists call the Hovey Channel periodically supplied new seawater from the Panthalassa Ocean to the west. The somewhat smaller and shallower Midland Basin was just east and the much smaller Marfa Basin was to the southwest. All three basins were south of the equator, north of the Ouachita Mountains of mid-Texas, and part of the northern continent Laurasia. Structurally the Delaware, Midland and Marfa were foreland basins created when the Ouachita Mountains were uplifted as the southern continent Gondwana collided with Laurasia, forming the supercontinent Pangea in the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian). The Ouachita Mountains formed a rainshadow over the basins, and a warm shallow sea flooded the surrounding area. On the other side of the equator, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains formed a large mountainous island.\n\nThe Delaware Basin temporarily stopped subsiding in the Leonardian Epoch at the start of the mid-Permian. Small banks along its margin developed along with small discontinuous patch reefs in the shallow water just offshore. The first formation that resulted was the Yeso and consists of alternating beds of dolomitic limestone, gypsum, and sandstone. The sediments responsible for creating the Yeso were deposited in nearshore areas that graded into the carbonate banks of the Victorio Peak Formation in the deeper waters. Thin-bedded limestones of the Bone Spring Formation accumulated as limy ooze in the stagnant deepest part of the basin.\n\nSubsidence of the Delaware Basin restarted later in the mid Permian and by the Guadalupian Epoch of the upper Permian the patch reefs had grown larger. Sediments deposited close to the shore are now the cherty dolomites of the San Andres Formation while deposition a little further out forms the quartz sandstone and scattered patch reefs of the Brushy Canyon Formation.\n\nRapid subsidence of the basin started in the middle Guadalupian. Patch reefs responded by rapid (mostly vertical) growth, resulting in the Goat Seep Reef. Three facies developed:\n\n\nSubsidence of the basin stopped for good by the later part of the Guadalupian. Capitan Reef was the largest in the basin, and it rapidly grew 350 miles (560 km) around it. The facies were:\n\nCapitan Reef was built primarily from calcareous sponges, encrusting algae such as stromatolites, and directly from seawater as a limey mud. In stark contrast, Cenozoic (current era), Mesozoic (age of the dinosaurs), and even middle Paleozoic (well before the Permian) reefs are mainly composed of corals.\n\nSea level dropped as the late Permian glaciation intensified and locked increasing amounts of water in distant ice caps. Sedimentation continued to fill the Delaware Basin into the Ochoan Epoch of the upper Permian, periodically cutting the basin off from its source of seawater. Part of the resulting brine became the deep-water evaporites of the Castile Formation. The Castile consists of 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) thick laminae of alternating gray anhydrite and gypsum, brown calcite, and halite. As the salt concentration increased, halite and potassium-rich salt precipitated from the briny body of water on its margin and on nearshore areas. This salt layer covered an increasingly large area as the water level dropped, forming the Salado Formation.\n\nThe Delaware Basin was filled at least to the top of Capitan Reef and mostly covered by dry land before the end of the Ochoan Epoch. Rivers migrated over its surface and deposited the red silt and sand that now constitute the siltstone and sandstone of the Rustler and Dewey Lake Formations. A karst topography developed as groundwater circulated in the buried limestone formations, dissolving away caverns which were later destroyed by infill and erosion.\n\nUplift associated with the Laramide orogeny in the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic created a major fault along which the Guadalupe Mountains were thrusted into existence. The range forms the tilted upthrown part of the system and the Salt Flat Bolson forms the downfallen block. Capitan Reef limestone was exposed above the surface with the 1000-foot-high (300 m) El Capitan being its most prominent feature. Other large outcrops compose the Apache Mountains and Glass Mountains to the south.\n\nStreams eroded the softer sediment away, lowering the ground level to its current position. Acidic groundwater excavated caves in the limestone of the higher areas and eroded sediment helped fill any remaining Permian-aged caves. Unlike most other caves in limestone, in this case the acid was likely derived from hydrogen sulfide and sulfide-rich brines that were freed by tectonic activity in the mid-Tertiary and mixed with oxygenated groundwater, forming sulfuric acid. Carlsbad Caverns and nearby modern caves started to form at this time in the groundwater-saturated phreatic zone. Due to the semiarid climate, the karst topography that was created lacks the characteristic depressions, sink holes, pits, and solutional fissures on the surface. Mass wasting such as landslides further reduced topographic relief. \n\nAdditional uplift of the Guadalupe Mountains in the Pliocene and early Pleistocene epochs enlarged Carlsbad Cavern and nearby caves. Parts of the major caves emerged from the saturated phreatic zone into the vadose with temporary periods of repose during which additional solutional excavation occurred in the phreatic zone. These pauses in emergence are thought to be responsible for creating the different levels in Carlsbad Caverns. Precipitation of carbon dioxide-rich water that infiltrated into the cavern created speleothems, especially in the humid parts of the Pleistocene. Speleothems found in the \"Big Room\" of Carlsbad were dated using electron spin resonance dating and were found to be 500,000 to 600,000 years old. This indicates that the Big Room level was dry by that time.\n\nThe soft and easily eroded gypsum of the Castile Formation was removed, exposing the Guadalupe Escarpment. Additional erosion intersected the upper part of Carlsbad Cavern and other caves, forming their entrances. Drying of cave air has reduced the growth rate of speleothems and encouraged the development of nodular travertine (\"cave popcorn\").\n\n\n"}

He was the third member of the family to preside over Wildenstein & Co., one of the most successful and influential art-dealerships of the 20th century. He was once described as \"probably the richest and most powerful art dealer on earth\".\n\nWildenstein was born in Verrières-le-Buisson, Essonne, just outside Paris. He was educated at Cours Hattemer and at the University of Paris, graduating in 1938 and going on to study at the École du Louvre.\n\nWildenstein's grandfather, Nathan Wildenstein, established an art dealership on the Rue La Boétie in Paris after fleeing his native Alsace during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71. He first specialised in 18th-century French painting and sculpture, later expanding to Italian, Dutch, Flemish and Spanish art. Although he had been working in a tailor's shop when he began to trade in art he proved extremely successful, selling to European collectors such as Edmond James de Rothschild and later to Americans such as J. P. Morgan, Henry Clay Frick, and to the Kress, Rockefeller, and Mellon families. He opened a New York gallery in 1903 and one in London in 1925.\n\nThe Wildensteins gained a reputation as shrewd businessmen, stockpiling works to maximise their profits when released onto the market. Nathan built a huge inventory of European Old Master paintings, sculpture, drawings, furniture and decorative objects, to which Daniel's father, Georges, added Impressionist and Postimpressionist works. In 1978 Wildenstein & Co's New York storeroom included 20 Renoirs, 25 Courbets, 10 Van Goghs, 10 Cézannes, 10 Gauguins, 2 Botticellis, 8 Rembrandts, 8 Rubens, 9 El Grecos and 5 Tintorettos among a total inventory of 10,000 paintings. The secrecy attached to these holdings led to a great deal of interest and speculation in the art world.\n\nIn 1940 Daniel Wildenstein went to New York to work for the family firm. He had already acted as Group Secretary of the French Pavilion at the World's Fair in 1937 and as exhibitions director at the Jacquemart-Andre Museum. He took over the running of Wildenstein & Co.'s Paris and New York branches in 1959 and those in London and Buenos Aires in 1963, the year his father died. A gallery in Tokyo was added in the early 1970s. As an art dealer Wildenstein was phenomenally successful. A 1998 profile of the family in \"Vanity Fair\" magazine asserted that his wealth was estimated at more than $5 billion. \"His fortune,\" the magazine stated, \"was the only one of that magnitude ever made in the art market.\"\n\nLike his father, Daniel Wildenstein established a reputation as a scholar and art historian. He revised and enlarged the catalogues published by his father and began work on his own projects, investing in the acquisition of archival material and establishing the Wildenstein Institute to issue catalogues raisonné which became the authority for authenticating the works of major French artists. His five-volume catalogue raisonné of the work of Claude Monet was published between 1976 and 1992. His two-volumes on Édouard Manet appeared in 1976 and 1977, those on Gustave Courbet in 1977 and 1977, and a book on Paul Gauguin in 2001. He acted as editor-in-chief of the \"Gazette des Beaux-Arts\" from 1963 and in 1971 was elected a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.\n\nAlthough he officially retired in 1990, Wildenstein is reported to have maintained a close control over the running of the business. The number of Wildenstein galleries around the world shrank in his later years until it contained only two: Wildenstein & Co. and PaceWildenstein, both in New York. PaceWildenstein was established in 1993 as a joint venture with the Pace Gallery to deal in contemporary art. The collaboration came to an end in 2010.\n\nIn 1999 Wildenstein published a series of his interviews entitled \"Marchand d’Art\".\n\nWildenstein & Co reopened in Paris after the Second World War but they ended their operations there in the early 1960s after the French minister of culture, Andre Malraux, publicly accused Georges Wildenstein of bribing a ministry official to authorize the export and sale abroad of Georges de La Tour's painting \"The Fortune Teller\". The case never went to court and Daniel Wildenstein subsequently accused Malraux of being motivated by malice.\n\nMore recently Wildenstein & Co has become embroiled in a number of controversies connected with the Nazi confiscation of art works during the Second World War, and with the nature of Georges Wildenstein's relationship with the German regime at that time. In May 2000 the Wildensteins lost a court case they had brought in Paris against the art historian Héctor Feliciano, whose book, \"The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art\", suggested that although Georges Wildenstein had fled France for America in 1941, the business had continued to trade profitably with the Nazis. Daniel Wildenstein's sons sued for defamation but lost the case.\n\nIn 1997 the Wildenstein family was sued in New York by the heirs of Alphonse Kann, a prominent Jewish art collector. They claimed that eight illuminated manuscripts, dating from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries and now in the possession of Wildenstein & Co, had been looted by the Nazis in 1940. The Wildensteins asserted that the books were owned legitimately before the war, that they had been seized from their family safe in October 1940, and that they had then been recovered after the liberation of France. Daniel Wildenstein suggested that inventory markings on the manuscripts apparently connecting them to the Kann collection were of no significance and suggested that claims to ownership made after so long an interval of time had no validity.\n\nIn June 2011 Daniel's son, Guy Wildenstein, was charged by the French authorities with concealing art that had been reported as missing or stolen. The police seized 30 artworks from the vault of the Wildenstein Institute, at least 20 of which, including sculptures by the Italian artist Rembrandt Bugatti, two sketches by Edgar Degas and a pastel by Eugène Delacroix, were claimed to have been originally part of the collection of Joseph Reinach. Daniel Wildenstein had acted as executor of the estate of Reinach's daughter in 1972 and had been charged with responsibility for distributing the collection, which was held at the Wildenstein Institute, among the heirs.\n\nWildenstein was a major figure in European horse racing, a four-time winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and six times France's leading owner. His horses, many of which he bred, raced under the name of the Allez France Stables and captured many of the most important races in France, the United Kingdom and the United States. His first win in the Arc came with the filly Allez France in 1974. He won again with All Along in 1983, with Sagace the following year and with the colt Peintre Celebre, who broke the course record when winning in 1997. The homebred filly All Along was named horse of the year in France and across the Atlantic, after a series of wins in America followed her victory in the Arc. Among Wildenstein's other successful horses were Pawneese, Madelia, and Flying Water.\n\nWildenstein was a famously irascible owner. His criticism of Pat Eddery's riding of Buckskin in the Ascot Gold Cup of 1978 caused the trainer Peter Walwyn to ask Wildenstein to remove his horses from his yard. They were removed to the care of Henry Cecil, forming a partnership that had considerable success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, only for that relationship to break down in 1985 over criticism of Cecil's then stable-jockey Lester Piggott. Piggott responded by describing the Wildensteins as \"inveterate bad losers\".\n\nIn 1939, Daniel Wildenstein married Martine Kapferer, the daughter of a wealthy French Jewish family; they had two sons, Alec and Guy. The marriage was dissolved and he married secondly, in 1978, to Sylvia Roth.\n\nWildenstein died in 2001 at the age of 84 in a Paris hospital. He was survived by his wife and sons. Guy Wildenstein assumed responsibility for the art dealership while Alec Wildenstein inherited control of the family's horse racing and breeding operations.\n\nAfter his death, Wildenstein's fortune became the subject of an extended legal dispute. In 2005 the Court of Appeal in Paris ruled that Sylvia Wildenstein had been deceived into signing away her inheritance by her stepsons, who claimed that she would otherwise face huge tax bills and a possible criminal investigation. In fact Wildenstein had placed two paintings, a Fragonard and a Boucher, with the investment bank Lazard Frères to cover his estate's tax liabilities. The court ruled that Sylvia Wildenstein was entitled to half of her late husband's personal estate, much of which she claimed had disappeared into foreign trusts, and ordered her stepsons to pay 20 million euros as an advance on a fortune described by \"The New York Times\" as having been \"variously estimated from 43 million to 4 billion euros\". In 2010 Sylvia Wildenstein pursued a criminal case alleging that this tax evasion had been ignored by French ministers connected to her stepson Guy Wildenstein through his involvement with the political party the UMP.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1930814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930814", "title": "Hydrogen iodide", "text": "Hydrogen iodide\n\nHydrogen iodide () is a diatomic molecule and hydrogen halide. Aqueous solutions of HI are known as hydroiodic acid or hydriodic acid, a strong acid. Hydrogen iodide and hydroiodic acid are, however, different in that the former is a gas under standard conditions, whereas the other is an aqueous solution of the gas. They are interconvertible. HI is used in organic and inorganic synthesis as one of the primary sources of iodine and as a reducing agent.\n\nHI is a colorless gas that reacts with oxygen to give water and iodine. With moist air, HI gives a mist (or fumes) of hydroiodic acid. It is exceptionally soluble in water, giving hydroiodic acid. One liter of water will dissolve 425 liters of HI, the most concentrated solution having only four water molecules per molecule of HI.\n\nHydroiodic acid is not pure hydrogen iodide, but a mixture containing it. Commercial \"concentrated\" hydroiodic acid usually contains 48–57% HI by mass. The solution forms an azeotrope boiling at 127 °C with 57% HI, 43% water. The high acidity is caused by the dispersal of the ionic charge over the anion. The iodide ion is much larger than the other common halides, which results in the negative charge being dispersed over a large space. By contrast, a chloride ion is much smaller, meaning its negative charge is more concentrated, leading to a stronger interaction between the proton and the chloride ion. This weaker H···I interaction in HI facilitates dissociation of the proton from the anion and is the reason HI is the strongest acid of the hydrohalides.\n\nThe industrial preparation of HI involves the reaction of I with hydrazine, which also yields nitrogen gas:\n\nWhen performed in water, the HI must be distilled.\n\nHI can also be distilled from a solution of NaI or other alkali iodide in concentrated phosphoric acid (note that concentrated sulfuric acid will not work for acidifying iodides, as it will oxidize the iodide to elemental iodine).\n\nAnother way HI may be prepared is by bubbling hydrogen sulfide steam through an aqueous solution of iodine, forming hydroiodic acid (which is distilled) and elemental sulfur (this is filtered):\n\nAdditionally, HI can be prepared by simply combining H and I:\n\nThis method is usually employed to generate high-purity samples.\n\nFor many years, this reaction was considered to involve a simple bimolecular reaction between molecules of H and I. However, when a mixture of the gases is irradiated with the wavelength of light equal to the dissociation energy of I, about 578 nm, the rate increases significantly. This supports a mechanism whereby I first dissociates into 2 iodine atoms, which each attach themselves to a side of an H molecule and break the :\n\nIn the laboratory, another method involves hydrolysis of PI, the iodine equivalent of PBr. In this method, I reacts with phosphorus to create phosphorus triiodide, which then reacts with water to form HI and phosphorous acid:\n\nSolutions of hydrogen iodide are easily oxidized by air:\n\nLike HBr and HCl, HI adds to alkenes:\n\nHI is also used in organic chemistry to convert primary alcohols into alkyl halides. This reaction is an S2 substitution, in which the iodide ion replaces the \"activated\" hydroxyl group (water):\n\nHI is preferred over other hydrogen halides because the iodide ion is a much better nucleophile than bromide or chloride, so the reaction can take place at a reasonable rate without much heating. This reaction also occurs for secondary and tertiary alcohols, but substitution occurs via the S1 pathway.\n\nHI (or HBr) can also be used to cleave ethers into alkyl iodides and alcohols, in a reaction similar to the substitution of alcohols. This type of cleavage is significant because it can be used to convert a chemically stable and inert ether into more reactive species. In this example diethyl ether is split into ethanol and iodoethane:\n\nThe reaction is regioselective, as iodide tends to attack the less sterically hindered ether carbon.\n\nHI is subject to the same Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov guidelines as HCl and HBr.\n\nAlthough harsh by modern standards, HI was commonly employed as a reducing agent early on in the history of organic chemistry. Chemists in the 19th century attempted to prepare cyclohexane by HI reduction of benzene at high temperatures, but instead isolated the rearranged product, methylcyclopentane (\"see the article on\" cyclohexane). As first reported by Kiliani, hydroiodic acid reduction of sugars and other polyols results in the reductive cleavage of several or even all hydroxy groups, although often with poor yield and/or reproducibility. In the case of benzyl alcohols and alcohols with α-carbonyl groups, reduction by HI can provide synthetically useful yields of the corresponding hydrocarbon product (ROH + 2HI → RH + + I). This process can be made catalytic in HI using red phosphorus to reduce the formed I.\n\n\n"}

The village contains scattered settlements such as Ash Tree Corner, Chapel Corner, Holtwood and Irish Hill. There is a 12th-century church (St Mary's), a village hall, a Dogs Trust canine rescue kennels and the Organic Research Centre at Elm Farm. The White Hart, Hamstead Marshall's pub for several centuries, closed in 2014. The owner has had two planning applications (to turn it into four dwellings) turned down. Following the second refusal, the owner appealed to the Planning Inspectorate, but this appeal was refused in June 2018.

{"id": "1930857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930857", "title": "Makhanda, Eastern Cape", "text": "Makhanda, Eastern Cape\n\nMakhanda (English Grahamstown; , ) is a town of about 70,000 people in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It is situated about northeast of Port Elizabeth and southwest of East London. Makhanda is the largest town in the Makana Local Municipality, and the seat of the municipal council. It also hosts Rhodes University, the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, The South African Library for the Blind (SALB) and a diocese of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa and 6 South African Infantry Battalion.\n\nThe town's name change from Grahamstown to Makhanda was officially gazetted on 29 June 2018. The town was officially renamed to Makhanda in memory of Xhosa warrior and prophet Makhanda ka Nxele.\n\nGrahamstown was founded in 1812 as a military outpost by Lieutenant-Colonel John Graham as part of the effort to secure the eastern frontier of British influence in the Cape Colony against the Xhosa, who had been forcibly pushed out to the lands that lay just to the east on the Fish River. The brutal expulsion of some 20,000 Xhosa people, including their leader Ndlambe ka Rharhabe, from the Zuurveld and the adoption of a \"scorched earth\" tactic by Graham and his forces to destroy Xhosa crops to prevent their return was part of the 4th \"Frontier\" War.\n\nOn 22 April 1819, a large number of Xhosa warriors, under the leadership of Nxele (or Makana), launched an attack against the British colonial forces. The Xhosas had warned Colonel Willshire, the commanding officer, of their planned attack on Grahamstown. It was one of countless attacks launched on the nascent colony by the Xhosas. During the course of the battle, the British were running low on ammunition. A woman, by the name of Elizabeth Salt, risked her life by walking into the battle carrying weapons and ammunition to the British troops. She disguised the weapons and ammunition as an infant whom she was cradling. The Xhosa warriors were reluctant to attack a woman and child and so allowed her to pass and resupply the troops . The Xhosas, with a force of 10,000 troops under the overall command of Ndlambe's warrior son Mdushane, were unable to overpower the colonial garrison of some 300 men. Nxele surrendered, was taken captive and imprisoned on Robben Island. On Christmas Day, 1819 he tried to escape, and drowned.\n\nGrahamstown grew during the 1820s as many 1820 Settlers and their families left farming to establish themselves in more secure trades. In 1833, Grahamstown was described as having \"two or three English merchants of considerable wealth, but scarcely any society in the ordinary sense of the word. The Public Library is a wretched affair\". As of 1833, it was estimated that the population of Grahamstown was approximately 6,000. In a few decades it became the Cape Colony's largest town after Cape Town. It became a bishopric in 1852. It was traditionally the capital and cultural centre of the Albany area, a former traditionally English-speaking district with a distinctive local culture.\n\nIn 1872, the Cape Government Railways began construction of the railway line linking Grahamstown to Port Alfred on the coast, and to the developing national railway network inland. That was completed and opened on 3 September 1879.\n\nGrahamstown was the location of the testing of the first diamond find by Henry Carter Galpin.\n\nIn 1904, Rhodes University College was established in Grahamstown through a grant from the Rhodes Trust. In 1951 it became a fully-fledged University, Rhodes University.\n\nArts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa announced the name change from Grahamstown in the Government Gazette no. 641 of 29 June 2018. The purpose of gazetting was to publicise the Minister's decision for objections or comments by 28 July 2018.\n\nPrompted by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendation that geographic features, including geographical names, be renamed as a \"symbolic reparation\" to address an unjust past, it is proposed that the town be renamed after Makhanda, the prophet, philosopher and military man, who led a failed attack against the British garrison in Grahamstown in 1819. On 2 October 2018, Grahamstown was officially renamed to Makhanda in memory of Makhanda ka Nxele.\n\nSt. Michael and St. George Cathedral is the seat of the Anglican Diocese of Grahamstown. Makhanda also has Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Ethiopian Episcopal, Methodist, Baptist, Pinkster Protestante, Dutch Reformed (Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk), Charismatic, Apostolic and Pentecostal churches. There are also meeting places for Hindus, Scientologists, Quakers, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Muslims.\n\nFor historic reasons, particularly the vibrancy of evangelism during Grahamstown's heyday, the City is home to more than forty religious buildings, and the nickname the \"City of Saints\" has become attached to the town. However, there is another story which may be the source of this nickname.\n\nIt is said that in about 1846 there were Royal Engineers stationed in Grahamstown who were in need of building tools. They sent a message to Cape Town requesting a vice to be forwarded to them from the Ordnance Stores. A reply came back, 'Buy vice locally'. The response was, \"No vice in Grahamstown\".\n\nAccording to the 2011 census the population of Makhanda was 67,264, of whom 78.9% described themselves as \"Black African\", 11.3% as \"Coloured\" and 8.4% as \"White\". Since 1994, there has been a considerable influx of Black people from the former Ciskei Xhosa homeland, which lies just to the east. The first language of 72.2% of the population is Xhosa, while 13.7% speak Afrikaans and 10.8% speak English\n\nMakhanda is home to many schools, Rhodes University, and several institutes, most importantly the South African National Library for the Blind, the National English Literary Museum, the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (formerly the JLB Smith Institute), the International Library of African Music (ILAM), the Albany Museum (which includes a local history museum, a natural history museum and the observatory museum (see below), and the Institute for the Study of English in Africa.\n\nThe legacy of disparate education during Apartheid still echoes in the provision of secondary education in this former frontier town, where significant discrepancies in matric pass rates and general quality of education exist. Addressing this problem is one of the town's greatest challenges.\n\nIn March 1984 the City of Grahamstown adopted a flag, one of six designs prepared by heraldic expert Prof. Hugh Smith, of Rhodes University.\n\nIn 1859, Henry Carter Galpin bought a simple double-storey establishment in Bathurst Street for £300. During the next 23 years he made extensive changes. The front was elegantly decorated, and a basement and three floors added to the back. Rooftop developments included an observatory, from which the building took its name, and what was for many years the only Camera Obscura in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nBorn in 1820 in Dorset, England, Galpin trained as an architect, surveyor and civil engineer, as well as a chronometer, clock and watchmaker. These skills, together with his keen interest in optics and astronomy, are reflected throughout The Observatory- the most unusual Victorian home and business premises in South Africa.\n\nGalpin's thriving watchmaker and jeweller's shop was run by three of his seven sons after his death in 1886, including Ernest Edward Galpin. They sold to Messrs Leader and Krummeck in 1939. Several businesses occupied the ground floor while the basement and upper floors were divided into flats and lodgings.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s the structure was dilapidated and unsound. The historic link with the identification of the Eureka diamond led to the purchase and restoration of the Observatory by De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited.\n\nThe building has been proclaimed a National Monument and presented to the Albany Museum to form part of its History Division. Exhibits were arranged, and the Observatory Museum was opened by Mr. Harry F. Oppenheimer, the then Chairman of De Beers, on 2 February 1983.\n\nThe following is a list of tower clocks in Makhanda, with their location and if they are in working order.\n\n\nTwo large festivals take place annually in Makhanda: the National Arts Festival in June/July and SciFest Africa in the first term of the year and attracts some 50,000 people. The National Arts Festival is the largest Arts festival in Africa and sees some of the leading talent on the South African and international art scene arriving in Makhanda for a celebration of culture and artistic expression. South Africa's National Science Festival, was established in 1996 to promote the public awareness, understanding and appreciation of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and innovation. Makhanda is also host to the Puku Story Festival since 2013 presented by the Puku Children's Literature Foundation. The festival was created in partnership with the National Arts Festival and the African Studies Department at Rhodes University with the aim to facilitate access to literature and educational/recreational materials in Xhosa.\n\nMakhanda is home to the oldest surviving independent newspaper in South Africa. \"Grocott's Mail\" was founded in 1870 by the Grocott family, and bought out a newspaper called the \"Grahamstown Journal\", which was founded in 1831. Robert Godlonton, a previous owner of the \"Journal\" had used it and his other papers to oppose Andries Stockenström's treaty system and advocated seizing more land from the Xhosa. It is now a local newspaper operated by the Rhodes University School of Journalism and Media Studies, and still retains its name.\n\nAs a major centre for journalism training, Rhodes University also hosts two student newspapers, \"Activate\", established in 1947, and \"The Oppidan Press\", a student initiative launched in 2007 that caters mainly to the student population living off-campus.\n\nWith the establishment of the Union of South Africa the Grahamstown High Court became a Local Division of the newly formed Supreme Court of South Africa (under Cape Town). On 28 June 1957, the Eastern Districts Court, under the name Eastern Cape Division, became a provincial division. In certain other areas of provincial government Grahamstown similarly served as a centre for the Eastern Cape.\n\nIn 1994 Grahamstown became part of the newly established Eastern Cape Province, while Bhisho was chosen as the provincial capital.\n\nIt is the seat of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, as well as the Magistrate's Court for the Albany District. As a result of the presence of a High Court, several other related organs of state such as a Masters Office and a Director of Public Prosecutions are present in the town.\nA few other Government (mostly provincial) departments maintain branches or other offices in Makhanda.\n\nGrahamstown was the only settlement outside Cape Town to host a sitting of the Cape Colony legislature (a move to defuse a call for the creation of a separate colony).\n\nGrahamstown had its own municipality until 2000. Since then, it has formed part of the Makana Local Municipality in the Cacadu District.\n\nFrom 2012 the Makana Local Municipality was unable to reliably provide water to its citizens The crisis continued to grow during 2013.\n\nIn 2013 South Africa's minister of water Edna Molewa was tasked with restoring the water supply of Grahamstown following protests over a nine-day water outage. Causes for the outage include financial mismanagement, with under-spending on infrastructure. The task force established by Molewa had not solved the problem by 2014.\n\nIn October 2015 more than 500 people were displaced and more than 300 shops looted during a wave of xenophobic violence.\n\nSome people use traditional African medicine because it is believed to be effective. There are some plants which are popular with the people of Makhanda.\n\nMunicipality (1) — The first arms were assumed in September 1862. They quartered an incorrect version of the arms of Graham of Fintry with those of Jan van Riebeeck (in incorrect colours), with an ostrich as a crest. The supporters were a leopard and a giraffe, and the motto was \"Virtute et opera\".\n\nMunicipality (2) — In response to a call by the Cape Provincial Administration for municipalities to have their coats of arms checked and, if necessary, re-designed, the city council had a new coat of arms designed by Ivan Mitford-Barberton and H. Ellis Tomlinson in 1950. It was granted by the College of Arms on 20 July 1950, and registered at the Bureau of Heraldry in September 1994.\n\nThe new arms were : \"Or, on a pile Gules, three annulets placed 2 and 1 Or; on a chief Sable, three escallops Or\" (in layman's terms : a golden shield displaying, from top to bottom, three golden scallop shells on a black horizontal stripe, and three golden rings on a red triangle). The crest was changed to a plume of ostrich feathers issuing from a golden mural crown, and the supporters were differenced by placing an escallop on each shoulder.\n\nIn 2017, Makana Revive! an independent civil society organisation was formed. During the first quarter of 2018, Makana Revive made national news when it spearheaded an initiative to repair failing infrastructure and improve the security and hygiene in the CBD. Donations were received from both local and international citizens and alumni.\n\nThe South African Unemployed Peoples' Movement has a strong presence in Makhanda.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The village is above sea level on a ridge aligned east – west in the Berkshire Downs. It is the highest village in Berkshire.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics no longer publishes Farnborough's population total separately. For the 2011 Census the ONS grouped Farnborough with its smaller neighbour Catmore. It recorded the combined population of the two parishes as 102. But Farnborough remains a separate civil parish, governed by its own parish meeting.\n\nFarnborough parish comprises of chalk downland. Due to the porosity of the chalk and the village's hilltop position, the only supplies of groundwater are at great depth. The parish's lowest point is east of the village, above sea level.\n\nSince the 1974 boundary changes, the northern boundary of the parish has formed part of Berkshire's county boundary with Oxfordshire. The B4494 road linking Wantage and Newbury passes about west of the village, forming part of the western boundary of the parish.\n\nFarnborough's toponym is derived from Old English and means \"fern-clad hills\". In this case \"borough\" is derived from \"beorg\", meaning a mountain, hill or tumulus, and not from \"burh\", a fortified settlement.\n\nA 9th-century document records the manor as \"Feornberge\". It appears as \"Fearnbeorgan\" in the \"Cartularium Saxonicum\" in records from AD 916 and 931. Other 10th-century documents record it as \"Fearnbornthaen\", \"Fearbeorh\", and \"Feornbeorh\". The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as \"Fermeberge\". Another 11th-century document records it as \"Fernbeorngan\". Later forms include \"Fernbergam\" in the 12th century and \"Fearnberughe\", \"Ferenburgh\" and \"Farnberg\" in the 13th century.\n\nAbingdon Abbey seems to have held the manor from the 9th century. In 1538 it surrendered its estates the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1540 the Crown granted the manor to Edward Fettiplace, whose family held several manors in Berkshire. But in 1542 Fettiplace sold Farnborough to a John Wynchcombe of Newbury, whose heirs held the manor until it was sold in 1671. It then descended through the Jennett, Raymond and Craven families until the late 18th century, when a Fulwar Craven sold it to the Rev. William Wroughton. It was still held by a member of the Wroughton family early in the 1920s.\n\nThe earliest parts of the Church of England parish church of All Saints are 11th-century and include the Norman nave and north doorway. The chancel has a 13th-century piscina. The church was altered in the 14th century and the west tower is Perpendicular Gothic, possibly 15th-century.\n\nThe building was restored in 1883 and 1885, which involved reroofing, new windows, widening the chancel arch, adding buttresses to the nave and building or rebuilding the south porch. One window has stained glass made by John Piper and Joseph Nuttgens in 1986 in memory of poet John Betjeman, who lived at the Old Rectory from 1945 to 1951. Piper and Betjeman were friends who worked together on the \"Shell Guides\". The window shows a tree of life flanked by fish on one side and butterflies on the other, intended to symbolise the resurrection.\n\nThe west tower has a ring of five bells. The foundry at Wokingham cast the third and tenor bells in about 1499. Edward Read of Aldbourne in Wiltshire cast the fourth bell in 1753. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the second bell in 1927 and the treble bell in 1937. All Saints has two Sanctus bells: one cast in about 1599 and the other cast in about 1799. The 1799 Sanctus bell is unringable.\n\nAll Saints is a Grade I listed building.\n\nThe village is on a former packhorse route between Hungerford and Oxford \"via\" Abingdon-on-Thames. In the 18th century the route was diverted. A continuation of the route is evident near East Hendred. The parish's common lands were inclosed in 1777.\n\nIn 1848 Samuel Lewis recorded that the major part of the parish was sheep pasture. He noted too the parish population was 204, presumably drawing on the 1841 Census. That is about double the parish's population in the early 21st century.\n\nThe Old Rectory is a Georgian house built in 1749 of grey brick with red brick dressings. From 1945 to 1951 it was the home of John Betjeman, who later was made Poet Laureate and knighted.\n\n"}

As the day of the match grew closer, Thompson became increasingly nostalgic. At the end, he did not go for the match, but sat at home and wrote \"At Lord's\". The original match in 1878 ended in a draw, with Gloucestershire needing 111 to win with five wickets in hand, Grace 58*.\n\nThe first stanza of the poem has contributed the titles of at least three books on cricket:\n\nThe first stanza is also quoted in full by Count Bronowsky in Paul Scott's Raj Quartet novel \"The Day of the Scorpion\".\n\nThe satirical magazine \"Punch\" printed the following poem following a particularly slow and boring innings by William Scotton.

Of Jack Hobbs' County Championship debut he wrote:\n\nAt Lord's in 1950, West Indies defeated England in England for the first time. Egbert Moore, who sang under the pseudonym Lord Beginner, popularized the most famous of cricketing calypsos to celebrate the occasion. He was accompanied by Calypso Rhythm Kings, \"supervision\" by Denis Preston. It was recorded on the Melodisc (1133) label (MEL 20). The song was originally composed by Lord Kitchener.\n\n\"The Victory Calypso\" also immortalised the spin bowling pair of Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine. The calypso begins thus:\n\nChorus: With those two little pals of mine\n\nTyson taught them a lesson that can't be forgotten,\nTyson taught them a lesson that can't be forgotten,\nWe began quietly, but we came back with victory,\nGood captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.\n\nAustralia's tragedy, it began at Sydney,\nMagnificent Tyson, had their batsmen beaten,\nHe went on to give us, a victory for Christmas,\nGood captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.\n\nMore shocks for Australia, the Melbourne disaster,\nAs Favell got going, his wicket went tumbling,\nWe got them out cheaply, and score second victory,\nGood captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.\n\nThe bowling was so good, it remind them of Larwood,\nMagnificent Tyson finished with seven for twenty-seven,\nThey had no excuses, we regained the Ashes,\nGood captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.\n\nLord Relator (born Willard Harris) wrote the \"Gavaskar Calypso\" to celebrate Gavaskar’s first Test series, in West Indies in 1970–71. This was voted at No. 68 at a \"Calypso of the Century\" poll (although \"Victory Calypso\" did not feature in the list).\n\nThe most famous part of the \"Gavaskar Calypso\" is the one that describes how he batted \"like a wall\":\n\nCricket features, albeit briefly, in late-Victorian poet A.

The motto of the party is \"\"For a Strong Bulgaria in Unified Europe\"\".\n\nKostov resigned as chairman of the United Democratic Forces after a painful election defeat in June 2001 to Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha's newly established National Movement for Simeon II. The UDF had suffered heavily from allegations of corruption and increased unemployment after having carried out economic reforms during its four-year term.\n\nWith time 29 (out of 51) UDF MPs including Kostov grew increasingly dissatisfied with the new UDF leadership of chairwoman Nadezhda Mihailova, who was the foreign minister in Kostov's own government. Following another defeat for the UDF in the 2003 local elections and after Nadezhda Mihailova's refusal to bear the responsibility and resign, the group of 29 around Kostov announced their departure from the UDF and the formation of a new political force, the DSB.\n\nDSB is a member of the European People's Party (EPP).\n\nOn 30 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, the Sofia City Council members from Democratic Bulgaria, a coalition Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria is part of, proposed a package of measures in defense of local economy. Those included ten-fold tax cut for landlords for leasing an apartment, rent-free period for businesses renting municipal property for the duration of the national emergency, and reorganization of Sofia public transport in view of the reduced passenger flow.\n\nIt was chaired by Ivan Kostov since its establishment in May 2004 until June 2013. Since then it has been chaired by Radan Kanev.\n\nAt the last legislative elections, 25 June 2005, DSB won 7.0% of the popular vote and 17 out of 240 seats, their support coming mainly from big cities (appr. 18% of voters in Sofia). See also 2005 Bulgarian parliamentary election\n\nThe DSB candidate for Mayor of Sofia, former finance minister and head of the Central Bank of Bulgaria Svetoslav Gavriyski arrived third in the first round with 18% of the votes.\n\nThe last political surveys (March'2006) show the serious decreasing of the people support for the Kostov's party. Less than only 4% of the political support moves today this party to a position behind BSP (socialists), ATAKA (nationalists party), NDSV (Simeon II former king party) and UDF.\n\nThe DSB define themselves as a moderately conservative, but also nationally oriented party.\n\nThey regard themselves as successors of the ruling mandate of the United Democratic Forces (1997–2001) and promise to stand up for its achievements and build on them.\n\nThe party stands for a new structure, composition and organization of the constitutional powers in Bulgaria through the adoption of a new Constitution.\n\nThey propose a decrease in overall taxes, the creation of an investor-friendly tax and insurance environment and tax and insurance incentives to small and medium-sized enterprises and to companies that generate long-term employment. The DSB propose to reform the law enforcement institutions in order to cut off their connection with the criminal world and in order to abolish corruption. They also insist on making officials of the executive and the other branches of power fully accountable for their actions stripping them of their immunity.\n\nThey support the independence and public nature of the National Health Insurance Fund, the promotion of additional health insurance schemes through optional funds and competition between these funds.\n\nThe DSB stand for integration and coexistence of different ethnic communities on the basis of equality before the Law, regardless of religion, gender and origin and strongly oppose Ahmed Dogan, the leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms claiming that his \"Bulgarian Ethnic Model\" is one of separation and encapsulation of Bulgarian Turks, aimed at monopolizing their vote instead of integrating them in Bulgarian society. This opposition has often been wrongly referred to as anti-minority nationalism.\n\nKostov and the DSB are outspoken opponents of the Bulgarian Socialist Party whom they regard as the heir to the totalitarian Bulgarian Communist Party and define them as their main political enemy. They have also often criticized ex-Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha for allying himself with the socialists and who is accused, very much like Kostov was, of corruption.\n\nKostov's government was the one to begin adhesion talks with the European Union back in 1999 and the DSB continue to support European orientation for the country.\n\nBefore the elections of June 2005 Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria issued the Treaty for a Strong Bulgaria which is a 12-point resume of their program.\n\n"}

Little is known of the old Norwegian regalia which have since been lost and the majority of items date from 1818 and were made for the coronation of Jean Bernadotte as King Carl III Johan.\n\nThe Norwegian royal regalia include nine items: the king's crown, the sword of the realm, the king's sceptre, the king's orb, the queen's crown, the queen's sceptre, the queen's orb, the crown of the crown prince and the anointing horn. Also in this collection are several mantles, two banners of the realm and coronation thrones.\n\nThe last king and queen in Norway to be crowned were Haakon VII and his wife Maud of Wales in 1905. Thereafter, the regalia have since not been used to physically crown or to be worn by successive monarchs. Certain items are still used occasionally such as during the monarch's consecration, where the crown is displayed; or during the monarch's funeral service, where it is placed atop the casket.\n\nDuring Norway's union with Denmark, the king underwent a coronation ceremony in Denmark. When this union was dissolved in 1814, Norway declared its independence and adopted its own constitution. However, total independence was short-lived as Norway would be compelled to enter into a personal union with Sweden and sharing the same monarch and foreign policy.\n\nA coronation was required among the provisions in Norway's 1814 constitution. The old Norwegian regalia had been lost and no Norwegian regalia was available for use when preparations were made for the coronation of King Carl Johan in 1818. The king would pay for the essential regalia himself. The regalia of the king and the anointing horn were made for this coronation. The regalia of the queen were acquired in 1830 for the planned coronation of Carl Johan's wife, Désirée Clary. This coronation never took place. All the regalia were made in Sweden except the crown of the crown prince which was made in Norway in 1848 and the sword of state which was a gift from Charles John to the Norwegian state. The coronet of the crown prince was ordered for use in the planned coronation of Oscar I and Josephine of Leuchtenberg, as the Norwegian parliament wanted the heir apparent to the throne, the future Charles IV to take part in the ceremony. However Oscar I was never to be crowned in Norway because the bishop of Nidaros refused to crown the Catholic Josephine. The sword of state was initially a gift from Napoleon Bonaparte to Charles III John, then known as Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, when he was appointed Marshal of France. Charles III John carried the sword during the Battle of Leipzig; when he acquired the Norwegian regalia in 1818, he had the blade of the sword refashioned, in order that its symbolic language might correspond better to its new function.\n\nThe coronation that followed Charles III John's was that of Charles IV and his wife, Louise of the Netherlands, in 1860. Oscar II and Sophie of Nassau were crowned in 1873.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905, Norway elected a Danish prince to serve as its own king. King Haakon VII, his wife Maud, and their son Olav arrived in Norway on 25 November and Haakon took the required oath as King two days later. As required by the constitution, Haakon (along with his wife) was subsequently crowned and anointed the following year on 22 June 1906 at the Nidaros Cathedral in Tro dheim. This was the last time the regalia were to be used for a coronation as the provision in the Norwegian constitution requiring the monarch's coronation was repealed in 1908. The coronet of the crown prince has never been used: Crown Prince Olav was too young to participate in the ceremony in 1906.\n\nThe regalia are now on display in the Archbishop's Palace, next to the Nidaros Cathedral. Certain items from the regalia collection are still used occasionally such as during the monarch's consecration, where the crown is displayed; or during the monarch's funeral service, where it is placed atop the casket.\n\nIn 2006, Harald V made a speech where he emphasised that the Norwegian Crown symbolises a free, independent and democratic nation.\n\n\n\n"}

Many different phosphides are known, with widely differing structures. Most commonly encountered on the binary phosphides, i.e. those materials consisting only of phosphorus and a less electronegative element. Numerous are polyphosphides, which are solids consisting of anionic chains or clusters of phosphorus. Phosphides are known with the majority of less electronegative elements with the exception of Hg, Pb, Sb, Bi, Te, and Po. Finally, some phosphides are molecular.\n\nExamples of group 1 include . Notable examples include aluminium phosphide , zinc phosphide , calcium phosphide exploiting their tendency to release toxic phosphine upon hydrolysis. Magnesium phosphide (MgP) also is moisture sensitive. Indium phosphide (InP) and GaP are used as a semi-conductors, often in combination of related arsenides. Copper phosphide (CuP) illustrates a rare stoichiometry for a phosphide. These species are insoluble in all solvents - they are 3-dimensional solid state polymers. For those with electropositive metals, the materials hydrolyze:\nPolyphosphides contain P-P bonds. The simplest polyphosphides contain ions;. Others contain the cluster ions and polymeric chain anions (e.g. the helical ion) and complex sheet or 3-D anions. The range of structures is extensive. Potassium has nine phosphides: KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP, KP. Eight mono- and polyphosphides of nickel also exist: (NiP, NiP, NiP, NiP, NiP, NiP, NiP, NiP).\n\nTwo polyphosphide ions, found in and found in KP, are radical anions with an odd number of valence electrons making both compounds paramagnetic.\n\nThere are many ways to prepare phosphide compounds. One common way involves heating a metal and red phosphorus (P) under inert atmospheric conditions or vacuum. In principle, all metal phosphides and polyphosphides can be synthesized from elemental phosphorus and the respective metal element in stoichiometric forms. However, the synthesis is complicated due to several problems. The exothermic reactions are often explosive due to local overheating. Oxidized metals, or even just an oxidized layer on the exterior of the metal, causes extreme and unacceptably high temperatures for beginning phosphorination. Hydrothermal reactions to generate nickel phosphides have produced pure and well crystallized nickel phosphide compounds, NiP and NiP. These compounds were synthesized through a solid-liquid reaction between NiCl∙12HO and red phosphorus at 200 °C for 24 and 48 hours, respectively.\n\nMetal phosphides are also produced by reaction of tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine with metal halides. In this method, the halide is liberated as the volatile trimethylsilyl chloride.\n\nCompounds with triple bonds between a metal and phosphorus are rare. The main examples have the formula Mo(P)(NR), where R is a bulky organic substituent.\n\nMany organophosphides are known. Common examples have the formular RPM where R is an organic substituent and M is a metal. One example is lithium diphenylphosphide. The Zintl cluster is obtained with diverse alkali metal derivatives.\n\nThe mineral Schreibersite (Fe,Ni)P is common in some meteorites.\n"}

It is owned and operated by the South Carolina Educational Television Commission, an agency of the state government which holds the licenses for all of the PBS member stations licensed in the state. The broadcast signals of the eleven television stations cover almost all of the state, as well as parts of North Carolina and Georgia.\n\nThe network's primary operations are located on George Rogers Boulevard in Columbia, across from Williams-Brice Stadium on the campus of the University of South Carolina; SCETV operates satellite studios in Spartanburg, Sumter and Rock Hill.\n\nThe state network began in 1957, after the South Carolina General Assembly authorized a study in the use of instructional television in the state's public schools. A studio was opened in the library of Dreher High School in Columbia. The first telecourses (a French course taught by Madame Lucille Turney-High and a geometry course taught by Cornelia Turnbull) aired on September 8, 1958 via closed circuit television. By action of the South Carolina General Assembly, The South Carolina ETV Commission was created as a state agency and began operations on July 1, 1960, and by 1962 it extended closed-circuit, classroom television service to all 46 South Carolina counties.\n\nIn 1963, the Commission launched the first open-circuit (broadcast) educational station in South Carolina, WNTV in Greenville. One year later, WITV in Charleston signed on. Two years later, WRLK-TV in Columbia, made its debut. The network grew to eleven television transmitters covering all of the state. After years of receiving NET and PBS programs on tape delay, it entered PBS' satellite network in 1978. In 2000, SCETV broadcast the first digital television program in the state. Since 2003, the state network identifies on-air as simply \"ETV.\"\nThe Commission entered public radio in 1972, when WEPR in Clemson signed on the air (WEPR later moved its city of license to Greenville). The state radio network eventually expanded to eight stations and was called the South Carolina Educational Radio Network (SCERN) until 2003, when it was renamed ETV Radio. While \"ETV\" generally refers to television, SCETV viewed \"ETV\" as a general brand name for both its radio and television properties. In 2015, however, the radio network rebranded as South Carolina Public Radio.\n\nR. Lynn Kalmbach was selected as the network's project director in 1958 and led it until his death in 1965. Henry J. Cauthen became ETV's president and general manager and served in numerous leadership roles developing American public broadcasting, including chair of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). Cauthen retired in 1997. Paul Amos took the helm as ETV's third president in 1998 until his death in 2000. Maurice \"Moss\" Bresnahan joined ETV as president and CEO from 2001 to 2008. David Crouch served as interim president in 2009. Linda O'Bryon served as president from 2010 to 2017. Anthony Padgett is the current president and CEO.\n\nDespite the DTV Delay Act national transition extension to June 12, 2009, SCETV discontinued the analog signals of its 11 full-power stations February 18, 2009.\n\nEach station's post-transition digital allocations and the FCC Repack Plan (2017) are as follows:\n\nOn April 13, 2017, the FCC identified SCETV will be compensated $43.2 million to have WRET-TV go off-the-air as part of the Spectrum auction. WRET will relinquish RF 43 and go into a channel sharing arrangement with WNTV, starting on January 23, 2018. On August 30, 2017, PBS Kids was added on new subchannel .4 and online.\n\nOn October 31, 2017, SCETV submitted an application to change the digital terrestrial signal of WITV from channel 7 (VHF) to channel 24 (UHF); the changeover is scheduled to take place between May and July 2020.\n\nThere are nine members of the ETV Commission. Eight are appointed by the Governor for six-year terms—one from each Congressional District and one from the State at-large who serves as Chairman. The ninth member is the State Superintendent of Education who is ex-officio.\n\nSCETV's television network consists of 11 digital transmitters that cover almost all of South Carolina, as well as eastern portions of Georgia (including Augusta and Savannah) and southern portions of North Carolina (including Charlotte and Asheville). SCETV's headquarters and main production facility is located in Columbia, with production facilities in Rock Hill, Spartanburg and Sumter.\n\nSCETV initially planned to make all eleven of its television stations capable of airing local programming. Four full-fledged stations were built and staffed in Beaufort, Rock Hill, Spartanburg and Sumter before the idea was abandoned in the early 1980s. After a massive reduction in force in 2004, the stations were downgraded to production facilities. In 2012, WJWJ-TV in Beaufort was converted into a repeater of the network.\n\nThe original plan was for each station to carry callsigns of the form WxTV, but after WNTV and WITV signed on it was determined that there were not enough such callsigns available. Beginning with the third station, WRLK-TV in Columbia, most of the remaining callsigns represent prominent officials who either supported SCETV or represented the station's coverage area.\nThe SCETV stations are:\nNotes:\n\nSCETV offers four digital television services available over-the-air, and through the digital tiers of some cable television providers. ETV HD is the primary feed with high definition content from PBS and SCETV broadcast in the 1080i resolution format. The South Carolina Channel (SCC) carries the national Create service daily, with regionally produced documentary programs focusing on the Carolinas airing during the evening hours. ETV World (ETVW) provides live newscasts from Europe, notably from Germany's Deutsche Welle and the United Kingdom's BBC television networks, along with live coverage from the South Carolina State House. SCETV PBS Kids is the fourth channel, a 24/7 service also available online. SCC, ETVW and ETVK are transmitted in 480i standard definition. \n\nSCETV's television network is carried on nearly every cable television provider in South Carolina. Additionally, Rock Hill's WNSC-TV is carried on Charter Spectrum's systems on the North Carolina side of the Charlotte market.\n\nOn DirecTV and Dish Network, WRLK-TV, WNTV, WITV, WNSC-TV, WJWJ-TV, WEBA-TV and WJPM-TV are respectively carried on the Columbia, Greenville/Spartanburg/Asheville, Charleston, Charlotte, Savannah, Augusta and Florence/Myrtle Beach local feeds. The South Carolina Channel, ETV World and SCETV PBS Kids have yet to be offered by satellite services.\n\n\nHistorical: (partial)\n\n"}

{"id": "1930917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930917", "title": "Free clinic", "text": "Free clinic\n\nA free clinic or walk in clinic is a health care facility in the United States offering services to economically disadvantaged individuals for free or at a nominal cost. The need for such a clinic arises in societies where there is no universal healthcare, and therefore a social safety net has arisen in its place. Core staff members may hold full-time paid positions, however, most of the staff a patient will encounter are volunteers drawn from the local medical community.\n\nFree clinics are non-profit facilities, funded by government or private donors, that provide primary, preventive, and additional health services to the medically underserved. Regardless of insurance coverage, all individuals can receive health services from free clinics. However, said services are intended for persons with limited incomes, no health insurance, and/or who do not qualify for Medicaid and Medicare. Also included are underinsured individuals; meaning those who have only limited medical coverage (such as catastrophic care coverage, but not regular coverage), or who have insurance, but their policies include high medical deductibles that they are unable to afford. To offset costs, some clinics charge a nominal fee to those whose income is deemed sufficient to pay a fee. Clinics often use the term \"underinsured\" to describe the working poor.\n\nMost free clinics provide treatment for routine illness or injuries; and long-term chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma and high cholesterol. Many also provide a limited range of medical testing, prescription drug assistance, women's health care, and dental care. Free clinics do not function as emergency care providers, and most do not handle employment related injuries. Few, if any, free clinics offer care for chronic pain as that would require them to dispense narcotics. For a free clinic such care is almost always cost-prohibitive. Handling narcotics requires a high level of physical security for the staff and building along with more paperwork and government regulation compared to what other prescription medications require.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, healthcare in the United States became privatized despite many efforts by President Roosevelt and others to establish national health insurance, causing the healthcare system to neglect the lower classes. Starting in the 1950s, there have been incremental reforms to offset healthcare market failures and to better deliver healthcare services to low-income and underserved populations, including Medicaid and Medicare. Since then, there have still been increasing inequality and issues in coverage, access, cost, and quality of healthcare in America. In the United States, free clinics are a way to address this inequality and lack of universal healthcare, and as part of a health safety net.\n\nThe modern concept of a free clinic originated in San Francisco when Dr. David Smith founded the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic in 1967. From there free clinics spread to other California cities and then across the United States. Free clinics were originally started in the 1960s and 1970s to provide drug treatments. Each one offered a unique set of services, reflecting the particular needs and resources of the local community. Some were established to provide medical services in the inner cities while others opened in the suburbs and many student-run free clinics have emerged that serve the underserved as well as provide a medical training site for students in the health professions. What they share in common is that care is made possible through the service of volunteers, the donation of goods and community support. There is little – if any – government funding for most free clinics, so a free clinic's chances of success is largely determined by the support it receives from its own community.\n\nIn 2001 the National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics (NAFC) was founded in Washington, D.C. to advocate for the issues and concerns of free and charitable clinics. Free clinics are defined by the NAFC as \"safety-net health care organizations that utilize a volunteer/staff model to provide a range of medical, dental, pharmacy, vision and/or behavioral health services to economically disadvantaged individuals. Such clinics are 501(c)3 tax-exempt organizations, or operate as a program component or affiliate of a 501(c)(3) organization.\" In time various state and regional organizations where formed including the Free Clinics of the Great Lakes Region, Texas Association of Charitable Clinic (TXACC), North Carolina Association of Free Clinics, Ohio Association of Free Clinics and the Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics (est. 1993). In 2005 Empowering Community Healthcare Outreach (ECHO) was established to assist churches and other community organizations start and run free and charitable clinics.\n\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed as a reform that aimed to make healthcare insurance more accessible to low and middle class families.Specifically, it subsidized low-income populations’ purchase of individual coverage. It also incentivized employers to provide coverage to low-income employees, and made it mandatory for states to expand Medicaid to include non-disabled and young people with incomes that were below 138% of the federal poverty line. Studies show the ACA has been successful in redressing inequality in the access to healthcare. In 2015, there was a “4.2 percentage point increase in full-year insurance for the poor and 5.3 point increase for the near-poor”.\n\nHowever, the implementation of the ACA proved to be more challenging as some states chose not to enforce it. Additionally, the ACA does not support undocumented immigrants, which means that health care outside of the free clinic to those who are undocumented remain relatively inaccessible.The ACA also does not reach homeless populations. Barriers include this population's low healthcare literacy, the requirements of residency verification, their difficulty accessing/applying for social services, their access to transportation, and the fact that many healthcare facilities do not accept Medicaid. It is not yet clear if and how the Trump administration will influence healthcare reform, specifically the access to healthcare for the most vulnerable. Trump often speaks out against the ACA; some scholars worry that President Trump's 2017 executive order, which eliminated cost-sharing reductions in the ACA, will result in an overall decrease in the number of people who can access affordable healthcare, thus emphasizing the need for free clinics.\n\nOf the 41 million uninsured people in the United States, the 355 officially registered free clinics in the country are only able to provide services to about 650,000 of them. On average, free clinics have annual budgets of $458,028 and have 5,989 annual patient visits. In another survey of three free clinics, 82% of patients reported that they began using a free clinics because they have are uninsured, and 59% were referred by friends/family.A similar study found that 65% were unemployed with students making up 17%. There also seems to be little correlation between education or employment status and insurance coverage in free clinic patients.\n\nFree clinic patients are mainly low-income, uninsured, female, immigrants, or minorities. About 75% of free clinic patients are between the ages of 18 and 64 years old.According to another study, 70% of all patients 20 years and older make less than US $10,000 a year.\n\nIn a 1992-1997 survey of the Charlottesville Free Clinic, the patient body consists largely of a low income working class that reflects the demographics of the Charlottesville area. Most of the patients reported that without the free clinic, they would either seek the emergency room or do nothing at all if they got sick. There has been a shift over the years from patients seeking urgent care to patients seeking treatment for chronic illnesses. Combined, these factors suggest that free clinics will require additional resources in order to meet the rising demands of their patient population.\n\nIn a study of the Miami Rescue Mission Clinic in Florida, the most common conditions were mental health, circulatory system, and musculoskeletal system disorder. The most common of the mental health disorders were depressive disorders and anxiety disorders.Throughout multiple studies about patient demographics in metropolitan settings, there was a higher than national average prevalence of mental health disorder, obesity, diabetes, and smoking in free clinic patients.\n\nSome free clinics specialize in providing primary care (acute care), while others focus on long-term chronic health issues, and many do both. Most free clinics start out seeing patients only one or two days per week, and then expand as they find additional volunteers. Because they rely on volunteers, most are only open a few hours per day; primarily in the late afternoon and early evening. Some free clinics are faith-based, meaning they are sponsored by and affiliated with a specific church or religious denomination, or they are interfaith and draw support from several different denominations or religions.\n\nFree clinics rely on donations for financial support. The amount of money they take in through donations to a large degree determines how many patients they are able to see. Because they are unlikely to have the resources to see everyone who might need their help, they usually limit who they are willing to see to just those from their own community and the surrounding areas, and especially in chronic care will only see patients from within a limited set of medical conditions.\n\nFree clinics function as health care safety nets for patients who cannot afford or access other forms of healthcare. They provide essential services regardless of the patient's ability to pay. Hospital emergency rooms are required by federal law to treat everyone regardless of their ability to pay, so people who lack the means to pay for care often seek treatment in emergency rooms for minor ailments. These hospitals function as safety net hospitals. Treating people in the ER is expensive, though, and it ties up resources designed for emergencies. When a community has a free clinic, hospitals can steer patients with simple concerns to the free clinic instead of the emergency room. Free clinics can save hospital emergency rooms thousands of dollars. A $1 investment in a free clinic can save $36 in healthcare costs at another center. For this reason, most hospitals are supportive of free clinics. Hospitals are a primary source for equipment and supplies for free clinics. When they upgrade equipment, they will often donate the older equipment to the local free clinic. In addition some hospitals supply most or all of a local clinics day-to-day medical supplies, and some do lab work free of cost as well.\n\nFree clinics can be granted medical malpractice coverage through the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). FTCA coverage includes health care professionals who are acting as volunteers. In addition it covers officers, board members, clinic employees, and individual contractors. Medical malpractice coverage does not occur automatically, each organization must be \"deemed\" eligible by the US Department of Health and Human Services. To be eligible the clinic must be an IRS recognized nonprofit, that does not accept payments from insurance companies, the government, or other organizations for the services it performs. It also must not charge patients for services. It may receive donations from anyone and any organization; the stipulation is that it may not receive financial reimbursement for service rendered, which by definition a free clinic does not.\nThe Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 provides immunity from tort claims such as negligence, bodily injury, pain and suffering that might be filed against the volunteers of nonprofit organizations. Thus, volunteers working on behalf of a nonprofit free clinic are covered under the Volunteer Protection Act from most liability claims.\n\nIndividual states may offer additional legal protections to free clinics, usually under the states Good Samaritan laws. Free clinics must still carry general liability insurance, to cover non-medical liability, such as slips and falls in the parking lot.\n\nSome pharmaceutical companies offer assistance programs for the drugs they manufacture. These programs allow those who are unable to pay for their medications to receive prescription drugs for free or at a greatly reduced cost. Many free clinics work to qualify patients on behalf of these programs. In some cases the clinic receive and then distribute the medications themselves, in others they verify that the patient is eligible for the program, and the medication is then shipped to the patient, or patient receives the medication from a local pharmacy.\nSome free clinics sole mission is to help those who do not have prescription drug coverage, and cannot afford for their medications, to enroll in prescription assistance programs. Such clinics are known as \"clinics without walls\" because they dispense with the need to have their own building, exam rooms, or clinical equipment.\n\nSome free clinics are able to assist with dental problems. This is handled either at the clinic itself, if the clinic has its own dental facilities and a dentist; or it is facilitated through a partnership with one or more local dentist who are willing to take referred patients for free. For example, a clinic might have ten local dentists who will each accept two patients per month, so this allows the clinic to treat a total of twenty dental patients each month.\nSome clinics use a referral system to handle other forms of specialized medical care.\n\nStudent-run clinics (SRC) are an increasingly prevalent part of U.S. medical school curricula, and they are designed to improve health-care delivery to underserved populations. The vast majority of these clinics are free-of-charge and they have been shown to result in high patient satisfaction The preventive medicine interventions offered at this clinics have been proved to have significantly high health and economic impacts.\n\nFree clinics allow student volunteers to become more socially aware and culturally competent in their medical experience. Medical schools sometimes do not address social determinants of health or treatment of underserved populations, and medical students can use free clinic volunteering to learn about these issues. At free clinics, medical student volunteers learn to listen to the full history of their patients and treat them as a whole rather than a list of symptoms. Medical students balance the power dynamic between the patient and provider, acting as a patient advocate. Furthermore, students who are exposed to SRCs are more likely than their peers to continue to work with underserved populations after graduation.\n\nAn example of a student-run free clinic that addresses the social determinants of health treatment is one in the University of Washington, called Students in the Community (SITC). This clinic is the only student-run clinic to be run out of a transitional housing facility for the homeless. This clinic model speaks to the embrace by student-run clinics of the increasingly prevalent holistic approach to healthcare—one that considers the social determinants of health, such as housing, as shown through its housing-first model.\n\nThe Society of Student-Run Free Clinics (SSRFC) hosts a national inter-professional platform for student-run clinics. This allows the sharing of ideas, collaborate on research, information about funding resources and encourages the expansion of existing clinics as well as the cultivate of the new ones. The SSRFC faculty network works to facilitate collaboration between student-run free clinics.\n\nThere are several proposed advantages to free clinics. They tend to be located in communities where there is a great need for health care. Free clinics are more flexible in structure than established medical institutions. They are also much less expensive - hence the title \"free clinic.\" Due to their small size, their organization tends to be more egalitarian and less hierarchical, which allows for more direct exchange of information across the clinic. Unlike regular practices, they also attempt to do more than just provide healthcare. Some were created as political acts meant to advocate for socialized medicine and society.\n\nHowever, they do come with their own set of problems. Many free clinics lack funding and do not have enough volunteers. This can contribute to a short availability of free clinics' operation hours, and can harm free clinics' ability to provide long-term, sustainable service. For instance, they are a solution aimed towards serving tens of millions of uninsured Americans, but they function solely on the spirit of altruism. Volunteers must be willing to be available during strange hours of the day and provide professional-level care all without the possibility of financial reimbursement. Additionally, the ability of free clinics to provide long term, sustainable service and maintain continuity of care for patients is questionable, considering the instability of funding and providers. One proposition towards overcoming these challenges involves the creation of a national foundation that officially assists and connects free clinics, allowing them to evolve as necessary.\n\nIn a national level survey of patients and providers at free clinics, 97% of patients were satisfied with their care, and a further 77% preferred it over their prior care. 86% of patients relied on the clinic for primary care, and 80% of patients relied on them for pharmacy services. When asked what they would do if the free clinic did not exist, 47% would look for another free clinic, 24% would not seek care, 21% would not seek care due to costs, and 23% would use the emergency room. We can analyze that the free clinic care not only satisfies the patient, but fulfilled their healthcare needs.\n\nFree clinics are usually located near the people they are trying to serve. In most cases they are located near other nonprofits that serve the same target community such as food-banks, Head Start, Goodwill Industries, the Salvation Army and public housing. Because free clinics often refer people to other medical facilities for lab work, dentistry, and other services, they may also be found in the same area of town as those medical facilities. Some clinics have working agreements with the other facilities that are willing to assist with the clinics mission. Being close to the other medical facilities makes it easier for patients to get from one to the other.\n\nContrary to a common assumption, currently existing free clinics were not necessarily established to respond to an increase in the amount of individuals who cannot afford healthcare in a given community. The prevalence of free clinics in certain areas is due to the availability of financial and human resources. For example, being close to teaching hospitals, universities, and medical facilities makes it easier to find medically trained volunteers. Furthermore, the lack of Federally Qualified Community Health Centers (FQHC) and other safety-net providers within a certain area often becomes the perceived need that motivates community leaders to establish a free clinic.\nMost free clinics start out using donated space; others start by renting or leasing space. In time and with enough community support, many go on to acquire their own buildings. Donated space may be an entire building, or it might be a couple of rooms within a church, hospital, or another business. Because the clinic will house confidential medical records, prescription medications, and must remain as clean as possible, donated space is usually set aside for the sole use of the clinic even when the clinic is closed.\n\nThe National Association of Free & Charitable Clinics maintains a database of 1,200 free and charitable clinics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1930919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930919", "title": "Abortion clinic", "text": "Abortion clinic\n\nAn abortion clinic is a medical facility that provides abortions. Such clinics may be public medical centers, private medical practices or nonprofit organizations such as Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\n\nAbortion was criminalised in the Netherlands in 1911; nonetheless, a demand for terminating pregnancies remained, and an illegal abortion market grew. In 1962, about 25,000 abortions were performed in the entire country, all of them illegal and unsafe. 70 amateur abortionists were sentenced that year. Illegal abortions were mostly performed with very risky and dangerous methods, which led to serious infections and internal bleeding. About 20 to 30 women died of complications each year, while many others were disabled for life and resigned to wheelchairs. In the late 1960s, the taboo on abortion was gradually broke in public discourse. More and more experts came to the point of view that abortions would happen anyway, whether or not the act was criminalised, and it was to conduct them safely for those women determined to end their pregnancy. In the early 1970s, the first specialised abortion clinics emerged such as in Arnhem (Mildredhuis, 1971) and Heemstede (Bloemenhove Clinic, 1973). By 1975, abortion clinic network Stimezo (an abbreviation of \"Stichting Medisch Verantwoorde Zwangerschapsonderbreking\", \"Medically Responsible Pregnancy Termination Foundation\", set up in 1969) ran 9 clinics throughout the country. The government tolerated these illegal clinics until 1976, when Minister of Justice Dries van Agt tried to close the Bloemenhove Clinic, which was promptly occupied by hundreds of pro-abortion activists from numerous women's rights organisations. After a two-week standoff, a judge ruled in favour of the clinic, and Van Agt had to back down from taking the clinic by force. It would take until 1984 when abortion was finally legalised after long-winded heated parliamentary debates, with high pressure from the pro and anti-abortion camps.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, 162 abortion clinics in the United States closed or stopped offering abortions due largely to legislative regulations enacted by Republican state lawmakers. These bills, referred to as TRAP laws (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Provider) implement medically unnecessary restrictions for clinics that will be difficult or impossible for providers to meet, therefore forcing clinics to close under the guise of increasing the safety of the procedure.\n\nAccess to abortions is extremely limited, particularly in rural and conservative areas. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 31% of women in rural areas traveled over 100 miles in order to receive an abortion while another 43% traveled between 50–100 miles. These numbers are only increasing as more clinics are forced to close. Between 2011 and 2016 the number of abortion clinics in Texas dropped from 40 to 19 as a result of the state's House Bill 2, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in June, 2016.\n\nAbortion clinics have frequently been the site of protests by anti-abortion activists. Protesters often engage in what is known as \"sidewalk counseling\", in which they warn people entering the clinic about alleged risks of abortion, attempt to offer alternatives to abortion or show pictures of fetuses. In 1985, 85% of abortion providers were experiencing either picketing, clinic blockades or invasion of the facility, with 19% of providers receiving bomb threats and 16% were picketed at their homes . In 2000 82% of facilities received protests with 61% receiving 20 or more pickets. \n\nThe 2007 film \"Juno\" contains an example of such protest. The protagonist enters a clinic with the purpose of procuring an abortion, but sees a fellow student protesting outside the clinic who tells her that the fetus \"has fingernails\". This causes Juno to change her mind about having an abortion, and she leaves the clinic, with her friend calling out to her, \"God appreciates your miracle.\"\n\nAnother tactic in which protestors film or photograph patients entering the clinic utilizes the societal stigma surrounding abortion and attempts to expose or shame women who are seeking the procedure. Anti-abortion activists have also attempted to access abortion clinic medical records by breaking into dumpsters, proposing state legislation that would require clinics to provide information regarding their patients to the government and hacking online databases containing confidential patient information.\n\nIn some countries, a buffer zone is enforced to prevent protesters from standing within a certain distance of the clinic entrance. In the United States these buffer zones have been the subject of many lawsuits and legislative actions on both statewide and national levels. In 2014 the Supreme Court struck down a Massachusetts bill that had legalized a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics in the state in 2007.\n\nAbortion clinics have frequently been subject to anti-abortion violence. \"The New York Times\" cites over one hundred clinic bombings and incidents of arson, over three hundred invasions, and over four hundred incidents of vandalism between 1978 and 1993, and the National Abortion Federation, an organization of abortion providers, cites over 300 attempted or completed instances of bombing or arson, thousands of invasions and vandalism incidents, as well as other attacks, between 1977 and 2009. According to the NAF, the first instance of arson at an abortion clinic took place in March 1976 in Oregon, and the first bombing was in Ohio in February 1978. Some notable incidents are:\n\nIn the United States, the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act was passed in 1994 in response to acts of violence at clinics, which prohibits the use of force or obstruction to interfere with a person's attempt to obtain or provide reproductive health services, and the intentional damage of a reproductive health care facility such as an abortion clinic.\n\n\n"}

It was developed by Team17. The game was the first in the series to be in 3D and also featured several new weapons. Additionally, some of the weapons operations are substantially different from previous Worms titles. And while it is rated T by the ESRB, which is a first for the series, it is rated 3+ by PEGI, which is also a first for the series. (Before, the games were rated 7+ or 12+) It is unknown why the ESRB chose the higher rating while PEGI chose the 3+ rating. The OS X version of the game was released in April 2004 by Feral Interactive.\n\nThe game was announced by Team17 in 2002 as \"Worms 3\", featuring a different logo and initially announced to be published by Activision. In 2003 the name changed to \"Worms 3D\" and Activision were dropped as the publisher. It was later announced that Sega would be publishing the game in European territories.\n\nThe music was composed by Bjorn Lynne.\n\nThe European release makes use of Junior Senior's \"Shake Your Coconuts\", by default, the game's title screen plays the song with the lyrics included, while the Main Menu plays the instrumental version.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mostly unchanged from its predecessors, with the exception of the three-dimensional view, which allows the player more freedom, and more possibilities, to complete the task at hand. Modes such as Campaign and Quick Match return from previous versions. The game also features a multiplayer feature, as well as the ability to edit and create teams. The objective of most of the matches is to eliminate the opposing forces' worms, whereas the Campaign mode gives the player sets of specific goals which he needs to complete.\n\nThe Campaign consists of 35 small missions in which the player has to utilise their worms to complete a certain task, like destroy enemy worms, collect a certain crate, or even unique missions, such as having to detonate 16 hidden landmines in a certain time.\n\nAll of the missions give awards depending on how well the player does. Gold medals usually unlock bonuses as for example maps, challenge missions, information about weapons, or voice banks.\n\nIn the Challenge missions, the player has to use a weapon/utility to collect targets that add to their timebank, which increases steadily. Getting a gold medal here unlocks maps or locked weapons.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews, mostly of its graphics and sounds. Despite this, most reviewers criticized the 3D camera system, that often places behind the objects in landscape with the worm being hidden in front of those and stiff controlling of the worm.\n\n"}

Many metals form binary compounds containing arsenic, and these are called arsenides. They exist with many stoichiometries, and in this respect arsenides are similar to phosphides.\n\nThe group 1 alkali metals and the group 2, alkaline earth metals, form arsenides with isolated arsenic atoms. They form upon heating arsenic powder with excess sodium gives sodium arsenide (NaAs). The structure of NaAs is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal. This short distance indicates the complex bonding in these simple phases, i.e. they are not simply salts of As anion, for example. The compound LiAs, has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating some metallic bonding. These compounds are mainly of academic interest. For example, \"sodium arsenide\" is a structural motif adopted by many compounds with the AB stoichiometry.\n\nIndicative of their salt-like properties, hydrolysis of alkali metal arsenides gives arsine:\n\nMany arsenides of the group 13 elements (group III) are valuable semiconductors. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) features isolated arsenic centers with a zincblende structure (wurtzite structure can eventually also form in nanostructures), and with predominantly covalent bonding – it is a III–V semiconductor.\n\nArsenic anionics are known to catenate, that is, form chains, rings, and cages. The mineral skutterudite (CoAs) features rings that are usually described as . Assigning formal oxidation numbers is difficult because these materials are highly covalent and often are best described with band theory. Sperrylite (PtAs) is usually described as . The arsenides of the transition metals are mainly of interest because they contaminate sulfidic ores of commercial interest. The extraction of the metals – nickel, iron, cobalt, copper – entails chemical processes such as smelting that poses environmental risks. In the mineral, arsenic is immobile and poses no environmental risk. Released from the mineral, arsenic is poisonous and mobile.\n\nPartial reduction of arsenic with alkali metals (and related electropositive elements) affords polyarsenic compounds, which are members of the Zintl phases.\n\n"}

{"id": "1930927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930927", "title": "John Christie (murderer)", "text": "John Christie (murderer)\n\nJohn Reginald Halliday Christie (8 April 1899 – 15 July 1953), known to his family and friends as Reg Christie, was an English serial killer and necrophile from Halifax, who was active during the 1940s and early 1950s. He murdered at least eight people – including his wife, Ethel – by strangling them in his flat at 10 Rillington Place, Notting Hill, London. Christie moved out of Rillington Place during March 1953; soon afterward the bodies of three of his victims were discovered hidden in a wallpaper-covered alcove in the kitchen. Two further bodies were discovered in the garden, and his wife's body was found beneath the floorboards of the front room. Christie was arrested and convicted of his wife's murder, for which he was hanged.\n\nTwo of Christie's victims were Beryl Evans and her baby daughter Geraldine, who, along with Beryl's husband, Timothy Evans, were tenants at 10 Rillington Place during 1948–49. This case sparked huge controversy after Evans was charged with both murders, found guilty of the murder of his daughter and hanged in 1950. Christie was a major prosecution witness; when his own crimes were discovered three years later, serious doubts were raised about the integrity of Evans' conviction. Christie himself subsequently admitted killing Beryl, but not Geraldine; it is now generally accepted that Christie murdered both Beryl and Geraldine and that police mishandling of the original inquiry allowed Christie to escape detection and enabled him to murder four more women. The High Court overturned Evans's case during the 2000s, accepting that Evans did not murder either his wife or his child.\n\nJohn Christie was born in Northowram near Halifax in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the sixth in a family of seven children. Christie had a troubled relationship with his father, carpet designer Ernest John Christie, an austere and uncommunicative man who displayed little emotion towards his children and would punish them for trivial offences. He was also alternately coddled and bullied by his mother and older sisters.\n\nDuring his later life, Christie's childhood peers described him as \"a queer lad\" who \"kept himself to himself\" and \"was not very popular\". On 24 March 1911, his grandfather David Halliday died aged 75 in Christie's house after a long illness. Christie later said that seeing his grandfather's body laid out on a trestle table gave him a feeling of power and well-being; a man he had once feared was now only a corpse.\n\nAt the age of 11, Christie won a scholarship to Halifax Secondary School, where his favourite subject was mathematics, particularly algebra. He was also good at History and Woodwork. It was later found he had an IQ of 128. He sang in the church choir and was a Boy Scout. He also attended \"Boothtown Council School\" (also known as Boothtown Board School\") in Northowram. After leaving school on 22 April 1913, he began a job as an assistant cinema projectionist.\n\nChristie had a lifelong problem with impotence; his first attempts at sex were failures, and he was branded \"Reggie-No-Dick\" and \"Can't-Do-It-Christie\" throughout adolescence. (Nevertheless, a post-mortem report confirmed Christie's genitals were physically normal.) His difficulties with sex remained throughout his life, and most of the time he could only perform with prostitutes.\n\nIn September 1916, Christie enlisted in the army; he was called up on 12 April 1917 to join the 52nd Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment, to serve as an infantryman. In April 1918, the regiment was despatched to France, where Christie was seconded to the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment as a signalman. That June, he was injured in a mustard gas attack and spent a month in a military hospital in Calais. Christie claimed this attack left him permanently unable to speak loudly. Later in life, he also claimed the attack had rendered him blind and mute for three and a half years. His period of muteness was, he claimed, the reason for his inability to talk much louder than a whisper for the rest of his life. Ludovic Kennedy points out that no record of his blindness has been traced and that, while Christie may have lost his voice when he was admitted to hospital, he would not have been discharged as fit for duty had he remained a mute. His inability to talk loudly, Kennedy argues, was a psychological reaction to the gassing rather than a lasting toxic effect of the gas. That reaction, and Christie's exaggeration of the effects of the attack, stemmed from an underlying personality disorder that caused him to exaggerate or feign illness as a ploy to get attention and sympathy.\n\nChristie was demobilised from the army on 22 October 1919. He joined the Royal Air Force on 13 December 1923, but was discharged on 15 August 1924.\n\nChristie married Ethel Simpson, who was also from Halifax, at Halifax Register Office on 10 May 1920. His problems with impotence remained, and he continued to visit prostitutes. Early in the marriage Ethel suffered a miscarriage. They separated after four years of marriage. Ethel worked at the \"Garside Engineering Co\" on Ironbridge Road in Bradford, and later worked at the \"English Electrical Co\" on Thornton Road in Bradford until 1928. In 1928, Ethel and her siblings, moved from Halifax and Bradford, to Sheffield. In 1923, Christie moved to London; he spent the next decade in and out of prison, while Ethel remained in Halifax, Bradford and Sheffield with her relatives. He was released from prison in January 1934, when the couple reunited and moved to Rillington Place.\n\nDuring the first decade of his marriage to Ethel, Christie was convicted of several criminal offences. He started work as a postman on 10 January 1921 in Halifax, and his first conviction was for stealing postal orders on 20 February and 26 March, for which he received three months' imprisonment on 12 April 1921. He served his sentence in HM Prison Manchester and was released on 27 June. He was then convicted on 15 January 1923 of obtaining money on false pretences and of violent conduct, for which, respectively, he was bound over and put on 12 months' probation. He committed two further crimes of larceny during 1924, and received consecutive sentences of three and six months' imprisonment on 22 September 1924 in HM Prison Wandsworth. On 13 May 1929, after working for over two years as a lorry driver Christie was convicted of assaulting Maud Cole, with whom he was living in Battersea, and was sentenced to six months' hard labour; Christie had hit Cole over the head with a cricket bat, which the magistrate described as a \"murderous attack\" for which he was again sent to HM Prison Wandsworth. Finally, he was convicted of stealing a car and was re-imprisoned in HM Prison Wandsworth for three months on 1 November 1933.\n\nChristie and Ethel were reconciled in 1934 after this release from prison. He ended his recourse to petty crime but continued to seek out prostitutes. In 1937, Christie and his wife moved into the top-floor flat of 10 Rillington Place in Notting Hill, then a rather run-down area of London. They moved into the ground-floor flat in December 1938. The house was a three-storey brick end-terrace, built in the 1870s during a period of intensive speculative building in the area that resulted in much jerry-built property, and which had declined into poorly-maintained and unimproved multi-occupancy rentals. Number 10 was of a common design: the ground and first floors each contained a bedroom and living room, with a kitchen/scullery in the adjacent extension but the second-floor flat had two rooms only: a kitchen/living room and a bedroom. Living conditions were \"squalid\" – the building's occupants shared one outside lavatory, and none of the flats had a bathroom. The street was close to an above-ground section of the Metropolitan line (now the Hammersmith & City and Circle lines), and the train noise would have been \"deafening\" for the occupants of 10 Rillington Place.\n\nAfter three years of working as a foreman at the Commodore Cinema in King Street, Hammersmith, at the beginning of the Second World War Christie applied to join the War Reserve Police and was accepted, despite his criminal record, as the authorities failed to check his records. He was assigned to the Harrow Road Police Station, where he met a woman called Gladys Jones with whom he began an affair. Their relationship lasted until mid-1943, when the woman's husband, a serving soldier, returned from the war. After learning of the affair, he went to the house where his wife was living, discovered Christie there, and assaulted him.\n\nChristie committed his murders over a ten-year period between 1943 and 1953, usually by strangling his victims after he had rendered them unconscious with domestic gas; some he raped as they lay unconscious.\n\nThe first person Christie admitted to killing was Ruth Fuerst, a 21-year-old Austrian munitions worker who supplemented her income by occasionally engaging in prostitution. Christie claimed to have met Fuerst while she was soliciting clients in a snack bar in Ladbroke Grove. According to his own statements, on 24 August 1943, he invited Fuerst to his home to engage in sex (his wife was visiting relatives at the time). Afterwards, Christie impulsively strangled her on his bed with a length of rope. He initially stowed Fuerst's body beneath the floorboards of his living room, then buried it in the back garden the following evening.\n\nSoon after the murder, at the end of 1943, Christie resigned as a Special Constable. The following year he found new employment as a clerk at an Acton radio factory. There he met his second victim, colleague Muriel Amelia Eady. On 7 October 1944, he invited Eady back to his flat with the promise that he had concocted a \"special mixture\" that could cure her bronchitis. Eady was to inhale the mixture from a jar with a tube inserted in the top. The mixture in fact was Friar's Balsam, which Christie used to disguise the smell of domestic gas. Once Eady was seated breathing the mixture from the tube with her back turned, Christie inserted a second tube into the jar connected to a gas tap. As Eady continued breathing she inhaled the domestic gas, which soon rendered her unconscious – domestic gas during the 1940s was coal gas, which had a carbon monoxide content of 15 %. Christie raped and strangled her before burying her alongside Fuerst.\n\nDuring Easter of 1948, Timothy Evans and his wife Beryl moved into the top-floor flat at Rillington Place, where Beryl gave birth that October to their daughter, Geraldine. In late 1949, Evans informed police that his wife was dead. A police search of 10 Rillington Place failed to find her body, but a later search revealed the bodies of Beryl, Geraldine, and a 16-week male foetus in an outdoor wash-house. Beryl's body had been wrapped twice, in a blanket and then a table cloth. The post-mortem revealed that both mother and daughter had been strangled and that Beryl had been physically assaulted before her death, shown by facial bruising. Evans at first claimed that Christie had killed his wife in a botched abortion operation, but police questioning eventually produced a confession. The alleged confession may have been fabricated by the police, as the statement appears contrived and artificial. After being charged Evans withdrew his confession and once again accused Christie, this time of both murders.\n\nOn 11 January 1950, Evans was put on trial for the murder of his daughter, the prosecution having decided not to pursue a second charge of murdering his wife. Christie was a principal witness for the Crown: he denied Evans's accusations and gave detailed evidence about the quarrels between him and his wife. The jury found Evans guilty despite the revelation of Christie's criminal record of theft and violence. Evans was originally due to be hanged on 31 January, but appealed. After his appeal on 20 February had failed, Evans was hanged at Pentonville Prison on 9 March 1950. Christie lost the job he had held for four years at the Post Office Savings Bank due to the disclosure of his criminal convictions at the trial.\n\nThe police made several mistakes in the handling of the case, especially in overlooking the remains of Christie's previous murder victims in the garden at Rillington Place; one femur was later found propping up a fence. The garden of the property was very small, about , and the fence was parallel to the wash-house where the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine were later found. Several searches were made at the house after Evans confessed to placing his wife's remains in the drains, but the three policemen conducting the search did not go into the wash-house. The garden was apparently examined but was not excavated at this point. Christie later admitted that his dog had unearthed Eady's skull in the garden shortly after these police searches; he threw the skull into an abandoned bombed-out house in nearby St. Marks Road. There was clearly no systematic search made of the crime scene, in which this or other human remains would have been found and pointed to Christie as the perpetrator. Several police searches of the property showed a complete lack of expertise in handling forensic evidence and were quite superficial, at best. Had the searches been conducted effectively, the investigation would have exposed Christie as a murderer, and the lives of Evans and four women would have been saved.\n\nThe evidence of builders working at the house was ignored, and their various interviews with Evans suggest that the police concocted a false confession. It should have been clear, for example, from the very first statement made by Evans in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, on 30 November 1949, that he was totally unaware of the resting place of the body of his wife, or how she had been killed. He claimed that his wife's body was in either a manhole or a drain at the front of the house, but a police search failed to find any remains there. That should have prompted a thorough search of the house, wash-house and garden, but no further action was taken until later, when the two bodies were found in the wash-house. Evans was also totally unaware at his first interview that his daughter had been killed. The police interrogation in London was mishandled from the start, when they showed him the clothes of his wife and baby and revealed that they had been found in the wash-house. Such information should have been kept from him so as to force him to tell police where the bodies had been concealed. The several apparent \"confessions\" contain questionable words and phrases in high-register language such as \"terrific argument\" which seem out of place for a distressed, uneducated, working-class young man such as Evans and bear no relation to what he probably said. These were almost certainly inventions made much later by the police, Ludovic Kennedy commented, much after the truth about Christie had emerged.\n\nThe police accepted all of Christie's statements as factual without major scrutiny, and he was the crucial witness at the trial of Evans. As Kennedy wrote, the police accepted the former war reserve policeman Christie as one of their own, and largely took what he said on face value without any further investigation. Bearing in mind Christie had criminal convictions for theft and malicious wounding (while Evans did not have any previous convictions for violence), the reliance on his testimony was questionable. It is significant that Christie had claimed to be an abortionist prior to his meeting the Evanses, having said so to a colleague in 1947. He also repeated this claim after the Evans trial to women he spoke to in cafes, whom he possibly regarded as future potential victims. Such an approach aligns with Christie's \"modus operandi\" of offering help to women so as to gain their confidence and lure them back to his flat, as demonstrated in Eady's case.\n\nNearly three years passed without major incident for Christie after Evans's trial. Christie found alternative employment as a clerk with the British Road Services at their Shepherd's Bush depot. At the same time, new tenants arrived to fill the vacant first- and second-floor rooms at 10 Rillington Place. The tenants were predominantly black immigrants from the West Indies; this horrified the Christies, who held racist attitudes towards their neighbours and disliked living with them. Tensions between the new tenants and the Christies came to a head when Ethel Christie prosecuted one of her neighbours for assault. Christie successfully negotiated with the Poor Man's Lawyer Centre to continue to have exclusive use of the back garden, ostensibly to have space between him and his neighbours, but quite possibly to prevent anyone from uncovering the human remains buried there.\n\nOn the morning of 14 December 1952, Christie strangled Ethel in bed. She had last been seen in public two days earlier. Christie invented several stories to explain his wife's disappearance and to help mitigate the possibility of further inquiries being made. In reply to a letter from relatives in Sheffield, he wrote that Ethel had rheumatism and could not write herself; to one neighbour, he explained that she was visiting her relatives in Sheffield; to another, he said that she had gone to Birmingham. Christie had resigned from his job on 6 December and had been unemployed since then. To support himself, he sold Ethel's wedding ring, watch, and furniture. Every week Christie went to the Labour Exchange to collect his unemployment benefit. On 26 January 1953 he forged his wife's signature and emptied her bank account.\n\nBetween 19 January and 6 March 1953, Christie murdered three more women he invited back to 10 Rillington Place: Kathleen Maloney, Rita Nelson and Hectorina MacLennan. Maloney was a prostitute from the Ladbroke Grove area. Nelson was from Belfast and was visiting her sister in Ladbroke Grove when she met Christie. She was six months pregnant at the time of her murder. Christie first met MacLennan, who was living in London with her boyfriend, Alex Baker, in a café. All three met on several occasions after this, and Christie let MacLennan and Baker stay at Rillington Place while they were looking for accommodation. On another occasion, Christie met MacLennan on her own and persuaded her to come back to his flat, where he murdered her. Later, he convinced Baker, who came to Rillington Place looking for MacLennan, that he had not seen her. Christie kept up the pretence for several days, meeting Baker regularly to see if he had news of her whereabouts and to help him search for her.\n\nFor the murders of his final three victims, Christie modified the gassing technique he had first used on Eady; he used a rubber tube connected to the gas pipe in the kitchen which he kept closed off with a bulldog clip. He seated his victims in the kitchen, released the clip on the tube, and let gas leak into the room. The Brabin Report pointed out that Christie's explanation of his gassing technique was not satisfactory because he would have been overpowered by the gas as well. Nevertheless, it was established that all three victims had been exposed to carbon monoxide. The gas made his victims drowsy, after which Christie strangled them with a length of rope.\n\nAs with Eady, Christie repeatedly raped his last three victims while they were unconscious and continued to do so as they died. When this aspect of his crimes was publicly revealed, Christie quickly gained a reputation for being a necrophiliac. One commentator has cautioned against categorising Christie as such; according to the accounts Christie gave to the police, he did not engage sexually with any of his victims exclusively after death. After Christie had murdered each of his final victims by ligature strangulation, he placed a vest or other cloth-like material between their legs before wrapping their semi-naked bodies in blankets (in a similar manner to the way in which Beryl's body had been wrapped), before stowing their bodies in a small alcove behind the back kitchen wall. He later covered the entrance to this alcove with wallpaper.\n\nChristie moved out of 10 Rillington Place on 20 March 1953, after fraudulently sub-letting his flat to a couple from whom he took £7 13s 0d (£7.65 or about £ as of ). The landlord visited that same evening and, finding the couple there instead of Christie, demanded that they leave first thing the next morning. The landlord then allowed the tenant of the top-floor flat, Beresford Brown, to use Christie's kitchen. On 24 March, Brown discovered the kitchen alcove when he attempted to insert brackets into the wall to hold a wireless set. Peeling back the wallpaper, Brown saw the bodies of Maloney, Nelson and MacLennan. After getting confirmation from another tenant in 10 Rillington Place that they were dead bodies, Brown informed the police and a citywide search for Christie began.\n\nAfter he left Rillington Place, Christie went to a Rowton House in King's Cross, where he booked a room for seven nights under his real name and address. He stayed for only four nights, leaving on 24 March when news of the discovery at his flat broke, after which he wandered around London, spending much of his time in cafés. On the morning of 31 March, Christie was arrested on the embankment near Putney Bridge after being challenged about his identity by a police officer; all he had in his possession were some coins and an old newspaper clipping about the remand of Timothy Evans.\n\nChristie was placed under arrest and at first only admitted to the murders of the women in the alcove and his wife during police questioning. When informed about the skeletons buried in the back garden, Christie admitted responsibility for their deaths as well. He later confessed to the murder of Beryl Evans, which Timothy Evans had originally been charged with during the police investigation in 1949, although for the most part he denied killing Geraldine. On one occasion following his trial, Christie indicated that he may have been responsible for her death as well, having said so to a hospital orderly. It is speculated that Christie would not have wanted to readily admit his guilt in Geraldine's death in order not to lose respect from the jury, and for his own safety from his fellow inmates.\n\nChristie was tried only for the murder of his wife Ethel. His trial began on 22 June 1953, in the same court in which Evans had been tried three years earlier. Christie pleaded insanity and claimed to have a poor memory of the events. Dr. Matheson, a doctor at Brixton Prison who evaluated Christie, was called as a witness by the prosecution. He testified that Christie had a hysterical personality but was not insane. The jury rejected Christie's plea, and after deliberating for 85 minutes found him guilty. Christie did not appeal against his conviction.\n\nChristie was hanged on 15 July 1953 at Pentonville Prison. His executioner was Albert Pierrepoint, who had previously hanged Evans. After being pinioned for execution, Christie complained that his nose itched. Pierrepoint assured him that, \"It won't bother you for long\".\n\n\nBased on the pubic hair that Christie collected, it has been speculated that he was responsible for more murders than those carried out at 10 Rillington Place. Christie claimed that the four different clumps of hair in his collection came from his wife and the three bodies discovered in the kitchen alcove, but only one matched the hair type on those bodies, Ethel Christie's. Even if two of the others had come from the bodies of Fuerst and Eady, which had by then decomposed into skeletons, there was still one remaining clump of hair unaccounted for—it could not have come from Beryl Evans, as no pubic hair had been removed from her body.\n\nWriting in 1978, Professor Keith Simpson, one of the pathologists involved in the forensic examination of Christie's victims, had this to say about the pubic hair collection:\nNo attempts were or have been made to trace any further victims of Christie, such as examining records of missing women in London during his period of activity. Michael Eddowes suggested that Christie had been in a perfect position, as a special police constable during the war, to have committed many more murders than have been discovered. On the other hand, historian Jonathan Oates considers it unlikely Christie had any further victims, arguing he would not have deviated from his standard method of killing in his place of residence.\n\nFollowing Christie's conviction there was substantial controversy concerning the earlier trial of Timothy Evans, who had been convicted mainly on the evidence of Christie, who lived in the same property in which Evans had allegedly carried out his crimes. Christie confessed to Beryl's murder and although he neither confessed to, nor was charged with, Geraldine's murder, he was widely considered guilty of both murders at the time. This, in turn, cast doubt on the fairness of Evans' trial and raised the possibility that an innocent person had been hanged.\n\nThe controversy prompted the then Home Secretary, David Maxwell-Fyfe, to commission an inquiry led by John Scott Henderson, QC, the Recorder of Portsmouth, to determine whether Evans had been innocent and a miscarriage of justice had occurred. Henderson interviewed Christie before his execution, as well as another twenty witnesses who had been involved in either of the police investigations. He concluded that Evans was in fact guilty of both murders and that Christie's confessions to the murder of Beryl were unreliable and made in the context of furthering his own defence that he was insane.\n\nFar from ending the matter, questions continued to be raised in Parliament concerning Evans's innocence, along with newspaper campaigns and books being published making similar claims. The Henderson Inquiry was criticised for being held over too short a time period (one week) and for being prejudiced against the possibility that Evans was innocent. This controversy, along with the coincidence that two stranglers would have been living in the same property at the same time if Evans and Christie had both been guilty, kept alive the issue that a miscarriage of justice had taken place in Evans's trial.\n\nThis uncertainty led to a second inquiry, chaired by High Court judge, Sir Daniel Brabin, which was conducted over the winter of 1965–66. Brabin re-examined much of the evidence from both cases and evaluated some of the arguments for Evans's innocence. His conclusions were that it was \"more probable than not\" that Evans had killed his wife but not his daughter Geraldine, for whose death Christie was responsible. Christie's likely motive was that her continued presence would have drawn attention to Beryl's disappearance, which Christie would have been averse to as it increased the risk that his own murders would be discovered. Brabin also noted that the uncertainty involved in the case would have prevented a jury from being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Evans's guilt had he been re-tried. These conclusions were used by the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, to recommend a posthumous pardon for Evans, which was granted, as he had been tried and executed for the murder of his daughter. Jenkins announced the granting of Evans's pardon to the House of Commons on 18 October 1966. It allowed authorities to return Evans's remains to his family, who had him reburied in a private grave.\n\nThere was already debate in the United Kingdom over the continued use of the death penalty. The controversy in Evans's case and other controversial cases contributed to the 1965 suspension, and subsequent abolition, of capital punishment in the United Kingdom for murder.\n\nIn January 2003, the Home Office awarded Evans's half-sister, Mary Westlake, and his sister, Eileen Ashby, \"ex-gratia\" payments as compensation for the miscarriage of justice in his trial. The independent assessor for the Home Office, Lord Brennan QC, accepted that \"the conviction and execution of Timothy Evans for the murder of his child was wrongful and a miscarriage of justice\" and that \"there is no evidence to implicate Timothy Evans in the murder of his wife. She was most probably murdered by Christie.\" Lord Brennan believed that the Brabin Report's conclusion that Evans probably murdered his wife should be rejected given Christie's confessions and conviction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is much like its 3D predecessor \"Worms 3D\", except that players can customize their worm's appearance (hats/helmets, glasses, facial hair, gloves/hands) as well as create their own unique weapons in a new feature called \"The Weapon Factory\". The game also contains a shop where players can buy various items, using points won by completing story missions, challenges, or unlocking trophies. Shop items include new maps, new accessories and attire, personality banks (voices) and game styles. There are several new weapons and utilities included in the new game such as Bubble Trouble, Icarus Potion, Poison Arrow, Sniper Rifle, Inflatable Scouser, Tail Nail and Starburst. Unlike previous \"Worms\" games, \"Worms 4: Mayhem\" provides cutscenes before each story mission to reveal background information.\n\nThe player's team of worms arrives at Worminkle University, where they meet Professor Worminkle, who trains the team to use various weapons. Worminkle then sets the team assignments to sneak into enemy buildings and destroy their construction sites. To flee government agents, Worminkle and the team travel back in time to the Middle Ages using Worminkle's time machine, but the machine gets damaged and they get attacked by wizards and knights. After fighting through them, the team proceed to the Wild West to find gold to keep the machine powered, fighting Boggy the Kid in the process, and to Ancient Arabia to recover jewels stolen by Ali Baboon and his pesky thieves and keep the machine's navigation controls balanced.\n\nAfter recovering the jewels, Worminkle fixes the machine, but accidentally drops a letter. The team reads the letter, which reveals that the government was planning to build a new research laboratory to replace Worminkle University. Worminkle quickly takes the letter back and continues the journey with the team, but after they stop in prehistoric times, Worminkle betrays the team, telling them he actually used them as part of his plan to escape from the Government. Planning to abandon the team in the Stone Age, he flees, but crashes into a mountain. Determined to catch him, the team battle through caveworms and dinoworms. After reaching Worminkle, the team, knowing of his betrayal, steals the time machine from him and travels back to the present day, leaving Worminkle trapped in the Stone Age forever and panicking.\n\nGameplay follows on the traditional gameplay of the series, in which teams of worms take turns to use a variety of weapons and items in order to eliminate the opposing team(s). The game is presented in a 3D perspective.\n\nThe game also has additional game modes, such as Challenge mode, which presents the player with various challenges (e.g. infecting enemy worms with a poison arrow) which the player must attempt to complete.\n\nMultiplayer mode is available via Hotseat. Online mode is also available on the PC version.\n\nWorms 4: Mayhem received mixed to positive reviews. Critics generally criticized Worms 4: Mayhem for its lack of difference from previous 3D Worms games, difficult controls and illogical AI. However, the range of weapons were praised for including new and existing weapons, along with the level design.\n"}

{"id": "1930965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930965", "title": "Wind on Fire", "text": "Wind on Fire\n\nWind on Fire is a fantasy trilogy written by William Nicholson.\n\nThe books are set in a realm similar to ours, but separate. They tell the story of the Hath family and the Manth people, who go on a long, harsh journey from their city-prison to their homeland. The main characters, Kestrel and Bowman Hath, are twins who have certain powers that allow them to save their people, and friends, from an evil power called the Morah. The first book tells of the events unfolding near and inside Aramanth, the second one talks about the lives of the Manth people as slaves in The Mastery, and the third book concludes with their voyage to the homeland.\n\nThe trilogy begins with \"The Wind Singer\", which introduces the protagonists Kestrel and her beloved empath brother, Bowman. They live in a city called Aramanth, where personal freedoms don't exist and success depends solely on performance in universal compulsory examinations. Kestrel is a strong-willed individual who fiercely loves her family and despises the Exams. So great is her hatred of them that she denounces all the values and principles of Aramanth, as well as denying the existence of the Emperor, the unseen ruler of Aramanth. This sets in motion a chain of events that eventually results in Kestrel, Bowman and a neglected boy called Mumpo escaping from the city and going on a quest to save their people from an evil entity known as the Morah, which controls a numberless army of malevolent and deadly beings called the Zars. The children are successful, and a new era dawns for Aramanth.\n\nIn \"Slaves of the Mastery\" the people of Aramanth have become pleasant and passive, no longer in the grip of the Morah. This new meekness attracts the attention of the powerful Mastery, a realm built entirely by slave labour and ruled by the merciless Master. Aramanth is destroyed and survivors of the slaughter - including the Haths- are taken into slavery. Kestrel evades capture and sets off after her family, intent on revenge and the liberation of her people. In the course of the book Bowman finds his psychic powers growing, and discovers that he has a greater part to play in the destiny of his people than he originally knew. Ira Hath also begins to prophesy about the destiny of the Manth people and a return to their homeland. Bowman eventually defeats the Master, destroying the Mastery and leaving his people free to seek out the homeland.\n\nThe trilogy concludes with \"Firesong\", which sees the remaining Manth people follow prophetess Ira Hath to the Manth homeland. Contending with harsh weather, starvation and various other dangers of the wilderness, the band struggle to survive, whilst Ira grows weaker the closer they get. Bowman and Kestrel leave their family in order to train as Singer people and they finally understand their part to play in what is to come. Kestrel sacrifices herself, along with the Singer people, in a final battle against the Morah, causing the “wind on fire” to sweep the world and purge it of the evil entity. This allows the Manth people to finally reach the homeland, where they begin their lives again.\n\n\nKestrel Hath: The main character in the trilogy. Kestrel, known as Kess to those close to her, has an extremely strong personality that does not submit to repression of any kind. This often leads her to rash, instinctive action rather than first thinking things through. At the age of 10, Kestrel, along with her brother Bowman and her friend Mumpo, return the voice of the wind singer to their hometown of Aramanth in order to release the evil Morah's hold on the city. Five years later, when Aramanth is burned by the Mastery, Kestrel is separated from her people, but is reunited with them through the marriage of the Johdila Sirharasi of Gang to Marius Semeon Ortiz, adoptive son of the Master. After the fall of the Mastery, Kestrel accompanies the Manth people part of their way to the \"homeland\", but is taken by the Singer people as the child of the prophet Ira Manth to help them destroy the Morah. Kestrel \"dies\" in the process of this, but her spirit remains a part of Bowman's mind. Kestrel shares a deep emotional bond with her twin brother Bowman which allows them to communicate telepathically.\n\nBowman Hath: Kestrel's twin brother. He is somewhat empathetic, and can 'read' hearts and minds. As a person, Bowman is much quieter, less outspoken and less rash than his sister. A phrase often used to describe the two is \"He is the one who feels, and she is the one who does\". Bowman assists Kestrel and Mumpo in the retrieval of the wind singer's voice, is taken as a slave to the Mastery and later helps the Manth people to find their homeland. He also falls in love with the Johdila Sirharasi (\"Sisi\"), a princess of the land of Gang. Although he at first does not pursue their relationship, believing he had to die in order to defeat the Morah, it turns out that Kestrel must die instead of him. Bowman marries Sisi, becomes the ruler of Gang and has three children: Sirharani, Falcon and Ira.\n\nMaslo Inch: The power-hungry High Examiner of Aramanth in Book 1. He punishes the Hath family for rebelling against his system of examinations and ratings, but is stripped of power when Aramanth is freed from the Morah. He also reveals that he is the father of Mumpo. After the loss of his title, Maslo becomes a humble person, seemingly having lost some of his mental faculties, and hardly an adequate father for Mumpo. He is the first of the Manth people to be burned to death in the monkey cages of the Mastery, a deed ordered by Marius Semeon Ortiz to deter any further dissent amongst the new slaves.\n\nPinto (Pinpin) Hath: Kestrel and Bowman's younger sister. She takes her first test at the age of two at the beginning of the story. As she grows older she becomes infatuated with Mumpo, to the point of hating her sister, through jealousy of Mumpo's adoration of her. She shares Kestrel's fiery determination, and it is later discovered that she shares at least some of her family's psychic powers as well. The epilogue of the final book tells of her eventual betrothal to Mumpo.\n\nHanno Hath: Kestrel, Bowman and Pinto's father. He works as a librarian, and although intelligent, performs poorly in Aramanth's High Examinations due to his quiet rebellion against the system. When he is taken away to a Residential Study Course, which is described as \"more like prison\", he stirs himself and the other members up in rebellion. Members of this group, including Miko Mimilith and especially Scooch, become more trusting of Hanno through this. Hanno becomes the leader of the Manth people after they escape from the Mastery and successfully leads them to the Manth homeland.\n\nIra Hath: Hanno's wife. Descended from the great prophet Ira Manth, Ira often enjoys using her 'prophetess voice'. She decides, after Kestrel and Bowman begin their quest and her husband is imprisoned, to actually act as a prophetess, wearing forbidden many-coloured clothing and standing at the foot of the wind singer to preach to the people. Throughout the second and third books, her powers of prophecy grow as her strength wanes. She eventually leads the Manth people to their promised land, but dies just before she herself reaches it.\n\nMumpo Inch: A dribbling and foul-smelling boy who is at the bottom of Kestrel's class. It is implied that he suffers from some form of learning disability. As the books progress, however, he matures and becomes surprisingly endearing. At the end of The Wind Singer Mumpo finds out that his father is Maslo Inch, the high examiner. Kestrel hates him in the first book and is angered that he joins her quest, but learns to like him. In the second book he trains to be a gladiator for the Mastery. This training makes him the Manth people's best warrior. In love with Kestrel from the first time she spoke to him, he is eventually betrothed to her sister, Pinto.\n\nSirharasi (Sisi): Featuring only in books 2 and 3, she is a beautiful but spoiled and childish princess, who has an arranged marriage to Ortiz, heir of the Master. After falling in love with Bowman, she rebels and refuses to marry, which throws the whole country of the Mastery into chaos. After being disfigured by Zohan for refusing to marry him she changes and matures greatly, shedding her royal status and joining the Manth people on their voyage. She marries Bowman and has several children by him.\n\nMarius Semeon Ortiz: A young, handsome and prominent general. He leads the army that destroys Aramanth, hoping to gain favour with the Master by bringing back a record number of slaves. Successful in this endeavour, he is made the Master's heir and thus groom to Sisi's bride. Though in love with Kestrel, he submits to the Master's will to marry Sisi, however when order to kill her by the master he attempts to but finds he cannot at the last moment but Mumpo sees him with his sword raised and kills him unknowingly.\n\nAlbard: A.K.A. the Master, a rebellious Singer. In \"Firesong\" he teaches Bowman how to use his powers.\n\nThe Morah: A satanic character, the Morah is mentioned in the first book as being a \"Spirit lord\" who grew envious of the Wind-Singer and stole its power. The Manth people greatly fear the Morah and deny its existence, dismissing it as a metaphor for the evil in humanity. As such, whenever the Morah is mentioned someone will say \"the Morah comes from within.\" During the first two books the Morah is described as being a single individual responsible for all the pain and suffering in the world but in the third book it is revealed to be a legion of tormented, half-dead human souls, possibly a reference to the demonic character, \"Legion\" from \"The Bible\". In the first book Kestrel and Bowman meet an old woman in the Halls of the Morah who later appears as one of the legion of the Morah in \"Firesong\". When Bowman looks into the old woman's eyes she sees a vast congregation of smaller eyes and hears a voice in her head say \"\"We are The Morah, we are legion\"\". The Morah also is responsible for the powerful army of Zars which is the legion and can be beaten only by the Wind-Singer's song.\n\nRufy Blesh:\nAn intelligent, determined strong boy who used to be in the same class at school as Kestrel, Bowman and Mumpo. He escapes the Mastery, a consequence of which is that 20 of his people are burned to death in a monkey wagon. In Firesong it is discovered that he joined the Barra klin, a bandit tribe that lived in desert. Full of remorse for the people who died because of him, he sacrifices his life so that Kestrel and other girls can escape the Barra klin.\n\nIra Manth: Ira Manth was the first prophet of the Manth people. His followers, the Singer people, and his descendants gained his power when he died. He is only mentioned in legends in the first book, for he is long dead. Ira Hath, Pinto, Bowman, and Kestrel are all his descendants. He wrote many testaments but only one of them was ever mentioned in the book (Slaves of the Mastery): \"The Lost Testament\", believed lost until Hanno Hath finds it in the Mastery's stores. It predicts a coming storm called the Wind on Fire, and of the Manth people finding the homeland.\n\nSilman Pillish: A.K.A. Principal Pillish, He was the head of the Residential Study Course where Hanno Hath was taken in The Wind Singer. Initially, he was pleased with Hanno's work, but later when he learned of his rebellion he was disappointed. He accompanies the Haths to seek the homeland. He continuously keeps doubting Ira's ability to lead them there. In the epilogue of Firesong, he has opened a school in the homeland for all the children.\n\nOrder and control play a major role in the trilogy. They symbolize that which is at the heart of evil, and the Haths (especially Kestrel and Ira) symbolize freedom, and individuality. At the beginning of \"The Wind Singer\", Aramanth and its inhabitants are subject to a strict system, and when someone like Kestrel defies the system they are severely reprimanded, showing the grip that the Morah has on the city. The High Examiner is so bent on control that he acts almost insanely when he is crossed. He displays utter disbelief that anyone could undermine or dislike the examination system. The control is illustrated by the rules such as having everyone wear colours to define their place in society, which promotes a sense of having to conform to the group.\n\nIn \"Slaves of the Mastery\", control is achieved with fear and threats. If one person disobeys, many are killed, to discourage others from doing the same. Also, control via strength of mind features frequently, and is a skill which at the end of the book \" Firesong\" enables the Manth people to fly to their homeland. This control of oneself symbolises the liberation of the Manth people (and the world).\n\nThis is the converse side of order. The Hath family's patchwork quilt of many colours shows that they are important, as they are the only ones who seem not to be affected by the monotony that subdues the rest of the city. The Evil army, \"The Zars\", is made up of an infinite number of people who all act as one. When they march towards Aramanth there is a canyon blocking their way, which they walk straight off, knowing that eventually the pile of the dead will be high enough for the remainder of the army to walk over. The Wind Singer, with its voice returned, promotes individuality, and destroys the Zars.\n\nLikewise, The Morah is eventually revealed to be a conglomerate of souls and their violent emotions rather than an actual individual.\n\nNicholson uses powerfully emotive devices to create not only a real sense of fear amongst the characters, but also to make the reader relate directly to this strong emotion. As mentioned above, fear is used to assert control, for example Kestrel's fear of living in the dark and smelly sewer town, and also the dread which fills her when she sees the \"old children\".\n\n"}

Camphuys was born in Haarlem, in the Republic of the United Netherlands.\n\nJoannes Camphuys was born in Haarlem on 18 July 1634. In his youth he was a student at a silversmith in Amsterdam. He left on 1 November 1652 aboard the cargo carrier to India. The ship, however, suffered shipwreck on March 2, 1653 at the Shetland Islands. Camphuys survived the disaster and left on 23 August 1653 aboard the Golded Dragon. He became a clerk at the General Secretariat in Batavia and a bailiff in Batavia. After 11 years at the secreatary he became a merchant. He became a commander in 1670 and in 1671 he left as head of the VOC post in Deshima, Japan. This function was usually only carried out by government officials. After a year, as usual for that position, he returned and held the function another 2 times (in 1673 and 1675) alternated with the membership of the Council of Justice. In 1677 he became Secretary of the High Government and president of the orphan's college. He conducted negotiations with the ambassadors of Bantam. In 1678 he became Council-Extra-Oranginary of India. In 1681, he became a member of the Council of the Dutch East Indies.\n\nOn 11 January 1684 Joannes Camphuys was appointed by the Council of the Dutch East Indies as successor to Cornelis Speelman as Governor-General, initially as provisional Governor-General until the Lord XVII approved the appointment. Because a number of people felt passable in the appointment, his understanding with the Council was not optimal. He was sometimes absent and even did not decide if he did not agree with that. But the Lord XVII was on his hand and so he could go his way. Under his rule there was peace in the archipelago. On 17 December 1690 he resigned on his own repeated request. He handed over the landlord's office to Willem van Outhoorn on 24 September 1691.\n\nHe has been living alternately at Batavia, and since his farewell as Governor-General, Edam, donated to him on the coast of Batavia, where he had built a house to Japanese model and gathered animals from all parts of the Indies. He had written contact with Rumphius on Ambon. He died exactly on his 61st birthday in 1695. He was buried in the Dutch church in Batavia.\n\nCamphuys, although righteous, was not a powerful driver. His governance was not characterized by important events. Noteworthy are the Soerapati uprising on Java and the tract with Bantam of 17 April 1684. He failed to address corruption among officials. However, he had a lot of interest in science and he supported them wherever possible and also wrote a dissertation on the foundation of Batavia included in François Valentine's standard work, \"Old and New East Indies\".\n\nAt this point in Japanese history, the sole VOC outpost (or \"factory\") was situated on Dejima island in the harbor of Nagasaki on the southern island of Kyushu. Camphuys was three times sent to Japan as Opperhoofd or chief negotiant and officer of the VOC trading post. \n\nCamphuys died in Batavia (Jakarta). He is commemorated in the name of a street in the Lombok neighbourhood of Utrecht; and he is also remembered in the name of a street in the Bezuidenhoutquarter of The Hague.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1930985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930985", "title": "John C. Bennett", "text": "John C. Bennett\n\nJohn Cook Bennett (August 3, 1804 – August 5, 1867) was an American physician and briefly a ranking and influential leader of the Latter Day Saint movement, who acted as mayor of Nauvoo, Illinois, and Major-General of the Nauvoo Legion in the early 1840s.\n\nBennett's involvement in the Latter Day Saint movement came after several encounters with the community that had left him impressed. He therefore wrote several letters to Joseph Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois, in which he declared his desire to join the movement. Bennett was essential to the passing of the Nauvoo city charter in the Illinois Legislature, the provisions of which he had helped craft. He even garnered praise for his lobbying efforts on behalf of the Mormons from the young Abraham Lincoln.\n\nHis efforts on behalf of the Mormons and the long time he spent living in the Mansion House in Nauvoo secured for Bennett the confidence of Smith. Smith was instrumental in promoting Bennett to ever greater civic and ecclesiastical responsibilities in Nauvoo. Bennett became a Counselor in the First Presidency, the mayor of Nauvoo, General of the Nauvoo Legion, and the chancellor of the University of Nauvoo.\n\nBennett was excommunicated from the church for adultery on May 11, 1842. Rumors of adultery, homosexuality, and unauthorized polygamy emerged. Contemporary sources indicate that Bennett used his trusted position as a doctor to allay fears of women he attempted to seduce by telling them that he could cause abortions by administering medicine if they became pregnant.\nWhile Bennett was mayor, he was caught in private sexual relations with women in the city. He told the women that the practice, which he termed \"spiritual wifery\", was sanctioned by God and Smith and that Smith did the same. When discovered, he privately confessed his crimes, produced an affidavit that Smith had no part in his adultery, and was disciplined accordingly.\n\nAfter Bennett left Nauvoo in May 1842, he claimed he had been the target of an attempted assassination by Nauvoo Danites, who were disguised in drag. He soon became a bitter antagonist of Smith and the Latter Day Saint church, reportedly even vowing to drink the blood of Smith.\n\nIn July 1842, he wrote a series of letters to \"The Sangamo Journal\", accusing Smith of conspiring to assassinate former Missouri Governor Boggs.\n\nIn late 1842, Bennett published \"History of the Saints: Or, An Exposé of Joe Smith and Mormonism\", accusing Smith and his church of crimes including treason, conspiracy to commit murder, prostitution, and adultery, with a preface that begins: \"I have been induced to prepare and publish the following work by a desire to expose the enormous iniquities which have perpetrated by one of the grosses and most infamous impostors that ever appeared upon the face of the earth, and by many of his minions, under the name and garb of Religion, and professedly \nby the direct will and command of Almighty God.\" Through his newspaper writings and book, Bennett appeared to encourage Missouri's June 1843 attempt to extradite Smith to stand trial for treason. Ironically, Smith escaped extradition, albeit narrowly, by virtue of the powerful Nauvoo charter for which Bennett had been a principal author.\n\nIn the fall of 1843, Bennett visited George M. Hinkle, a Mormon who was excommunicated after surrendering Smith to the Missouri Militia in 1838. Bennett's subsequent letter to the editor of the \"Hawk-Eye and Iowa Patriot\" describing the Mormon \"Doctrine of Marrying for Eternity\" is the first of his writings that discusses eternal marriage, as compared to the free love/spiritual wife doctrine he previously accused Smith of practicing, in which sexual relations were not in the context of committed marriage. It is unclear whether Bennett learned of eternal marriage from Hinkle or from correspondents inside Nauvoo.\n\nBennett briefly returned to Nauvoo in December 1843, but the sole record of that visit is a notation in Smith's daybook from his general store showing a payment of the rent Bennett owed for the 39 weeks he lived in the Mansion House in 1840 to 1841. After December 1843, Bennett is recorded to have lectured only once more against Mormonism during Smith's life, in Boston, during the spring of 1844. At the 1844 Boston lecture, Bennett was not well received: he was pelted with rotten eggs and chased through Boston by the \"vast assemblage,\" which ran over several Boston police officers in the process.\n\nAfter Smith's assassination in Carthage, Illinois, on June 27, 1844, Bennett surprised many by returning briefly to Mormonism and joining forces first with Sidney Rigdon and then with James Strang, two of several Mormons contending for leadership of the movement. Bennett united with the \"Strangites,\" who founded their own Mormon community on Beaver Island in Michigan. While there, he founded a short-lived Halcyon Order of the Illuminati to reinforce Strang's power over his kingdom. With Bennett's enthusiastic support, polygamy was introduced into the Michigan Mormon community. Shortly thereafter, in 1847, amid yet more charges of sexual misconduct, Bennett was excommunicated from the Strangite community. Bennett did not associate with any Latter Day Saint group for the remainder of his life.\n\nBennett has been accused of having a part in Smith's murder, but, as his biographer Andrew F. Smith (no relation to Joseph Smith) states, based on the extant evidence, \"Bennett appears to have had no influence on the events that unfolded in Carthage during June 1844.\"\n\nBennett is often credited with introducing into Mormonism the term \"spiritual wifery,\" the term he used for both his own practice of \"free love\" and for the Nauvoo practice of plural marriage. The term was occasionally used by Mormon leaders such as Brigham Young, who spoke of the shock he received when introduced by Smith to \"the spiritual wife doctrine,\" referring to plural marriage. One of Bennett's legacies was the conflation of plural marriage with \"free love\" in the popular imagination. The term \"spiritual wifery,\" with its mixed connotations of polygyny and promiscuity, was frequently used in the national dialogue and in activism against Mormon polygamy.\n\nBennett's troubled relationship with the Mormons has overshadowed his other notable activities, including commanding a company for the Union in the American Civil War. Beginning in 1835, Bennett was an early champion of the health benefits of the tomato; a pioneer in the use of chloroform as an anesthetic, publishing his findings in 1848; and the creator of several breeds of chicken, including Plymouth Rock fowl, which he exhibited in Boston in 1849. From 1830 to 1846, Bennett worked to establish institutions of higher learning, many of which were medical colleges. Bennett's practice of \"selling diplomas\" clouds that achievement, and only one educational institution survived Bennett's connection with it.\n\nBennett left behind an extensive body of letters and published works on his various endeavors, including two books, \"History of the Saints,\" and \"The Poultry Book.\" Bennett died at 63 in Polk City, Iowa.\n\n\n\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-top: 5px solid #FABE60;\" |Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints titles\n"}
{"id": "1930989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930989", "title": "1904 Tour de France", "text": "1904 Tour de France\n\nThe 1904 Tour de France was the second Tour de France, held from 2 to 24 July. With a route similar to its previous edition, 1903 Tour de France winner Maurice Garin seemed to have repeated his win by a small margin over Lucien Pothier, while Hippolyte Aucouturier won four of the six stages. But the race became a victim of its own success, plagued by scandals; cyclists were accused of having taken trains during the race. Twelve cyclists, including the first four of the final classification and all stage winners, were disqualified by the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF). Henri Cornet, originally the fifth-place finisher, was awarded the victory four months after the race. The problems caused the Tour de France to be provisionally cancelled, and subsequently the 1905 Tour de France was run with different rules from the 1903 and 1904 editions.\n\nThe initial Tour de France of 1903 had been a large success, and it was quickly decided to organise it again in 1904. The route was identical, with the same six stages. The rules were the same as in 1903, with one exception: cyclists could not enter in just one stage, but had to join for the entire race. The favourites for the victory were Garin, Pothier and Aucouturier, who had performed well in the 1903 Tour de France. Among the competitors was Henri Paret who, at 50 years old, still holds the record of oldest Tour de France cyclist.\n\nIn the 1903 Tour de France, the organisation guaranteed that the first 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists who dropped out during the race would still get 5 francs for the days they had been in the race. This rule was added to attract cyclists who otherwise would not enter, because the Tour needed enough competitors to remain credible.\n\nIn the first stage, the riders fell after only a few kilometres. Lipman broke a finger, and became the first rider to abandon this Tour. Around 100 km in the race, Lucien Pothier lost ten minutes to the main group, led by Maurice Garin, because of a broken bicycle. In Cosne, at 174 km, Pothier had reached the leading group. Aucouturier had lost more than one hour at that point. Just before the next control post in Nevers, Aucouturier fell on his face, and continued the race covered in blood. In the last part of the race, Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier rode away from the others. They were attacked by four masked men in a car, but still finished as the first two, with Garin beating Pothier by 50 m. The many flat tires and crashes of Aucouturier, seemingly the results of sabotage, gave him a time loss of several hours.\n\nAfter the stage, three cyclists were punished: Aucouturier and Samson received fines of 500 and 250 francs, Aucouturier for having a cyclist not in the race following him, Samson for riding in the slipstream of a car. Chevallier, who had finished third, was disqualified for resting in a car for 45 minutes.\n\nDuring the stage, Ferdinand Payan had been disqualified. Some sources indicate he was helped by a motor, other that he was helped by riders not in the race.\nIn that first stage, Garin had asked the race official Lefèvre for food, which was illegal. Lefèvre, who knew that Garin was the star of the race, broke the rules and gave him the food, because he did not want to be responsible for Garin leaving the race because of hunger.\nThe news that Garin had received illegal help quickly spread, and caused the fanatical crowd to take action.\n\nFor the second stage, the organisers had made the option to postpone the start by two hours, in case the mistral wind was making cycling difficult. This was not necessary, so the riders started at midnight as planned.\n\nDuring this stage, Antoine Fauré lead close to his hometown, and 200 fans tried to stop the rest of the cyclists from following him. Garin hurt his hand during the incident, and Giovanni Gerbi was knocked unconscious, and had to give up with broken fingers. The situation was only solved after race officials fired shots in the air. Further on, nails and broken glass had been spread along the road, which caused many flat tires. Because of this help, Fauré was the first on top of the Col de la République, but was taken over by the favourites later. Aucouturier won the sprint. When the riders reached Marseille, they complained that there had been too many incidents in this stage, and the stage results should be cancelled. In the last part, they had been stopped by a large group of cyclists. Maurice Garin had been attacked, and his arm had been injured: he finished the stage steering with only one hand. There was so much confusion at the last controle post, that the exact arrival times of the cyclists were not recorded.\n\nIn the third stage, the Tour reached Nîmes, near the home town of Payan, whose fans were angry because of his disqualification. They threw rocks at the riders, and barricaded the road. The cyclists had troubles passing through Nîmes, and several were injured. The most important event for the general classification was when César Garin's bicycle was broken by attackers; he had to find a new bicycle, which took him 15 minutes. Further on, nails and broken glass were spread along the road. Many riders punctured, but there were no serious falls. The cyclists passed this part walking. After Nîmes, a leading group of five cyclists was formed: Maurice Garin, Pothier, Aucouturier, Cornet and Beaugendre. Aucouturier and Cornet escaped, and Aucouturier won, beating Cornet in the sprint.\n\nThe fourth stage was run without the incidents that plagued the first three stages. Pothier, Maurice and César Garin and Beaugendre reached Bordeaux together, and the stage was decided by the final kilometre in the velodrome, where Pothier recorded the fastest time.\n\nIn the fifth stage, nails on the road again causing punctures. As mechanical assistance was not allowed, Cornet had to ride the last 40 km on two flat tires. Aucouturier won this stage, his third one, but was way behind in the general classification, which Garin lead, with only 28 seconds margin to Pothier.\n\nIn the sixth stage, Aucouturier, Garin and Dortignac escaped in the last kilometres. Aucouturier signed first at the control post in Ville-d'Avray. From that point, the race was neutralised until the velodrome Parc-des-Princes, where the riders would ride the final kilometre. At the moment that the riders arrived in Paris, it started to rain. The organisers decided together with the cyclists to exclude the final kilometre from the race, and make the control post in Ville-d'Avray the end of the race. This made Aucouturier the winner of the stage. Maurice Garin finished second, which made him the overall winner.\n\nInitially, Maurice Garin was the winner, having led the race from start to end. Hippolyte Aucouturier won four stages. In total, 27 cyclists finished.\nFor each cyclist, the times they had needed in each stage was added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time after the last stage was the winner.\n\nDuring the race, nine riders were excluded because of, among other actions, illegal use of cars or trains. The Tour organisers were happy with the result, but the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF) started an investigation after complaints from other cyclists. Their investigative committee heard testimony from dozens of competitors and witnesses, and, in December 1904, disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers (Maurice Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Aucouturier). Ten of those disqualified were banned for one year, Maurice Garin for two years and the remaining two for life. In total, 29 riders were punished.\nThe reasons for the disqualification were never made public.\n\nFifth-placed Henri Cornet, aged 19, then became the youngest ever winner of the Tour. Cornet had also been warned after he had received a lift by a car. Only 15 cyclists from the original 27 that finished were not disqualified.\n\nFollowing the disqualifications, the Tour de France came nearest in history to being permanently cancelled. The race organiser Henri Desgrange, said he would never run the race again because it had been overtaken by the \"blind emotions\" of those who attacked or helped riders as they passed. Desgrange was also upset that the UVF had imposed judgement on his race when he had already disciplined riders as he saw fit.\n\nAn angry exchange ensued between Desgrange and the UVF but the letters and the detailed complaints that led to the UVF's actions were lost when the Tour de France archives were transported south in 1940 to avoid the German invasion and were never seen again.\n\nUntil the end of his life, Garin always said that he was the rightful winner of the 1904 Tour de France, but according to Les Woodland, Garin confessed to a friend that he had cheated.\n\nAfter the disqualifications, the first four cyclists of the initial classification were disqualified. In the new classification, only 15 cyclists had finished:\n\nBecause of the scandals associated with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race. He however changed his mind, and the rules were changed to prevent cyclists from cheating: the 1905 Tour de France would be decided with a points system. Tour de France 1904 winner Cornet would enter the Tour de France for seven more times, but would never again play an important role.\n\n"}

{"id": "1931006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931006", "title": "John Laurinaitis", "text": "John Laurinaitis\n\nJohn Hodger Laurinaitis (born July 31, 1962), also known as Johnny Ace, is an American senior producer and retired professional wrestler, currently employed by WWE.\n\nHe has wrestled for such promotions as World Championship Wrestling (WCW), All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and WWE. He is the brother of Joe (Road Warrior Animal; one half of the former wrestling tag team The Road Warriors) and Marcus, and is also the uncle of James Laurinaitis, former National Football League player. In WWE, Laurinaitis worked in the talent relations office for eight years, and as occasional wrestler from 2011 until 2012. After his on screen firing, he stepped down from his corporate backstage role to being a producer. Prior to joining WWE, Laurinaitis worked as an executive for WCW.\n\nJohn Laurinaitis started wrestling in 1986 as Johnny Ace. At first, while wrestling in Florida Championship Wrestling, Ace frequently teamed with his brother The Terminator. Later, when he wrestled for NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions he formed a tag team with Shane Douglas called \"The Dynamic Dudes\". They were managed by Jim Cornette until Cornette turned on them for Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane's version of The Midnight Express. Prior to entering the competition as one of The Dynamic Dudes at the NWA, he appeared as a flagbearer for the team of The Sheepherders. In his last televised WCW match, Ace lost to Mean Mark Callous, later known as The Undertaker, at Capital Combat on May 19, 1990.\n\nAs All Japan Pro Wrestling was cutting its ties with the NWA in 1990, Laurinaitis chose to stay in it, thus becoming a permanent foreign fixture on the roster. In AJPW, he found a lot of success, teaming with Kenta Kobashi, \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams and Bart Gunn.\n\nLaurinaitis enjoyed significant championship success and acclaim during his tenure, becoming a two-time All Asia Tag Team Champion, a four-time World Tag Team Champion, and the winner of the New Year's Heavyweight Battle Royal on January 2, 1991 at Korakuen Hall. He won two \"5 Star Match\" awards and one \"Match of the Year\" award from the \"Wrestling Observer\", and was ranked #77 in \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\"'s (PWI) top 500 wrestlers for 1997. On February 28, 1998, Laurinaitis would reach the highest point of his singles career as he challenged Mitsuharu Misawa for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. It would be Laurinaitis' only shot at those three prestigious belts. Following his retirement in 2000, he was placed #203 in PWI's top 500 all time rankings.\n\nLaurinaitis retired from the ring in 2000 after the split between All Japan Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Noah. He soon returned to World Championship Wrestling where he replaced Vince Russo as head booker. Laurinaitis was responsible for booking the highly acclaimed one-night single elimination tournament held for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship that was won by the debuting Lance Storm.\n\nLaurinaitis was hired in as a road agent after WWF's acquisition of certain assets of WCW in March 2001 and in June on the same year, Laurinaitis was promoted to Director of Talent Relations. In June 2004, Laurinaitis replaced Jim Ross as Vice President of Talent Relations, then being promoted to Senior Vice President in February 2007 and finally to Executive Vice President in March 2009. However, when Stephanie McMahon took over Talent Relations and handed over the reins to Paul Levesque, Laurinaitis moved down from his executive duties to being Senior Vice President of Talent Operations. Laurinaitis's tenure in this role has received criticism from those who have worked for him, including Jim Cornette who, in his interviews with Kayfabe Commentaries, described how Laurinaitis failed to work in the same capacity with Ohio Valley Wrestling (WWE's developmental territory) as Ross did, often failing to warn the promotion when wrestlers OVW were using at the time were going to be called up to the main roster or when wrestlers from the main roster were set to appear for OVW but never did. Eventually WWE would end their relationship with OVW.\n\nFollowing his tenure as an on-screen performer in 2012, Laurinaitis was relieved of his backstage executive duties and returned to his original role as a road agent.\n\nOn the June 27, 2011 episode of \"Raw\", Laurinaitis was described by CM Punk during his infamous 'pipe bomb' promo as a \"glad-handing, nonsensical, douchebag yes-man\" who would \"tell Vince McMahon everything he wants to hear\". Laurinaitis subsequently made an appearance alongside McMahon as a corporate stooge during the main event of the Money in the Bank pay-per-view the following month. At the climax of the WWE Championship match, under McMahon's orders, Laurinaitis tried to duplicate the Montreal Screwjob, but defending WWE Champion John Cena then proceeded to knock Laurinaitis out, not wanting to win the match that way. This interference allowed CM Punk to win the match and the championship. The next night on \"Raw\", Laurinaitis appeared alongside McMahon as McMahon announced an 8-man tournament to decide a new WWE Champion following Punk's departure from the company. On the August 1 episode of \"Raw\", Laurinaitis interrupted Triple H, telling him to strip Cena of his WWE Championship, which led Cena to interrupt him and threaten to hit him again before Laurinaitis fled the ring. The following week on \"Raw\", Laurinaitis helped Triple H officiate the contract signing between CM Punk and John Cena for their match at SummerSlam. After signing the contract, Cena flipped the table over and moved to go face to face with Punk, but was stopped by Laurinaitis. As Laurinaitis talked to Cena, Punk kicked Laurinaitis in the back of the head, causing Cena to accidentally hit Triple H instead of Punk.\n\nFollowing Summerslam, Laurinaitis began to make regular appearances on WWE programming as part of an angle in which Triple H attempted to find out who had sent a text message to the returning Kevin Nash telling him to attack CM Punk after his victory at Summerslam, causing him to lose the WWE Championship to Alberto Del Rio who cashed in his Money in the Bank contract immediately afterwards. On the August 15 episode of \"Raw\", Laurinaitis asked Nash for a private meeting in his office, and on the September 5 episode of \"Raw\", after Triple H fired Nash, Laurinaitis was seen entering Nash's limo with him, leaving the arena. During this period Laurinaitis was also regularly shown sending text messages backstage and at ringside. After Nash claimed that he had sent the text message to himself, it was implied that Laurinaitis was working to try and undermine Triple H in his new role as Chief Operating Officer, presumably because he wanted the job for himself. At Night of Champions, Laurinaitis interfered in the main event in an attempt to have Triple H removed from power but was stopped by The Miz and R-Truth, who attacked both Triple H and CM Punk, believing there to be a conspiracy. Nash also interfered in the match after Laurinaitis sent a text at ringside.\n\nOn the September 26 episode of \"Raw\", Laurinaitis acquired David Otunga, a Harvard Law School graduate, as his legal counsel and, as part of his kayfabe duties as Executive Vice President of Talent Relations, assigned Otunga to assemble Superstars that were disgruntled with Triple H's actions as COO. On that week's edition of \"SmackDown\", Laurinaitis and Otunga sat down with Christian, Cody Rhodes, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger and Vickie Guerrero to discuss the matter.\nOn the October 10 edition of \"Raw\", following a kayfabe strike by members of the WWE roster as a result of Triple H's management, Vince McMahon introduced Laurinaitis as the new Interim General Manager of \"Raw\". That same night, Laurinaitis fired Jim Ross and reinstated The Miz and R-Truth, who had been suspended following repeated attacks. After a few weeks of impartiality during which he pledged that he would listen to the WWE fans using his slogan of \"People Power\", Laurinaitis began showing bias against WWE Champion CM Punk, who had repeatedly criticized Laurinaitis and questioned his integrity over the past few months. On the December 26 edition of \"Raw\", Laurinaitis placed Punk in a gauntlet match against three opponents; whoever pinned Punk would earn a shot at the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble. Punk agreed to the match under the condition that if he beat all three, then he would receive a match against Laurinaitis himself afterwards. During the match, Laurinaitis distracted Punk, allowing Dolph Ziggler to pin Punk and earn a title shot. The following week on \"Raw\", Laurinaitis distracted Punk once again, causing him to be counted-out in his title match against Ziggler, thus retaining the championship. Laurinaitis then scheduled a WWE Championship match between Punk and Ziggler at the Royal Rumble, in which he named himself guest referee. Laurinaitis continued to cause Punk to lose to Ziggler throughout January which ultimately led to Punk attacking Laurinaitis in retaliation, claiming that he was abusing his power. Laurinaitis began to declare himself as the \"soon to be permanent\" General Manager. In response to this, the Board of Directors ordered that his position as Interim General Manager would be taken under review by Chief Operating Officer Triple H. At the Royal Rumble, Laurinaitis brought in another official and Punk defeated Ziggler. On January 30 edition of \"Raw\", Laurinaitis was set to have a performance review by Triple H. During the review, Triple H degraded Laurinaitis and his actions, but before the final decision he was interrupted by The Undertaker. The Board of Directors then decided on February 7, 2012 to retain Laurinaitis as Interim General Manager.\n\nLaurinaitis subsequently began a feud with \"SmackDown\" general manager Theodore Long. The respective General Managers of Raw and SmackDown swapped places for one night only with Laurinaitis in charge of SmackDown for March 9, 2012 and Long in charge of Raw for March 5, 2012. On that week's edition of SmackDown, Laurinaitis wrestled his first match in eleven years (as well as his first for WWE), losing to Theodore Long in a singles match. Laurinaitis continued his feud with Long until WrestleMania XXVIII, where both Long and Laurinaitis chose a team of six wrestlers to represent them, with the winning team earning General Manager control over both brands. Team Johnny defeated Team Teddy, resulting in Long losing his position as General Manager of \"SmackDown\". On the April 6, 2012 edition of \"SmackDown,\" Laurinaitis forced Long to become his new assistant after threatening to discontinue Long's grandchildren's trust fund. On the April 23, 2012 episode of \"Raw,\" Laurinaitis appointed Eve Torres as Executive Administrator of \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown.\"\n\nOn the April 30, 2012 episode of \"Raw,\" Laurinaitis, with the aid of Tensai, attacked John Cena, before declaring himself as Cena's opponent at Over the Limit. On the May 14 episode of \"Raw,\" Laurinaitis publicly humiliated and fired Big Show from the WWE after Show disrespected him for constantly making fun of his voice. That same night, the Board of Directors sent Laurinaitis a letter stating that he would be fired if he lost the no disqualification match against Cena at Over the Limit. At the pay-per-view, Laurinaitis defeated Cena despite taking a heavy beating after Big Show interfered and attacked Cena. The following night on \"Raw\", Laurinaitis, now using a power chair and crutches for mobility purposes, rehired Show after helping him win the match against Cena.\n\nOn the June 11, 2012 episode of \"Raw\", Vince McMahon gave Laurinaitis a job evaluation. Before McMahon could fire Laurinaitis, Big Show hit the \"WMD\" on McMahon by accident. At No Way Out, Cena defeated Show in a Steel Cage match. After the match, McMahon fired Laurinaitis, followed by Cena hitting the \"Attitude Adjustment\" on Laurinaitis through a broadcast table. The next night on \"Raw\", in his final show in charge, Laurinaitis booked himself in a 3-on-1 Handicap Match, teaming up with Big Show and David Otunga against Cena. During the match, both Show and Otunga walked out on Laurinaitis, which allowed Cena to hit Laurinaitis with three \"Attitude Adjustment\"s before making him submit to the STF.\n\nOn the March 29, 2013 episode of SmackDown, Laurinaitis offered The Rock his services as manager for his match at WrestleMania 29 against John Cena. Rock responded by giving Laurinaitis a Spinebuster and a People's Elbow. Laurinaitis appeared at Survivor Series, alongside Los Matadores, R-Truth, Santino Marella and Fandango, and at the 2013 Slammy Awards, presenting the Rookie of the Year award to The Shield.\n\nOn \"SmackDown's 15th Anniversary Special\" on October 10, 2014, Laurinaitis formed a team to face Teddy Long's team to be determined as the greatest GM in SmackDown history. The match was won by Teddy Long's team. He appeared at the Slammy Awards in December and, on March 28, 2015 he inducted The Bushwhackers into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nPreceding the return of the brand split, Laurinaitis was one of several former authority figures to unsuccessfully apply for the general manager positions of either \"Raw\" or \"SmackDown\". He made his appearance during the June 20, 2016 episode of \"Raw\" but was escorted off the stage by Shane McMahon.\n\nOn January 22, 2018, Laurinaitis was one of the guests that appeared on stage during the 25th Anniversary episode of \"Raw\".\n\nOn May 10, 2020, Laurinaitis appeared in the first ever simultaneous Men and Women's Money in the Bank match, in the WWE HQ he was hit with a pie during the match.\n\nLaurinaitis' brothers Joe, who is Animal of The Road Warriors, and Marcus were also professional wrestlers. He is also the uncle of James Laurinaitis, former linebacker for the St. Louis Rams and New Orleans Saints.\n\nOn September 3, 2015, Laurinaitis became engaged to Kathy Colace, who is the mother of the Bella Twins and the mother-in-law of former WWE champion Daniel Bryan. The two were married in a private ceremony on March 24, 2016.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1931027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931027", "title": "Born to Make You Happy", "text": "Born to Make You Happy\n\n\"Born to Make You Happy\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her debut studio album, \"...Baby One More Time\" (1999). It was released on December 6, 1999, by Jive Records, as the fourth single from the album in European countries. Spears —whose vision for her sound differed stylistically from that of her producer's— was unhappy with the sexual overtones of the song, and the song underwent at least one re-write before its release. The singer first recorded the vocals for the track in March 1998, which were later re-recorded the same year. The pop and teen pop song alludes to a relationship that a woman desires to correct, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that she was \"born to make [her lover] happy\".\n\n\"Born to Make You Happy\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised Spears' vocals and deemed it an early classic and a proficient single, but criticized its message. The song was commercially successful worldwide, peaking at number one in Ireland, and reaching top five positions in Belgium, Europe, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Sweden and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, it also peaked at number one, and is Spears' sixth best-selling single in the country. An accompanying music video was directed by Billie Woodruff, and portrays Spears dreaming that she is with her lover, while she sings and dances during the majority of the video. Spears has performed \"Born to Make You Happy\" on four concert tours.\n\nBefore recording her debut album, Spears had originally envisioned it in style of \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger [and] more adult contemporary\". However, the singer agreed with her label's appointment of producers, who had the objective to reach a teen public at the time. She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from May 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. \"Born to Make You Happy\" was written and produced by Kristian Lundin, and co-written by Andreas Carlsson, and was the first work by the duo. Spears originally recorded the vocals for the song in 1998, at Battery Studios in New York City, New York. They were later re-recorded in May 1998 at Cheiron Studios, and used on the album version, while the original vocals were used on the \"Bonus Remix\" of the song. It was also mixed at Cheiron Studios by Max Martin. Esbjörn Öhrwall played the guitar, while keyboards and programming was done by Lundin. Background vocals were provided by Carlsson and Nana Hedin. \"Born to Make You Happy\" was released in Europe as the fourth single from \"...Baby One More Time\" on December 6, 1999. It was not released as a single in the United States, where \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" was released as the album's fourth single instead.\n\n\"Born to Make You Happy\" is a teen pop and pop song that lasts for four minutes and three seconds. The song is composed in the key of B minor and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderately slow tempo of 88 beats per minute. Spears vocal range spans over an octave, from F to B. The song's lyrics are about a relationship that a woman desires to correct, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that \"I don't know how to live without your love/I was born to make you happy\". Writing for \"Pink News\", Mayer Nissim described its lyrics as being about \"capturing that pain, denial, and self-pitying misery right after things go south\". \"Born to Make You Happy\" has a basic sequence of Bm–G–D–A as its chord progression.\n\nDavid Gauntlett, author of \"Media, gender, and identity: an introduction\" (2002), noted that, despite wanting her lover next to her in the song, Spears' \"fans see her as assertive, strong and confident, and an example that young women can make it on their own\". The singer revealed in an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", the writers had to re-write the original lyrics of the song. \"I asked them to change the words to 'Born to Make You Happy.' It was a sexual song,\" she revealed. \"I said, 'This may be a little old for me.' Because of the image thing, I don't want to go over the top. If I come out being Miss Prima Donna, that wouldn't be smart. I want to have a place to grow\".\n\n\"Born to Make You Happy\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Kyle Anderson of MTV considered the song's chorus more than \"a little bit off-putting,\" saying the first lines of it \"could be a sentiment that a lovelorn 16-year-old can understand, but it also sounds like Spears is in training to be a geisha\". Craig MacInnis of \"Hamilton Spectator\" said \"[\"Born to Make You Happy\"] verges on the sort of boy-worshipping dreck that even Tiffany would have sniffed at\". Mike Ross of \"Edmond Sun\" said, as Spears emotes in the song, \"the message behind the music is worse than mere sweet nothings. [...] So much for Girl Power\". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic considered \"Born to Make You Happy\" a \"proficient but entirely unrememberable song,\" while Andy Petch-Jex of musicOMH considered the song an \"early classic\". Christopher Rosa, from \"Glamour\", deemed it Spears' tenth best song, calling it an \"euphoric slice of late nineties bubblegum, featuring some of her fullest vocals and one of her most memorable bridges\". Shannon Barbour from \"Cosmopolitan\" called it a \"prime stare-out-the-widow-pretending-to-be-in-an-emotional-music-video song\". Digital Spy's Alim Kheraj praised \"Spears' pure vocals and the dreamlike production\".\n\nFor Alex Macpherson from \"The Guardian\", it's one of the best examples of Spears' \"distressing vulnerability\" as well as her best song; \"a determined erasure of the autonomous self [...] 'Born to Make You Happy' is horrifying as text and irresistible as pop, and the two are inextricable\". While reviewing \"...Baby One More Time\" on its 20th anniversary, \"Billboard\"s Chuck Arnold felt that \"the old-fashioned sentiment of this song - that a girl is born to please her guy - feels even more antiquated 20 years later. Still, this song is a teen-pop dream\". For Daniel Megarry from \"Gay Times\", it was one of the \"standout tracks\" from \"...Baby One More Time\" and wrote that \"it’s impossible not to feel nostalgia when the melancholic beats of 'Born To Make You Happy' grace your eardrums\". Mayer Nissim pointed out that \"on the surface the lyrics are more than a little limp and pathetic, but [...] the powerful pop backing and unbreaking vocals show that Britney will more than live to fight (and love) another day\". Nicholas Hautman, from \"Us Weekly\", said that the song \"may not have aged well, but there is no question that it has some of Spears' best vocals\".\n\nOn January 29, 2000, \"Born to Make You Happy\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song shipped over 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom, earning a silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). \"Born to Make You Happy\" has sold over 325,000 copies in the United Kingdom, according to The Official Charts Company. It is her sixth best-selling single in the country. In Ireland, the song also entered the Irish Singles Chart at number one on January 20, 2000, while peaking at number two on the European chart. In Sweden, \"Born to Make You Happy\" debuted at number four on December 23, 1999, peaking at number two in the following week. The song has shipped over 30,000 copies in the country, earning a platinum certification by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). In Germany, the song earned a gold certification by The Federal Association of Music Industry (BMVI), after peaking at number three on the charts. In France, \"Born to Make You Happy\" reached number nine, and was certified Silver by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP).\n\nJIVE Records commissioned a music video for the song to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson. The narrative of the video shows Spears dreaming as she sleeps in her room. As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts her feet on the wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video. As the video continues, Spears is seen on top of the apartment building she lives in, performing a dance segment in a red top and black skirt with a few backup dancers. The following scenes shows the singer wearing white clothes and singing in the room in which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes into her room to see her. Together, they start a pillow fight that shortly ends after Spears is shown again in her room still sleeping, however, now with a smile upon her face. A longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.\n\nAnna Ben Yehuda, from \"Time Out\" magazine, called it Spears' eleventh best video; \"we don't know why Brit is dreaming of herself making someone happy by dancing on a stage in space, but we don't care, because that choreography is \"dope\"\". Negative criticism came from \"Bustle\"s Kaitlin Reilly, who panned it as \"patently ridiculous\".\n\nBritney performs the song for the very first time at her \"The Hair Zone Mall Tour\" (promotional mini tour) in New York City, USA at July 1, 1998. \"Born to Make You Happy\" has been performed by Spears on four tours. On her first big tour, ...Baby One More Time Tour, she sang the song seated on a staircase, while on her second tour, Crazy 2k Tour, the performance of the song included a full dance segment. On 2000s Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, Spears performed \"Born to Make You Happy\" wearing pajamas and slippers, with a dance segment near the end. \"Born to Make You Happy\" was performed for the last time on Dream Within a Dream Tour, where Spears emerged from the middle of a giant musical box on the stage as a ballerina, to perform the song in a medley with \"Lucky\" and \"Sometimes\", right after the performance of \"Overprotected\". Spears also performed \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" and \"Born to Make You Happy\" on \"Disney Channel in Concert\" in 1999. The performances were recorded and included on Spears' first home video release, \"Time Out with Britney Spears\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:\n\n"}

It is the first book of the trilogy: Wind On Fire. It follows the quest of twins Kestrel and Bowman Hath, and their acquaintance Mumpo to restore the \"Voice of the Wind Singer\" to their city and bring happiness to their cruel society. \"The Wind Singer\" won the 2000 Nestlé Smarties Book Prize and the Blue Peter Best Book Award for \"The Book I Couldn't Put Down\".\n\nThe book begins in the walled city of Aramanth, an extreme meritocracy where endless exams and ratings are the only way to move forward to improved life stations; to be unsuccessful in this is seen as a great source of shame. Using a system based on colour classifications, the governing Examiners dictate what people can wear, where they can live and what jobs they can do. The levels are grey, maroon, orange, scarlet and white, with the muddy Underlake the lowest and white the highest. The Emperor is the only person allowed to wear blue.\n\nA minority in their society, the Haths believe more in ideas and dreams than in endless toil and ratings. When young Kestrel defies the harsh classification system of Aramanth she flees, finding herself in the company of the Emperor of Aramanth. Thought to be the ruler of the city, he is found to be merely a puppet of the High Examiner, and the Emperor tells Kestrel of the need to rid Aramanth of the influence of the evil Morah, of the need to return the voice to the mysterious Wind Singer that stands in the city arena.\n\nUsing an archaic map given to her by the Emperor she sets off, joined by her twin brother, Bowman, and their brave but pitiful new friend, Mumpo, who has an unshakeable affection for Kestrel. They meet a variety of tribes and individuals including the fearsome nomadic clans of Ombaraka and Omchaka. The journey eventually leads them to the Halls of the Morah; the very heart of the evil that has taken control of the city. Here the children finally retrieve the voice of the Wind Singer, in the process waking the terrible Zars, an army of the Morah. Pursued by the beautiful, evil and unstoppable Zars, the children race back to Aramanth, arriving just in time to return the Wind Singer's voice. The voice allows the Wind Singer to emit a powerful song that destroys the Zars and saves Aramanth.\n\n\n"}

He attended Ohio University. After studying law in St. Louis, Missouri, he was admitted to the bar. In addition to practicing law, he engaged in mercantile pursuits in Carrollton, Illinois.\n\nSharon moved to California in 1849, accompanied by his friend John Douglas Fry (July 1, 1819 – February 3, 1901). Sharon and Fry engaged in business together for a short time in Sacramento. Sharon then moved to San Francisco in 1850, where he dealt in real estate. In 1852, he married Maria Malloy (Quebec, 1832 – San Francisco, May 14, 1875). He moved to Virginia City, Nevada in 1864 as manager of the branch of the Bank of California and became interested in silver mining.\n\nSharon was a business partner of Darius Mills and William Ralston, as well as the Nevada agent for the Bank of California. The bank profited greatly from loaning money to mining and milling operations and then foreclosing on those operations when the owners defaulted. The Bank of California owned mines as well as reduction mills, which Sharon controlled. In his efforts to monopolize the Comstock mining region, Sharon directed mined ore be sent to this mill or that, and affectively “starved out” competition, i.e. those who had come to the bank for loans. The bank also built and owned the famous V&T.\n\nWilliam Sharon acquired many of Ralston's assets in 1875 when Ralston's financial empire collapsed and he died. He was thought by some of his contemporaries to have actually aided the collapse. He certainly was the main beneficiary of Ralston's assets. Those assets included the Palace Hotel in San Francisco and Ralston Hall in Belmont, California.\n\nHis daughter Clara married Francis G. Newlands, who became a Congressman and Senator from Nevada. He was also the father of Florence Emily Sharon, who married Sir Thomas George Fermor-Hesketh, 7th Baronet.\n\nHe was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate from Nevada and served from March 4, 1875 to March 3, 1881. He served as the chairman of the Committee on Mines and Mining in the 45th United States Congress.\n\nSharon spent the majority of his term in office living in California, missing more than 90% of votes.\n\nSarah Althea Hill was a 30 year old mentally unstable woman with a history of violent behavior. She carried a small-caliber Colt revolver in her purse and did not hesitate to threaten all who crossed her. She attracted the attention of 60 year old Sharon. He was at the time reportedly earning over $100,000 per month. He gave her $500 (about $) a month and a room in the San Francisco Grand Hotel, adjoining the Palace Hotel where he lived, and enjoyed her companionship from time to time. After just over a year, he tried to end the relationship, but she would not allow it, and kept inviting herself to his office and sent repeated pleas for him to reconsider his decision. He finally evicted her from her room by having the carpets ripped up and the door hinges removed, along with a $7,500 (around $) payment.\n\nWhen he began a relationship with another woman, she claimed to be his wife and sued him for adultery. One of her attorneys was former Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court David S. Terry. Sharon countersued, claiming that the marriage contract she produced was fraudulent.\n\nAs was the custom at the time, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen J. Field was assigned to assist the California Circuit Court. He was assigned to the Sharon vs. Sharon case. Coincidentally, Fields had in 1859 replaced David Terry on the California Supreme Court after Terry killed California United States Senator David Colbreth Broderick in a duel. Although he was not charged with a crime, he resigned and left the state.\n\nAfter William Sharon died on November 13, 1885, his son and son-in-law carried on the case. Hill produced a handwritten will that she said she had found in his desk. Many were suspicious of its authenticity. It gave her all of Sharon's estate. She soon married her attorney Terry.\n\nIn January 1886, a U.S. Circuit Court Judge and a U.S. District Court Judge sitting as a Circuit Judge rendered a decision that the marriage contract was a forgery. The Terrys were jailed when they refused to comply with the Court's order to give the court the marriage contract. They returned to the court in March 1888, seeking further relief. Oral arguments was heard before Justice Stephen J. Field, sitting as Circuit Court Justice, Circuit Court Judge Lorenzo Sawyer, and District Court Judge George Myron Sabin. The Court took the matter under advisement. After the court hearing, Judge Sawyer encountered the Terrys on a train between Fresno and San Francisco on August 14, 1888. When Terry and his wife saw Sawyer on the train, she personally threatened to kill Sawyer.\n\nOn September 3, 1888, Field delivered the final Circuit Court opinion. He ruled that the will was a forgery. Sarah Althea Hill Sharon Terry suddenly stood up, screamed obscenities at the judge, and fumbled in her handbag for her revolver. When Marshal John Franks and others attempted to escort her from the courtroom, attorney Terry rose to defend his wife and went for his Bowie knife. He hit Franks, knocking out a tooth, and the marshals drew their handguns. Spectators subdued Terry and led him out of the courtroom, where he pulled his Bowie knife again and threatened all around him. David Neagle was among the Marshals present and put his pistol in Terry's face. Both Terrys were subdued and placed under arrest. Justice Field had them returned to the courtroom and sentenced both to jail for contempt of court. David Terry got six months in jail, and Sarah Terry got one month.\n\nWhile being transported to jail and while serving their sentences, Terry and his wife repeatedly threatened to kill Judge Field. The Terrys suffered several more setbacks. Both David and Althea were indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal charges arising out of their behavior in the courtroom before Justice Field. In May 1889, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the order that invalidated Althea Terry's marriage contract with Senator Sharon. Then, in July, with only one of the four judges who had earlier ruled in their favor, the California Supreme Court reversed itself. It ruled that because Althea Terry and Sharon had kept their alleged marriage a secret, they were never legally married. While in jail or shortly afterward, pregnant Althea suffered a miscarriage.\n\nThe newspapers followed the case closely and repeatedly speculated about the likelihood of an attack on Field. When Field returned to California as a circuit riding judge for the 9th Circuit Court again the next year, U.S. Attorney General William Miller instructed Marshal Franks to appoint Neagle as a Marshal with the responsibility to protect Field.\n\nWhen Terry and Hill were released, they returned to Fresno. On August 14, 1889, they boarded a train in Fresno on which Field and Neagle were returning from Los Angeles. At 7:10 am, all of the passengers disembarked the train to eat breakfast in the railroad station dining room at Lathrop, California. The conductor immediately sent word to Constable Walker that both men were on board and requested that he come at once to the railroad station, but he couldn't be found right away. When Terry saw Field, he slowly came across the dining room and approached Field from the rear. The account in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" the next day reported that Terry slapped Field on his cheek. Other reports said Terry attempted to slap Field, or to grab him by the whiskers.\n\nNeagle, who was 5'7\" tall and weighed 145 pounds, testified that the 6'3\", 250-pound Terry recognized Neagle from the earlier confrontation in the courtroom. Neagle rose from his chair and said, \"Stop that! I am an officer.\" When Terry drew back his fist to deliver another blow, Neagle shot Terry in the heart at point-blank range with a 45 caliber revolver. As Terry fell backward, Neagle fired again, nicking his ear. Neagle announced to the 80 to 100 people in the dining room, \"I am a United States Marshal and I defy anyone to touch me!\" Field told them that Terry had assaulted him \"and my officer shot him.\"\n\nNeagle and Field reboarded the train and locked themselves in their cabin. Sarah Terry attempted tried to enter their car, saying she wished to slap Field. Neagle insisted that she be kept out or he would kill her too. The satchel she had fetched from the train was searched and a pistol was found within it. A few minutes later Constable Walker of Lathrop and Stanislaus County Sheriff Purvis arrived. Neagle provided a document issued by the U.S. Attorney General appointing him as a special Marshal to protect Field. Walker arrested Neagle and took him to the county jail in Stockton. Neagle refused to say anything about the shooting. San Joaquin County Sheriff Thomas Cunningham telegrammed San Francisco officers and sought Field's arrest on his arrival in Oakland. This was not done. Judge Fields telegraphed the Marshal's office in Stockton, who relayed the information to the US Attorney General. The United States Attorney in San Francisco filed a writ of habeas corpus for Neagle's release. The circuit court issued the writ after a hearing and ordered Neagle's release.\n\nSheriff Cunningham, with the aid of the State of California, appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Cunningham's appeal was based on whether Neagle acted in pursuance of the law when he shot Terry. Neagle's defense was based on the letter from Miller to Marshal Franks, which gave him federal authority to act as a law enforcement officer. In 1890, the Supreme Court ruled \"In re Neagle\" that federal officers are immune from state prosecution for actions taken within the scope of their federal authority.\n\nSarah Terry, widowed by her husband's death, gradually went insane. She wandered the streets of San Francisco aimlessly, ignoring her appearance. She constantly talked to \"spirits,\" especially that of her husband. She was diagnosed with “dementia praecox,” an early term for schizophrenia. On March 2, 1892, she was found insane and committed at age 42 to the California Asylum at Stockton, where she lived for 45 years until her death.\n\nSharon was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco.\n\nThe prolonged legal battle over the Sharon fortune was the inspiration for Eleazar Lipsky's novel \"The Devil's Daughter\" (1969).\n\n\n"}

The station is located on the West Coast Main Line about northwest of London. The station is served by Avanti West Coast intercity services, and by West Midlands Trains and Southern regional services. \n\nThis station is one of the six stations serving the Milton Keynes urban area. Milton Keynes Central, which opened on 17 May 1982, is by far the busiest and most important of these, as well as being the largest in terms of platforms in use, having overtaken when platforms 2A and 6 became operational.\n\nA new station to delimit the western end of the new central business district of Milton Keynes was a key objective for Milton Keynes Development Corporation (MKDC). In the cash-strapped circumstances of the mid 1970s, British Rail (BR) was unenthusiastic but eventually came round after a deal was done in 1978 on cost sharing. In 1979, MKDC architect Stuart Mosscrop designed the station building and office blocks to either side, framing a new Station Square and the vista uphill along Midsummer Boulevard (and the midsummer sunrise).\nBR brought the station into operation on 14 May 1982 in an official ceremony with full public opening by Charles, Prince of Wales three days later. The adjacent office wings were completed three years later. Before it opened, Bletchley railway station was the main station for Milton Keynes, served by British Rail InterCity services. These services moved to the new station, downgrading Bletchley.\n\nIn May 2006, the Department of Transport announced a plan to upgrade the station. The first phase added a down fast line platform 6, so that the existing platform 5 could be used for stopping express trains in either direction. The second phase provided an additional terminating bay platform (2A), nominally to extend the Marston Vale Line / service via the West Coast Main Line (WCML) to Milton Keynes Central. This 5-car bay platform is indented into platform 1. The original platform 1 line was extended northwards from 'bay' to 'through' (becoming the up slow line), and platform 2 line is now a 'centre' terminating and reversing line, avoiding conflicting crossing movements. This work was completed on 29 December 2008. , a direct service between Bedford and Milton Keynes is not in any published plan, being overtaken by later events (see next).\n\nMilton Keynes Central has a total of seven platforms. Platforms 1 and 3 are the south and northbound slow platforms, while 4 and 6 are the south and northbound fast platforms. Platforms 2 and 5 are reversible, being slow and fast respectively. Platform 2 is used mainly by terminating services from London Euston or East Croydon, whilst platforms 1 and 3 are used by West Midlands Trains services between Euston and Northampton, Birmingham New Street or Crewe. Platforms 4, 5 and 6 are used by Avanti West Coast inter-city express services between London and the West Midlands, north Wales, the north-west or Scotland. \n\nPlatform 2A is a five-car south-facing bay platform originally intended for the extension of Marston Vale Line services from into Milton Keynes Central: this proposal no longer appears in plans for East West Rail, being replaced by a planned service to/from or (see below). Meanwhile, platform 2A is used only by exception when additional platform capacity is needed, such as when there is a service delay. To the north of the station the six lines reduce to four (two slow and two fast) and there is a mile of five-track running to the south before this also reduces back to four. \n\nThe station is generally accessible: there are no unavoidable steps and there are lifts from the concourse to each platform. As with all mainline railway stations, passengers with mobility limitations may need to pre-book assistance to get from the platform to the train. Ticket gates are in operation.\n\nThe station building has a shop and café. There are other shops and restaurants on the south side of the station square. There are a number of hotels on Midsummer Boulevard (which begins opposite the station and leads up into the central business district). \n\nThe station forecourt is the terminus or key intermediate destination for many bus services; almost all local and district bus services stop there. These services are operated mostly by Arriva Shires & Essex as well as some routes by Stagecoach East and a number of independent operators. Numerous bus services each hour traverse Midsummer Boulevard, connecting the station to the shopping centre, the theatre and Xscape. There is a public toilet in this area.\n\nStagecoach East operate four major long-distance coach routes from here. Their route 99 express service runs to Luton Airport via Luton railway station, providing a direct link between the West Coast Main Line and the Midland Main Line. Route X5 route between Oxford and Cambridge stops here, as do their X4 and X7 interurban bus routes to Northampton, Leicester and Peterborough. Arriva Shires & Essex also operate route X60 to Aylesbury, which terminates at the station. However, National Express services run from the Milton Keynes Coachway, about away, served from this station by the 300 bus or the X5.\n\nThe Milton Keynes redway system, a comprehensive network of cycle/pedestrian shared use paths, connects to the station and its cycle parking facilities.\n\nAlso in the station forecourt, there is a taxi rank (to the left) and a pick-up space for private hire cars (to the right), plus limited (very) short term parking. There is a multi-storey car-park to the north of the station. Parking in the surrounding streets is heavily restricted to discourage commuter parking.\n\nThe station square itself is a favourite site for skateboarding and freestyle BMX and as a result the granite facings of the planting surrounds have suffered from the continuous bumping and grinding. This has lessened somewhat since the opening of a dedicated skateboarding park (Sk8 MK) close to the former central bus station.\n\nMilton Keynes Central is a principal start and terminus for West Midlands Trains plc's 'London Northwestern Railway' services to/from London Euston, and a major stop on others terminating/initiating at , or . During off-peak daytime hours, WMT/NWR operate five departures per hour to Euston, two trains per hour to Birmingham New Street (via Northampton), one train per hour to Crewe, and one train per hour that terminates at Northampton. There are additional WMT/NWR services during the rush hour.\n\nAvanti West Coast stops many of its inter-city services here, with three calls an hour in each direction off-peak on weekdays. Southbound services are to London Euston, northbound services are to Glasgow/Edinburgh via , to and to (with certain trains extending to Bangor and for ferry connections to Dun Laoghaire or to Dublin Port). Additional services operate in the morning peak and evening peaks to and from , , (via Trent Valley Line), and other destinations.\n\nSouthern's West London Route provides an hourly service via the West London Line and Brighton Main Line to (via ), avoiding central London. Onward connections to Gatwick Airport and Brighton are available from Clapham Junction.\n\nFrom 2025, services are planned to operate (over a rebuilt East West Rail line) to via Bletchley, calling at and . This work will reopen Claydon Junction and thus the route to via and . A desire to extend services to and beyond remains unfulfilled because it depends on a new alignment eastwards from Bedford to Cambridge. In January 2020, the East West Rail Ltd. announced the preferred route.\n\nIn June 2018, the Office of Rail & Road approved an application by Alliance Rail Holdings for five services per day between London Euston and , calling at Milton Keynes Central. These services are to be operated by sister Arriva company Grand Central, planned to commence in 'early 2021'.\n\nThe station is at the western end of Central Milton Keynes, near the junction of the A5 with the A509. The nearest post-code is MK9 1BB. In the chainage notation traditionally used on the railway, its location on the line is from Euston.\n\nThe station and its plaza were used in the movie \"\" as a substitute for the United Nations building. Other scenes were shot in the Central Milton Keynes area.\n\n"}

At the 1998 and 2002 parliamentary elections it won parliamentary seats, since then not. When in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) the party was influential, but since the Orange revolution (of late 2004) it has been marginalized.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party of Ukraine () was founded in May 1990. Unlike the originally united SD, the Social Democratic refused to follow democratic socialism and was against federalisation of Ukraine. The party joined the People's Movement of Ukraine which already had some of its members in Verkhovna Rada. During the 1991 presidential elections it supported Viacheslav Chornovil. In May 1992 Yuriy Zbitnyev was elected a head of the party replacing Oleksandr Suhonyako. Suhonyako who wanted the party to follow social liberalism policies left the party with his supporters. In spring of 1993 two parties were merged the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine and the United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (Yuriy Buzduhan) and were registered as a single party SDPU. The head of the new party was Yuriy Buzduhan. Before the next parliamentary elections the new party was to be also merged with the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine, but later both parties ran independently. The party did win two seats in the 1994 parliamentary elections (Yuriy Buzduhan and Hryhoriy Ryhachov). After the 1994 elections the party split into two factions one led by Buzduhan was re-registered as the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine, another led by Yuriy Zbitnyev also wanted to be registered as SDPU, but was denied in registration under such name.\n\nIn 1995 a new merger was registered by Ministry of Justice of Ukraine where the Zbitnyev's faction of former SDPU merged with Party of Human Rights () of Vasyl Onopenko and Ukrainian Party of Justice () of Mykhailo Hrechka to form Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united). The head of the new party was elected Minister of Justice of Ukraine Vasyl Onopenko, while his deputies were Viktor Medvedchuk (former member of the Party of Human Rights), Yuriy Zbitnyev and Mykhailo Hrechka. Note, in 1994 Medvedchuk yet ran for parliament unsuccessfully as non-partisan, according to documents of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine. The documents of the new party were stating that it is a successor of SDPU, Party of Human Rights and Ukrainian Party of Justice, which all of them were dissolved. However, according to Ukrainian historian Vasyl Yablonskyi, bigger portion of SDPU members and majority of Ukrainian Party of Justice never agreed with such decision. The mentioned parties did not only became inactive, but even actively counteracted the newly formed SDPU. The social democrats of Buzduhan accused the leaders of new party in political fraud and representatives of Ukrainian Party of Justice declared that Mykhailo Hrechka exceeded his authority.\n\nOne of the party's creators Viktor Medvedchuk has a very controversial biography due to being a son of a member of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists who managed to attain jurist diploma from a major university in the Soviet Union. He is better known as a state lawyer of several Soviet dissidents from Ukraine who eventually died in prison. In 1989 Medvedchuk was heading the biggest law firm in Kiev with over 40 lawyers, yet not being a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Since 1989 Medvedchuk closely cooperated with football functionary Hryhoriy Surkis who in 1993 was able to become a president of FC Dynamo Kyiv.\n\nThe former President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk later confirmed that former owners of the club petitioned to him to help against the overtake from Surkis-Medvedchuk.\n\nThe Medvedchuk-Surkis group back in 1992 had its own bank, the Ukrainian Credit Bank and business holding \"Omega-XXI vek\". Political and business opponents of the new social democrats were claiming that the business holding was no other than a pyramid scheme which by 1995 owned to the public 28.2 trillion of Karbovanets. Another important business entity of the group was the Industrial and Financial Concern \"Slavutich\" which starting in 1991-92 was receiving credits from foreign banks for purchase of oil which was refining in Ukraine during next 4 to 5 years. In the mid 1990s the office of Slavutich was set on fire and all its accounting records were perished. Through Slavutich, in early 1990s the Medvedchuk-Surkis group managed to established close relationships with the President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. According to Kravchuk, the president of Slavutich was offering anti-crisis economical program and he asked his adviser Valentyn Symonenko to learn more about it. The draft of the program received approval from the acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Yukhym Zvyahilskyi and soon was taken into development by the government of Ukraine. After the 1994 presidential elections there was created a special state commission to review activities of Slavutich, but yielded no results. The newly elected president Leonid Kuchma who was critical of the Medvedchuk-Surkis group, soon after elections was able to find a common ground with it awarding both of them the Order of Merit in 1996.\n\nIn January 1996 the Ministry of Justice annulled the registration of SDPU led by Onopenko and in March 1996 re-registered as SDPU the Buzduhan's faction. In April 1996 the Onopenko's organization conducted its extraordinary party congress where it adopts decision to change its name by adding word \"united\". In 1996 the party was joined by Hryhoriy Surkis and original owners of the Inter television channel Oleksandr Zinchenko with Ihor Pluzhnikov.\n\nIn 1998 the leadership of the party became Viktor Medvedchuk (later the head of Leonid Kuchma's presidential administration), former Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk and Ukrainian tycoon Hryhoriy Surkis. During the presidential term of Leonid Kuchma the party portrayed itself as a centrist, social-democratic moderate political force that advocated integration with Europe and supported the president. The party was closely linked to presidential administration and big business (from Kiev). According to Ukrainian newspaper \"Halytski kontrakty\", in 1998 the Cabinet of Ukraine transferred under administration to the Ukrainian Kredit Bank a share stock package of the Zaporizhia Factory of Ferroalloys as well as number of regional power distributors such as Kirovohradoblenergo, Ternopiloblenergo, and Khersonoblenergo. The leaders of social democrats denied any relations to the energy distribution business, and Medvedchuk particularly called it \"Child babble\" (). However, according to the Siberian newspaper \"Negotsiant\" the representative of energy interests for the social democrats was someone under the name of Konstantin Grigorishin who is a citizen of the Russian Federation and holds place on supervisory boards for several Ukrainian companies among which are Dniprospetsstal, Zaporizhia Factory of Ferroalloys, Sumyoblenergo and many others. According to Ukrainian informational agency \"Prometall\" Grigorishin (along with his partners Levon and Aleksandr Vardanyan) is one of the governors of the investment pool company \"Court Holding\" that owns number of controlling share packages for several oblenergo (power distribution companies). Grigorishin is also the owner of big company \"Sozidanie\" which owns number of strategically important Ukrainian companies among which is the Sumy Engineering Association. In 2016 in Moscow he was accused for not paying taxes from his business.\nAt the 1998 parliamentary elections it won 4,01% (its traditional stronghold was Zakarpattia Oblast); during this election the party ran on a moderate Ukrainian nationalist ideology. Just outside of the top 10 party list there was Petro Poroshenko. At the same time the original social democrats Andriy Nosenko and Yuriy Zbitnyev were placed outside of the top 20 party list. Out of total of 178 names on the party list only first 14 made it to the parliament.\nLeonid Kravchuk Yevhen Marchuk Vasyl Onopenko Viktor Medvedchuk Hryhoriy Surkis<br>Ihor Pluzhnikov Oleksandr Zinchenko Bohdan Hubskyi Serhiy Melnychuk\nSoon after elections in April 1998 the party's leader Onopenko stated that inclusion on the party list Kravchuk and Marchuk as well as reliance on the Dynamo's ranking was a mistake. Following the statement, the party's board denounced the statement of the party's leader and called for a congress to decide the fate of its leader. The October congress excluded its leader from the party. In October 1998 after Medvedchuk became a leader of the party, several prominent former members of the party led by Vasyl Onopenko established the (new party) Ukrainian Social Democratic Party. In February 1999 the party also dismissed another of its member Yevhen Marchuk who wanted with help of the party to run for the President of Ukraine. Marchuk in his turn decided to organize own Social Democratic Union before the upcoming elections.\n\nDuring the 1999 presidential elections the party supported Leonid Kuchma. The party became the first own to nominated the president to run for the second term and played a key role in his successful campaign.\n\nDuring the 2002 parliamentary elections SDPU(o) won 6.27% of the national vote and 24 seats. Final poll results in 2002 had predicted the party to win 9-10% of the total votes. This election the party promoted left-wing Russophile agenda's. It did considerably better in the Donbass and Crimea than 4 years earlier. \nViktor Medvedchuk Tamara Proshkuratova Oleksandr Zinchenko Volodymyr Ryabika Leonid Kravchuk<br>Vasyl Kremen Ivan Rizak Mykhailo Papiev Volodymyr Shepetin Borys Andresyuk\nEarly January 2003 the SDPU(o) faction did consist of 40 seats.\n\nSDPU(o) opposed Viktor Yushchenko's coalition of liberal and nationalist movements and in March 2002 it blamed nationalist elements linked to the pro-Yushchenko \"Our Ukraine\" alliance for the murder of the vice-governor of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, who was an SDPU(o) member.\n\nDuring the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election SDPU(o) also took a strongly pro-Russian and anti-Western stand and backed the candidacy of Viktor Yanukovych. In the aftermath of Viktor Yushchenko's \"Orange Revolution\", SDPU(o) declared itself to be in opposition to the new government. Analysts say that TV channels and other media controlled by the party (Inter, 1+1, TET) have started a sharp anti-U.S./anti-NATO campaign in response to Yuschenko's pro-Western policies. Around the Orange Revolution (late 2004) more ten 10 deputies left the SDPU(o) faction in the Ukrainian parliament; late-January 2005 the faction included 27 deputies in the 450-seat parliament.\n\nIn 2001 Ukrainian historian and politician Dmytro Chobit published a book \"Nartsiss\" (Narcissus) about Viktor Medvedchuk where he claimed that Medvedchuk is connected with Russian special services. That claim was later confirmed by another historian Yuri Felshtinsky.\n\nIvan Rizak, the head of the Trans-Carpathian SDPUo branch and governor of the Trans-Carpathian Oblast, was arrested in May 2005 and charged with abuse of public office and driving a pro-opposition university rector to suicide last year. That same month, the party was accused of involvement in the 2000 murder of Georgiy R. Gongadze, with the journal \"Ukrayina moloda\" (April 14, 2005) accusing party members of using the dead journalist's corpse in a plot to discredit President Leonid Kuchma and force early elections, which could have led to party leader Medvedchuk succeeding Kuchma.\n\nSDPU(o) claims this to be a part of the political campaign of persecution from the new authorities. Supporters of the \"Orange Revolution\" on the other hand claim that the party enjoyed privileged status under the old regime and was closely associated with big business, organized crime, corruption, and media bias in favour of Leonid Kuchma, then President of Ukraine.\n\nDespite being one of the most active political parties with a wide range of political activities and a significant number of student and youth members, SDPU tend to lose a significant number of votes due to the notoriety of its leaders for their business and political practices.\n\nBefore the 2006 parliamentary elections, some commentators regarded SDPU(u) as one of three hard-line anti-Yuschenko forces (the others being the Party of Regions and the Communist Party). Those days the party made approachments towards the Socialist Party of Ukraine. At the legislative elections of 26 March 2006, the party was part of the Opposition Bloc \"Ne Tak\" and failed to clear the 3% minimum to get into parliament. It has thus disappeared from the national political stage. Currently the party is working on draft concepts who will determine its future. The current leader is Yury Zahorodny.\n\nThe party did not participate in the 2007 parliamentary elections.\n\nThe party participated in the 2010 presidential election as part of the Election bloc of left and central left political forces. This decision made ex-President of Ukraine Kravchuk leave the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united), Kravchuk declared he also was indignant due to the fact that the political council of the party decided to accomplish that behind the closed doors in non-democratic order. He called the \"block as the artificial union without any perspectives\".\n\nThe party did not take part in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election nationwide proportional party-list system; instead one members of the party tried to win a seat in one of the 225 local single-member districts; in this district situated in Brovary the candidate got 340 votes (the winner 31.678 votes) and thus failed to win a seat in parliament. The party failed again to win a seat in the 7 July 2013 by-election in constituency 224 in Sevastopol.\n\nThe party did not participate in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election.\n\nThe party received 1 million barrels worth of oil vouchers in the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme.\n\n\n\n"}

Now owned by Autodesk and formerly titled Softimage|XSI, the software has been predominantly used in the film, video game, and advertising industries for creating computer generated characters, objects, and environments.\n\nReleased in 2000 as the successor to Softimage3D, Softimage|XSI was developed by its eponymous company, then a subsidiary of Avid Technology. On October 23, 2008, Autodesk acquired the Softimage brand and 3D animation assets from Avid for approximately $35 million, thereby ending Softimage Co. as a distinct entity. In February 2009, Softimage|XSI was rebranded Autodesk Softimage.\n\nA free version of the software, called \"Softimage Mod Tool\", was developed for the game modding community to create games using the Microsoft XNA toolset for PC and Xbox 360, or to create mods for games using Valve's Source engine, Epic Games's Unreal Engine and others. It was discontinued with the release of Softimage 2014.\n\nOn March 4, 2014, it was announced that Autodesk Softimage would be discontinued after the release of the 2015 version, providing product support until April 30, 2016.\n\nAutodesk Softimage is a 3D animation application comprising a suite of computer graphics tools.\n\nModeling tools allow the generation of polygonal or NURBS models. Subdivision modeling requires no additional operators and works directly on the polygonal geometry. Each modeling operation is tracked by a construction history stack, which enables artists to work non-destructively. Operators in history stacks can be re-ordered, removed or changed at any time, and all adjustments propagate to the final model.\n\nControl rigs are created using bones with automatic IK, constraints and specialized solvers like spine or tail. Optionally, the ICE system can be used to create light-weight rigs in a node-based environment. The rigging process can be sped up through the use of adaptable biped and quadruped rigs, FaceRobot for facial rigs and automatic lip syncing.\n\nAnimation features include layers and a mixer, which allows combining animation clips non-linearly. Animation operators are tracked in a construction history stack that is separate from the modeling stack, enabling users to change the underlying geometry of already animated characters and objects. MOTOR is a feature that transfers animation between characters, regardless of their size or proportions. GATOR can transfer attributes such as textures, UVs, weight maps or envelopes between different models. Softimage also contains tools to simulate particles, particle strands, rigid body dynamics, soft body dynamics, cloth, hair and fluids.\n\nThe default and tightly integrated rendering engine in Softimage is mental ray. Materials and shaders are built in a node-based fashion. When users activate a so-called render region in a camera view, it will render this section of the scene using the specified rendering engine and update completely interactively. A secondary rendering mode is available for rendering real-time GPU shaders written in either the Cg or HLSL languages.\n\nAlso included is the FX Tree, which is a built-in node-based compositor that has direct access to image clips used in the scene. It can thus not only be used to finalize and composite rendered frames, but also as an integral part of scene creation. The FX Tree can be used to apply compositing effects to image clips being used in the fully rendered scene, allowing Softimage to render scenes using textures authored or modified in various ways within the same scene.\n\nIn addition to the node-based ICE platform described below, Softimage has an extensive API and scripting environment that can be used to extend the software. The available scripting languages include C#, Python, VBScript and JScript. A C++ SDK is also available for plug-in developers, with online documentation available to the public.\n\nOn July 7, 2008 the Softimage, Co. announced Softimage|XSI 7, which introduced the ICE (Interactive Creative Environment) architecture. ICE is a visual programming platform that allows users to extend the capabilities of Softimage quickly and intuitively using a node-based dataflow diagram. This enables artists to create complex 3D effects and tools without scripting. Among the main uses for ICE are procedural modeling, deformation, rigging and particle simulation. It can also be used to control scene attributes without the need to write expressions, for example to add camera wiggle or make a light pulsate. ICE is a parallel processing engine that takes advantage of multi-core CPUs, giving users highly scalable performance.\n\nICE represents Softimage functionality using a collection of nodes, each with its own specific capabilities. Users can connect nodes together, visually representing the data flow, to create powerful tools and effects. Softimage ships with several hundred nodes; among them are both low level nodes, such as \"Multiply\" or \"Boolean\", as well as a number of high level nodes called compounds. Compounds serve as \"wrapper nodes\" to collapse ICE graphs into a single node. Softimage allows users to add custom compounds to its main menu system for easy reusability.\n\nThe screenshot on the right shows an example of a simple geometry deformation ICE graph. In a practical scenario, one would collapse the graph into a compound and expose important parameters, for instance the deformation intensity. After adding the tool to the user interface it can easily be applied to other objects. Compounds can also be shared between installations because their entire functionality is stored in XML files.\n\nThe graph-based approach of ICE allows for the creation of effects previously attainable only through the use of scripting and/or compiled code. Due to its visual nature and interactivity, it is very accessible for users with no programming experience. Many free and commercial ICE tools have been made available by users and 3rd party developers. Softimage contains an ICE-based fluid and physics simulator called Lagoa as well as an ICE-based version of the Syflex cloth simulator.\n\nSoftimage is primarily used in the film, video game and advertising industries as a tool to generate digital characters, environments and visual effects. Examples of films made with the help of Softimage are \"Jurassic Park,\" \"Thor,\" \"Predators,\" \"District 9,\" \"White House Down\" and \"Elysium.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1931055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931055", "title": "Gravitational microlensing", "text": "Gravitational microlensing\n\nGravitational microlensing is an astronomical phenomenon due to the gravitational lens effect. It can be used to detect objects that range from the mass of a planet to the mass of a star, regardless of the light they emit. Typically, astronomers can only detect bright objects that emit much light (stars) or large objects that block background light (clouds of gas and dust). These objects make up only a minor portion of the mass of a galaxy. Microlensing allows the study of objects that emit little or no light.\n\nWhen a distant star or quasar gets sufficiently aligned with a massive compact foreground object, the bending of light due to its gravitational field, as discussed by Albert Einstein in 1915, leads to two distorted unresolved images resulting in an observable magnification. The time-scale of the transient brightening depends on the mass of the foreground object as well as on the relative proper motion between the background 'source' and the foreground 'lens' object.\n\nIdeally aligned microlensing produces a clear buffer between the radiation from the lens and source objects, as well as magnification, so will reveal or in size and/or brightness enhance distant sources. It enables the study of the population of faint or dark objects such as brown dwarfs, red dwarfs, planets, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, and\nmassive compact halo objects. The lensing works upon all wavelengths, magnifying (in brightness and with a wide range of possible warping) distant source objects that emit any kind of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nMicrolensing by an isolated object was first detected in 1989. Since then, microlensing has been used to constrain the nature of the dark matter, detect exoplanets, study limb darkening in distant stars, constrain the binary star population, and constrain the structure of the Milky Way's disk. Microlensing has also been proposed as a means to find dark objects like brown dwarfs and black holes, study starspots, measure stellar rotation, and probe quasars including their accretion disks. Microlensing was used in 2018 to detect Icarus, the most distant star ever observed.\n\nMicrolensing is based on the gravitational lens effect. A massive object (the lens) will bend the light of a bright background object (the source). This can generate multiple distorted, magnified, and brightened images of the background source.\n\nMicrolensing is caused by the same physical effect as strong lensing and weak lensing, but it is studied using very different observational techniques. In strong and weak lensing, the mass of the lens is large enough (mass of a galaxy or a galaxy cluster) that the displacement of light by the lens can be resolved with a high resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope. With microlensing, the lens mass is too low (mass of a planet or a star) for the displacement of light to be observed easily, but the apparent brightening of the source may still be detected. In such a situation, the lens will pass by the source in a reasonable amount of time, seconds to years instead of millions of years. As the alignment changes, the source's apparent brightness changes, and this can be monitored to detect and study the event. Thus, unlike with strong and weak gravitational lenses, a microlensing event is a transient phenomenon from a human timescale perspective.\n\nUnlike with strong and weak lensing, no single observation can establish that microlensing is occurring. Instead, the rise and fall of the source brightness must be monitored over time using photometry. This function of brightness versus time is known as a light curve. A typical microlensing light curve is shown below:\nA typical microlensing event like this one has a very simple shape, and only one physical parameter can be extracted: the time scale, which is related to the lens mass, distance, and velocity. There are several effects, however, that contribute to the shape of more atypical lensing events:\n\n\nMost focus is currently on the more unusual microlensing events, especially those that might lead to the discovery of extrasolar planets. Another way to get more information from microlensing events involves measuring the astrometric shifts in the source position during the course of the event and even resolving the separate images with interferometry. The first successful resolution of microlensing images was achieved with the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI).\n\nIn practice, because the alignment needed is so precise and difficult to predict, microlensing is very rare. Events, therefore, are generally found with surveys, which photometrically monitor tens of millions of potential source stars, every few days for several years. Dense background fields suitable for such surveys are nearby galaxies, such as the Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda galaxy, and the Milky Way bulge. In each case, the lens population studied comprises the objects between Earth and the source field: for the bulge, the lens population is the Milky Way disk stars, and for external galaxies, the lens population is the Milky Way halo, as well as objects in the other galaxy itself. The density, mass, and location of the objects in these lens populations determines the frequency of microlensing along that line of sight, which is characterized by a value known as the optical depth due to microlensing. (This is not to be confused with the more common meaning of optical depth, although it shares some properties.) The optical depth is, roughly speaking, the average fraction of source stars undergoing microlensing at a given time, or equivalently the probability that a given source star is undergoing lensing at a given time. The MACHO project found the optical depth toward the LMC to be 1.2×10, and the optical depth toward the bulge to be 2.43×10 or about 1 in 400,000.\n\nComplicating the search is the fact that for every star undergoing microlensing, there are thousands of stars changing in brightness for other reasons (about 2% of the stars in a typical source field are naturally variable stars) and other transient events (such as novae and supernovae), and these must be weeded out to find true microlensing events. After a microlensing event in progress has been identified, the monitoring program that detects it often alerts the community to its discovery, so that other specialized programs may follow the event more intensively, hoping to find interesting deviations from the typical light curve. This is because these deviations – particularly ones due to exoplanets – require hourly monitoring to be identified, which the survey programs are unable to provide while still searching for new events. The question of how to prioritize events in progress for detailed followup with limited observing resources is very important for microlensing researchers today.\n\nIn 1704 Isaac Newton suggested that a light ray could be deflected by gravity. In 1801, Johann Georg von Soldner calculated the amount of deflection of a light ray from a star under Newtonian gravity. In 1915 Albert Einstein correctly predicted the amount of deflection under General Relativity, which was twice the amount predicted by von Soldner. Einstein's prediction was validated by a 1919 expedition led by Arthur Eddington, which was a great early success for General Relativity. In 1924 Orest Chwolson found that lensing could produce multiple images of the star. A correct prediction of the concomitant brightening of the source, the basis for microlensing, was published in 1936 by Einstein. Because of the unlikely alignment required, he concluded that \"there is no great chance of observing this phenomenon\". Gravitational lensing's modern theoretical framework was established with works by Yu Klimov (1963), Sidney Liebes (1964), and Sjur Refsdal (1964).\n\nGravitational lensing was first observed in 1979, in the form of a quasar lensed by a foreground galaxy. That same year Kyongae Chang and Sjur Refsdal showed that individual stars in the lens galaxy could act as smaller lenses within the main lens, causing the source quasar's images to fluctuate on a timescale of months, also known as Chang–Refsdal lens. Bohdan Paczyński first used the term \"microlensing\" to describe this phenomenon. This type of microlensing is difficult to identify because of the intrinsic variability of quasars, but in 1989 Mike Irwin et al. published detection of microlensing in Huchra's Lens.\n\nIn 1986, Paczyński proposed using microlensing to look for dark matter in the form of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) in the Galactic halo, by observing background stars in a nearby galaxy. Two groups of particle physicists working on dark matter heard his talks and joined with astronomers to form the Anglo-Australian MACHO collaboration and the French EROS collaboration.\n\nIn 1986, Robert J. Nemiroff predicted the likelihood of microlensing and calculated basic microlensing induced light curves for several possible lens-source configurations in his 1987 thesis.\n\nIn 1991 Mao and Paczyński suggested that microlensing might be used to find binary companions to stars, and in 1992 Gould and Loeb demonstrated that microlensing can be used to detect exoplanets. In 1992, Paczyński founded the OGLE microlensing experiment, which began searching for events in the direction of the Galactic bulge.\n\nThe first two microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud that might be caused by dark matter were reported in back to back Nature papers by MACHO and EROS in 1993, and in the following years, events continued to be detected. The MACHO collaboration ended in 1999. Their data refuted the hypothesis that 100% of the dark halo comprises MACHOs, but they found a significant unexplained excess of roughly 20% of the halo mass, which might be due to MACHOs or to lenses within the Large Magellanic Cloud itself. \nEROS subsequently published even stronger upper limits on MACHOs, and it is currently uncertain as to whether there is any halo microlensing excess that could be due to dark matter at all. The SuperMACHO project currently underway seeks to locate the lenses responsible for MACHO's results.\n\nDespite not solving the dark matter problem, microlensing has been shown to be a useful tool for many applications. Hundreds of microlensing events are detected per year toward the Galactic bulge, where the microlensing optical depth (due to stars in the Galactic disk) is about 20 times greater than through the Galactic halo. In 2007, the OGLE project identified 611 event candidates, and the MOA project (a Japan-New Zealand collaboration) identified 488 (although not all candidates turn out to be microlensing events, and there is a significant overlap between the two projects). In addition to these surveys, follow-up projects are underway to study in detail potentially interesting events in progress, primarily with the aim of detecting extrasolar planets. These include MiNDSTEp, RoboNet, MicroFUN and PLANET.\n\nThe mathematics of microlensing, along with modern notation, are described by Gould and we use his notation in this section, though other authors have used other notation. The Einstein radius, also called the Einstein angle, is the angular radius of the Einstein ring in the event of perfect alignment. It depends on the lens mass M, the distance of the lens d, and the distance of the source d:\n\nFor M equal to 60 Jupiter masses, d = 4000 parsecs, and d = 8000 parsecs (typical for a Bulge microlensing event), the Einstein radius is 0.00024 arcseconds (angle subtended by 1 au at 4000 parsecs). By comparison, ideal Earth-based observations have angular resolution around 0.4 arcseconds, 1660 times greater. Since formula_2 is so small, it is not generally observed for a typical microlensing event, but it can be observed in some extreme events as described below.\n\nAlthough there is no clear beginning or end of a microlensing event, by convention the event is said to last while the angular separation between the source and lens is less than formula_2. Thus the event duration is determined by the time it takes the apparent motion of the lens in the sky to cover an angular distance formula_2. The Einstein radius is also the same order of magnitude as the angular separation between the two lensed images, and the astrometric shift of the image positions throughout the course of the microlensing event.\n\nDuring a microlensing event, the brightness of the source is amplified by an amplification factor A. This factor depends only on the closeness of the alignment between observer, lens, and source. The unitless number u is defined as the angular separation of the lens and the source, divided by formula_2. The amplification factor is given in terms of this value:\nThis function has several important properties. A(u) is always greater than 1, so microlensing can only increase the brightness of the source star, not decrease it. A(u) always decreases as u increases, so the closer the alignment, the brighter the source becomes. As u approaches infinity, A(u) approaches 1, so that at wide separations, microlensing has no effect. Finally, as u approaches 0, for a point source A(u) approaches infinity as the images approach an Einstein ring. For perfect alignment (u = 0), A(u) is theoretically infinite. In practice, real-world objects are not point sources, and finite source size effects will set a limit to how large an amplification can occur for very close alignment, but some microlensing events can cause a brightening by a factor of hundreds.\n\nUnlike gravitational macrolensing where the lens is a galaxy or cluster of galaxies, in microlensing u changes significantly in a short period of time. The relevant time scale is called the Einstein time formula_7, and it's given by the time it takes the lens to traverse an angular distance formula_2 relative to the source in the sky. For typical microlensing events, formula_7 is on the order of a few days to a few months. The function u(t) is simply determined by the Pythagorean theorem:\nThe minimum value of u, called u, determines the peak brightness of the event.\n\nIn a typical microlensing event, the light curve is well fit by assuming that the source is a point, the lens is a single point mass, and the lens is moving in a straight line: the \"point source-point lens\" approximation. In these events, the only physically significant parameter that can be measured is the Einstein timescale formula_7. Since this observable is a degenerate function of the lens mass, distance, and velocity, we cannot determine these physical parameters from a single event.\n\nHowever, in some extreme events, formula_2 may be measurable while other extreme events can probe an additional parameter: the size of the Einstein ring in the plane of the observer, known as the \"Projected Einstein radius\": formula_13. This parameter describes how the event will appear to be different from two observers at different locations, such as a satellite observer. The projected Einstein radius is related to the physical parameters of the lens and source by\nIt is mathematically convenient to use the inverses of some of these quantities. These are the Einstein proper motion\nand the Einstein parallax\nThese vector quantities point in the direction of the relative motion of the lens with respect to the source. Some extreme microlensing events can only constrain one component of these vector quantities. Should these additional parameters be fully measured, the physical parameters of the lens can be solved yielding the lens mass, parallax, and proper motion as\n\nIn a typical microlensing event, the light curve is well fit by assuming that the source is a point, the lens is a single point mass, and the lens is moving in a straight line: the \"point source-point lens\" approximation. In these events, the only physically significant parameter that can be measured is the Einstein timescale formula_7. However, in some cases, events can be analyzed to yield the additional parameters of the Einstein angle and parallax: formula_2 and formula_22. These include very high magnification events, binary lenses, parallax, and xallarap events, and events where the lens is visible.\n\nAlthough the Einstein angle is too small to be directly visible from a ground-based telescope, several techniques have been proposed to observe it.\n\nIf the lens passes directly in front of the source star, then the finite size of the source star becomes an important parameter. The source star must be treated as a disk on the sky, not a point, breaking the point-source approximation, and causing a deviation from the traditional microlensing curve that lasts as long as the time for the lens to cross the source, known as a \"finite source light curve\". The length of this deviation can be used to determine the time needed for the lens to cross the disk of the source star formula_23. If the angular size of the source formula_24 is known, the Einstein angle can be determined as\nThese measurements are rare, since they require an extreme alignment between source and lens. They are more likely when formula_26 is (relatively) large, i.e., for nearby giant sources with slow-moving low-mass lenses close to the source.\n\nIn finite source events, different parts of the source star are magnified at different rates at different times during the event. These events can thus be used to study the limb-darkening of the source star.\n\nIf the lens is a binary star with separation of roughly the Einstein radius, the magnification pattern is more complex than in the single star lenses. In this case, there are typically three images when the lens is distant from the source, but there is a range of alignments where two additional images are created. These alignments are known as \"caustics\". At these alignments, the magnification of the source is formally infinite under the point-source approximation.\n\nCaustic crossings in binary lenses can happen with a wider range of lens geometries than in a single lens. Like a single lens source caustic, it takes a finite time for the source to cross the caustic. If this caustic-crossing time formula_23 can be measured, and if the angular radius of the source is known, then again the Einstein angle can be determined.\n\nAs in the single lens case when the source magnification is formally infinite, caustic crossing binary lenses will magnify different portions of the source star at different times. They can thus probe the structure of the source and its limb darkening.\n\nAn animation of a binary lens event can be found at this YouTube video.\n\nIn principle, the Einstein parallax can be measured by having two observers simultaneously observe the event from different locations, e.g., from the earth and from a distant spacecraft. The difference in amplification observed by the two observers yields the component of formula_28 perpendicular to the motion of the lens while the difference in the time of peak amplification yields the component parallel to the motion of the lens. This direct measurement was recently reported using the Spitzer Space Telescope. In extreme cases, the differences may even be measurable from small differences seen from telescopes at different locations on the earth.\n\nMore typically, the Einstein parallax is measured from the non-linear motion of the observer caused by the rotation of the earth about the sun. It was first reported in 1995 and has been reported in a handful of events since. Parallax in point-lens events can best be measured in long-timescale events with a large formula_22—from slow-moving, low mass lenses which are close to the observer.\n\nIf the source star is a binary star, then it too will have a non-linear motion which can also cause slight, but detectable changes in the light curve. This effect is known as Xallarap (parallax spelled backwards).\n\nIf the lensing object is a star with a planet orbiting it, this is an extreme example of a binary lens event. If the source crosses a caustic, the deviations from a standard event can be large even for low mass planets. These deviations allow us to infer the existence and determine the mass and separation of the planet around the lens. Deviations typically last a few hours or a few days. Because the signal is strongest when the event itself is strongest, high-magnification events are the most promising candidates for detailed study. Typically, a survey team notifies the community when they discover a high-magnification event in progress. Follow-up groups then intensively monitor the ongoing event, hoping to get good coverage of the deviation if it occurs. When the event is over, the light curve is compared to theoretical models to find the physical parameters of the system. The parameters that can be determined directly from this comparison are the mass ratio of the planet to the star, and the ratio of the star-planet angular separation to the Einstein angle. From these ratios, along with assumptions about the lens star, the mass of the planet and its orbital distance can be estimated.\nThe first success of this technique was made in 2003 by both OGLE and MOA of the microlensing event OGLE 2003–BLG–235 (or MOA 2003–BLG–53). Combining their data, they found the most likely planet mass to be 1.5 times the mass of Jupiter. As of April 2020, 89 exoplanets have been detected by this method. Notable examples include OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb, OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, OGLE-2005-BLG-169Lb, two exoplanets around OGLE-2006-BLG-109L, and MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb. Notably, at the time of its announcement in January 2006, the planet OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb probably had the lowest mass of any known exoplanet orbiting a regular star, with a median at 5.5 times the mass of the Earth and roughly a factor two uncertainty. This record was contested in 2007 by Gliese 581 c with a minimal mass of 5 Earth masses, and since 2009 Gliese 581 e is the lightest known \"regular\" exoplanet, with minimum 1.9 Earth masses. In October 2017, OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb, an extremely massive exoplanet (or possibly a brown dwarf), about 13.4 times the mass of Jupiter, was reported.\n\nComparing this method of detecting extrasolar planets with other techniques such as the transit method, one advantage is that the intensity of the planetary deviation does not depend on the planet mass as strongly as effects in other techniques do. This makes microlensing well suited to finding low-mass planets. It also allows detection of planets further away from the host star than most of the other methods. One disadvantage is that followup of the lens system is very difficult after the event has ended, because it takes a long time for the lens and the source to be sufficiently separated to resolve them separately.\n\nThere are two basic types of microlensing experiments. \"Search\" groups use large-field images to find new microlensing events. \"Follow-up\" groups often coordinate telescopes around the world to provide intensive coverage of select events. The initial experiments all had somewhat risqué names until the formation of the PLANET group. There are current proposals to build new specialized microlensing satellites, or to use other satellites to study microlensing.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is also credited, along with his son Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, with pioneering the propagation of Gaudiya Vaishnavism in the West and its eventual global spread.\n\nKedarnath Datta was born on 2 September 1838 in the town of Birnagar, Bengal Presidency, in a traditional Hindu family of wealthy Bengali landlords. After a village schooling, he continued his education at Hindu College in Calcutta, where he acquainted himself with contemporary Western philosophy and theology. There he became a close associate of prominent literary and intellectual figures of the Bengal Renaissance, such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, and Sisir Kumar Ghosh. At 18, he began a teaching career in rural areas of Bengal and Orissa until he became an employee with the British Raj in the Judicial Service, from which he retired in 1894 as District Magistrate.\n\nKedarnath Datta belonged to the \"kayastha\" community of Bengali intellectual gentry that lived during the Bengal Renaissance and attempted to rationalise their traditional Hindu beliefs and customs. In his youth he spent much time researching and comparing various religious and philosophical systems, both Indian and Western, with a view of finding among them a comprehensive, authentic and intellectually satisfying path. He tackled the task of reconciling Western reason and traditional belief by dividing religion into the phenomenal and the transcendent, thus accommodating both modern critical analysis and Hindu mysticism in his writings. Kedarnath's spiritual quest finally led him at the age of 29 to become a follower of Caitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1533). He dedicated himself to a deep study and committed practice of Caitanya's teachings, soon emerging as a reputed leader within the Caitanya Vaishnava movement in Bengal. He edited and published over 100 books on Vaishnavism, including major theological treatises such as \"Krishna-samhita\" (1880), \"Caitanya-sikshamrita\" (1886) \"Jaiva-dharma\" (1893), \"Tattva-sutra\" (1893), \"Tattva-viveka\" (1893), and \"Hari-nama-cintamani\" (1900). Between 1881 and 1909, Kedarnath also published a monthly journal in Bengali entitled \"Sajjana-toshani\" (\"The source of pleasure for devotees\"), which he used as the prime means for propagating Caitanya's teachings among the \"bhadralok\". In 1886, in recognition of his prolific theological, philosophical and literary contributions, the local Gaudiya Vaishnava community conferred upon Kedarnath Datta the honorific title of \"Bhaktivinoda\".\n\nIn his later years Bhaktivinoda founded and conducted \"nama-hatta\" – a travelling preaching program that spread theology and practice of Caitanya throughout rural and urban Bengal, by means of discourses, printed materials and Bengali songs of his own composition. He also opposed what he saw as \"apasampradayas\", or numerous distortions of the original Caitanya teachings. He is credited with the rediscovery of the lost site of Caitanya's birth, in Mayapur near Nabadwip, which he commemorated with a prominent temple.\n\nBhaktivinoda Thakur pioneered the spread of Caitanya's teachings in the West, sending in 1880 copies of his works to Ralph Waldo Emerson in the United States and to Reinhold Rost in Europe. In 1896 another publication of Bhaktivinoda, a book in English entitled \"Srimad-Gaurangalila-Smaranamangala, or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, His life and Precepts\" was sent to several academics and libraries in Canada, Britain and Australia.\n\nThe revival of Gaudiya Vaishnavism effected by Bhaktivinoda spawned one of India's most dynamic preaching missions of the early 20th century, the Gaudiya Matha, headed by his son and spiritual heir, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. Bhaktisiddhanta's disciple A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami (1896–1977) continued his \"guru\" Western mission when in 1966 in the United States he founded ISKCON, or the Hare Krishna movement, which then spread Gaudiya Vaishnavism globally.\n\nBhaktivinoda wrote an autobiographical account titled \"Svalikhita-jivani\" that spanned the period from his birth in 1838 until retirement in 1894. He died in Calcutta on 23 June 1914 at age 75. His remains were interred near Mayapur, West Bengal.\n\nKedarnath's birth in 1838 occurred during the period of the history of Bengal marked by the emergence and rising influence of the \"bhadralok\" community. The \"bhadralok\", literally \"gentle or respectable people\", was a newly born privileged class of Bengalis, largely Hindus, who served the British administration in occupations requiring Western education, and proficiency in English and other languages. Exposed to and influenced by the Western values of the British, including the latter's often condescending attitude towards cultural and religious traditions of India, the \"bhadralok\" themselves started calling into question and reassessing the tenets of their own religion and customs. Their attempts to rationalise and modernise Hinduism in order to reconcile it with the Western outlook eventually gave rise to a historical period called the Bengali Renaissance, championed by such prominent reformists as Rammohan Roy and Swami Vivekananda. This trend gradually led to a widespread perception, both in India and in the West, of modern Hinduism as being equivalent to Advaita Vedanta, a conception of the divine as devoid of form and individuality that was hailed by its proponents as the \"perennial philosophy\" and \"the mother of religions\". As a result, the other schools of Hinduism, including \"bhakti\", were gradually relegated in the minds of the Bengali Hindu middle-class to obscurity, and often seen as a \"reactionary and fossilized jumble of empty rituals and idolatrous practices.\"\n\nKedarnath was born on 2 September 1838 in the village of Ula (presently Birnagar) in Bengal, some north of modern-day Kolkata. Both his father Ananda Chandra Dutta and mother Jagat Mohini Devi hailed from affluent \"kayastha\" families.\n\nFrom the time of Caitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1533), the paternal Datta lineage were mostly Vaishnavas and counted among their ranks Krishnananda, an associate of Nityananda Prabhu. Kedarnath's mother Jagan Mohini Devi (born Mitra) was a descendant of Rameshwar Mitra, a prominent \"zamindar\" (landowner) of the 18th century. In his autobiography \"Svalikhita-jivani\" Kedaranath refers to his father Anand Chandra Dutta as a \"straightforward, clean, religious man\" and describes his mother as \"a sober woman possessed of many unique qualities\".\n\nKedarnath was the third of six children of Anand Chandra and Jagat Mohini, preceded by older brothers Abhaykali (died before Kedarnath's birth) and Kaliprasanna, and followed by three younger siblings: sister Hemlata and brothers Haridas and Gauridas. Homely as a baby, Kedarnath evoked particular affection of his mother who prayed for his survival.\n\nPrior to his birth, financial circumstances had forced his parents to relocate from Calcutta to Ula, where he was born and grew up in the palace of his maternal grandfather, Ishwar Chandra Mustauphi, a prosperous landowner famed for his generosity.\n\nFrom the age of five, Kedarnath attended the village school in Ula. Later, when an English school opened there, he showed such keen interest in the English language, attending the classes during lunch, that the headmaster of the school convinced Anand Chandra to let the boy study there. At the age of seven Kadarnath was transferred to another English school in Krishnanagar.\n\nIn the following years Kedarnath's family faced a series of calamities. All three of his brothers died of cholera, soon followed by their father Anand Chandra. The financial situation of his widowed mother worsened as his maternal grandfather Ishwar Chandra incurred huge debts due to the oppressive Permanent Settlement Act and ended up bankrupt. In 1850, when Kedarnath was 12, in accordance with the upper-class Hindu customs Jagat Mohini married him to a five-year-old Shaymani Mitra of Ranaghat, hoping to sever Kedarnath's connection with the ill fate of his own family with the good \"karma\" of the in-laws. Soon after the wedding Ishwar Chandra died, leaving the entire responsibility for his troubled estate on the widow with two young children. Kedarnath recalls:\n\nThese hardships made young Kedarnath question the meaning of life and ponder over reasons for human sufferings. He felt unconvinced by conventional explanations and started doubting the reality of the many Hindu gods and goddesses worshiped in village temples. Exposed to contradictory views ranging from religious beliefs to tantric practices, exorcism, superstitions and avid atheism, Kedarnath found himself in a state of disappointment and philosophical confusion. It was at that time that an encounter with a simple old woman who advised him to chant the name of Rama that unexpectedly made a profound impact on him, planting the seed of Vaishnava faith that he maintained throughout his life.\n\nNew challenges and responsibilities caused Kedarnath to visit Calcutta for the first time. The trip, albeit short and unpleasant, further developed his curiosity for European life and customs. Back in Ula he continued struggling to maintain the property inherited from his grandfather, which took a toll on his education. Finally, in 1852 his maternal uncle, Kashiprasad Ghosh, a famous poet and newspaper editor, visited Ula and, impressed with the talented boy, convinced Jagat Mohini to send Kedarnath to Calcutta to further his studies. In November 1852, leaving his mother and sister behind in Ula, Kedarnath moved to Ghosh's house on Bidan Street in the middle of Calcutta.\n\nCalcutta was a multicutural city, very different from Kedarnath's experience. A graduate of the prestigious Hindu College of Calcutta, his maternal uncle Kashiprasad Ghosh was a champion of Westernisation, editor of the English language \"Hindu Intelligencer\" journal that propagated the ideas of the \"bhadralok\", and a patriotic poet praised even by the British.\n\nKedarnath stayed with Kashiprasad Ghosh until 1858 and became steeped in the lifestyle of the \"bhadralok\" and immersed in studying a wide range of Western philosophical, poetic, political, and religious text. Kadarnath studied at the Hindu Charitable Institute between 1852 – 1856 and met one of the leading \"bhadralok\" Hindu intellectuals of the time, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820–1891), who became his tutor, mentor, and a lifelong friend.\n\nWhile excelling in his studies, especially in the English language and writing, Kedarnath started writing his own poems and articles. Exposed to and influenced by the views of the famous acquaintances of Kashiprasad who frequented his home: Kristo Das Pal, Shambhu Mukhopadhyay, Baneshwar Vidyalankar and others – Kedarnath started regularly contributing to the \"Hindu Intelligencer\" journal of his uncle, critiquing contemporary social and political issues from a \"bhadralok\" viewpoint. Eventually Kedarnath felt confident enough in his studies and in 1856 enrolled in the Hindu College, Calcutta's leading school, where for the next two years he continued his studies under Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in the company of remarkable classmates such as Keshub Chandra Sen, Nabagopal Mitra, as well as the elder brothers of Rabindranath Tagore: Satyendranath, and Ganendranath. Becoming increasingly involved in the intellectual values of the \"bhadralok\" community, Kedarnath along with his classmates started taking public speaking lessons from a famous British parliamentarian and abolitionist George Thompson (1804–1878). At the same time Kedarnath published his first major literary work, a historical poem titled \"The Poriade\" in two volumes that earned him both a name as a poet and some income.\n\nKedarnath's health deteriorated due to poor drinking water and the challenging environment of Calcutta. He made regular visits to his mother and sister in Ula for recovery and convalescence. However, when in 1856 a violent outbreak of cholera wiped out the whole village of Ula, killing his sister Hemlata and barely sparing his mother, Kedarnath took her along with his grandmother to Calcutta for good. The devastation of Ula marked a turning point in Kedarnath's attitude to life. He writes:\n\nFinding himself disoriented, he sought shelter and solace in his friendship with the Tagore brothers. There he overcame his crisis and started moving towards a religious rather than social and political outlook on life. Along with Dvijendranath Tagore, Kedarnath started studying Sanskrit and theological writings of such authors as Kant, Goethe, Hegel, Swedenborg, Hume, Voltaire, and Schopenhauer, as well as the books of Brahmo Samaj that rekindled his interest in Hinduism. At the same time, Kedarnath daily met with Charles Dall, a Unitarian minister from the American Unitarian Association of Boston posted to Calcutta for propagating Unitarian ideas among the educated Bengalis. Under Dall's guidance, Kedarnath studied the Bible and the Unitarian writings of Channing, Emerson, Parker and others. While developing a fascination for the liberalism of Unitarian religious teachings, the young Kedarnath also studied the Qur'an.\n\nDire financial strain and obligations to maintain his young wife and aging mother caused Kedarnath to look for employment. Finding a well-paid job in Calcutta – especially a job compatible with his high ethical values – was nearly impossible. After a few unsuccessful stints as a teacher and incurring a large debt, Kedarnath along with his mother and wife accepted the invitation of Rajballabh, his paternal grandfather in Orissa, and in the spring of 1858 left for the Orissan village of Chutimangal.\n\nIn Chutimangal, Kedarnath Datta was able to begin his career as an English teacher – first at the local village school, and then, after passing a qualification examination, at a more prestigious school in Cuttack. From 1862-1865,he served as the first headmaster of Bhadrak High School(currently,Zilla School,Bhadrak) in Bhadrak. His financial situation considerably improved, allowing him to dedicate more time to studying, writing and lecturing. This established Kedarnath as a prominent intellectual and cultural voice of the local \"bhadralok\" community, and soon a following of his own formed, consisting of students attracted by his discourses and personal tutorship on religious and philosophical topics.\n\nIn August 1860 his first son, Annada Datta, was born, followed by the death of his young wife ten months later. Widowed and with an infant on his hands at twenty-three, Kedarnath soon married Bhagavati Devi, a daughter of Gangamoy Roy of Jakpore, who would become his lifelong companion and the mother of his other thirteen children. After a short tenure at a lucrative position as the head clerk at the Bardhaman revenue collector's office, Kedarnath felt morally compromised as well as insecure with the position of a rent collector, settling for a less profitable but more agreeable occupation as a clerk elsewhere.\n\nThese external events as well as the internal conflict between morality and need moved Kedarnath towards a deeper introspection in search for a more personal and ethically appealing concept of God as accepted in Christianity and Vaishnavism. Marking this period of his life is Kedarnath's growing interest in Gaudiya Vaishnavism and particularly in the persona and teachings of Caitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1533). Kedarnath tried to acquire a copy of \"Caitanya Caritamrita\" and the \"Bhagavata Purana\", principal scriptures for Gaudiya Vaishnavas, but failed. However, his kindled interest in Caitanya's teaching and example of love for Krishna, the personal form of God, coupled with Caitanya's grace and ethical integrity became the decisive moment in his life and mission.\n\nThis period was also marked with Kedarnath's budding literary gift. Taking advantage of the tranquility of his new clerical job, he composed Bengali poems \"Vijanagrama\" and \"Sannyasi\", lauded for their poetic elegance and novel meter that incorporated the style of Milton and Byron into Bengali verse. He also authored an article on Vaishnavism as well as a book \"Our Wants\".\n\nAs Bhagavati Devi gave birth to Kedarnath's second child, daughter Saudhamani (1864), the need to secure a more stable income for his growing family made Kedarnath seek a job with the British government.\n\nIn February 1866 Kedarnath Datta received, with a friend's help, a position with the Registrar's office as a \"Special Deputy Registrar of Assurances with Powers of a Deputy Magistrate and Deputy Collector\" in Chhapra, Saran district of Bihar. In colonial Bengal, a job at the executive government service, staffed mostly by the \"bhadralok\" (except for the topmost management tier occupied by the British), was the most coveted achievement that ensured one's financial security, social status and protected retirement. During the next twenty-eight years, Kedarnath rose through the ranks of civil service from sixth grade to second grade, which entailed wealth, respect and authority. Kedarnath gradually established himself with the British authorities as a trustworthy, responsible and efficient officer and a man of integrity. The course of his government service took him and his growing family to almost twenty different locations in Bihar, Bengal, and Orissa, which allowed him to study different cultures, languages and religions. He also soon revealed himself as a linguistic savant, within a short time learning Urdu and Persian that were required for his government duties. He also mastered Sanskrit for his Vaishnava pursuits, enough to be able to read the \"Bhagavata Purana\" with traditional commentaries and to write his own Sanskrit poetry.\n\nWhile Kedarnath's health suffered from prolonged bouts of fever and colitis, he took advantage of the paid sick leave to visit Mathura and Vrindavana – sacred places for Gaudiya Vaishnavas.\n\nHis interest in Caitanya Vaishnavism grew. He found a copy of Caitanya's biography \"Caitanya Caritamrita\" by Krishnadasa Kaviraja and a translation of \"Bhagavata Purana\" in 1868 after an eight-year search. He became increasingly appreciative of the philosophical sophistication and ethical purity of Caitanya's teaching but struggled to reconcile it with the prevalent perception of Krishna, Caitanya's worshipable God described in the \"Bhagavata Purana\", as \"basically a wrong-doer\". He came to the conclusion that both faith and reason have their respective, mutually complementary places in religious experience, and neither can be ousted from it altogether. Kedarnath describes the transformation he went through while reading the long sought-after scripture:\n\nAccepting Caitanya as the final goal of his intellectual and spiritual quest, Kedarnath soon started delivering public lectures on his teachings, culminating in his famous speech \"\" – his first public announcement of the newly found religious allegiance. In \"The Bhagavat\", delivered in masterful English but directed at both the Western cultural conquest and the \"bhadralok\" it influenced, Kedarantha attempted to reconcile modern thought and Vaishnava orthodoxy and to restore the \"Bhagavata\" to its preeminent position in Hindu philosophy. His newly found inspiration in the teachings of Caitanya and \"Bhagavata\" made Kedarnath receive his next job transfer to Jagannath Puri as a blessing – Puri was Caitanya's residence for most of his life, and the shelter of the principal Vaishnava shrine, the Temple of Jagannath.\n\nFollowing the annexation of the state of Orissa by Britain in 1803, the British force commander in India, Marquess Wellesley ordered by decree \"the utmost degree of accuracy and vigilance\" in protecting the security of the ancient Jagannath temple and in respecting religious sentiments of its worshipers. The policy was strictly followed, to the point that the British army escorted Hindu religious processions. However, under the pressure of Christian missionaries both in India and in Britain, in 1863 this policy was lifted, entrusting the temple management entirely to the care of the local \"brahmana\"s, which soon led to its deterioration.\n\nWhen Kedarnath was posted to Puri in 1870, he was already known for his honesty and integrity, and was consequently given the charge to oversee law and order in the busy pilgrimage site, as well as providing thousands of pilgrims with food, accommodation, and medical assistance on festival occasions. The government also deputed Kedarnath as a law enforcement officer to thwart the Atibadis, a heterodox Vaishnava sect that conspired to overthrow the British and was led by a self-proclaimed \"avatar\" Bishkishan – task that Kedarnath successfully accomplished.\n\nHowever, while busy with governmental assignments, Kedarnath dedicated his off-duty time to nurturing the newly acquired inspiration with Gaudiya Vaishnavism. He started mastering his Sanskrit under the tutelage of local \"pandits\" and absorbed himself in intense study of \"Caitanya Caritamrita\", \"Bhagavata Purana\" with commentaries by Shridhara Svami, as well as seminal philosophical treatises of the Gaudiya Vaishnava canon such as the \"Sat Sandarbhas\" by Jiva Goswami (c.1513–1598) \"Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu\" by Rupa Goswami (1489–1564) and Baladeva Vidyabhushana's (−1768) \"Govinda Bhashya\" commentary on the \"Brahma Sutras\". Kedarnath also started searching for authentic Gaudiya Vaishnava manuscripts and writing prolifically on the subject of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, authoring and publishing \"Datta-kaustubha\" and a number of Sanskrit verses, and commenced a major literary work of his life, \"Krishna-samhita\".\nSoon Kedarnath formed a society called \"Bhagavat Samsad\" consisting of the local \"bhadralok\", who were eager listen to his intellectually stimulating and insightful exposition of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. This brought him at odds with the local pandit, who criticised him for lecturing on Vaishnava topics while lacking a proper Vaishnava initiation, or \"diksha\", the tilak markings, and other devotional insignia. Even though Kedarnath was already following Gaudiya Vaishnava spiritual discipline like \"harinama-japa\", or chanting the Hare Krishna mantra on beads, their opposition prompted Kedarnath to seriously aspire for finding a \"diksha-guru\" and taking initiation from him.\n\nWhile Kedarnath Datta was able to favourably influence many \"bhadraloks\" hitherto skeptical towards Gaudiya Vaishnavism of Caitanya, he felt in need of assistance. When his wife gave birth to a new child, Kedarnath linked the event to the divinatory dream and named his son Bimala Prasad ('\"the mercy of Bimala Devi\"). The same account mentions that at his birth, the child's umbilical cord was looped around his body like a sacred brahmana thread (\"upavita\") that left a permanent mark on the skin, as if foretelling his future role as religious leader. In the early 1880s, Kedarnath Datta, out of desire to foster the child's budding interest in spirituality, initiated him into \"harinama-japa\". At the age of nine Bimala Prasad memorised the seven hundred verses of the\" Bhagavad Gita\" in Sanskrit. From his early childhood Bimala Prasad demonstrated a sense of strict moral behavior, a sharp intelligence, and an eidetic memory. He gained a reputation for remembering passages from a book on a single reading, and soon learned enough to compose his own poetry in Sanskrit. Bhaktisiddhanta's biographers write that even up to his last days Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati could verbatim recall passages from books that he had read in his childhood, earning the epithet \"living encyclopedia\". Bimala Prasad later became known as Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati.\n\nBy the end Kedarnath's tenure in Puri his family already had seven children, and his oldest daughter, Saudamani, 10, had to be married – which, according to upper-class Hindu customs, had to take place in Bengal. Kedarnath took a three-month privileged leave from his duties and in November 1874 went with his family to Bengal.\n\nAfter leaving Puri for Bengal, Kedarnath Datta decided to establish his growing family at a permanent home in Calcutta, called by him \"Bhakti Bhavan\", which afforded him more freedom in his traveling, studies and writing.\n\nIn 1880 Kedarnath and his wife accepted \"diksha \"(initiation) into Gaudiya Vaishnavism from Bipin Bihari Goswami (1848–1919), a hereditary descendant from one of Caitanya's associates, Vamsivadana Thakur, which formalised his commitment to the Gaudiya Vaishnava \"sampradaya.\" Later he developed a strong spiritual connection with a renowned Gaudiya Vaishnava ascetic Jagannatha Dasa Babaji (1776–1894), who became his principal spiritual mentor.\n\nIn 1885 Kedarnath Datta formed the Vishva Vaishnava Raj Sabha (\"Royal World Vaishnava Association\") composed of leading Bengali Vaishnavas and established at his own house the Vaishnava Depository, a library and a printing press for systematically presenting Gaudiya Vaishnavism by publishing canonical devotional texts, often with his translations and commentaries, as well as his own original writing. In his endeavors to restore the purity and influence of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, in 1881 Bhaktivinoda began a monthly magazine in Bengali, \"Sajjana-toshani\" (\"The source of pleasure for devotees\"), in which he serialised many of his books and published essays of the history and philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, along with book reviews, poetry, and novels. In January 1886, in recognition of Kedarnath's significant role in reviving Vaishnavism through his literary and spiritual achievements, the local Gaudiya Vaishnava leaders including his \"guru \"Bipin Bihari Goswami conferred upon him the honorific title Bhaktivinoda; from that time on he was known as Kedarnath Datta Bhaktivinoda, or Bhakivinoda Thakur.\nOn 4 October 1894, at the age of 56, Bhaktivinoda Thakur retired from government service and moved with his family to Mayapur to focus on his devotional practice, writing and preaching. In 1908 Bhaktivinoda formally adopted the lifestyle and practice of a \"babaji\" (Vaishnava recluse) at his house in Calcutta, absorbed in chanting the Hare Krishna mantra until his death on 23 June 1914. His remains in a silver urn were interred at his house in Surabhi-kunj.\n\nFrom 1874 till his departure in 1914 Bhaktivinoda wrote profusely, both philosophical works in Sanskrit and English that appealed to the \"bhadralok\" intelligentsia, and devotional songs (\"bhajans\") in simple Bengali that conveyed the same message to the masses. His bibliography counts over one hundred works, including his translations of canonical Gaudiya Vaishnava texts, often with his own commentaries, as well as poems, devotional song books, and essays – an achievement his biographers attribute in large part to his industrious and organised nature.\n\n\"Krishna-samhita\" published in 1879 was Bhaktivinoda's first major work. Composed in Sanskrit and Bengali, the book was intended as a response to severe criticism of Krishna by Christian missionaries, Brahmo Samaj, and Westernised \"bhadralok\" for what they saw as his immoral, licentious behavior incompatible with his divine status in Hinduism. The critics drew upon the perceived moral lapses in Krishna's character to further their propaganda against Hinduism and Vaishnavism, challenging their very ethical foundation. In defense of the tenets of Vaishnavism, Bhaktivinoda's \"Krishna-samhita\" employed the same rational tools of its opponents, complete with contemporary archeological and historical data and theological thought, to establish Krishna's pastimes as transcendent (\"aprakrita\") manifestations of morality. In particular, he applied what he termed \"adhunika-vada\" (\"contemporary thinking\") – his methodology of correlating the phenomenal discourse of the scripture with the observable reality. The book evoked an intense and polarised response, with some praising its intellectual novelty and traditionalism while others condemned it for what they saw as deviations from the orthodox Vaishnava hermeneutics. Bhaktivinoda recalls:\n\nUnabated by the criticism, Bhaktivinoda saw \"Krishna-samhita\" as an adequate presentation of the Gaudiya Vaishnava thought even to a Western mind, and in 1880 sent copies of the book to leading intellectuals of Europe and America. Soon Bhaktivinoda received a favorable response from an eminent Sanskrit scholar in London Reinhold Rost, and a courteous acknowledgement of the gift from Ralph Waldo Emerson. This became the first foray of Caitanya's theology into the Western world.\n\nIn 1886 Bhaktivinoda published his another important and, probably, most famous work \"Caitanya-siksamrita\", which summarises the teachings of Caitanya and includes Bhaktivinoda's own socio-religious analysis. Along with it came his own Bengali translation of the \"Bhagavad Gita \"with commentaries by Visvanatha Chakravarti (ca.1626–1708), \"Amnaya-sutra,\" \"Vaishnava-siddhanta-mala, Prema-pradipa, \"his own Sanskrit commentaries on \"Caitanya-upanisad \"and Caitanya Mahaprabhu's \"Siksastakam\" as well as two parts of \"Caitanya-caritamrita\" with his own commentary entitled \"Amrita-pravaha-bhashya\" [\"A commentary that showers nectar\"]\".\"\nIn \"Jaiva-dharma\", another key piece of Thakur's writing, published in 1896, Bhaktivinoda employs the fictional style of a novel to create an ideal, even utopian Vaishnava realm that serves as a backdrop to philosophical and esoteric truths unfolding in a series of conversations between the book's characters and guiding their devotional transformations. \"Jaiva-dharma\" is considered one of the most important books in the Gaudiya Vaishnava lineage of Bhaktivinoda, translated into many languages and printed in thousands of copies.\n\nAt the request of his son, Lalita Prasad, in 1896 Bhaktivinoda wrote a detailed autobiography called \"Svalikhita-jivani\" that covered 56 years of his life from birth up until that time. Written with candour, Bhaktivinoda described a life full of financial struggle, health issues, internal doubts and insecurity, and deep introspection that gradually led him, sometimes in convoluted ways, to the deliberate and mature decision of accepting Caitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings as his final goal. Bhaktivinoda did not display much concern for how this account would reflect on his status as an established Gaudiya Vaishnava spiritual leader. It is telling that he never refers to himself as feeling or displaying any special spiritual acumen, saintlihood, powers, or charisma – anything worthy of veneration. The honest, almost self-deprecating narrative portrays him as a genuine, exceptionally humble and modest man, serving as the best exemplar and foundation of the teaching he dedicated his later life to spreading. The book was published by Lalita Prasad in 1916 after Bhaktivinoda's death.\nBhaktivinoda also contributed significantly to the development of Vaishnava music and song in the 19th century. He composed many devotional songs, or \"bhajans\", mostly in Bengali and occasionally in Sanskrit, that were compiled into collections, such as \"Kalyana-kalpataru\" (1881), \"Saranagati\" (1893) and \"Gitavali\" (1893). Conveying the essence of Gaudiya Vaishnava teachings in simple language, many of his songs are to this day widely popular in Bengal and across the world.\n\nIn 1886 Bhaktivinoda attempted to retire from his government service and move to Vrindavan to pursue his devotional life. However, he saw a dream in which Caitanya ordered him to go to Nabadwip instead. After some difficulty, in 1887 Bhaktivinoda was transferred to Krishnanagar, a district centre away from Nabadwip, famous as the birthplace of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Despite poor health, Bhaktivinoda began to regularly visit Nabadwip to research places connected with Caitanya. Soon he came to a conclusion that the site purported by the local \"brahmanas\" to be Caitanya's birthplace could not possibly be genuine. Determined to find the actual place of Caitanya's past but frustrated by the lack of reliable evidence and clues, one night he saw a mystical vision:\n\nTaking this as a clue, Bhaktivinoda conducted an investigation of the site by consulting old maps matched against scriptural and verbal accounts. He concluded that the village of Ballaldighi was formerly known as Mayapur, confirmed in \"Bhakti-ratnakara\" as the birth site of Caitanya. He soon acquired a property in Surabhi-kunj near Mayapur to oversee the temple construction at Caitanya's birthplace. For this purpose he organised, via \"Sajjana-tosani\" and special festivals, as well as personal acquaintances, a hugely successful fundraising effort. Noted Bengali journalist Sisir Kumar Ghosh (1840–1911) commended Bhaktivinoda for the discovery and hailed him as \"the seventh goswami\" – a reference to the Six Goswamis, renowned medieval Gaudiya Vaishnava ascetics and close associates of Caitanya who had authored many of the school's theological texts and discovered places of Krishna's pastimes in Vrindavan.\n\nKedarnath started a travelling preaching program in Bengali and Orissan villages that he called \"nama-hatta\", or \"the market-place of the name [of Krishna]\". Modelled after the circuit court system, his \"nama-hatta\" groups included \"kirtana\" parties, distribution of \"prasada\" (food offered to Krishna), and lecturers on the teachings of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, travelling from village to village as far as Vrindavan in an organised and systematic way. The program was a big success, widely popularising the teachings of Caitanya among the masses as well as attracting a following of high-class patrons. By the beginning of the 20th century Bhaktivinoda had established over five hundred \"nama-hattas\" across Bengal.\n\nPrior to Bhaktivinoda's literary and preaching endeavours, an organised Gaudiya Vaishnava \"sampradaya\" (lineage) was virtually nonexistent, as was a single, overarching Gaudiya Vaishnava canon in a codified form. In the absence of such theological and organisational commonality, claims of affiliation with Gaudiya Vaishnavism by individuals and groups were either tenuous, superficial, or unverifiable. Bhaktivinoda Thakur attempted to restore the once strong and unified Caitanya's movement from the motley assortment of sects that it came to be towards the end of the 19th century, choosing his \"Sajjjana-tosani\" magazine as the means for this task. Through his articles dealing with the process of initiation and \"sadhana\", through translations of Vaishnava scriptures, and his through commentaries on contemporary issues from a Vaishnava perspective, Bhaktivinoda was gradually establishing, both in the minds of his large audience and in writing, the foundation for Gaudiya Vaishnava orthodoxy and orthopraxy, or what a Vaishnava is and isn't.\n\nGradually Bhaktivinoda directed criticism at various heterodox Vaishnava groups abound in Bengal that he identified and termed \"a-Vaishnava\" (non-Vaishnava) and \"apasampradayas\" (\"deviant lineages\"): Aul, Baul, Saina, Darvesa, Sahajiya, \"smarta brahmanas\", etc. Of them, the Vaishnava spin-off groups that presented sexual promiscuity to be a spiritual practice became the target of choice for Bhaktivinoda's especially pointed attacks. A more tacit but nothing short of uncompromising philosophical assault was directed at the influential \"jati-gosais\" (caste goswamis) and \"smarta brahmanas\" who claimed exclusive right to conduct initiations into Gaudiya Vaishnavism on the basis of their hereditary affiliation with it and denied eligibility to do so to non-\"brahmana\" Vaishnavas. Bhaktivinoda's contention with them was brewing for many years until it came to a head when he, already seriously ill, delegated his son Bhaktisiddhanta to the famous \"Brāhmaṇa o Vaiṣṇava\" (Brahmana and Vaishnava) debate that took place in 1911 in Balighai, Midnapore and turned into Bhaktisiddhanta's and Bhaktivinoda's triumph.\n\nAlthough his \"Krishna-samhita made it into the hands of some leading intellectuals of the West, a book in Sanskrit had very few readers there. \"Despite this obstacle, in 1882 Bhaktivinoda stated in his \"Sajjana-toshani\" magazine a coveted vision of universalism and brotherhood across borders and races:\n\nBhaktivinoda did not stop short of making practical efforts to implement his vision. In 1896 he published and sent to several academic addressees in the West a book entitled that portrayed Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as a champion of \"universal brotherhood and intellectual freedom\":\n\nBhaktivinoda adapted his message to the Western mind by borrowing popular Christian expressions such as \"universal fraternity\", \"cultivation of the spirit\", \"preach\", and \"church\" and deliberately using them in a Hindu context. Copies of \" Chaitanya, His Life and Precepts\" were sent to Western scholars across the British Empire, and landed, among others, in academic libraries at McGill University in Montreal, at the University of Sydney in Australia and at the Royal Asiatic Society of London. The book also made its way to prominent scholars such as Oxford Sanskritist Monier Monier-Williams and earned a favorable review in the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society\".\nBhaktivinoda's son who by that time came to be known as Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati inherited the vision of spreading the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the West from his father. This inspiration was bequeathed to Bhaktisiddhanta in a letter that he received from Bhaktivinoda in 1910:\n\nIn the 1930s, the Gaudiya Math founded by Bhaktisiddhanta sent its missionaries to Europe, but remained largely unsuccessful it is Western outreach efforts, until in 1966 Bhaktisiddhanta's disciple A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami (1896–1977) founded in New York City the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Modeled after the original Gaudiya Math and emulating its emphasis on dynamic mission and spiritual practice, ISKCON popularised Chaitanya Vaishnavism on a global scale, becoming a world's leading proponent of Hindu \"bhakti\" personalism.\n\n\n"}

It has been in service with the Russian Armed Forces since 2007. In 2017, the S-400 was described by \"The Economist\" as \"one of the best air-defence systems currently made\". According to Siemon Wezeman of Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the S-400 \"is among the most advanced air defense systems available.\" \nBecause of its capabilities, several countries, including China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, India, and Qatar, have expressed their appreciation for the S-400 system. China was the first foreign buyer to make a government-to-government deal with Russia in 2014.\n\nThe development of the S-400 system began in the late 1980s, and the system was announced by the Russian Air Force in January 1993. On 12 February 1999, successful tests were reported at Kapustin Yar in Astrakhan, and the S-400 was scheduled for deployment by the Russian army in 2001.\n\nIn 2003, it became apparent that the system was not ready for deployment. In August, two high-ranking military officials expressed concern that the S-400 was being tested with \"obsolete\" interceptors from the S-300P system and concluded that it was not ready for deployment. The completion of the project was announced in February 2004, and in April, a ballistic missile was successfully intercepted in a test of the upgraded 48N6DM missile. In 2007, the system was approved for service. Russia has accepted for service the 40N6 long-range missile for the S-400 air defence system, a source in the domestic defense industry told TASS news agency in October 2018.\n\nThe S-400 Triumph and Pantsir missile system can be integrated into a two-layer defense system.\n\nS-400 missile systems are organized around the 30K6E administration system, which can coordinate eight divizion (battalions).\nThe 55K6E is a command and control center based on the Ural-532301. The 91N6E is a panoramic radar detection system with a 600-kilometre (370 mi) range and protection against jamming, and is mounted on an MZKT-7930. The S-band system can track 300 targets. Six battalions of 98ZH6E surface-to-air missile systems (an independent combat system) can track no more than six targets on their own, with an additional two battalions if they are within a range. The 92N6E (or 92N2E) is a multi-functional radar with a range, which can track 100 targets. The 5P85TE2 launcher and the 5P85SE2 on a trailer (up to 12 launchers) are used for launch. The 48N6E, 48N6E2, 48N6E3, 48N6DM, 9M96E, 9M96E2, and the ultra-long-range 40N6E missiles have been authorised by a Russian presidential decree. According to the Russian government, the S-400 utilizes an active electronically scanned array.\nOptional elements of the S-400 (98ZH6E) include the 15I6ME–98ZH6E, which extends coverage 30, 60 and 90 km (19, 38 and 57 mi) from that provided by the 30K6E. The 96L6E has a detection range. The 40B6M is housing for the 92N6E or 96L6E radar. The Protivnik-GE is an anti-stealth UHF radar with a range. The Moscow-1 passive sensor is times more effective than the Protivnik, with a range Orion for a target-designation on-the-air defense system, and the Avtobaza-M and Orion+ Avtobaza add high-precision detection. The 1RL220BE versions were reportedly used for jamming. The -range S-200D Dubna (SA-5c) missiles and S-300 P-family radar systems can be used without additional command-and-control centers. S-300 (SA-20A, SA-20B) missiles may also be guided.\nA-50 and A-50U aircraft provide early warning and command-and-control target designation.\n\nThe 30К6Е control system can be integrated with the S-400 Triumf 98ZH6E system; the S-300PMU2 (through the 83М6Е2 control system); the S-300PMU1 (through the 83М6Е control system); the Tor-M1 through the Ranzhir-M battery-command post; the Pantsir-S1 through the lead battery vehicle. The Protivnik-GE and Gamma-DE radars, integrated with the 92H6E radar system, enables communication between each battery with Baikal-E senior command posts and similar types; nearby 30К6Е, 83М6Е and 83М6Е2 administration systems; the Polyana-D4М1 command post; fighter-aircraft command post, and mobile long-range radars. The system's VHF component provides sector search-and-tracking, with the X- and L-band components providing fine-tracking capability. Good placement of the radars relative to the threat axis enables the L- and X-band components to illuminate the incoming target from angles where the target radar cross-section (RCS) is sub-optimal. The RLM-S and RLM-D have better elevation-tracking accuracy than the RLM-M, and the Nebo M should be capable of producing high-quality tracks suitable for mid-course guidance of modern surface-to-air missiles and trajectory guidance of legacy SAMs.\n\nThe Gamma-C1E SHF mobile radar station has a detection range. The Nebo VHF mobile radar station and the Resonance-NE radar station have a detection range of , and to a height of . All Nebo-family locators are doubled for army air defense. During the 1970s, the long-range mobile UHF 5H87, and SHF 5H69 low-altitude locators were used. A goal of the 1980s was detection at a height of at a distance of . The Elbrus-90 computer is used to control the system.\n\nFor export to foreign customers, for integrating existing customer air defense systems, additional work on improvement of the 30K6E administration system for information technology pairing with anti-kets is in progress.\n\nThe 91N6E panoramic radar Has a declared anti-stealth targeting range of \nMaximum targeting ranges (detection ranges are wider) are:\nThe 96L6 high-altitude detector (TSBS) radar and equipment operates independently of the 96L6E low-level radar detector.

The cost of transporters in 2014 is 8.7 million rubles.\n\nOne system comprising up to eight divizion (battalions) can control up to 72 launchers, with a maximum of 384 missiles (including missiles with a range of less than . A gas system launches missiles from the launch tubes up to into the air before rocket motor ignition. In April 2015, a successful test firing of the missile was conducted at an airborne target at a range of ; transporter erector launchers (TELs) carrying the long-range 40N6 may only be able to hold two missiles instead of the typical four due to their large size. Another test recorded a 9M96 missile using an active radar homing head, that reached a height of 56 km. All the missiles are equipped with directed explosion warhead, which increases the probability of complete destruction of targets. In 2016, Russian anti-aircraft missile troops received new guided missiles for S-300 and S-400 defense systems. The anti-aircraft missile system, designed to destroy aircraft, cruise, and ballistic missiles, can also be used against ground targets. The S-400 is able to intercept cruise missiles at a range of about 40 km due to their low-altitude flight paths.\n\n\n\n\nA regular S-400 battalion consists of at least eight launchers with 32 missiles and a mobile command post. On 21 May 2007, the Russian Air Force announced that S-400 would be put on combat duty around Moscow and Central Russia by 1 July 2007. The S-400 was also deployed near the town of Elektrostal.\n\nOn 6 August 2007, the first regiment equipped with S-400 entered active service in Moscow Oblast near Elektrostal, according to Channel One Russia. This was the 606th Guards Anti-air Rocket Regiment, 9th PVO Division, 1st PVO Corps, of the Special Purpose Command.\n\nOn 8 February 2008, Lt. Gen. Vladimir Sviridov announced that Russia would be replacing the S-300 systems in the Northwest of Russia with the S-400. Russian military experts expected that Russia plans for this system to be in place and represent a major component of their ballistic missile defense system until 2020.\n\nIn September 2006, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov announced a new state program of armaments for 2007–15. This program provides for the purchase of 18 missile battalions of S-400s.\n\nOn 17 March 2009, Russia's defense minister announced that a second regiment equipped with advanced S-400 \"Triumph\" air defense missile systems had been put into combat service.\n\nOn 26 August 2009, the General Staff said S-400 systems had been deployed in the Russian Far East to counter possible North Korean missile tests and prevent fragments from falling onto Russian territory.\n\nIn February 2011, a second unit of S-400 missile systems was deployed at Dubrovki, north of Moscow. The 210th Air Defense Regiment consists of two battalions, each consisting of eight launch points, each with four missiles. In February 2011, it was also announced that the missile system will be deployed in the southern Kuril Islands \"to protect Russia's sovereignty in the Far East\".\n\nThe Baltic Fleet in Kaliningrad received S-400 SAM systems which went into operational status in April 2012. One S-400 divizion is deployed on combat duty in the Russian far east city Nakhodka.\n\nAs of 2012, one system (in Electrostal) was operational, with three more S-400 battalions being deployed. All 56 battalions will be delivered by 2020. Russia is also setting up two regiments of S-400 in the Eastern Military district.\n\nAs of September 2013, the Russian Armed Forces had five S-400 regiments: two in Moscow, one in the Pacific fleet, one in the Baltic Fleet, and one in the Southern Military District. From 2014, the army was to receive two to three sets of regimental units of S-400 systems every year. Another S-400 regiment was to be put on combat duty around Moscow by the end of 2013. Russia plans to have 28 S-400 regiments by 2020, each comprising two or three battalions with four systems each, mainly in maritime and border areas.\n\nIn November 2015, it was announced that when the \"Kirov\"-class battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov will be recommissioned to the Russian Navy in 2018, it will be equipped with the 48N6DMK anti-aircraft missile derived from the land-based S-400. The inclusion of the 48N6DMK into the \"Kirov\"'s arsenal extends its air defense range from with the 48N6E2 missile from the S-300FM to . Northern Fleet Commander Adm. Vladimir Korolev commented in that same year that Russia's Northern Fleet's Coastal Forces had deployed S-400s.\n\nOn 1 March 2016, the acting commander of the 14th Air Force and Air Defense Army, major general Vladimir Korytkov, said that six S-400 units had been activated according to his order in the anti-aircraft missile regiment of the Novosibirsk air defense formation in Russia's Novosibirsk Oblast. TASS also reported that as of the end of 2015, a total of eleven Russian missile regiments were armed with S-400, and by the end of 2016 their number was expected to increase to sixteen.\n\nIn November 2015, it was reported S-400 will be deployed to Syria, along with the contingent of Russian troops and other military hardware in the course of the air campaign conducted by the Russian forces on the side of the Syrian government. However, those claims were refuted by Russia. On 25 November 2015, the Russian government announced it would deploy S-400s in Syria as a response to the downing of its Su-24M jet by Turkey. On 26 November 2015, deployment of S-400 air defense systems to Syria was underway. The first S-400 unit was activated at the Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia Governorate.\n\nIn April and July 2017, a second S-400 unit was activated 13 km northwest of Masyaf, Hama Governorate.\n\nOn 24 August 2007, Belarus submitted a formal request for supply of two S-400 battalions. In 2011, State Secretary of the Union State of Russia and Belarus Pavel Borodin has stated that Russia will supply the S-400 air defense system to Belarus. In June 2016, Belarus received two S-400 units free of charge from Russia.\n\nIn March 2014, it was announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin had given authorization to sell the S-400 system to China. On 13 April 2015, the chief executive of the Russian state-run arms trader Rosoboronexport confirmed that China secured a contract for the purchase of the S-400 air defence systems. Delivery of the system began in January 2018. China test fired Russian S-400 systems for the first time in early August 2018.\n\nThe acquisition of S-400, reported to initially consist of six batteries, significantly improved the country's ability to defend its own air space and served as an effective stand-off weapon against air attacks. With a coverage range, aircraft in disputed areas off the coast could be targeted by SAMs from the mainland; all of Taiwan could be covered from Fujian, and the Diaoyu Islands could be covered from Shandong, making it difficult for the US and Japan to deploy combat aircraft over those airspaces. Taiwan sought to address these potential advantages by locating activated S-400 batteries using extensive signals intelligence units and destroying them with stand-off weapons, cruise and ballistic missiles, and anti-radiation missiles.\n\nAlthough viewed as a \"game changer\" in the region, several factors may constrain S-400's effectiveness in East Asia. Though the 40N6 missile has a range of 400 km, it is not known if such a missile is available for export. Even if China does acquire the missile, the disputed Diaoyu Islands would be at the limit of its range if stationed along the coast, as would the Indian capital New Delhi if stationed right on the border in the Himalaya Mountains. Against Taiwan, only the 40N6 could bring all its airspace in range, but deploying it along the coast of Fujian province at sea level would prevent it from locating low-level aircraft at long range due to the Earth's curvature; the shorter-range 48N6 would be even less useful against maneuvering targets at long range. These issues, along with dangers of misidentifying and engaging friendly aircraft at such great distances, may restrict Chinese S-400 to defensive purposes.\n\nDuring the 2009 International Defence Industry Fair in Istanbul, Turkey expressed an interest in acquiring the S-400 air defence system. In late 2017, the president of Turkey and Russian officials signed a US$2.5 billion agreement for delivery of the S-400 air defence system units. The US Secretary of State raised concerns over the deal, but President Erdogan and other Turkish officials rejected the US threat of sanctions, citing existing international protocols agreed to by Turkey and Russia and that the S-400 offer with Russia was a better deal than the MIM-104 Patriot system offered by US. Turkey received its first installment of the Russian S-400 missile defense system on 12 July 2019. The US threatened Turkey with CAATSA sanctions and on 17 July suspended Turkey from the F-35 program, stating \"F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities\". As of 2020, 4 batteries consisting of 36 fire units, and 192+ missiles were delivered to Turkey.\n\nIn September 2009, it was reported that the S-400 was a part of a US$2 billion arms deal being negotiated between Russia and Saudi Arabia. The agreement was reportedly delayed due to Saudis trying to acquire the more advanced S-400 but Russia was willing to sell only the S-300 air defence systems at the time. In October 2017, agreement was reached about the delivery of the S-400 air defense systems to Saudi Arabia. In November 2019, it was reported that the deal had still not been finalized.\n\nOn 15 October 2016, during the BRICS Summit, India and Russia signed an Inter-governmental Agreement (IGA) for the supply of five S-400 regiments. The US$5.43 billion deal (₹40,000 crore) was formally signed on 5 October 2018, ignoring threat of US sanctions. The deliveries are expected to commence by the end of 2020 and brought into service in October 2020. The United States threatened India with sanctions over India's decision to buy the S-400 missile defense system from Russia.\n\nIn September 2007, Vice Chairman of Russia's State Duma, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, urged that \"S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems should be delivered as soon as possible to enable Iran to defend its airspace.\". In June 2019, amid tensions with the United States, some Iranian officials expressed interest for procurement of the S-400 missile system to further improve nation's defense capabilities along with previously bought S-300PMU2. Russia stated that it is ready to sell the S-400 system to Iran if an official request is made.\n\nSouth Korea is developing a simplified medium range SAM system, M-SAM \"Cheolmae-2\", based on technology from the 9M96 missile and with help of the Almaz. The prime contractor is Samsung Thales, a joint venture between Samsung and Thales. The M-SAM will be composed of an X band multi-function radar vehicle built by Samsung Thales in technical cooperation with Almaz, fire-control vehicles and transporter erector launchers built by Doosan, and missiles provided by LIG Nex1.\n\nIn February 2017, Sergey Chemezov, CEO of Rostec, stated that Egypt was interested in the S-400 air defense system. He explained that Russia offered to sell Egypt either the Antey-2500 or S-400. According to Chemezov, the negotiations were delayed due to Egypt's financial issues.\n\nIn February 2018, Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs Ibrahim al-Jaafari confirmed ongoing rumors that his country had shown interest in the S-400 and that negotiations with Russia were underway. In May 2019, the ambassador of Iraq to Russia, Haidar Mandour Hadi, said that the Iraqi government had decided to procure the S-400 air defence system.\n\nIn January 2018, Russian state media TASS reported that Qatar was in an advanced state of talks to procure the S-400 air defense system.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan stated on RT that Pakistan had the option of purchasing the S-400 air defense system from Russia but would not be doing so for the time being.\n\nTurkish Air Force: \n\n\n\n\n"}

It picks up the story of twins Kestrel and Bowman five years on from the closing chapter of \"The Wind Singer\". It was first published in 2001.\n\nAt the beginning of the book, the city of Aramanth is greatly changed since events in \"The Wind Singer\". The walls have been torn down, and the poorer districts abandoned. No longer is it run by the strict system of exams; in fact, everyone is pleasant and docile. The change occurred because the city had been released from the grip of an evil force known as the Morah.\n\nThis new freedom, however, has also severely weakened the city. News of this reaches as far as a distant country known as the Mastery. The country sends an army of a thousand, commanded by young Marius Semeon Ortiz, to destroy the city and take its entire population as slaves. They do so, killing many of the city's residents, enslaving yet more, and leaving no survivors, except for Kestrel Hath. She vows to have revenge on the unknown Mastery, and on Ortiz himself, and begins to follow the trail led by the returning army.\n\nThe Manth people are brought to the Mastery, a beautiful country built up entirely on slave labor. They are branded and given jobs. Though some of the people begin to actually enjoy work, as they discover that every single person in the Mastery is a slave (except for the Master, ruler of the land, himself). Hanno Hath, father of Kestrel, signs up to be a librarian, while his son Bowman decides to become a night watchman, in order to listen for his approaching sister.\n\nKestrel, meanwhile, faints with exhaustion on her journey. She is rescued by the beautiful Sirharasi (Sisi), Johdila of Gang. As one of the few people who has seen Sisi unveiled, Kestrel becomes her servant and mutual friend. She discovers that Sisi is also travelling to the Mastery to marry Ortiz, the man who led the attack on Aramanth. Kestrel decides to try to use the considerable might of Gang's army, the Johjan Guards, to overthrow the Mastery, and she convinces Zohon, the Guards' conceited leader, that Sisi loves him, and that she will give him a sign to show this.\n\nWhile on a night watch, Bowman is approached by an ancient, one-eyed hermit known as \"Dogface\", who tells Bowman that, as the son of the prophet (Bowman's mother, Ira Hath, is descended from the ancient prophet, Ira Manth), he has great powers that belong to the Singer people. Bowman tests these new powers by speaking with a cow, moving a stick without touching it, and later speaking to a cat, Mist, that Dogface leaves behind. Mist's ambition is to learn how to fly, but as Bowman's powers are initially limited and untested, he doesn't and can't teach Mist.\n\nMeanwhile, Mumpo, another Manth slave, joins the Manaxa. The Manaxa is a fight where two competitors attempt to stab each other with spiked armor until either one dies or is driven out of the arena, and is considered a great honor to compete in the Mastery. He shows considerable talent at this and at the wedding kills the reigning champion and heavy favorite.\n\nAt the wedding Sisi and Ortiz both fall for people other than those intended, Sisi for Bowman and Ortiz for Kestrel, and chaos ensues. Zohan, believing he is rescuing Sisi from the Mastery, instigates a battle against Ortiz and his men; however the entire population of the Mastery, bound by the Master's will, attacks and outnumbers Zohon's army. Mumpo begins searching for Kestrel to try to save her in the chaos, killing anyone he encounters whether they be Mastery Citizens or in the Johjan Guards. Bowman, using his mind powers, engages in a mind duel with the Master. Kestrel and Ortiz come in. Bowman is temporarily distracted and the Master exploits this and commands Ortiz to kill Kestrel. Despite his love for her, he is unable to resist the Master's will and obeys. With the sword centimeters from her heart, Bowman kills the Master and Ortiz is released from his will. Mumpo enters the room and sees Ortiz with his arms around Kestrel, and gets the wrong idea. Mumpo smashes Ortiz's head and breaks his neck. Released from his power, the Master's army dissipates and sets about destroying the city in a frenzy, and Zohon seizes control.\n\nFinally free to leave, Ira Hath asserts that they must seek out the homeland, as \"the wind is rising\". Though many of the Manth people choose to stay behind and make a life for themselves where they are, a small group resolve to trust in Ira's prophecy, and together along with Sisi and her servant Lunki, they set out in search of the homeland.\n\nNicholson's Official Website \n"}

{"id": "1931138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931138", "title": "Celtics–Lakers rivalry", "text": "Celtics–Lakers rivalry\n\nThe Celtics–Lakers rivalry is a National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers. The Celtics and the Lakers are the two most storied franchises in the NBA, and the rivalry has often been called the greatest in the NBA. The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in . They would both go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, and two times in 2008 and 2010.\n\nThe two teams have won the two highest numbers of championships in the NBA: the Celtics have won 17, and the Lakers have won 16 (11 as the L.A. Lakers and 5 as the Minneapolis Lakers). Together, they account for 33 of the 72 championships in NBA history. As of 2018, the Celtics and Lakers have a .590 and .596 all-time winning records respectively. As of the end of the 2017–18 season, Boston is the only team with a winning overall record against the Lakers.\n\nThe rivalry has been less intense since the retirements of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson in the early 1990s. In 2008 the two teams met in the NBA Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They met again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games.\n\nDuring the first decade of the NBA in the 1950s, the Minneapolis Lakers had the first NBA dynasty. Minneapolis would win the first ever Championship Series of the newly formed NBA in 1950 (three BAA Finals were played between 1947–1949 and retroactively counted as NBA Championships, one of which was won by the Lakers in 1949). Under Hall of Fame head coach John Kundla, and with the NBA's first superstar in George Mikan, they would win three more titles in 1952, 1953, and 1954. The Celtics would emerge behind early NBA star Bob Cousy by winning the 1957 NBA Finals and losing in 1958.\nThe first NBA Finals match-up between the two teams was in 1959 when on April 9, the Boston Celtics swept the Minneapolis Lakers 4-0 for the first sweep in the history of the NBA Finals. This would mark the first Finals loss for the previously dominant Lakers, and the first of eight straight titles for Boston.\n\nThe Lakers relocated to Los Angeles in 1960. It was after this move, and during this decade, that the rivalry would truly escalate. The two teams emerged as the strongest in the NBA, featuring greats such as Bill Russell, Tom Heinsohn, John Havlicek, Sam Jones and head coach Red Auerbach for Boston and Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Gail Goodrich, and coach/GM Fred Schaus for Los Angeles. However, it would ultimately prove to be the decade of the Celtics, who won the finals every year in the 1960s except for 1967. The Lakers would be the Celtics opponent in six of those series: 1962, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1968, and 1969. The Celtics won all of those match-ups. Three of those series (1962, 1966, and 1969) went seven games. The Celtics win over the Lakers in 1966 marked an unprecedented eight consecutive championships, the longest streak of any North American professional sports team.\n\nThe Lakers acquired Wilt Chamberlain in 1968, which brought the personal rivalry between him and Bill Russell, previously a feature of the Celtics-76ers rivalry, to Celtics-Lakers. The Lakers posted the best record in the West during the 1968–1969 season. By contrast, the aging Celtics struggled to obtain the fourth seed, with Russell and Jones playing in their final seasons. Despite this, the Celtics upset the Philadelphia 76ers and the New York Knicks and made it to the Finals. The Lakers had home court advantage for the first time and won the first two games, but the Celtics rebounded to force and win a dramatic Game 7 at the Los Angeles Forum, defying Laker's owner Jack Kent Cooke's infamous prediction of a Lakers celebration. West was named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team, but it was small consolation in a decade where the Lakers went without a championship, every one of their Finals' losses in that decade coming at the hands of the Celtics.\nThe 1969 Finals also caused a deterioration in the relationship between Russell and Chamberlain, who had previously been friends despite their rivalry, into one of intense loathing, when Chamberlain took himself out of the decisive Game 7 with six minutes left, and Russell thereafter accused Chamberlain of being a malingerer and of \"copping out\" of the game when it seemed that the Lakers would lose. Chamberlain (whose knee was so bad that he could not play the entire offseason and ruptured it in the next season) was livid at Russell and saw him as a backstabber. The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years until Russell attempted to patch things up, although he never uttered a genuine apology. When Chamberlain died in 1999, Chamberlain's nephew stated that Russell was the second person he was ordered to break the news to.\n\nThe Celtics and Lakers both found success in the 1970s, but there would be no rematch between the two teams.\n\nThe start of the decade saw the Lakers' woes in the NBA Finals continue, with a loss to the New York Knicks in 1970. However, the Lakers rebounded two years later to win the 1972 NBA Finals and their first championship in Los Angeles, also against the Knicks. This would also prove to be Laker great Jerry West's only NBA title. The following year, the Lakers again faced the Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals and lost. They would not make it to the Finals again in this decade, but in 1975 they acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nThe Celtics won the NBA Finals in 1974, and won again in 1976, under the leadership of coach Tom Heinsohn and players Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and Jo Jo White.\n\nNeither team won another championship until the 1980s. However, the foundation for the renewed Celtics–Lakers rivalry of the 1980s was actually laid down in college basketball of the late 1970s. During the 1978–79 NCAA season, Michigan State was led by Magic Johnson to the championship game of the NCAA Tournament, where they faced Indiana State University, which was led by senior Larry Bird. In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever, Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75–64, and Johnson was voted Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Johnson would go on to be drafted by the Lakers, and Bird by the Celtics. The personal rivalry formed by these two basketball greats during college would transfer to their NBA careers, and reignite the rivalry between the two storied franchises that they came to represent.\n\nThe Celtics–Lakers rivalry was renewed in the 1980s, in large part due to the personal rivalry between Bird and Johnson. Magic said of the games against the Celtics, \"when the new schedule would come out each year, I'd grab it and circle the Boston games. To me, it was \"The Two\" and the other 80.\" Similarly, Bird said that, \"the first thing I would do every morning was look at the box scores to see what Magic did. I didn't care about anything else.\"\n\nThe Showtime Lakers struck the first blow, winning the 1980 NBA Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers. The following year, behind the \"Big Three\" of future Hall of Famers Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the Celtics won the 1981 NBA Finals against the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe Celtics lost the 1982 Eastern Conference Finals to the 76ers, and along with it the possibility of a rematch with the Lakers. However, the final game of that series is memorable to the rivalry because Boston fans chanted for the 76ers, who were just about to eliminate their Celtics, to \"Beat L.A.!\" Despite the encouragement, the 76ers lost the 1982 NBA Finals to the Lakers, who were led by new head coach Pat Riley. However, the 76ers defeated the Lakers the following year in the 1983 NBA Finals. The 1982–1983 season would also be the rookie year of Laker James Worthy, another Hall of Famer in the storied rivalry.\n\nThe Celtics would get a new head coach in K.C. Jones, who was also a former Celtics player, and two teams finally had their long-awaited rematch in the 1984 NBA Finals, a grueling seven game series that had many memorable moments, including a 137–104 blowout in Game 3 that led Bird to call his Celtic teammates \"sissies\", the Kevin McHale takedown of Laker forward Kurt Rambis which led to increased physical aggression by both teams, the sweltering heat of the infamously un-airconditioned Boston Garden in Game 5, and Cedric Maxwell's 24-point performance in Game 7. The Celtics went on to win in seven games, increasing their record of Finals' series victories against the Lakers to 8–0.\n\nThe following year, the Lakers finally had their revenge, winning the 1985 NBA Finals by taking Game 6 in Boston Garden, becoming the only visiting team to win an NBA championship in that arena. Lakers owner Jerry Buss famously remarked that \"this has removed the most odious sentence in the English language. It can never again be said that 'the Lakers have never beaten the Celtics'\".\n\nThe Celtics rebounded the following year to win the 1986 NBA Finals against the Rockets. In the 1987 NBA Finals, the two teams met for a tie-breaker of their 1980s Finals matches, and the Lakers once again emerged victorious in six games, with the iconic image of Johnson's junior sky hook. This series marked the end of an era for the Celtics. They did not reach the Finals again until 2008. The Lakers, meanwhile, went on to win the 1988 NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons, before losing to the Pistons the following year in 1989, and win titles again in 2000, 2001 and 2002, all while the Celtics wallowed in mediocrity.\n\nSeveral journalists hypothesized that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness (\"Lakers Showtime\") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit (\"Celtic Pride\"), and between blacks and whites. A 1984 Converse commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court when Johnson pulls up in a sleek limousine and challenges him to a one-on-one match. Despite their on the court rivalry, the two became friends after filming the commercial together.\n\nThe rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans. The rivalry between Bird, Johnson, and their teams contributed greatly to the success of the league during the decade; according to Bryant Gumbel, \"Magic and Larry saved the NBA.\" Sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN asserted that Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy. In every single NBA Finals series during the 1980s, either the Lakers or the Celtics were present.\n\nPlaying off their rivalry in the NCAA and NBA, Johnson and Bird reunited to promote Game 5 of the 2018 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers (of which Johnson is a part-owner) and Boston Red Sox. In contrast to the frequent Lakers-Celtics championship match-ups, the Dodgers and Red Sox were meeting in the World Series for the first time (since the Dodgers franchise relocated to Los Angeles).\n\nDuring the 1990s, the rivalry died down. Only the Lakers made an appearance in the NBA Finals that decade, losing the 1991 NBA Finals to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, the first championship in the Bulls' dynasty. This would prove to be a defining moment of the NBA, a changing of the old guard as the Lakers and Celtics fell into mediocrity, while the Bulls won six titles led by Jordan, Scottie Pippen and coach Phil Jackson, who would cement their respective reputations as the greatest player and coach in NBA history. Both teams also faced set backs in the form of personal misfortune. On November 7, 1991, Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately. Celtics star Reggie Lewis died of a heart attack in his prime in 1993, further marring the team in tragedy since second overall pick Len Bias died of a drug overdose two days after he was drafted in 1986. In 1994, neither the Lakers \"nor\" the Celtics made the playoffs, marking the first time in the history of the NBA that both teams missed the playoffs in the same season.\n\nHowever, the Lakers began the rebuilding process in 1996 by trading for Kobe Bryant, who was drafted from high school that year by the Charlotte Hornets. That same year, the Lakers signed Shaquille O'Neal. Meanwhile, in 1998, the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce, a native of Inglewood, California who had grown up as a Lakers fan. The following year, in 1999, Phil Jackson joined the Lakers as head coach.\n\nThe Lakers returned to prominence in the early 2000s. Under Jackson's guidance, and with O'Neal and Bryant leading the way, the Lakers won three straight championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. The Lakers' title in 2000 came against the Indiana Pacers who were coached by Celtic legend Bird. Paul Pierce's nickname, \"The Truth\", was accorded to him by Shaquille O'Neal after a 112-107 Lakers' victory over the Celtics on March 13, 2001 in which Pierce scored 42 points on 13 of 19 shooting. O'Neal pulled a Boston reporter over and gestured toward his notepad. \"Take this down\", said O'Neal. \"My name is Shaquille O'Neal and Paul Pierce is the [expletive] truth. Quote me on that and don't take nothing out. I knew he could play, but I didn't know he could play like this. Paul Pierce is the truth.\" In 2002, the Celtics, with Pierce and Antoine Walker, made an impressive run for the Finals and the two teams narrowly missed each other. However, the Celtics eventually fell in six games to the New Jersey Nets in that year's Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe Lakers returned to the Finals in 2004 but lost at the hands of the Detroit Pistons. Thereafter, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. Without O'Neal, the Lakers missed the playoffs the following year and failed to advance to the Finals for the next three years.\n\nThe Celtics likewise made little playoff progress after their near Finals run of 2002. In 2004, they hired head coach Doc Rivers. In 2007, they made blockbuster trades for All-Stars Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, who complemented career-long Celtics star Paul Pierce and emerging star Rajon Rondo.\n\nWith the addition of Allen and Garnett alongside Pierce to become the new \"Big Three\", the Celtics returned to the top of the NBA in the 2007–2008 season by posting the best record in the league and reaching the Finals. The Lakers also returned to the Finals with the help of the mid-season acquisition of Pau Gasol, and the two teams finally met again in the 2008 NBA Finals. The Celtics won in six games with an impressive come-from-behind victory in Game 4 and a blow-out of the Lakers in Game 6. The next season, the Lakers and Celtics played a regular season game on Christmas Day. The Lakers won that game, making Phil Jackson the fastest coach to win 1,000 games. They went on to win the 2009 NBA Finals that season, but the Celtics were eliminated by eventual Eastern Conference champions Orlando Magic. In 2009, the Lakers signed Ron Artest (now Metta World Peace).\n\nThe summer before the 2009–2010 season, Phil Jackson ran into Paul Pierce and told him, \"Get it back, we want to meet you in the Finals.\" The Lakers ended the season with the West's best record, while the Celtics would enter the playoffs as the number four seed. Build up for a rematch began with the Lakers taking a 2–0 lead over the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference Finals, with chants of \"We Want Boston!\" erupting in the Staples Center. Likewise, chants of \"Beat L.A.!\" erupted up in TD Garden as the Celtics took a commanding 3–0 lead over the Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals. Both teams fended off late series surges from their opponents, but won their respective series 4–2, setting up a rematch in the 2010 NBA Finals.\n\nThe 2010 series had many memorable moments, including impressive performances from Bryant who led in points for six of the seven games, Ray Allen's Finals' record eight 3-pointers in Game 2, Derek Fisher carrying his team to victory and then crying in Game 3, a hard-fought Game 4 where Glen Davis screamed so loud he drooled while Nate Robinson rode on his back, a dominant Lakers performance in Game 6, and a close Game 7 that became the highest rated NBA game since Michael Jordan's second retirement in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. The Lakers won Game 7 against the Celtics for their very first time, bringing their total number of NBA championships to sixteen (they have one NBL championship in 1948), just one fewer than the Celtics' seventeen.\n\nThe Celtics signed Shaquille O'Neal for the 2010–2011 season to replace the injured Kendrick Perkins, adding to the rivalry by bringing the Shaq-Kobe feud to the Celtics-Lakers. During a game against the Lakers on February 11, 2011, Ray Allen became the all-time NBA leader in total 3-point field goals made. However, both the Lakers and Celtics would be eliminated in the second round of the playoffs that year by the 2011 NBA Finals participants, the Dallas Mavericks and Miami Heat, respectively. The following year they would again both be eliminated by the eventual 2012 NBA Finals participants, the Oklahoma City Thunder and Miami Heat, respectively. With the disbanding of Boston's Big Three, and anticipated changes to the Lakers' roster, some believe that the 2011–12 NBA season was the last chapter of the current Celtics–Lakers rivalry.\n\nOn February 20, 2013, the Lakers played their first game since the death of long time owner Jerry Buss who had died two days earlier, paying tribute to him at the Staples Center before facing off against the Celtics. The Lakers won 113-99 in a game that saw Steve Nash pass former Lakers star Johnson for fourth on the all-time NBA assist list.\n\nOn December 30, 2015, the Boston Celtics honored the Los Angeles Lakers' star Kobe Bryant in his final game in TD Garden. The Lakers would beat the Celtics 112-104.\n\nBoth the Celtics and Lakers missed the playoffs in the 2013–14 season, marking only the second time it has happened in the rivalry's history. With the New York Knicks also failing to make the playoffs that season, it marked the first time in NBA history that neither the Celtics, Lakers nor the Knicks qualified for the playoffs in the same season.\n\nBut while the Celtics were able to return to the playoffs over the next three seasons and even made the Eastern Conference Finals in 2017 and 2018, the Lakers found themselves in a lengthy rebuilding process. Prior to 2014, the Lakers only missed the playoffs four times since moving to Los Angeles, and five times in franchise history. However, the Lakers proceeded to miss the playoffs a record six consecutive seasons, highlighted by four straight seasons with over 50 losses and a franchise-low 17–65 mark during the 2015–16 season.\n\nNevertheless, the rivalry between the Celtics and the Lakers remained fairly even during this recent period, with the two teams managing a split in the season series four of the last six times. However, battles between the Celtics and the Lakers took a back seat to the emerging rivalry between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors, who met in four consecutive NBA Finals between 2015 and 2018, where the Cavaliers were led by a big three of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love, while the Warriors were led by a big four of Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.\n\nNotwithstanding the Celtics' success and the Lakers' struggles during this period, both teams would make their presence felt in subsequent offseasons. The Lakers' run of futility rewarded them with several high first-round picks (D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball were selected second overall), while the Celtics benefited from the Brooklyn Nets' ill-fated 2013 trade for Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett with their top-three selections of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. In addition, the Celtics went on to sign All-Star free agents Al Horford and Gordon Hayward in addition to acquiring Kyrie Irving from the Cavaliers. The Lakers would counter by signing LeBron James in the 2018 offseason. The two teams continued to retool in the 2019 offseason; the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans while the Celtics brought in Kemba Walker after Irving left to join the Nets.\n\nThis was the first NBA Finals series between the Lakers and the Celtics, and the only such meeting to occur while the Lakers were still in Minneapolis. Minneapolis hadn't made an appearance in the Finals since winning four of the first five NBA Championships between 1950–1954, while Boston was making its third straight Finals appearance after winning in 1957 and losing in 1958.\nMinneapolis, led by rookie sensation Elgin Baylor, made the Finals by defeating the defending World Champion St. Louis Hawks. Boston would face a tough seven-game series against the Syracuse Nationals but would eventually emerge victorious, leading Celtic star Bob Cousy to predict that Boston would sweep Minneapolis. Cousy would prove his prediction correct, leading his team with 51 total assists (still a record for a four-game NBA Finals series) to defeat the Minneapolis Lakers in the first 4–0 sweep ever in the NBA Finals. This marked the first of Boston's record eight straight titles.\n\nThis was the first NBA Finals series between the Lakers and Celtics after the Lakers moved to Los Angeles.\n\nBoston would win game one. However, the Lakers would edge out for close victories in Game 2 and Game 3. The Celtics would win Game 4 before the Lakers would come back and win another close victory in Game 5. In the Game 5 victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61, despite fouling out of the game. The Celtics won Game 6 to set up the first Game 7 between the two franchises.\n\nIn Game 7, Laker Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game, missed a potential title-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later. Instead, the game went into overtime and the Celtics won by three points.\n\nThe Lakers and Celtics would meet the following year in 1963. The Celtics would again defeat the Lakers.\n\nThe Celtics took the first two games, but the Lakers would blow the Celtics out with a 20-point differential in Game 3. Although the Celtics would take Game 4, the Lakers would win Game 5 and fuel speculation that the young Lakers were about to surge past the older Celtics. A defiant Bill Russell denied that any such thing was going to happen. Sure enough, despite several close games, including the decisive game only having a three-point differential once again, the Celtics would only require six games to close out the Lakers this time.\n\nThis series would also be notable for its future implications in NBA telecasts. When angry crowds showed up in Los Angeles to buy playoff tickets that were not available, the Lakers quieted the crowd by offering closed circuit TV viewing for $2.50 a head. \"We were aware we were testing the future of pay television\", Lakers general manager Lou Mohs told reporters.\n\nThe Celtics would make their ninth straight appearance in the NBA Finals and face the Lakers for the fourth time. Celtics founder Walter A. Brown died during the season, and Red Auerbach led the team back to the Finals with his first Coach of the Year award. The Celtics defeated the Philadelphia 76ers to enter the Finals, marked by Johnny Most's famous call of \"Havlicek stole the ball!\"\n\nUnlike their previous two encounters, the Celtics dominated the Lakers, who were playing without an injured Elgin Baylor, and only Game 2 had a close score. The Celtics would win the series in Game 5 with a 129–96 victory over the Lakers. This was the largest margin of victory in a deciding Finals game, and would not be broken until 2008, when the Celtics defeated the Lakers once again by a score of 131–92.\n\nThis was the Boston Celtics' eighth consecutive NBA Championship, a feat unrivaled in North American professional sports. Despite finishing second in the division standings for the first time in a decade, Boston would return to the Finals for a record tenth straight time .\n\nAfter the Los Angeles Lakers' comeback overtime win in Game 1, Red Auerbach, who had challenged the entire league to topple the Celtics from their reign by announcing he would retire after 1965–1966 before the season had started (thus giving his detractors \"one last shot\" at him), announced Bill Russell as the Celtics coach for 1966–1967 and beyond, the first African-American coach in the NBA. Laker coach Fred Schaus privately fumed that Red's hiring had taken away all of the accolades his Lakers should have received following their tremendous Game 1 win.\n\nThe Celtics won the next three games and looked ready to close out L.A. in Game 5. However, behind the efforts of Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, and Gail Goodrich, the Lakers won the next two games, setting the stage for another classic Game 7 in the Boston Garden. The Celtics raced out to a huge lead, but down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which fell just short. The Celtics fended off the late Los Angeles rally to capture the NBA title and send Red Auerbach out a champion.\n\nAfter they both missed the NBA Finals in 1967, the Lakers and the Celtics would meet again in 1968. Boston's streak of 10 consecutive Finals appearances had been snapped in 1967 by the 76ers. The 1968 Eastern Division Finals rematch between the Celtics and the 76ers was marred by the recent assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., but the decision was made not to delay the series.\n\nThe Lakers, led by new head coach Butch van Breda Kolff, would actually root for the Celtics to win the series, thinking that Bill Russell would be easier to defeat than 76er Wilt Chamberlain (Chamberlain would become a Laker the following season). The Lakers would get what they wished for and face the Celtics, but ultimately to the same result. The Celtics won Game 1, and the two teams would alternate victories through Game 5. Game 5 was notable for an impressive Lakers' comeback sending it into overtime, but the Celtics would ultimately win that game. In Game 6, the Celtics closed out the Lakers in convincing fashion with a 124–109 victory.\n\nWith Bill Russell and Sam Jones in their final season, and plagued with injuries, the Celtics struggled to make the NBA playoffs as the fourth and final seed in the Eastern Conference. They upset the 76ers in the first round and postponed New York's finals appearance for another year. Awaiting the Celtics were the powerful Los Angeles Lakers who had a nucleus of Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and newly acquired Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nAfter losing the first two games in the Forum in L.A., no one thought Boston would even pull out a victory. However, they won Game 3 and a buzzer-beater by Sam Jones tied the series up at two games apiece. The home team won Games 5 and 6 which set up a dramatic seventh game. Before the game started, Laker's owner Jack Kent Cooke placed flyers in every seat stating \"When, not if, the Lakers win the title, balloons will be released from the raftors, the USC marching band will play \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" and broadcaster Chick Hearn will interview Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain in that order.\" Before the game, the Celtics circulated in their locker room a memo about the Lakers' celebration plans. Russell noted the giant net hanging from the ceiling during pregame warmups and said to West, \"Those [expletive deleted] balloons are staying up there.\" West was furious at the balloons for providing the Celtics extra motivation.\n\nBoston played tough through the first half and would keep the game close, with a score of 60–60. Remarkably, Boston would pull away and entered the fourth quarter up by 18. It seemed to be over when Lakers center Wilt Chamberlain was injured and replaced by reserve Mel Counts. The Celtics, however, would begin to show their age when they began missing shots and turning the ball over and Laker Jerry West pulled L.A. to within one. Despite having numerous opportunities, the Lakers couldn't get over the hump and Don Nelson would make an incredible foul-line jump-shot which bounced off the back iron and fell in. During this, another battle was heating up off the court between Jack Kent Cooke and Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff. Chamberlain was pleading for Breda Kolff to put him back in, but he refused. Cooke then came down to personally order the defiant coach to insert Wilt, but to no avail. This would prove critical as the Celtics held on and triumphed 108–106.\n\nThe first ever Finals MVP award was given to Jerry West, despite being on the losing team (thus far the only time this has happened). Despite this, West was inconsolable. In a show of good sportsmanship, Bill Russell held West's hand and John Havlicek said: \"I love you, Jerry!\"\n\nBy virtue of a 62–20 record, the Celtics had homecourt advantage over the Lakers who finished the regular season with a 54–28 mark. The Celtics defeated the Lakers four games to three.\n\nThe Lakers opened the series with a 115–109 victory at the Boston Garden. In Game 2, the Lakers led 113–111 with 18 seconds left when Gerald Henderson stole a James Worthy pass to score a game tying layup and the Celtics eventually prevailed in overtime 124–121. In Game 3, the Lakers raced to an easy 137–104 victory as Johnson dished out 21 assists. After the game, Bird said his team played like \"sissies\" in an attempt to light a fire under his teammates. In Game 4, the Lakers had a five-point game lead with less than a minute to play, but made several execution errors as the Celtics tied the game and then came away with a 129–125 victory in overtime. The game was also marked by Celtic forward Kevin McHale's takedown of Laker forward Kurt Rambis on a breakaway layup which triggered the physical aspect of the rivalry. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would go after Bird later on in the third quarter, and 1981 Finals MVP Cedric Maxwell further antagonized the Lakers by following a missed James Worthy free throw by crossing the lane with his hands around his own neck, symbolizing that Worthy was \"choking\" under pressure. In Game 5, the Celtics took a 3–2 series lead as Bird scored 34 points. The game was known as the \"Heat Game\", as it was played under 97 °F-heat, and without any air conditioning at the infamous Boston Garden. In Game 6, the Lakers evened the series with a 119–108 victory. In the game, the Lakers answered the Celtics rough tactics when Worthy shoved Cedric Maxwell into a basket support. After the game, a Laker fan threw a beer at Celtics guard M.L. Carr as he left the floor, causing him to label the series \"all-out-war.\" In Game 7, the Celtics were led by Cedric Maxwell, who had 24 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists as they came away with a 111–102 victory. In the game the Lakers rallied from a 14-point deficit to three points down with one minute remaining, when Maxwell knocked the ball away from Magic Johnson. Dennis Johnson responded by sinking two free throws to seal the Celtics' victory. Bird was named MVP of the series.\n\nThe Celtics, looking to repeat as NBA Champions, had homecourt advantage for the second year in a row as they finished the regular season with a 63–19 record while the Lakers compiled a 62–20 record. For the first time, the Finals went to a 2–3–2 format with games one and two in Boston while the next three games were in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Celtics four games to two. Game 1 became known as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\" as the Celtics soundly beat the Lakers 148–114. Celtic reserve forward Scott Wedman made all 11 out of 11 field goal attempts. The Lakers responded in Game 2 with a 109–102 victory as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 30 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists, and three blocks. Michael Cooper had 22 points, making 8 out of 9 field goals attempted. In Game 3, the Celtics had a 48–38 lead in the second quarter before the Lakers, led by James Worthy, took a 65–59 lead at halftime and then pulled away in the second half to come away with a 136–111 victory. Worthy had 29 points while Abdul-Jabbar had 26 points and 14 rebounds. The Celtics tied the series in Game 4, 107–105 as Dennis Johnson hit a jumper at the buzzer. In Game 5, the Lakers raced out to a 64–51 lead and stretched it to 89–72 before the Celtics cut the deficit to 101–97 with six minutes remaining. However, Magic Johnson made three shots while Abdul-Jabbar added four more shots, and the Lakers came away with a 120–111 victory to take a 3–2 series lead. Abdul-Jabbar led the Lakers with 36 points. The series shifted to Boston with only one full day off for both teams. In Game 6, the Lakers were led by Abdul-Jabbar who scored 29 points as the Lakers defeated the Celtics 111–100. Magic had a triple-double with 15 points, 14 assists, and 10 rebounds; Worthy had 28 points on 11 for 15 shooting. It was the only time a visiting team claimed an NBA championship in Boston Garden. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was named MVP of the series, making him the oldest player (38 years, 1 month, 24 days) ever to win the MVP of an NBA Finals series.\n\nAfter being eliminated in the Western Conference Finals a year earlier, the Lakers returned to the NBA Finals and were awarded homecourt advantage as they accumulated a 65–17 record while the Celtics finished the season with a 59–23 record.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Celtics four games to two. In Game 1, the Los Angeles Lakers came away with a 126–113 victory. Magic Johnson had 29 points, 13 assists, and 8 rebounds, while James Worthy had 33 points, 10 assists, and 9 rebounds. In Game 2, the Lakers took a 2–0 series lead with a 141–122 victory. Magic had 22 points and 20 assists, while Michael Cooper made six three-point shots, then a record for most three-pointers made in a single NBA Finals game. In Game 3, the Celtics posted a 109–103 win, led by Bird, who had 30 points and 12 rebounds. In Game 4, the Celtics had a 16-point lead in the third quarter before the Lakers stormed back into the game. Bird had hit a three-point bomb with 12 seconds remaining to give the Celtics the lead, however, with two seconds remaining, Magic Johnson sank a \"junior sky hook\" to give the Lakers a 107–106 lead, then Bird missed a 20-foot jumper as time expired, allowing Los Angeles to gain a three games to one lead. In Game 5, the Celtics prevented the Lakers from celebrating in the Boston Garden by coming away with a 123–108 win. Boston guard Danny Ainge made 5 out of 6 three-pointers attempted, including a 45-footer as the first half expired. In Game 6, the Lakers trailed the Celtics 56–51 at halftime, but thanks to an 18–2 run, they regained control of the game with a 30–12 third quarter to cruise to a 106–93 victory and their fourth championship in the decade. Magic Johnson was named unanimous MVP of the series, averaging 26.2 points, 13.0 assists, 8.0 rebounds, and 2.3 steals, leading the Lakers in all four categories.\n\nThis was the first time the Celtics made the Finals since 1987, while the Lakers' last appearance had been in 2004. Boston was led by their 'Big Three' of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen. Los Angeles was led by MVP Kobe Bryant and All-Star Pau Gasol.\n\nThe Celtics' 66–16 record gave them home court advantage over Los Angeles (57–25). The Celtics won Game 1 98–88, highlighted by a dramatic comeback by Paul Pierce after a third quarter knee injury. In Game 2, the Celtics had a comfortable 24-point lead in the fourth quarter, before Kobe Bryant led a furious Lakers run that cut the lead to two. However the Celtics would hold on to win 108-102, taking the commanding 2–0 series lead.\n\nAs the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game 3, winning 87–81. They also looked to be in control of Game 4, holding their ground for most of the third quarter, leading by as many as 24 points. However, the Celtics went on a 21–3 run to end the third quarter, closing the deficit to only two points (73–71). With 4:07 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Celtics took their first lead in the game when Celtics' reserve Eddie House made an 18-foot (5.5 m) jumper. With House's shot, the Celtics were in the lead for good, winning 97–91. The Celtics' victory in Game 4 was the largest comeback in the NBA Finals since 1971.\n\nThe Lakers would win Game 5 103–98, despite blowing another large lead, and the series shifted back to Boston. However, the Celtics would close out the series in Game 6 with a dominant 131–92 win. The 39-point margin of victory was the largest ever in an NBA championship-clinching game, breaking the old record of 33, also set by the Celtics over the Lakers in Game Five of the 1965 NBA Finals, 129–96. Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.\n\nThis was the Celtics' 17th championship, their first since 1986, extending their record for most NBA championships won by a single team. Their win in Game 6 was also a sense of relief. Entering the game, they set a record of most playoff games played in one season, with 26, breaking the previous record of 25 set by both the 1994 New York Knicks, whom Celtics Coach Doc Rivers played for, and the 2005 Detroit Pistons, both of whom lost in their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in , Pistons in ). However, for the 1994 Knicks, the first round was a best-of-five. They also set an NBA record for most playoff games ever needed to win a championship, with 26, surpassing the previous record of 24 by the Lakers in 1988.\n\nThis was the third straight year in which the L.A. Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals. Much of both rosters had been kept intact since the teams last meeting in 2008 and the Celtics' veterans Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, and Rasheed Wallace looked to add to their championship résumés, while Kobe Bryant and the Lakers looked to even the score against the Celtics. The Lakers were the defending champions, having beaten the Orlando Magic 4–1 in the 2009 NBA Finals.\n\nThis was the first NBA Finals to go the full seven games since , and only the fourth since the NBA switched the Finals to a 2–3–2 format in .\n\nThe Lakers won Game 1 102–89, led by Kobe Bryant's 30-point performance. However, Ray Allen would respond in Game 2 by scoring 32-points and sinking a record eight 3-pointers, leading the Celtics to a 103–94 victory.\n\nGame 3 returned to Boston, where the Lakers took a 2–1 series lead by winning 91–84, again led by Bryant but with strong support from Derek Fisher. Game 4 would prove to be a close and hard-fought game, with the Lakers up by two at the end of the third quarter. However, Boston's bench would prove to be the deciding factor, outscoring the Lakers 13–2 for nearly half the quarter, en route to a 96–89 victory. The Celtics won the game and evened the series.\n\nDespite an impressive 38-point performance from Bryant in Game 5, the Celtics would win 92–86 led by Paul Pierce's 27 points, and would take a 3–2 lead heading back to L.A. However, the Lakers opened up a massive lead in Game 6, peaking at 27. The Lakers' bench had outscored Boston's bench 24–0 entering the fourth quarter. The Lakers would win the game 89–67 and set up an epic Game 7. Both Kendrick Perkins of Boston and Andrew Bynum of Los Angeles were injured in this game. However, while Perkins was ruled out because of his injury, Bynum was cleared to play in Game 7.\n\nThis was the fifth Game 7 between the Lakers and Celtics. Boston had won all previous Game 7 match-ups between the two teams. Kobe Bryant exhibited difficulties for much of the game, shooting only 6-for-24 from the field. However, he would score 10 of his game-high 24 points in the fourth quarter. After the Celtics had built a 13-point lead late in the third quarter, the game was tied at 64 with six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Ron Artest would sink a key 3-pointer for the Lakers and make other clutch moves, leading Phil Jackson to call him the MVP of Game 7. However, the Celtics would not give up, and Rajon Rondo would hit a 3-pointer to make the game 81–79. The Celtics were forced to foul Sasha Vujačić, he went to the line and made both free throws to give the Lakers a definitive 83–79 lead. Rondo would miss his final 3-pointer and the Lakers won Game 7 against the Celtics for the first time in franchise history, clinching their 16th NBA title.\n\nGame 7 was the second most-watched game in NBA history, with 28.2 million viewers (No. 1 being Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals). Game 7 was watched by an average audience of 1.1 million viewers on TSN, making it the largest Canadian audience ever recorded for an NBA game. This was also the first time since 2002 that a team has won back-to-back championships; that team was also the Lakers, led by Kobe and Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nKobe Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second straight year.\n\nOne of the lasting effects on the Lakers–Celtics rivalry was the usage of the famous \"Beat L.A.!\" chant, sung by fans in opposing arenas whenever a Los Angeles-based team plays in their home venue. The chant originated during Game 7 of the 1982 Eastern Conference Championships at Boston Garden when the Boston fans urged the victorious Philadelphia 76ers to \"Beat L.A.!\"\n\nIn January 2011 before an upcoming Celtic-Lakers regular season matchup, Celtic forward Kevin Garnett with shoe company Anta released a \"Beat L.A.\" green shoe which featured on the tongue the numbers \"152–120\", which was at the time the Celtics all-time record against the Lakers. The Celtics won the game, 109–96.\n\nThe following players have played for both the Celtics and the Lakers in their careers:\n\n\nThe following individuals have also played, coached and/or managed both the Celtics and Lakers in their careers:\n\n"}
{"id": "1931139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931139", "title": "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart", "text": "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\n\n\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her debut studio album, \"...Baby One More Time\" (1999). It was released on December 23, 1999 by Jive Records as the fifth and final single from the album. After Spears recorded an unused song from Toni Braxton and sent it through Larry Rudolph to several labels, executives from Jive Records commented that it was very rare to hear someone so young who could deliver emotional content and commercial appeal, appointing the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. The teen pop ballad was written and produced by White, and features Spears singing about the loss of a first love and how breaking up can be hard.\n\n\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, who noted the song as a classic hit and competent single, despite considering it unremarkable like other ballads on the album and calling it \"another rejection ballad that refers to kissing but nothing else\". \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" achieved moderate success, peaking at number 37 in Australia, and 23 in New Zealand. Through imports, the song managed to peak at number 174 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" reached number 14 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and 17 on Pop Songs, being later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 2000, for shipping 1,000,000 physical units of the single. It was the 8th best-selling physical single of the 2000s in the country.\n\nAn accompanying music video, directed by Gregory Dark from November 22–23, 1999, was released on December 17, 1999. It portrayed Spears packing her belongings as she readies herself to move away from home, and feeling upset because she knows that she is going to miss her first love. The video was the subject of controversy among the press, who panned the singer for hiring an adult filmmaker to direct her video. A Spears representative commented that they were only aware of Dark doing music videos. The singer performed \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" in a few live appearances, including at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, in a medley with \"...Baby One More Time\", and in three of her concert tours.\n\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense. Her mother Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\" Two weeks later, executives from JIVE Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that \"It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that.\" They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\" After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" was written by Eric Foster White, for Spears' debut studio album, \"...Baby One More Time\" (1999). Spears recorded the vocals for the song in 1997 at 4MW East Studios in New Jersey and at Battery Studios in New York City, New York. Dan Petty played the guitar, while the bass guitar was done by Andy Hess. The song was later mixed by White and Chris Trevett, while background vocals were provided by Spears, Angie Simmons, Don Philip and Andrew Fromm. It was released on December 15, 1999 as the final single from \"...Baby One More Time\".\n\n\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" was produced by Eric Foster White. Described by Spears as a \"soulful\" ballad, it draws influence from teen pop and lasts for five minutes and ten seconds. Chuck Taylor of \"Billboard\" noted that the singer \"turn toward the sad side\" on the track, with its lyrics talking about the loss of a first love and how breaking up can be hard. As the song begins, Spears declares, \"'Never look back', we said / How was I to know I'd miss you so? / Loneliness up ahead, emptyness behind / Where do I go?\" During the chorus, she realizes that she has lost her true love, stating, \"From the bottom of my broken heart, even though time may find me somebody new / You were my real love, I never knew love, till there was you.\" According to sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" is composed in the key of G major and is set in time signature of common time with a slowly tempo of 76 beats per minute.\n\nThe single's b-side, \"Thinkin' About You\", is also a teen pop influenced song. The song is composed in the key of G major and is set in time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. Spears vocal range spans over two octaves from the low note of G to the high note D Craig McDennis of \"The Hamilton Spectator\" said the lyrics of \"Thinkin' About You\", along with \"Born to Make You Happy\", \"verge on the sort of boy-worshipping dreck that even Tiffany would have sniffedat\", while Jane Stevenson of \"Toronto Sun\" noted Spears \"puts some rather grownup heartfelt soul into [it]\".\n\n\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic considered the song a competent, but unremarkable single. Kyle Anderson of MTV criticized its lyrics, deeming it as \"another rejection ballad that references kissing but nothing else\". Caryn Ganz of \"Rolling Stone\" called \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" a \"further hit\" from \"...Baby One More Time\", along with \"Sometimes\" and \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\". The song was a Track Pick from the AllMusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who praised it along with the other singles from the album, saying, \"\"...Baby One More Time\" has its share of well-crafted filler, but the singles, combined with Britney's burgeoning charisma, make this a pretty great piece of fluff\". Author David Gauntlett considered its lyrics as \"slushy\", and noticed that the track was \"seen as less interesting and relevant [by the fans], although [they] clearly enjoyed [the song] too\". \"Billboard\" critic Chuck Taylor praised the song, and did a further review on his column:\n\n\"'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart' possesses a breezy air that is certain to continue her breakneck success on the singles charts. Eric Forster White is at the helm this time, writing and producing a song that will easily appeal to Miss Spears' young core, with the potential to chart the more mature AC audience, too. [...] Spears' star is shining brighter than ever, and this wholesome track will only serve to illuminate it all the more. An ace\".\n\nAlso from \"Billboard\", Chuck Arnold wrote that \"there’s just not enough depth or texture to her voice, but the little quiver in her chirp does serve her well on the final single from the album, a weepie one about losing your first love\". The staff from \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed it at number 135 on their ranking of Spears's songs. \"Bustle\"s Alex Kristelis said that \"I can roll with cheesy, but ['From the Bottom of My Broken Heart'] is just too much!\". Nicholas Hautman, from \"Us Weekly\", was more positive and opined that \"this teenybopper torch song is no 'Sometimes', but it’s a classic in Spears’ catalog that some fans unfairly push to the side\".\n\nOn the chart issue dated February 19, 2000, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" was at number 52 on United States' \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The following issue, the song peaked at number 14, after selling 78,000 physical units of the single, and became the Greatest Gainer/Sales title of that week. The song also went from number 73 to number 3 on the Hot Singles Sales chart, before peaking at number 1 on the chart issue dated March 4, 2000. \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" also appeared on several \"Billboard\" component charts, peaking at number 24 on Top 40 Tracks, number 17 on Pop Songs, and number 53 on Radio Songs. On March 28, 2000, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipping 1,000,000 physical units of the single in the country. By the end of 2000, the song peaked at number 77 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Year-End chart. \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" was the 8th best selling physical single of the 2000s, according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of June 2012, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" has sold 778,000 physical singles, with 33,000 paid digital downloads in the United States. It is Spears' second best-selling physical single in the country. In Australia, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" entered the ARIA chart at number 47, before peaking at number 37 on the following issue. The song stayed a total of five weeks on the chart. It performed better in New Zealand, where it peaked at number 23. Through imports, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" did manage to peak at number 174 in the United Kingdom, while in Canada, after staying for five weeks on the \"RPM\" Singles Chart, the song peaked at number 25 on the dated week of February 28, 2000.\n\nJive Records commissioned a music video for the song to be directed by Gregory Dark. According to Dark, the label hired him with the intention of re-image Spears from the naughty schoolgirl persona of \"...Baby One More Time\", and stated that they \"wanted a much more story-oriented video without dance, one that was serious and emotional.\" He further stated that, during the filming, \"I'd joke with her so that she would loosen up and feel comfortable acting, as opposed to being Britney Spears at that moment.\" The video was produced by the FM Rocks Production Company.\n\nThe music video portrays Spears packing up her belongings, as she readies herself to move away from home, and feeling upset because she knows that she is going to miss her first love. Throughout the video, scenes of the couple's past are also seen and Spears is sitting on a tire swing, including one where they climb up onto a windmill, with Spears singing the song, and Spears is standing by a billboard that reads \"Welcome to Cedar Springs Gardens\" similar to the video \"Lucky\". Before the end of the video, Spears is waiting at a bus stop while, at the same time, her first love is driving to come see her one last time. However, by the time he finally gets there, Spears had left him behind and taken the bus.\n\nAccording to writer Linda Ruth Williams, the music video attracted attention from the press because of \"the clash between Spears' wholesome image and Dark's unwholesome back catalogue.\" A Spears representative spoke to the \"Sunday Sport\" and revealed, \"as far as I'm aware the director just does music videos. This is a video for young teenage girls and not sexy at all.\" Dark responded to the negative reviews saying, \"I don't deny that I did [adult films], it's just that I also like people to know that I don't currently and haven't in a long time.\" \"Billboard\" reporter Carla Hay also noted, \"I don't think people who buy records are too concerned about the background of the video's director.\" Lucy O'Brien, author of \"She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul\", noted that hiring Dark as the video director implied that Spears was not that innocent. \"Time\" journalists Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce said that Spears \"may be the queen of pop tartiness, but her new video, 'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart', is an entirely wholesome affair,\" while Chris Ryan of MTV considered it \"a suitably soft-focus affair\". The video was also added to MTV's 2000 Yearbook, a list with the \"biggest, best, most memorable music videos of every year since the beginning of MTV.\"\n\nAlec Hanley Bemis of \"LA Weekly\" highly criticized Spears and the music video. He thought that the singer's \"lack of musical talent\" had begun to affect her career, after Dark was selected as the director of the video. Bemis commented, however, that Spears' already had \"a history of questionable decisions\", and cited her \"Rolling Stone\" photoshoot done in early 1999, which was condemned by the American Family Association, as an example. He continued to state that the plotline set the singer \"on the fast track to adulthood\" and questioned, \"who's in bed with Britney now? While a TV tabloid recently reported that an old bayou beau in Louisiana has mother Spears’ approval, fantasizing fans want to believe Britney‘s dallying with that braided moppet from N’Sync or a member of the Backstreet Boys. But the only verifiable fact we have to work with is that Spears has started running with a darker L.A. crowd.\" Bemis finished his review saying that \"no avant-garde film techniques [were used on it]. But Britney's lips glisten so... Speaking frankly, this light in our lives hurts us, from the fire in our loins to the bottom of our broken hearts.\"\n\n\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" was performed for the first time on the ...Baby One More Time Tour in Pompano Beach, Florida, U.S.A at June 28, 1999. After its release as a single, Spears performed the song in a medley with \"...Baby One More Time\" at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards. Spears was wearing a turtleneck and a full tulle skirt at the beginning of the performance, while dancers surrounded her with enormous hand fans. After singing a shortened version of the song, she then took a few moments to shuffle into a form-fitting red rhinestone outfit (with side cutouts) and emerged onto a stage to perform \"...Baby One More Time.\" Jocelyn Vena of MTV included the performance on her list of Spears' Top 10 Best TV Performances. Spears also performed the song on her 2000s Crazy 2k Tour, where her dancers picked a boy from the audience and invited him onstage, while Spears dedicated the performance of \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" to the boy. The same year, the song was performed for the last time on Oops!... I Did It Again Tour. Wearing glittery jeans and an orange halter top, she performed an acoustic version of the song with her guitarist Skip. Spears also performed \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" and \"Born to Make You Happy\" on \"Disney Channel in Concert\" in 1999. The performances were recorded and included on Spears' first home video release, \"Time Out with Britney Spears\". The song was also performed in the television program \"Good Morning America\" on January 7, 2000 along with \"...Baby One More Time\".\n\n\n\nCredits for \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" are adapted from \"...Baby One More Time\"'s liner notes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1931141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931141", "title": "Radnor Forest", "text": "Radnor Forest\n\nRadnor Forest () is a rock dome composed of Silurian shales, mudstones and limestone in Mid Wales, and a forest only in the medieval sense of an unenclosed area used for hunting. It lies within the Welsh Marches region since Offa's Dyke lies nearby to the east.\nThe area lies to the north of the Black Mountains, Wales and to the east of the Cambrian mountains. Hergest Ridge is immediately to the south-east of the area, near the small town of Kington. The highest point in the area is Rhos Fawr or Great Rhos, a broad featureless plateau which reaches , and is equipped with a trig point to mark the summit. A similar plateau adjoining to the east, Black Mixen is the only Nuttall to have a communications mast (a radio transmitter) on its summit.\n\nThere is a famous waterfall or cascade on the eastern side of the mountain, called Water Break-its-neck. It can be reached via a short rough track or forestry road from the A44 main road from Kington to Aberystwyth, shortly after New Radnor, and there is a small car park for visitors to the Warren Wood reserve maintained by the Forestry Commission. The cascade can be reached after a short walk along a well built walkway beside the river in the hanging valley. There are two other small car parks around the edge of the forest to the north and the east which allow public access to the moorland and woods. There is also a large Forestry Commission plantation to the north-west of the main peaks.\n\nPart of the area is a designated and protected SSSI, with rare saxifrage and other plants. It covers the highest peaks and a rocky gorge near the centre.\n\nThe vegetation of the summit ridges is fairly uniform, and is dominated by a mixture of dwarf \nshrubs, heather , crowberry, and bilberry . Mixed with these dwarf shrubs are hare's-tail cottongrass, purple moor-grass , sedges such as Carex binervis and a number of mosses and lichens. The dwarf shrubs are very well grown and suggest the area has suffered little from fires in the recent past and that grazing pressures are light. Purple moor-grass is \nbut thinly scattered and does not form the extensive stands so familiar only a few miles west. Peat pools support common cottongrass Eriophorum angustifolium.\n\nThe steep-sided dingles and rock outcrops of the Forest's edge support rich plant communities, \nsince these eastern Silurian shales are slightly calcareous. Mossy saxifrage\nand rock stonecrop are common on some cliff faces, with marjoram and a number of interesting mosses and liverworts.\n\nA variety of typical upland breeding birds are present, including raptors such as the red kite and common buzzard, as well as red grouse, whinchat, stonechat, wheatear and the dipper at or near the many streams in the forest.\n\nThe topmost parts of the forest exhibit several Bronze Age round barrows, and there are also several ring cairns in the area. Most occur on or near the peaks, such as Black Mixen and Bache Hill. Prehistoric settlement is shown by hut circles often present as distinctive platforms. The forest was exploited as a military training area in the last war, and has remnants of such activity such as bomb craters and slit trenches. Part of the site is still used for testing ammunition and ordnance; there are warning flags and signs at the boundaries of the Harley valley range. It includes a distinctive landscape feature known as \"The Three Wriggles\", a set of three gulleys running down the mountain slope on the western side of the Harley valley. There is also some evidence for mining activity.\n\nThe town of New Radnor was a planned Norman settlement, and there is a large mound just to the north of the town marking the site of a motte and bailey castle.\n\nAccording to a legend, the local people built four churches in a circle around the Radnor Forest in order to contain the last dragon in Wales, who lay sleeping in the area. The churches, at Llanfihangel Cefnllys, Llanfihangel Rhydithon (Dolau), Llanfihangel Nant Melan and Llanfihangel Cascob, were all dedicated to St Michael (Welsh: Mihangel) victor over the dragon. Some people believed that the dragon would awaken if any of the four churches were destroyed.\n\nThere are several small market towns at the feet of the hills, including the county town of Powys, Llandrindod Wells, Kington, Herefordshire, Knighton, Powys and Presteigne. The latter town is in Powys and was formerly the county town of Radnorshire. The village of New Radnor sits at the southern base of the hills, and there are several other villages nearby, such as Old Radnor, Gladestry and Cascob.\n\n"}
{"id": "1931147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931147", "title": "Linda Montano", "text": "Linda Montano\n\nLinda Mary Montano (born January 18, 1942, Saugerties, New York) is an American performance artist.\n\nMontano was raised in a devoutly Roman Catholic household, partly Irish and partly Italian, surrounded by artistic activity. Both her parents played in an orchestra but Linda's fascination with Catholic ritual and desire to do humanitarian service led her to join the novitiate of the Maryknoll Sisters after one year studying at the College of New Rochelle. After two years with the order, however, Montano was suffering from severe anorexia, and she left to return to her former college, from which she graduated in 1965 as a sculptor.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1960s, Montano continued to study and began performing, and by 1971 she was devoting herself exclusively to performance art. Around this time she married the photographer Mitchell Payne. During this period, Montano drifted away from the Catholic Church, but despite this loss of faith, she consistently acknowledged the influence of her strict Catholic upbringing on her work - for instance in how the discipline of convent life and her family's loyal work-ethic made her able to carry out extremely disciplined performances in her later career. Montano's first major performance, \"Chicken Woman\" (1972) was based on her MFA sculpture show at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. There she exhibited nine live chickens in three by minimalist chicken wire cages on the roof of the art building. It was titled \"The Chicken Show\" from 1969.\n\nMontano moved to San Francisco 1970 with her husband. There she established herself with performances like \"Handcuff\" (1973 with Tom Marioni) where she was physically tied to other artists, and \"Three Day Blindfold\" (1974), where she lived for three days blindfolded and had to find her way around. The death of her husband led to further exploration of art as a healing modality (\"Mitchells' Death\", 1978) and she continued her art-theology dialogue by living in a Zen monastery for three years and to Ananda Ashram in the 1980s where she studied with Dr. Ramamurti Mishra for over 30 years. His influence and appreciation of her vision encouraged both her art and life. Upon meeting Taiwanese performance artist Tehching Hsieh, they performed a collaboration whereby the two artists were bound to each other by a length of rope 24 hours a day for a whole year (from July 4, 1983 to July 3, 1984). During the late 1980s Montano began teaching \"Sacred Sex\" workshops with Annie Sprinkle and Barbara Carrellas with whom she also created \"MetamorphoSex\" (later changed to \"The Art of Love\" at Montano's suggestion), a \"workshop, sex magic ritual and theatre performance rolled into one\" which was first performed in Texas in 1995.\n\nMontano's work investigates the relationship between art and life through intricate, life-altering ceremonies, some of which last for seven or more years. She is interested in the way artistic ritual, often staged as individual interactions or collaborative workshops, can be used to alter and enhance a person's life and to create the opportunity for focus on spiritual energy states, silence and the cessation of art/life boundaries.\n\nFrom 1984 onwards Montano did another ambitious project titled \"Seven Years of Living Art\", in which she lived in her home in Kingston wearing strictly monochromatic clothing, spent a portion of every day in a coloured room, and listened to a designated tone, all of which corresponded to the energetic qualities of a specific chakra. She changed color every year, and after the project was finished followed it up with \"Another Seven Years of Living Art\", in part to memorialise her mother, Mildred Montano, who died in 1988 of colon cancer. This time she did not use the colours, but aimed to focus on the same chakras. From 1998, Montano has given cycles to other artists: MIchelle Bush, Barbara Carrellas, SC Durkin, Koosil-Ja Hwang, Vernita N'Cognita, Esther K. Smith, Krista Kelly Walsh, with satellite projects by Victoria Singh & Kurtis Champion, Steven Reigns and Elizabeth Stephens & Annie Sprinkle hoping to give three cycles to three artists, each dating up to 2019. After this, Montano focused upon freelance teaching of performance art, caring for Henry Montano (her increasingly ill father) and counseling people again practicing \"Art/Life Counseling\", a technique she used for seven years at The New Museum where curator Marcia Tucker had built a private room and allowed Montano to counsel people once a month in the window installation which was painted the same color that Montano wore for that year. At that time (1984–1991) Montano used tarot, palm and psychic readings as tools of discovery, as well as attentive listening so that she could respond to the questions of her clients with the intention of finding the most creative ways to respond to their problems and difficulties. (Montano still practices \"Art/Life/Laugher Counseling\" but without the assistance of tarot, palm and psychic readings; they are forbidden by her current practice of Catholicism).\n\nFounded by Montano herself, the Art/Life Institute offers residency to aspiring performance artists in Kingston for Performance Artists, where Montano worked on and performed her works. She also wrote \"The Art/Life Institute Handbook\", which included performance exercises that drew from her own work as well as that of others. The handbook was intended to make performance art a tool accessible to anyone. Montano's work has questioned the boundaries between life and art, and the institute and the artist's other Art/Life counseling perpetrated the dissolution of these boundaries by attempting to bring performance to all people and all aspects of life. For those not able to complete a residency at the institute, Montano even has a \"Virtual Residency\" available online with tasks that similarly designed to make performance more natural and accessible to anyone.\n\nThe influence of her father led Montano to return to Catholicism and ultimately to church attendance. Since 2005 she has gathered and taken prayer requests to more than ten Catholic pilgrimage sites throughout the world. Montano also meets with others in Catholic churches for 3 hours silent retreats, re-seeing the concept of endurance from new Catholic eyes. Since returning, Montano has made numerous videos exploring the faith, including \"Father Lebar: Catholic Priest and Exorcist\"; Saint Teresa Of Avila By Linda Mary Montano, and currently \"Mother Teresa of Calcutta\". She also performs three-hour endurances, lip-syncing as Paul McMahon and Bob Dylan.\n\nMontano donated her archive to the Fales Library and Special Collections at NYU in 2013.\n\nIn 1975 Montano met Pauline Oliveros, who eventually became her romantic partner. The titles of Oliveros' pieces \"Rose Moon\" and \"Rose Mountain\" refer to Montano having gone by Rose Mountain at one time.\n\n\n\n"}

The name \"Deva\" comes from the original Roman name for the fort Deva Victrix, which became the city of Chester.\n\nThe Deva Stadium opened in 1992, two years after the closure of Chester City's Sealand Road stadium; in the intervening two seasons the club had played at Macclesfield Town's Moss Rose stadium.\n\nWhen a new owner took over Chester City in March 1990, plans were announced to sell its Sealand Road stadium for redevelopment as a supermarket and build a new stadium at nearby Bumpers Lane. While the new stadium was being built they played at Moss Rose stadium in Macclesfield, 45 miles to the east. Sealand Road closed at the end of the 1989–90 season, and Chester played at Macclesfield for the following two seasons.\n\nConstruction of the new stadium began in January 1992 and it opened seven months later in time for the 1992–93 season.\n\nIt was the first English football stadium to fulfil the safety recommendations from the Taylor Report, which was commissioned after the Bradford Fire of 1985 and after the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. Walsall's Bescot Stadium had opened in August 1990, seven months after the report was published, but construction had started before the end of 1989.\n\nThe stadium was officially opened on 24 August 1992 by Conservative Party peer Morys Bruce, 4th Baron Aberdare.\n\nThe stadium hosted its first game the next day, when Chester lost 2–1 in the League Cup to Stockport County. 11 days later, Chester beat Burnley 3–0 in the first Football League match on the ground. On 13 October 1992, Chester beat a Manchester United XI 2–0. Its tenth anniversary in August 2002 was celebrated with a special friendly against a Liverpool XI, with Chester winning 1–0.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007 it was officially known as the Saunders Honda Stadium for sponsorship purposes, before reverting to the Deva Stadium for the 2007–08 season.\n\nOn 2 May 2008 it was announced that as of the 2008–09 season, the Deva would be known as The Cestrian Trading stadium.\n\nIn February 2010, The New Saints of the Welsh Premier League formally applied for a groundshare with Chester City, who had lost their league status the previous year and were by now deep in debt and on the verge of closure, at the Deva Stadium. However, TNS ultimately decided to remain at Park Hall in Oswestry.\n\nChester City were dissolved with huge debts on 10 March 2010, two days after being expelled from the Conference Premier (to which they had been relegated from The Football League the previous season), and as a result the stadium was left without a tenant. In May 2010 the owners of the ground, Chester and Cheshire West council awarded the lease to the newly formed phoenix club Chester F.C.\n\nThe first Chester F.C. match at the stadium was a 3–0 victory over Aberystwyth Town in a friendly on 24 July 2010.\n\nThe stadium is located on the Sealand Road Industrial Estate, and lies on the border between England and Wales; the border runs along the rear of the east stand (the main stand) with the pitch itself located over the border in Flintshire. However, the ground's address is officially classed as being in England due to the location of the club's offices.\n\nThe stadium initially had a capacity of 6,000 before the away end was converted to seating, and now holds 5,400.\n\nThe Deva Stadium has three sides of seating and one terraced end. The largest stand, known as the Red Insure (main) Stand, and The Harry McNally Terrace are both for home fans. The West Stand is mostly for home fans, but has a small section for away fans and the South Stand is exclusively for away fans. In summer 2007, Chester converted the South Stand from terracing to seating (as mentioned above). There have been few other changes of significance in the 15-year history of the Deva Stadium, although the North Terrace was renamed the Harry McNally Terrace in December 2006 in honour of one of its most popular managers (who died two years earlier). In 2010, the main stand was renamed the Exacta Stand.\n"}
{"id": "1931164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931164", "title": "Arapaho National Forest", "text": "Arapaho National Forest\n\nArapaho National Forest is a National Forest located in north-central Colorado, United States. The facility is managed jointly with the Roosevelt National Forest and the Pawnee National Grassland from the United States Forest Service office in Fort Collins, Colorado. It has a wildlife refuge which manages a protection for all birds and mammals. The combined facility of 1,730,603 acres (2,704.07 sq mi, or 7,420.35 km²) is denoted as ARP (Arapaho, Roosevelt, Pawnee) by the Forest Service. Separately, Arapaho National Forest consists of 723,744 acres (1,130.85 sq mi, or 2,928.89 km²).\n\nThe forest is located in the Rocky Mountains, straddling the continental divide in the Front Range west of Denver. It was established on July 1, 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt and named for the Arapaho tribe of Native Americans which previously inhabited the Colorado Eastern Plains. The forest includes part of the high Rockies and river valleys in the upper watershed of the Colorado River and South Platte River. The forest is largely in Grand and Clear Creek counties, but spills over into neighboring (in descending order of land area) Gilpin, Park, Routt, Jackson, and Jefferson counties. There are local ranger district offices located in Granby and Idaho Springs.\n\nThe ponds also produce many insects and other invertebrates (protein) needed by most female waterfowl for successful egg laying. These insects also serve as an essential food item for the growth of ducklings and goslings during the summer months.\n\nThe first waterfowl arrive in the spring when the ice vanishes in April. The peak migration occurs in late May when 5,000 or more ducks may be present. Canada geese have been reestablished in North Park and begin nesting during April. Duck nesting usually starts in early June and peaks in late June. The forest produces about 9,000 ducklings and 150 to 200 goslings each year. The Fish and Wildlife Service expects that when refuge lands are fully acquired and developed, waterfowl production should increase significantly.\n\nThere have been 198 bird species recorded in the forest. Primary upland nesting species include the mallard, pintail, gadwall, and American wigeon. A number of diving ducks, including the lesser scaup and redhead, nest on the larger ponds and adjacent wet meadows. Most species may be observed during the entire summer season. Fall migration reaches its height in late September or early October when up to 8,000 waterfowl may be present.\n\nThe wetlands also attract numerous marsh, shore, and water birds. Sora and Virginia rails are numerous but seldom seen. If they are present, Wilson's phalarope, American avocet, willet, sandpipers, Greater yellowlegs, and dowitchers will be easy to observe. Other less common species include great blue heron, black-crowned night heron, American bittern, and eared and pied-billed grebe.\n\nThe upland hills harbor sage grouse year around with a winter population of more than 200 birds. Golden eagles, several species of hawks, and an occasional prairie falcon circle the skies above in search of food. Their prey includes Richardson's ground squirrel, white-tailed prairie dog, and white-tailed jackrabbit.\n\nBadger, muskrat, beaver, coyote, and pronghorn are commonly observed. It is also possible to see a raccoon, red fox, mink, long-tailed weasel, or porcupine. As many as 400 mule deer have wintered here and up to 200 elk are frequently seen during the winter months. Moose have recently been reintroduced into North Park and may occasionally be observed in the willow thickets along the Illinois River bottoms.

This application of computer vision techniques is used in image retrieval systems to organize and locate images of interest from a database.\n\nThis method can be regarded as a type of multi-class image classification with a very large number of classes - as large as the vocabulary size. Typically, image analysis in the form of extracted feature vectors and the training annotation words are used by machine learning techniques to attempt to automatically apply annotations to new images. The first methods learned the correlations between image features and training annotations, then techniques were developed using machine translation to try to translate the textual vocabulary with the 'visual vocabulary', or clustered regions known as \"blobs\". Work following these efforts have included classification approaches, relevance models and so on.\n\nThe advantages of automatic image annotation versus content-based image retrieval (CBIR) are that queries can be more naturally specified by the user. CBIR generally (at present) requires users to search by image concepts such as color and texture, or finding example queries. Certain image features in example images may override the concept that the user is really focusing on. The traditional methods of image retrieval such as those used by libraries have relied on manually annotated images, which is expensive and time-consuming, especially given the large and constantly growing image databases in existence.\n\nSome annotation engines are online, including the ALIPR.com real-time tagging engine developed by Pennsylvania State University researchers, and Behold. Companies such as Canotic.com, Playment, Edgecase.ai, Microsoft VOTT.ai and dataloop.ai have all built automatic engines for video annotation. Additional companies such as Alegion.com, Infolks, DataPure.co, Scaleapi.com, Diffgram.com, Figure-eight.com offer a mix of automatic image annotation with a mix of manual overview when automation fails.\n\n\n\nSimultaneous Image Classification and Annotation\n\n\n\n\n"}

After the defeat of the Master, alone and displaced, they seek a new homeland but have no real destination and very little food.\n\nIra Hath, descendant of Ira Manth, and a great prophetess who is also Kestrel and Bowman's mother, has a vision of the Manth people's true homeland. Throughout the book the Manth people travel with only Ira's guidance, and she becomes weaker as they go, knowing she will eventually die of prophecy.\n\nBowman eagerly awaits a summons from Sirene, and must prepare to sacrifice himself to save his people and the world. Before he is ready for this, however, he must be trained by the great Albard, the Master of the ruined Mastery. The journey is long, and his preparation is tough, especially in the hands of a strange teacher. Jumper, the man-woman Singer who can change forms and personalities to please people, has come for Bowman. Jumper agrees to let Kestrel, Bowman's sister, come along as well.\n\nIn the end it is revealed that Kestrel is the one who is destined to give her life, having picked up Albard's teachings along the way. Bowman is in fact the \"Meeting place\"- the point at which the great evil and the great kindness of the world will annihilate one another. This is because he was once one of the Zars, the army of the Morah (the \"spirit\" of all evil), and is one of the Singer people too, as he has been trained in their ways. Upon reaching the homeland, Ira's life ends, her destiny fulfilled. Kestrel, too, ends her life with all the other Singers, singing the firesong to destroy the Morah, give humanity a fresh start, and allow the Manth people to finally reach the homeland.\n\nThe epilogue, set some 8 years later, finds the Manth people established in their new home, with various people married and with young families. Amongst them are Bowman and Sisi (the princess of Gang, and Kestrel's best friend), who are now rulers of Gang due to Sisi's birthright.

{"id": "1931195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931195", "title": "Stan Hansen", "text": "Stan Hansen\n\nJohn Stanley Hansen II (born August 29, 1949) is an American retired professional wrestler.\n\nHansen is known for his stiff wrestling style, which he attributes to his poor eyesight. He is also known for his gimmick as a loud, violent cowboy who wanted to fight everybody, which he further emphasized by appearing in interviews with a cowboy hat, leather vest and bullrope while often chewing on tobacco. Considered the most successful and popular gaijin in Japanese professional wrestling history, he became more well-known and revered in Japan than in his native United States. In Japan's AJPW promotion, he held seven different championships.\n\nIn 1989, he played a small role in the movie \"No Holds Barred\" and in 2011, released his co-written biography, \"The Last Outlaw\".\n\nHansen played college football for the West Texas State Buffaloes.\n\nHansen made his professional wrestling debut in 1973. Initially a part-time job while playing football for the Detroit Wheels, he began wrestling full-time when the team folded. In 1975, Hansen first teamed with future partner Frank Goodish, who later adopted the ring name Bruiser Brody, while competing in Leroy McGuirk's Tri-State territory.\n\nIn 1976, Hansen made his debut for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) and only two months after he began competing for the company, he began feuding with the WWF Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino over the title. During a title match, Hansen broke Sammartino's neck while they were wrestling and it was from this incident that both Hansen and promoters claimed that Sammartino's injury came about from the enormous power of his lariat. However, a botched powerslam is what actually caused Sammartino's injury. After Sammartino recovered, Hansen faced him for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship once again, but was unsuccessful. He left the promotion soon after. He returned in 1980, rekindling his feud with Sammartino and facing Pedro Morales and Andre the Giant on several occasions. He also developed a heated feud with then-WWF Champion Bob Backlund which culminated in a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden.\n\nHansen first came to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in January 1977 through the booking of Vince McMahon Sr. With his \"reputation\" as the man who broke Bruno Sammartino's neck, Hansen quickly became a top heel, facing Antonio Inoki and other top New Japan stars like Seiji Sakaguchi and Tatsumi Fujinami. In addition, while touring Japan regularly, he faced top American wrestlers including Andre the Giant, Dusty Rhodes, Bob Backlund, and Hulk Hogan. Hansen established himself as a dominant force in Japan by competing in New Japan's MSG (Madison Square Garden) tournament between 1978 and 1981. Hansen would win the NWF World Title from Antonio Inoki on February 8, 1980, one of the only two wrestlers to dethrone Inoki during his seven-year reign. From November 21 to December 13, 1980, Hansen did a tour for NJPW, where he competed in the first MSG Tag League tournament (later renamed the G1 Tag League). He teamed with Hulk Hogan, but they failed to win. He returned that April to wrestle Antonio Inoki in an unsuccessful match. However, he defeated Hansen via countout in a MSG League match in May 20, 1981 after hitting a lariat on Inoki, knocking him off the apron. He returned for several more one off shows until leaving the promotion in December 1981.\n\nHansen returned at NJPW's Super Fight In Tokyo Dome event in 1990, where he had an infamous interpromotional match against Vader. The match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship saw Big Van Vader (representing New Japan, while Hansen represented All Japan) get struck in the eye during the entrances by Hansen's Bullrope. Both men were known to use a stiff style of wrestling, resulting in a nasty exchange where each man threw legitimate punches. The match ended in a draw. He returned in June for a few more matches, teaming twice with Riki Choshu and once with The Pegasus Kid.\n\nIn 1981, Hansen abruptly left NJPW to join All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). While in AJPW, Hansen became the only man to pin Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba in championship singles matches. He continued wrestling from 1982 to 1999 in World's Strongest Tag Determination League. He wrestled primarily in tag matches, where he formed many teams with the likes of Bruiser Brody, Terry Gordy, Ted DiBiase, Genichiro Tenryu, Dan Spivey, Bobby Duncum Jr., and Big Van Vader. Hansen also engaged in a renowned brawl with André the Giant in Japan.\n\nIn addition to championship matches, Hansen also competed in other high-profile matches. At the NJPW Super Fight in Tokyo Dome show on February 2, 1990, Hansen competed in another notable match as he represented AJPW against NJPW representative Big Van Vader. This particular match became renowned for its stiffness, as Hansen and Vader repeatedly exchanged blows until Hansen unintentionally poked Vader's right eye with his thumb, which caused the eye to pop out of its socket. After removing his mask, pushing the eye back into its socket and holding it in place with his eyelid, Vader continued wrestling Hansen until the match was rendered a no contest. As a result of the injury, Vader required a metal plate to be surgically placed under his eye. On April 13, 1990, the World Wrestling Federation and AJPW held a supershow called Wrestling Summit at the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, in which Hansen lost to Hulk Hogan in the main event. Hansen won his first Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship by defeating Terry Gordy on June 8, 1990, and wrestled a rematch in NJPW against Vader on June 12.\n\nHansen competed in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) from 1985 to 1986. He won the World Heavyweight Championship on December 29, 1985, from Rick Martel. On June 29, 1986, he no-showed a title defense against the number one contender Nick Bockwinkel due to disagreements with management, forcing the AWA to default the title to Bockwinkel. Rumors suggest that Hansen was actually in the building that evening and had been informed by AWA promoter Verne Gagne of the pending loss to Bockwinkel. Hansen allegedly called All Japan Pro Wrestling president Giant Baba to ask if losing the championship was acceptable, but Baba had already lined up challengers for Hansen and did not permit Hansen to drop the championship. In the end, Hansen refused to drop the title to Bockwinkel and was stripped of the championship; Bockwinkel was given one of the tag team belts, which was then billed as the AWA World Heavyweight Championship due to Hansen still possessing the true title belt. Hansen immediately returned to Japan and defended the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, despite being stripped of it. The AWA threatened legal action if Hansen continued to carry the belt and refer to himself as the organization's champion, so Hansen responded by running over the belt with his truck and mailing it back with the mud tracks still on it. This chain of events was reviewed in an interview with Hansen at an NWA Legends convention, in which he expressed regret over the way he handled the situation and ultimately complimented Gagne.\n\nIn late 1990, Hansen began appearing in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), feuding with Lex Luger over the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. On October 27 at Halloween Havoc, Hansen defeated Luger to win the title, ending Luger's record-setting reign at 523 days. On December 16 at Starrcade, Hansen lost the title back to Luger in a bullrope match. During this period, Hansen continued working tours for All Japan, teaming with Dan Spivey to finish second in the World's Strongest Tag Determination League in November and December. Hansen wrestled another rematch with Vader at the WrestleWar pay-per-view in February 1991. On April 18, Hansen and Spivey won the AJPW World Tag Team Championship from Terry Gordy and Steve Williams, and teamed occasionally upon their return to WCW. In June, Hansen left WCW and returned full-time to All Japan after a disagreement over an idea to group him with The Desperados, a trio of bumbling cowboys looking for Hansen through a series of vignettes. His last WCW match occurred on June 23 in Atlanta. As a result of his departure, The Desperados' angle was dropped and the trio was quickly dissolved.\n\nUpon his return to AJPW, Hansen began a major feud with Mitsuharu Misawa, during which time they traded the Triple Crown Championship between one another. Following Giant Baba's death, Misawa became the new booker and quickly began de-emphasizing Hansen and other foreign talent, in favor of new native recruits such as Takao Omori and Yoshihiro Takayama.\n\nIn 2000, and formed Pro Wrestling Noah (NOAH), although Hansen chose to remain loyal to AJPW instead of joining the talent exodus. Despite remaining with AJPW, Hansen's ongoing lumbago at the time began to worsen, which ultimately lead him to wrestle his final singles match on October 21, 2000 as part of a tournament for the vacant Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. Hansen lost the semi-final match to old partner Genichiro Tenryu, who went on to win the tournament and the title. His last match altogether was a six-man bout on the 28th, in which he, Steve Williams and Wolf Hawkfield lost to Johnny Smith, Yoshiaki Fujiwara and Masanobu Fuchi.\n\nHansen announced his retirement on January 28, 2001 during the Giant Baba Memorial Spectacular event.\n\nSoon after retiring, Hansen successfully underwent surgery on his back and knees, the latter of which were both replaced. After recovering, he became the commissioner of AJPW's Pacific Wrestling Federation championship governing body, which saw him appear during Triple Crown and World Tag Team Championship matches to issue proclamations of the matches. In July 2007, Hansen voluntarily resigned from the position, with Hiroshi Hase replacing him.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, Hansen was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by his rival and friend Vader.\n\nIn 1989, Hansen had a small role in the World Wrestling Federation-produced movie \"No Holds Barred\", which starred Hulk Hogan.\n\nHansen has four children. He has an eldest son, John Stanley Hansen III and daughter, Elizabeth Paige Hardee, née Hansen, from his first marriage. He had two more children with his current wife Yumi, Shaver (born December 19, 1987), played baseball at Baylor University before being drafted by the Seattle Mariners as the second pick in the sixth round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. His younger son, Samuel (born February 21, 1991), is also a baseball player and played for the University of Texas at Arlington.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1931224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931224", "title": "Rebecca Horn", "text": "Rebecca Horn\n\nRebecca Horn (born 24 March 1944, Michelstadt, Hesse) is a German visual artist, who is best known for her installation art, film directing, and her body modifications such as \"Einhorn\" (Unicorn), a body-suit with a very large horn projecting vertically from the headpiece. She directed the films \"Der Eintänzer\" (1978), \"La ferdinanda: Sonate für eine Medici-Villa\" (1982) and \"Buster's Bedroom\" (1990). Horn presently lives and works in Paris and Berlin.\n\nRebecca Horn was born on 24 March 1944 in Michelstadt, Germany. She was taught to draw by her Romanian governess and became obsessed with drawing with expression because it was not as confining or labeling as oral language. Living in Germany after the end of World War II greatly affected the liking she took to drawing. \"We could not speak German. Germans were hated. We had to learn French and English. We were always traveling somewhere else, speaking something else. But I had a Romanian governess who taught me how to draw. I did not have to draw in German or French or English. I could just draw.\"\n\nHorn spent most of her late childhood in boarding schools and at nineteen rebelled against her parents' plan of studying economics and decided to instead study art. In 1963 she attended the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg (Hamburg Academy of Fine Arts). A year later she had to pull out of art school because she had contracted severe lung poisoning. \"In 1964 I was 20 years old and living in Barcelona, in one of those hotels where you rent rooms by the hour. I was working with glass fibre, without a mask, because nobody said it was dangerous, and I got very sick. For a year I was in a sanatorium. My parents died. I was totally isolated.\"\n\nAfter leaving the sanatorium Horm began using soft materials, creating sculptures informed by her illness and long convalescence. \n\nHorn lived in Hamburg until 1971, in London for a brief time (1971–2), and since 1973 has lived in Berlin.\n\nHorn is one of a generation of German artists who came to international prominence in the 1980s. She practices body art, but works in different media, including performance art, installation art, sculpture, and film. She also writes poetry. Sometimes her poetry is influenced by her work, and on many occasions it has inspired her work. When Horn returned to the Hamburg academy she continued to make cocoon-like things. She worked with padded body extensions and prosthetic bandages. In the late sixties she began creating performance art and continued to use bodily extensions.\n\nIn 1968 Horn produced her first body sculptures, in which she attached objects and instruments to the human body, taking as her theme the contact between a person and his or her environment. \"Einhorn (Unicorn)\" is one of Horn's best known performance pieces: a long horn worn on her head, its title a pun on her name. She presented \"Einhorn\" at the 1972 Documenta. Its subject is a woman who is described by Horn as \"very bourgeois\", \"21 years-old and ready to marry. She is spending her money on new bedroom furniture\". She walks through a field and forest on a summer morning wearing only a white horn protruding directly from the front of the top of her head, held there by straps. These straps are almost identical to the ones in Frida Kahlo's painting \"Broken Column.\" The image, with wheat floating around the woman's hips, is simultaneously mythic and modern.\n\n\"Pencil Mask\" is another body extension piece, made up of six straps running horizontally and three straps running vertically. Where the straps intersect a pencil has been attached. When moving her face back and forth on a near a wall the pencil marks that are made correspond directly with her movements.\n\n\"Finger Gloves\" is a performance piece and the main prop of that performance piece and was done in 1972. They are worn like gloves, but the finger form extends with balsa wood and cloth. By being able to see what she was touching and the way in which she was touching it, it felt as if her fingers were extended and in her mind the illusion was created that she was actually touching what the extensions were touching. There is another piece that she did that is very similar to this one. It is part of her \"Berlin Exercises\" series done in 1974 called \"Scratching Both Walls at Once\". In this piece she made more finger extension gloves, but this time measured it so that they specifically fit the selected space. If the chosen participant stood in the middle of the room, they could exactly touch opposing walls simultaneously.\n\nAnother piece that involves the illusion of feeling and one's hand is \"Feather Fingers.\" (1972). A feather is attached to each finger with a metal ring. The hand becomes \"as symmetrical (and as sensitive) as a bird's wing\". When touching the opposite arm with these feather fingers one can feel the touch on the left arm and of the fingers on the right hand moving as if to touch the left arm but it is instead the feathers which make contact. Rebecca Horn describes the effect: \"it is as if one hand had suddenly become disconnected from the other like two utterly unrelated beings. My sense of touch becomes so disrupted that the different behavior of each hand triggers contradictory sensations.\" This piece focuses greatly on sensitivity.\n\nHorn continued to explore the image of feathers in her works of the 1970s and 1980s. Many of her feathered pieces wrap a figure in the manner of a cocoon, or function as masks or fans, to cover or imprison the body. Some of these pieces are \"Cockfeather\" (1971), \"Cockfeather Mask\" (1973), \"Cockatoo Mask\" (1973), and \"Paradise Widow\" (1975)\".\"\n\nVarious \"machines\" are the subjects of Horn's work in the 1980s. Among others, she created a machine to mimic the human act of painting in \"The Little Painting School Performs a Waterfall\" (1988). Thirteen feet above the floor on a gallery wall, three fan-shaped paint brushes mounted on flexible metal arms slowly flutter down into cups filled with blue and green acrylic paint. After a few seconds of immersion they snap backward, spattering paint onto the wall, the ceiling, the floor, and onto canvases projected from the wall below. The brushes immediately resume their descent, and the cycle is repeated until each canvas is covered in paint.\n\nIn the 1990s a series of her impressive sculptures were presented in places of historical importance. Examples are the \"Tower of the Nameless\" in Vienna (1994), \"Concert in Reverse\" in Munich (1997), \"Mirror of the Night\" in an abandoned synagogue in Cologne (1998) and \"Concert for Buchenwald\" at Weimar (1999). In Weimar, the \"Concert for Buchenwald\" was composed on the premises of a former tram depot. The artist has layered 40 metre long walls of ashes behind glass, as archives of petrifaction. At the same time, the theme of bodily vitality, which the artist had been exploring since the seventies, was developed in site-specific installations that investigated the subject of the latent energy of places and the magnetic flows of space. This cycle comprises \"High Moon, New York\" (1991); \"El Reio de la Luna\", Barcelona (1992); \"Spirit di Madreperla\", Naples (2002). For the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Horn was commissioned to create the steel sculpture \"L'Estel Ferit\".\n\nMany Horn works also explore ambiguities in the idea of lenses. One would think that a large tinted lens exists for protection and cover, but it also has the effect of drawing attention to the person or figure behind it. The paradox of looking out and looking back is explored in her installation piece for Taipei 101, \"Dialogue between Yin and Yang\" (2002). The work sets up interactions between viewers, environment and sculpture as it uses binoculars and mirrors to suggest the passive and active energies.\n\nIn what amounted to over ten years of life in New York, Horn undertook the production of highly narrative, full-length films, and incorporated the sculptures and movements from her earlier work into this new context of film, transforming their significance. Horn made her first feature-length film in 1978, \"Der Eintänzer,\" about a young man named Max, a blind man, and twins. Later films include \"La Ferdinanda: Sonata for a Medici Villa,\" and \"Buster's Bedroom\". \"La Ferdinanda\" is in German; the other films are in English. In all of these films Horn's obsession with the imperfect body and the balance between figure and objects is apparent. She has also collaborated with Jannis Kounellis and produced some films, including the film \"Buster's Bedroom\" (1990) which was shot by the Academy Award-winning Sven Nykvist and stars Donald Sutherland, Geraldine Chaplin, and Martin Wuttke. For \"Buster’s Bedroom\" und \"Roussel\", she collaborated with German writer Martin Mosebach on the respective screenplays.\n\nA number of Horn’s mechanised sculptures appear in her films, notably \"The Feathered Prison Fan\" (1978)—covered in large overlapping fans that is big enough to enclose an adult inside—in \"Der Eintänzer\" and \"The Peacock Machine\" (1979–80), another sculpture that folds and unfolds beautiful white peacock plumage in \"La Ferdinanda.\"\n\nRebecca Horn is the subject of a book entitled \"The Glance of Infinity\". In 2008 and 2009, Japanese artist Masanori Handa was mentored by Horn as part of the Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative.\n\nWhen Harald Szeemann invited Rebecca Horn to participate in the 1972 Documenta in Kassel, she was a virtually unknown twenty-eight-year-old artist. Sigmar Polke had performed in her piece \"Simon Sigmar\" in 1971, and it was through him that Szeeman heard of her. Horn had her first solo exhibition at the Galerie René Block, West Berlin, in 1973. She has since participated in the Venice Biennale, Skulptur Projekte Münster, and the Biennale of Sydney, and is one of very few artists who has been selected to participate in Documenta on four separate occasions. Her solo show at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, \"Rebecca Horn: Diving through Buster's Bedroom\", featured eighteen large-scale mechanized sculptures that relate to the themes and content of the artist's feature-length film, \"Buster's Bedroom\". In 1993 the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, mounted a mid-career retrospective organized by Germano Celant and Nancy Spector, which traveled to the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin; Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna; Tate Gallery and Serpentine Gallery, London; and Musée de Grenoble. In 2005 the Hayward Gallery in London held a comprehensive Rebecca Horn retrospective; in conjunction with this exhibition, St Paul's Cathedral showed Horn's installation \"Moon Mirror\".\n\nHorn's work is included in major public collections worldwide, including:\n\n\nAt the Carnegie International in 1988, Horn won the Carnegie Prize for an installation work titled \"The Hyra Forest/Performing: Oscar Wilde\". In 1992 Horn became the first woman to receive the prestigious Kaiserring Goslar, and was awarded the Medienkunstpreis Karlsruhe for achievements in technology and art. She was later awarded the 2010 Praemium Imperiale in Sculpture and the Grande Médaille des Arts Plastiques 2011 from the Académie d’Architecture de Paris. In 2012, Horn received the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.\n\n\n"}

The CryoSat-1 spacecraft was lost in a launch failure in 2005, however the programme was resumed with the successful launch of a replacement, CryoSat-2, launched on 8 April 2010.\n\nCryoSat is operated from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany.\n\nCryoSat's primary instrument is SIRAL (SAR / Interferometric Radar Altimeter). SIRAL operates in one of three modes, depending on where (above the Earth's surface) CryoSat was flying. Over the oceans and ice sheet interiors, CryoSat operates like a traditional radar altimeter. Over sea ice, coherently transmitted echoes are combined (synthetic aperture processing) to reduce the surface footprint so that CryoSat could map smaller ice floes. CryoSat's most advanced mode is used around the ice sheet margins and over mountain glaciers. Here, the altimeter performs synthetic aperture processing and uses a second antenna as an interferometer to determine the across-track angle to the earliest radar return. This provides the exact surface location being measured when the surface is sloping.\n\nThe original CryoSat was proposed in 1998 by Duncan Wingham of University College London. The satellite's planned three-year mission was to survey natural and human driven changes in the cryosphere on Earth. It was designed to provide much more accurate data on the rate of change of the surface elevation of the polar ice sheets and sea ice thickness. It was the first ESA Earth Sciences satellite selected through open, scientific competition. It was destroyed on launch October 8, 2005. The existing satellite is therefore, formally speaking, CryoSat-2, but the mission is still known simply as CryoSat.\n\nAlthough largely the same as the original satellite a number of key improvements were included in CryoSat-2. The most significant was the decision to provide a fully duplicated payload to enable the mission to continue if a fault caused the loss of the SIRAL radar, but there were many other changes \"under the hood\". Some of these were caused by obsolescence in the original design, some improved reliability and others made the satellite easier to operate. Despite all the changes the mission remains the same and the performance, in terms of measurement capability and accuracy, remains the same. , the launch was scheduled for February 25, 2010 with a Dnepr rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, but this was delayed. The CryoSat 2 launched on April 8, 2010 at 13:57 UTC.\n\nFor positioning purposes, CryoSat included a DORIS receiver, a laser retroreflector and three star trackers.\n\nThe ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites were precursors that tested the techniques used by CryoSat.\n\nCryoSat-1 was launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia on October 8, 2005, using a Rockot launcher. (Rockot is a modified SS-19 rocket which was originally an ICBM designed to deliver nuclear weapons, but which Russia is now eliminating in accordance with the START treaties.) According to Mr. Yuri Bakhvalov, First Deputy Director General of the Khrunichev Space Centre, when the automatic command to switch off the second stage engine did not take effect, the second stage continued to operate until it ran out of fuel and as a consequence the planned separation of the third (Breeze-KM) stage of the rocket which carried the CryoSat satellite did not take place, and would thus have remained attached to the second stage. The upper rocket stages, together with the satellite, probably crashed in the Lincoln Sea.\n\nAnalysis of the error revealed that it was caused by faults in the programming of the rocket, which had not been detected in simulations.\n\nAfter the launch failure of CryoSat, ESA immediately started to plan a replacement CryoSat mission. This included securing the industrial team which had built the original, ordering parts which have a long delivery time and establishing a funding scheme within existing budgets. Due to the importance of the scientific goals of this satellite, there was enormous support for this, and the initial phases for CryoSat-2 were approved when ESA's Earth Observation Programme Board agreed to build a copy of the spacecraft on February 23, 2006.\n\n\n"}

He also pioneered aerial photography for archaeological interpretation.\n\nAt Avebury, Keiller founded the \"Morven Institute of Archeological Research\", now the Alexander Keiller Museum. In 1943 he sold the land at Avebury to the National Trust for its agricultural value only.\n\nKeiller founded and financed the Sizaire-Berwick Motor Company.\n\nHis fourth wife, Gabrielle Keiller, was also an archaeological photographer, whom he met in connection with Avebury.\n\nAlexander Keiller was born at Binrock House in Dundee on 1 December 1889, the only child of businessman John Mitchell Keiller (1851–1899) and Mary Sime Greig (1862–1907), of the Dundee medical family.\n\nWhen Keiller was nine, his father died, leaving him the sole heir to the wealth generated by the family's business. He was sent to Hazelwood School at Limpsfield in Surrey and from there went on to Eton College. When he was seventeen, his mother died, and he returned home to administer the family business.\n\nOn 2 June 1913, Keiller married Florence Marianne Phil-Morris (1883–1955), the daughter of artist Philip Richard Morris. They moved into Keiller's house in London. After the First World War, they were divorced.\n\nOn 29 February 1924, Keiller married Veronica Mildred Liddell (1900–1964). Veronica shared his interest in archaeology and visited Avebury with him later that year. She was one of the supervisors for the 1925–1929 Windmill Hill excavations, near Avebury, alongside her sister Dorothy Liddell. Following a separation, Keiller divorced Veronica in 1934.\n\nOn 16 November 1938, Keiller married for a third time; his new wife was Doris Emerson Chapman (b. 1901), an artist. She had joined the Morven Institute of Archaeological Research, founded by Keiller, in 1937. Her contributions in this field include detailed illustrations of the stones as part of the West Kennet Avenue excavations and the creation of visual reconstructions of faces from skulls, four of which were from a burial mound at Chippenham.\n\nHe later married a fourth time, to Gabrielle Style (1908–1995). She lived past his death in 1955, and in 1966 she donated the museum and its contents to the nation.\n\nIn 1913, Keiller funded the establishment of Sizaire-Berwick, an Anglo-French manufacturer of luxury cars.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the First World War, he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a temporary lieutenant, moving to the Royal Naval Air Service in December 1914. In 1915 he was invalided out of the service, but in 1918 he joined air intelligence, where he remained until the end of the war.\n\nKeiller began to pursue an interest in archaeology. In 1922 he and O. G. S. Crawford undertook an aerial survey of archaeological sites in south western England. This work led to their publication of \"Wessex from the Air\" in 1928, the first book of aerial archaeology to be published in the UK.\n\nUsing his wealth, Keiller decided to buy nearby Windmill Hill and then undertake excavations there. His work proved that the site was a causewayed enclosure, and it became the monument type-site for decades afterward. He succeeded in getting Tomnaverie stone circle in Aberdeenshire into state guardianship. In 1934, he began a two-year excavation of the West Kennet Avenue, which led south east from the Avebury stone circle. As he discovered buried stones, he had them re-erected, and marked the stone-holes with pillars.\n\nKeiller's first major excavation at Avebury was in 1937, the first of three seasons over the ensuing years. Each concentrated on a quadrant of the circle, clearing undergrowth, restoring and conserving the site. Buried stones, some up to a metre below ground, were uncovered and replaced in their original stone-holes. As with the avenue, he placed concrete pylons to denote missing stones. That same year, he founded the Morven Institute of Archaeological Research.\n\nIn 1938 he discovered the famous barber surgeon of Avebury skeleton in the south west quadrant. Keiller opened his museum that year, to display finds from the Windmill Hill, West Kennet, and Avebury excavations.\n\nKeiller leased and restored Avebury Manor & Garden, now a National Trust property consisting of an early 16th-century manor house and its surrounding garden.\n\nThe Second World War ended excavations at Avebury. Keiller joined the special constabulary at Marlborough and as his duties left little time for archaeology, he had the museum mothballed.\n\nIn 1943, Keiller sold his holdings in Avebury to the National Trust for £12,000, simply the agricultural value of the he had accrued, and not reflecting the immense investment he had made at the site. His excavations at Avebury were unpublished at his death, but were worked up by archaeologist Isobel Smith and published in 1965. In 1966, his widow Gabrielle Keiller donated the Avebury museum and its contents to the nation.\n\nIn 1986, UNESCO designated Avebury (together with Stonehenge and associated sites) as a World Heritage Site. In 2000, it received over 350,000 visitors.\n\n"}

Hooded figures similar to the robed men from the previous episode follow her. She dashes through an exterior door, scales down the building, and, believing herself safe, leaves the building at the street level. Robed pursuers appear and push her back through the door. One of the robed figures pulls a long curved dagger. She blocks his swing, but misses the next. The assassins re-sheath their daggers and depart. The young woman opens her deadened eyes and says in a deep, inhuman voice, \"From beneath you, it devours.\"\n\nDawn awakens Buffy from the nightmare in which she witnessed the German woman's murder and Buffy questions the meaning of her dream. Elsewhere in Sunnydale, something large tears through the ground. Spike sneaks around in the school basement he calls home, seemingly headed for a rat while he speaks aloud. Everything around him begins to shake and he falls to the ground, screaming. Xander drives Buffy and Dawn to school and they talk about high school and Xander's relationship problems.\n\nPrincipal Wood introduces Buffy to her new job and cubicle where she'll be working. Buffy sneaks down to the basement in search of Spike, but doesn't find him. In England, Willow struggles with the need to return to Sunnydale where she'll be forced to face her friends and the trouble she caused. A taxi awaits her as Giles listens to her verbalize her fears and he convinces her that even if her friends don't want her back, her presence on the Hellmouth will be important. Back in Sunnydale, a woman walks her small dog along the sidewalk, but while her back is turned, something sucks the dog through the pavement and into the ground. She runs away and right into Xander, who takes her to the safety of Buffy's house.\n\nThe remaining Scooby Gang console the woman, Nancy, and promise to deal with this unusual creature. Much to everyone's surprise, a cleaned up version of Spike joins them in the living room and offers his assistance in the battle. Spike wants to talk with Buffy, but Dawn and Xander are not happy to see him or with the fact that Buffy didn't inform them that she saw Spike earlier. Buffy goes to talk with Spike privately and he offers to help deal with this underground monster. Buffy eventually agrees to let him help, then explains the game plan to the rest of the group. As Spike leaves with Buffy for patrol, Dawn leaves him with a parting threat that if he ever again harms or touches Buffy, Dawn will set him on fire the next time he goes to sleep. Spike is somewhat unnerved by this which is surprising since Spike is usually not easily frightened.\n\nWhile examining the scene where the dog was eaten, Spike explains that the manifest spirits from the school were the cause of his temporary insanity. Buffy is uncomfortable around him and he doesn't bother apologizing for what he did, just admits to changing. Meanwhile, Xander takes Nancy home and she asks if they can go out sometime. The ground rumbles and a giant worm chases them down a hallway and emerges from the ground with a roar. Once the worm goes away and the two are safe, Nancy starts to talk about her abusive ex-boyfriend and Xander quickly concludes that she made a wish to a vengeance demon.\n\nBuffy and the gang confront Anya at the Bronze and get her to admit to making Nancy's ex-boyfriend Ronnie into a Sluggoth demon. Nancy learns that Buffy and Spike, Spike and Anya, and Anya and Xander had been involved. She asks if anyone there hadn't slept together. Spike and Xander look at each other, knowingly. Anya suddenly realizes that Spike has a soul, but Spike tries to stop her from spilling the news to the rest of the group. He starts to attack Anya and she turns on him, using her vengeance demon strength. Buffy steps in and beats up on Spike while he hits back with a verbal assault of what he did instead of his fists. The fight sends Nancy on the run alone, but her wormy ex-boyfriend is hot on her trail. Meanwhile, Xander tries to convince Anya to reverse the curse on Ronnie, but it's not something she can do easily.\n\nBuffy arrives in time to rescue Nancy from certain death and before Buffy can begin to battle with the giant worm, Spike intervenes. After a few hits with a metal pole, he goes to stab the worm only to have it turn back into Ronnie's human form before Spike makes contact. Spike's chip fires as he realizes that he's attacked a human being. He is terrified as he feels remorse, and he warns Buffy that \"from beneath you, it devours.\" Anya and Xander arrive on the scene and Anya knows she will pay a steep price for reversing the spell.\n\nBuffy chases after Spike and finds him in a church. He's confused and speaks metaphors of what he really is to Buffy. He concludes that she's there to use him like she did before, but Buffy is quick to correct him. He unbuckles his belt telling her that it's time to service the girl. He grabs her throat; she throws him across the room. He tries to explain what he did, to get the missing piece that would allow him to become what she wanted, and that Angel should have warned him of the consequences. Buffy then understands that he got his soul back and is shocked by the revelation. Spike continues to speak of all the voices that are in his head, those of the people he tortured and killed as a vampire, and also that of coming evil beneath. Buffy asks him why he got his soul back, and Spike replies that it was for her forgiveness. Spike turns to a large cross at the front of the church and drapes himself onto it, letting it burn him. Tears flow down Buffy's cheeks as she looks on, as Spike asks \"Can we rest now, Buffy?\"\n\nAbout the ending and his performance, James Marsters says: \"There was a scene between Buffy and me in a church, and I think I ended up draping myself over a cross. I was very, very sad. [It was] a very dramatic scene. [Joss Whedon] didn’t direct it. He saw the footage and came up to me and he said, “Okay, James, I’ve got good news and bad news, what do you want?” I said, “Well, give me the bad news first.” He said, “Okay. That scene that was so important, your whole career-making scene? That sucks. It’s horrible. You kind of overacted. It’s not your fault. It was the direction. But it’s just so on the nose, and it’s just cringe-worthy. Do you want the good news?” I said, “Yeah.” He said, “Okay, I’m going to rewrite it, I’m going to direct it, I’m going to save this, it’s going to be right. Don’t worry.” We filmed 12 to 20 hours to begin with, which is so much longer than other shows. Other shows filmed 12 hours a day for eight days, and they’re going to get an episode out of that. Then, after we finished those eight days, and the main unit started a new episode, we were doing pickups and extra shots on B and splinter units throughout the next week, which was not even entirely legal. But to go back and wholesale throw away an entire day’s work and begin from scratch in the midst of all that other filming was just a huge, huge thing to do. He was willing to do that.\"\n\nNoel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a grade of B, writing, \"I didn't find \"Beneath You\" as easily likable as \"Lessons\", though it had some nice moments of levity, and a good bit of derring-do when Buffy swings in on a rope and saves Nancy from Sluggoth Ronny in a back alley. The worm-scenes would've been better if the special effects weren't so cruddy — honestly, the creature almost looks like a cut-and-paste from an old monster movie — but I dug the idea of extending the theme of evil rising by making it literal. (And the fact that the evil is actually some dude, not a demon per se, is another nice touch.)\" Mikelangelo Marinaro of \"Critically Touched\" also rated the episode a B: \"Here lies an episode that ultimately works because of how generously it spreads around its solid character work and follows-through from last season,\" adding that the final scene \"is creepy, slightly amusing, and utterly heart-breaking.\" Mark Oshiro, focusing on the Anya, Willow and Spike plot-lines, thought that \"this episode was probably necessary in terms of the season's arc, but it \"does\" feel like a single puzzle piece. It didn't feel like a story in and of itself.\"\n\n"}

The station is on the West Coast Main Line, about 52 miles (84 km) from , between and . The station is one of the six stations serving the Milton Keynes urban area.\n\nThe station has four platforms, of which just two (3 and 4) are normally in use.\n\nThe first station was built for the opening of the London and Birmingham Railway on 17 September 1838, on the embankment just north of the canal above Wolverton Park. It proved to be temporary as the railway company purchased an additional 13.5 acres to the south and chose to build a larger, permanent station there in 1840. The new station included refreshment rooms which employed a full-time staff of 29. A hotel was planned but never built. The waiting room was lavishly redecorated for the visit of Queen Victoria in 1844, who spent that Christmas as the guest of the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. In 1881 the main line was re-routed a little to the east (see 'Wolverton bend' below) to allow for expansion of the Wolverton Works and a new station built. The booking hall was a wooden building at street level above the railway line and passengers could reach the platforms via flights of stairs.\n\nThe wooden station stood here for over 100 years until British Rail demolished it in 1991.\n\nFor many years after the wooden station building was demolished, Wolverton railway station was a temporary shed in the car park at track level. A new brick building to replace it was finally opened on 21 June 2012. The new building is also at track level.\n\nIn mid September 2012, the Transport Minister Norman Baker announced in a written answer that the Government had approved London Midland's request to reduce the opening hours of the new ticket office, from the previous 06:00 12:00 to 06:15 11:00 henceforth.\n\nIn 2016, a coffee and snack kiosk opened in the new station booking hall.\n\nWith the advent of fast trains, Wolverton gained notoriety among railwaymen for its famously tight curve. The curve was a result of the station and main line being moved eastward in 1881, to permit extension of the Wolverton Works. The path of the original route is visible at both the north and south ends of the divergence. The Advanced Passenger Train failed its trials here in the early 1990s but the \"Pendolino\" tilting trains passed them in the early 2000s. Near the station, the track crosses the valley of the Great Ouse on a viaduct. Slightly further north, the Northampton loop leaves the main line at Hanslope Junction.\n\nFrom 1865 to 1964, there was a branch line from Wolverton to Newport Pagnell, primarily for employees of Wolverton Works. In 1964 the line was closed to passengers by the Beeching cuts and freight ceased in 1967. Between 1817 and 1864, the section from Great Linford to Newport Pagnell was an arm of the Grand Junction Canal which was then drained to become the track-bed. The route from Wolverton to Newport Pagnell is now a redway. Along the redway, the platforms at New Bradwell and Great Linford are still in place, as are a signal post at Newport Pagnell and an iron bridge taking the line (now the redway) over the Grand Union Canal.\n\nWolverton is served by trains operated by London Northwestern Railway. The typical off-peak service is:\n\nThe station has four platforms, of which just two are normally in use. Platforms 1 and 2 are the 'fast' lines and trains very rarely stop here: they are used by London Northwestern only during works and Avanti West Coast in emergency. Platforms 3 and 4 are used frequently by London Northwestern: Avanti West Coast services pass these platforms (without stopping) only during works.\n\nThe station is at the eastern end of Wolverton, near the junction of Stratford Rd with Grafton Street. The nearest post-code is MK12 5FR. In the chainage notation traditionally used on the railway, its location on the line is from Euston.\n\n\n"}

Over the course of his nine-year career, Wilkes wrestled for the American Wrestling Association, the Global Wrestling Federation, All Japan Pro Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling, and the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nWilkes was heavily recruited as an offensive lineman at Columbia's Irmo High School and played for the South Carolina Gamecocks. One of only four consensus All-American football players in program history, Wilkes added 50 pounds of bulk to his six-foot-three, 225-pound frame to bolster an offensive line that in 1984 helped set school records for touchdowns (49), points (371) and total offense (5,095 yards). Wilkes knew the Gamecocks would do something special when he met first-year head coach Joe Morrison before the 1983 season. Wilkes had quit the team before Morrison was hired but agreed to meet the new coach and former NFL running back at a Columbia restaurant. Del was selected as an All-American starter in 1984 by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), the Associated Press (AP), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WC). Despite a stellar collegiate campaign, Wilkes failed to make the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1985 and the Atlanta Falcons in 1986. When football was over for Wilkes, he turned to a pro wrestling career that he found physically grueling but financially rewarding. Bob Hope, the iconic late comedian annually introduced college All-Americans during holiday television specials. Del Wilkes is one of only four Gamecock consensus All-Americans. The only others are George Rogers (1980), Melvin Ingram (2011) and Jadeveon Clowney (2012).\n\nDel Wilkes, who from 1980–84 played College Football at South Carolina, started out in the American Wrestling Association in 1988 under his real name for a year, before wrestling under the ring name \"The Trooper.\" He wrote his opponents tickets after beating them as part of his police gimmick, and would also hand out plastic police badges to the fans as he came to and from the ring. The Trooper won the AWA World Tag Team Championship with D.J. Peterson on August 11, 1990 at the final AWA television taping. Peterson and Trooper would turn out to be the last AWA World Tag Team Champions. In January 1991, \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" and its sister publications withdrew recognition of the AWA's World Championship status but continued to recognise Trooper and Peterson as incumbent \"AWA Tag Team Champions\" until the promotion finally closed later that year.\n\nAlongside Paul Diamond, Wilkes also headlined the AWA's near-annual supercard/former PPV, Superclash 4. In a cage match, they were victorious over the Destruction Crew, Wayne Bloom and Mike Enos.\n\nWilkes went onto Global Wrestling Federation as a fan favorite and became \"The Patriot\", where he was crowned the first GWF Television Championship in a tournament in 1991. Soon afterwards, the Patriot feuded with Al Perez over the GWF North American Heavyweight Championship, which he won initially on Aug 10, but the victory was disputed. He won the title again in a rematch against Perez two weeks later.\n\nIn September 1991, a man calling himself the Dark Patriot appeared in the GWF. For several months, he taunted the Patriot and claimed that he was the Patriot's dark side. On January 31, 1992, the Dark Patriot faced the Patriot in a title match. The Patriot lost the title and left the GWF.\n\nWrestling as The Trooper, Wilkes received a tryout match at a WWF Superstars taping in Rockford, IL on May 6, 1991 when he defeated WT Jones. The following day in Green Bay, WI at a Wrestling Challenge taping Wilkes defeated Tom Stone. He returned on November 12, 1991 in a dark match at a Wrestling Challenge taping in Springfield, MA. Wrestling this time as The Patriot, Wilkes defeated Brooklyn Brawler. He would then appear in five matches in March 1992, wrestling as either Del Wilkes or The Patriot and facing Rick Martel, Kato (Paul Diamond), and Repo Man.\n\nIn 1992, during his stint in the GWF, Wilkes went to wrestle in All Japan Pro Wrestling. He had success with Jackie Fulton who wrestled as \"The Eagle\" to match Wilkes' Patriot gimmick. On June 2, 1993, The Patriot and the Eagle defeated Kenta Kobashi and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi to win the All Asia Tag Team Championship. The Patriot would hold onto the titles for three months, eventually losing them on September 9, 1993 to Doug Furnas and Dan Kroffat. In late 1993, The Patriot and The Eagle entered the 1993 World's Strongest Tag Determination League where they finished in 7th place with 4 Points.\n\nIn 1994, Wilkes signed with World Championship Wrestling to form a team with Marcus Alexander Bagwell called Stars and Stripes. They feuded with Paul Orndorff and Paul Roma over the WCW World Tag Team Championship. The two teams battled for the titles and exchanged victories in non-title matches for several months. One week after losing the titles at Fall Brawl 1994, Stars and Stripes defeated Pretty Wonderful on September 25, 1994 on \"WCW Saturday Night\". Stars and Stripes held the titles for a month but lost them back to Pretty Wonderful at Halloween Havoc 1994. On November 16, 1994, at Clash of the Champions XXIX, Stars and Stripes regained the titles in a match where Patriot's mask was on the line. Three weeks later, on December 8, Stars and Stripes lost the titles to Harlem Heat (the match would air on edition of January 14, 1995 of \"WCW Saturday Night\"). Wilkes continued wrestling for WCW for several more months until leaving in May 1995.\n\nAfter no-showing the Slamboree pay-per-view in May 1995, he returned to AJPW. He quickly formed a tag team with Johnny Ace. On August 30, 1995, Wilkes and Ace challenged The Holy Demon Army for the World Tag Team Championship but lost. The two then entered the 1995 World's Strongest Tag Determination League where they finished in 4th place with 13 points.\n\nOn January 2, 1996, Wilkes won All Japan's yearly January 2 Heavyweight Battle Royal to give him his second All Japan achievement. For the battle royal victory, Wilkes ended his team with Ace and went into the midcard with little direction. In the spring of 1996, Wilkes entered the 1996 Champion Carnival where he finished in 9th place with 6 points. In the summer of 1996, Wilkes formed a tag team with Kenta Kobashi, on October 12, 1996, they challenged Steve Williams and Johnny Ace for the World Tag Team Championship but they came up short. In November 1996, Wilkes and Kobashi entered the 1996 World's Strongest Tag Determination League where they finished in 3rd place with 16 points, Wilkes even scored a pinfall victory over Toshiaki Kawada.\n\nIn early 1997, Wilkes and Kobashi reunited with Johnny Ace and the three formed the stable: GET (Global, Energetic, Tough). Wilkes involvement with the group only lasted a few months as he left All Japan in July 1997.\n\nOn June 30, 1997 he defeated Rockabilly at a \"Raw is War\" event in Des Moines, Iowa. His TV debut came two weeks later on the July 14, 1997 episode of \"Raw\" and feuded with Bret Hart. The premise of this feud was that Hart had just started his anti-American Hart Foundation, and the Patriot was, as the name implied, a man who stood up for America. He wore a mask with American stars and stripes and carried the American flag. He defeated Hart on television in a match on July 28, 1997 after interference from Shawn Michaels. Wilkes went on to challenge Hart for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at \"\" where Hart forced him to submit with the Sharpshooter. At \"\", Wilkes teamed with Vader against the Hart Foundation's Bret Hart and The British Bulldog, but lost the match. Following Badd Blood, Patriot was scheduled to team with Vader, Goldust, and Marc Mero as part of Team USA at \"Survivor Series 1997\" but suffered a torn triceps weeks earlier, he was replaced by Steve Blackman. He was released in early 1998.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, Wilkes retired due to a torn triceps. Since leaving the business, Wilkes admitted that he had used anabolic steroids and cocaine during his career, starting with his college football days. He spent nine months in prison in 2002 for forging a prescription due to his addiction to painkillers. Wilkes has since quit drugs and as of July 2007, Wilkes resides in Columbia, South Carolina and works at Dick Smith Nissan as a car salesman.\n\nIn a July 25, 2007 interview with WACH reporter Justin Kier, Wilkes discussed his career, steroid use, the Chris Benoit tragedy, and various other topics. Kier's last two questions involved saying goodbye to the fans and giving advice to youngsters in the wrestling business. Wilkes urged young wrestlers to \"learn from our mistakes.\" He said that fifty people who he once worked with in the wrestling business are now dead.\n\nWilkes has appeared on episodes #232 and #278 of \"The Steve Austin Show\" podcast.\n\nIn 2015, his documentary \"Behind The Mask\" was released on DVD.\n\n\n"}

It’s a mind fuck. I don’t dig it. It’s something I do once in a while and I certainly intend to do it again, but I’m much better suited to be part of an ensemble.\"\n\nNavarro recorded an album in 1998 under the name \"Spread\", , playing the majority of instruments. After learning the name was in use by a band, he opted to release it under his own.\n\nThe style and theme of the album are very dark, revolving around events taking place in Navarro's life at the time. Many songs talk about the growing loneliness of the rock star lifestyle and the messy divorce he had experienced.\n\nThe album's title may also have originated with the murder of his mother when Navarro was a teenager. \"I shut my eyes to how precious life is,\" he said, \"and instead I grew to believe that nobody could be trusted.\"\n\nDrummer Matt Chamberlain plays on all songs bar \"Very Little Daylight\" and parts of \"Sunny Day\", with drums by Roy Mayorga of Stone Sour, and \"Not for Nothing\", with drums by Navarro's Jane's Addiction bandmate Stephen Perkins.\n\n\"Everything\" contains a sample of \"The Sporting Life\" by Diamanda Galás and John Paul Jones, from the album of the same name.\n\nThe opening \"Rexall\" was the first single, complemented by a music video directed by Honey.

{"id": "1931336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931336", "title": "The Last Time I Committed Suicide", "text": "The Last Time I Committed Suicide\n\nThe Last Time I Committed Suicide is a 1997 American independent drama film directed by Stephen T. Kay. Based on a 1950 letter written by Neal Cassady to Jack Kerouac, it stars Thomas Jane as Cassady. The cast also includes Keanu Reeves, Adrien Brody, Gretchen Mol and Claire Forlani. It received a limited release on June 20, 1997.\n\nThe action of the letter took place in 1946, when Cassady was 20.\n\nTold from Neal Cassady's (Thomas Jane) perspective, in a form of a letter, the film follows his life before and after the suicide attempt by his longtime lover, Joan (Claire Forlani). Demonstrating Neal's active mind and ever changing thoughts, the film jumps back and forth between before and after the attempt.\n\nThe story begins the day of Joan's suicide attempt, with Neal sitting in the hall outside Joan's hospital room. The story then jumps to the day before the suicide attempt, where a rain soaked Neal whisks Joan away from her job. They have an intimate night together. After, she sits on the bed, sad, but Neal keeps professing his love to her. The scene returns to the hospital room, silence between them. Neal is told he has to leave.\n\nThe story moves ahead, with Ben (Adrien Brody) visiting Neal. He asks Neal if he has been back to the hospital to which Neal replies no. It cuts ahead to Neal wide awake, drinking coffee and eating bread with Ben. In a manic state, Neal tells Ben about the story he wants to write.\n\nNeal encounters his friend Harry (Keanu Reeves), who suggests the two of them pick up some girls and take them out on a road trip in a stolen car. They all drive out into the country, flying down the roads. Later, at Neal's job at a tire plant, Neal's friend Jerry finds Neal obviously high, and saves him from getting in trouble.\n\nEventually, Neal makes amends with Joan, and decides to settle down with her. On his way to pick up a suit for their wedding, he runs into a drunk Harry, who asks him to come in for a beer. Neal ends up drunk, and Harry convinces him to call Mary (Gretchen Mol), his teenaged ex-girlfriend. When Mary sneaks out of her house, her mother calls the police, who arrest Neal just as he is about to leave. He is allowed to make a phone call, but he doesn't know Joan's phone number. When Mary refuses to testify against Neal, the charges are dropped. The police nevertheless hold him on the false premise of suspicion of burglary. After spending a two weeks in jail, Neal is released. He goes to Joan's house, but finds it empty; he waits, but eventually it is obvious she isn't coming back. He walks back down the porch, steals a car, and disappears.\n\nNeal finishes writing the letter and places it in an envelope. Walking away, he throws the pages of his novel into the air, paper flying and landing everywhere.\n\n\nIn a June 1997 interview with \"E!\", Keanu Reeves recalled \"I knew Stephen. He had written this script about Neal Cassady. I told him I dug it. \"I dug it, brother\"—one of the most fun things about the piece was calling everybody \"brother.\" I love that fraternity. \"Hey, brother.\" \"Hey, brother, man.\"—and a couple of months down the road, Stephen asked if I was interested in playing Harry.\" He also revealed he was a fan of Cassady and other beat writers as a teenager, reflecting that \"To me, these writers represented the epic language they used invoking the Greek and Roman gods. That Bacchus and Dionysian aspect resonated with me, and I used that to try and read my life and break out of myself, search for new sensations--living the moment, staying up late, traveling, experiencing.\"\n\nTo better suit the role of Harry, Reeves allowed his weight to balloon out to 200 pounds. However, he had already gained a substantial amount of weight prior to accepting the role; this was due to a back injury he sustained in a game of hockey during the lead up to the filming of 1996's \"Chain Reaction\". Reeves appeared at his normal weight in \"Feeling Minnesota\"—released on September 1996 between \"Chain Reaction\" (August 1996) and \"The Last Time I Committed Suicide\" (June 1997)—since it was filmed prior to \"Chain Reaction\" and the hockey injury.\n\nAfter screening at the 1997 edition of the Sundance Festival in Utah, \"The Last Time I Committed Suicide\" was picked up by indie distributor Roxie Releasing. Their strategy for the film was to give it a platform release. Producer Peter Locke stated in early 1997 that \"this is a film that appeals to a select niche and will be review-driven.\" The film would end up making only $46,362 against a budget of four million dollars, following its release on June 20, 1997. It was intended to be released earlier in June, but was pushed to later in the month, as to avoid competition with \"Con Air\" and \"\". A month prior to the release, director Stephen Kay commented in an interview that \"the film was going to be released June 6, the day the potential blockbusters \"Con Air\" and \"Speed 2\" are opening. I said, \"Do it! We'll just run an ad campaign that says, 'The movie that Keanu Reeves did instead of \"Speed 2!\"\" But the distributors panicked...They decided the big monsters would gobble us up and backed off.\" Reeves at the time criticized the summer release date. He remarked \"I think they've really picked a good time to bring this out--in the summer against \"Batman & Robin\". [Laughs.] Stephen Kay and I both feel it should have come out in the fall, that it's a real fall picture. Know what I mean? It's 50 degrees in New York, you want to go see a picture. \"The Last Time I Committed Suicide\", Neal Cassady...why not?.\"\n\nThe film was subsequently released onto home media, and in its true aspect ratio, having originally been matted for theaters during 1997. On September 13, 2005, it was re-released onto DVD by Universal. The rights to the film are currently held by Multicom Entertainment, who purchased the library of producer Kushner-Locke in 2013. Multicom have since released it to streaming service Amazon Prime.\n\n\"The Last Time I Committed Suicide\" received mixed to positive reviews upon its release. In a review published on June 20, 1997, Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" praised the film's cinematography, writing \"Almost every shot is drenched in rich period detail so acute it has a surreal edge. When Cassady visits an office where one of his girlfriends works as a typist, the place is a hushed dimly lit cathedral to capitalism in which elaborately coiffed secretaries sit in rigid formation behind giant manual typewriters. Later, when Cassady and some friends steal a bright red convertible for a joy ride, the image of the cherry-red car jouncing through a field with snowcapped mountains in the background has the nostalgic tug of a \"Saturday Evening Post\" cover illustration.\" \"Variety\" remarked that the film \"works well as an evocation of the youthful unrest that would soon find cogent subcultural expression.\"\n\nA critical review came from CNN's Paul Tatara, who states that the film's style \"gives you a major headache.\" He also criticized the performance of Reeves, stating that the actor is \"void of talent\" and \"reciting his lines as if they're non-related words strung together as a memory exercise.\" Tatara concluded by pointing out that \"The degrading treatment of the women in the film is its most offensive element.\" Kevin Thomas from the \"Los Angeles Times\" had a more positive view on Reeves' role in the film, writing that it \"leaves you with a feeling of real respect for Reeves for showing up in this modestly budgeted film instead of \"Speed 2\".\" However, he characterized Thomas Jane's Cassady portrayal as \"not all that distinctive\", claiming that \"we wouldn't have much reason to be watching this young man if his name weren't Neal Cassady.\" On a June 28, 1997 episode of Siskel and Ebert, \"The Last Time I Committed Suicide\" received a thumbs up from Gene Siskel and a thumbs down from Roger Ebert. Ebert stated that beat writer Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who was still alive, would have laughed at it. Three weeks later, Ferlinghetti responded to the program in a letter, in which he criticized the film for its \"clean cut\" portrayal of Cassady.\n\nLevi Asher of \"Literary Kicks\" wrote in a retrospective review \"As the world was waiting for Francis Ford Coppola to get busy filming his much-hyped and still-unmade version of \"On the Road\", an unknown writer/director named Stephen Kay was quietly working on his own movie about the Neal Cassady legend. The most notable thing about it is probably the slick editing, which makes creative use of black-and-white, color, stop motion, etc., all blended into an easy-going, fast-moving, almost MTV-like whole. This film will not tax your brain.\"\n\n"}

It was acquired in 2015 by Gtech, which then adopted the IGT name for itself.\n\nIGT was founded as A-1 Supply by William \"Si\" Redd in 1975. It changed its name to Sircoma in 1978, and then to International Game Technology in 1981. The company went public in 1981. A deciding factor in IGT's decision to go public occurred a few years earlier with the success of its video poker machine gaming product. This product served as a \"foot in the door\" for the company into several gaming arenas.\n\nIn 1984, IGT acquired Electronic Data Technologies making the company one of the first to use the computerized player tracking concept and later instrumental in the proliferation of \"frequent-player rewards\" programs, which remain popular in casinos to this day. This initial system gave casinos a new marketing tool in player management. Over time, the tracking system evolved into the company's IGT Advantage and sbX systems.\n\nAfter IGT's initial public offering and listing on NASDAQ, the company debuted many new technologies over several years. A number of products resulted from this process including the S-Slot, which marked the company's entrance into the microprocessor-driven spinning-reel slot market; and the Player's Edge video poker machine. In addition, the company introduced the Nevada Megabucks slot machine, the world's first wide area progressive slot machine system. With an initial base top jackpot of $1 million, this new game allowed for million-dollar player payouts for casinos on the system. During this time, IGT also established an Australian office to focus on the country's club market.\n\nIn January 1991, a decade after its initial public offering, IGT was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The following year IGT Europe was established to service casinos across the continent. In 1994, international expansion continued with the opening of new sales and service offices in Argentina and South Africa. The NYSE also listed IGT as a top-performing stock that year.\n\nLate in 1996, IGT debuted the Wheel of Fortune progressive slot. This game continues to be one of the most popular gaming machines of all time. The Game King video product featuring multi-denomination technology also was introduced during this time.\n\nTwo key acquisitions were made in 1998. They included Barcrest Gaming, located in the United Kingdom, and Sodak Gaming, IGT's gaming distributor for the Native American market.\n\nIn 1998, IGT introduced Triple Play Draw Poker through its partnership with Action Gaming; and the Elvis themed slot machine. The new S2000 spinning reel slot machine system was brought to market in 1999.\n\nIn 2001, IGT became a member of Standard & Poor's 500 list. The company also continued to acquire gaming companies including Silicon Gaming and Anchor Gaming. The acquisition of Anchor Gaming resulted in doubling gaming operations revenue.\n\nDuring 2003, IGT acquired Acres Gaming. The company's bonusing and systems technology were a significant addition to IGT's games and systems products. In 2004, the company introduced its central determination system (CDS) as well as its Class II bingo games and systems to the Native American market. IGT Canada was established to serve the emerging Canadian lottery and gaming markets.\n\nIn 2005, IGT celebrated its 25th anniversary as a publicly traded company and also acquired WagerWorks for its online gaming technology. It was also the year the company unveiled its first multi-level progressive MegaJackpots product, Fort Knox. In an effort to take advantage of emerging markets, new IGT offices were opened in Macau, Mexico and Russia.\n\nGroup play and community bonus games were introduced to the marketplace in 2006 with the debut of Wheel of Fortune Special Edition. The company also celebrated the 10th anniversary of the most popular gaming machines ever made, Wheel of Fortune slots, and the 20th anniversary of the Megabucks wide area progressive game.\n\nDuring the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas in 2006, IGT unveiled the M-P Series. The new multi-player concept focused on roulette and baccarat and was the first of the company's electronic multi-player table game products.\n\nIn 2007, IGT worked to grow their Mexican gaming operation and product sales in the Japanese and Asian markets. In addition, a new IGT office was opened in China. Two intellectual property arrangements were also announced, these included an arrangement with Austrian-based Novomatic focusing on IGT's M-P Series multi-player product and with PureDepth, Inc. for its 3D-like, Multi-Layer Display (MLD) technology.\n\nIGT opened the Global Technology & Interoperability Center in Reno, Nevada early in 2008. This first-of-its-kind research and testing center encompasses a facility, which is available for use by gaming manufacturers, customers and third-party gaming products manufacturers. The collaborative center focuses on product testing in a true-to-life casino atmosphere prior to market release. In an effort to diversify business and market opportunities in the United Kingdom, the company acquired Cyberview Technology, Inc.\n\nThe company opened IGT Technology Development (Beijing) Co., Ltd. in Beijing, China in March 2009. The office was established to research and develop gaming, application and systems in addition to providing support, technical services and training.\n\nIn 2009, Patti S. Hart was named IGT's new president and CEO. That year also saw the release of sbX Tier One package by IGT Network Systems. The sbX system offers a bank-by-bank solution, which gives casino operators the ability to implement server-based technology without the need to commit the entire casino floor.\n\nSex and the City Slots were introduced in fall 2009 in the United States. This game features entertaining game play, bonus rounds on a multi-level progressive jackpots platform.\n\nThe year ended with IGT's sbX Experience Management System being installed at ARIA Resort & Casino at CityCenter in Las Vegas. ARIA's casino floor opened with a first-of-its-kind combination of IGT systems on the server-based network, including IGT Advantage and sbX.\n\nIGT started 2010 with a repeat win at the International Gaming Awards as Best Slot Manufacturer of the Year and continued to win awards throughout the year. These included 16 awards in Casino Player magazine's Best of Gaming for 2010, top honors in Global Gaming Business' 8th Annual Gaming and Technology Awards, wins in the inaugural Casino Enterprise Management Hospitality Operations Technology Awards, and 35 awards in Strictly Slots Best of Slots Awards.\n\nIn the spring of 2010, IGT's sbX Experience Management System was installed in the first European locations as sbX went live at Casino d'Evian in France. This was followed by a number of additional European installations including Casino di Venezia in Italy and Grand Casino Helsinki in Finland.\n\nIn November 2010, the Company celebrated the production of its two millionth slot machine.\n\nLate 2010 also saw the creation of an Interactive division within IGT dedicated to further building its online and mobile gaming presence. IGT's WagerWorks and Million-2-1 groups merged into a single global division headquartered in San Francisco, California. This new division provides gaming products to online and mobile markets in regulated, legal markets globally.\n\nThe year ended with a substantial go-live for both IGT's network systems products and games. The brand new casino resort The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas opened floor-wide in sbX; the majority floor share of games; plus, an entire suite of IGT Advantage system products.\n\nIGT acquired Entraction in 2011. A poker network with headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden. It also acquired Double Down in 2012, a Facebook game company with its headquarters in Seattle.\n\nIn January 2013, IGT filed its preliminary proxy materials and indicated that it had received a Notice of Intent to Nominate four director candidates for election to the IGT Board at the Company's 2013 Annual Meeting through The Ader Group, run by Jason Ader. The intent of the notice was to inform IGT and its shareholders of a proxy battle that was going to take place, and that the Ader group's nominees include the slot-machine maker's former chief executive Charles Mathewson, and Jason Ader himself.\n\nFollowing the initial release by IGT, The Ader Group issued a statement claiming that IGT relayed inaccurate information concerning Jason Ader and the Ader Group's proxy fight. The initial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by IGT suggested that Ader's group seeks election to the board, as Ader and Mathewson control 3 percent of IGT, (8.05 million shares), and they are seeking additional proxies for the company's 2013 annual shareholder meeting to put Mathewson back on the board IGT. IGT maintained its original statement.\n\nOn January 11, 2013, the Ader Group filed its proxy indicating that it had nominated three people for the IGT board, of which Jason Ader was not one of the candidates. The proxy statement charged IGT has lost value as a result of the decisions and direction of its leadership.\n\nThe Ader Group filed its action letter outlining its reasons for the proxy fight and urging stockholders to vote for the Gold slate on January 28, 2013.\n\nIn July 2014, Italian gaming equipment company Gtech agreed to acquire IGT for a total of $6.4 billion, including $4.7 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in assumed debt. The companies would be combined under a new holding company based in the United Kingdom and the Gtech name would be dropped.\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Gtech completed its merger with IGT, and the new combined company's name is International Game Technology PLC.\n\nIn 2005, IGT purchased the UK focused online gaming supplier Wagerworks for $90 million. Wagerworks supplies casino and slot games to various online gaming sites, including Paddy Power, William Hill and Betfair. The company provides over 100 real money wagering options for customers in legalized jurisdictions. Currently online gaming is prohibited in the US, due to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. With an increasing focus on New Media and online distribution channels IGT announced the appointment of Gideon Bierer in January 2010 to head up the division, based in San Francisco. The interactive division also has offices in Paddington, London.\n\nWhen the new Interactive division debuted in late 2010, IGT's separate mobile- and internet-based gaming groups, known as Million-2-1 and WagerWorks, merged and formed one team with 18 years combined experience. IGT Interactive provides regulatory-compliant casino games content and platform solutions including the wide area progressive MegaJackpots series. IGT Interactive's mobile portfolio includes mobile slot, table, lottery and SMS games, mobile marketing, and platform products across all major mobile technologies including Apple and Android.\n\nIn March 2011, the IGT Interactive division moved to 405 Howard Street, Suite 600, in San Francisco, California and announced plans to add 75 positions to their staff. The new Interactive division headquarters, located at the corner of First and Howard in the heart of SOMA, is home to 100 employees today with the ability to accommodate more than 250. The new office triples IGT's total office space in San Francisco, allowing IGT to consolidate employees from two different locations in San Francisco, while also allowing for additional growth.\n\nIGT online game titles include:\n\nPower Blackjack and Three Card Second Chance are unique to IGT online casinos. Three Card Second Chance was developed by gaming consultant and casino game analyst Michael Shackleford also known as The Wizard of Odds.\n"}

The primary 484-bed facility is on six city blocks across the street from U.S. Bank Stadium, with neighborhood clinics in the Minneapolis Whittier and East Lake neighborhoods, and the suburban communities of Brooklyn Center, Brooklyn Park, Golden Valley, St. Anthony and Richfield. A new clinic in the North Loop neighborhood downtown opened in 2017. HCMC has recognized trauma surgery specialists, transplant services, stroke specialists, advanced endoscopy/hepatobilliary center, and hyperbaric oxygen chamber. A new outpatient clinic building opened in 2018. In March 2018, the provider that operates HCMC was rebranded as Hennepin Healthcare. However, the hospital retained the name HCMC.\n\nThe original hospital building, established in 1887 as Minneapolis City Hospital, before being referred to as \"General Hospital\" or \"City Hospital\", sat a block from its current main location. Ownership was transferred to the county in 1964, when it was renamed Hennepin County General Hospital. The hospital took its current name in 1974. By the late 1960s, the hospital was a disorganized patchwork of buildings, leading to the decision to clear and rebuild the facility. The current hospital facility was completed in 1976 and renamed Hennepin County Medical Center, following a $25 million bond passed by voters in 1969. The hospital expanded in 1991 when the adjacent Metropolitan-Mount Sinai Medical Center closed. It gained Level I trauma center status in 1989, the first such site in the state.\n\nThe hospital underwent a governance change in January 2007, which created a new governing entity with greater autonomy from the county government. The hospital's public mission did not change, but this transition was made to ensure the long-term viability of the hospital. In 2012 the hospital partnered with NorthPoint Health and Wellness Center, Metropolitan Health Plan, and Hennepin County's Human Services and Public Health Department to form an accountable care organization called Hennepin Health. By February 2013, Hennepin Health had enrolled 6,000 clients.\n\nIn 2015, the Hennepin County Board allocated $192 million for a new outpatient center which features multiple clinics across from the HCMC entrance. The building opened in March 2018. In 2018, HCMC became Hennepin Healthcare.\n\nHCMC has independent residency programs in dentistry, pharmacy practice, emergency medicine, internal medicine, combined internal medicine/emergency medicine, family medicine, general surgery, podiatric surgery, and psychiatry. In addition, it is a rotating site for many programs from the University of Minnesota, including orthopedic surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, neurosurgery, neurology, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, radiology, dietetics, and many medical subspecialty fellowships. It has independent fellowships in geriatrics, critical care medicine, sleep medicine and nephrology.\n\nNASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren is a graduate of the Emergency Medicine residency program (2002-2005). He was selected to NASA's 20th astronaut class in 2009, and spent 141 days in space on Expedition 44/45 in 2015.\n\nStudents from UCIMED, a medical school in Costa Rica, are given the opportunity to complete a sub-internship at the hospital. The initiative started thanks to an agreement signed on February 2006.\n\nHCMC also provides emergency medical services (Hennepin EMS) for the cities of Minneapolis, Golden Valley, Shorewood, Eden Prairie, St. Louis Park, Hopkins, St. Anthony, Woodland, Excelsior, Deephaven, Tonka Bay, Richfield, and the majority of the city of Minnetonka. Hennepin EMS uses 37 type III ambulances, 4 medical director vehicles, 3 Community Paramedic vehicles and 2 EMS Command units in its fleet. All 911 response vehicles are equipped with state of the art equipment, and two state certified paramedics staff each rig. Hennepin EMS logs over 80,000 911 calls every year from an urban/suburban population base of roughly 770,000.\n\n\n"}

He held 16 titles during a 20-year career, including the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nPerez began wrestling as an amateur in high school and was one of the top athletes in his home state of Florida. He started professional wrestling in 1982. He wrestled in Southwest Championship Wrestling in Texas and formed a team in ICW with Joe Savoldi known as the \"New York Rockers\". He then worked for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico where he teamed a lot with Joe Savoldi and later feuded with Invader l.\n\nIn 1986 Perez wrestled for Bill Watt's Mid-South Wrestling, and teamed with \"Wildcat\" Wendell Cooley and defeated the team of Steve\" Dr. Death\" Williams and Bruiser Bob Sweetan for the Mid-South Tag Team Championship. Sweetan was substituting for Ted DiBiase while DiBiase was touring Asia.\n\nPerez went on to make a name for himself as \"The Latin Heartthrob\" in World Class Championship Wrestling in 1987, where he was the top heel for several months. He was managed by Gary Hart and feuded with Kevin Von Erich, Kerry Von Erich and Dingo Warrior.\n\nPerez won the World Class Texas Championship after supposedly defeating previous champion Warrior in a phantom match in Puerto Rico on 21 June 1987. He later defeated Kevin Von Erich for the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship by forfeit. On 25 December 1987 he successfully defended the title in a steel cage match against Kerry Von Erich, recently returned from a 1986 motorcycle accident. Hart and Von Erich's father Fritz were supposed to be handcuffed together but after Fritz was attacked by several heels and afterwards (kayfabe) collapsed with a suspected heart attack, Hart alone was handdcuffed to the ropes. A distraught (kayfabe) Von Erich nonetheless went ahead with the title challenge. Perez managed to smash Von Erich's head into the handcuffs to score the pinfall win.\n\nVon Erich later defeated Perez for the title. Perez and Hart left for Jim Crockett Promotions.\n\nIn 1988, Perez moved to the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions with Hart and teamed with Larry Zbyszko along with feuding with Nikita Koloff and Dusty Rhodes. In 1989 he wrestled for Dusty Rhodes' Professional Wrestling Federation based in Florida. He won the PWF Florida Heavyweight Title, defeating Mike Graham for the title. He later lost the title to Dustin Rhodes.\n\nAl Perez signed with WWF and made his debut on October 2, 1989 with a win over George South in a dark match at a WWF Superstars taping in Wheeling, WV. Perez was undefeated the first month, wrestling primarily on C shows against Barry Horowitz and The Brooklyn Brawler. His first loss would come against Boris Zukhov on November 13, 1989 in Roanoke, VA. Perez would then continue to wrestle primarily on the undercard, although in one Prime Time Wrestling show host Gorilla Monsoon made mention of a possible tag-team pairing of Perez and Santana. Perez was primarily seen on house shows and Prime Time Wrestling. Despite sustaining losses to the likes of Hercules and Tito Santana, Perez had many wins over wrestlers such as Paul Roma, Jim Powers, The Red Rooster, Koko B. Ware, \"Bullet\" Bob Bradley, Paul Diamond/Kato, Jim Brunzell, and others. His last WWF match was a win over Jim Powers on July 23, 1990 in West Palm Beach, FL.\n\nOn September 5, 1990, Perez competed as The Black Scorpion, wrestling Sting in a losing effort at \"Clash of Champions XII\". According to Ric Flair, Perez was always meant to be The Black Scorpion but quit after finding out he was going to lose. However Perez would wrestle one more match as The Scorpion at a house show in Chicago, IL on September 30.\n\nPerez reached the finals of a tournament to crown the first GWF North American Heavyweight Champion before losing to The Patriot at the promotion's debut show on 10 August 1991 in Dallas, Texas. However, because Perez's feet were under the ropes when he was pinned, the Patriot, as a matter of conscience (kayfabe) refused the victory and vacated the title, defeating Perez cleanly in a rematch on 23 August 1991. Perez was (kayfabe) so impressed with his opponent's integrity and sportsmanship that he changed his ways and became a babyface once again.\n\nPerez traveled to All Japan Wrestling and teamed with Dory Funk Jr against Dan Kroffat & Doug Furnas on December 6, 1991. He would wrestle in tag-team matches for All Japan again in 1993 and 1994. During the 90s Perez also competed in several independent promotions around the United States, including a return to Liberty All-Star Wrestling (LAW) in 2001, where he beat Jimmy Jannetty for the LAW Heavyweight title before retiring from the business in 2002.\n\n\n"}

The novel was published in 2000.\n\nThe protagonist of the novel is a 13-year-old orphan named Tom Mullen. He lives in the Old Swan area of Liverpool with his hostile foster parents and his \"brother\", Brian.\n\nOne night, Tom and Brian creep out to investigate a mysterious excavation near their school and discover that the workmen have uncovered an old graveyard. As Tom is examining the burial ground, he falls into the dark endless pit.\n\nTom wakes up in the countryside near the sea. He sees a group of people gathered around the body of a drowned boy who looks exactly like Tom. Everyone thinks the boy is dead, but Tom does CPR and saves him. The boy's name is Tully Monaghan, and Tom is invited to live with his family. As Tom walks into their cottage, he notices a newspaper saying that the date is September 1847. He is not only somehow in Ireland, he has traveled back in time to the height of the potato famine.\n\nWhen the villagers come under attack from the owners of the land, Tom gets hit on the head and is catapulted back to his own time, 1974. He is devastated that he is no longer with the friendly Monaghans. During football practice Tom realizes he can simply jump back into the pit to return to the past. When he does this, however, he discovers that the Monaghans' cottage has been all but destroyed, Tully's father is dead, and the family has decided to move to Liverpool. Tom goes with them, but later again accidentally returns to the modern day.\n\nThe next night Tom once again jumps down into the grave. He returns to old Liverpool on March 13, 1848 – four months since he last saw the Monaghans. Tully's mother is now very ill with fever and his brother Brendan catches it too; both die in hospital.\n\nTom tells Tully and his sister Hannah, the only remaining members of the family, about his coming from the future. They figure out that Tully is Tom's great-grandfather and that the reason why Tom came to the past was that if Tully had died on the beach, Tom would never have been born. Tom decides to return to his own time, only to be literally kicked out of the house by his foster parents. That night Tom goes to the grave, takes Ma's and Brendan's coffins and buries them in a church graveyard.\n\nA few months later, Tom's football coach asks him why he changed his last name to Monaghan.

{"id": "1931416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931416", "title": "Blue iguana", "text": "Blue iguana\n\nThe blue iguana (\"Cyclura lewisi\"), also known as the Grand Cayman ground iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana or Cayman Island rock iguana, is an endangered species of lizard which is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. It was previously considered to be a subspecies of the Cuban iguana, \"Cyclura nubila\", but in a 2004 article Frederic J. Burton reclassified it as a separate species because according to him the genetic differences discovered four years earlier between the different \"C. nubila\" populations warranted this interpretation. The blue iguana is one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly up to 69 years).\n\nThe preferred habitat for the blue iguana is rocky, sunlit, open areas in dry forests or near the shore, as the females must dig holes in the sand to lay eggs in June and July. A possible second clutch is laid in September. The blue iguana's herbivorous diet includes plants, fruits, and flowers. Its color is tan to gray with a bluish cast that is more pronounced during the breeding season and more so in males. It is large and heavy-bodied with a dorsal crest of short spines running from the base of the neck to the end of the tail.\n\nThe iguana was possibly abundant before European colonization; but fewer than 15 animals remained in the wild by 2003, and this wild population was predicted to become extinct within the first decade of the 21st century. The species' decline is mainly being driven by predation by cats and dogs, and indirectly by reduction in suitable habitat as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing. Since 2004, hundreds of captive-bred animals have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in an attempt to save the species. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of the blue iguana.\n\nIts specific name \"lewisi\" commemorates the name of the scientist who collected the holotype of this species, Charles Bernard Lewis.\n\nThe closest relatives are the Cuban iguana (\"Cyclura nubila\") and the Northern Bahamian rock iguana (\"C. cychlura\"). It can be genetically distinguished from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as \"C. nubila caymanensis\", although it can interbreed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.\n\nIn 1938 Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica joined an Oxford University biological expedition to the Cayman Islands. Lewis obtained two blue iguanas, a male and a female, which were later lodged with the Natural History Museum, London. Chapman Grant, in an article published in 1940, formally described the blue iguana as an separate taxon for the first time, classifying it as the trinomial \"C. macleayi lewisi\". Albert Schwartz and reclassified it as \"C. nubila lewisi\" in 1975, making it a subspecies of the Cuban iguana. In his 2004 article Frederick Burton repeatedly states Schwartz and Carey reclassified it in a 1977 publication, but he is mistaken.\n\nBurton, who runs the captive breeding program on the island, reclassified the blue iguana as a distinct species in 2004. Although it has almost identical head scale counts and patterns as \"C. nubila\", most individuals of this taxon often have five auricular spines in as opposed to four in \"caymanensis\", although this is not diagnostic, and individuals of the nominate subspecies shows either morphologies in similar proportions. Also most \"lewisi\" have an extra pair scales behind the prefrontals, although not always and individuals from the other populations may also have these. Thus Burton concluded that using scale characteristics these three taxa could not be told apart in a consistent manner. According to him most important difference between the \"lewisi\" population and the other two is skin color. Although skin color is a variable characteristic that is usually considered unsatisfactory in taxonomy, Burton thought that in this instance it might be appropriate. Although all three taxa hatch with the same color, as they grow older \"lewisi\" becomes more uniformly bluish, whereas the other taxa can be more variable in coloration, although Burton states that this characteristic is not reliable in many circumstances, such as rainy weather. Other reasons Burton gave for recognising \"lewisi\" as a separate species were geography, there is at least 108 kilometres separating the forms, which Burton then interpreted to mean that the populations were reproductively isolated, despite there being no reproductive barriers between the populations. Grant reported seeing \"caymanensis\" on Grand Cayman in 1940, but Burton states that this was likely a mistaken sighting made during rainy weather. Lastly Burton points to mitochondrial DNA analysis performed by Catherine Malone \"et al\". in 2000; although the sample size was extremely small and there was some ambiguity, the different populations did have different haplotypes. Although Malone \"et al\". found \"C. nubila\" \"sensu lato\" to be monophyletic, Burton claimed \"lewisi\" could be separated from the other two taxa without rendering \"C. nubila\" polyphyletic. Although none of this might be used to traditionally delineate a population as a species, he proposed using the \"general lineage concept\" introduced by de Queiroz in 1998 to do so anyway.\n\nThis animal was originally called the Grand Cayman rock iguana, or Grand Cayman blue rock iguana. After separating this population taxonomically from the other Cayman Islands rock iguanas, Burton proposed a set of new vernacular name for the population in 2004: Grand Cayman blue iguana, Cayman blue iguana or for local colloquial use he proposed the simple abbreviated blue iguana.\n\nNote that the name \"blue iguana\" is also used for bright blue forms of the green iguana, \"Iguana iguana\".\n\nThe blue iguana is the largest native land animal on Grand Cayman with a total nose-to-tail length of and weighing as much as . This is among the largest species of lizard in the Western Hemisphere. Its body length is 20–30 inches (51–76 cm) with a tail equal in length. The blue iguana's toes are articulated to be efficient in digging and climbing trees. The mature male's skin color ranges from dark grey to turquoise blue, whereas the female is more olive green to pale blue. Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint darker banding. When they first emerge from the nest the neonates have an intricate pattern of eight dark dorsal chevrons from the crest of their necks to their pelvic area. These markings fade by the time the animal is one year old, changing to mottled gray and cream and eventually giving way to blue as adults. The adult blue iguana is typically dark gray matching the karst rock of its landscape. The animal changes its color to blue when it is in the presence of other iguanas to signal and establish territory. The blue color is more pronounced in males of the species. Their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to their lighter overall body color. The blue iguana's eyes have a golden iris and red sclera.\nBlue iguanas are sexually dimorphic; males are larger and have more prominent dorsal crests as well as larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. The male is larger than the female by one third of his body size.\n\nThe blue iguana, \"Cyclura lewisi\", is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. As of 2012 the population can be found throughout the island Grand Cayman excluding the urban areas of Bodden Town, Gun Bay, Seven Mile Beach and West Bay. One theory for how the taxon ended up on the island is that a single female Cuban iguana, \"C. nubila nubila\", with eggs inside her drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm. Sometimes the Lesser Caymans iguana, \"C. nubila caymanensis\", has been found on Grand Cayman.\n\nThe blue iguana is found only on the island of Grand Cayman. Comparison with other \"Cyclura\" species in the region strongly suggests that there was once a coastal population of blue iguanas which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of roads. The blue iguana now only occurs inland in natural xerophytic shrubland and along the interfaces between farm clearings, roads, and gardens and closed-canopy dry forest or shrubland. The interior population is believed to have been attracted to agricultural clearings and fruit farms which provide thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but this brought the blue iguana into contact with humans and feral animals. Females often migrate to coastal areas to nest. Blue iguanas released into the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman were radiotracked in 2004 to determine ranges for each animal. Females were found to occupy territories of and males an average of with overlap in common territories, indicating that they choose to maintain a population density of four to five animals per hectare.\n\nThe blue iguanas occupy rock holes and tree cavities, and as adults are primarily terrestrial. Although not known to be arboreal, it has been observed climbing trees and higher. Younger individuals tend to be more arboreal.\n\nLike all \"Cyclura\" species, the blue iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 45 species of plant. The diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, crabs, slugs and fungi.\n\nHatchlings are preyed upon by the native snake \"Alsophis cantherigerus\". The adults have no natural predators.\n\nLongevity in the wild is unknown but is presumed to be many decades. A blue iguana named \"Godzilla\" captured on Grand Cayman in 1950 by naturalist Ira Thompson was imported to the United States in 1985 by Ramon Noegel and sold to reptile importer and breeder, Tom Crutchfield in 1990. Crutchfield donated Godzilla to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas in 1997 and the lizard remained there until its death in 2004. Thompson estimated Godzilla to be 15 years of age at the time of his capture. At an estimated 69 years of age (54 of which were spent in captivity), Godzilla may be the world's longest-living lizard for which there is reliable record. A closely related Lesser Caymans iguana (\"C. nubila caymanensis\") has been documented as living 33 years in captivity.\n\nMating occurs from May through June. Copulation is preceded by numerous head-bobs on the part of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps the nape of her neck. He then attempts to restrain the female in order to manoeuvre his tail under hers to position himself for intromission (sex). Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. A clutch of anywhere from 1 to 21 eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. Several exploratory nests are begun before one is completed. These burrows can range from to over in length, with an enlarged chamber at its terminal portion to allow the female to turn around. The temperature within nests that have been monitored by researchers remained a constant throughout the incubation period which ranges from 65–90 days. The blue iguana's eggs are among the largest laid by any lizard.\n\nIndividuals are aggressively territorial from the age of about three months onward. They typically reach sexual maturity after four years of age in captivity.\n\nThe blue iguana is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. In 1988 the British researcher Roger Avery spent two weeks on the island and only observed three animals. Surveys in 2003 indicated a total population in the range of 5–15 individuals. In 2006 the iguana was one of the most endangered lizards on Earth.\n\nRestored free-roaming subpopulations in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and the Salina Reserve numbered approximately 125 individuals in total after an initial release in December 2005. The restored subpopulation in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park has been breeding since 2001, and the subpopulation in the Salina Reserve was deemed to be breeding in 2006 after a nest of three hatched eggs was discovered in the wild. In April 2007, after another large-scale release, there were 299 blue iguanas living in the wild, with hundreds more being raised in captivity on Grand Cayman. In late 2012, the blue iguana recovery program estimated that the wild population had risen to approximately 750 individuals, and the IUCN subsequently downlisted the species from critically endangered to endangered.\n\nHabitat destruction is the main factor threatening extinction for this iguana. Land clearance within remnant habitat is occurring for agriculture, road construction, and real estate development and speculation. The conversion of traditional crop lands to cattle pasture is eliminating secondary blue iguana habitat.\n\nPredation and injury to hatchlings by rats, to hatchlings and sub-adults by feral cats, and killing of adults by pet dogs are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population. Automobiles and motorscooters are an increasing cause of mortality as the iguanas rarely survive the collisions. Trapping and shooting is a comparatively minor concern, and has stopped according to the IUCN in 2012, but before 1995 occasional trapping may have occurred.\n\nThe common green iguana, (\"Iguana iguana\"), has been introduced from Honduras and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an invasive species. It far outnumbers the native blue iguana. No direct negative consequences on the blue iguana due to this introduction are known, but the mere presence of the green iguana confuses public attitudes and understanding. For example, the people of the island are told that blue iguanas are endangered and rare, but the green iguana look very similar and quite common in suburban areas.\n\nIn 2008 six blue iguanas were found dead in the preserve within Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman. The iguanas were apparently killed by human vandals armed with knives and two of the slaughtered animals were gravid females about to lay eggs.\n\nThe wild population of blue iguanas had been reduced from a near island-wide distribution to a non-viable, fragmented remnant. By 2001 no young hatched in the unmanaged wild population were surviving to breeding age, meaning the population was functionally extinct, with only five animals remaining in the wild.\n\nIn 1990, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association designated the genus \"Cyclura\" as their highest priority for conservation. Their first project was an \"in situ\" captive breeding program for the blue iguana.\n\nOne of the early difficulties encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure. It was discovered through DNA analysis that the captive population contained a number of animals that were hybrids with \"C. nubila caymanensis\". These hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies so that the program contain only pure-breeds. This program was created to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals and DNA analysis revealed that the entire North American captive population was descended from a single pair of animals.\n\nAs a hedge against disaster striking the blue iguana population on Grand Cayman, in 2004 an \"ex situ\" captive population was established in 25 zoos in the USA. A minimum of 20 founder lines represented by at least 225 individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a studbook for the species by Tandora Grant of the San Diego Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species. By 2002 the Indianapolis Zoo had success with breeding the blue iguana in captivity twice since the year 2000.\n\nIn October 2006, hatchlings were released into the wild for the first time to boost the species and help bring them back from the brink of extinction. Each released blue iguana wears a string of colored beads through its nuchal crest for visual identification at a distance, backed up by an implanted microchip and a high-resolution photograph of its head scales. Head scale patterns are as unique among blue iguanas as fingerprints are among humans.\n\nThe blue iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections. There are very few pure-bred animals in private collections, animals in captive breeding programs are often hybrids with the Lesser Caymans Iguana (\"C. nubila caymanensis\") and occasional hybrids with the Cuban Iguana (\"C. nubila nubila\"). Breeding in the pet trade minimizes the demand for wild-caught specimens.\n\nThe Blue Iguana Recovery Programme grew from a small project started in 1990 within the National Trust for the Cayman Islands. It is now a partnership, linking the Trust with the Cayman Islands Department of Environment, National Trust Cayman Islands, Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, International Reptile Conservation Foundation, IRCF, and the European Commission. This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands, which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas. BIRP's conservation strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, headstarting them for two years so that their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas. A rapid numerical increase from a maximum possible number of founding stock is sought to minimize loss of genetic diversity caused by a population bottleneck.\n\nRestored sub-populations are present in two non-contiguous areas —the Salina Reserve and the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park. Habitat protection is still vital, as the Salina Reserve has only of dry shrubland, which is not enough to sustain the 1,000 blue iguanas that were planned to be restored to the wild. The 2001 plan called for additional sub-populations to be restored in one or more other areas. When the wild sub-populations have reached the carrying capacity of their respective protected areas, release of head-started animals will be phased out.\n\nThe overall captive population is likely to remain genetically fragmented in the long term. To maintain gene flow, individuals should be translocated between zoos.\n\nAccording to the 2001 plan, breeding of blue iguanas in the wild will require indefinite future management. To sustain this activity, a range of commercial activities was hoped to generate the required funding. An education and awareness effort in 2007 was meant to ensure local involvement and support.\n\nIn April 2019, one iguana laid 18 eggs for possible hatching. Any survivals will be the first successful breeding since 2015. In 2018, seven eggs were laid but none hatched.\n\n"}

Isoflavones are produced almost exclusively by the members of the bean family, Fabaceae (Leguminosae).\n\nAlthough isoflavones and closely related phytoestrogens are sold as dietary supplements, there is little scientific evidence for either the safety of long-term supplementation or of health benefits from these compounds. Some studies have identified potential risks from high intake of isoflavones, such as in women with a history of breast cancer, but this concern has not been substantiated with high-quality clinical research.\n\nIsoflavones of nutritional interest are substituted derivatives of isoflavone, being related to the parent by the replacement of two or three hydrogen atoms with hydroxyl groups. The parent isoflavone is of no nutritional interest. \n\nIsoflavones are produced via a branch of the general phenylpropanoid pathway that produces flavonoid compounds in higher plants. Soybeans are the most common source of isoflavones in human food; the major isoflavones in soybean are genistein and daidzein. The phenylpropanoid pathway begins from the amino acid phenylalanine, and an intermediate of the pathway, naringenin, is sequentially converted into the isoflavone genistein by two legume-specific enzymes, isoflavone synthase, and a dehydratase. Similarly, another intermediate naringenin chalcone is converted to the isoflavone daidzein by sequential action of three legume-specific enzymes: chalcone reductase, type II chalcone isomerase, and isoflavone synthase. Plants use isoflavones and their derivatives as phytoalexin compounds to ward off disease-causing pathogenic fungi and other microbes. In addition, soybean uses isoflavones to stimulate soil-microbe rhizobium to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules.\n\nMost members of the family Fabaceae contain significant quantities of isoflavones. Analysis of levels in various species has found that the highest levels of genistein and daidzein in psoralea (\"Psoralea corylifolia\"). Various legumes including soybean (\"Glycine max\" L.), green bean (\"Phaseolus vulgaris\" L.), alfalfa sprout (\"Medicago sativa\" L.), mung bean sprout (\"Vigna radiata\" L.), cowpea (\"Vigna unguiculata\" L.), kudzu root (\"Pueraria lobata\" L.), and red clover blossom and red clover sprout (\"Trifolium pratense\" L.) have been studied for their estrogenic activity. Highly processed foods made from legumes, such as tofu, retain most of their isoflavone content, and fermented miso, which has increased levels.\n\nOther dietary sources of isoflavones include chick pea (biochanin A), alfalfa (formononetin), and peanut (genistein). Isoflavones are also found in foods of animal origin such as dairy products, meat, eggs and seafood, but the overall contribution to total intake is low. In countries using the chorleywood bread process, such as in the UK, bread is a source of isoflavones from soy.\n\nIn plant tissue, they most often occur as glycosides or their respective malonates or acetyl conjugates, rendering them even more water-soluble (see isoflavone-7-O-beta-glucoside 6\"-O-malonyltransferase). The latter forms are unstable and are transformed, e.g. by decarboxylation. Often when leguminose plants are challenged with viral or fungal infections, the water-soluble transport forms are hydrolyzed to the respective aglycones at the target site.\n\nThe consumption of isoflavones-rich food or dietary supplements is under preliminary research for its potential association with lower rates of postmenopausal cancer and osteoporosis in women. Use of soy isoflavone dietary supplements may be associated with reduction of hot flashes in postmenopausal women.\n\nDespite the frequent use of isoflavone supplements, there are insufficient data on safety and adverse effects. Isoflavones have GRAS status in the United States. The European Food Safety Authority has conducted a risk assessment of isoflavone supplements for post-menopausal women and could not identify adverse effects with intakes up to 150 mg/d, although it criticised the lack of data.\n\n"}

The setting of the novel was changed to Louisiana State University for the movie adaptation. The main character, Gavin Grey, wins the Heisman Trophy and then goes on to a professional career, but is sidetracked by alcoholism, failed business ventures, and marital difficulties among other misjudgments.\n\nThe novel is narrated by Grey's nephew, Donnie McClure, a historian who has written a biography of Confederate war hero J.E.B. Stuart. During his college career, Grey's heroics are often compared to Stuart's actions. Both are celebrated not only for their actions, but for their gentle behavior and consideration for others around them.\n\nGrey's greatest moments came away from the football field. At a fraternity party, a carelessly placed cigarette ignites the dress of a young woman, who staggers back in fear and nearly starts a much larger fire by lighting a set of drapes. Despite a strong fear of fire, Grey saves the woman by leaping forward and dousing the flames. A few weeks later, Grey, McClure, and a UNC teammate, Lawrence, venture into a black neighborhood where Grey meets Narvel Blue, another one-time football star whose greatness was never realized because of bad grades, segregation, and bad luck. Blue and Grey compare attributes but decide that a foot-race must be held to determine which is the faster runner. Despite falling behind initially, Grey eventually overcomes Blue by a shade at the end of the race.\n\nAfter a serious knee injury cuts short his professional career, he is miserable in retirement and returns to accept a lesser role with the Baltimore Colts. However, his season, and ultimately his football career, end after a knee injury in his third game. Grey is left calling every team in the NFL, begging for one more chance.\n\nGrey is left to constantly reminisce about his glory days on the football field, boring and embarrassing those around him. His once-gawky and awkward nephew Donnie becomes a respected scholar and biographer, and his beauty queen wife, Babs, becomes a successful career woman. All of Grey's former teammates move toward their life off the gridiron with infinitely more grace, while Narvel Blue overcomes racism in the South to become a successful restaurateur.\n\nAs each day passes, Grey falls farther away from his moments of glory. And with each passing day, his relevance, sense of place, and his grasp of the world around him fade until he is diminished to little more than a ghost.\n\nSome have said that the main character in the novel is based on Charlie \"Choo-Choo\" Justice, a real-life North Carolina football star. Then, after the movie was released, simply because the film had been relocated to Louisiana, there were rumors that Deford had based Gavin Grey on LSU's All-American running back, Billy Cannon. Deford has always vigorously denied that the character of Gavin Grey was based on any real person, but was, in fact, a composite of many college stars he had known in several sports. \"Never met Justice or Cannon, and hardly knew anything about them.\" he says.\n"}

The green fruits contain a toxic milky sap that is extremely bitter and turns into a gluey coating which is resistant to soap.\n\nCommon names for the plant include Apple of Sodom, Sodom apple, stabragh, king's crown, rubber bush, and rubber tree. The name Apple of Sodom and Dead Sea Apple comes from the fact that the ancient authors Josephus and Tacitus described it as growing in the area of biblical Sodom.\n\nSome biblical commentators believe that the Sodom apple may have been the poisonous gourd (or poison-tasting gourd) that led to \"death in the pot\" in the Second Book of Kings (). In this story, a well-meaning servant of the prophet Elisha gathers herbs and a large quantity of the unknown gourds, and casts them into the pot. After the outcry from the band of prophets, Elisha, instructs them to cast flour into the stew pot, and they are saved.\n\nIn 1938, botanists Hannah and Ephraim HaReuveni, authors of \"The Squill and the Asphodal\", speculated that Jeremiah's \"arar\" was the Sodom apple.\n\nThe fibre of the Sodom apple may have been used for the linen of the high priests.\n\nThe fruit is described by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, who saw it growing near what he calls Sodom, near the Dead Sea: \"...as well as the ashes growing in their fruits; which fruits have a color as if they were fit to be eaten, but if you pluck them with your hands, they dissolve into smoke and ashes.\" (Whiston 1737: Book IV chapter 8 section 4)\n\nSodom apple is listed in the Mishnah and Talmud. The fibers attached to the seeds may have been used as wicks. However the Mishnah forbids this for the Sabbath: \"It may not be lighted with cedar-bast, nor with uncombed flax, nor with floss-silk, nor with willow fiber, nor with nettle fiber. – Sabbath Chapter 2\"\n\nIn his \"Biblical Researches in Palestine\", American biblical scholar Edward Robinson describes it as the fruit of the \"Asclepias gigantea\" vel \"procera\", a tree 10–15 feet high, with a grayish cork-like bark called \"'osher\" by the Arabs. He says the fruit resembled \"a large, smooth apple or orange, hanging in clusters of three or four.\" When pressed \"or struck, it explodes with a puff, like a bladder or puff-ball, leaving in the hand only the shreds of the thin rind and a few fibers. It is indeed filled chiefly with air, which gives it the round form; while in the center a small slender pod runs through it which contains a small quantity of fine silk, which the Arabs collect and twist into matches for their guns.\"\n\nThe plant is known to occur throughout the tropical belt and is also common in the West Indies (e.g. Jamaica), where the locals know it as \"pillow cotton\". When the ripe \"apples\" burst, the fibrous contents are ejected along with the seeds. The former are collected by the Jamaicans and used for filling pillows.\n\nThe milky sap contains a complex mix of chemicals, some of which are steroidal heart poisons known as \"cardiac aglycones\". These belong to the same chemical family as similar ones found in foxgloves (\"Digitalis purpurea\").\n\nThe plant contains steroidal components that are the cause of its toxicity. In the case of the Calotropis glycosides, their names are calotropin, calotoxin, calactin, uscharidin and voruscharin.\n\nJohn Milton alludes to this plant in his epic poem, \"Paradise Lost\", while describing the fruit that Satan and his cohorts eat after having tempted Adam and Eve to eat an apple from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil:\n...greedy they pluck'd<br>\nThe Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew<br>\nNeer that bituminous Lake where \"Sodom\" flam'd;<br>\nThis more delusive, not the touch, but taste<br>\nDeceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay<br>\nThir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit<br>\nChewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste<br>\nWith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd<br>\nHunger and thirst constraining...<br>\nMarilyn Manson recorded a song named \"Apple of Sodom\" for the soundtrack album of the 1997 David Lynch film \"Lost Highway\".\n\n"}

In the , Darra had a population of 4,343 people.\n\nDarra is located about southwest of Brisbane central business district.\n\nThe suburb features the cross over of the Ipswich Motorway (M7) and Centenary Motorway (M5).\n\nSurrounding suburbs include Seventeen Mile Rocks, Oxley, Sumner, Richlands, and Jamboree Heights.\nThe first subdivisions in the area occurred in 1864.\n\nWolston Estate was the property of M. B. Goggs, whose father obtained the land forty years previously in the 1860s and after whom Goggs Road is named. \n\nThe name \"Darra\" comes from the Darra railway station, which in turn was named in mid-1876 by the Queensland Railways Department. In 1914, the Railways did not know the origin of the name.\n\nIn 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the area of Wolston Estate.\n\nA portion of Darra comes from the Wolston Estate, consisting of 54 farms on an area of 3000 acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901. Only three of the farms sold at the original auction.\n\nIn 1914 Queensland Cement and Lime Company was formed established a cement manufacturing plant in Darra. The company (by then known as Queensland Cement Limited) closed the Darra plant in 1998 after losing its right to dredge Moreton Bay for coral from which lime was extracted to make cement.\n\nDarra State School opened on 1 June 1916.\n\nIn 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.\n\nOur Lady of the Sacred Heart School was established on 5 April 1937 by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart. In 1987 the school opened a pre-school at Jindalee and the school's name became Darra-Jindalee Catholic School. The Jindalee site was closed in 2003. On 14 July 2008 the school was again renamed to be Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School Darra.\n\nIn 1954, the Darra RSL Memorial Hall was opened. Sumner was known as Darra until 1969 when it became a separate suburb. Vietnamese refugees began to settle in the area in 1975. The origin of the word Darra came from the Aboriginal word for 'stones'.\n\nThe houses are mainly of the Queenslander style built in the 1940s and 1950s. The majority of blocks in Darra are large enough to be subdivided, which is becoming popular in the suburb, hence making room for more modern homes. In the last few years, a property developer bought a vast tract of vacant, government land. As a result, there are now many new homes and townhouses built in Darra, which has increased its population and its geographical boundaries.\n\nIn the , Darra had a population of 4,343 people.\n\nDarra railway station provides access to regular Queensland Rail City network services to Brisbane CBD, Ipswich, Rosewood and Springfield. The Darra railway station is the name given to the suburb it came to serve. As the railway was built through the area a stop was allocated at a distance of \"nine miles forty four chain\", halfway between the planned Oxley railway station and Wacol railway station. The station was one terminus for the first of Brisbane's electric rail lines, linking to Ferny Grove railway station in 1979.\n\nThe Centenary Freeway and the Ipswich Motorway provide access to the Brisbane CBD. There are also buses that travel to surrounding suburbs such as Inala and Mount Ommaney.\n\nDarra State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Winslow Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 201 students with 22 teachers (16 full-time equivalent) and 17 non-teaching staff (12 full-time equivalent).\n\nOur Lady of the Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 115 Darra Station Road ().

Here is the posted blurb:\n\"I wish that I could be more specific about what happened. It's a long story and it doesn't matter anyhow. What matters is that the old makes way for the new. We are all still doing music in some capacity, some of us are together and some of us aren't.

His full name is Avraham Abele ben Chaim HaLevi from the town of Gombin. There are texts that list his family name as Kalisz after the city of his residence. After his parents were killed in the Chmielnicki massacres of 1648, he moved to live and study with his relative in Leszno, Jacob Isaac Gombiner.\n\nHe is known to scholars of Judaism for his \"Magen Avraham\" commentary on the \"Orach Chayim\" section of Rabbi Joseph Karo's \"Shulchan Aruch\", which he began writing in 1665 and finished in 1671. His brother Yehudah traveled in 1673 to Amsterdam to print the work, but did not have the needed funds, and died on the journey. It was not published until 1692 by Shabbethai Bass in Dyhernfurth after Rabbi Gombiner's death. His son Chaim wrote in the preface to the work that his father was frequently sick and suffered pain and discomfort.\nHis most important work was \"Magen Avraham\", a commentary on Shulchan Aruch, Orach Hayyim. It is not to be confused with works by the same title by Abraham Farissol and Avraham the magid of Trisk.\n\nHe also wrote \"Zayit Ra'anan\", a commentary on the popular midrashic collection \"Yalkut Shimoni\".\n\nHe also authored a commentary to the works of the Tosefta on the section of Nezikin in the Talmud, published by his grandson together with the work by R. Abraham's son-in-law Moshe Yekutiel Kaufman, \"Lehem Hapanim\" (1732).\n\nHe wrote a commentary on the Torah entitled \"Shemen Sason\", but much of it has been lost.\n\nGombiner's son Chaim named the book \"Magen Avraham\", using his father's name in the title. His father's students mentioned to him that they asked his father how he will name his book and he answered \"Ner Yisrael\" (\"Lamp of Israel\") (abbreviation: נר יפה של רבי אברהם הלוי) . Apparently, because of humility he did not want to integrate his name in the book. However, his son wanted to perpetuate his father's name in the title by linking it to the commentary of the \"Taz\" - \"Magen David\", so he published his father's work under the title \"Magen Avraham\".\n\nAaron Worms criticized him for titling the book with a traditional title for God and referencing the closing of the first blessing in the Amidah. However, Chaim Michael states that there is no basis for his critique and its all empty talk.\n\nGombiner's innovative approach to commenting on the \"Shulchan Aruch\" was to incorporate the customs of his contemporary Poland. The work is terse and difficult and needed explanation by later commentators. His lasting effect on halakhah was the incorporation of the Kabbalistic customs of Safed, especially those found in Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz's \"Shene Luhot Haberit\".\n\nHe taught that customs should be respected. In the case of the blessing of \"giving strength to the weary\" he writes that one does not undo an old custom, and believed that opponents like Rabbi Yosef Karo likely repented of changing \"minhag\" at the end of his life.\n\nDealing with the widespread practice of hiring gentiles to work for the community on the Sabbath, he wrote, \"they allow themselves to hire a Gentile under contract to remove the garbage from the streets, and the Gentile does the work on the Sabbath.\" He assumed that a prior rabbi had approved the action \"and we must conclude that a great rabbi handed down this ruling\" for the sake of the community.\n\nRegarding the universal practice of not giving people who claim to be Kohanim priority in many cases (such as not taking food first) he said it is most likely because modern-day Kohanim do not have any proper proof of their pedigree.\n\nHe taught that \"aliyot\" should be given based on events in congregants' lives, such as marriage, birth and death, rather than always giving it to the scholars.\n\nHe taught that \"women are exempt from counting the \"omer\", since it is a positive time-bound commandment\". Nonetheless, they have already made it obligatory upon themselves.\"\n\nHe held that children can count for a minyan for the Torah reading. Some modern rabbis wish to extrapolate from this opinion to include counting women for a minyan in a Partnership Minyan, while others disagree. This controversial point is discussed in recent responsa.\n\nWhile usually giving his imprimatur to local customs, in the case of the custom to donate firecrackers and fireworks to the synagogue in honour of Simchat Torah, Rabbi Gombiner believed it proof of the effect of allowing boorish commoners to celebrate a scholars' holiday.\n\nThe \"Magen Avraham\" was the subject of a commentary by Samuel Neta HaLevi of Kolin, entitled \"Mahatsit ha-shekel\", \nand another by David Solomon Eibenschutz, entitled \"Levushei Serad\".\n\nR. Yechiel Michel Epstein’s Aruch HaShulchan and R. Yisrael Meir Kagan’s Mishnah Berurah relied on Gombiner for their acceptance of Kabbalistic practices.\n\nThere is a major dispute in the 17-18th century as to how to figure Rabbinic hours of the day. \nOne approach (that of Gombiner, in his \"Magen Avraham\") reckons the day from dawn until nightfall.\nThe other approach (that of the Vilna Gaon) reckons the day from sunrise to sunset.\nFor rituals, which are prescribed in the morning, Magen Avraham's calculations will always be earlier than that of the Vilna Gaon. For rituals, which are prescribed in the afternoon or evening, Magen Avraham's calculations will always be later than that of the Vilna Gaon.\n\n\n"}

He was admitted to the bar in 1893, and practiced law in Salina for several years before moving to Kansas City, Kansas in 1900.\n\nFour years later he was the Democratic nominee for Wyandotte County, losing in a close election. He won the office two years later, and was re-elected in 1908 and 1910. He was elected in 1911 to the U.S. House of Representatives, filling a vacancy caused by the death of Alexander C.

Today, it is a historical museum known as Victoria Settlement.\n\nVictoria was located on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River, downstream from Edmonton House on the way to Fort Pitt, and also along the overland route between the two, part of the Carlton Trail system. The fur trading post at Victoria was minor compared to Edmonton but soon attracted a small agricultural settlement around itself much like that at other H.B.C. posts at this time. Here land was divided in the customary French river lot system and a mixed community of First Nations, Métis, and Europeans developed. For several miles on each side of the present-day museum the river lot system is still in use, the farm here predating the large, square tracts of the \"Dominion Lands Act\" which surround them.\n\nThe Victoria Park Cemetery was established circa 1896 by the Methodist church and is located on a hill overlooking the river, it contains approximately 100 recognizable graves from both Native and Settler communities. It was restored and rededicated in 1999.\n\nIn 1864 George Flett was given the job of opening a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in Fort Victoria.\nFlett and John Norris led the first brigade of Red River ox-carts from Winnipeg to Edmonton, taking three and a half months on the journey.\nAs clerk in charge of the post, Flett was responsible for arranging for construction of the buildings and for opening up trade with the local Indians.\nFlett was successful in quickly obtaining a supply of good-quality furs, which Flett and his assistants took by horse and dog train to Fort Edmonton.\nThe oldest building in Alberta still on its original foundations is the clerk's quarters at Fort Victoria, which dates from 1865.\n\nLater the site of the Fort became a hub for the early settlement of East-Central Alberta. It came to be called the Victoria Settlement and later, Pakan. It also became home for the McDougall Presbyterian missionary family. Still later, the settlement served as a base for Methodist missionaries to the Ukrainian Canadians.\n\nThe post was also a vital stop on the trail from Winnipeg to Edmonton. The section of the trail currently within the eastern part of the city of Edmonton is a now a paved road called Victoria Trail in honour of the fort.\n\nThe Fort lies within the larger Victoria District, as well as the Kalyna Country ecomuseum. It has been designated a national historic site of Canada, a provincial historic site of Alberta, as well as municipally designated by Smoky Lake County. The museum that is there today is operated by the province through Alberta Environment and Parks.\n\nFort Victoria and the Victoria Park Cemetery is situated within the larger geographic space of the Victoria District, which itself is currently one of twenty-three national historic sites in Alberta; only three, including the Victoria District, are north of Edmonton. Of these sites, the Victoria District is the only rural national historic site in Alberta.\n\n\nThe Museum at Fort Victoria is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1931660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931660", "title": "An Answer Can Be Found", "text": "An Answer Can Be Found\n\nAn Answer Can Be Found is the third studio album by American heavy metal band CKY. Recorded at studios in California and New York City, it was produced by guitarist Chad I Ginsburg and released on June 28, 2005, by Island Records in North America and Mercury Records in Europe. The album reached number 35 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, the highest position achieved by the band to date.\n\nOriginally named \"The Butcher's Hand\", \"An Answer Can Be Found\" was written by vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller with assistance from Ginsburg, and featured a number of songs from early in the band's career. Again, the album featured the core lineup of Miller, Ginsburg and drummer Jess Margera, with Miller and Ginsburg playing bass on the record in addition to guitars and vocals.\n\nAt the time of its release, \"An Answer Can Be Found\" was presented by CKY's members as the band's \"magnum opus\"; however, the album received mixed reviews from music critics, who offered contrasting views on whether the band's music had evolved or not. \"Familiar Realm\" was released as a single on May 24, 2005, reaching number 32 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nRecording for \"An Answer Can Be Found\" took place at 4th Street Recording in Santa Monica, California, Paramount Recording in Hollywood, California, and Sony Music Studios in New York City, New York; sequencing, editing and mastering took place at Masterdisk in New York City. Recording began on April 7, 2004. Production and mixing were handled by guitarist Chad I Ginsburg, with Pablo Arraya assisting with engineering, Roger Lian working on sequencing and editing with Ginsburg, and Howie Weinberg mastering the album.\n\nAs was the case with the band's previous releases, many of the album's songs were written and recorded in the form of demos years before its release. \"Behind the Screams\" was originally recorded for a bonus feature in the 2003 film \"\", directed by Bam Margera, and was re-recorded for \"An Answer Can Be Found\" as a response to fan requests. Also, \"Don't Hold Your Breath\" originates from the \"Volume 1\" era of the band, but \"never really fit anywhere until [\"An Answer Can Be Found\"] was made\". The title of \"Behind the Screams\" is a play on words, referring to both the presence of the song on a behind the scenes feature on the \"Haggard\" DVD release and the fact that the song comes after \"Tripled Manic State\", which ends with a scream.\n\nAfter songwriting on \"Volume 1\" was credited solely to vocalist Deron Miller, and songwriting on \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" was credited to Miller, Ginsburg and drummer Jess Margera, \"An Answer Can Be Found\" credited Miller and Ginsburg for writing. The album is the first to feature a guest musician, in the form of Jena Kraus who performed additional vocals on \"The Way You Lived\".\n\nUpon completion of the album, Miller assured fans that the band had created \"the best rock record of 2005\", praising both Ginsburg and Margera for their contributions to the release. \"Familiar Realm\" was the only single released from the album, reaching number 32 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart, although \"Tripled Manic State\" was included on a free split release with The Bronx released by \"Fat City\" magazine in May 2006. \"As the Tables Turn\" was featured on the 2005 video game \"Burnout Revenge\".\n\nIn promotion of the album, CKY joined the 2005 Rock Adio Tour, sponsored by skateboarding company Adio Footwear, alongside Fireball Ministry and The Knives. The tour ran throughout North America between August and September 2005, and included a headline performance at the festival Skate Fest in Worcester, Massachusetts. Following the Rock Adio Tour, the band toured in the UK with Clutch, and later supported Avenged Sevenfold on the Cities of Evil Tour between January and February 2006. The group also performed on NBC show \"Last Call with Carson Daly\" on November 11, 2005, performing the songs \"Suddenly Tragic\" and \"Tripled Manic State\".\n\n\"An Answer Can Be Found\" was the last CKY album to be released by Island, as the band left the label in 2006.\n\nMiller claimed in October 2015 that a new lineup of CKY (dubbed \"Mecha CKY\") would be re-recording and re-releasing the album.\n\nCKY's third studio album was originally planned to be titled \"The Butcher's Hand\", which is a lyric from the song \"As the Tables Turn\"; this was later changed to the final title, \"An Answer Can Be Found\", which is a lyric from the album's opening track, \"Suddenly Tragic\".\n\nThe artwork for the album cover, produced by t42design, features the letter \"A\" in the background as a tribute to the band's fanbase, which is affectionately dubbed the \"Alliance\" and was described on the band's website as \"ultra loyal\".\n\nMany of the lyrics on \"An Answer Can Be Found\" include references to suicide, in particular renouncing the idea, with the songs \"Suddenly Tragic\", \"The Way You Lived\" and \"Don't Hold Your Breath\" all said to relate to this theme. Gigwise described the album's lyrics as \"angry yet positive\". The lyrics of \"Tripled Manic State\" are about the idea of experimenting on humans, and the song is a sequel to \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" track \"Inhuman Creation Station\", which was written about a hypothetical factory which manufactured humans. \"Familiar Realm\" is said to be about feelings of \"frustration and ennui\", with \"Billboard\" magazine proposing these themes being felt by band members in relation to CKY's \"growing fame\".\n\nThe music of \"An Answer Can Be Found\" has been compared to that of previous album \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\", but has also been identified as an evolution from the 2002 release. AllMusic's Rob Theakston noted that the album followed much of the same formula as the band's previous album, but claimed that it is \"more heavy metal than it is punk\", identifying the influence of G.G. Allin on the record. \"Alternative Press\" writer Rob Ortenzi highlighted the \"slowed-down death-metal riffs and midtempo backbeat that've become CKY's trademarks\". A review on Blabbermouth.net summarised the album's style as being typified by \"massive riffs, a full-bodied production style, and an interesting combination of stoner esthetics with futuristic leanings\", while Gigwise described it as sounding like \"a cross between Weezer and Stone Temple Pilots with the song sensibilities of Linkin Park\".\n\n\"An Answer Can Be Found\" was the second album released by CKY to register on a music chart, reaching number 35 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 (the band's highest position to date). According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album sold 27,786 copies in the United States in its first week of release. According to Miller, as of August 2015 the album has sold over 153,000 copies, making it the third best-selling CKY album behind \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" and \"Volume 1\".\n\nMedia response to \"An Answer Can Be Found\" was mixed. Ortenzi of \"Alternative Press\" awarded the album a rating of five out of five, claiming that \"Every riff feels precision cut; every melody holds a surprise; every drumbeat knocks the ball into the pocket; and the synth and classical-guitar accents ... serve the songs perfectly\". AllMusic's Theakston was similarly positive in his four-star review, identifying an evolution in the band's sound from previous albums and praising the \"tight\" interplay between Miller and Ginsburg. Blabbermouth.net's review praised \"An Answer Can Be Foud\" for its progression from \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\", guitar riffs, production style and melodic elements. Gigwise applauded the album too, describing it as a \"wonderful album that must be purchased by all immediately\", and highlighting \"Suddenly Tragic\" and \"Tripled Manic State\".\n\nHowever, writing for the magazine \"Exclaim!\", Kendall Shields criticised \"An Answer Can Be Found\" for its lack of progression from \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\", claiming that the band \"barely manage to reiterate, let alone reinvent the suburban skate punk wheel\" on the album. She recognised the attempt at variety on closing track \"Don't Hold Your Breath\", but concluded that the track does not appeal to many outside of the band's core fanbase. The album's review on Blabbermouth.net complained that \"An Answer Can Be Found\" lacks \"one absolutely killer tune\", and also criticsed Miller's vocal performances, which were described as \"limited in range and ... a bit over-produced\". PopMatters writer Lana Cooper claimed that \"An Answer Can Be Found\" is \"knee-deep in dull songs indistinguishable from one another\".\n\nThe album received an infamously negative review from \"Rolling Stone\" writer Jenny Eliscu, who awarded it one star out of five and described it as \"mind-numbing stoner metal, with ginormous power chords, repetitive vocals and overwrought lyrics\". She even went as far as suggesting a listener might want to commit suicide just to \"drown out the sound\" of the album. Miller publicly responded to the review, criticising \"Rolling Stone\" for publishing Eliscu's opinion and suggesting that the critic \"simply isn't intelligent enough to understand\" the lyrics she criticized.\n\nThe feud with \"Rolling Stone\" later escalated, after Miller allegedly posted Eliscu's home telephone number online and CKY fans subsequently harassed and even threatened the journalist. Eliscu complained to the band's label The Island Def Jam Music Group and publicist, while \"Rolling Stone\" defended the writer by retorting that the episode seemed like \"a rather sad attempt to promote a band who should ... rely more on their talent\".\n\n\n"}

The cave lies within the Monumento Natural del Malpaís de La Corona, a protected area of the Canary Islands.\n\nThe cave was created around 3,000 years ago by lava flows erupted from the nearby volcano Monte Corona, flowing across the Malpaís de la Corona toward the sea. As in all lava tubes, the top of a lava stream cooled and developed a solid crust, and the lava stream later drained away leaving the top crust as the roof of a cave.

A: We Are Devo! is the debut studio album by the American new wave band Devo. It was originally released in August 1978 on the Warner Bros. label (Virgin Records in Europe). Produced by Brian Eno, the album was recorded between October 1977 and February 1978, primarily in Cologne, West Germany.\n\nThe album received somewhat mixed reviews from critics and peaked at No. 78 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" chart and No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart. Recent reviews of the album have been more uniformly positive and the album has charted on several retrospective \"best of\" lists from publications including \"Rolling Stone\", Pitchfork Media, and \"Spin\".\n\nOn May 6, 2009, Devo performed the album live in its entirety for the first time as part of the Don't Look Back concert series curated by All Tomorrow's Parties. On September 16, 2009, Warner Bros. and Devo announced a re-release of \"Q: Are We Not Men?\" and \"Freedom of Choice\", with a tour performing both albums.\n\nIn 1977, David Bowie and Iggy Pop received a tape of Devo demo songs from the wife of Michael Aylward, guitarist in another Akron, Ohio band, Tin Huey. Both Pop and Bowie, as well as Brian Eno and Robert Fripp, expressed interest in producing Devo's first release. At Devo's New York debut show in 1977, Bowie proclaimed that \"this is the band of the future, I'm going to produce them in Tokyo this winter.\" Eventually, Eno was chosen to produce the album at Conny Plank's studio located near Cologne, Germany. Bowie was busy with filming \"Just a Gigolo\" but helped Eno produce the record during weekends. Two tracks, \"Come Back Jonee\" and \"Shrivel-Up\", were recorded at Different Fur in San Francisco, California; proprietor Patrick Gleeson co-engineered the album. All tracks were mixed at Plank's studio. Since Devo was without a record deal, Eno paid for the flights and studio cost for the band, confident that the band would be signed to a record contract. In return for his work on the album, Eno asked for a share of any subsequent deals.\n\nThe recording sessions were a source of frustration for Eno and Devo. Eno found the band unwilling to experiment or deviate from their early demonstrations of recorded songs. Devo later admitted that \"we were overtly resistant to Eno's ideas. He made up synth parts and really cool sounds for almost every part of the album, but we used them on three or four songs.\" A majority of the tracks were later remixed by David Bowie; excluding \"Space Junk\", and \"Shrivel Up\", which had Eno's production still intact.\n\nThe phrase \"Are we not men?\" is from \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\" (1896), by H. G. Wells. It is part of the litany of the Law, spoken by the Speaker of the Law to the Beast Folk, creatures surgically force-evolved by the mad doctor.\n\nThe cover was illustrated by Joe Heiner. According to an essay by Devo co-founder and bass guitarist Gerald Casale included on the \"Complete Truth About De-evolution\" DVD, the cover of their debut album is based on an image of the famous professional golfer Juan \"Chi-Chi\" Rodríguez that they had found on a golf strap. According to Casale, David Berman, Senior Vice President of business affairs at their recording company Warner Bros., decided that the image could not be used because \"he was a golf fan and felt we were making fun of Chi Chi.\" The band offered to contact Rodriguez personally but had time constraints, due to the forthcoming production of their album. The manager of the company's art department, Rick Serini, recommended an artist who could airbrush and alter the face of the picture, while lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh offered a picture he'd procured from a local newspaper that morphed the faces of U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. These ideas were later morphed with the original \"Chi Chi\" Rodriguez image to create the cover art of the album.\n\nThe band did eventually get Rodriguez's permission to use the original photograph. Since the \"morphed\" album sleeves were already in production by that time, Serini claimed it would cost the band $2,500 to halt production and reinstate the image intended originally by the band, which forced the band to keep the morphed version. According to Casale, \"we were able to come out with something that by the corporate interference and misunderstanding of the business side of Warner Bros. Records, actually unwittingly produced something far more Devo than the original [image].\" The original cover illustration, with Rodriguez's face intact, turned up on the picture sleeve for the band's third single \"Be Stiff\".\n\nThe European version has a completely different artwork, consisting of two photographs similar to the stills on the American version's inner sleeve (front cover: man with goggles, bow tie, and rubber gloves, back cover: heads with sunglasses under nylon stockings).\n\nA history of the design of the sleeve is presented in an episode of the podcast '99% Invisible'. Episode 328 – 'Devolutionary Design' contains interviews with members of the band, Chi-Chi Rodriguez and representatives of the record industry from the time.\n\nDevo received offers to release \"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\" from Warner Bros., Island, Virgin and David Bowie's production company Bewlay Brothers. Virgin obtained rights to release the album in the United Kingdom, while Warner Bros. held the rights for North America. The album was released in the United States on August 28, 1978 and in the\nUnited Kingdom on September 1, 1978. Virgin also released a picture disc version of the album, illustrated with a still from the band's 1976 music film \"The Truth About De-Evolution\".\n\nIn North America, \"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\" peaked at No. 78 on the Billboard charts, while in the United Kingdom it entered the charts on September 16, 1978 and remained there for seven weeks, peaking at No. 12. \"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\" was also successful in Japan. The album went \"gold\" in the United States on and \"silver\" in the United Kingdom on January 15, 1979.\n\nThe album's opening track, \"Uncontrollable Urge\", has been used in several films and television shows, including; The Wolf of Wall Street, Fun with Dick and Jane, and Jackass.\n\nInitial critical reaction to \"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\" was somewhat mixed. Tom Carson, writing in \"Rolling Stone\", claimed that \"There's not an ounce of feeling anywhere, and the only commitment is to the distancing aesthetic of the put-on\", and opined that \"Devo lacks most of Eno's warmth and much of Bowie's flair for mechanized melodrama. For all its idiosyncrasies, the music here is utterly impersonal.\" Critic Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" gave the album a positive rating of a B+, but noted, \"In small doses it's as good as novelty music ever gets, and there isn't a really bad cut on this album. But it leads nowhere.\" Nonetheless, it was voted one of the best albums of the year in the \"Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1978. In January 1980, \"Trouser Press\" also named it one of the best albums of 1978.\n\nLater reception of the album has been more uniformly positive. Steve Huey of the online music database AllMusic scored the album four and a half \"stars\" terming it \"arguably Devo's strongest set of material, though several brilliant peaks can overshadow the remainder\", and \"a seminal touchstone in the development of American new wave.\" \"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\" has scored on several \"best of\" lists, including \"Spin\"s 50 Most Essential Punk Records, Pitchfork Media's top 100 albums of the 1970s and \"Rolling Stone\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nIt is also listed in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nTo support the album, Devo undertook a lengthy world tour lasting from October 1978 to June 1979. The look of the tour was largely based around the live act they'd been developing throughout the previous year, with the only differences being the increased budget allowing for higher quality costumes and a basic set, and a focus on the album's material, whilst teasing then unreleased songs for the next album.\n\nThe show would open with 2 short films, the band's 1976 \"The Truth About Devolution\" film, followed by their 1978 \"Satisfaction\" and \"Come Back Jonee\" films. When the band arrived on stage Mark Mothersbaugh would appear with a modified electric guitar, which would only be used for the first two songs, \"Satisfaction\", and \"Too Much Paranoias.\" \n\nAs the show would continue, the group's signature yellow suits would be gradually torn, until \"Jocko Homo,\" where Devo would strip down to black shorts and T shirts with knee and shoulder pads. During the intro to \"Smart Patrol\" the group donned orange helmets, which were shaken off during the next song, \"Mr. DNA.\" The show was ultimately concluded with lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh becoming Booji Boy and singing two songs, \"Red Eye\" and \"The Words Get Stuck In My Throat.\"\n\nOn the European version the second song appears as \"Satisfaction (I Can't Get Me No)\".\nDevo\n\nProduction\n\nThe song \"Uncontrollable Urge\" has been covered by numerous bands, among them SNFU for the tribute compilation \"We Are Not Devo\".\n\nIndie rock band Claw Hammer covered the album in its entirety on their 1991 release \"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are NOT Devo!\"\n\nRob Dyrdek covered the song \"Uncontrollable Urge\" as the theme for the MTV Show \"Ridiculousness\".\n\n"}

As a result, the trace of the stress tensor must vanish for a conformally invariant theory. In the presence of a conformal anomaly the trace of the stress tensor can nevertheless acquire a non-vanishing expectation. For this reason, a conformal anomaly is sometimes also called a trace anomaly.\n\nIn string theory, conformal symmetry on the worldsheet is a local Weyl symmetry and the anomaly must therefore cancel if the theory is to be consistent. The required cancellation implies that the spacetime dimensionality must be equal to the critical dimension which is either 26 in the case of bosonic string theory or 10 in the case of superstring theory. This case is called \"critical string theory\". There are alternative approaches known as \"non-critical string theory\" in which the space-time dimensions can be less than 26 for the bosonic theory or less than 10 for the superstring \"i.e.\" the four-dimensional case is plausible within this context. However, some intuitive postulates like flat space being a valid background, need to be given up.\n\nIn quantum chromodynamics in the chiral limit, the classical theory has no mass scale so there is a conformal symmetry, but this is broken by a conformal anomaly. This introduces a scale, which is the scale at which colour confinement occurs. This determines the sizes and masses of hadrons, including protons and neutrons. Hence this effect is responsible for most of the mass of ordinary matter. (In fact the quarks have non-zero masses, so the classical theory does have a mass scale. However, the masses are small so it is still nearly conformal, so there is still a conformal anomaly. The mass due to the conformal anomaly is much greater than the up, down and strange quark masses, so it has a much greater effect on the masses of hadrons.)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1931707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931707", "title": "Critical dimension", "text": "Critical dimension\n\nIn the renormalization group analysis of phase transitions in physics, a critical dimension is the dimensionality of space at which the character of the phase transition changes. Below the lower critical dimension there is no phase transition. Above the upper critical dimension the critical exponents of the theory become the same as that in mean field theory. An elegant criterion to obtain the critical dimension within mean field theory is due to V. Ginzburg.\n\nSince the renormalization group sets up a relation between a phase transition and a quantum field theory, this has implications for the latter and for our larger understanding of renormalization in general. Above the upper critical dimension, the quantum field theory which belongs to the model of the phase transition is a free field theory. Below the lower critical dimension, there is no field theory corresponding to the model.\n\nIn the context of string theory the meaning is more restricted: the \"critical dimension\" is the dimension at which string theory is consistent assuming a constant dilaton background without additional confounding permutations from background radiation effects. The precise number may be determined by the required cancellation of conformal anomaly on the worldsheet; it is 26 for the bosonic string theory and 10 for superstring theory.\n\nDetermining the upper critical dimension of a field theory is a matter of linear algebra. It is worthwhile to formalize the procedure because it yields the lowest-order approximation for scaling and essential input for the renormalization group. It also reveals conditions to have a critical model in the first place.\n\nA Lagrangian may be written as a sum of terms, each consisting of an integral over a monomial of coordinates formula_1 and fields formula_2. Examples are the standard formula_3-model and the isotropic Lifshitz tricritical point with Lagrangians\n\nsee also the figure on the right.\nThis simple structure may be compatible with a scale invariance under a rescaling of the\ncoordinates and fields with a factor formula_6 according to\nTime is not singled out here — it is just another coordinate: if the Lagrangian contains a time variable then this variable is to be rescaled as formula_8 with some constant exponent formula_9. The goal is to determine the exponent set formula_10.\n\nOne exponent, say formula_11, may be chosen arbitrarily, for example formula_12. In the language of dimensional analysis this means that the exponents formula_13 count wave vector factors (a reciprocal length formula_14). Each monomial of the Lagrangian thus leads to a homogeneous linear equation formula_15 for the exponents formula_13. If there are formula_17 (inequivalent) coordinates and fields in the Lagrangian, then formula_17 such equations constitute a square matrix. If this matrix were invertible then there only would be the trivial solution formula_19.\n\nThe condition formula_20 for a nontrivial solution gives an equation between the space dimensions, and this determines the upper critical dimension formula_21 (provided there is only one variable dimension formula_22 in the Lagrangian). A redefinition of the coordinates and fields now shows that determining the scaling exponents formula_13 is equivalent to a dimensional analysis with respect to the wavevector formula_24, with all coupling constants occurring in the Lagrangian rendered dimensionless. Dimensionless coupling constants are the technical hallmark for the upper critical dimension.\n\nNaive scaling at the level of the Lagrangian does not directly correspond to physical scaling because a cutoff is required to give a meaning to the field theory and the path integral. Changing the length scale also changes the number of degrees of freedom.\nThis complication is taken into account by the renormalization group. The main result at the upper critical dimension is that scale invariance remains valid for large factors formula_6, but with additional formula_26 factors in the scaling of the coordinates and fields.\n\nWhat happens below or above formula_21 depends on whether one is interested in long distances (statistical field theory) or short distances (quantum field theory). Quantum field theories are trivial (convergent) below formula_21 and not renormalizable above formula_21. Statistical field theories are trivial (convergent) above formula_21 and renormalizable below formula_21. In the latter case there arise \"anomalous\" contributions to the naive scaling exponents formula_13. These anomalous contributions to the effective critical exponents vanish at the upper critical dimension.\n\nIt is instructive to see how the scale invariance at the upper critical dimension becomes a scale invariance below this dimension. For small external wave vectors the vertex functions formula_33 acquire additional exponents, for example formula_34. If these exponents are inserted into a matrix formula_35 (which only has values in the first column) the condition for scale invariance becomes formula_36. This equation only can be satisfied if the anomalous exponents of the vertex functions cooperate in some way. In fact, the vertex functions depend on each other hierarchically. One way to express this interdependence are the Dyson-Schwinger equations.\n\nNaive scaling at formula_21 thus is important as zeroth order approximation. Naive scaling at the upper critical dimension also classifies terms of the Lagrangian as relevant, irrelevant or marginal. A Lagrangian is compatible with scaling if the formula_1- and formula_2 -exponents formula_40 lie on a hyperplane, for examples see the figure above. formula_13 is a normal vector of this hyperplane.\n\nThe lower critical dimension formula_42 of a phase transition of a given universality class is the last dimension for which this phase transition does not occur if the dimension is increased starting with formula_43.\n\nThermodynamic stability of an ordered phase depends on entropy and energy. Quantitatively this depends on the type of domain walls and their fluctuation modes. There appears to be no generic formal way for deriving the lower critical dimension of a field theory. Lower bounds may be derived with statistical mechanics arguments.\n\nConsider first a one-dimensional system with short range interactions. Creating a domain wall requires a fixed energy amount formula_44. Extracting this energy from other degrees of freedom decreases entropy by formula_45. This entropy change must be compared with the entropy of the domain wall itself. In a system of length formula_46 there are formula_47 positions for the domain wall, leading (according to Boltzmann's principle) to an entropy gain formula_48. For nonzero temperature formula_49 and formula_46 large enough the entropy gain always dominates, and thus there is no phase transition in one-dimensional systems with short-range interactions at formula_51. Space dimension formula_52 thus is a lower bound for the lower critical dimension of such systems.\n\nA stronger lower bound formula_53 can be derived with the help of similar arguments for systems with short range interactions and an order parameter with a continuous symmetry. In this case the Mermin-Wagner-Theorem states that the order parameter expectation value vanishes in formula_54 at formula_51, and there thus is no phase transition of the usual type at formula_53 and below.\n\nFor systems with quenched disorder a criterion given by Imry and Ma might be relevant. These authors used the criterion to determine the lower critical dimension of random field magnets.\n\n"}

It is the fourth value-priced resort in the complex, following Disney's All-Star Movies, All-Star Music, and All-Star Sports Resorts in the 1990s. The resort is themed around 20th century American pop culture. Original plans anticipated the creation of both the \"Legendary Years\" and the \"Classic Years\" to divide the property by the first and second halves of the century, respectively. However, the former section was closed after reduced tourism in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and redeveloped as a fifth value-priced resort, Disney's Art of Animation Resort, in 2012.\n\nAfter achieving international success with existing accommodations, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts began construction of the first value-priced resorts at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The three-resort complex opened during the 1990s, consisting of Disney's All-Star Movies, All-Star Music, and All-Star Sports Resorts. The properties proved themselves as successful investments, leading to the development of a fourth value-priced resort in 1999. The resort was originally planned to open in 2001, though the opening was eventually delayed to March 2002. It was delayed once more before accepting reservations on April 22, 2003, and opening on December 14, 2003.\nThe original plans for the resort included a second phase of units themed to the \"Legendary Years\", which would have included 1900 – 1940s themed buildings. These rooms would have resided across a lake from the \"Classic Years\" section, and would be connected by the 'Generation Gap' bridge to that section. Construction for both phases were started at the same time, but after the September 11 attacks, Disney scaled back the hotel due to the reduction in tourism.\n\nThe \"Classic Years\" section opened in 2003, while the \"Legendary Years\" lobby building (to be called \"Legendary Hall\") plus several of its buildings were left uncompleted. Initially, the completed resort was to have an additional 2,880 rooms on the \"Legendary\" side, configured identically to the \"Classic\" side. The parking lot for the expansion was completed during the earlier phase of construction, and occasionally was used as overflow parking for the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. The fact that the \"Legendary Years\" was never opened has led to people calling the Pop Century the \"Pop Half-Century Resort\", since only the 1950s - 1990s are featured.\n\nOn May 12, 2010, Disney Parks announced plans to complete the remaining section of the resort as a separate, value-priced resort known as Disney's Art of Animation Resort. It is based on four of Disney and Pixar's most popular films: \"The Little Mermaid\", \"The Lion King\", \"Finding Nemo\", and \"Cars\". However, to distinguish it from Pop Century, the hotel has 1,120 suites, designed for up to six people. The remaining 864 rooms are standard value-resort size. The addition of suites was based on positive guest responses after a number of hotel rooms at Disney's All-Star Music Resort were combined to form larger accommodations. Construction resumed in the summer of 2010, and the resort opened in May 2012.\n\nIn 2017, Disney's Pop Century Resort began a massive refurbishment which included the addition of queen-sized beds (one of which is a Murphy-style bed), hard surface floors, and a small refrigerator. That process was complete in the summer of 2018. \n\nEach themed area features motel-style buildings adorned with larger-than-life phrases and iconography of the decade being represented. The resort has 2,880 rooms in ten separate buildings, three pool areas, and one central building, named \"Classic Hall\", that houses the front desk, gift shop, arcade, and food court. The buildings are four-story versions of the three-story All Star Resort buildings.\n\nWhen the \"Legendary Years\" buildings were first being made, a bridge originally named the Generation Gap Bridge was constructed to connect both parts of Pop Century and made them accessible to each other. The bridge, today unnamed, connects Pop Century to the \"Finding Nemo\" section of the Art of Animation Resort. This bridge contains a terminal for the Disney Skyliner aerial gondola system.\n\nIn the \"Classic Years\" section of the resort, each area is themed with a specific decade and giant items related to that decade. This was originally one of two planned construction phases for the resort, but has become the only completed area of the resort due to a scaling-back of the project.\n\n1950s\n\n1960s\n1970s\n\n1980s\n1990s\nDisney Transport buses provide scheduled service between the resort hotel and the theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs. The resort has laundry facilities and babysitting options available. It also has pizza delivery to guests' rooms as well as cable television. As of April 2012 refrigerators and internet access are now complimentary.\n\nThe hotel has several shopping and dining locations, including the following:\n\n"}

He was appointed by Reinhard Heydrich to head department Amt VII, Written Records of the \"Reichssicherheitshauptamt\" (RSHA). In 1940, he was appointed to direct state police operations in an occupied Great Britain following invasion. \n\nIn the post-war period, he worked as a public relations executive and a management consultant.\n\nFranz Six completed his classical high school in 1930, and proceeded to the University of Heidelberg to study journalism, sociology and politics. His late graduation was due to the fact he had to drop out of school from time to time to earn the money needed to graduate. He graduated with a degree of doctor in philosophy in 1934. In 1936, Six earned the high degree of doctor, and became a professor of journalism at the University of Königsberg where he also took up the position of press director for the German Student's Association. By 1939, he had become chair for Foreign Political Science at the University of Berlin and was its first dean of the faculty for foreign countries.\n\nSix joined the Nazi Party in 1930 with member number 245,670 and the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) in 1932, for whom he was a student organizer. Six joined the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD) in 1935 and his SS membership number was 107,480. Impressed by his academic achievements and outstanding curriculum, Reinhard Heydrich appointed him as head of Amt VII, Written Records of the RSHA which dealt mainly with ideological tasks. These included the creation of anti-semitic, anti-masonic propaganda, the sounding of public opinion and monitoring of Nazi indoctrination by the public. He held this post until 1943 when he was succeeded by Paul Dittel.\n\nOn 17 September 1940, the same day on which Hitler indefinitely postponed the idea of an invasion of Great Britain, Heydrich charged Six to plan the elimination of anti-Nazi elements in Britain following a successful invasion by the Wehrmacht. Six was intended to become the SD-Commander in the country, with his headquarters to be in located in London, and with regional task forces in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, and Edinburgh. His immediate mission would have been to hunt down and arrest some 2,820 people listed in the \"Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.\" (\"Special Search List Great Britain\"). This document, which post-war became known as \"The Black Book\", was a secret list previously compiled by Walter Schellenberg, Chief of Amt VI, \"Ausland-SD\", that made up the foreign intelligence branch of the SD. The list contained the names of prominent British residents to be arrested immediately after a successful invasion. Some people on the list included British politicians, such as Winston Churchill and other members of the Cabinet, writers like Sigmund Freud (even though he had died in September 1939), the philosopher Bertrand Russell, members of exiled governments, financiers such as Bernard Baruch and many other anti-Nazi elements. A separate list also named many organizations which would have to be dismantled as well, namely the Freemasons, the Jehovah's Witnesses and even the Boy Scouts. Six would also have been responsible for handling the over 300,000 large population of British Jews.\n\nAfter Hitler gave up on his attempts to invade Great Britain and Six's planned role never being realized, Six was on 20 June 1941 assigned as chief of \"Vorkommando Moscow\", a unit of \"Einsatzgruppe B\" in the Soviet Union. During this command, Six's Kommando reported \"liquidating\" 144 persons. The report claimed \"The Vorkommando Moscow was forced to execute another 46 persons, amongst them 38 intellectual Jews who had tried to create unrest and discontent in the newly established Ghetto of Smolensk.\" He was promoted by Heinrich Himmler on 9 November 1941 to \"SS-Oberführer\" for exceptional service in the \"Einsatz\". On 31 January 1945, he was again promoted to \"SS-Brigadeführer\". \n\nAfter the war Six was tried as a war criminal in the \"Einsatzgruppen Trial\" at Nuremberg in the of 1948. Unable to link him directly to any atrocities, the Nuremberg tribunal sentenced him to 20 years' imprisonment. A clemency court commuted this sentence to 10 years, and he was released on 30 September 1952. He served about 7.5 years from his arrest to his release- about 13.5 days for each of his 200 victims. CIA files suggest Six joined the Gehlen Organization, the forerunner to the \"Bundesnachrichtendienst\", in the 1950s.\n\nFranz Six retired to Friedrichshafen in southern Germany. He worked as a publicity/advertising executive for Porsche.\n\nSix was called as one of four witnesses by defense attorney Robert Servatius in the 1961 trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann, and gave his testimony by deposition in West Germany. Servatius had wanted to have Six appear in person, but Prosecutor Gideon Hausner stated that the former Nazi general would be subject to arrest as a war criminal. Six's testimony was introduced in Eichmann's defense, but proved to be of more help to the prosecution.\n\nFranz Six died in 1975.\n"}

The lyrics were written by Pasteur Rahajason and the music by Norbert Raharisoa. It is similar to a march and was strongly influenced by European music and the French colonial education system It is often played by Malagasy musicians on the accordion. The anthem was officially adopted on April 27, 1959 by the parliament of Madagascar prior to the official granting of independence on 26 June 1960. Philibert Tsiranana was Prime Minister of Madagascar during the creation of the anthem and Michel Debré was the French Prime Minister during this time. The main focus of the anthem is love of the land, as well as thankfulness to God and an appeal to unity and loyalty under the nation.\n\n\"Pastor\" Rahajason is credited with writing the national anthem of Madagascar. He was a priest born in 1897 and died in 1971. He was influenced by the French colonial education system, the aim of which was to assimilate the colonized people and was part of the broader civilizing mission. This system was designed to orient local Malagasy populations towards the French colonial project, promoting strong ties to the French language, as well as French civilization, values, and cultural preferences. The schools were often associated with various missionary organizations, imparting a strong religious education overtone, also accounting for Rahajason's exposure to Christianity and his subsequent decision to become a pastor.\n\nNorbert Raharisoa is credited with composing the national anthem of Madagascar. Raharisoa was also a music teacher and professor. He was born in 1914 and died in 1963, shortly following the adoption of his composition. He was honoured for his contributions to Malagasy culture by being featured on the 40 franc postage stamp in 1967. Like his colleague Rahajason, Norbert Raharisoa was raised under the French colonial education system, which explains the colonial influence on the anthem.\n\nPhilibert Tsiranana, the Prime Minister of Madagascar during the independence talks with France, was content to remain within the broader influence of the French, including the franc zone. He wanted to ask for an independent ability to conduct diplomatic relations, allowing France to continue its role in other aspects of governance such as defense.\n\nMichel Debré was the French Prime Minister during this time.\n\nThe anthem is written as a European-style march, consistent with many national anthems around the world. The march is traditionally a military style, with a strong and even beat, originally meant to help troops \"march\" in step while traveling.\n\nThe anthem betrays its colonial influence through the general absence of local musical styles and instrument types. Ron Emoff, professor of music and anthropology at OSU Newark, notes that the anthem is not played in the \"vakondra-zana\" style, which is the style of the ancestors' music, also known as a form of traditional music. Emoff also notes that the anthem is usually not played on the local instrument, the \"valiha\"\".\" This is because the anthem replicates the same essential ingredients that European hymns use, which are themselves based on old religious and nationalistic hymns.\n\nThe national anthem of Madagascar was officially adopted on April 27, 1959, approximately one year before Madagascar achieved independence from the French, on June 26, 1960. The song was originally written in French and Malagasy, an Austronesian language, indicating both the influence of the French colonizers and the prominence of Austronesian immigration to Madagascar.\n\nAnthems are meant to be hymns to the nation, celebrating important national traditions, goals, and histories and Madagascar's anthem follows this tradition well. They are meant to create a strong sense of national unity and nationalism, and in nations like Madagascar, they are designed to supersede ethnic affiliations.\n\nResearcher Igor Cusack identified several themes under which national anthems generally fall: calls to awake, arise, or work for future progress; praise for what's already there; and/ or thanks to God. Cusack defines anthems as essentially praise hymns to God, the nation, or a parental figure, in keeping with the European origin of anthems as hymns. Writing about Madagascar, Cusack explains that it was influenced by its French colonial masters, and featured the themes: blessed by God, God save our land/people, and a nonspecific love of their beloved land.\n\nThe anthem is officially written in both French (the colonial language) and Malagasy (the predominant local Austronesian language). This is because prior to Madagascar being conquered by the French in 1896, the island was already home to many different people groups, beginning with the arrival of Austronesians in AD 350. African migrants came from AD 1000 and onwards, as well as other smaller groups, making Madagascar a very diverse nation and explaining the emphasis in the anthem of uniting as a nation based on the beauty of the land rather than a specific ethnic identity. In all, the people of Madagascar were influenced by Austronesian, French, Indian, Arab, and African cultural and religious practices.\n\nAlthough the independence movement in Madagascar can be traced back to the nationalist attacks against the French in late March 1947, it is officially credited to the successful referendum vote in 1958 and the founding of the Malagasy Republic on October 14, 1958. They were officially granted independence from France on June 20, 1960 and became known as the Republic of Madagascar.\n\nBased on the themes provided by Igor Cusack, the Madagascar anthem strongly demonstrates elements of \"blessed by God\", \"God save our land/people\", and a \"love of their beloved land\".\n\n"}

He worked at \"The Wall Street Journal\" for 39 years, retiring as deputy managing editor in 2004. In 2005, he became the second public editor of \"The New York Times\" for a fixed two-year term.\n\nCalame earned a bachelor's degree in journalism at the University of Missouri in 1961 and was awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters honorary degree in 2011. He received a master's degree in political science at the University of Maryland in 1966. He served as an officer in the U.S. Navy from 1961 to 1965.\n\nCalame joined the Journal in 1965 and served as a reporter, bureau chief and editor before being named the deputy managing editor in 1992. \"As deputy managing editor since 1992, Barney has run the entire paper in my absence and much of it in my presence\", Paul Steiger, then the Journal managing editor, said in announcing Calame's retirement at the end of 2004. His responsibilities as deputy managing editor included maintaining the paper's ethical and journalistic standards, and he was \"widely regarded as the conscience of the paper\". His role outside the Journal newsroom, however, was seldom a highly visible one.\n\nHis work at the Journal was recognized by several awards. He received the 2005 Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award, the 2005 New York Financial Writers’ Association Elliott V. Bell Award, and the 2002 Society of American Business Editors and Writers Distinguished Achievement Award.\n\nInvited to become the Times public editor two months after retiring from the Journal, Calame succeeded Daniel Okrent in the ombudsman-like position and was followed by Clark Hoyt. His focus on the nuts-and-bolts of newspapering and journalistic ethics drew sharp criticism, and some observers complained that he pulled his punches and was too restrained in criticizing the newspaper and its staff.\n\nJack Shafer, then the media critic for \"Slate\", declared in a May 2006 commentary that Calame's first year as public editor had been \"dreadful\". He complained \"Calame possesses a mandate that would allow him to boil the journalistic ocean if he so desired, but he usually elects to merely warm a teapot for his readers and pour out thimblefuls of weak chamomile\".\n\nCalame was criticized by both conservatives and liberals. Conservative syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin called Calame \"totally worthless\". Sidney Schanberg, then the media writer for the liberal Village Voice, accused him in 2006 of nitpicking a Times national security article.\n\nSome assessments were more positive. Calame was awarded the 2006 Bart Richards Award for Media Criticism for six of his public editor columns. \"’He was forthright in his examination and was not afraid to say exactly what he thought and to hold the newspaper accountable,’ said Peter Bhatia, a former American Society of News Editors president who was one of the three judges.\n\nAs Calame neared the end of his term, Shafer told the New York Observer: \"I think that Barney has gotten better. He’s not engaging in the ankle-biting behavior he was before. I would give him a B for reversing direction, and getting away from attacking the capillaries\".\n\nCalame severely criticized Judith Miller after the conclusion of the legal maneuvering over her controversial decision to go to jail in 2005 rather than reveal her sources of information. He challenged \"shortcuts\" she had taken in her reporting and concluded \"the problems facing her inside and outside the newsroom will make it difficult for her to return to the paper as a reporter\". His views were hotly contested by Miller and her supporters, who contended that Calame was acting more like a management representative than an independent thinker.\n\nHe revealed that an April 9, 2006, The New York Times Magazine cover story by Jack Hitt had asserted—without checking the trial record—that a woman in El Salvador had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for having an abortion; in fact, she had been convicted of murdering a newborn baby. Calame criticized two assistant managing editors who refused to retract letters to readers insisting the story was accurate—after being told of the true verdict—and refused run a correction in the paper until the outcry that developed after his column appeared.\n\nA January 1, 2006 column accused Times executive editor, Bill Keller, and publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., of \"stonewalling\" for refusing to answer Calame's questions about how long Keller had held up publication of a December 16, 2005, story about National Security Agency classified wiretapping programs. Eight months later, Keller acknowledged to Calame that the story had been held up before the 2004 presidential election and longer than the one year stated in the original article.\n\n"}

In electrostatics, the energy required to assemble the charge distribution takes the form of self-energy by bringing in the constituent charges from infinity, where the electric force goes to zero. In a condensed matter context relevant to electrons moving in a material, the self-energy represents the potential felt by the electron due to the surrounding medium's interactions with it. Since electrons repel each other the moving electron polarizes, or causes to displace, the electrons in its vicinity and then changes the potential of the moving electron fields. These and other effects entail self-energy. \n\nMathematically, this energy is equal to the so-called on mass shell value of the proper self-energy \"operator\" (or proper mass \"operator\") in the momentum-energy representation (more precisely, to formula_2 times this value). In this, or other representations (such as the space-time representation), the self-energy is pictorially (and economically) represented by means of Feynman diagrams, such as the one shown below. In this particular diagram, the three arrowed straight lines represent particles, or particle propagators, and the wavy line a particle-particle interaction; removing (or \"amputating\") the left-most and the right-most straight lines in the diagram shown below (these so-called \"external\" lines correspond to prescribed values for, for instance, momentum and energy, or four-momentum), one retains a contribution to the self-energy operator (in, for instance, the momentum-energy representation). Using a small number of simple rules, each Feynman diagram can be readily expressed in its corresponding algebraic form.\n\nIn general, the on-the-mass-shell value of the self-energy operator in the momentum-energy representation is complex. In such cases, it is the real part of this self-energy that is identified with the physical self-energy (referred to above as particle's \"self-energy\"); the inverse of the imaginary part is a measure for the lifetime of the particle under investigation. For clarity, elementary excitations, or dressed particles (see quasi-particle), in interacting systems are distinct from stable particles in vacuum; their state functions consist of complicated superpositions of the eigenstates of the underlying many-particle system, which only, if at all, momentarily behave like those specific to isolated particles; the above-mentioned lifetime is the time over which a dressed particle behaves as if it were a single particle with well-defined momentum and energy.\n\nThe self-energy operator (often denoted by formula_3, and less frequently by formula_4) is related to the bare and dressed propagators (often denoted by formula_5 and formula_6 respectively) via the Dyson equation (named after Freeman John Dyson):\n\nMultiplying on the left by the inverse formula_8 of the operator formula_9\nand on the right by formula_10 yields\n\nThe photon and gluon do not get a mass through renormalization because gauge symmetry protects them from getting a mass. This is a consequence of the Ward identity. The W-boson and the Z-boson get their masses through the Higgs mechanism; they do undergo mass renormalization through the renormalization of the electroweak theory.\n\nNeutral particles with internal quantum numbers can mix with each other through virtual pair production. The primary example of this phenomenon is the mixing of neutral kaons. Under appropriate simplifying assumptions this can be described without quantum field theory.\n\nIn chemistry, the self-energy or \"Born energy\" of an ion is the energy associated with the field of the ion itself.\n\nIn solid state and condensed-matter physics self-energies and a myriad of related quasiparticle properties are calculated by Green's function methods and Green's function (many-body theory) of interacting low-energy excitations on the basis of electronic band structure calculations. Self-energies also find extensive application in the calculation of particle transport through open quantum systems and the embedding of sub-regions into larger systems (for example the surface of a semi-infinite crystal).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1931774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931774", "title": "Duncan Lee", "text": "Duncan Lee\n\nLt. Col. Duncan Chaplin Lee (1913 – 1988) was confidential assistant to Maj. Gen. William (\"Wild Bill\") Donovan, founder and director of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), World War II-era predecessor of the CIA, during 1942-46. Lee is identified in the Venona project as the Soviet double agent operating inside OSS under the cover name \"Koch,\" making him the most senior alleged source the Soviet Union ever had inside American intelligence.\n\nAs an OSS officer, Lee served as head of the China section of SI, the Secret Intelligence Branch. While an officer, according to Soviet courier Elizabeth Bentley, Lee—reportedly a descendant of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee—covertly furnished her with information on \"anti-Soviet work by OSS\" and other topics of interest to Moscow, which was technically an ally (in Europe) following the collapse of the Nazi-Soviet pact.\n\nIn November 1944, Anatoly Gorsky reported to Moscow that according to Elizabeth Bentley, Mary Price had begun a sexual relationship with one of her sources, Duncan Chaplin Lee. \"(Price) established an intimate relationship with (Lee), and she did not tell us about it until recently.\" Gorsky was concerned that this affair might result in Lee's exposure as a spy because his wife, who was also a member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), knew about his spying. \"(Lee) and (Price) met in two places, at her flat and at his. The meetings were held in the presence of (Lee's) wife, who was aware of her husband's secret work.\" Lee's wife discovered her husband's love affair and complained in a series of jealous scenes. The NKVD became worried about these developments and ordered her to stop serving as his courier.\n\nEarl Browder told Iskhak Akhmerov that Price's \"nerves had been badly shaken\" by these events.\nHowever, as Kathryn S. Olmsted has pointed out: \"Mary Price... continued the love affair, hoping that Lee would divorce his wife and marry her. Distraught over his deteriorating marriage, the pressures of the love affair, and intensified security probes at the OSS, Duncan Lee, by late 1944, had become an extremely reluctant Soviet source. Moreover, he distrusted Elizabeth Bentley, who now acted as his primary courier and contact with Soviet intelligence.\" \n\nAs Bentley told the FBI when she defected in 1945, she transferred this information to her Soviet handlers.\n\nIn her August 1948 appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), Bentley testified that Lee furnished her \"various types of information,\" which she then turned over to her Soviet handlers, including, in Bentley's words, details on \"whether the OSS had spotted any of our people [Communists]\" in that organization. As the Germans were retreating from Eastern Europe and the Balkans, Bentley reported Lee as identifying groups working with the OSS to keep Soviet troops out of their countries. Lee also told her, she said, that \"something very secret was going on\" at Oak Ridge, Tenn., an apparent reference to the Manhattan Project.\n\nLee, a former Rhodes scholar who attended Oxford University with fellow OSS staffer Donald Niven Wheeler (identified in Venona as the Soviet agent operating in OSS under cover name \"Izra\"), repeatedly denied Bentley's allegations, under oath, but acknowledged he and his wife knew Bentley as a family friend (albeit under an assumed name) and that he had met her several times while an OSS officer in various locations, as well as with Mary Price (identified in Venona as the Soviet agent operating in the office of columnist Walter Lippmann under the code names \"Dir\" and \"probably\" \"Arena\"), and veteran NKVD \"rezident\" Jacob Golos, identified in Venona as \"Zvuk\" (\"Sound\"). Lee said he eventually realized that Bentley held \"communistic\" views and terminated their relationship, but never reported these meetings as regulations would seem to require.\n\nLee's testimony elicited from HUAC member Rep. John McDowell (R-Penn.) the comment: For the first time \"since the conspiracy of Aaron Burr, a high officer of the Army has been accused publicly of the violation of the Articles of War, which he must certainly realize the penalties and the punishment.\" Lee was in fact never indicted much less convicted of perjury or any other crime despite the accusations of his alleged co-conspirator Bentley. According to Bentley, Lee refused to meet with her in the presence of others when divulging classified information to her and refused to give her any classified documents; there was as a consequence virtually no credible evidence to corroborate Bentley's accusations. Bentley herself was not an effective witness. Only one of the dozens of people she denounced was ever convicted of any crime arising out of her accusations, but only a few were even prosecuted. Many freely admitted their espionage in public hearings once the statute of limitations had run, and most of those she named were independently proved guilty by the testimony of other eyewitnesses, if not eventually by the Venona files.\n\nThe Venona project decrypts that refer to Koch only confirm that Bentley passed on to Moscow the information she claimed to have received from Lee and do not in themselves provide independent evidence to corroborate Bentley's accusation that Lee was the source of that information. A 1944 Venona decrypt confirms that Lee tipped off Bentley about Donovan sending him on a secret mission to China.\n\nAccording to the Moynihan Commission, \"It would ... appear from the Venona messages that Duncan Chaplin Lee, Special Assistant to OSS Director William J. Donovan, was a Soviet agent.\"\n\nIn a review of Mark A. Bradley's 2014 book \"A Very Principled Boy\", Pete Finn, national security editor at \"The Washington Post\", noted that Lee's insistence on passing on intelligence only orally helped him escape prosecution, \"But the 1995 declassification of decrypted wartime Soviet cables and the release of the notebooks of a former KGB officer who copied sections of Lee’s file in Moscow left little doubt that the blue-blooded Virginian had betrayed his country.\"\n\nLee went on to have a successful career as a lawyer in the private sector. Lee continued to represent clients such as Claire Chennault and Whiting Willaurer. In 1949, following the fall of China to the communists, Lee represented a CIA-front company in the Hong Kong and UK courts in a successful effort to keep a large fleet of transport aircraft in Hong Kong, once owned by the Nationalist Chinese government, from being seized by the new communist Chinese regime after its recognition by the British. Lee joined insurance giant American International Group in 1953, rising to serve as AIG's chief in-house lawyer in New York City prior to his retirement in 1974.\n\nLee subsequently moved to Toronto with his Canadian wife, Frances Lee Smith, where he died in 1988.\n\n\n"}

In it, Palin travelled around the Sahara in Northern and Western Africa, meeting people and visiting places. The journey route included the following countries and territories: Gibraltar, Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Niger, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.\n\nThese countries and the entire Sahara area are vast. For example, Algeria is four times the size of France or three times the size of Texas. The Sahara is roughly the same size as the United States, and the trip covered 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometres) and lasted three months.\n\nA book by the same name written by Palin was published to accompany the series. This book contained both Palin's text and many pictures by Basil Pao, the stills photographer on the team. Basil Pao also produced a separate book of the photographs he took during the journey, \"Inside Sahara\", a large coffee-table style book printed on glossy paper.\n\nThe series consists of four 60-minute episodes, as follows:\n\nThe programme starts in Gibraltar, shown to be a bit of Britain only a few miles from Africa. In Tangier, Morocco, Palin rides a camel on the beach, and then plays football with some youths and hurts himself. He's somewhat revived by visiting a hammam, a public bath house. He attends a church service at St. Andrews Anglican Church together with some Nigerians who are trying to gain access to Europe. He also visits Jonathan Dawson, an expatriate Englishman, and his pet cockerel Birdie.\n\nTo get to the Sahara it is necessary to travel over the Atlas Mountains. Along the way Palin visits Fez and sees the old-fashioned way to dye leather. Then in Marrakesh, he visits the souk (market). In the mountains near Marrakesh Palin visits a Berber village, experiencing a \"courtship dance\". Before leaving the mountains he passes through Ait Benhaddou, an old town used as the location for many movies.\n\nFinally having reached the Sahara, in Algeria, Palin visits the Smara refugee camp for people who fled from Western Sahara. A member of the Polisario Front shows him around and he sees their equipment, mainly old Russian tanks. After several days travel, Palin makes it to Mauritania, to the town of Zouerat. From there he takes the iron ore train south to Choûm, then by road on to Atar, where he encounters the Paris - Dakar rally and talks to Dave Hammond, the only remaining British entrant at that point. In the closing credits, Palin mentions that Hammond had moved up to twelfth position before suffering an injury, from which he slowly recovered.\n\nThe episode starts with Palin crossing the Sénégal River, leaving Mauritania and entering the town of Saint-Louis in Senegal. He has left Arab Africa and entered Black Africa, and the French influence, from the colonial past, is strongly felt here. He interviews the artist Jacob Yakouba and his soap-opera-star wife Marie-Madeleine, talking to them about polygamy, which is prevalent here. Palin also visits Gorée Island, the main departure point for black slaves sold to America.\n\nPalin moves on to Dakar and watches (and takes part in) a late-night wrestling match, and then talks to the owner of a jazz café. Then he takes the Bamako Express train to Bamako in Mali, talking to a native woman about polygamy along the way. In Bamako he talks to the musician Toumani Diabate.\n\nPalin visits the town of Tirelli on the Bandiagara Escarpment where the Dogon people live. The Dogons are a tribe of people who kept themselves isolated from the rest of the world until fairly recently, and have a culture unlike any other. While with the Dogons, Palin experiences getting gunpowder blown into his face from the Dogon hunter's old blunderbuss, eats a meal in a sweltering 56 degree (134 degree F) location, witnesses a funeral dance, and is introduced to the blacksmith, whose secondary job is to circumcise the boys (his wife performs female genital cutting on the girls).\n\nIn Djenne, Palin talks to a local man whose nickname is Pigmy and experiences the Muslim Tabaski ritual of slaughtering a sheep, first at the huge mosque and later at Pigmy's house. At the town of Mopti Palin tries to get ferry passage up the Niger River, but the low water level makes this impossible. Taking a smaller and very primitive boat instead, Palin meets Kristin, a Norwegian Christian missionary who has lived in Mali for six years, and they talk about female genital cutting and Kristin's attempts to convert Muslims to Christianity. Then the boat runs aground, and it is unsure if and when Palin will arrive in Timbuktu.\n\nMichael Palin did make it to the mysterious Timbuktu, and this episode opens with views of the famous mosque built of mud. Palin talks to the imam, who shows Palin documents indicating that Muslim scholars had discovered that the Earth circled the Sun at least 100 years before Europeans figured it out.\n\nAfter this, Palin joins a tribe of Wodaabe nomads on their way to Ingal (in Niger) to participate in the Cure Salée festival. He talks to a young Wodaabe man named Doulla and to Céline, a young French woman who is also following along with the group. The subject of polygamy is again raised, and we see the unusual courting rituals of the Wodaabe. Here the young girls choose the man they would like to try out, while the young men stand in a line dancing and rolling their eyes and looking very feminine (by Western standards) with lots of makeup.\n\nAt Tabelot, Palin visits an oasis, where a camel is used to raise water from a deep well using a long rope and a goatskin bucket. Palin visits the home of Omar and his four wives and 15 children. That evening there is a party before the departure of the camel caravan the next day.\n\nThe rest of the episode follows Palin as he follows the camel caravan on its way across the Tenere Desert, which the French had called \"absolute desert\". There is nothing here but sand, sand, and more sand. Finding a tree is cause for celebration. Palin shares conditions with the camel drivers, walking with them and eating their food. He tries to talk to them, but they speak no English or French, and they end up attempting to teach each other their native languages. \"Bottoms up\" is a favourite expression. After five days, Palin leaves the camel caravan, to return in the next episode.\n\nThis episode starts with Palin crossing the border from Niger to Algeria, a desolate border with nothing but sand. A bit north of here are the Hoggar Mountains. At Assekrem he gets up early to view the sunrise from 9000' (3000 m).\n\nNext, he boards an Algerian passenger plane and flies north to Hassi-Messaoud, an oil extraction and refining town; a man-made luxury oasis in the middle of the desert. From here the trip jumps to Libya, normally closed to western TV crews. To gain entry, Michael Palin and his team have joined up with a British veteran's tour, and he mingles with the 80-year-old former \"Desert Rats\" who reminisce about the Battle of Tobruk. He also visits Benghazi and the ruins of Apollonia, once a Greek port, and the ruins of Leptis Magna, once a Roman city.\n\nLeaving Libya, Palin arrives in Tunisia. He joins an octopus fishing crew on a small boat at Djerba, visits a family who live in caves at El Haddej (the scene of his crucifixion in \"Life of Brian\") and tries smoking a shisha (a large water pipe) in a café in Sousse. Then it's back to Algeria, travelling along the northern coast. Here the security is so tight (Palin is always accompanied by armed police) that there's not much chance for spontaneity.\n\nThe last two days are spent in Ceuta visiting an EU-operated detention facility for Africans trying to reach Europe, and talking to a woman on a Spanish beach about the illegal immigrants who die trying to make it across the \"dire straits\" to the \"promised land\". A final shot shows Palin back in Gibraltar, philosophising about the Gibraltar situation (Spain vs. Britain) and the impoverished 3rd world vs. the rich West.\n\n"}

The film was directed by Burt Kennedy and starred Raquel Welch, Robert Culp and Ernest Borgnine. The screenplay was rewritten by Kennedy, who was not credited.\n\nHannie Caulder (Raquel Welch) is a frontier wife, living with her husband at a horse station between towns in the American West. After a disastrous bank raid, the inept Clemens brothers gang arrive at the station. They murder Caulder's husband, gang-rape her, burn down her house and leave her for dead. The brothers go on a crime spree, while Caulder recruits bounty hunter Thomas Price (Robert Culp) to help her get revenge by training her to be a gunfighter. The pair travel to Mexico to have gunsmith Bailey (Christopher Lee) build her a specialized revolver, to be a fast draw specialist. When bandidos surround the house, a gun battle erupts but Hannie is unable to kill a man face to face. Price recommends she give up her quest for revenge but she refuses, telling him to get out and that she was only using him and doesn't need him any more. He leaves, telling her she's a bad liar.\n\nAs he goes, Price sees the Clemens brothers arrive in town. His attempt to take down Frank goes awry, because Emmet throws a knife into Price's belly, mortally wounding him. Hannie goes after them, killing Frank (Jack Elam) in a whorehouse. The two brothers swear revenge on her but she gets Rufus (Strother Martin) in a store when he tries to kill her. Hannie lures Emmett (Ernest Borgnine) to an old prison for a showdown and almost meets the same fate as Price but Emmett's attempt to throw a knife into her back is thwarted by the Preacher, who shoots it from his hand. Hannie kills Emmett face to face but realizes that Price was right: taking revenge will change her forever.\n\n\nPatrick Curtis, then married to Raquel Welch, met with Tony Tenser of Tigon British Film Productions with a view to obtaining funding for a movie starring Welch. Curtis proposed a horror movie or a Western; Tenser, who had always wanted to make a Western, picked that. Tigon put up 100% of the budget, while Curtwel (Curtis and Welch's production company) put up their services. Neither Curtis nor Welch took a salary, instead taking profit participation. Before \"Hannie Caulder\" was released, Tigon and Curtwel co-produced \"The Sorcerers\" (1967), a horror film starring Boris Karloff. Thus, Curtis and Tenser did team up for both a western and a horror film.\n\nIt was the third film from Curtwel, following \"A Swingin' Summer\" and \"The Beloved\".\n\nRobert Culp was signed to co star in December 1970.\n\nThe movie was filmed in Spain, mostly around Almeria, beginning on January 18, 1971.\n\nBurt Kennedy and the cast were reportedly not paid after the first two weeks of filming, causing tension on set.\n\nStephen Boyd has a brief, uncredited appearance as a gunfighter known simply as \"The Preacher\". Flamenco guitar virtuoso Paco de Lucía makes a cameo appearance as a Mexican musician.\n\nFast-draw artist Rodd Redwing was a technical adviser to the film, working with Robert Culp. Redwing suffered a heart attack on the plane returning from the filming in Spain and died shortly after landing in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Hannie Caulder\" opened in London on November 8, 1971.\n\nOn 8 September 1971, the British Board of Film Classification announced that the film would receive a AA certificate rating. It is currently a 15 certificate first applied on video in November 1988.\n\nThe film was released on VHS. 1n 1995, a LaserDisc was released on a single extended play disc by Paramount Pictures and distributed by Pioneer Video Manufacturing. It was presented in an Anamorphic Widescreen and a Full Screen version with no extra features. A DVD was issued in the united Kingdom in 2006 with no extra features. It was reissued in 2010 on anamorphic widescreen with theatrical trailer and stills gallery as extra features. In 2011 Olive Films released the film for the first time on Blu-ray disc in the United States (region A) with no bonus features. It was again released in the U.S. on November 15, 2016 as a digitally restored Signature Edition Blu-ray with four new bonus features including an audio commentary by Western expert and director Alex Cox, \"Exploitation or Redemption?\" a twelve-minute featurette on the examination of rape-revenge movies with Ben Sher, a twenty-one minute interview with cultural historian Sir Christopher Frayling on the making of \"Hannie Caulder\" and the history of Tigon Studios titled \"Win or Lose\" and a 10-page essay titled \"Sympathy for Lady Vengeance\" by film critic Kim Morgan in digital and booklet form.\n\nThe film performed well at the UK box office and was reasonably successful in the United States.\n\nIn contemporary reviews, the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" described the film as \"a disappointing Western\" that was an \"uneasy course between parody and imitation in an unlikely amalgam of \"The Wild Bunch\" and \"One Million Years B.C.\", with the odd nod to \"Myra Breckinridge\".\" The review noted the lack of dialogue from Welch and that the Clemens brothers in the film are allowed some \"rather tedious verbal horseplay\". However, recent retrospectives and reviews, as in \"Filmmaker Magazine\", saw the film as a fascinating bridge between the classical period, represented by John Ford and John Wayne, and the postmodern age of Peckinpah, Corbucci, and Leone. A bouillabaisse of elements that should not work together but do —lyricism, graphic violence, moral contemplation, broad humour, feminist inquiry — it is a masterful hybrid of tried and true Hollywood conventions and the more confrontational style of the Italian Westerns that supplanted American oaters in the mainstream consciousness.\n\nQuentin Tarantino said the film was one of his inspirations for \"Kill Bill\". \"Why I love \"Hannie Caulder\" so much is Robert Culp. He is so magnificent in that movie. I actually think there's a bit of similarity between Pai Mei and the Bride (in \"Kill Bill: Volume 2\").\"\n\nThe character \"Price\" from the film was the inspiration for the character \"Captain Price\" from the game series Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 1,2,3. In the beginning of \"Modern Warfare 1\" Captain Price teaches the gamers (similar to Price teaching Hannie Caulder) how to shoot. At the end in Modern Warfare 3 the game ends with the character \"Yuri\" getting a knife through his body like \"Price\" did at the end of the film. The characters Price and Captain Price have very similar looks as well and the same goes MacTavish who looks like Bailey. Also notable are the three villains in the movie and three villains in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1,2,3 that have quite similar looks.\n\n"}
