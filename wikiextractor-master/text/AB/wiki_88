The station is owned by Tegna Inc., as part of a duopoly with Slidell-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate WUPL (channel 54). The two stations share studios on Rampart Street in the historic French Quarter district and transmitter facilities on Cooper Road in Terrytown, Louisiana.\n\nOn cable, the station is available on Cox Communications channel 3 in both standard and high definition (Cox's local origination channel YurView Louisiana is carried on channel 4). WWL-TV formerly served as the CBS affiliate of record for the Gulf Coast region of Mississippi, until ABC affiliate WLOX (channel 13) in Biloxi launched a CBS-affiliated digital subchannel in 2012.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on September 7, 1957. Coincidentally, it was the fourth television station to sign on in the New Orleans media market, behind WDSU-TV (channel 6)—which signed on in December 1948, WJMR-TV (channel 61, now WVUE-DT on channel 8)—which signed on in November 1953, and WYES-TV (channel 8, now on channel 12)—which signed on in April 1957, five months before WWL-TV's launch. It was originally owned by Loyola University of the South (now Loyola University New Orleans; it was one of a very few handful of commercial TV stations owned by a university), which also owned radio station WWL 870 AM. WWL-TV has been an affiliate of the CBS television network since its inception, as WWL radio had been (and still is) an affiliate of the CBS Radio Network (now CBS News Radio) since 1935. Channel 4 competed head-to-head with NBC affiliate WDSU for first place during the 1960s and 1970s. However, after Edgar B. Stern, Jr. sold WDSU to South Carolina-based Cosmos Broadcasting in 1972, it began deemphasizing local features in favor of its highly regarded newscasts. By comparison, WWL-TV, as the only locally owned station, heavily stressed its local roots. By the early 1980s, WWL-TV had emerged as the market's ratings leader.\n\nIn 1988, WWL-TV and Cox Cable, the major cable provider serving areas of Greater New Orleans located south of Lake Pontchartrain, entered into a joint venture to form a cable-only news channel called NewsWatch 15 (named after the cable slot on Cox where the channel is carried). It debuted on October 20, 1989. NewsWatch 15 was one of the first regional cable news channels in the United States at the time. The channel airs rebroadcasts and live simulcasts of local newscasts seen on WWL-TV, along with breaking news coverage that does not necessarily warrant extended coverage on channel 4.\n\nIn 1989, Loyola sold its media properties to different owners. WWL radio and its FM sister station, WLMG (101.5) were purchased by Keymarket Communications, while WWL-TV's employees formed a group called Rampart Broadcasting (named after the road, Rampart Street, where the station's studio facility is located). Led by general manager J. Michael Early and longtime news director and station editorialist Phil Johnson, the employees group bought the station. It was the first (and thus far, only) time that an employee-investor group acquired a U.S. television station. (CHEK-TV in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada was similarly acquired by an employee-led group in 2009, which narrowly avoided the station's shutdown.)\nIn 1990, WWL-TV began running one of the most successful station image campaigns in the United States with the debut of its \"Spirit of Louisiana\" promotions. The one-minute spots focus on the region's musical and cultural heritage, and also showcase life in southeastern Louisiana. Many of the ads in the campaign, which continues to this day, feature well-known area musicians and singers.\n\nThe station's local ownership came to an end in 1994, when the station was bought by the Dallas-based Belo Corporation. That year, channel 4's status as the unofficial \"home\" station of the New Orleans Saints came to an end after CBS lost the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference television package to Fox in December 1993. WWL-TV had aired most of the Saints' games since the team's inception in 1966, when CBS was the broadcast rightsholder for the pre-merger NFL, and continued upon the merger of the American Football League and the National Football League in 1970 with CBS becoming the NFC rightsholder. After CBS lost the NFC broadcast rights, the Saints telecasts moved to then-Fox affiliate WNOL-TV (channel 38) for the 1994 and 1995 seasons, before moving again to WVUE-TV (channel 8) upon that station's switch from ABC to Fox in January 1996. Today, WWL-TV only carries select games televised by CBS, primarily those in which the Saints play host to an AFC opponent at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome although NFL cross-flexing procedures established in 2014 now allow for road games or NFC home games to be carried by CBS. The station also aired the Saints' victory in Super Bowl XLIV. WWL also provided local coverage of 5 New Orleans hosted Super Bowls, including IV and VI which were played at local Tulane Stadium, as well as Super Bowls XII, XXIV, and XLVII which were played at the Superdome.\n\nIn 2005, Viacom—which owned UPN station WUPL-TV (channel 54, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) at the time through its Paramount Stations Group subsidiary—had made an offer to acquire WWL-TV, which would have created a duopoly with WUPL and turned channel 4 into a CBS owned-and-operated station (Viacom owned CBS from its 1999 merger with the network, which ironically traces the former company's history back to its existence as a syndicator of CBS programming, until December 2005, when shared parent National Amusements decided to split Viacom and CBS into two separate companies). However, after Belo rejected Viacom's purchase offer for WWL, Viacom instead reached a deal to sell WUPL to Belo in July of that year for $14.5 million. The deal was slated to close by the end of 2005, but was placed on hold when Hurricane Katrina devastated the Greater New Orleans area in late August. As a result, on February 9, 2006, CBS filed a breach of contract lawsuit against the Belo Corporation over the failure to finalize the sale of WUPL to Belo. The litigation was later settled on February 26, 2007, with Belo announcing that it would complete its purchase of WUPL. The deal had already received Federal Communications Commission approval, and was finalized on February 26, 2007; Belo moved WUPL's operations into WWL's Rampart Street studio facility in mid-April 2007.\n\nTwo days prior to Hurricane Katrina's landfall, WWL-TV began 24-hour continuous coverage of the storm on August 27, 2005 from its Rampart Street facility. Following a meeting between chief meteorologist Carl Arredondo and then-news director Sandy Breland on enacting a plan to evacuate station staff, at 10:45 p.m. on August 28, the station moved its operations to the Manship School of Mass Communications at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge—which had agreed the year prior to allow WWL to use the journalism school as a backup facility in the event that a major hurricane forced the station to evacuate from New Orleans. 20 employees were evacuated to the LSU campus, 20 more were moved to the transmitter site in Gretna and an additional 28 staffers remained at the Rampart Street facility (those staffers eventually evacuated to the Hyatt Regency Hotel as conditions worsened). LSU students and staff helped produce the telecast with WWL-TV staff in a \"bare bones\" fashion.\n\nThe station briefly returned to its Rampart Street studios in New Orleans on August 29 at 4:00 p.m. Flooding forced the station to again move operations back to the LSU campus in Baton Rouge, as well as a foyer used as a makeshift studio at the Gretna transmitter site, which did not sustain significant damage as the facility—built in 2000—was constructed to withstand winds with the transmitter building positioned above ground on concrete; the transmitter site was evacuated on August 30 due to looting concerns. WWL was the only New Orleans station that was able to provide coverage of the storm and its aftermath uninterrupted, as it relayed its signal via fiber optic relay and used a satellite truck loaned to the station by Houston sister KHOU-TV to provide live field reports and helicopters loaned from KHOU and Dallas sister station WFAA. Due to overcrowding with WWL and other Belo station staffers at the Manship School building, on September 1, the station moved operations again, this time to the studios of Louisiana Public Broadcasting station WLPB-TV in Baton Rouge. This provided WWL with a much larger facility and expanded its audience to include LPB's statewide network; the station's coverage was also carried by many PBS stations in Louisiana and Mississippi as well as by KHOU and WFAA. WWL's operations returned to New Orleans about six weeks later.\n\nWWL-TV's extensive coverage of Hurricane Katrina earned the station its sixth Peabody Award in early April 2006, as well as a duPont–Columbia Award in 2007; it was also recounted in an episode of The Weather Channel documentary series \"Storm Stories\".\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, some of the station's most visible talent—including weekend anchor/reporter Josh McElveen and reporter Stephanie Riegel—left channel 4 to pursue other opportunities. 10:00 p.m. anchor Karen Swensen also left WWL to work at Boston-based regional news channel New England Cable News; meteorologists David Bernard and John Gumm also left the station (Bernard was already scheduled to leave the station before the storm struck).\n\nFollowing the storm, WWL-TV brought back a station editorial segment. Modeled after the editorials presented for many years until the 1990s by longtime news director and station manager Phil Johnson, editorials seen in the present day (which air during the station's 6:00 p.m. newscast on Tuesday nights) are read via script by WWL-TV political analyst Clancy Dubos, who discusses current political issues related to the post-Katrina redevelopment of New Orleans.\n\nIn 2004, WWL-TV and Belo announced plans to construct a new multimillion-dollar broadcasting facility for the station and WUPL at 700 Loyola Avenue in downtown New Orleans. The complex—to have been named the J. Michael Early Broadcast Center, after the station's former general manager—was originally scheduled to be completed in late 2007 or early 2008. Groundbreaking of the new facility occurred on July 25, 2005 (just over one month before Katrina hit on August 29); however, its construction has been delayed (as of recently, the site is still a parking lot). As a result, WWL-TV and WUPL will remain at the existing Rampart Street studio location for the foreseeable future. WWL-TV celebrated its 50th anniversary of broadcasting on September 7, 2007; it observed its 55th anniversary half a decade later, in 2012, and its 60th in 2017.\n\nThe same agreement for the use of Louisiana Public Broadcasting's studio facilities and the simulcast on LPB's stations statewide that was enacted following Hurricane Katrina was also utilized for coverage of Hurricane Gustav, when the storm hit southern Louisiana in early September 2008. \n\nWWL-TV's coverage also carried on the second digital subchannels of fellow Belo sister stations WFAA-TV in Dallas and KHOU-TV in Houston for the convenience of evacuees who relocated to Texas to avoid the storm.\n\nOn June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire Belo's television properties, including WWL-TV and WUPL, for $1.5 billion. The sale received FCC approval on December 20, and was formally completed on December 23, 2013.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, Gannett split in two with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WWL-TV and WUPL were both retained by the latter company, named Tegna.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn September 8, 2010, former owner Belo signed an agreement with the Disney–ABC Television Group to carry the Live Well Network on WWL-TV and four other stations (WFAA, KMOV in St. Louis, WVEC in Norfolk, Virginia and WCNC-TV in Charlotte). The network began to be carried on digital subchannel 4.2 on November 8. After ABC announced the discontinuation of the Live Well Network in late 2014, WWL-DT2 (as well as other Tegna O&O stations) switched affiliations to the new Justice Network in 2015. In May 2016, Tegna launched Weigel's Decades network on WWL-DT3.\n\nWWL-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 36. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 4.\n\nAs part of the SAFER Act, WWL-TV kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.\n\nSyndicated programs broadcast by WWL-TV include \"Daily Blast Live\", \"Dr. Phil\" and \"Inside Edition\". The latter two programs are distributed by CBS' corporate cousin, CBS Television Distribution. WWL-TV carries the majority of the CBS network schedule, although the station splits the \"CBS Dream Team\" block over two days (the first two hours of the block air on Saturday mornings, while the final hour airs on Sundays).\n\nWWL-TV preempted moderate amounts of CBS programming from the 1960s to the 1980s—including most notably, programs that the network aired weekdays during the 9:00 a.m. hour, as well as CBS' late night lineup, prior to the debut of \"Late Show with David Letterman\" in 1993. During the 1970s, WWL-TV preempted the last hour of the network's Saturday children's programming, between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m., with local programming. Prior to 2015, WWL-TV would air \"The Late Late Show\" on a half-hour delay at 12:07 a.m., with syndicated programming (including \"The Insider\") filling the program's 11:37 p.m. network timeslot on weeknights. WWL-TV now airs \"The Late Late Show\" in its current 11:37 p.m. slot after \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\".\n\nIn the late 1980s, WWL-TV dropped CBS' weekday morning news program \"CBS This Morning\", instead airing a two-hour morning newscast from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m. It was the first New Orleans station whose morning newscast ran after 7:00 a.m., predating the launch of WVUE's morning newscast by about 15 years. WWL-TV's morning news was followed by \"Live with Regis and Kathie Lee\". The station eventually expanded its weekday morning newscast, \"Eyewitness Morning News\", into the 8:00 a.m. hour. CBS reached agreements with other area stations to carry its morning shows: LeSEA owned-and-operated station WHNO (channel 20) picked up \"This Morning\" in 1998; its successor, \"The Early Show\", moved from WHNO to WUPL in January 2005. Despite preempting the weekday edition, WWL-TV did air the Saturday edition. On December 5, 2016, WWL-TV began carrying \"CBS This Morning\" weekdays for the entire two hours (likely due to a corporate mandate from Tegna in order to satisfy their CBS affiliation agreements), while WUPL now carries the 7–9 a.m. block of \"Eyewitness Morning News\".\n\nWWL-TV presently broadcasts 27 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4½ hours each weekday, 2½ hours on Saturdays and two hours on Sundays). In addition, the station produces the half-hour sports highlight and discussion program \"4th Down on 4\", which airs Sunday nights at 10:35 p.m. The station also operates a Northshore bureau located on North Causeway Boulevard in suburban Mandeville.\n\nThe station implemented the \"Eyewitness News\" format on February 26, 1968, having rebranded its newscasts from the \"Evening News\" title it had been using for the previous two years. WWL-TV has been the top-rated station among the New Orleans market's local newscasts for nearly 30 years, according to Nielsen Media Research. During the November 2007 sweeps period, the first major ratings period in New Orleans reported to Nielsen since Hurricane Katrina, the results affirmed that WWL-TV continued to lead its nearest competitors, WDSU and WVUE, by a wide margin.\nIn March 2006, WWL-TV began producing a half-hour newscast called \"I-News\", featuring more in-depth reporting on topics important to viewers. The program also featured live interviews with local, state and national officials. The newscast aired weekday evenings on the station's website, WWLTV.com, after its 6:00 p.m. newscast and was rebroadcast on channel 4. (The webcast has since been canceled.) \n\nOn June 4, 2007, WWL-TV began producing a half-hour primetime newscast each Monday through Friday evening at 9:00 p.m. for MyNetworkTV-affiliated sister station WUPL. Titled \"My54 Eyewitness News at 9\", it was anchored by Lucy Bustamante and Mike Hoss—who also anchored the station's 10:00 p.m. newscast, \"Eyewitness News Nightwatch\"—until Bustamante departed WWL-TV for sister station WVEC in Norfolk on October 1, 2010. Bustamante was replaced by Karen Swensen—whom Bustamante replaced as evening co-anchor—as anchor of the 9:00 p.m. newscast on WUPL and the 10:00 p.m. newscast on channel 4 on February 24, 2011; in the interim, Hoss anchored the newscast on WUPL with a rotating series of co-anchors. The 9:00 p.m. newscast on WUPL was discontinued on April 26, 2013, as a result of consistently low ratings.\n\nSince the anchor changes, WWL-TV has lost its significant ratings lead over WDSU, WVUE and WGNO, according to Nielsen Media reports, but its newscasts remain the highest-rated among the New Orleans market's news-producing stations. WWL-TV had once doubled the ratings of each of its competitors in every time period, but its lead gradually declined, reaching as close a margin as one household rating point ahead of second place WDSU (in the 6:00 p.m. timeslot) during the July 2011 sweeps period. At 5:00 p.m., WWL-TV led WDSU by only two ratings points, while claiming ratings wins in key demographics at both 5:00 and 6:00 p.m.—marking the first time in about 25 years that a station other than WWL-TV had placed first in the 25-54 demographic. At 10:00 p.m., WWL-TV led WVUE by 1.9 ratings points. Newscasts in less competitive time periods of 4:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. also scored wins in key demographic categories, as well as in household ratings.\n\nIn April 2010, WWL-TV became the second station in the market to install an HD-based weather system. Former WDSU morning anchor Melanie Hebert joined channel 4 in January 2012, however she did not appear on-air until that July due to a non-compete clause in her previous WDSU contract. (Hebert left WWL-TV in July 2013, after a year at the station.) In September 2010, WWL-TV began broadcasting its local newscasts in widescreen standard definition; the WUPL newscast was included in the upgrade. Then WWL-TV switched to full HD on October 1, 2014. Presently, WGNO and WDSU continue to broadcast their local newscasts in widescreen SD rather than in true high definition; the first news-producing station in the market to have upgraded their news production to HD was WVUE, which had broadcast its local news programming in the format since April 2007). On October 25, 2012, WWL-TV introduced a new state-of-the-art news set designed by FX Group that includes the station's first full-size weather center to be integrated with the main set (it replaced a set that debuted in 1997, which had been refreshed a few times during its lifespan).\n\nOn August 9, 2014, WWL-TV debuted hour-long weekend editions of its \"Eyewitness Morning News\" broadcasts on Saturdays at 8:00 a.m. and Sundays at 6:00 a.m. On September 9, the station restored an evening newscast on WUPL's schedule with the debut of a half-hour 6:30 p.m. newscast on weeknights.\n\n\n\n"}

Dennistoun Burney, funded by Sir George White, founder of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. It was used against naval mines and submarines.\n\nInitially developed to destroy naval mines, the paravane is strung out and streamed alongside the towing ship, normally from the bow. The wings of the paravane pull it away laterally from the towing ship, placing a tension on the tow cable. If the tow cable snags the cable anchoring a mine then the anchoring cable is cut by jaws on the paravane, allowing the mine to float to the surface, where it is destroyed by gunfire. If the anchor cable fails to part, the mine and the paravane are brought together and the mine explodes against the paravane. The cable can then be retrieved and a replacement paravane fitted.\n\nBurney developed explosive paravanes as an anti-submarine weapon, a \"high speed sweep\". It was a paravane, containing of TNT towed by an armoured electric cable. The warhead was fired automatically as soon as the submarine touched the paravane or towing cable, or manually from the ship's bridge. It could be quickly deployed into the water and towed up to , and recovery was reasonably simple.\n\n"}

{"id": "2026856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026856", "title": "Les Horvath", "text": "Les Horvath\n\nLeslie Horvath (October 12, 1921 – November 14, 1995) was an American football quarterback and halfback who won the Heisman Trophy while playing for Ohio State University in 1944. Horvath was the first Ohio State player to win the Heisman, an award given to the best college football player in the United States. The school retired his jersey number 22 in 2001.\n\nHorvath grew up in Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland and became a standout high school athlete despite his small stature. He entered Ohio State in 1939 on a work scholarship, but tried out for and made the football team the following year. He played as a reserve halfback on the 1942 team coached by Paul Brown that won Ohio State's first-ever national championship. Horvath graduated that year and moved to Ohio State's dental school. In 1944, however, acting Ohio State football coach Carroll Widdoes asked Horvath to rejoin the team, taking advantage of a World War II-era rule allowing graduate students with remaining eligibility to play. Horvath agreed, and helped lead the Buckeyes to a 9–0 record and a second-place showing in the AP Poll. He won the Heisman and was named an All-American after the season.\n\nHorvath graduated from dental school in 1945 and served as a dental officer in the U.S. Navy for two years. Following his discharge, he played professionally for the Los Angeles Rams in 1947 and 1948 before being released and signing with the Cleveland Browns in 1949. The Browns won the All-America Football Conference championship that year. Horvath retired from playing in 1950 and moved to Los Angeles to practice dentistry, and lived there for the rest of his life. Horvath was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1966 and the Ohio State athletics hall of fame in 1977.\n\nHorvath was born to immigrant parents from Hungary in 1921, in South Bend, Indiana; his family soon moved to Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. He attended Parma Senior High School starting in 1936 and played on the track, basketball and football teams until the 11th grade. He decided to switch schools because he felt his basketball teammates were not taking the sport seriously. Horvath's family relocated, and in 1938 he enrolled at James Ford Rhodes High School in Cleveland, one of Parma's rivals. Playing as a quarterback for the Rhodes Rams, Horvath guided the team to seven straight wins in 1938, but the team lost to West Technical High School for a chance to be the Cleveland Senate League's Western Conference representative in the city championship. He graduated in 1939.\n\nAfter graduating, Horvath attended Ohio State University on a work scholarship, but managed to make the school's football team in 1940. Horvath was small for a football player – he weighed just 160 pounds – but was a quick runner and had a strong arm. Ohio State's football team was a disappointment in 1940, however, finishing the season with a 4–4 win–loss record under head coach Francis Schmidt. Schmidt was fired after the season and replaced by Paul Brown, an Ohio high school coach who had guided Massillon Washington to a series of undefeated records and state championships. Brown simplified Ohio State's offense, but imposed a level of discipline and organization that had been absent under Schmidt. Horvath was a reserve halfback in the Buckeyes' single-wing offense in 1941, when the team posted a 6–1–1 win–loss–tie record and finished second in the Big Ten Conference standings. He played in many games, but senior fullback Jack Graf and senior halfback Tom Kinkade got most of the carries for Ohio State.\n\nDespite his small frame, Brown recognized Horvath's potential as a senior in 1942 and made him a regular starter at halfback beside Paul Sarringhaus and fullback Gene Fekete. While Sarringhaus and Fekete were Ohio State's main offensive weapons, Horvath averaged eight yards per carry in a victory over Pittsburgh and scored two touchdowns and passed for 109 yards in a win over Illinois in Cleveland. Ohio State was ranked first in the country in the AP Poll early in the season, but fell in the rankings after a loss to Wisconsin in October. The team won the rest of its games, however, including a 21–7 victory over arch-rival Michigan at the end of the season. Horvath passed to Sarringhaus for a 35-yard touchdown and caught another 32-yard touchdown pass from Sarringhaus in the Michigan game. Ohio State's 9–1 record put it on top of the Big Ten standings and in the final AP Poll, giving the school its first-ever national championship.\n\nHorvath expected his college football career to be over in 1942. He finished his undergraduate degree that year and enrolled in a graduate program at The Ohio State University College of Dentistry. Ohio State's football program, meanwhile, struggled in 1943 after Brown and many of its best players entered the military during World War II. Carroll Widdoes, an assistant under Brown, was appointed the acting head coach and led the team to a 3–6 record.\n\nThe following year, Widdoes asked Horvath to return to the team, taking advantage of a wartime rule that allowed college programs to use graduate students if they had not exhausted their four years of college eligibility. Widdoes promised Horvath a leading role as the team's left halfback, a level of prominence he had been denied under Brown. Horvath agreed to come back and be a veteran leader for a team that was composed mostly of freshmen because of older players' service in the war. Horvath had a breakout season in 1944, gaining 669 rushing yards and 1,200 all-purpose yards as the Buckeyes turned in a 9–0 record and finished second in the national polls. The highlights of Horvath's season included scoring the winning touchdown in Ohio State's annual matchup against Michigan. Calling all of Ohio State's offensive plays, he was nicknamed the \"playing coach\".\n\nHorvath was named a first-team All-American by sportswriters and the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten after the season. He was voted by his teammates as Ohio State's Most Valuable Player. He also won the Heisman Trophy, an award given each year to the best college football player in the country. Horvath was the first Ohio State player to win the Heisman, and he remains the only Heisman winner not to have played football the previous season. In early 1945, Horvath played in the annual East–West Shrine Game, a college all-star game. While at Ohio State, he was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity.\n\nAfter graduating from Ohio State's dental school in 1945, Horvath signed to play for the Cleveland Rams of the National Football League. Horvath, however, applied for a commission to join the U.S. Navy and was sworn in as a lieutenant j.g. that August. He was sent at first to Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois for training, where he practiced dentistry and acted as an assistant to Brown, who had entered the Navy and was coaching the base's football team. Horvath served in Hawaii and coached a football team there that won a service national championship. He later traveled on assignment as far as China as a naval dental officer.\n\nBefore his discharge from the Navy in 1947, there was speculation that Horvath might join the Cleveland Browns, a new team coached by Brown in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Horvath was still under contract with the Rams, however, and joined the team, which had moved from Cleveland to Los Angeles in 1946. Led by quarterback Bob Waterfield, Los Angeles finished the season with a 6–6 record in 1947. Horvath rushed for 68 yards and had three receptions. Horvath had 118 yards of rushing the next season, when the Rams finished with a 6–5–1 record and took third place in the NFL West division.\n\nHorvath, who worked as a dentist in the offseason in Los Angeles, was released by the Rams in 1949. He signed with the Browns a week later, closing his dental office and moving to Cleveland to reunite with Brown. Horvath, who was used primarily on defense early in the season, had an 84-yard fumble return for a touchdown in a game against the New York Yankees, and ran for two touchdowns in a November game against the Chicago Hornets. Cleveland finished the season with a 9–1–2 record and won a fourth straight AAFC championship. The AAFC disbanded after the season and the Browns were absorbed by the NFL, but Horvath decided to quit football to practice dentistry back in California.\n\nHorvath married Shirley Phillips, an airline hostess after the 1949 season, and moved back to Los Angeles. He coached little league football and practiced dentistry in Glendale, California, a major Los Angeles suburb, for the rest of his life. His wife died in 1973, he remarried two years later to Ruby Aylor, whom he met in Hawaii while on vacation in 1974.

{"id": "2026862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026862", "title": "Ray Knight", "text": "Ray Knight\n\nCharles Ray Knight (born December 28, 1952) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball corner infielder best remembered for his time with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets. Originally drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the tenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, he is likely best remembered to Reds fans as the man who replaced Pete Rose at third base, whereas Mets fans remember Knight as the man who scored the winning run of game six of the 1986 World Series and the MVP of that series. He was most recently a studio analyst and occasional game analyst for the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network's coverage of the Washington Nationals from 2007 to 2018.\n\nKnight made his major league debut with Cincinnati as a September call-up in . He spent all of and with the triple A Indianapolis Indians. In 1976, with only one home run coming into the final month of the season, Knight borrowed a bat from Reds star George Foster and hit nine in the remaining games of the year. He would later borrow Foster's bat again in the major leagues when Foster was injured. During those seasons, the Reds won two World Series titles. He returned to the majors in .\n\nKnight was a .232 hitter with two home runs and 19 runs batted in when he assumed the role of starting third baseman for the \"Big Red Machine\" following Rose's signing with Philadelphia Phillies in . Knight responded with a .318 Batting average, 10 home runs, 79 RBIs and 64 runs scored to finish fifth in National League Most Valuable Player balloting.\n\nOn May 13, , Knight broke out of an 0-for-15 slump by homering twice in the fifth inning of a 15-4 win over the Mets. He was the first Red to ever hit two home runs in one inning. Aaron Boone matched the feat on August 9, 2002. He made his first All-star appearance in 1980, hitting a single off Tommy John in his first at-bat.\n\nIn , Knight batted .259 with six home runs and 34 RBIs. On December 18, 1981, he was traded to the Houston Astros for César Cedeño, to accommodate Johnny Bench's move from behind the plate to third base.\n\nKnight split his time between third and first base with the Astros. He made the All Star team in , and played third base in the game. However, he made more appearances at first than he did at third during the regular season.\n\nAfter batting .304 in , Knight was batting only .237 in , he was traded on August 28, 1984 to the New York Mets for three players to be named later (Gerald Young, Manuel Lee and Mitch Cook).\n\nKnight platooned third base with the newly acquired Howard Johnson for the 1985 and 1986 seasons. In his first full season with the Mets, Knight batted only .218 with six home runs and 36 RBIs. During the off-season, the Mets attempted to trade Knight to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lee Mazzilli, but were denied.\nKnight adopted a new batting stance in 1986 and saw immediate results, crushing six home runs and batting .306 with twelve RBIs in the month of April. Teammate Ron Darling spoke highly of Knight's contributions in a midseason interview: \"Besides our pitching, it has been Ray Knight's emergence that has been the difference. He carried us for a long time.\" On July 22, Knight incited a bench clearing brawl at Riverfront Stadium against his former teammates. Eric Davis pinch-running for Reds player/manager Pete Rose in the tenth inning stole second and third base. Knight took the throw from Mets catcher Gary Carter late, brought his glove to Davis' face and knocked his helmet off. A stare off ensued, followed by a right cross from Knight. The benches emptied and as a result of all the ejections from this fight (along with Darryl Strawberry who had previously been ejected for arguing balls and strikes), back-up catcher Ed Hearn was brought into the game, and Carter moved from behind the plate to third. Roger McDowell replaced Jesse Orosco on the mound, and Orosco went into right field. They traded positions with two outs in the eleventh, and McDowell traded positions with left fielder Mookie Wilson with one out in the 12th. This rotation continued for the remainder of the game, which the Mets won in fourteen innings.\n\nThe Mets won 108 games in 1986 and took the National League East convincingly by 21.5 games over the Phillies. For the season, Knight batted .298 with eleven home runs and 76 RBIs to earn NL Comeback Player of the Year honors. Knight batted only .167 in the 1986 National League Championship Series against his former teammates, the Houston Astros. In the World Series, however, Knight broke out with a .391 batting average and five RBIs.\n\nThe Mets won the 1986 World Series in seven games over the Boston Red Sox. Knight's single in the tenth inning of game six of the Series drove in Gary Carter for the first run of the inning, and also pushed Kevin Mitchell to third, allowing him to score on Bob Stanley's wild pitch. Knight then scored the winning run from second after Mookie Wilson's ground ball went through the legs of Bill Buckner, and Knight's celebration as he rounded third to score was one of the indelible images of the series.\n\nHe hit the tiebreaking home run in game seven, and was rewarded with the World Series MVP award and the Baseball Writers' Association of America's Babe Ruth Award for the best performance in the World Series.\n\nUnable to agree on a contract with general manager Frank Cashen for , Knight earned the distinction of becoming the first player to join a new team the season after winning the World Series MVP award, signing with the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East in 1987, narrowly avoiding one hundred losses (95). For his own part, Knight batted .256 with 65 RBIs and tied his career high with fourteen home runs. Following the season, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher Mark Thurmond. Knight served primarily as the Tigers' first baseman or designated hitter, though he did see some playing time at third and in the outfield. Knight batted only .217 with three home runs, and retired at the end of the season.\n\nUpon retiring from baseball, Knight became an ESPN broadcaster. He accepted his first coaching job with the Reds in . Early in the season, Reds owner Marge Schott announced that Knight would replace Davey Johnson as manager of the Reds in regardless of how the Reds did. Schott and Johnson had never gotten along, and relations between the two had deteriorated to the point that she almost fired Johnson after the season. However, the Reds were doing so well under Johnson (they led the National League Central at the time of the 1994 Major League Baseball strike and won the division in 1995) that she instead opted to name Knight as assistant manager, with the understanding that he would succeed Johnson in 1996.\n\nKnight managed the Reds from 1996 to , and served as acting manager for a single game in . In 1997, he forgot how many outs there had been in a half-inning in which the Reds were at bat and called for a bunt at an inopportune time. He later fined himself $250 for the incident. The team's lack of success would lead to his firing midway through the 1997 season in favor of Jack McKeon.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2018, Knight was a broadcaster with the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) and co-hosted \"Nats Xtra\", MASN's pregame and postgame show for its Washington Nationals broadcasts. Johnny Holliday, Knight's fellow MASN broadcaster and \"Nats Xtra\" co-host, playfully referred to him as the \"Silver Fox.\"\n\nKnight was one of several members of the 1986 championship team not to attend the 20th anniversary celebration at Shea Stadium on August 19, 2006; the others included manager Davey Johnson, (who was managing Team USA in Cuba), Dwight Gooden (who was serving a jail sentence), Roger McDowell (who was the Atlanta Braves pitching coach at the time), Lee Mazzilli (who was the New York Yankees bench coach at the time), and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre. Knight's absence was due to a previous commitment.\n\nKnight was previously married to Nancy Lopez, a now-retired LPGA golfer. They had three daughters together: Ashley Knight, the oldest; Erinn Knight, the middle child; and Torri Knight, the youngest. Knight also briefly caddied for Lopez. They lived in Albany, Georgia, and also had a home in The Villages, Florida. He also has a son, Brooks Knight, from a previous marriage.\n\nKnight is good friends with former Reds' teammate Harry Spilman, who grew up twenty minutes away from Knight in Georgia. While they were both in the Reds' system, the two spent $700 on a pitching machine to work on their hitting.\n\nKnight is a member of the Golden Gloves boxing association.\n\nOn October 23, 2017, Knight was arrested after an altercation at his house in the Alexandria, Virginia, area with an unidentified 33-year-old man. Both were taken to the hospital and Knight was charged with assault and battery. The charges subsequently were dropped.\n"}

The term is most commonly used when referring to the scattering of an electromagnetic wave (usually light or radio frequency) by random fluctuations in a gas of particles (most often electrons).\n\nThe most well known practical application is known as incoherent scatter radar theory, a ground-based technique for studying the Earth's ionosphere first proposed by Professor William E. Gordon in 1958. A radar beam scattering off electrons in the ionospheric plasma creates an incoherent scatter return. The distribution function of the ionospheric electrons is modified by the much slower and more massive positive ions — electron density fluctuations relate to ion temperature, mass distribution, and motion. The incoherent scatter signal allows measurement of electron density, ion temperature and electron temperatures, ion composition and plasma velocity.\n\n\n"}

Due to the financial crisis of 2007–2010 slicing an estimated £250 million from his fortune, Hunter was overtaken as Scotland's richest man in late 2007 by Jim McColl, head of Glasgow engineering firm Clyde Blowers, who has an estimated fortune of £800 million. According to the \"Sunday Times Rich List\" in 2019, Hunter is now worth £607 million.\n\nTom set up his first business after graduating from the University of Strathclyde as he was, in his own words, \"unemployable\". With a £5,000 loan from his grocer father Campbell and matching funds from a bank, he started selling trainers from the back of a van. Hunter built the business into Europe's largest independent retailer. In 1998 in an unsolicited offer, Dave Whelan's JJB Sports offered to buy the larger Sports Division for £290 million; Hunter accepted, earning himself £252 million.\n\nHunter had expanded Sports Division through financing supplied by the Royal Bank of Scotland, but when he proposed the takeover of Olympus Sports, RBS refused to finance the deal. Through his friend Sir David Murray, he met Halifax Bank of Scotland governor Gavin Masterton on a trip to watch Rangers F.C. play Juventus, and subsequently built his business on the HBoS relationship.\n\nSenior lending manager Peter Cummings introduced Hunter to property development, which resulted in his purchase of stakes in builder Crest Nicholson, and retirement homebuilder McCarthy & Stone. In 2001 Cummings introduced Hunter to fellow HBoS client Nick Leslau, which led to the purchase of stakes via Leslau's Prestbury Investment Holdings in the freehold property portfolios of Travelodge hotels, licensed premises; and the theme park portfolio of Merlin Entertainments, including Alton Towers.\n\nIn August 2013 Hunter put up a huge cash loan that enabled his friend David Moulsdale, founder of Optical Express eye surgery clinics, to save his company from closure after the Royal Bank of Scotland threatened to seize control.\n\nIn March 2001, Hunter was a founding partner of West Coast Capital, the private equity arm of the Hunter Family. Through this firm he has become a major shareholder in a number of retailers – including USC, Office, D2, Qube; and 8% of British Home Stores (BHS), with the bulk owned by Sir Philip Green, subsequently disposing of them all. His other investments included Wyevale Garden Centres.\n\nAt its height, West Coast investments covered over 50 companies, and Hunter was touted as a possible bidder for Selfridges – he lost out to Galen Weston. However, in light of the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 he sold his stake in Dobbies Garden Centres to partner Tesco, lost his entire holding in Crest Nicholson; and a majority of his stakes in McCarthy & Stone and Wyevale Garden Centres.\n\nWest Coast Capital now holds a number of major investments in property, e-commerce and data analytics including a large stake in listed Secure Income Reit Plc, majority control of the £1 billion Winchburgh Village development and a substantial stake in Order Dynamics.\nWest Coast Capital directly funds, alongside the Hunter Family, venture philanthropy, The Hunter Foundation.\n\nAdvised to move to Monaco after the sale of Sports Division, Hunter wanted to raise his family in his homeland. With a growing realisation that making money was, as he told Andrew Marr in a 2005 BBC interview, \"\"only half of the equation;\"\" and inspired by his hero Andrew Carnegie, whose book \"The Gospel of Wealth\" central premise he often quotes:\nHunter, with his wife, resultantly established The Hunter Foundation in 1998 with a £10 million cheque as a tax management vehicle. After discussions with Vartan Gregorian, head of the Carnegie Foundation in New York City, Hunter set a cause and a method which has resulted in the foundation donating in excess of £50m to supporting educational and entrepreneurial projects in Scotland and sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa in partnership with former President Bill Clinton through the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative.\n\nIn 2001, Hunter was interviewed for the STV programme \"Rich, Gifted and Scots\" discussing his wealth, influences and philanthropy. Hunter coined the term \"\"venture philanthropy\"\" – using his investment pledges to leverage more cash from others to invest with him and becoming involved in the strategic delivery of the initiatives he backed. This ensured he could make a bigger impact with his money.\n\nHis donations and beneficial projects have included:\n\n\nScotland's former first minister, Jack McConnell, has said of Hunter:\nIn October 2013, Hunter was awarded the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. Described by some as the \"Nobel Prize for philanthropy\", the medal recognises those who use their private wealth for public good and is awarded biannually to global figures leading the way in this field. He dedicated the award to his father, who he describes as his \"hero and inspiration\". He also donated over £1,000,000 to children in need in 2018.\n\nIn August 2014, Hunter unveiled the scotlandseptember18.com website dedicated to providing impartial sources of information related to the Scottish Independence referendum. The site focused on 16 questions central to the referendum debate.\n\nIn 1997, he was awarded Alumnus of the Year by the University of Strathclyde.\n\nIn 2005 he received a knighthood for \"services to Philanthropy and to Entrepreneurship in Scotland\".\n\nIn 2013 he was awarded the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy.\n\nHe is married to Marion, Lady Hunter, and has three adult children.\n\nIn 2001 Hunter is reputed to have spent £1m on his 40th birthday party, at which Stevie Wonder performed. The party was held at his home in Cap Ferrat, on the Côte d'Azur, which he sold to a Russian business for reputedly £55m in late 2007.\n\n"}
{"id": "2026886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026886", "title": "Āstika and nāstika", "text": "Āstika and nāstika\n\nĀstika (Sanskrit आस्तिक IAST: Āstika) derives from the Sanskrit \"asti\", \"there is, there exists\", and means one who believes in the existence of a Self/Soul or Brahman, etc. and nāstika means the one who doesn't believe in existence of a Soul or Self. These have been concepts used to classify Indian philosophies by modern scholars, and some Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina texts. \n\n\"Āstika\" has been defined in one of three ways; \n\nIn contrast, \"Nāstika\" are those who deny all the respective definitions of \"āstika\".\n\nThe various definitions for \"āstika\" and \"nāstika\" philosophies have been disputed since ancient times, and there is no consensus. Buddhism is considered to be \"nāstika\", but the Gautama Buddha is considered an avatar of Vishnu in some Hindu traditions.\n\nThe most studied Āstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as orthodox schools, are six: Nyāyá, Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedānta. The most studied Nāstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as heterodox schools, are four: Buddhism, Jainism, Cārvāka, and Ājīvika. This orthodox-heterodox terminology is a construct of Western languages, and lacks scholarly roots in Sanskrit. Recent scholarly studies state that there have been various heresiological translations of Āstika and Nāstika in 20th century literature on Indian philosophies, but quite many are unsophisticated and flawed.\n\nAstika and Nāstika do not mean \"theism\" and \"atheism\" respectively in ancient or medieval era Sanskrit literature. In current Indian languages like Hindi, \"āstika\" and its derivatives usually mean \"theist\", while \"nāstika\" and its derivatives denote an \"atheist.” However, the terms are used differently in Hindu philosophy. For example, \"Sāṃkhya\" is both an atheist (as it does not explicitly affirm the existence of God in its classical formulation) and \"āstika\" (Vedic) philosophy, though “God” is often used as an epithet for consciousness (purusa) within its doctrine.\n\n\"Āstika\" is a Sanskrit adjective (and noun) that is derived from \"asti\" (\"there is or exists\"), meaning \"knowing that which exists\" or \"pious.\" The word \"Nāstika\" (\"na\" (not) + \"\") is its negative.\n\nOne of the traditional etymologies of the term \"āstika\"–based on Pāṇini's \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\",\n4.4.60 (\"astināstidiṣṭam matiḥ\") says ‘he whose opinion is that Īśvara exists’ (\"asti īśvara iti matir yasya\"). Other definitions include \"opposite of \"nāstika\"\" (\"nāstika bhinna\"); \"he whose idea is that Īśvara exists\" (\"īśvara asti iti vādī\"); \"he who considers the Vedas as authorities\" (\"vedaprāmāṇyavādī\"). According to Sanskrit grammarian Hemachandra, \"āstika\" is a synonym for ‘he who believes’.\n\nAs used in Hindu philosophy, the differentiation between \"āstika\" and \"nāstika\" does not refer to theism or atheism. The terms often, but not always, relate to accepting Vedic literature as an authority, particularly on their teachings on Self (Soul). The Veda and Hinduism do not subscribe to or include the concept of an almighty that is separate from oneself i.e. there is no concept of God in the Christian or Islamic sense. N. N. Bhattacharya writes:\nĀstika is also a name, such as that of a Vedic scholar born to the goddess Mānasā (\"Mind\") and the sage Jaratkaru.\n\nThe terms Āstika and Nāstika have been used to classify various Indian intellectual traditions.\n\nA list of six systems or \"ṣaḍdarśana\"s (also spelled \"Sad Darshan\") consider Vedas as a reliable source of knowledge and an authoritative source. These are the Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta schools of Hinduism, and they are classified as the \"āstika\" schools:\n\n\nThese are often coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: Nyāyá-Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya-Yoga, and Mimāṃsā-Vedanta.\n\nThe main schools of Indian philosophy that reject the Vedas were regarded as heterodox in the tradition:\n\n\nThe use of the term \"nāstika\" to describe Buddhism and Jainism in India is explained by Gavin Flood as follows:\n\nTantric traditions in Hinduism have both \"āstika\" and \"nāstika\" lines; as Banerji writes in \"\"Tantra in Bengal\"\":\n\nManusmriti, in verse 2.11, defines Nāstika as those who do not accept \"Vedic literature in entirety based on two roots of science of reasoning (Śruti and Smriti)\". The 9th century Indian scholar Medhatithi analyzed this definition and stated that Nāstika does not mean someone who says \"Vedic literature are untrue\", but rather one who says \"Vedic literature are immoral\". Medhatithi further noted verse 8.309 of Manusmriti, to provide another aspect of the definition of Nāstika as one who believes, \"there is no other world, there is no purpose in giving charity, there is no purpose in rituals and the teachings in the Vedic literature.\"\n\nManusmriti does not define, or imply a definition for Astika. It is also silent or contradictory on specific rituals such as animal sacrifices, asserting Ahimsa (non-violence, non-injury) is dharma in its verses such as verse 10.63 based on Upanishadic layer of Vedic literature, even though the older layer of Vedic literature mention such sacrifices unlike the later layer of Vedic literature. Indian scholars, such as those from Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya and Vedanta schools, accepted Astika to be those that include \"Śabda\" (शब्द, \"Aptavacana\", testimony of Vedic literature and reliable experts) as a reliable means of epistemology, but they accepted the later ancient layer of the Vedic literature to be superseding the earlier ancient layer.\n\nIn contrast to Manusmiriti, the 6th century CE Jain scholar and doxographer Haribhadra, provided a different perspective in his writings on Astika and Nāstika. Haribhadra did not consider \"reverence for Vedas\" as a marker for an Astika. He and other 1st millennium CE Jaina scholars defined Astika as one who \"affirms there exists another world, transmigration exists, virtue (\"punya\") exists, vice (\"paap\") exists\".\n\nThe 7th century scholars Jayaditya and Vamana, in \"Kasikavrtti\" of Pāṇini tradition, were silent on the role of or authority of Vedic literature in defining Astika and Nāstika. They state, \"Astika is the one who believes there exists another world. The opposite of him is the Nāstika.\"\n\nSimilarly the widely studied 2nd-3rd century CE Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, in Chapter 1 verses 60-61 of Ratnāvalī, wrote Vaiśeṣika and Sāṃkhya schools of Hinduism were Nāstika, along with Jainism, his own school of Buddhism and Pudgalavadins (Vātsīputrīya) school of Buddhism.\n\nAstika, in some texts, is defined as those who believe in the existence of \"Atman\" (Soul, Self, Spirit), while Nastika being those who deny there is any \"soul, self\" in human beings and other living beings. All six schools of Hinduism classified as Astika philosophies hold the premise, \"Atman exists\". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, \"Atman does not exist\". Asanga Tilakaratna translates Astika as \"positivism\" and Nastika as \"negativism\", with Astika illustrated by Brahmanic traditions who accepted \"soul and God exists\", while Nastika as those traditions, such as Buddhism, who denied \"soul and God exists\".\n\nAccording to G. S. Ghurye, the Jain texts define \"na+astika\" as one \"denying what exists\" or any school of philosophy that denies the existence of the soul. The Vedanta sub-traditions of Hinduism are \"astika\" because they accept the existence of soul, while Buddhist traditions denying this are referred to as \"nastika\".\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of \"astika\" concept in Jain texts is by Manibhadra, who states that an \"astika\" is one who \"accepts there exist another world (\"paraloka\"), transmigration of soul, virtue and vice that affect how a soul journeys through time\".\n\nThe 5th–6th century Jainism scholar Haribhadra, states Andrew Nicholson, does not mention anything about accepting or rejecting the Vedas or god as a criterion for being an \"astika\" or \"nastika\". Instead, Haribhadra explains \"nastika\" in the manner of the more ancient Jain scholar Manibhadra, by stating a nastika to be one \"who says there is no other worlds, there is no purpose in charity, there is no purpose in offerings\". An \"astika\", to Haribhadra, is one who believes that there is a purpose and merit in an ethical life such as \"ahimsa\" (non-violence) and ritual actions. This exposition of the word \"astika\" and \"nastika\" by Haribhadra is similar to one by the Sanskrit grammarian and Hindu scholar Pāṇini in section 4.4.60 of the \"Astadhyayi\".\n\nThe 12th century Jaina scholar Hemachandra similarly states, in his text \"Abhidhana Cintamani\", that a \"nastika\" is any philosophy that presumes or argues there is \"no virtue and vice\".\n\nNagarjuna, according to Chandradhar Sharma, equates \"Nastikya\" to \"nihilism\".\n\nThe 4th century Buddhist scholar Asanga, in \"Bodhisattva Bhumi\", calls \"nastika Buddhists\" as \"sarvavai nasika\", describing them as who are complete deniers. To Asanga, \"nastika\" are those who say \"nothing whatsoever exists\", and the worst kind of \"nastika\" are those who deny all designation and reality. Astika are those who accept merit in and practice a religious life. According to Andrew Nicholson, later Buddhists understood Asanga to be targeting Madhyamaka Buddhism as \"nastika\", while considering his own Yogacara Buddhist tradition to be \"astika\". Initial interpretations of the Buddhist texts with the term \"astika\" and \"nastika\", such as those composed by Nagarjuna and Asvaghosa, were interpreted as being directed at the Hindu traditions. But, states John Kelly, most later scholarship considers this as incorrect, and that the \"astika\" and \"nastika\" terms were directed towards the competing Buddhist traditions and the intended audience of the texts were Buddhist monks debating an array of ideas across various Buddhist traditions.\n\nThe charges of being a \"nastika\" were serious threat to the social standing of a Buddhist, and could lead to expulsion from Buddhist monastic community. Thus, states Nicholson, the colonial era Indologist definition of astika and nastika schools of Indian philosophy, was based on a narrow study of literature such as a version of \"Manusmriti\", while in truth these terms are more complex and contextually apply within the diverse schools of Indian philosophies.\n\nThe most common meaning of astika and nastika, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism was the acceptance and adherence to ethical premises, and not textual validity or doctrinal premises, states Nicholson. It is likely that astika was translated as orthodox, and nastika as heterodox, because the early European Indologists carried the baggage of Christian theological traditions and extrapolated their own concepts to Asia, thereby distorting the complexity of Indian traditions and thought.\n\n"}

The disposal unit shreds food waste into pieces small enough—generally less than —to pass through plumbing.\n\nThe garbage disposal unit was invented in 1927 by John W. Hammes, an architect working in Racine, Wisconsin. He applied for a patent in 1933 that was issued in 1935. His InSinkErator company put his disposer on the market in 1940.\n\nHammes' claim is disputed, as General Electric introduced a garbage disposal unit in 1935, known as the Disposall.\n\nIn many cities in the United States in the 1930s and the 1940s, the municipal sewage system had regulations prohibiting placing food waste (garbage) into the system. InSinkErator spent considerable effort, and was highly successful in convincing many localities to rescind these prohibitions.\n\nMany localities in the United States prohibited the use of disposers. For many years, garbage disposers were illegal in New York City because of a perceived threat of damage to the city's sewer system. After a 21-month study with the NYC Department of Environmental Protection, the ban was rescinded in 1997 by local law 1997/071, which amended section 24-518.1, NYC Administrative Code.\n\nIn 2008, the city of Raleigh, North Carolina attempted a ban on the replacement and installation of garbage disposers, which also extended to outlying towns sharing the city's municipal sewage system, but rescinded the ban one month later.\n\nIn the United States, some 50% of homes had disposal units as of 2009, compared with only 6% in the United Kingdom and 3% in Canada.\n\nIn Sweden, some municipalities encourage the installation of disposers so as to increase the production of biogas. Some local authorities in Britain subsidize the purchase of garbage disposal units in order to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.\n\nFood scraps range from 10% to 20% of household waste, and are a problematic component of municipal waste, creating public health, sanitation and environmental problems at each step, beginning with internal storage and followed by truck-based collection. Burned in waste-to-energy facilities, the high water-content of food scraps means that their heating and burning consumes more energy than it generates; buried in landfills, food scraps decompose and generate methane gas, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.\n\nThe premise behind the proper use of a disposer is to effectively regard food scraps as liquid (averaging 70% water, like human waste), and use existing infrastructure (underground sewers and wastewater treatment plants) for its management. Modern wastewater plants are effective at processing organic solids into fertilizer products (known as biosolids), with advanced facilities also capturing methane for energy production.\n\nA high-torque, insulated electric motor, usually rated at for a domestic unit, spins a circular turntable mounted horizontally above it. Induction motors rotate at 1,400–1,800 rpm and have a range of starting torques, depending on the method of starting used. The added weight and size of induction motors may be of concern, depending on the available installation space and construction of the sink bowl. Universal motors, also known as series-wound motors, rotate at higher speeds, have high starting torque, and are usually lighter, but are noisier than induction motors, partially due to the higher speeds and partially because the commutator brushes rub on the slotted commutator. Inside the grinding chamber there is a rotating metal turntable onto which the food waste drops. Two swiveling metal impellers mounted on top of the plate near the edge then fling the food waste against the grind ring repeatedly. Sharp cutting edges in the grind ring break down the waste until it is small enough to pass through openings in the ring, whereupon it is flushed down the drain.\n\nUsually, there is a partial rubber closure, known as a splashguard, on the top of the disposal unit to prevent food waste from flying back up out of the grinding chamber. It may also be used to attenuate noise from the grinding chamber for quieter operation.\n\nThere are two main types of garbage disposers—continuous feed and batch feed. Continuous feed models are used by feeding in waste after being started and are more common. Batch feed units are used by placing waste inside the unit before being started. These types of units are started by placing a specially designed cover over the opening. Some covers manipulate a mechanical switch while others allow magnets in the cover to align with magnets in the unit. Small slits in the cover allow water to flow through. Batch feed models are considered safer, since the top of the disposal is covered during operation, preventing foreign objects from falling in.\n\nWaste disposal units may jam, but can usually be cleared either by forcing the turntable round from above or by turning the motor using a hex-key wrench inserted into the motor shaft from below. Especially hard objects accidentally or deliberately introduced, such as metal cutlery, can damage the waste disposal unit and become damaged themselves, although recent advances, such as swivel impellers, have been made to minimize such damage.\n\nSome higher-end units have an automatic reversing jam clearing feature. By using a slightly more-complicated centrifugal starting switch, the split-phase motor rotates in the opposite direction from the previous run each time it is started. This can clear minor jams, but is claimed to be unnecessary by some manufacturers: Since the early sixties, many disposal units have utilized swivel impellers which make reversing unnecessary.\n\nSome other kinds of garbage disposal units are powered by water pressure, rather than electricity. Instead of the turntable and grind ring described above, this alternative design has a water-powered unit with an oscillating piston with blades attached to chop the waste into fine pieces. Because of this cutting action, they can handle fibrous waste. Water-powered units take longer than electric ones for a given amount of waste and need fairly high water pressure to function properly.\n\nKitchen waste disposal units increase the load of organic carbon that reaches the water treatment plant, which in turn increases the consumption of oxygen. Metcalf and Eddy quantified this impact as 0.04 pound of biochemical oxygen demand per person per day where disposers are used. An Australian study that compared in-sink food processing to composting alternatives via a life cycle assessment found that while the in-sink disposer performed well with respect to climate change, acidification, and energy usage, it did contribute to eutrophication and toxicity potentials.\n\nThis may result in higher costs for energy needed to supply oxygen in secondary operations. However, if the waste water treatment is finely controlled, the organic carbon in the food may help to keep the bacterial decomposition running, as carbon may be deficient in that process. This increased carbon serves as an inexpensive and continuous source of carbon necessary for biologic nutrient removal.\n\nOne result is larger amounts of solid residue from the waste-water treatment process. According to a study at the East Bay Municipal Utility District's wastewater treatment plant funded by the EPA, food waste produces three times the biogas as compared to municipal sewage sludge. The value of the biogas produced from anaerobic digestion of food waste appears to exceed the cost of processing the food waste and disposing of the residual biosolids (based on a LAX Airport proposal to divert 8,000 tons/year of bulk food waste).\n\nIn a study at the Hyperion (Los Angeles) sewage treatment works, disposer use showed minimal to no impact on the total biosolids byproduct from sewage treatment and similarly minimal impact on handling processes as the high volatile solids destruction (VSD) from food waste yield a minimum amount of solids in residue.\n\nEnergy usage is not high; typically 500–1,500 W of power is used, comparable to an electric iron, but only for a very short time, totaling approximately 3–4 kWh of electricity per household per year. Daily water usage varies, but is typically of water per person per day, comparable to an additional toilet flush. One survey of these food processing units found a slight increase in household water use.\n"}

In 1897, he moved to St. Petersburg, where he took art lessons. In 1908, he entered St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, from which, he was expelled in 1910.\n\nIn 1910–1914, he took part in the arts group Soyuz Molodyozhi created by artists Elena Guro and Mikhail Matyushin. In 1912, he wrote the article \"The Canon and the Law\", in which, he formulated the principles of analytical realism, or \"anti-Cubism\". According to Filonov, Cubism represents objects using elements of their surface geometry but \"analytical realists\" should represent objects using elements of their inner soul. He was faithful to these principles for the remainder of his life.\nDuring the years 1913 to 1915, Filonov was close to Vladimir Mayakovsky, Velimir Khlebnikov, and other futurists. He co-illustrated Khlebnikov's \"Selected Poems with Postscript, 1907–1914\" alongside Kazimir Malevich during this time. In the autumn of 1916, he enlisted for service in World War I, and served on the Romanian front. Filonov participated actively in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and served as the Chairman of the Revolutionary War Committee of Dunay region.\n\nIn 1919, he exhibited in the First Free Exhibit of Artists of All Trends at the Hermitage. In 1923, he became a professor of St. Petersburg Academy of Arts and a member of the Institute for Artistic Culture (INKhUK). He organized a large arts school of Masters of Analytical Realism (over seventy artists, including an American sculptor and portrait painter Helen Hooker). Their work influenced suprematism and expressionism.\n\nIn 1929, a large retrospective exhibition of Filonov art was planned at the Russian Museum; however, the Soviet government forbade the exhibition. From 1932 onward, Filonov literally starved but still refused to sell his works to private collectors. He wanted to give all his works to the Russian Museum as a gift so as to start a Museum of Analytical Realism. He died of starvation on December 3, 1941 during the Siege of Leningrad.\n\nUnder the umbrella of Universal Flowering, Filonov put forth a manner of working that proceeded from the particular to the general. He believed that objects and fields should be built up from small details and bits and stated that doing it the other-way-round was nothing short of \"charlatanism\". To this end, he worked, and required his students to work, with very small brushes in painting and the finest of points when drawing.\n\nMost of Filonov's works were saved by his sister Yevdokiya Nikolayevna Glebova. She stored the paintings in the Russian Museum's archives and eventually donated them as a gift. Exhibitions of Filonov's work were forbidden. In 1967, an exhibition of Filonov's works in Novosibirsk was permitted. In 1988, his work was allowed in the Russian Museum. In 1989 and 1990, the first international exhibition of Filonov's work was held in Paris.\n\nDuring the period of half-legal status of Filonov's works it was seemingly easy to steal them; however, there was a legend that Filonov's ghost protected his art and anybody trying to steal his paintings or to smuggle them abroad would soon die, become paralyzed, or have a similar misfortune.\n\n"}

Shelby\n\nJoseph Orville \"Jo\" Shelby (December 12, 1830 – February 13, 1897) was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded cavalry in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War.\n\nJoseph Orville Shelby was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to one of the state's wealthiest and most influential families. He lost his father at age five and was raised by a stepfather, Benjamin Gratz, who was a member of wealthy Lexington elite. Shelby attended Transylvania University and was a rope manufacturer until 1852. He then moved to Waverly, Missouri, where he engaged in steamboating on the Missouri River. He also ran a hemp plantation, a ropeworks, and a sawmill. These business ventures made Shelby one of the wealthiest men in the state of Missouri.\n\nDuring the Bleeding Kansas struggle of the mid-1850s, Shelby organized the pro-slavery \"Blue Lodge\" group in Waverly and led a company of Border Ruffians. Shelby's first direct involvement in Kansas was at Lawrence during the March 30, 1855 election of the Kansas territorial legislature. Many Missourians without residence in the territory voted illegally in the election. This was partially achieved through intimidation of election judges, who were prevented from administering residency oaths. Additionally, Shelby and other Missourians harassed several abolitionists attempting to vote, although they were generally not prevented from doing so.\n\nShelby's leadership in the Missouri–Kansas border war damaged his business ventures and partnership with his stepbrother, Henry Howard Gratz. In December 1855, their new sawmill burned, and evidence suggested the use of an incendiary. The mill was uninsured and losses exceeded $9,000. Gratz returned to Lexington, Kentucky, and Shelby auctioned off the business in February 1860.\n\nFollowing the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson refused Lincoln's call for volunteers and maneuvered to take the state out of the Union. The resulting friction between State and Federal militias vying for control of the St. Louis Arsenal led to the Camp Jackson affair and the creation of the pro-secession Missouri State Guard.\n\nShelby formed the Lafayette County Mounted Rifles for Missouri State Guard service and was elected the company's captain, leading it into battle at Carthage, Wilson's Creek, and Pea Ridge. In 1862, he was promoted to colonel and authorized to recruit a Confederate cavalry regiment, returning to Lafayette County to do so. After successfully bringing the regiment safely back to Arkansas, he was given command of a brigade of newly recruited regiments.\n\nIn the fall of 1863, Shelby led his \"Iron Brigade\" of Missouri volunteers on what was at the time the longest cavalry raid of the war, Shelby's Raid. Between September 22 and November 3, 1863, Shelby's brigade traveled 1,500 miles through Missouri, inflicting over 1,000 casualties on Union forces and capturing or destroying an estimated $2 million worth of federal supplies and property. He was promoted to brigadier general on December 15, 1863, following the successful conclusion of his raid.\n\nIn 1864, Union General Frederick Steele's failure in the Camden Expedition of March 23 – May 2, 1864 was largely due to Shelby's brilliant and determined harassment, in concert with other Confederate forces. Steele's men were forced to retreat to Little Rock by the destruction or capture of their supply trains at the Battle of Marks' Mills. Reassigned to Clarendon, Arkansas, Shelby succeeded in capturing a Union tinclad (lightly armored) gunboat, the . The gunboat was burned to prevent her recapture. Shelby then commanded a division during Sterling Price's 1864 Missouri raid. He distinguished himself at the battles of Little Blue River and Westport, and captured many towns from their Union garrisons, including Potosi, Boonville, Waverly, Stockton, Lexington, and California, Missouri.\n\nAfter Robert E. Lee's army surrendered in Virginia in April 1865, General Edmund Kirby Smith appointed Shelby a major general on May 10. The promotion was never formalized, however, due to the collapse of the Confederate government. Shelby's adjutant at the time was John Newman Edwards, who years later (as editor of the \"Kansas City Times\") was largely responsible for creating the anti-hero legend of Jesse James and his fellow Confederate guerrillas.\n\nIn June 1865, rather than surrender, Shelby and approximately 1,000 of his remaining troops rode south into Mexico. Reportedly, Shelby sank his battle flag in the Rio Grande near present-day Eagle Pass, Texas, on the way to Mexico rather than risk the flag falling into the hands of the Federals. The event is depicted in a painting displayed at the Eagle Pass City Hall.\n\nFor their determination not to surrender, Shelby's men were immortalized as \"the undefeated\". A later verse appended to the post-war Confederate anthem \"The Unreconstructed Rebel\" commemorates the defiance of Shelby and his men:\n\nThe plan was to offer their services to Emperor Maximilian as a \"foreign legion\". Maximilian declined to accept the ex-Confederates into his armed forces, but he did grant them land for the New Virginia Colony, an American settlement in Mexico near Veracruz. The grant was revoked two years later following the collapse of the empire and Maximilan's execution. The memory of Shelby and his men as \"The Undefeated\" is used as a basis for the 1969 John Wayne–Rock Hudson film by the same name.\n\nShelby returned to Missouri in 1867 and resumed farming. In 1883, Shelby was a critical witness for fellow ex-Confederate Frank James at James' trial. Shelby was appointed the U.S. Marshal for the Western District of Missouri in 1893, and retained this position until his death. He appointed an African American to office, which led to \"bitter feeling among some of his neighbors.\" Shelby defended his actions.\n\nShelby died of pneumonia at his farm near Adrian, Missouri in 1897. He is buried in Kansas City.\n\nOn July 22, 1857, Shelby married Elizabeth Nancy Shelby (daughter of his first cousin), in a grand steamboat wedding and honeymoon trip to St. Louis. Known as Betty (or Betsy), she was much younger than he.\n\n\n"}

After serving in the Second Boer War, he moved to Fernie, British Columbia in 1904 and became a life insurance salesman. A supporter of the trade union movement he also served as secretary of the miner's union. In 1912 he was elected to city council for the first time and won his first election as mayor in 1915.\n\nIn the 1916 provincial election, Uphill ran for the provincial legislature as a Conservative and was narrowly defeated. The wave of political radicalisation that followed World War I along with his trade union sympathies affected Uphill and when he ran for the legislature in 1920, he did so as a member of the Federated Labour Party which had been created by the province's federation of labour absorbing previous socialist parties. Uphill was elected as one of three FLP MLAs in the province.\n\nIn the legislature, Uphill was an opponent of prohibition clashing with Premier John Oliver on the question. In 1924 Uphill was re-elected as one of three Canadian Labour Party MLAs. The CLP fractured and, in 1928, Uphill was re-elected as the sole Independent Labour Party MLA and thereafter represented the local \"Fernie and District Labour Party\". The British Columbia Co-operative Commonwealth Federation contested its first election in 1933. Uphill declined to join the CCF, viewing it as too conservative. His views had evolved towards those of the Communist Party of Canada though he never joined that party nor ran under its label.\n\nThe 1952 provincial election resulted in a hung parliament in which no party had a majority. The new British Columbia Social Credit League had won 19 seats, only one more than the CCF, led by Harold Winch. The CCF argued that they ought to be called upon to form a government as, with Uphill as a labour MLA, the left had as many seats as Social Credit and that, with much more parliamentary experience than the Socreds, they were better positioned to form a government. The CCF, however, had run candidates against Uphill in the 1949 and 1952 elections. In 1949, Uphill beat the Liberal-Conservative coalition candidate by only nine votes, the narrowness of the victory due to vote-splitting by the CCF. W.A.C. Bennett had foreseen the CCF's argument and obtained Uphill's agreement that he would instead support Social Credit's bid to form the government. By the time Social Credit was defeated in a motion of no confidence the next year, Uphill had changed his mind and pledged to support a CCF government. However, Harold Winch was unable to convince Lieutenant-Governor Clarence Wallace to give his party a chance to form a government and so the legislature was dissolved and a 1953 early election was called resulting in a Social Credit majority government.\n\nUphill remained the sole small-l labour MLA in the legislature until his retirement in 1960.\nHe would make appearances and make speeches at events such as May Day organized by the Communists and later the Labor-Progressive Party.\n\nUphill remained mayor of Fernie until he lost a close election in 1946 but managed to return to the office in 1950. He retired from the office in 1955 due to health reasons, though he remained in the provincial legislature for an additional term.\n\nWhen he died in 1962, 22 flags flew at half-mast to mourn his passing. A new senior citizen's home was named the Tom Uphill Memorial Home in his honour.\n\n"}

One of the most popular and prolific journalists of his era, he was an active partisan for the Whig and Republican parties.\n\nPoore was born at the home of his maternal grandparents in Newburyport, Massachusetts, to parents Benjamin and Mary Perley (Dodge) Poore whose family estate, Indian Hill Farm, was in nearby West Newbury, Massachusetts. His father's family were long-time residents of the area; his mother had been born in 1799 in Georgetown, a small incorporated community in the newly defined District of Columbia.\n\nWhen Poore was seven, his parents took him to Washington, D.C., for the first time, during the administration of President John Quincy Adams. About this time, he enrolled in Governor Dummer Academy in Byfield, Massachusetts, to prepare for a West Point appointment. When he was eleven years old he was taken by his father to England, where saw Walter Scott, Lafayette, and other notables. Poore was expelled from Dummer Academy for misbehavior and apprenticed himself to a printer in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nPoore's father purchased a newspaper in Athens, Georgia, the \"Southern Whig\", which Poore edited for two years. In 1841, he visited Europe again as attaché of the American legation at Brussels, remaining abroad until 1848. During this period he was the foreign correspondent of the \"Boston Atlas\". After editing the \"Boston Bee\" and \"Sunday Sentinel\", Poore returned to the national capital in 1854 as a Washington correspondent. His colorful letters to \"The Boston Journal\" and other newspapers over the signature of \"Perley\" made his national reputation.\nHe ran for a seat in the U.S. Congress from Massachusetts Sixth District in 1856 and lost. He supported Millard Fillmore in the presidential election that year and lost a wager that Fillmore would win more votes in Massachusetts than his opponent John C. Frémont. To fulfil the terms of that bet, he transported a barrel of apples by wheelbarrow from his hometown of West Newbury to Boston. He completed the 36-mile course over two days and was met by a cheering crowd of 10,000 that included a military escort on horseback and the members of local Fillmore clubs.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he organized a battalion of riflemen at Newbury that formed the nucleus of a company in the 8th Massachusetts volunteers, in which Poore served as major for a short time, retaining the title of Major Poore for the rest of his life.\n\nIn addition to his newspaper writing, Poore served as clerk of the committee of the United States Senate on printing records, where he edited the \"Congressional Directory\" beginning in 1867 and the \"Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\".\n\nPoore was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1874.\n\nIn 1885, Poore organized the Gridiron Club and served as its first president. Designed as social events to bring reporters and politicians together to repair the ill-will sometimes generated by news stories, Gridiron dinners featured satirical songs and skits performed by Washington's leading journalists. The Club's annual white-tie dinners continue to attract presidents and other dignitaries.\n\nWhen he died in Washington, D.C., on May 30, 1887, the \"New York Times wrote:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Membrane-anchored Fas ligand trimer on the surface of an adjacent cell causes trimerization of Fas receptor. This event is also mimicked by binding of an agonistic Fas antibody, though some evidence suggests that the apoptotic signal induced by the antibody is unreliable in the study of Fas signaling. To this end, several clever ways of trimerizing the antibody for in vitro research have been employed.\n\nUpon ensuing \"death domain\" (DD) aggregation, the receptor complex is internalized via the cellular endosomal machinery. This allows the adaptor molecule \"Fas-associated death domain\" (FADD) to bind the death domain of Fas through its own death domain. FADD also contains a \"death effector domain\" (DED) near its amino terminus, which facilitates binding to the DED of FADD-like ICE (FLICE), more commonly referred to as caspase-8. FLICE can then self-activate through proteolytic cleavage into p10 and p18 subunits, of which two form the active heterotetramer enzyme. Active caspase-8 is then released from the DISC into the cytosol, where it cleaves other effector caspases, eventually leading to DNA degradation, membrane blebbing, and other hallmarks of apoptosis.\nSome reports have suggested that the extrinsic Fas pathway is sufficient to induce complete apoptosis in certain cell types through DISC assembly and subsequent caspase-8 activation. These cells are dubbed Type 1 cells and are characterized by the inability of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (namely Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) to protect from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Characterized Type 1 cells include H9, CH1, SKW6.4, and SW480, all of which are lymphocyte lineages except the latter, which is of the colon adenocarcinoma lineage.\n\nEvidence for crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways exists in the Fas signal cascade. In most cell types, caspase-8 catalyzes the cleavage of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bid into its truncated form, tBid. BH-3 only members of the Bcl-2 family engage exclusively anti-apoptotic members of the family (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL), allowing Bak and Bax to translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane, thus permeabilizing it and facilitating release of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, an antagonist of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs).\n\nSoluble FasL is less active than its membrane-bound counterpart and does not induce receptor trimerization and DISC formation.\n\nApoptosis triggered by Fas-Fas ligand binding plays a fundamental role in the regulation of the immune system. Its functions include:\n\nDefective Fas-mediated apoptosis may lead to oncogenesis as well as drug resistance in existing tumors. Germline mutation of Fas is associated with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), a childhood disorder of apoptosis.\n\nIncreases in Fas-mediated signaling have been implicated in the pathology of low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and glioblastoma.\n\nMore recently, FasL-mediated apoptosis of T cells has also been suggested as an immune-evasive mechanism by which tumors can suppress T cell infiltration similar to inhibitory immune checkpoints such as PD-1 and CTLA-4.\n\nTherapeutic rationales for the suppression of Fas signaling in the context of glioblastoma and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have led to the development of the Fas fusion protein asunercept (APG101) that is currently in clinical development for these indications.\n\nFas ligand has been shown to interact with:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2026944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026944", "title": "Simon Bamberger", "text": "Simon Bamberger\n\nSimon Bamberger (February 27, 1845October 6, 1926) was the fourth Governor of Utah (1917–1921) after it achieved statehood from territorial status in 1896. Bamberger retains the distinction of being the first non-Mormon, the first Democrat, as well as the first, and to date only, Jewish Governor of Utah. He was also the third Jew ever elected governor of any state, after Washington Bartlett of California and Moses Alexander of Idaho.\n\nBorn on February 27, 1845 in Darmstadt-Eberstadt, Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany, Bamberger was the son of Emanuel Bamberger and the former Helen Fleisch. He emigrated to the United States at the age of fourteen, shortly before the American Civil War broke out. Landing in New York City, he embarked on a train to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was a logical destination, because Cincinnati was one of the leading centers of German life in the United States at the time. However, Bamberger missed the connection at Columbus and ended up in Indianapolis, Indiana and, then Terre Haute, Indiana. He remained there until the Civil War ended in 1865, at which point he relocated to St. Louis, Missouri—perhaps not coincidentally, also a major focal point of German immigrants—and established a garment manufacturing company with his brother Herman. A few years later, while in Wyoming to collect a debt, Bamberger got word that the business had failed. Figuring he had nothing to lose, he struck out for Utah, which at that time was still a territory and barely settled.\n\nBamberger married Ida Maas in 1881. They had four children.\n\nBamberger began operating a small hotel in Ogden, Utah, not far from Salt Lake City. A short time later, an outbreak of smallpox resulted in a quarantine that forced the Union Pacific Railroad to bypass the town, so Bamberger moved on to Salt Lake itself, where he operated the Delmonico Hotel with a partner. In 1872, Bamberger invested in a silver mine, the Centennial Eureka Mine in Juab County. A major vein of silver was struck two years later, making Bamberger a millionaire; for a brief time, he contemplated retiring, but soon got involved in building railroads. He opened various lines linking Salt Lake City to mining operations, but the ventures lost a substantial amount of money, and during this period also built Lagoon, a large amusement park in Farmington, Utah. Another notable venture Bamberger pursued was the establishment of a Jewish agricultural colony in Clarion, Utah. These were the years of the nascent Zionist movement spearheaded by Theodor Herzl, also a German Jew. Herzl believed that Jews, hitherto stigmatized as a rootless, wandering people, urgently needed to get in touch with the soil and develop the agricultural skills that centuries of restrictions in Europe had kept from them. It is quite possible that these ideas influenced Bamberger; unfortunately, however, despite Bamberger's fundraising efforts between 1913 and 1915, the community folded.\n\nBamberger constructed a railroad, the Salt Lake and Ogden, from Salt Lake City to Ogden in 1908. In 1910 it was converted to electric operation. Eventually the family name was adopted as the Corporate name, and it became the Bamberger Railroad. An amusement park and lake were constructed midway between the namesake towns to attract riders and increase business, particularly during the summer months. The Bamberger had good freight business even though it directly competed with the Union Pacific Railroad. Due to the impact of the Depression coupled with the growing use of automobiles riding on new state highways, most U.S. interurbans abandoned operations prior to the start of World War II. The Bamberger, however, survived to the mid-1950s due to a good freight business. It had purchased five modern high speed Brill Company Bullet cars in 1938 to improve schedules and hold its passenger business. During WW2, it constructed new trackage to an army base where it had extensive business. The Bamberger stopped operations in 1955.\n\nDuring all this time, Bamberger had also been getting increasingly involved with politics. He began on the local level, serving on the Salt Lake City Board of Education between 1898 and 1903. A firm believer in universal, free and public education, Bamberger at one point donated some of his own money in order to keep the public school system solvent. In 1902, he ran for the Utah State Senate as a progressively-oriented Democrat, and won re-election repeatedly. During his time in the legislature, he obtained a reputation as a witty man with a marked capability for achieving substantive results.\n\nIn 1912, however, Bamberger was defeated for re-election to the state senate. Four years later, he briefly contemplated running for the United States Senate, since popular election of senators had recently been introduced by means of the 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913. Instead, he opted to run for Governor.\n\nBeing Jewish, as it turned out, was not a fatal handicap for Bamberger, but at first wasn't exactly an asset, either. An anti-Semitic flyer bearing a caricature depicting Bamberger with an exaggerated large nose circulated widely, although eventually a majority of leading citizens publicly condemned it. Then the tide turned in Bamberger's favor, thanks in no small degree to his wit and humor. When making a campaign stop at a community of Norwegian immigrants who had converted to Mormonism, Bamberger initially encountered some resistance from the town's leader, who declared that the community wouldn't deign to consider any \"damned Gentile.\" (At the time, some Mormons referred to all non-Mormons as \"Gentiles,\" regardless of their religion. See Mormonism and Judaism for more details.) Without missing a beat, Bamberger answered, \"As a Jew, I've been called many a bad name, but this is the first time in my life that I've been called a 'damned Gentile'!\" The Norwegian Mormons then embraced Bamberger, declaring him to be an \"Israelite.\" This way of perceiving Bamberger began to spread statewide, putting anti-Semitism out of the equation altogether.\nDuring the election campaign, Brigham H. Roberts, a member of The Council of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), threw his support to Bamberger and called for an end to selecting candidates on the basis of church affiliation. In the primary election, Bamberger defeated Alfred W. McCune, a mine owner. In the general election, the Republican opponent, Nephi L. Morris, made Prohibition the focal point of his campaign; but Bamberger, himself a teetotaler, won easily after pledging unequivocally that he would sign a Prohibition bill.\n\nBamberger's governorship, despite lasting only a single term, was marked by a record of legislative achievement impressive by any standards. Having inherited a large budget deficit, he immediately called for an audit of all state agencies and recovered a million dollars in misallocated funds, a considerable sum at the time. Fortunate enough to have the cooperation of a Democratic majority in the legislature, Bamberger embarked on an ambitious reform agenda closely mirroring that of the Progressive Party led by former President Theodore Roosevelt. The touchstones of Progressivism included regulation of industry in the public interest, women's suffrage, restrictions on child labor and the length of the workday, public education—as well as Prohibition, which in those days was inextricably linked with the women's movement.\n\nAccordingly, under Bamberger's leadership, the legislature passed a wide variety of legislation: a Corrupt Practices Act, to control cronyism and kickbacks from utility companies to public officials, and a Labor Organization Act, acknowledging labor's right to unionize (the Federal Government did not enact such legislation until it passed the Wagner Act of 1935). Bamberger's administration was at the vanguard of modern legislation in other ways as well: in addition to fulfilling his pledge to sign a statewide Prohibition bill before the 18th Amendment was ratified nationwide, he brought Utah to the forefront of securities regulation. He pushed through legislation that prefigured some of the most significant, far-reaching 20th-century reforms in the United States. By establishing a commission to register and regulate securities in Utah, Bamberger's administration was nearly fifteen years ahead of the United States Government, which enacted such laws—the Glass–Steagall Act of 1932, the Banking Act of 1933, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934—only when the exigency of the Great Depression forced it to do so. Bamberger, on the other hand, saw the need for such regulation as a general principle. He also signed laws establishing Workers' Compensation and a state industrial commission to administer it, compulsory high school attendance, and a mine tax that actually contravened his own financial interest. He urged bond passages to improve the state's road network, and convened a special session of the Legislature to ratify the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which passed in 1920 guaranteeing national women's suffrage, a right which Utah women had been granted by unanimous vote of the territorial legislature in 1869 and in the Utah State Constitution in 1895.\n\nOther reforms instituted by Bamberger included the creation of a public health department and a public utilities commission to regulate the price of gas and electricity; a modified line-item veto to assist the governor in curbing pork barrel politics; popular election of judges on a nonpartisan basis; a longer school year; and a water rights commission to supervise water usage in residential development of hitherto rural areas, an especially crucial issue in any Western state.\n\nAll of this was accomplished in a single four-year term, for Bamberger, already 75, declined to run for reelection. He left office in 1921 and returned to managing his business interests. He died on October 6, 1926 and was buried at B'nai Israel Cemetery, Salt Lake City.\n\n\n\n"}

As with Farina's house mixes, the \"Mushroom Jazz\" series incorporates transitional effects (such as a high pass filter) and a generally dry reverb tone.\n\nOriginally launched as a cassette series, the Mushroom Jazz tapes grew from the first Chicago run of 50 copies each on to the next stage, where 500 copies of several volumes were easily distributed and sought after.\n\nAs the acid jazz boom began, he perfected his sound and fused the newest tracks from the West Coast's jazzy, organic producers with the more urban sounds he had championed in Chicago. While the predominant musical force in San Francisco was still dark, dubby House and Wicked-style Breaks, the city embraced the downtempo movement with a healthy bunch of live bands and DJs generating the tunes.\n\nMark Farina, along with Patty Ryan-Smith, created the now legendary weekly Mushroom Jazz club night in San Francisco in 1992. Every Monday night the crowd slowly germinated from 100 for the first few months to 600-700 two years later. As time passed, Farina and Patty put their energies into another project, the first Mushroom Jazz interactive CD-ROM for Om Records. After a three-year run, where the club had established a fanatical, cult-like following for Farina and the Mushroom Jazz sound, the club closed its doors and transformed into a CD series and accompanying tours.\n\nThe eight commercial albums contain an array of artists including Chali 2na, Miguel Migs, People Under The Stairs, Colossus, and Pete Rock, as well as several original tracks by Farina.\n\n\"Mushroom Jazz 8\", the latest volume in the series, was released July 22, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The second administrator is called the administrator \"de bonis non\" and distributes the remaining assets. In the Uniform Probate Code, these titles have been replaced by successor personal representative.\n\nThe most common cause of a grant of \"de bonis non\" by a court is where the administrator dies. However, it can also be granted in cases where the chain of representation is broken. Such would happen, for example, when the executor of a will has obtained probate, but then dies intestate. (Normally, if the executor dies testate, the representation passes to the executor of the first executor's estate upon probate of the latter's own will.

{"id": "2026969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026969", "title": "Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site", "text": "Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site\n\nGwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, National Marine Conservation Area, and Haida Heritage Site, usually referred to simply as Gwaii Haanas (), is located in southernmost Haida Gwaii (formerly known as Queen Charlotte Islands), off the mainland of British Columbia, Canada. Gwaii Haanas protects an archipelago of 138 islands, the largest being Moresby Island and the southernmost being Kunghit Island. \"Gwaii Haanas\" means \"Islands of Beauty\" in , the language of the Haida people.\n\nThe Haida Heritage Site is within the territory of the Haida people, who have lived in Haida Gwaii for at least 14,000 years. (the Haida canon of oral histories) show Haida lived in Gwaii Haanas when the first trees arrived at (Bolkus Islands) as glaciers retreated. Pollen samples indicate trees first arrived 14,500 years ago.\n\nNumerous films have covered Gwaii Haanas, including the 2011 short \"National Parks Project\", directed by Scott Smith and scored by Sarah Harmer, Jim Guthrie and Bry Webb.\n\nFrom the 1970s through the early 1980s, plans to expand logging to Burnaby Island led to controversy, and the first concerted efforts to protect Gwaii Haanas. The \"South Moresby Wilderness Proposal\" was drawn up in an effort to stem natural resource exploitation.\n\nTo prevent logging, the Haida Nation designated the \"Haida Heritage Site\" in 1985, encompassing roughly the southern third of the archipelago. Importantly, the Heritage site included a swath of land and sea, both terrestrial and marine areas. However, logging continued, amidst legal and political battles. In 1987, logging ended when the governments of Canada and British Columbia signed the \"South Moresby Memorandum of Understanding\".\n\nThis accord led to the \"South Moresby Agreement\" a year later, which created \"South Moresby National Park Reserve\". It was not a full national park; it was an area reserved to become a national park, because there were outstanding claims to land ownership among federal and tribal governments. But the measure safeguarded the area, and permitted shared stewardship. It would be managed as if it were a national park, pending land claims.\n\nIn 1993 the Government of Canada and the Council of the Haida Nation signed the \"Gwaii Haanas Agreement\", which changed the name of the national park reserve to a native name. This Agreement expresses respect for both Canadian and Haida designations and interests, and includes a mutual commitment to the protection of Gwaii Haanas. Because the park reserve and the Haida Heritage Site nearly coincide (on land), its official name reflected both designations: Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site.\n\nBased on the Agreement, Gwaii Haanas is cooperatively managed by the Archipelago Management Board (AMB), which is made up of an equal number of representatives from the Council of Haida Nation and the Government of Canada. The AMB is responsible for all aspects of planning, operation, and management of Gwaii Haanas.\n\nFor the Haida, the marine and terrestrial environments are inseparable. The boundary between earth and ocean exists only on a map. Such is not the case with the park reserve. While the heritage site includes both land and sea, the national park reserve overlaps with only the terrestrial portion of the site. The Gwaii Haanas Agreement provided for native–federal negotiations on managing the marine portion of the site, which eventually bore fruit in 2010 when an enveloping protected area was created. Like the national park reserve it surrounds, the marine reserve is reserved for future designation to full park system status, pending sea claim settlements.\n\nMeantime, the Gwaii Haanas NMCAR will balance protecting marine ecosystems, while also allowing ecolgocially sustainable use. This includes traditional harvesting, recreational and commercial fishing.\n\nThe appearance of \"Haida Heritage Site\" in both the names of the national park reserve and the marine reserve is a duplication of name, but not of reference. As part of the national park reserve name, it refers to the terrestrial portion of the site. As part of the marine reserve name, it refers to the marine portion of the site. Still, there are areas of the heritage site—both land and sea—which are outside both federal reserves. These are all in the northernmost parts of the site.\n\nGwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve, which covers 3,400 square kilometres, is \"a primary feeding habitat\" of the humpback whale (North Pacific population) protected by Canada's Species at Risk Act (SARA).\n\nWith the NMCAR established, nearly 5,000 square kilometres of Gwaii Haanas are protected. This is one of the only places in the world where a representative area is protected from mountain top to ocean depth.\n\nThe AMB's crest crafted by local Haida artist \"Giitsxaa\" represents the unique joint management relationship. \nThe AMB chose the sea otter and the sea urchin because of the creatures' significance in the history and tradition of the protected area and because of their ecological significance.\nPopulations of sea urchin, a kelp-grazing species, were once kept in check by sea otters, ensuring an abundance of kelp and species that depend upon kelp communities. With the extirpation of sea otters during the Maritime Fur Trade, the natural balance between species in the community was disturbed. As a result, the sea urchin population has increased dramatically over time and the health of kelp forests is threatened. The loss of the sea otter is a powerful reminder of the vulnerability of individual species and entire ecosystems.\n\nNinstints () or on Anthony Island, located in the southernmost part of Gwaii Haanas, just west of Kunghit Island, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site and a National Historic site of Canada in 1981. The remains of a Haida village on the eastern side of the island —  — represent an outstanding example of a traditional Northwest Coast First Nations village site, complete with standing totem poles and the remains of cedar longhouses.\n\nHaida people have a continuing presence at and four other village sites between May to September as part of the Haida Gwaii Watchmen Program. Between two and four Watchmen live at each site serving as guardians to protect the natural and cultural heritage of these sites.\n\nOther historical villages within the boundaries of Gwaii Haanas included Cumshewa, Clew (Tanu) and Djí-gua.\n\nIn 2004, Parks Canada, on behalf of the Government of Canada, added the entirety of Gwaii Haanas to its tentative list of potential future World Heritage sites, pending approval by UNESCO.\n\nThe landscapes of Gwaii Haanas vary from deep fjords to rugged mountains, salmon spawning streams to sub-alpine tundra. Close to 90% of Gwaii Haanas is forested, 9% is alpine and sub-alpine tundra. The remaining 1% is made up of lakes and wetlands.\n\nAs water drains from the highest mountains - including the rugged San Christoval Range with peaks over - it helps fill over 40 freshwater lakes. In turn, this water drains through more than 100 salmon spawning streams.\n\nThe reserve includes the Hotspring Island, with a hot spring.\n\nA small off the grid community located in Rose Harbour, Kunghit Island is thriving on the only private piece of land in the Southern Gwaii Haanas area. The community's economy is mostly based on small scale ecotourism where it is possible to find accommodation, meals, guides and sea kayaking. Rose Harbour property was until the 1940s an important whaling station off the North Coast of British Columbia.\n\nThe west coast of Gwaii Haanas can receive over of rain annually. Extreme exposure to wind and rain makes the forests on the west coast boggy and stunted, and are dominated by western red cedar and hemlock . Forests of the leeward, or eastern side of Gwaii Haanas, are classic coastal temperate rainforests, dominant overstorey species include large western hemlock, Sitka spruce and western red cedar trees.\n\nDistinct island flora and fauna have evolved over thousands of years. Species here often differ from those found on the mainland. Many common continental species are not found on the islands, or have evolved into unique subspecies such as the black bear which is larger than its mainland cousin. Other species have been introduced relatively recently, such as the Sitka deer, ermine, raccoon, squirrel and beaver. Introduced species now exist in large numbers, much to the detriment of native plants and animals.\n\nAn estimated 750,000 seabirds nest along the shoreline of Gwaii Haanas from May through August. Many are burrow-nesters, such as the rhinoceros auklet, ancient murrelet and tufted puffin. Bald eagles are a common sight and nest along the coastline. Because the islands are situated along the Pacific flyway, dozens of species of migrating birds stop here in spring and fall.\n\nGwaii Haanas came first in a survey of US and Canadian National Parks in \"National Geographic Traveler magazine\", recognized for its pristine environment and sustainable management practices.\n\nGwaii Haanas is a remote location, accessible by sea kayak, boat or chartered floatplane only.\n\nAn orientation is provided to all visitors before they enter Gwaii Haanas.\n\n\nThe museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n"}

It operates under the command of the Direzione Centrale della Polizia di Prevenzione ().\n\nIn 1974 the Chief of the Polizia di Stato Anti-Terrorism Bureau, Emilio Santillo, announced the necessity to establish a tactical unit with the capability to arrest known terrorists and to support the local counter-terrorism field office. Personnel were selected from Police Sports Group \"Fiamme Oro (\"Gold Flames\"), particularly trained in martial arts. The 35-man team was denominated \"counter-commando unit\" and commanded by Maj. Andrea Sgandurra, an officer with counter-insurgency experiences, and a skilled proponent of hand-to-hand combat skills. After one year of training (offensive driving, sniping, various shooting skills, and a tactical assault course) in 1975 the unit became operational and immediately started mission against the left wing terrorist organization NAP (\"Nuclei Armati Proletari\", Proletarian Armed Service). Later they operated against the right wing group \"New Order\", which resulted in the arrests of well-known terrorists Gentile Schiavone and Pierluigi Concutelli. In 1978, the Italian government decided to modify the structure of the Anti-Terrorist Bureau to improve its capabilities. This change resulted in the formation of SISMI (military intelligence), SISDE (civilian intelligence), and a police counter-terrorism agency (UCIGOS, General Investigations and Special Operations Central Office). This office was the only responsible for Italian counter-terrorism. The UCIGOS's tactical unit became the NOCS (\"Nucleo Operativo Centrale di Sicurezza\", Central Security Operations Service), the old counter-commando unit with far more operatives, training, and responsibilities. During its 22 years of existence, NOCS has performed more than 4,500 missions and 205 arrests. The 25–42 operatives studied terrorist methodology and created innovative tactics procedures. Their motto is \"Sicut Nox Silentes\" (As Silent as Night).\n\nIn 1982 under the tactical command of Capt. Edoardo Perna a 12-man section, without firing a single shot, freed Brigadier General James Dozier, who had been held hostage by Red Brigades terrorists. In the following years NOCS expanded in size and capabilities and under new command, then Maj. Maurizio Genolini, became a full-fledged counter-terrorism unit, with capabilities of operations on aircraft, trains, buses, embassies, and stadium areas and established good relations with several counter-terrorism units in the western world.\n\nRecently, NOCS has undergone another change and become the Anti-Terrorism Special Operations Division. The unit improved capabilities in C3I and a computer and video section was added. NOCS was innovative regarding the incorporation of computers in training formalizing this with the addition of a separate video section. NOCS also expanded its training in VIP protection and driving, augmented by training with the well-established United States Secret Service. This relationship sparked the creation of a unit similar in form and function to USSS counter-terrorism teams as well. VIP protection is not a main mission for NOCS, but they are responsible for this duty when high risk personalities come to Italy.\n\nIn 2017, NOCS revealed that a female operator, known as \"Marta\", become part of the operational unit of the department, one of the first cases in European law enforcement where a woman is recruited in a police-tactical unit.\n\nToday, SOD/NOCS have three tactical assault teams and one protection division. All operatives have HALO training, EOD training, sniper and combat shooting. Several operatives have SCUBA training as well. SOD has a logistics branch with specialized personnel in support of operatives. NOCS has several specialized vehicles, operated by specially trained drivers. The basic training last six months and is followed by an advance training program lasting an additional six months.\n\nProspective recruits must have at least four years of service with the PS and be at least 28 years old when they enlist.\n\n\n"}

Walsh played for the Ottawa Senators, winning three Stanley Cups in 1909, 1910 and 1911 and is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. He retired from ice hockey in 1912 and moved west to Edmonton to work. In 1914, Walsh contracted tuberculosis, succumbing to the disease in March 1915.\n\nWalsh was born in Kingston, Ontario, the son of Michael and Catherine Walsh. Martin had an older sister Loretta and older brother William. Walsh played junior hockey for the local Kingston Frontenacs. At seventeen, Walsh entered Queen's University.\n\nWalsh played hockey for the Queen's senior hockey team from 1902–1906 and the team won the intercollegiate title in 1904 and 1906. The 1906 squad challenged for the Stanley Cup in 1906 against the Ottawa Senators. Walsh scored four goals in the two games of the series which was won by Ottawa. Walsh also played rugby football for Queen's, and was a member of their 1905 intercollegiate championship team.\n\nWalsh turned professional for the 1906–07 season with the Canadian Soo of the International Professional Hockey League (IPHL), playing only seven games due to injury.\n\nWalsh was sought after by several clubs, including the Montreal Shamrocks and Montreal Wanderers, but he decided to sign with Ottawa. He joined the Ottawa Hockey Club in 1907 and played for the club for five seasons, winning Stanley Cups in 1909, 1910 and 1911. He was a high-scoring forward and in 1909, Marty scored 42 goals in 12 games. When the National Hockey Association was formed late in 1909, Renfrew attempted to sign Ottawa's star players including Walsh, but Walsh re-signed with Ottawa. When Walsh re-signed with Ottawa, players Fred Lake and Albert Kerr decided to turn down their Renfrew offers. In 1911, he scored ten goals in a Stanley Cup challenge match against Port Arthur, second only to Frank McGee's 14 in one game. After the 1911 season, Bruce Stuart retired and Walsh was named captain of the team. Walsh played his last professional game with the Senators in 1912, finishing with 11 goals in 12 games for the 1911–12 season.\n\nWalsh was recognized for his talent in 1962 when he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1912, Walsh left for Winnipeg with Dubby Kerr to start a cattle ranch. Their plans changed when Kerr was lured out of retirement to play in the new Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). There were reports that the PCHA had signed Walsh as well, but he remained retired. In 1913, Walsh moved west to the Edmonton area, where he worked as a paymaster for the Grand Trunk Railway. While in Edmonton, he coached the Edmonton Eskimos team for two seasons. He guided the Eskimos to the 1913 Inter-City Hockey League title and an Allan Cup challenge.\n\nIn 1914, Walsh fell ill with tuberculosis.

{"id": "2026987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026987", "title": "Dewey Defeats Truman", "text": "Dewey Defeats Truman\n\n\"Dewey Defeats Truman\" was an incorrect banner headline on the front page of the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" (later \"Chicago Tribune\") on November 3, 1948, the day after incumbent United States President, Harry S. Truman, won an upset victory over Republican challenger and Governor of New York, Thomas E. Dewey, in the 1948 presidential election. It was famously held up by Truman at a public appearance following his successful election, smiling triumphantly at the error.\n\nThe erroneous headline of the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" (which later shortened its name to \"Chicago Tribune\") became ill-famed after a jubilant Truman was photographed holding a copy of the paper during a stop at St. Louis Union Station while returning by train from his home in Independence, Missouri, to Washington, D.C. The \"Tribune\", which had once referred to Democratic candidate Truman as a \"nincompoop\", was a famously Republican-leaning paper. In a retrospective article some 60 years later about the newspaper's most famous and embarrassing headline, the \"Tribune\" wrote that Truman \"had as low an opinion of the \"Tribune\" as it did of him\".\n\nFor about a year prior to the 1948 election, the printers who operated the linotype machines at the \"Chicago Tribune\" and other Chicago papers had been on strike, in protest of the Taft–Hartley Act. Around the same time, the \"Tribune\" had switched to a method by which copy for the paper was composed on typewriters, photographed, and then engraved onto the printing plates. This process required the paper to go to press several hours earlier than usual.\n\nOn election night, this earlier press deadline required the first post-election issue of the \"Tribune\" to go to press before even the East Coast states had reported many results from the polling places. The paper relied on its veteran Washington correspondent and political analyst Arthur Sears Henning, who had predicted the winner in four out of five presidential contests in the past 20 years. Conventional wisdom, supported by polls, was almost unanimous that a Dewey presidency was \"inevitable\", and that he would win the election handily. The first (one-star) edition of the \"Tribune\" therefore went to press with the banner headline \"DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN\".\n\nThe story by \"Tribune\" correspondent Henning also reported Republican control of the House of Representatives and Senate that would work with President-elect Dewey. Henning wrote that \"Dewey and Warren won a sweeping victory in the presidential election yesterday. The early returns showed the Republican ticket leading Truman and Barkley pretty consistently in the western and southern states\" and added that \"indications were that the complete returns would disclose that Dewey won the presidency by an overwhelming majority of the electoral vote\".\n\nAs returns began to indicate a close race later in the evening, Henning continued to stick to his prediction, and thousands of papers continued to roll off the presses with the banner headline predicting a Dewey victory. Even after the paper's lead story was rewritten to emphasize local races and to indicate the narrowness of Dewey's lead in the national race, the same banner headline was left on the front page. Only late in the evening, after press dispatches cast doubt upon the certainty of Dewey's victory, did the \"Tribune\" change the headline to \"DEMOCRATS MAKE SWEEP OF STATE OFFICES\" for the later two-star edition. Some 150,000 copies of the paper had already been printed with the erroneous headline before the gaffe was corrected.\n\nTruman, as it turned out, won the electoral vote by a 303–189–39 majority over Dewey and Dixiecrat candidate Strom Thurmond, though a swing of less than one percent of the popular vote in Ohio, Illinois, and California would have produced a Dewey victory. Instead of a Republican sweep of the White House and retention of both houses of Congress, the Democrats not only won the Presidency but also took control of the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nTwo days later, when Truman was passing through St. Louis on the way to Washington, he stepped to the rear platform of his train car, the \"Ferdinand Magellan\", and was handed a copy of the \"Tribune\" early edition. Happy to exult in the paper's error, he held it up for the photographers gathered at the station, and the famous picture (in several versions) was taken. Henning's obituary in 1966, published in the \"Tribune\", makes no mention of the event. Truman reportedly smiled and said, \"That ain't the way I heard it!\"\n\n\"Tribune\" publishers could laugh about the blunder years later and had planned to give Truman a plaque with a replica of the erroneous banner headline on the 25th anniversary of the 1948 election. However, Truman died on December 26, 1972, before the gift could be bestowed.\n\nThe \"Tribune\" was not the only paper to make the mistake. \"The Journal of Commerce\" had eight articles in its edition of November 3 about what could be expected of President Dewey. The paper's five-column headline read, \"Dewey Victory Seen as Mandate to Open New Era of Government-Business Harmony, Public Confidence\".\n\nIn the 1992 alternate history anthology \"Alternate Presidents\", the story \"The More Things Change...\" by Glen E. Cox tells the story of the 1948 election in reverse, with Thomas E. Dewey as the underdog and eventually defeats the early overwhelming favorite, the incumbent Harry S. Truman, by playing to anti-communist fears. The story contains a reference to the famously inaccurate banner headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman\". Given that it was regarded as a foregone conclusion that Dewey would lose the election, the front page headline of the \"Chicago Tribune\" on November 3, 1948 erroneously reads \"Truman Defeats Dewey\". The front cover of the anthology depicts a grinning Dewey proudly holding up the relevant edition of the \"Chicago Tribune\" in the same manner as Truman did in real life.\n\n\"Lisa's Substitute\", a second season episode of \"The Simpsons\", spoofs the incident.\n\nThe back of the satirical newspaper \"The Onion's\" 1999 book \"Our Dumb Century\", which features fabricated front pages throughout the 20th Century, show the famous photo of Truman, the \"Tribune\" front page altered into a fictitious \"Onion\" paper with the headline \"OTHER GUY DEFEATS WHATS-HIS-FACE.\"\n\n"}

He played for the Whitby Athletics in the Ontario Hockey Association. He then played for St. Andrews College and was a first team all-star in 1915. Watson played for the Toronto Aura Lee before serving in the Canadian military during World War I.\n\nHe served in the Royal Flying Corps as a fighter ace. He flew a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a to victory over an Albatros D.V on 25 January 1918, sharing the win with fellow Canadian Frank H. Taylor. By the time he scored his sixth and final win on 4 July, he had destroyed another enemy plane and sent four more down out of control.\n\nAfter the war, Watson joined the Toronto Dentals in a playoff series against the Hamilton Tigers, which the Tigers won. For the 1919–20 season, he joined the new Toronto Granites, the OHA team from the Toronto Granite Club. Led by Watson, the Granites won the Allan Cup in 1921–22 and 1922–23, with Watson named a first-team all-star in both seasons. They then represented Canada at the 1924 Winter Olympics, winning the ice hockey gold medal. At the Olympics, Watson scored 36 goals in five games as the Canadian team outscored the opposition 132-3 over six games. In one game against Switzerland, Watson scored 13 goals.\n\nHe turned down several lucrative offers to play professionally in the National Hockey League. Charlie Querrie, manager of the Toronto St. Patricks, offered Watson $10,000 to join his team for the 1924–25 season, but Watson declined. His Granites teammate Hooley Smith would have a 17-year NHL career, but Watson wanted to enter the business world and retired as a player in 1924.\n\nIn 1930, he became coach of the Toronto National Sea Fleas senior amateur team. During the 1931 playoff season, Watson refereed several OHA games. In December 1931, during his second season behind the bench for the Sea Fleas, Watson made a brief comeback as a player at the age of 33 after one of his players was unable to make a road trip. As coach, Watson guided the team to the Allan Cup in 1932.\n\nWatson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962 and the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\n"}

Along with the similar Class 44 and 46 locomotives, they became known as \"Peaks\".\n\nThe Class 45s became the main traction on the Midland Main Line from 1962, and their introduction allowed considerable acceleration of the previous steam-powered service. The Class 45s remained the main source of power on the Midland Main Line up to 1982, when they were relegated to secondary services following introduction of HSTs on the route. From 1986 Class 45s virtually disappeared from the line. From the early 1980s until their withdrawal c.1988, the class were regular performers on the North Trans-Pennine line working services from Liverpool Lime Street to York, Scarborough or Newcastle via Manchester Victoria, Huddersfield and Leeds. These trains were usually formed of early Mark 2 carriages, of up to seven in a typical train.\n\n26 Class 45s were officially named by BR after various British Army regiments and the Royal Marines. Additionally, several were unofficially named. \nThe engine of the Class 45 was a marine-type, slow-revving diesel, a Sulzer 12LDA28B with a bore of (hence the 28 in the engine designation) and a stroke of . This gave per cylinder, or for the whole engine. The unit was turbocharged and intercooled and gave at 750 rpm. The engine was of the double bank type with two parallel banks of 6 cylinders, geared together to a single output shaft. Six-cylinder versions of the engine were fitted in the Class 25 locos (amongst others) and eight-cylinder versions in Class 33s. Class 45s were the updated versions of the Class 44 locomotives, the latter having a non-intercooled version of the same engine; i.e. the 12LDA28A. The later Class 47 had a modified version of the same engine, a 12LDA28C.\n\nWhen initially put into service, the locomotives were fitted with multi-unit working and steam-heating boilers for passenger service. In the early 1970s, fifty were fitted with electric train supply in place of their steam-heating boilers and assigned to work services on the Midland Main Line from London St Pancras to Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield. These locomotives were renumbered as Class 45/1.\n\nThe Class 45 is unusual in having a 220 volt electrical system for driving auxiliary machines and battery charging. Most British Railways diesels of the same era had 110 volt auxiliaries.\n\n\n\nThe great majority of Class 45s were withdrawn between 1981 and 1988, and the last was withdrawn from service by 1989.\n\nEleven locomotives survive in preservation. A quick summary of these is as follows (a more detailed study can be found in the table above):\n\nA twelfth example, 45015, was also sold into preservation, but not restored. Withdrawn in March 1986 with a seized traction motor, for which repair was not authorised, 45015 was heavily cannibalised for spares to keep other Class 45s working. It remained at Toton, its home shed, until at least 1999. The locomotive was moved to Shackerstone, on the Battlefield Line Railway, in 2002, still with the intention of restoration to mainline standard, despite requiring a replacement engine to be found. In 2010 the host railway gave notice to the locomotive's owner that the still-unrestored 45015 needed to move to a new site. Having failed to find a buyer, it is likely that 45015 will be sold for scrap, although, as at January 2020, the derelict loco was still at Shackerstone.\n\n\n"}

Johnson & Johnson acquired Visine, along with Pfizer's entire consumer healthcare portfolio, in December 2006. In some countries it is called Vispring.\n\nThe active ingredients in the original Visine formulation are potassium chloride and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride which is a vasoconstrictor, and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels.\n\nVisine is administered topically with 1 to 2 drops applied to the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily .\n\n\nA common urban legend is that a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting victim's drink will cause harmless but debilitating bouts of explosive diarrhea, akin to that of a laxative. This will not produce explosive diarrhea, but oral administration of Visine can induce dangerous side effects related to Visine's ingredient tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride such as:\n\n\nAnyone ingesting Visine should get medical attention or contact a poison control center immediately. Ingesting Visine was shown to be lethal regarding the case of Lana Clayton who killed her husband by administering Visine to his drinks over a period of three days in July 2018.\n\nVisine is formulated in several varieties:\n\nVISINE A.C. - Astringent/Redness Reliever Eye Drops (Tetrahydrozoline HCl 0.05%, Zinc sulfate 0.25%)\n\nVISINE FOR CONTACTS - For Silicone Hydrogel and Hydrophilic lenses\n\nVISINE L.R.

John Beckwith also uses the Visine several times over the course of the film to fake crying. This movie has gained notoriety for encouraging the deadly prank of putting Visine eyedrops in drinking water bottles, threatening severe or fatal injury to drinkers.\n\nThe urban legend about Visine's explosive diarrhea-inducing capacity is also perpetuated in the movie version of \"I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell\". In the movie, the main character Tucker Max (played by Matt Czuchry) is making fun of two women at the bar, in which one of them squirts Visine into his beer bottle. This leads to Tucker and an allegedly married woman he leaves the bar with to both have extreme explosive diarrhea.\n\nIn season 4, episode 3 of \"Orange Is The New Black\", an inmate poisons a fellow inmate using Visine; the poisoned inmate immediately experiences explosive diarrhea.\n\n"}
{"id": "2027011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027011", "title": "The Varsity Match", "text": "The Varsity Match\n\nThe Varsity Match is an annual rugby union fixture played between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England. The event began in 1872 with the first men's match, with interruptions only for the two World Wars. Since 1921, the game has been played at Twickenham Stadium, London. It is normally played in early December.\n\nFollowing the 138th match in 2019, Oxford University RFC have 60 wins, and Cambridge University R.U.F.C. maintain the lead with 64; 14 games have ended in draws. Varsity matches between Oxford and Cambridge are also arranged in various other sports. For example, the first recorded water polo match in history was played between Oxford and Cambridge in 1891.\n\nThe women's rugby Varsity Match was first played in 1988 and has taken place at Twickenham on the same day as the men's game since 2015. Cambridge won the 2019 match, repeating their 8-5 victory of 2018.\n\nThe history of The Varsity Match extends back to early 1872. It was a year after the first ever rugby international (Scotland v England). Both Cambridge and Oxford sent officials to meet and arrange a match between each other. At The Parks, Oxford, they played a 20 a-side version of the game (as opposed to today's 15 a-side games; the teams would be set to 15 a-side in 1875). Oxford won the inaugural meeting. In that first match, Oxford wore dark blue jerseys (the same as today, though at some stages they wore white), however, Cambridge played in pink, changing to their blue and white in 1876.\n\nThe second Varsity Match in 1873 was played at Parker's Piece in Cambridge, but since then it has always been played in London. The Oval in Kennington staged seven matches, three games were played at Richardson's Field in Blackheath and another Blackheath venue, Rectory Field, hosted four games before Queen's Club in Kensington became the regular venue from 1887 to 1920. The 1878 and 1879 matches were postponed due to fog. In 1919, the players were apparently invisible due to fog. In 1921 the match was moved to the Rugby Football Union's famous home ground, Twickenham. The official Varsity Match was not played during wartime although a series of matches were played during the Second World War, resulting in nine wins for Cambridge, two wins for Oxford and one draw. All these games were played either at Oxford or Cambridge. The hundredth match in 1981 was played at Twickenham with a three to four-inch layer of snow covering the pitch; it had snowed overnight and the snow could not be removed in time for the game. In 2013 Oxford's Sam Egerton was sent off for an off-the-ball incident and became the first player to be dismissed in the history of the match. Oxford's 43–6 win in 2014 was the biggest victory in the history of the fixture and gave them a fifth successive victory for the first time ever. Cambridge have recorded five wins in a row on three separate occasions, 1972–76, 1980–84 and 1994–98. Oxford's win in the 2015 match was their sixth successive win in the fixture, a record for either side.\n\nThere was not a referee until the 1881 match, when Mr H. H. Taylor officiated. Prior to this each game had two umpires, one from each university. The record number of appearances is held by former RFU secretary Rowland Hill along with Welshman Gwynne Walters both with seven games. Other notable International referees who have controlled this fixture are Englishmen G. H. Harnett (6) Cyril Gadney (6) and H.L. Ashmore (5), along with Welshmen Albert Freethy (6) and Clive Norling (5). Up until the start of the professional era, one of the unique aspects of the Varsity game was that the referee was not appointed by the RFU but agreed upon and invited by the two captains. This tradition ended after the 1997–98 season, along with that of the previous year's captains returning to act as touch judges (a continuation of the original custom of each university appointing an umpire), when the RFU Referees' committee decided that touch judges could only be qualified officials and that the RFU should appoint the referee. Now there is also a television match official.\n\nIn 2001 the MMC Trophy replaced the Bowring Bowl, established in 1976, as the prize.\n2005 was the last year Marsh & McLennan Companies (MMC) sponsored the match.\nSubsequent sponsors have been Lehman Brothers from 2006 to 2007, Nomura Group from 2008 to 2011 and Pol Roger and Glenfarclas distillery since 2012. The clothing manufacturer Jack Wills sponsored the clothing until 2014\n\nMany of those who have played in the Varsity Match have gone on to win international honours; a number of others played in the Match after earning international honours. These include:\n1987 Rugby World Cup winning All Blacks captain David Kirk played in the 1987 and 1988 Varsity Matches after ending his international career to take up a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford. Brian Smith represented Australia in the 1987 Rugby World Cup and played in the 1988 and captained 1989 Varsity match for Oxford, before continuing his international career with Ireland 1990–1991. Former Wallaby Joe Roff played in the 2006 and 2007 Varsity Matches for Oxford after retiring from professional rugby, captaining the side in 2007. Five former or current internationals played in the 2008 Varsity Match. The most notable were retired All Black hooker Anton Oliver for Oxford and former Wallaby lock Dan Vickerman for Cambridge, with Oxford also fielding current Canada flanker Stan McKeen and Cambridge fielding former All Black centre Mark Ranby and former USA scrum-half Doug Rowe. Vickerman captained Cambridge in the 2009 Match, in which McKeen and Rowe also played. For the 2015 match, Wales and British & Irish Lions centre Jamie Roberts played for Cambridge University as he studied for his master's degree in medical science at the university.\n\nResults and information available on Varsity Match website \n\n\n\n\n"}

Her motives were financial but she never made much money from her adventure.\n\nAnnie Edson Taylor was born on October 24, 1838, in Auburn, New York. She was one of eight children born to Merrick Edson (1804–1850) and Lucretia Waring; her father owned a flour mill and died when she was 12 years old, leaving enough money to provide a comfortable living for the family. She became a schoolteacher (she received an honors degree in a four-year training course). During her studies, she met David Taylor. They were married and had a son who died in infancy. Her husband died soon after. After she was widowed, she spent her working years in between jobs and locales.\nEventually, she ended up in Bay City, Michigan, where she hoped to be a dance instructor. Since there were no dance schools in Bay City at that time, Taylor opened her own. She moved to Sault Ste. Marie in 1900 to teach music. From there, she traveled to San Antonio, Texas, then she and a friend went to Mexico City to find work. Unsuccessful, she returned to Bay City.\n\nDesiring to secure her later years financially, she decided she would be the first person to ride over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Taylor used a custom-made barrel for her trip, constructed of oak and iron and padded with a mattress. Several delays occurred in the launching of the barrel, particularly because no one wanted to be part of potential suicide. Two days before Taylor's own attempt, a domestic cat was sent over the Horseshoe Falls in her barrel to test its strength to see if the barrel would break or not. Contrary to rumors at the time, the cat survived the plunge and seventeen minutes later, after she was found with a bleeding head, posed with Taylor in photographs.\nOn October 24, 1901, her 63rd birthday, the barrel was put over the side of a rowboat, and Taylor climbed in, along with her lucky heart-shaped pillow. After screwing down the lid, friends used a bicycle tire pump to compress the air in the barrel. The hole used for this was plugged with a cork, and Taylor was set adrift near the American shore, south of Goat Island.\n\nThe Niagara lake currents carried the barrel over the Canadian Horseshoe Falls, which has since been the site for all daredevil stunting at Niagara Falls. Rescuers reached her barrel shortly after the plunge. Taylor was discovered to be alive and relatively uninjured, except for a small gash on her head. The trip itself took less than twenty minutes, but it was some time before the barrel was actually opened. After the journey, Taylor told the press:\n\nIf it was with my dying breath, I would caution anyone against attempting the feat ... I would sooner walk up to the mouth of a cannon, knowing it was going to blow me to pieces than make another trip over the Fall.\n\nShe briefly earned money speaking about her experience but was never able to build much wealth. She wrote a memoir and returned to Niagara Falls to sell it. Her manager, Frank M. Russell, ran away with her barrel, and most of her savings were used towards private detectives hired to find it. It was eventually located in Chicago, only to permanently disappear some time later.\n\nShe spent her final years posing for photographs with tourists at her souvenir stand, attempting to earn money from the New York Stock Exchange, briefly talking about taking a second plunge over the cataracts in 1906, attempting to write a novel, re-constructing her 1901 plunge on film (which was never seen), working as a clairvoyant, and providing magnetic therapeutic treatments to local residents. \n\nTaylor died on April 29, 1921, aged 82, at the Niagara County Infirmary in Lockport, New York, and was interred next to English-born daredevil Carlisle D. Graham (1886–1905) in the \"Stunter's Rest\" section of Oakwood Cemetery in Niagara Falls, New York. Her funeral was held on the 5th of May, 1921. She attributed her bad health and near blindness to her trip over the falls.\n\n\n\n"}

Weiland was part of the Bruins' 1928 \"Dynamite Line\" with Dutch Gainor and Dit Clapper, one of the earliest \"named\" forward lines in NHL history.\n\nWeiland began playing junior hockey in Seaforth, where he spent three seasons with his hometown team. In 1923 he moved to Owen Sound, Ontario to attend school, planning a career as a druggist. He joined that city's junior team, the Owen Sound Greys, and led them to the 1924 Memorial Cup as Canadian champions. He was the club's top scorer with 68 goals in 25 games.\n\nAfter the Greys lost the 1925 OHA final to Toronto Aura Lee, Weiland began a three-year stint with the Minneapolis Millers of the old American Hockey Association. That led to the start of his NHL career with Boston, where he celebrated his rookie campaign in 1928–29 with a Stanley Cup victory over the New York Rangers. It was the first Cup win in Bruins history.\n\nIn his second season during 1929–30, he scored 43 goals and 73 points in 44 games. That year, the NHL allowed forward passing for the first time, but it did not create its offsides rule until December 1929. Weiland flourished under those conditions, shattering the NHL's single-season points record of 51 which had been set two years earlier by Montreal Canadiens legend Howie Morenz. Weiland held the record alone until 1942–43, when Doug Bentley of the Chicago Black Hawks tied it, and shared it for one more year—Boston's Herb Cain broke the record with 82 points in 1943–44.\n\nWeiland scored four goals in Boston's 7-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on February 25, 1930, becoming the third Bruin to achieve the feat.\n\nThe Bruins went to the Cup final again in 1930 but were swept by Montreal. Weiland had a brief career with Ottawa and played two seasons in Detroit, reaching the Cup final for a third time in 1934. One of his fellow Red Wings that year was Teddy Graham, an old teammate from the 1924 Greys. Weiland returned to Boston in 1935 and retired in 1939 with 173 goals and 333 points in 510 career games. But he ended his NHL playing career as he had begun it; the Bruins defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs and earned their second Stanley Cup.\n\nHe then stepped behind the bench as the club's new head coach and piloted Boston to its third Cup in 1940–41. Weiland helmed the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League for the next four seasons, then coached the league's New Haven entry for two more years. In 1950 he began his longest coaching stint, at Harvard University, where he compiled a record of 315-173-17 before retiring in 1971. That year also marked his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nA member of the Beanpot (ice hockey) Hall of Fame, Weiland was twice named coach of the year by the American Hockey Coaches Association, first in 1955, when he led the Crimson to third place in the NCAA tournament, and again in his final season, when his team captured the ECAC tournament. The New England Hockey Writers Association named Weiland its coach of the year five times and honored him with the Schaefer Pen Award for contribution to amateur hockey in 1962. He received the Lester Patrick Award for contribution to hockey in the United States in 1972.\n\nWeiland coached seven All-Americans, including three-time first-team selection Joe Cavanagh '71 and two-time pick David Johnston '63. His players earned a total of 26 first team All-Ivy honors, highlighted by the 1956–57 team, which was made up entirely of Crimson players.\n\nFour of Weiland's Harvard players helped the 1960 U.S. Olympic team win the gold medal in Squaw Valley. Among that group was the legendary Bill Cleary '56, who went on to assist Weiland and succeed him as head coach. Cleary served in that role for 19 seasons and as athletic director for 11. He earned the Hobey Baker Legend of College Hockey Award in 1993.\n\nCufflinks presented to Weiland after Owen Sound's Memorial Cup win in 1924 are part of a permanent junior hockey exhibit at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto.\n"}

Between 1993 and 1996, the bridge was repaired for the first time in a Railtrack-led project, which was partially funded by English Heritage.\n\nThe Royal Border Bridge was built by the Newcastle and Berwick Railway (N&BR), which was formed in 1845 under the control of George Hudson. The line was authorised by an Act of Parliament and construction had commenced by July 1845. Much of the line was completed within two years but work on several structures, including the Royal Border Bridge, had barely begun.\n\nThe line required the construction of several major structures and the Royal Border Bridge took the line over the River Tweed close to Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland. In 1847, Hudson was instrumental in the merger of the N&BR with the York and Newcastle Railway (Y&NR) to form the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway (YN&BR) whose line would eventually be continuous between London and Edinburgh.\n\nThe company's chief engineer was Robert Stephenson. Thomas Elliot Harrison engineered the route supervised by Stephenson who had a hands-on role in the design of the key bridges along the route, although some detailed work was performed by others.\n\nThe viaduct, which is built on a gentle curve, is a conventional masonry structure. It has 28 arches, 15 of which are over land south of the River Tweed and 13 over the river. The arches are set out in two groups separated by a stop pier. The bridge has brickwork soffits on the underside of the arches, and is covered by stone cladding. The bridge is at the deepest point of the riverbed. It is long and each arch span measures . The bridge contract covered a mile length including the earth embankments.\n\nOn 15 May 1847, the foundation stone for the bridge, which was called the \"Tweed Viaduct\", was laid. Cumberland-based McKay & Blackstock was appointed to built the bridge and George Barclay Bruce, a former apprentice of Stephenson's, was the resident engineer responsible for overseeing the day-to-day work. The Royal Border Bridge required of stone and the arch soffits required 2.5 million bricks. Techniques employed in the construction of Newcastle's High Level Bridge were used on the bridge. Upwards of 2,700 men were needed to build the bridge.\n\nThe bridge's deep foundation were driven into the bedrock, which was covered by about of gravel, using a patented Nasmyth steam-powered pile driver. The foundations were constructed inside deep cofferdams and steam-driven pumps kept out water.\n\nThe first elements completed were the 15 land arches and the stop pier which buttressed the remaining arches. The river piers were shaped at water level so that sheets of ice in the river would be broken up on contact and iron bars were embedded into the masonry for greater strength. These were covered by alterations made to accommodate an extra track.\n\nWhile the bridge was under construction, temporary timber viaducts were used by early train services and construction traffic. The line was opened before the Royal Border Bridge was completed. The bridge was scheduled to open in July 1849 but was not ready until March 1850. On 29 August 1850, the bridge was officially opened in a ceremony officiated by Queen Victoria, and Prince Albert and the Queen consented for it to be named the Royal Border Bridge.\n\nIn 1989, during the East Coast Main Line electrification programme, the bridge was modified by British Rail to accommodate electrification gantries. As the Royal Border Bridge had Grade 1 listed status, the overhead line infrastructure was designed for reduced visual impact and was approved by the Royal Fine Art Commission.\n\nAfter having stood for 143 years on the East Coast Main Line, the bridge underwent a maintenance programme in 1993. Restoration, focused on repairs to the 15 land-based arches, was undertaken as a joint project by Railtrack and English Heritage.\n\nIn early 2010, plans to install a night-time illumination scheme as a commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the death of Robert Stephenson were mooted. Scheduled to be operational by November 2010, weather conditions, particularly ice, damaged underwater cables, delaying the illumination preventing some lights from functioning. In January 2012, Northumberland County Council applied for a permanent lighting system to be installed. In 2016, the bridge was fitted with colour-changing lights; the installation was completed in time for the 160th anniversary.\n\n"}

{"id": "2027023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027023", "title": "Newbury bypass", "text": "Newbury bypass\n\nThe Newbury bypass, officially known as The Winchester-Preston Trunk Road (A34) (Newbury Bypass), is a stretch of dual carriageway road which bypasses the town of Newbury in Berkshire, England. It is located to the west of the town and forms part of the A34 road. It opened in 1998.\n\nBetween January 1996 and April 1996 the clearance of approximately of land including of woodland, and the felling of nearly 10,000 mature trees to make way for the construction of the road, led to some of the largest anti-road protests in European history. Around 7,000 people demonstrated on the site of the bypass route in some way and over 800 arrests were made. The cost of policing the protest (known as 'Operation Prospect' and run jointly by Thames Valley Police and Hampshire Constabulary) had reached approximately £5 million by December 1996. An additional £30 million was spent on private security guards, security fencing, and security lighting while the works were in progress, of which only £7 million was budgeted for in the original contract.\n\nThe protest was known in some quarters as the \"Third Battle of Newbury\", a name which was also adopted by one of the main protest groups. The name was chosen in reference to the English Civil War battles that took place close to the town in 1643 and 1644.\n\nNewbury has been on the route of north-south traffic across the River Kennet since the medieval period. A bridge on the site of the current Town Bridge has existed since at least the 14th century and the current bridge dates from 1772. As long ago as World War II this north-south traffic was considered to be of sufficient strategic importance that a second temporary bridge, the American Bridge, was built in case the Town Bridge was destroyed in an air raid. The American Bridge continued in use until it was replaced in 2001, but post-war traffic increases meant that the town centre and its bridges needed by-passing.\n\nThe first Newbury bypass was built in 1963; however by the 1980s this in turn proved insufficient to cope with the huge volume of traffic travelling through the Newbury area. In 1981 a new road to be built to the west of Newbury, mainly following the path of the disused Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway railway line, was proposed to bypass the town centre. This route was very controversial because it ran through three Sites of Special Scientific Interest — Snelsmore Common plus the Rivers Lambourn and Kennet; Penn Wood which was part of the North Wessex Downs AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty); the English Heritage registered battlefield site of the first Battle of Newbury during the English Civil War in 1643; and The Chase, a National Trust nature reserve. It was also found that areas of the proposed bypass route were home to a rare snail, known as Desmoulin's whorl snail.\n\nA public inquiry into the plans was held in 1988, which found in favour of the road. Opponents argued that the decision was flawed and possibly illegal as there was no Environmental Impact Assessment — a legal requirement incorporated into British law two weeks after the start of the 1988 public enquiry. However, the inquiry decision was made in accordance with legislation at the time. The plans were passed in a closed session of Parliament, after a pro forma hearing, which opponents criticised as a \"lack of democracy\".\n\nThe road was originally approved for construction to begin in 1994. However, the then Secretary of State for Transport, Brian Mawhinney, announced that it would be delayed pending a further review. On 5 July 1995 Mawhinney announced that the building of the road was to proceed and then resigned half an hour later.\n\nThe bypass led to immense protests in an attempt to halt the felling of trees (including mature oak, ash, and beech) and the start of building work. A number of protesters were veterans from the Twyford Down protests over the building of the M3 motorway. Others were students, unemployed people, part-time workers and people taking time off from work to protest. In 1994, a local comprehensive school teacher, Helen Anscombe, founded \"The Third Battle of Newbury\", an umbrella group of organisations against the bypass. The name actually came from a meeting held by local townspeople and was the suggestion of a name by a local historian who cared deeply that the battlefields of the Civil War stayed safe to visitors.\n\nAlthough the majority of local residents were in favour of building the bypass, a sizeable minority were against it. A protest group of local businesses opposed to the building of the road was formed, which named itself 'CAMBUS'. The split of opinion in and around Newbury concerning the building of the road was regularly demonstrated in the lively debate seen in the letters page of the local newspaper, the \"Newbury Weekly News\".\n\nClearance work began on 2 August 1995 when bulldozers demolished six empty buildings in the path of the bypass – three houses, a railway signal box, a lodge at Mary Hare Grammar School for deaf children and a prefabricated church near Snelsmore Common.\n\nFrom July 1995 protesters began to occupy the land that was scheduled for clearance, a tactic known as tree sitting, in an effort to stop the felling of trees. Many lived in tree houses, which were also known as 'twigloos', while others occupied home-made tents on the ground made from hazel branches covered with tarpaulin known as 'benders'.\n\nThe first camp was at Snelsmore Common. Around September 1995 a further encampment grew up alongside the Kennet and Avon Canal and the River Kennet. Around October 1995 protesters set up a third encampment at Reddings Copse. By December 1995 there were three further camps at The Chase, Elmore Plantation and Rack Marsh on the River Lambourn. Protesters in many of the camps claimed squatters rights through use of a Section 6 notice.\n\nAnother method used by protesters to stop the clearance work was the digging of tunnels, a tactic borrowed from the Viet Cong. A network of tunnels down was dug at Snelsmore Common in the belief that heavy machinery would not drive over them in case they collapsed, burying the protesters inside.\n\nEvictions of the protest camps, tree felling and undergrowth clearance work begin on 9 January 1996 and conflicts between security guards and protesters were widely reported in the British media. By the following month the number of protesters had increased and there were more than 20 camps along the route of the bypass, with names such as 'Skyward', 'Rickety Bridge', 'Granny Ash', 'Quercus Circus', 'Sea View', 'Babble Brook', 'Radical Fluff', 'Pixie Village' and 'Heartbreak Hotel'. Peter Faulding was called in by the authorities to plan and safely remove the environmental protesters from a network of tunnels along the proposed route of the Newbury Bypass.\n\nA firm specialising in industrial rope access, Richard Turner Ltd, was hired to provide climbers to evict protesters from the trees. Professional climbers condemned the actions of the company, questioning the safety of the procedures they were using. They presented the company with a special 'downside' award at the first British Mountain Festival held at Llandudno on 17 February 1996. Andy MacNae of the British Mountaineering Council said \"Climbers have an enviable environmental record, and the vast majority will be outraged at being associated with actions of this kind.\" Climber and writer Jim Perrin said \"If we, as a community, do not disown and ostracise these mercenaries and renegades, we are undermining the reason for our own existence and helping accelerate the destruction of places we hold most dear\".\n\nOn Monday 29 January there was a public meeting at the Waterside Centre in Newbury organised jointly by Friends of the Earth and the Green Party to promote the Road Traffic Reduction Bill. At the meeting, environmentalist and broadcaster Dr David Bellamy addressed the crowd of around 400 people and voiced his opposition to the building of the bypass.\n\nOn 15 February 1996 around 5,000 people from around the UK marched for along the route from the largest camp at Snelsmore Common to Bagnor in objection to the road. Environmentalists claimed that this was the largest ever single demonstration against road-building in Britain. Two of the marchers were the television presenters Johnny Morris and Maggie Philbin, who lived nearby. The protest was peaceful and there were no arrests.\n\nA national poll published in the \"Newbury Weekly News\" (10 March 1996) found that 53% of respondents thought that \"work should stop immediately to allow time for alternatives to be tried\".\n\nDespite the protests, site clearance and road construction proceeded under heavy security provided by the Thames Valley Police led by the Assistant Chief Constable Ian Blair, the Hampshire Constabulary, and private security firms. The road was eventually finished after thirty-four months in November 1998 and now provides a high-speed section of the A34. It cost £104 million, against an original contract price of £74 million. The Highways Agency blamed the cost blow-out on the protesters.\n\nMuch of the aggregate used in the by-pass was from the decommissioned RAF Greenham Common. The runway, once one of the largest in Europe was broken up and removed (except for one centre section) as part of the effort to return the common to its former state.\n\nThe concrete structures on the bypass received the Concrete Society's Overall Award for Outstanding Structures in 1999.\n\nFollowing the extensive protests over the construction of the road, environmental concerns became much more of an important issue to civil engineers. The Newbury bypass itself was built with extra environmental features in an attempt to reduce the impact of the road.\n\nThe Desmoulin's whorl snail colony, previously located at Rack Marsh in Bagnor, was moved to another location to allow construction of the road to go ahead. However, in July 2006 it was reported that the species had become locally extinct at the new site.\n\nAnalysis since the construction of the bypass has shown that instead of the predicted 47% reduction in road deaths due to the new road, there was a 67% increase (from 6 to 10) in the five years after it opened. However, the total number of casualties fell by 32% (from 455 to 311).\n\nThe same report concluded that the levels of traffic on the old road had not fallen as much as might have been expected, possibly because of traffic being able to use it for other reasons. In 2006, the Highways Agency defended the scheme from allegations by the Campaign to Protect Rural England that traffic had returned to previous levels: the Highways Agency's rejoinder being that the road had reduced traffic problems in the town.\n\nIn January 2016, a BBC magazine article commemorating the events of 20 years earlier showed 200,000 new trees starting to mature and the mutual respect but not affection between the former protagonists. One of the protesters, Rebecca Lush (since working for the Campaign for Better Transport) claimed the protest had enabled the incoming Labour government to look at alternatives to building more roads.\n\nMusician and activist Julian Cope was a frequent visitor to the camps and would document many of the protesters struggles in his album Interpreter.\n\nThe English band New Model Army commemorated the conflict in its song \"Snelsmore Wood\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2027031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027031", "title": "Nobber", "text": "Nobber\n\nNobber ( – referring to a moat around a Norman castle) is a village in north County Meath, Ireland. The village is located near a river called the Dee () and near Whitewood Lake, which is situated in the townland of Whitewood. It is on the Navan–Kingscourt road (R162) about north of Navan. This places the village about from the M50 motorway ; the orbital motorway of Dublin. The town of Kells is to the west and the town of Ardee to the east and the town of Kingscourt is to the north. Villages that border the parish are Kilmainhamwood, Moynalty and Kilbeg to the west, Castletown to the south and Drumconrath and Lobinstown to the east.\n\nThe Normans were the first known people to settle at Nobber. The site acted as a strong-point on the road from the ports of Drogheda and Dundalk to the midlands. The Lordship of Meath was granted to Hugh De Lacy by King Henry II of England in 1172 in his capacity as Lord of Ireland. De Lacy granted the Barony of Morgallion to Gilbert de Angulo, who constructed a moate and bailey there. Around 2005 several high crosses were discovered in the village's old cemetery (St Johns) dating from possibly the 10th century. These are smaller and less ornate than typical Celtic high crosses. This find is significant because it suggests that a hitherto unrecorded monastic settlement once existed on the site of the village. Moynagh Lake, to the west of the village, is the site of a multi-period crannóg which dates to Mesolithic times. In the Medieval period, Nobber was the chief town of the Barony of Morgallion, and was variously expressed as \"\"\"\".\n\nNobber was once a key town in the Kingdom of Meath, and an ancient 'Rectory of Nobber' was united to the ecclesiastical dignity of Archdeacon of Kells, thus the holder was styled \"Rector of Nobber\", \"Parson of Nobber\", or more often 'Archdeacon of Nobber'. Confusingly, the Archdeacon of Kells held the \"Rectory of Nobber\", while the Archdeacon of Meath held the \"Rectory of Kells\".\n\nA disused railway line dating from 1875, running from Kingscourt to Navan, runs through the village. This was purchased by the Midland Great Western Railway in 1888. Until recent years it operated to haul gypsum from Saint-Gobain Gypsum Industries plant in County Cavan to the port of Drogheda. Nobber railway station opened on 1 November 1872, closed for passenger traffic on 27 January 1947 and finally closed altogether on 1 April 1963.\n\nBus Éireann route 107 links Nobber to Navan and Kingscourt. Sillan also provide a link to Navan and Dublin with some buses extending to University College Dublin. In the other direction Sillan services provide a link to Kingscourt, Shercock and Cootehill.\n\nThe village has two schools: Nobber National school for primary school children and O'Carolan College which is a comprehensive secondary school. The church of Saint John the Baptist is the Roman Catholic church in the centre of the village which also has a fire station, Garda Síochána (police) station.\n\nNobber has only one Gaelic Football team called Nobber G.F.C. In 2003, Nobber won the All-Ireland Junior Club Football Championship, beating Kilmeena of Mayo. Nobber are three time Meath Intermediate Football Champions, having won honours in 1980, 2010 and 2019. Having won the 2019 Meath Intermediate Football Championship, as of 2020, Nobber compete in the Meath Senior Football Championship.\n\nThe local soccer team are Electro Celtic FC who (as of 2012) were competing in Division 3B of the Meath and District League.\n\nThe Nobber Fair Day is an annual event that is held on the third Sunday of May. The event has been running since 2006, and revived an old tradition of a fair that was held in the village for centuries. Rare breeds of farm animals are displayed, and rosettes and prizes are awarded across various categories. In 2012, more than 10,000 people attended Nobber Fair Day.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Westwick, nicknamed the \"Rat\" by a journalist, is most noted for his play with the Ottawa Hockey Club, nicknamed the \"Silver Seven\" during his day which won and defended the Stanley Cup from 1903 until 1906. He was a member of the Ottawa Capitals lacrosse team from 1896 until 1904, winning three championships. His brother Tom was also a professional ice hockey player.\n\nWestwick, who played during a period when hockey players received little or no money, also worked as a book binder for various companies, and later, the Canadian government printing bureau. He enlisted in the Army in 1914 during World War I. When he married his wife Ruby Duval (sister of former Ottawa team mate Peg Duval) in February 1903, he combined his honeymoon with a team trip to Montreal. During the game, he suffered a broken ankle and watched the rest of the game from an arena seat with his bride. Ruby and Harry had six children: Bill, Thomas, Barberry, Elaine, Ula and Beatrice. His son Bill became the sports editor of the \"Ottawa Journal\". Westwick died at home in Ottawa on April 3, 1957.\n\nBorn in Ottawa, Ontario, Westwick played hockey for Ottawa teams, joining the intermediate Ottawa Aberdeens of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) in 1893. He moved up to the senior-level Ottawa Hockey Club the next season. At the time, Ottawa had lost its goaltender Albert Morel and Westwick played several games as goaltender before moving up to rover on the advice of a coach who saw his fast skating ability. During the summer, Westwick would play for the Ottawa Capitals in lacrosse. The Capitals, ostensibly an amateur team, were discovered to be paying players in 1896 and Westwick was suspended from ice hockey play. Westwick would deny receiving any money and he was reinstated by Ottawa in 1898, only to be suspended again in 1898 by the Canadian Amateur Athletic Union. In 1899, Westwick moved out of town to find work in Waterloo, Ontario but returned to Ottawa in time to play some games for the Capitals ice hockey team, by then playing in Ontario Hockey Association (OHA).\n\nIn 1900–01, Westwick returned to the Ottawa Hockey Club, and he played for the club until 1908, and was a member of the four-time Stanley Cup winning squad later dubbed the \"Silver Seven\" for receiving silver nuggets for their 1903 Stanley Cup win. Westwick's best season was in 1905, when he scored 15 goals in eight regular season games, and 5 goals in the Dawson City challenge series. In 1906–07, his brother Tom joined the Ottawa squad, starting one game. By 1909, Westwick's skating ability had been reduced by a series of ankle injuries and he did not make the 1909 Ottawa squad. He played the season for the Ottawa Senators of the Federal League, a professional team which had several former Silver Seven players. It was his last season.\n\nOn one occasion, after ice hockey had become professional in 1906, Westwick played for a team other than Ottawa. He joined the Stanley Cup champion Kenora Thistles in 1907 after the Ottawa's 1907 season was complete. He played the final games of the Thistles' season and played in the Thistles defence of its Stanley Cup win against the Montreal Wanderers, at the time, the arch-rival of Ottawa. While the Thistles defended their Cup win in Manitoba play with Westwick, his appearance with the Thistles caused the challenge series with the Wanderers to be protested by the Wanderers and a cancellation was threatened by the Stanley Cup trustees. The series, held in Winnipeg, was beyond the reach of the trustees, and went ahead. The Wanderers won the series, making the protest moot. The following year, the trustees implemented the January 1 rule, where only players on a team as of January 1 of the season were eligible for Stanley Cup play.\nWestwick remained involved in hockey, becoming a referee in the National Hockey Association (NHL) after retiring from active play. In 1915–16, at a time when many players were off fighting in World War I, Westwick helped out Ottawa in a comeback role, playing three games, although he did not score any goals.\n\nHis nickname 'Rat' was from a Quebec City journalist, who in 1896 called Westwick a \"miserable, insignificant rat.' Westwick's scrappiness led opponents to resort to aggressive (and somewhat violent) tactics in order to derail his tenacious playing style. His ankle injuries necessitated the amputation of his left leg above the knee in 1949. Westwick was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\n\nSource: Hockey Hall of Fame, \"Who's Who in Canadian Sport\".\n\n"}

Smith's in turn was purchased by PepsiCo and began to relabel the Thins brand jointly with Pepsi's own brand of thin potato chips, Lay's. They were sold under the moniker \"Thins: now known internationally as Lay's\". Smith's later sold Thins to Snack Foods Limited, while continuing to produce their own line of potato chips under the \"Lay's\" brand name.

Grayling, is a British philosopher and author. He was born in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and spent most of his childhood there and in Nyasaland (now Malawi). In 2011 he founded and became the first Master of New College of the Humanities, an independent undergraduate college in London. Until June 2011, he was Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London, where he taught from 1991. He is also a supernumerary fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford.\n\nGrayling is the author of about 30 books on philosophy, biography, history of ideas, human rights and ethics, including \"The Refutation of Scepticism\" (1985), \"The Future of Moral Values\" (1997), \"Wittgenstein\" (1992), \"What Is Good?\" (2000), \"The Meaning of Things\" (2001), \"The Good Book\" (2011), \"The God Argument\" (2013), \"The Age of Genius: The Seventeenth Century and the Birth of the Modern Mind\" (2016) and \"Democracy and its Crises\" (2017).\n\nHe was a trustee of the London Library and a fellow of the World Economic Forum, and is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and the Royal Society of Arts. For a number of years he was a columnist for \"The Guardian\" newspaper, and presented the BBC World Service series \"Exchanges at the Frontier\" on science and society. In 2013 he was awarded the Forkosch Literary Prize, and in 2015 he received the Bertrand Russell Award.\n\nGrayling was a director and contributor at \"Prospect\" magazine from its foundation until 2016. He is a vice-president of Humanists UK and honorary associate of the National Secular Society, and Patron of the Defence Humanists. His main academic interests lie in epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophical logic and he has published works in these subjects. His political affiliations lie on the centre-left, and he has defended human rights and politically liberal values in print and by activism. He is associated in Britain with other new atheists. He appears in British media discussing philosophy and public affairs.\n\nGrayling was born and raised in Luanshya, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), within the British expatriate enclave, and raised there and in Nyasaland (now Malawi) where his father worked for the Standard Bank. He attended several boarding schools, including Falcon College in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), from which he ran away after being regularly caned. His first exposure to philosophical writing was at the age of twelve, when he found an English translation of the \"Charmides\", one of Plato's dialogues, in a local library. At age fourteen, he read G. H. Lewes's \"Biographical History of Philosophy\" (1846), which confirmed his ambition to study philosophy; he said it \"superinduced order on the random reading that had preceded it, and settled my vocation\".\n\nGrayling had an elder sister Jennifer and brother John. When he was 19 years old, his elder sister Jennifer was murdered in Johannesburg. She had been born with brain damage, and after brain surgery to alleviate it at the age of 20 had experienced personality problems that led to emotional difficulties and a premature marriage. She was found dead in a river shortly after the marriage; she had been stabbed. When her parents went to identify her, her mother—already ill—had a heart attack and died. Grayling said he dealt with his grief by becoming a workaholic.\n\nAfter moving to England in his teens, he spent three years at the University of Sussex, but said that although he applauded their intention to educate generalists, he wished to be a scholar, so in addition to his BA from Sussex, he also completed one in philosophy as a University of London external student. He went on to obtain an MA from Sussex, then attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was taught by P. F. Strawson and A. J. Ayer, obtaining his doctorate in 1981 for a thesis on \"Epistemological Scepticism and Transcendental Arguments\". A part of that thesis is published as The Refutation of Scepticism (1985) and its themes are further developed in Scepticism and the Possibility of Knowledge (2008) \n\nGrayling lectured in philosophy at Bedford College, London and St Anne's College, Oxford, before taking up a post in 1991 at Birkbeck, University of London, where in 1998 he became reader in philosophy, and in 2005 professor. In addition to his work on Berkeley, philosophical logic, the theory of knowledge, and the history of ideas, the latter including (as chief editor) the four-volume \"The Continuum Encyclopedia of British Philosophy\", he wrote and edited several pedagogical works in philosophy, including \"An Introduction to Philosophical Logic\" (3rd ed., 1999) and the two volumes \"Philosophy: A Guide Through the Subject\" (1995) and \"Philosophy: Further Through the Subject\" (1998).\n\nIn his philosophical work, Grayling connected solutions to the problem of scepticism in epistemology with the questions about assertibility and the problem of meaning in the philosophy of language and logic. A principal theme in his work is that considerations of metaphysics, which relate to what exists, has to be kept separate from the two connected questions of the relation of thought to its objects in the variety of domains over which thought ranges, and the mastery of discourses about those domains, where a justificationist approach is required.\n\nGrayling resigned from Birkbeck in June 2011 to found and become the first master of New College of the Humanities, an independent undergraduate college in London. In February 2019, Northeastern University, a private research university in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, purchased the New College of the Humanities. He is a Supernumerary Fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford. He was a judge on the Man Booker prize 2003 and Chairman of the Judges for the 2014 Man Booker Prize. He has also been a judge on the Wellcome Trust Book Prize and the Art Fund prize.\n\nGrayling was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to philosophy.\n\nFor Grayling, work on technical problems is only one aspect of philosophy. Another aspect, one which has been at the centre of philosophy's place in history, has more immediate application to daily life: the questions of ethics, which revolve upon what Grayling calls the great Socratic question, 'How should one live?'. In pursuit of what he describes as 'contributing to the conversation society has with itself about possibilities for good lives in good societies', Grayling writes widely on contemporary issues, including war crimes, the legalisation of drugs, euthanasia, secularism, human rights and other topics in the tradition of Polemics. He has articulated positions on humanist ethics and on the history and nature of concepts of liberty as applied in civic life. In support of his belief that the philosopher should engage in public debate, he brings these philosophical perspectives to issues of the day in his work as a writer and as a commentator on radio and television.\n\nAmong his contributions to the discussion about religion in contemporary society he argues that there are three separable, though naturally connected debates:\nOn this last point, Grayling's view is that for historical reasons religions have an inflated place in the public domain out of all proportion to the numbers of their adherents or their intrinsic merits, so that their voice and influence is amplified disproportionately: with the result that they can distort such matters as public policy (e.g. on abortion) and science research and education (e.g. stem cells, teaching of evolution). He argues that winning the metaphysical and ethical debates is already abating the problems associated with (c) in more advanced Western societies, even the US. He sees his own major contribution as being the promotion of understanding of humanist ethics deriving from the philosophical tradition.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2002 Grayling wrote a weekly column in \"The Guardian\" called \"The Last Word\", on a different topic every week. In these columns, which also formed the basis of a series of books for a general readership, commencing with \"The Meaning of Things\" in 2001, Grayling made the basics of philosophy available to the layperson. He is a regular contributor to \"The Guardian's\" \"Comment is free\" group blog, and writes columns for, among others, the \"Prospect\" and \"New Scientist\" magazines.\n\nGrayling is accredited with the United Nations Human Rights Council, and is a patron of Humanists UK, an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society, patron of the Defence Humanists, was a Trustee of the London Library, and a board member of the Society of Authors and an Honorary Patron of The Philosophy Foundation, a charity whose aim is to bring philosophy to the wider community, and particularly to disadvantaged schools. In 2003 he was a Booker Prize judge and Chairman of the Judges for the 2014 Man Booker Prize. In 2005, Grayling debated with Christian philosopher William Lane Craig on whether God can exist in an evil world.\n\nGrayling's book on the , \"Among the Dead Cities: Was the Allied Bombing of Civilians in WWII a Necessity or a Crime?\" (2006) was well-received as a contribution to the debate on the ethics of war. In September 2010, Grayling was one of 55 public figures who sent a letter to \"The Guardian\" expressing their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK. In August 2014, Grayling was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to \"The Guardian\" opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.\n\nA. C. Grayling was one of the contributors to the book, \"We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples\", released in October 2009. The book explores the cultures of peoples around the world, portraying both their diversity and the threats they face. Other contributors included not only western writers, such as Laurens van der Post, Noam Chomsky, Claude Lévi-Strauss, but also indigenous people, such as Davi Kopenawa Yanomami and Roy Sesana. The royalties from the sale of this book go to the indigenous rights organisation, Survival International.\n\nIn recent years Grayling has been campaigning against the UK Government's response to the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum result. In his book, \"Democracy and Its Crisis\", Grayling argues that voting systems must be reformed to prevent certain results, such as Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. Grayling has tweeted that Brexit must be made to disappear like a \"nasty, temporary, hiccup, soon forgotten\".\n\nGrayling lives in central London. His former wife, novelist Katie Hickman, and he have a daughter, Madeleine, and he has two adult children from his first marriage, Jolyon and Georgina.\n\n\n\nForeword to Shyam Wuppuluri, N. C.

Whitcroft played for several notable amateur and early professional hockey squads, including the Renfrew Creamery Kings, Edmonton Eskimos and Kenora Thistles.\n\nEarly in his career, Whitcroft made a name for himself in hockey circles with his outstanding amateur play with the Peterborough Colts. In 1907 the Stanley Cup champion Kenora Thistles signed him to a $700 contract. While with the Thistles, the team defeated Brandon to retain the Stanley Cup. The club next played a challenge with the Montreal Wanderers. The Wanderers defeated the Thistles in a two game, total points series by the score of 12–8, avenging their loss to the Thistles earlier in the season.\n\nThe following year Whitcroft signed a contract to play with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Alberta Professional Hockey League. While with Edmonton, Whitcroft scored six goals in a game, five goals in a game three times and four times in a game once. Whitcroft led the league two years running in goals scored. Edmonton played in one Stanley Cup challenge in 1908, coming up against the Wanderers, losing 13-10 on goals in a two-game series. After the Edmonton team disbanded in December 1909, Whitcroft jumped back east and signed with the National Hockey Association's Renfrew Creamery Kings for $2,000. Among his teammates were Hockey Hall of Famers Cyclone Taylor, Frank Patrick, Lester Patrick, and Newsy Lalonde, on a team dubbed the Renfrew Millionaires. After one season playing for the Millionaires, Whitcroft retired from playing. He coached the Edmonton Dominions to the Alberta championship in 1913–14.\n\nTaking up gold prospecting after his hockey career was over, Whitcroft died of a heart attack in northern British Columbia in August, 1931. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962.\n"}

The ad featured a man on a bicycle delivering chips to various people. He would hit the front brake at the last moment, performing an 'endo' as he came to an abrupt stop. He'd then present the pink bag of \"Salt and Vinegar Samboy\" chips, before immediately cycling off hastily, pulling a 'mono' as he left.

{"id": "2027070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027070", "title": "Citicar", "text": "Citicar\n\nThe CitiCar is an electric car produced between 1974 and 1977 by a U.S. company called Sebring-Vanguard, Inc., based in Sebring, Florida. Sebring-Vanguard was sold to Commuter Vehicles, Inc., which produced similar vehicles (the Comuta-Car and Comuta-Van) from 1979 to 1982. Its exterior design lives on in the Norwegian Kewet. Accounting for all CitiCar variants, a total of 4,444 units were produced up to 1979, the most since 1945 for an electric car assembled in North America until surpassed by the Tesla Model S.\n\nInspired by Club Car's golf cart design and partly in response to the 1970s fuel crisis, a company called Sebring-Vanguard produced its first electric vehicle, the Vanguard Coupe (sometimes referred to as the EV Coupe), in 1974. Company founder and President Robert G. Beaumont, working with designer Jim Muir, came up with the CitiCar after this earlier EV Coupe was not an immediate success. This second attempt was still based on a lot of the Club Car's mechanical features, though.\n\nProduced in its plant in Sebring, Florida, the CitiCar was a small wedge-shaped electric vehicle. Early versions had no extra features and can be considered an experiment in minimalist automotive design; it was as basic a people mover as could be bought at the time. By 1976, enough CitiCars were produced to promote Sebring-Vanguard to the position of being the U.S. #6 auto manufacturer after GM, Ford, Chrysler, AMC, and Checker Motors Corporation; but ahead of Excalibur and Avanti Motors. Production of the CitiCar continued until 1977 with about 2,300 CitiCars produced.\n\nCommuter Vehicles, Inc. purchased the CitiCar design, and renamed the vehicle Comuta-Car. Production of this upgraded version began in 1979 and Commuter Vehicles, Inc. produced an estimated 2,144 Comuta-Cars and Vans.\n\nThe CitiCar came in three models. All three models had a flat diagonal front, a flat roof, and a flat nearly vertical back. Early coupes, designated as model SV-36, had a 2.5 HP motor and 36v battery pack. The second model coupes, designated as model SV-48, had a 3.5 HP motor and 48v battery pack, and some small improvements. During the last years of production, the third model variant of the Citicar, sometimes referred to as a Transitional CitiCar or 1976 1/2 model, had an improved drive train with a 6 HP motor, and the body was changed slightly to incorporate heater inlet vents on the side of the vehicle and some had the improved door style with better latches and permanently installed sliding windows.\nThe later Comuta-Car, produced by Commuter Vehicles, Inc. retained all of the Transitional CitiCar changes including the larger 6 HP motor and drive train arrangement, but moved the batteries from under the seat to battery boxes behind the bumpers, making the vehicle about longer than the long CitiCar. ComutaCars also incorporated additional frame supports to meet the new DOT standards. One of these supports created the center console like rug covered divider between the driver and passenger.\n\nThe CitiVan, was a limited production extended-wheelbase version of the third model variant of the CitiCar. Produced and sold from 1977 (by Sebring-Vanguard) to 1979 (by Commuter Vehicles, Inc.), basically unchanged. It is rumored that only 11 of these smaller Vans were built and sold as the CitiVan but an unknown more were built and sold in 1979 as the first year Comuta-Van. The main design differences between the 1979 Comuta-Van and the later Postal Comuta-Van is that the much smaller 1979 Comuta-Van has swing out side doors and a hatch back window. The much larger Postal Comuta-Van has sliding side doors and a swing out rear entrance door.\n\nAnother CitiCar variant was called the Postal Comuta-Van. These were all right-hand-drive vehicles, initially built as a government contract with the USPS by Commuter Vehicles, Inc.. To make a Comuta-Van to meet government standards, the overall length was increased to , as well as a 12 HP motor, 72v battery pack, and 3-speed transmission, among other additions. The Postal version was only equipped with one 'right hand' drivers seat. However, some were sold to the public with an additional passenger seat and much more room for storage behind the seats. It was the only model with a front hood access and sliding side doors.\nAll vehicles were built with space frames made from welded aircraft grade aluminum tube and ABS plastic bodies. They all had solid axles with leaf spring suspension front and rear. Top speeds were about - , and range was up to per charge.\n\nThe second model of the CitiCar (SV-48):\n\nNOTE: The top speed of any particular C-Car will vary somewhat depending on many factors, including: tire pressure, vehicle weight, alignment, brake drag, windows open/closed, transaxle oil viscosity, temperature, chemistry, age, condition of the batteries, force of possible headwinds/tailwinds, etc. These factors can make some C-Cars a bit faster or slower than others.\nApproximate top speeds expected with a Citicar on level ground:<br>\n36v – to (original SV-36 – six 6v batteries)<br>\n48v – to (original SV-48 – eight 6v batteries)\n\n\nPrior to car #1501, CitiCars left the factory as 36 volt models; most had a 2.5 hp Baldor motor, but a few had the 3.5 hp GE motor.\n\nIn December 1974, CitiCar number #1501 (124SR1501) was the first factory-built 48 volt CitiCar. These vehicles were designated as model SV-48, compared to the earlier SV-36. All CitiCars made after this vehicle were produced as 48 volt models with the newer 3.5 hp GE series motor. \n\nCitiCar #1751 (March 1975) saw a number of changes to the assembly line. Here is a list of changes at car #1751 –\n\nThe turn signal switch change required a number of other changes –\n\n\nIn addition, there were a number of technical improvements –\n\nAfter the changes at car #1751, there was a minor glitch noted in the service manual. Since a lamp was removed from the instrument panel, there were fewer lamps, and the dimmer would not allow the lamps to go all the way off. \n\nBefore car #2011 (May 1975), the CitiCar had front disc brakes. Cars #2011 and after had drum brakes. \n\nOn car #2080 (May 1975), the parking brake micro switch was moved to a different position, and was actuated by a plastic collar instead of a detent on the parking brake shaft. \n\nOn car #2211 (July 1975), a switch was added to the dual master cylinder along with a small PC board behind the dash to warn of problems with brake hydraulics, as well as indicating if the parking brake is engaged. Before #2211, the brake lamp was a parking brake engaged indicator only. \n\nPrior to car #2426 (September 1975) the accelerator was returned to off via a single accelerator spring. Sebring-Vanguard issued a Service Note to modify all previous vehicles to add another spring. After #2426, a dual spring accelerator pedal was standard.\n\nAround December 1975 there was another major change in the CitiCar assembly line. All CitiCars #2781 and higher were equipped with a 5.17:1 ratio Dana/Spicer rear axle and a 6 hp GE motor. There was an optional 'hilly' Dana/Spicer axle with a higher ratio also available for these cars which allowed better hill climbing performance, but at the cost of a slightly lower top speed. These vehicles are also known as 'Transitional' Citicars.\n\nAdditional changes with car #2781 - \n\n\nOn car #2842 (December 1975), a micro switch was added to the foot brake to prevent the accelerator from functioning when the brake was pressed. \n\nOn car #2854 (December 1975), the horn voltage was increased back to 18v.\n\nCitiCar frame numbers are believed to start at 1001, and end around 3000. To date, (May 2013) the lowest CitiCar frame number known to exist is #1040, and the highest CitiCar frame number known to exist is #2998. The small number of CitiVans produced used a separate serial number sequence.\n\nThe Comuta-Cars produced as 1979 models share the VIN arrangement of earlier CitiCars, but end with an 'A' suffix. These \"A\" model vehicle frame numbers were interspersed within the CitiCar series between 2000 and 2300, but do not appear to duplicate any CitiCar production. There is speculation that these frames may have been unsold dealer stock that was included in the bankruptcy sale to Commuter Vehicles, Inc. Model 'A' Comuta-Cars are configured like other Comuta-Cars (batteries in bumpers, Dana axle, heater vents, sliding windows, etc.) Some Transitional CitiCars produced after June 1976 have serial numbers ending with the \"A\" suffix as well. It is believed that these also may have been unsold earlier dealer stock, that was upgraded to the 1976 1/2 Transitional Model standards (Dana axle, heater vents, sliding windows, etc.)\n\nAlthough production of the CitiCar stopped in 1977, and production of the Comuta-Car stopped in 1982, a Service Bulletin was issued in September 1984 to change the 3-speed contactor setup for a solid state controller.\n\nThere are some indications that after January 1982, a few Comuta-Cars may have been sold as home assembly kits for off road or to be registered as Home Built EV’s in the buyer’s state.\n\nThe last known Comuta vehicle to be factory built was a special order 72 V DC Pick-Up in 1986. This vehicle was sold without a serial number and only lacked windshield wipers and directional signals to meet DOT road worthiness.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the earliest LDS Church missionaries to Asia, and was one of the leaders of the Mormon pioneer Willie Handcart Company.\n\nSavage was the second of 15 children born in Greenfield, Huron County, Ohio to Levi Savage Sr. and Polly Haynes. He grew up on a farm in southern Michigan, where he had some schooling. During his lifetime, Savage was a teamster, soldier, teacher, pioneer, and missionary to India and Burma. He spent the remaining years of his life as a farmer in southern Utah. Savage kept a detailed journal from October 6, 1852 to March 16, 1903.\n\nIn the early 1840s, Savage's parents joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The family moved from Michigan to Nauvoo, Illinois, and later migrated as Mormon pioneers to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847.\n\nDuring the move from Nauvoo to Salt Lake City, Savage enlisted in the U.S. Army as a part of the Mormon Battalion. His enlistment began in July 1846 in Company D of the battalion. The battalion marched 1,400 miles from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to San Diego, California.\n\nSavage's family was a part of the June 18, 1847, Abraham O. Smoot/George B. Wallace wagon train company. His mother, Polly, died on the trek to Utah. Savage learned of his mother's death after he finished his enlistment with the Mormon Battalion. Savage arrived in Salt Lake City via San Diego on October 16, 1847, three weeks after the family.\n\nSavage married Jane Mathers on January 23, 1848. Jane had crossed the plains as the cook for Savage's parents. Their only child, Levi Mathers Savage, was born on January 11, 1851. Jane died on December 29, 1852, leaving Levi Jr. to raise their infant.\n\nOn July 10, 1856, Savage was in Iowa City, Iowa, where he joined the ill-fated Willie handcart company that was migrating to Salt Lake City. He was appointed as a sub-captain in the company. At a tense meeting in Florence, Nebraska on August 13, 1856, Savage was asked for his views and told the group that he firmly believed that embarking West so late in the season was dangerous. When overruled Savage reportedly said, \"What I have said I know to be true; but seeing you are to go forward, I will go with you, will help all I can, will work with you, will rest with you, and if necessary, will die with you. May God in his mercy bless and preserve us.\" William Woodward, a captain of the company, later wrote, \"Levi Savage, who was censured for his truthful statement at Florence, was I think the best help we had—resolute & determined his whole soul was for the salvation of our company.\" Over one-fifth of the group died from freezing and starvation before they arrived in Salt Lake City on November 9, 1856.\n\nAfter returning to Salt Lake City with the ill-fated pioneers, Savage married Ann Brummel Cooper, a member of the Willie handcart company he helped rescue. He later also married two of Ann Brummel Cooper's daughters, Mary Ann Cooper, and Adelaide Cooper, although he only had children with Mary Ann. Savage married Ann Brummel Cooper on October 31, 1858. At the time of the marriage, Ann's daughter Adelaide was 6 years of age (b. Nov. 28, 1851). Mary Ann was 8 (b. Nov. 22, 1849). Savage later married Adelaide when he was 48 and she was 16 (m. October 17, 1868). One week later he married his other step-daughter, Mary Ann (m. October 24, 1868). She was 18. From the marriage with Mary Ann were born three children, William, Riley, and Clara.\n\nIn October 1852, Savage joined a Mormon mission to Siam. He left his 21-month-old son with his sister, Hannah Maria Savage Eldridge, while he served a four-year mission in the Far East. He left for Siam on October 21, 1852, by traveling through Las Vegas, Nevada, to Los Angeles, California, and then by boat to San Francisco. On January 30, 1853, Savage left San Francisco headed for Siam. On the boat, Levi was struck with smallpox, but survived the outbreak. He arrived in Calcutta, India, on April 25, 1853, and then went on to Rangoon, Burma. He then went to Maulmain, Burma, situated 300 km southeast of Yangon and 70 km south of Thaton, at the mouth of Thanlwinwhere. There he attempted to preach at the British cantonment, but was prevented by the local British commander. Because Siam was experiencing a civil war, Savage never reached there. He served 2½ years in the Far East mission and started home for Utah on October 12, 1855. He traveled from Calcutta, India, to Boston, Massachusetts, by going around the Cape of Good Hope. He arrived in Boston February 28, 1856, and went on to Ohio and Michigan to visit family. In his journal Savage wrote on June 19, 1856, \"I have circled the globe.\" The entire journey took four years.\n\nSavage worked as a teacher on his return to Utah. Savage served with the Nauvoo Legion during the Utah War, and in 1858 he moved to Lehi, Utah, and worked as a supplier for the U.S. army at Camp Floyd. After seven years, he moved to Toquerville, Utah, where he lived the last 45 years of his life with his wife, two step-daughters/wives, and three children. \n\nOne of Savage's last journal entries was February 1903, \"This date shows that I have neglected to note daily occurrences in my journal for some time past; however, it is better late than never.\"\n\nSavage died on December 13, 1910, in Toquerville, Washington County, Utah, and is buried in the cemetery in Toquerville.\n\n\nSavage is the principal character (played by actor Jasen Wade) in the T. C. Christensen film \"17 Miracles\". This film is based on the actual events surrounding Savage's efforts to aid the Willie Handcart Company in their journey to Salt Lake City in 1856, emphasizing the miracles he and fellow travelers reported during the trek.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2027075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027075", "title": "Point State Park", "text": "Point State Park\n\nPoint State Park (locally known as The Point) is a Pennsylvania state park on in Downtown Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, USA, at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, forming the Ohio River.\n\nBuilt on land acquired via eminent domain from industrial enterprises in the 1950s, the park opened in August 1974 when construction was completed on its iconic fountain. Pittsburgh settled on the current design after rejecting an alternative plan for a Point Park Civic Center designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nThe park also includes the outlines and remains of two of the oldest structures in Pittsburgh, Fort Pitt and Fort Duquesne. The Fort Pitt Museum, housed in the Monongahela Bastion of Fort Pitt, commemorates the French and Indian War (1754–63), in which the area soon to become Pittsburgh was a major battlefield. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for its role in the strategic struggles between Native Americans, French colonists, and British colonists, for control of the Ohio River watershed.\n\nToday the park provides recreational space for workers, visitors, and residents in downtown Pittsburgh and also acts as the site for major cultural events in the city, including the Venture Outdoors Festival, Three Rivers Arts Festival and Three Rivers Regatta. The park is operated by the Pennsylvania Bureau of State Parks.\n\nThe location of the fountain at the tip of the Point previously served as a connector for two old bridges, the Manchester Bridge (over the Allegheny River) and Point Bridge (over the Monongahela). Both were removed in 1970 to make way for the fountain.\n\nIn April 2009, the fountain was turned off for a $9.6 million upgrade and refurbishment; it went online again at the opening of the Three Rivers Arts Festival on June 7, 2013.\n\nThe fountain also serves as the western terminus for the Great Allegheny Passage, a 150-mile hiker-biker trail beginning at the 184.5 milepost of the Cumberland, MD terminus of the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park, which begins in the Georgetown area of Washington, DC, thus forming in total a 350-mile recreational trail between DC and Pittsburgh.\n\nMichael DeBerardinis, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park on October 11, 2006. The plans called for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations, and updating outdated amenities and grew to a final figure of $36 million . The project was scheduled to be completed within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th anniversary celebration in 2008.\n\nSections of the park had fallen into disuse since it was established in the summer of 1974. The homeless had used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years. Graffiti on the structures of the park had become a major problem. Sections of the park were littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways were cracked and beginning to fall apart. The restoration project aimed to reestablish the park as a recreational destination.\n\nPlans for the 2006 improvements to the park included installing new pumps and pipes in the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the rest rooms, water taxi landings and surrounding docks, and installing wireless internet access hubs.\n\nThese plans were not put into place without some controversy. On January 25, 2007, 13 members of two local labor unions were arrested for blocking access by contractors to the work sites at the remnants of Fort Pitt. The unions were protesting the use of four nonrepresented workers by the contractor. In addition, advocates for historical preservation disagreed with the decision to bury the remnants of the fort's walls, which could damage the bricks and remove the walls from public access.\n\nPoint State Park was reopened to the public in the spring of 2008. The renovation process took a year and a half to complete.\n\nThe confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, creating the Ohio River, has greatly impacted the history of Point State Park. This confluence was referred to as the Forks of the Ohio, which remains the official landmark-designated name for the site. It was once at the center of river travel, trade, and even wars throughout the pioneer history of Western Pennsylvania. During the mid-18th century, the armies of France and the Great Britain carved paths through the wilderness to control the point area and trade on the rivers. The French built Fort Duquesne in 1754 on foundations of Fort Prince George, which had been built by the colonial forces of Virginia.\n\nThe French held Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War, and it became one of the focal points for that war because of its strategic riverside location in disputed territory. The French held the fort successfully early in the war, turning back the 1755 expedition led by General Edward Braddock. A smaller attack by James Grant in September 1758 was repulsed, but with heavy losses. Two months later, on November 25, the Forbes Expedition, under General John Forbes, captured the site after the French destroyed Fort Duquesne the day before. The British built a much larger fort on the site and named it Fort Pitt.\n\nThe Forbes Expedition was successful where the Braddock expedition had failed because of the Treaty of Easton, in which local American Indians agreed to abandon their alliance with the French. American Indians, primarily Delawares and Shawnee, made this agreement with the understanding that the British military would leave the area after the war. The Indians did not want British army garrisons in their territory. The British, however, built Fort Pitt on the site, naming it after William Pitt the Elder.\n\nAs a result, in 1763 local Delawares and Shawnees took part in Pontiac's Rebellion, an effort to drive the British from the region. The Indians' siege of Fort Pitt began on June 22, 1763, but the fort was too strong to be taken by force. During a diplomatic meeting at the fort, the commander of Fort Pitt gave Delaware Indian emissaries blankets that had been exposed to smallpox in hopes of infecting the surrounding tribes. A similar plan was approved by British General Jeffery Amherst and his subordinate Colonel Henry Bouquet, who was marching to Fort Pitt with a force of 460 soldiers. This attempt was successful and effectively killed between 400,000-500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans during and in the years after the war ended. On August 1, 1763, most of the Indians broke off the siege to intercept an approaching force under Colonel Bouquet, resulting in the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 20.\n\nAfter Pontiac's War, Fort Pitt was no longer necessary to the British Crown, and was abandoned to the locals in 1772. At that time, the Pittsburgh area was claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania, and a power struggle for the region commenced. Virginians took control of Fort Pitt, and for a brief while in the 1770s it was called Fort Dunmore, in honour of Virginia's Governor Lord Dunmore. The fort was a staging ground in Dunmore's War of 1774.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Fort Pitt was the headquarters for the western theatre of the war.\n\nA small brick building called the Blockhouse—actually an outbuilding known as a redoubt—remains in Point State Park, the only intact remnant of Fort Pitt. It was erected in 1764, and is believed to be the oldest building, not only in Pittsburgh, but in Western Pennsylvania. Used for many years as a house, the blockhouse was purchased and has been preserved for many years by the Daughters of the American Revolution, who open it to the public.\n\nDuring the city's early history, the Point became a hub for industry and transportation. By the 1930s it was occupied by warehouses and railroad yards. Wright commented in 1935 that the city had wasted the potential of its rivers and hilly landscape. In 1945, the situation in this regard was even worse; four years of World War II and eight years of the Great Depression had permitted urban blight to make substantial inroads. The total assessed property value in the Golden Triangle was at a record low and falling. At the point, rarely used railroad facilities included of yards (60000 m) and half a mile (800 m) of elevated train tracks.\n\nCity leaders wanted to alleviate traffic congestion in the city. The Manchester Bridge and Point Bridge met at the point in a way that left no room for the interchange required by the volume of traffic. The growth of the city had made parking a serious problem as well. Robert Moses, who had developed the traffic scheme for New York City, was brought in and published a traffic plan in 1939. He offered a circular park surrounded by approach roads connecting the bridges to the city. His plan retained the existing bridges, but most of the experts brought in to examine the problem called for the bridges to be relocated away from the Point, creating more space for adjoining access roads and interchanges.\n\nAlthough the site had substantial problems, Robert Alberts observes that \"the condition, in the view of the city planner, was almost perfect\". The Point had few property owners who needed to be bought out, few residents who would need relocation, and few structures worth preserving. Architects and planners could treat it as a tabula rasa.\n\nDuring the course of the Second World War, federal and local authorities established three goals for the site: \"the creation of a park commemorating the site's history, improved traffic circulation through the construction of new roads and bridges, and designation of a portion of the site for new office buildings, intended to stimulate private interest in the Golden Triangle\". The Allegheny Conference on Community Development became a driving force for these changes. Edgar Kaufmann, a Pittsburgh department store owner, sat on the board of the Conference and became chair of the 28-member committee convened to look into the Point Park problem.\n\nKaufmann wanted a plan for the Point that was more urban and developed than the park others were imagining. In particular, Kaufmann was a major supporter of Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera and wanted to provide it with a permanent building. He brought in Wright, by that time a preeminent architect, who had done numerous other projects for Kaufmann in the past, including Kaufmann's landmark home at Fallingwater and an unbuilt design for a parking garage.\n\nPlans for Point Park Civic Center fell through and ultimately, the site was turned into a park with historic and recreational aspects, Point State Park. The Fort Pitt blockhouse remained intact, and three of the five bastions of the fort have been restored. The state acquired almost all property for the site by 1949, at a cost of $7,588,500 ($  in 2020); the park was finally completed in August 1974. Areas adjoining the park were condemned to permit commercial development, most notably Gateway Center.\n\nMoving downstream about 100 yards:\nThe following state parks are within of Point State Park:\n\n"}

{"id": "2027082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027082", "title": "Romanization of Greek", "text": "Romanization of Greek\n\nRomanization of Greek is the transliteration (letter-mapping) or transcription (sound-mapping) of text from the Greek alphabet into the Latin alphabet. The conventions for writing and romanizing Ancient Greek and Modern Greek differ markedly, which can create confusion. The sound of the English letter B () was written as in ancient Greek but is now written as the digraph , while the modern sounds like the English letter V () instead. The Greek name became Johannes in Latin and then John in English, but in modern Greek has become ; this might be written as Yannis, Jani, Ioannis, Yiannis, or Giannis, but not Giannes or Giannēs as it would be for ancient Greek. The word might variously appear as Hagiοs, Agios, Aghios, or Ayios, or simply be translated as \"Holy\" or \"Saint\" in English forms of Greek placenames.\n\nTraditional English renderings of Greek names originated from Roman systems established in antiquity. The Roman alphabet itself was a form of the Cumaean alphabet derived from the Euboean script that valued as and as and used variant forms of and that became L and S. When this script was used to write the classical Greek alphabet, ⟨κ⟩ was replaced with ⟨c⟩, ⟨αι⟩ and ⟨οι⟩ became ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨œ⟩, and ⟨ει⟩ and ⟨ου⟩ were simplified to ⟨i⟩ (more rarely—corresponding to an earlier pronunciation—⟨e⟩) and ⟨u⟩. Aspirated consonants like ⟨θ⟩, ⟨φ⟩, initial-⟨ρ⟩, and ⟨χ⟩ simply wrote out the sound: ⟨th⟩, ⟨ph⟩, ⟨rh⟩, and ⟨ch⟩. Because English orthography has changed so much from the original Greek, modern scholarly transliteration now usually renders ⟨κ⟩ as ⟨k⟩ and the diphthongs ⟨αι, οι, ει, ου⟩ as ⟨ai, oi, ei, ou⟩. Modern scholars also increasingly render ⟨χ⟩ as ⟨kh⟩.\n\nThe sounds of Modern Greek have diverged from both those of Ancient Greek and their descendant letters in English and other languages. This led to a variety of romanizations for names and placenames in the 19th and 20th century. The Hellenic Organization for Standardization (ELOT) issued its system in cooperation with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1983. This system was adopted (with minor modifications) by the United Nations' Fifth Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names at Montreal in 1987, by the United Kingdom's Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use (PCGN) and by the United States' Board on Geographic Names (BGN) in 1996, and by the ISO itself in 1997. Romanization of names for official purposes (as with passports and identity cards) were required to use the ELOT system within Greece until 2011, when a legal decision permitted Greeks to use irregular forms (such as \"Demetrios\" for ) provided that official identification and documents also list the standard forms (as, for example, \"Demetrios OR Dimitrios\"). Other romanization systems still encountered are the BGN/PCGN's earlier 1962 system and the system employed by the American Library Association and the United States' Library of Congress.\n\n\"Greeklish\" has also spread within Greece itself, owing to the rapid spread of digital telephony from cultures using the Latin alphabet. Since Greek typefaces and fonts are not always supported or robust, Greek email and chatting has adopted a variety of formats for rendering Greek and Greek shorthand using Latin letters. Examples include \"8elo\" and \"thelw\" for , \"3ava\" for , and \"yuxi\" for .\n\nThe following tables list several romanization schemes from the Greek alphabet to modern English. For the romanization of Greek into other languages, see the corresponding articles in our sister wikis, such as \"\" on the . Note, however, that the ELOT, UN, and ISO formats for Modern Greek intend themselves as translingual and may be applied in any language using the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe American Library Association and Library of Congress romanization scheme employs its \"Ancient or Medieval Greek\" system for all works and authors up to the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, although Byzantine Greek was pronounced distinctly and some have considered \"Modern\" Greek to have begun as early as the 12th century.\n\nFor treatment of polytonic Greek letters—for example, —see also the section on romanizing Greek diacritical marks below.\n\nThe ISO, UN, and Greek, British, and American governments have all approved an essentially equivalent standard for \"transcription\" of Modern Greek into Latin letters; there remain minor differences in how they approach reversible \"transliteration\". The American Library Association and Library of Congress romanization scheme employs its \"Modern Greek\" system for all works and authors following the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nIn the table below, the special rules for vowel combinations () only apply when these letters function as digraphs. There are also words where the same letters stand side by side incidentally but represent separate vowels. In these cases each of the two letters is transcribed separately according to the normal rules for single letters. Such cases are marked in Greek orthography by either having an accent on the first rather than the second vowel letter, or by having a diaeresis over the second letter. For treatment of accents and diaereses—for example, —also see the section on romanizing Greek diacritical marks below.\n\nThe traditional polytonic orthography of Greek uses several distinct diacritical marks to render what was originally the pitch accent of Ancient Greek and the presence or absence of word-initial . In 1982, monotonic orthography was officially introduced for modern Greek. The only diacritics that remain are the acute accent (indicating stress) and the diaeresis (indicating that two consecutive vowels should not be combined).\n\nWhen a Greek diphthong is accented, the accent mark is placed over the \"second\" letter of the pair. This means that an accent over the \"first\" letter of the pair indicates vowels which should be taken (and romanized) separately. Although the second vowel is not marked with a superfluous diaeresis in Greek, the first-edition ELOT 743 and the UN systems place a diaeresis on the Latin vowel for the sake of clarity.\n\nApart from the diacritical marks native to Greek itself or used to romanize its characters, linguists also regularly mark vowel length with macrons () marking long vowels and rounded breves () marking short vowels. Where these are romanized, it is common to mark the long vowels with macrons over the Latin letters and to leave the short vowels unmarked; such macrons should not be confused or conflated with those used by some systems to mark eta and omega as distinct from epsilon, iota, and omicron.\n\nGreece's early Attic numerals were based on a small sample of letters (including heta) arranged in multiples of 5 and 10, likely forming the inspiration for the later Etruscan and Roman numerals.\n\nThis early system was replaced by Greek numerals which employed the entire alphabet, including the nonstandard letters digamma, stigma, or sigma-tau (placed between epsilon and zeta), koppa (placed between pi and rho), and sampi (placed after omega). As revised in 2001, ELOT 743 provides for the uncommon characters to be given (in Greek) as $ for stigma, + for koppa, and / for sampi. These symbols are not given lower-case equivalents. When used as numbers, the letters are used in combination with the upper \"keraia\" numeral sign ⟨ʹ⟩ to denote numbers from 1 to 900 and in combination with the lower \"keraia\" ⟨͵⟩ to denote multiples of 1000. (\"For a full table of the signs and their values, see\" Greek numerals.)\n\nThese values are traditionally romanized as Roman numerals, so that would be translated as Alexander III of Macedon and transliterated as \"Aléxandros III o Makedṓn\" rather than \"Aléxandros G\"' or \"Aléxandros 3\". Greek laws and other official documents of Greece which employ these numerals, however, are to be formally romanized using \"decimal\" Arabic numerals.\n\nAncient Greek text did not mark word division with spaces or interpuncts, instead running the words together (\"scripta continua\"). In the Hellenistic period, a variety of symbols arose for punctuation or editorial marking; such punctuation (or the lack thereof) are variously romanized, inserted, or ignored in different modern editions.\n\nModern Greek punctuation generally follows French with the notable exception of Greek's use of a separate question mark, the \"erotimatiko\", which is shaped like the Latinate semicolon. Greek punctuation which has been given formal romanizations include:\n\nThere are many archaic forms and local variants of the Greek alphabet. Beta, for example, might appear as round Β or pointed throughout Greece but is also found in the forms (at Gortyn), and (Thera), (Argos), (Melos), (Corinth), (Megara and Byzantium), and even (Cyclades). Well into the modern period, classical and medieval Greek was also set using a wide array of ligatures, symbols combining or abbreviating various sets of letters, such as those included in Claude Garamond's 16th-century \"grecs du roi\". For the most part, such variants—as and for π, for στ, and for —are just silently emended to their standard forms and transliterated accordingly. Letters with no equivalent in the classical Greek alphabet such as heta ( & ), meanwhile, usually take their nearest English equivalent (in this case, h) but are too uncommon to be listed in formal transliteration schemes.\n\nUncommon Greek letters which have been given formal romanizations include:\n\n\n"}

The album consists of a single track that runs for 74 minutes and 17 seconds.\n\nSeveral music genres and styles are covered over the course of the album, including easy listening, chanting, drone, noise and metal, generally being separated by ambience and sounds and voices in a surgical setting. There are no lyrics or song structures as such as one would traditionally expect; the band instead focuses on atmosphere and the creation of suspense through the use of eerie noises, wordless vocals, and sudden, jarring changes in volume and intensity. Approximately the last 20 minutes of the track consist of the sound of a turntable stylus stuck in the runout groove of a record. The track then ends abruptly, with the sound of someone counting in a fast tempo, followed immediately by the stylus sliding across a record's surface.\n\nThe booklet contains graphic photos of actual surgeries in which organs are seen being removed from human bodies from Max Aguilera's book \"The Sacred Heart: An Atlas of the Body Seen Through Invasive Surgery\".

Leschetizky's sister-in-law, Angele Potocka, referred to Horszowski as \"a wunderkind of high order\".\n\nIn 1901 he gave a performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 in Warsaw and soon after toured Europe and the Americas as a child prodigy. In 1905 the young Horszowski played for Gabriel Fauré and met Camille Saint-Saëns in Nice. In 1911 Horszowski put his performing career on hold in order to devote himself to literature, philosophy and art history in Paris.\n\nWhile Horszowski's family was of Jewish origin (which made him a fugitive from Europe in the 1930s), he was himself an early convert to Roman Catholicism, and was very devout. As the French critic André Tubeuf has written, \"Horszowski was both very Jewish and very Catholic, in both cases as only a Pole could have been.\"\n\nHorszowski, who was barely five feet tall, had rather small hands, reaching just over one octave; however, Allan Kozinn of \"The New York Times\" noted that \"he turned this limitation into an asset by focusing on music that was written on a more compact scale and made intellectual rather than physical demands\". Horszowski's performances were known for their natural, unforced quality, balancing intellect and emotion. He was frequently praised for his tonal quality, as was common for pupils of Leschetizky.\n\nHaving returned to the concert stage with the encouragement of Pablo Casals, he settled in Milan after the First World War, remaining there until he emigrated to the United States during World War II. Following the war, Horszowski frequently gave recitals with artists such as Casals, Alexander Schneider, Joseph Szigeti and the Budapest Quartet. He often appeared at the Prades Festival and the Marlboro Festival.\n\nFrom 1940 Horszowski lived in the United States, first in New York City and later in Philadelphia. He became an American citizen in 1948. Horszowski performed with the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Toscanini, with whom he was friends, in 1943 and 1953. During the 1954–1955 season, he gave a memorable cycle of Beethoven's entire solo piano works in New York. In 1960 he did the same for Mozart's piano sonatas. His very diverse and extensive repertoire also embraced such composers as Honegger, d'Indy, Martinů, Stravinsky, Szymanowski and Villa-Lobos. In 1979, the pianist recorded several works of Lodovico Giustini on a restored Cristofori pianoforte. These works had been commissioned by Cristofori and are the first known compositions written specifically for the pianoforte.\n\nHorszowski twice performed at the White House: with Casals and Schneider in 1961 for President Kennedy and a solo performance in 1979 for President Carter.\n\nHorszowski was widely recorded and can be heard on the HMV, Columbia, RCA, Vanguard, Nonesuch, and other labels. His final recordings for Nonesuch were made when he was in his mid to late nineties. He also taught at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where his pupils included Robert Dennison, Julius Eastman, Richard Goode, Dina Koston, Anton Kuerti, Murray Perahia, Peter Serkin, Steven De Groote, Kathryn Selby, Cecile Licad, and Leslie Spotz.\n\nIn 1981 the 89-year-old Horszowski married Bice Costa, an Italian pianist. Bice later edited Horszowski's memoirs and a volume of his mother's correspondence about Horszowski's early years. She also discovered and recorded some songs composed by Horszowski on French texts around 1913–1914.\n\nHorszowski's final performance took place in Philadelphia in October 1991. He died in that city a month before his 101st birthday. He gave his final lesson a week before his death.\n\n"}

He was an attacking left back who could also play in midfield. In a 17-year career, he scored 25 goals in 362 appearances in the Football League, and also won caps for the England under-21 and England B teams.\n\nGibson started his career at Aston Villa in 1978 and made around 200 appearances for the club in seven years, as well as winning the First Division title, the European Cup and the European Super Cup. He moved on to Manchester United in 1985, and during his five years at United he played 79 league games. He signed with Leicester City in 1990, after a short loan at Port Vale. After a four-year spell with the \"Foxes\" in which he helped the club to win promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in 1994, he transferred to Blackpool, before finishing his career by winning promotion out of the Third Division with Walsall in 1995.\n\nBorn in Bridport, Dorset, Gibson started his career as a youth team scholar at Aston Villa in July 1976, and turned professional after he played in the 1978 FA Youth Cup defeat to Crystal Palace. After making his debut against Bristol City on 18 November 1978, he broke into the first team in a Ron Saunders side narrowly missing out on European qualification in 1978–79 and 1979–80. He faced competition from Gary Williams, Mike Pejic, and Eamonn Deacy for the left-back spot. He went on to make 21 appearances in the 1980–81 season, as the \"Villans\" were crowned First Division champions. He then played at Wembley in the 1981 FA Charity Shield, as Villa shared the trophy after a 2–2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. In the 1981–82 campaign, he featured in both legs of the European Cup wins over Icelanders Valur and German side Berliner FC Dynamo, but remained on the bench for the 1982 European Cup Final victory over Bayern Munich at De Kuip. He took the trophy out on a night of drinking with Gordon Cowans and lost it, before it was returned to him the following day by police officers. He featured in both legs of Villa's 1982 European Super Cup victory over Barcelona, as Villa overturned a 1–0 defeat at the Camp Nou to claim an extra-time victory at Villa Park. Tony Barton's side went on to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup in 1982–83, where they were knocked out by a Juventus side fronted by Michel Platini. This was the end of the club's glory years, as they could only manage tenth place league finishes in 1983–84 and 1984–85.\n\nVilla manager Graham Turner allowed Gibson to be transferred to Manchester United in November 1985 for a £275,000 fee. He scored five goals in 22 games in the 1985–86 campaign, scoring his first United goal in a 1–0 New Year's Day victory over Birmingham City at Old Trafford. He also scored goals against Manchester City at home and Liverpool at Anfield, earning United a draw on both occasions. He played 26 games in the 1986–87 season, as an under-performing United side cost manager Ron Atkinson his job. Gibson made 33 starts in the 1987–88 season, as the \"Red Devils\" finished second in the league behind Liverpool. After the season ended he was rarely involved in first team games due to manager Alex Ferguson's decision to field Lee Martin as left-back, and was also beset with injury problems which kept him out of action for protracted periods of time. He played just three first team games in the entire 1988–89 season. By the end of the 1989–90 season he was fit and had appeared in the first FA Cup semi-final against Oldham Athletic.\n\nIn September 1990, he joined Second Division club Port Vale on loan, scoring on his debut at left back in a 3–2 defeat by Hull City at Boothferry Park on 29 September. He left Vale Park and returned to Manchester the next month after a further five games for John Rudge's \"Valiants\". He left United for David Pleat's Leicester City in December 1990 for £100,000. He did well at Filbert Street, helping the \"Foxes\" to avoid relegation from the Second Division in 1990–91 under caretaker-manager Gordon Lee. He then played his part in the revival under new manager Brian Little. City finished fourth in 1991–92, before losing 1–0 to Blackburn Rovers in the play-off Final. They again suffered heartbreak in 1992–93, reaching the play-off final again, only to lose 4–3 to Swindon Town (Gibson was an unused substitute). A third consecutive play-off final appearance came at the end of the 1993–94 campaign, and this time Leicester won promotion with a 2–1 victory over Derby County as Gibson played the game as a central midfielder. During his time at City he came the first substitute to be substituted, and the first substitute to be sent off.\n\nGibson never featured for Leicester in the Premier League however, and instead signed for Blackpool. He played just two Second Division games for Sam Allardyce's \"Seasiders\" at the start of the 1994–95 season, before departing Bloomfield Road for Third Division outfit Walsall. He played 33 league games to help Chris Nicholl's \"Saddlers\" to win promotion as the division's runners-up in 1994–95. He then departed the Bescot Stadium and retired from the Football League.\n\nGibson won one cap for the England under-21s on 8 September 1981, in a 0–0 draw with Norway. He also won one cap for the England B team on 13 November 1984, in a 2–0 win over New Zealand at the City Ground.\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2027114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027114", "title": "Frank McPherson", "text": "Frank McPherson\n\nFrancis Comber \"Frank\" McPherson (14 May 1901 – 5 March 1953) was an English footballer who played as a forward. Born in Barrow-in-Furness, he began his professional career with Partick Thistle in the Scottish Football League, before spending almost 20 years in The Football League with Chesterfield Municipal, Barrow, Manchester United, Watford and Reading.\n\nBorn in Barrow-in-Furness to parents from Aberdeen, McPherson worked as a ship plater for Vickers and played football for the works team, Barrow Shipbuilders. In April 1919, towards the end of the 1918–19 season, he signed as an amateur for Scottish club Partick Thistle, helping them to a fourth-place finish in the Scottish First Division.\n\nMcPherson returned to Barrow Shipbuilders at the end of the season, and played in their 1919–20 FA Cup Preliminary Round defeat to Kells White Star; however, in October 1919, he was signed by Midland League club Chesterfield Municipal, who – either ignoring his cup-tied status or unaware of it entirely – gave him his debut in their FA Cup second qualifying round match against South Normanton Colliery on 25 October; starting at centre-forward, he scored twice as Chesterfield won 5–0. After the match, South Normanton submitted an appeal to The Football Association that McPherson should not have been allowed to play, resulting in Chesterfield being disqualified from the competition and McPherson being banned for a month. Chesterfield manager Tom Callaghan protested that he was unaware that McPherson had already played in the FA Cup that season, but McPherson maintained that he had told his manager he was not available for selection. Callaghan offered McPherson £5 to retract that claim, as well as ordering club captain Peter Irvine to back him up; however, he was found out and sacked from his position, never for the football world to hear from him again.\n\nMcPherson returned to action in a league match against Mexborough Town on 29 November, scoring both Chesterfield goals in a 2–1 win. After two games out of the side, when regular half-back Arthur Lacey took over at centre-forward, McPherson returned for a 10-game spell at inside left, scoring five goals from that position. He was left out for the game away to Worksop Town, but returned for the next two games at home to Halifax Town and Worksop Town, before losing his position to Teddy Revill for the games against the Grimsby Town and Barnsley reserve teams. McPherson played out the season with seven consecutive matches at centre-forward, scoring four more goals to finish with 11 league goals in 20 appearances as Chesterfield won the Midland League.\n\nMcPherson lost his place in the Chesterfield first team to newly signed centre-forward Tom Smelt at the outset of the 1920–21 season, but Smelt only lasted one match in the position and McPherson was recalled. He played two games at centre-forward then one in each of the inside forward positions, including Chesterfield's 11–0 win over Dronfield Woodhouse in the FA Cup preliminary round on 25 September; however, he failed to score in those four games and did not feature again for another month, making a goalscoring return in a 3–2 defeat to Mexborough Town on 30 October. Despite the goal, he was dropped again for the FA Cup third qualifying round match against Staveley Town, before making his final two appearances for Chesterfield – first at centre-forward at home to Sheffield United Reserves, then at outside left at home to Nottingham Forest Reserves. With just one goal in six league appearances in 1920–21, McPherson finished his Chesterfield career with a total of 12 goals in 26 appearances.\n\nHaving not played for Chesterfield for more than two months, McPherson returned to Cumbria with Barrow in February 1921, and helped the team to win the Lancashire Combination title that season. At the end of the season, Barrow were elected as one of the founder members of the Football League Third Division North. In that inaugural season, Barrow finished in 15th place out of the 20 teams, and the following year was even worse, finishing 18th.\n\nMcPherson joined Manchester United in May 1923 for a fee of £500, making his first-team debut as an outside left in the first game of the 1923–24 season against Bristol City on 25 August. He played in all but eight games in his first season with Manchester United, including two appearances in the FA Cup, his two goals coming in consecutive matches – one against Bradford City in the league on 5 January 1924, and one against Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup on 12 January. All of his games that season were played at outside left, except the final two games of the season against The Wednesday, which he played at centre-forward.\n\nDespite that brief run-out at centre-forward, McPherson played exclusively at outside left in 1924–25, missing just four games. He was also a more prolific goalscorer, his seven goals in 38 league appearances helping the club to a second-place finish at the end of the season and promotion back to the First Division. He began the following season as the starting outside left, playing in the first seven games before the re-emergence of Harry Thomas cost him his place, starting with the game against Burnley on 26 September 1925. McPherson made a goalscoring return to the team as a centre-forward on 24 October, scoring twice in a 2–0 away win over Cardiff City; he retained the number 9 shirt for much of the rest of the season, before a three-game spell without scoring culminated in a 7–0 defeat away to Blackburn Rovers; Charlie Rennox, Jimmy Hanson and Chris Taylor shared centre-forward duties for the remaining six games of the season. Despite being dropped for the final six games, McPherson finished the season with a career-high 16 league goals, and a further four in the FA Cup, in which Manchester United reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by rivals Manchester City. McPherson's new-found scoring form was attributed to his pace, coupled with a change to the offside law, which now only required two defenders between the attacking player and the opposing goal line for the attacker to be onside.\n\nMcPherson's form continued into the 1926–27 season, which began with him scoring seven goals in the first four games. To accommodate Joe Spence's move to centre-forward, McPherson moved back to outside left for the game against Burnley on 18 September 1926, before being dropped entirely for the next two games against Cardiff City and Aston Villa. The next few games saw McPherson and Spence alternate as centre-forward, before McPherson reclaimed the position more permanently in mid-November, starting with a 3–2 win over Leicester City on 13 November in which he scored twice. He held onto the role for the next two months until the second replay of Manchester United's FA Cup third round tie against Reading on 17 January 1927, after which he spent four games back at outside left. The second half of the season saw a stark difference from the first half – after scoring 16 times in 26 appearances up to 22 January, McPherson failed to find the net for the rest of the season, and only appeared in nine of a potential 17 matches; he missed the game against Aston Villa on 19 February, before an unsettled run of four games in which he played twice at centre-forward and twice at inside left. He was dropped again for the game against The Wednesday on 26 March, and only appeared twice more in the final seven games of the season, against Leicester City on 2 April and against Derby County on 15 April.\n\nThe 1927–28 season began with McPherson back at outside left for four straight games, but despite scoring in the fourth against The Wednesday on 7 September, he was dropped for the next three games. He returned to the side for a 10-game spell starting with a 3–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on 24 September, scoring four goals in that time. After missing the game against Sheffield United on 10 December, he made a goalscoring return in a 4–1 win over Arsenal on 17 December. He was dropped again for the trip to Middlesbrough three games later on 31 December, before playing six games in a row from 7 January to 4 February, including three appearances at centre-forward in FA Cup games against Brentford and Bury. After missing four games, including cup ties against Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers, he was restored to the outside left position for four games in March 1928; he made one final appearance for Manchester United at outside left – a 4–3 defeat to Bury on 14 April 1928. Finishing the season with six goals in 26 league appearances, that brought McPherson's total for Manchester United to 45 goals in 159 appearances.\n\nAfter a brief stint with Lancashire Combination side Manchester Central at the start of the 1928–29 season, McPherson was signed by Watford for £850 in September 1928. He made his Watford debut at home to Fulham on 29 September, scoring both goals in a 6–2 defeat, before scoring a further three goals in the next two games. Despite his prodigious start in a Watford shirt, he missed their next match at home to Luton Town, but then went on an eight-game run in which he scored a further eight goals, including a hat-trick at home to Southend United. The next match – away to Northampton Town on 22 December – was the last one McPherson would miss all season, and after two further hat-tricks – away to Fulham on 9 February and at home to Walsall on 29 March – he finished the season with 33 goals in 33 league appearances, a club record that stood until Cliff Holton scored 42 goals in Watford's 1959–60 season, in which they achieved promotion from the Fourth Division.\n\nMcPherson was ever-present for the first 23 games of the 1929–30 season, and by 26 December, he had scored 22 of Watford's 29 total goals up to that point; Arthur Woodward (2) was the only other player to have scored more than once. The match against Torquay United on 28 December was McPherson's first absence of the season. He made eight more appearances after his return, scoring three goals, before he was sold to Reading in February 1930 for a fee of £1,500 and George James in part-exchange.\n\nAfter five seasons with Reading, McPherson returned to Watford in June 1933. He began the 1933–34 season with a run of six games in the team, scoring twice, but then made just one appearance in the next three months. He then had a short spell back in the team, playing three games towards the end of December, but it did not last and he only made one more appearance before the end of the season, in the penultimate game against Swindon Town on 28 April 1934; Watford won 4–0 with McPherson scoring twice.\n\nMcPherson began the 1934–35 season by playing in the first two games away to Bristol City and at home to Brighton & Hove Albion, but could not find the target and was not selected for the next 32 Watford matches. He made his comeback on 28 February, almost six months to the day after his last match, playing in Watford's Third Division South Cup third round replay against Queens Park Rangers. He then missed another month before returning for the Third Division South Cup semi-final against Coventry City on 28 March; although he did not score and the match finished 0–0, McPherson scored both Watford goals in the replay the following week to earn them a place in the final against Bristol Rovers, which Watford lost 3–2. These performances came as part of a seven-game run in the team, including four league games, in which McPherson scored once (in a 5–2 away defeat to Charlton Athletic). The league game against Exeter City on 19 April was his last appearance of the season.\n\nIt took McPherson until 12 October to make his first appearance of the 1935–36 season, a 5–2 defeat at home to Newport County, but although he scored, he did not appear again for three months. He made 15 more appearances that season, all consecutively between 15 January and 10 April, scoring nine goals, including three against Leicester City in the FA Cup; Leicester's eventual 4–3 victory meant that McPherson's hat-trick is believed to have made history as the first scored for a losing side in the FA Cup Proper. McPherson's final appearance for Watford was a 2–1 home defeat to Notts County on 10 April. He was released by Watford at the end of the season and returned to Barrow-in-Furness, where he worked again in the shipyards. In March 1937, he re-signed for Barrow, where he saw out his career with a final two goals in three appearances.\n\nAfter his retirement from football, McPherson became the licensee of the Greaves Arms Hotel in Oldham, a position he held until his sudden death in Davyhulme on 5 March 1953.\n\n"}

The song is featured on the duo's second compilation album \"Rock 'n Soul Part 1\" (1983). It was one of two new tracks that were recorded specifically for the compilation release and hit number eight on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. This song was featured in the 2013 video game \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n\nThe song centers on the plight of a teenage girl in high school. Her girlfriends only \"care about what she wears\" and the narrator assures her \"there's life after high school.\" The lyrics suggest she is wiser than her years and, in fact, is receiving an education to the behavior of adults in high school.\n\nThe music video to \"Adult Education\", directed by Tim Pope, takes place in what appears to be a torchlit stone temple or tomb. As Hall & Oates and their band sing, dance and play with modified instruments and ceremonial objects, a middle-aged man in a baseball cap organizes and wields several idols, while chanting. A teenage boy wearing a loincloth and a teenage girl draped in a white sheet cross a platform illuminated with modern lights and ascend a staircase to meet the man, who appears to bless them with an animal idol. The girl removes the sheet from her head and part of her body and the ritual continues. Eventually, both teenagers are placed on stone slabs; the boy acts terrified and appears to be restrained, while the girl lies motionless, her body draped in the white sheet. The video ends with the boy standing behind the idols' altar and the girl sitting on the stone slab in front of it, as Hall & Oates and their band continue to sing, dance and play instruments in the background. The final shots of the video are of hieroglyphs and ceremonial items scattered around the structure.\n\nHall later criticized the video in the book \"\". \"Videos began to attract wannabe Cecil B. DeMilles, directors who had almost unlimited budgets and did whatever they felt like. 'Adult Education' is a perfect example. We brought in a director I didn't know [Pope], who was newly hot. He didn't have a clue what to do with the song. The plot? I couldn't tell you.\" On VH1's Behind the Music retrospective of Hall & Oates' career, Oates also derided many of their old videos, describing this clip as \"\"Survivor\" on acid\".\n\n"}

Prior to Shamrock Rovers, O'Brien has played for clubs such as Bolton Wanderers, West Ham United and Sheffield Wednesday. He has also been called up by Ireland for international matches. In the year 2016, O'Brien was among thirteen people to be named as a victim of fraud and he testified in court for the trial.\n\nO'Brien started his career with Bolton Wanderers in 2004 after starting out his first year scholarships in 2002.\n\nTo gain further experience, O'Brien was loaned out to League One team Sheffield Wednesday for the most part of the 2004–05 season, making 15 appearances and scoring two goals, including one on his debut. After extending his loan spell at the club twice times, O'Brien was named as captain for the last game of his loan spell in honour of his contribution.\n\nUpon returning to Bolton Wanderers from a loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, O'Brien made his Premier League debut on 15 May 2005 against Everton when coming on as a late substitute in place of Fernando Hierro. He was given his first start in Bolton's colours in their away UEFA Cup 1st Round tie with PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv in September 2005. In the 2005–06 season, O'Brien was called up by the first team following a defensive crisis of injuries and that moment on, he became a first team regular, making thirty-three appearance in all competition. Initially playing as a centre-midfielder, O'Brien changed to a right-back role and made an impression, leading to Manager Sam Allardyce described him as a \"dominant force at right back in the Premiership\".\n\nO'Brien missed most of the 2006–07 season due to a knee injury. By October, O'Brien was expected to return from a pitch in a months time, with a help from an American doctor Dr Frank Jarrell, a pioneer in the field of spinal reflex analysis. However, his recovery was delayed for another 3–4 months, causing him to miss the rest of the season. Having regained his fitness, it wasn't until on 23 September 2007 when he made his return for Bolton, making his first start and playing the whole game, in a 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur. Since making his return from injury, he played most of the 2007–08 season in his natural midfield role as opposed to the right back position which he had been in two years previous. Despite further injury concerns, O'Brien went on to make 26 appearance in all competition.\n\nIn July 2008 he was given the number 8 shirt previously worn by Iván Campo and started well when he provided two assists against Stoke City and Arsenal. However, injuries restricted his appearances throughout the 2008–09 season. O'Brien finished the season, making eight appearance in all competitions.\n\nIn the 2009-10 season, O'Brien appeared as an unused substitute three times to the first ten league matches to the season. However, he suffered a knee injury that required an operation for the second time in twelve months and made no appearance this season. Despite this, he signed a one-year extension to his contract keeping him at Bolton Wanderers until the summer of 2011. After making a recovery, O'Brien made his return in a pre-season friendly match against Charleston Battery and after the match, O'Brien stated when he returned to the first team, he determined to make up the lost time. However, this never happened and it has been reported that O'Brien may need to be loaned out to gain first team football.\n\nOn 24 March 2011, O'Brien joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan for a second time until the end of the season, and made his debut two days later in a 1–1 draw at Dagenham & Redbridge. After making four appearance for the club, O'Brien made four appearance for the club on his second return. At the end of the season, he was released by Bolton Wanderers, ending his six years association with the club.\n\nIn July 2011, O'Brien was handed a trial by West Ham United. He featured in pre-season friendlies against BSC Young Boys and Basel before being signed on 30 July on a free transfer, after penning a two-year contract.\n\nHe made his competitive debut on 7 August 2011 in 1–0 home defeat to Cardiff City and scored his first goal for West Ham in a 4–0 away win against Watford on 16 August 2011; his first goal since January 2005. O'Brien was sent off, for the first time in his career, in the away match against Reading on 10 December 2011. Despite suffering from injuries during the season, O'Brien, nevertheless, went on to make thirty-three appearance in all competition and the club was promoted back to the Premier League.\n\nIn the 2012-13 season, O'Brien started well in the left-back position at the start of the season until he suffered a hamstring injury. O'Brien set up the only goal for Kevin Nolan in the game two weeks after making his return, in a 1-0 win over Newcastle United, which was followed by scoring his first-ever Premier League goal on 19 November 2012, which also earned his team a point against Stoke. He then scored the winning goal in the New Year's Day fixture against Norwich City. However, O'Brien suffered a hamstring injury and while on the sidelined, O'Brien signed a new contract with West Ham United on 13 January 2013, keeping him until 2013. Soon after signing a contract, O'Brien made his first appearance since returning from injury on 19 January 2013, in a 1-1 draw against Queens Park Rangers. O'Brien went on to finish the 2012-13 season, making thirty-four appearance in all competitions.\n\nIn the 2013-14 season, O'Brien's appearance was restricted to seventeen appearance, due to substitute bench and injuries. After missing out two matches between 11 January 2014 and 18 January 2014, due to injury, O'Brien made his return on 29 January 2014, making his first start and played the whole game, in a 0-0 draw against Chelsea. However, despite playing 90 minutes, O'Brien suffered a dislocated shoulder after he \"\"fell awkwardly following an off-the-ball push from Chelsea defender Gary Cahill\"\" and was sidelined for three months. Although he returned from an injury in late-April, O'Brien made his return in the last game of the season, playing as a right-back, in a 2-0 loss against Manchester City.\n\nIn the 2014-15 season, O'Brien appeared in the first three matches to the start of the season until he suffered a knee injury during an international break. After making his return from injury as an unused substitute against Burnley on 18 October 2014, O'Brien struggled to regain back his first team place and spent most of the season on the substitute bench, due to good performance from Carl Jenkinson.\n\nAhead of the 2015-16 season, O'Brien was expected to fight for his first team place under the new management of Slaven Bilić following the departure of Allardyce. Though he appeared five times in the Europa League matches for West Ham United campaign, O'Brien, however, suffered a calf injury at the start of the season. After returning from injury in late-October, it wasn't until on 30 January 2016, O'Brien made his first appearance in the fourth round of the FA Cup, in a 0–0 against Liverpool. O'Brien then made another appearance in the fourth round of the FA Cup replay against Liverpool, which saw West Ham United win 2-1. However, following a game with a win over Liverpool, O'Brien, once again, suffered a hamstring injury that kept him for weeks and even after making his return, O'Brien never made an appearance throughout the 2015-16 season.\n\nHe was released by West Ham at the end of his contract in June 2016.\n\nIn August 2017, he was back in Bolton, training with Bolton Wanderers fitness coach Nick Allamby in order to keep fit.\n\nOn 27 January 2018, O'Brien signed for League of Ireland team and boyhood club Shamrock Rovers after spending 18 months without a club.\n\nIn 2003, O'Brien was called by Republic of Ireland U17 and was involved in the tournament, resulting being awarded Player of the Tournament, due to his performance. Two years later, O'Brien was called up by Republic of Ireland U21 and appeared in the squad six times. Later in the year, he won FAI Under 19 International Player of the Year.\n\nIn February 2006, O'Brien was called up to the Republic of Ireland squad for the first time and made his debut for his country on 1 March 2006, against Sweden during Steve Staunton's first game in charge. Following a new appointment of Giovanni Trapattoni, O'Brien expressed frustration of being omitted by him that he was considered early retirement from international football.\n\nOn 3 August 2012, O'Brien was called up to the Republic of Ireland squad for 15 August friendly against Serbia, as a replacement for the injured Sean St Ledger. This was O'Brien's first call up in over four years, after overcoming a succession of long-term injuries.\n\nIn May 2014, O'Brien married Joanne Martin, an Irish model, at St Augustin's Church on Thomas in Wicklow.\n\nIn February 2016, O'Brien was among thirteen people to be named as a victim of fraud, committed by Stephen Ackerman. A month after leaving West Ham United, O'Brien testified in court in Ackerman's trial.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on the western side of the Naqsh-e Jahan Square, opposite to Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, and had been originally designed as a vast portal entrance to the grand palace which stretched from the Naqsh-e Jahan Square to the Chahar Baq Boulevard. The palace served as the official residence of Persian Emperors of the Safavid dynasty. UNESCO inscribed the Palace and the Square as a World Heritage site due to its cultural and historical importance. The palace is forty-eight meters high and there are six floors, each accessible by a difficult spiral staircase. In the sixth floor, Music Hall, deep circular niches are found in the walls, having not only aesthetic value, but also acoustic. Ālī Qāpū is regarded as the best example of Safavid architecture and a symbol of Iran's Islamic heritage.\nThe name Ali Qapu, from Persian \"‘Ālī\" (meaning \"imperial\" or \"great\"), and Azerbaijani \"Qāpū\" (meaning \"gate\"), was given to this place as it was right at the entrance to the Safavid palaces which stretched from the Naqsh-e Jahan Square to the Chahar Baq Boulevard.\nThe building, another wonderful Safavid edifice, was built by decree of Shah Abbas I in the early seventeenth century. It was here that the great monarch used to entertain noble visitors, and foreign ambassadors.\nShah Abbas, here for the first time, celebrated the Nowruz (Iranian New Year) of 1006 AH / 1597 C.E.\n\nAli Qapu is rich in naturalistic wall paintings by Reza Abbasi, the court painter of Shah Abbas I, and his pupils. There are floral, animal, and bird motifs in his works. The highly ornamented doors and windows of the palace have almost all been pillaged at times of social anarchy. Only one window on the third floor has escaped the ravages of time. Ali Qapu was repaired and restored substantially during the reign of Shah Sultan Hussein, the last Safavid ruler, but fell into a dreadful state of dilapidation again during the short reign of invading Afghans. Under the reign of Naser ad-Din Shah the Qajar (1848–96), the Safavid cornices and floral tiles above the portal were replaced by tiles bearing inscriptions.\n\nShah Abbas II was enthusiastic about the embellishment and perfection of Ali Qapu. His chief contribution was given to the magnificent hall, the constructors on the third floor. The 18 columns of the hall are covered with mirrors and its ceiling is decorated with great paintings.\n\nThe chancellery was stationed on the first floor. On the sixth, the royal reception and banquets were held. The largest rooms are found on this floor. The stucco decoration of the banquet hall abounds in motif of various vessels and cups. The sixth floor was popularly called the Music Hall. Here various ensembles performed music and sang songs.\n\nFrom the upper galleries, the Safavid ruler watched Chowgan (polo), army maneuvers and horse-racing in the Naqsh-e Jahan square.\n\nThe palace is depicted on the reverse of the Iranian 20,000 rials banknote. Actually, the palace is depicted on the reverse of the Iranian 20 rials banknote series 1953.\n\nThe Ali Qapu has multiple connotations, but generally connotes entrance or supreme gate to the complex of palaces and public buildings of the Safavi Government.\n\nAli Qapu's building was founded in several stages, beginning from a building with a single gate, with entrance to the government building complex, and gradually developed, ending in the existing shape. The period of the development, with intervals, lasted approximately seventy years.\n\nFirst Stage:\nThe initial building acting as entrance to the complex was in cubical shape and in two stories, with dimensions measuring 20 x 19 meter and 13 meter high.\n\nSecond Stage:\nFoundation of the upper hall, built on the entrance vestibule, with cubical shape, over the initial cubic shape structure with the same height in two visible stories.\n\nThird Stage:\nFoundation of the fifth story, the Music Amphitheater or the Music Hall, built on the lower hall, using the central room for sky light, and thus the vertical extension being emphasized.\n\nFourth Stage:\nFoundation of the eastern verandah or pavilion advancing towards the square, supported by the tower shaped building. By foundation of this verandah, the entrance vestibule was extended along the main gate and passage to the market, perpendicular to the eastern flank of the building.\n\nFifth Stage:\nFoundation of the wooden ceiling of the balcony, supported by 18 wooden columns, and contemporaneous with erection of the ceiling, an additional stairway of the southern flank was founded and was called the Kingly Stairway.\n\nSixth Stage:\nDuring this stage, a water tower was built in the northern flank for provision of water for the copper pool of the columned balcony. Plaster decorations in reception story and the Music Hall.\n\nThe room on the sixth floor is also decorated with plaster-work, representing pots and vessels and one is famous as the music and sound room. It is certainly well worth visiting for the cut out decorations round the room, which represent a considerable artistic feat. These cut out shapes were not placed there to act as cupboards; the stucco-work is most delicate and falls to pieces at the highest touch. So we conclude that it was placed in position in these rooms for ornament and decoration. The rooms were used for private parties and for the king's musicians, and these hollow places in the walls retained the echoes and produced the sounds of the singing and musical instruments clearly in all parts.\n\nThe decoration of the large room on the third floor which opens out on the large pillared hall, and which was used by Shah Abbas for entertaining his official guests, is the most interesting. Fortunately, the ceilings, on which birds are depicted in their natural colors, have remained without interference in their original state from Safavid times, and these are the best roofs in the building.\n\n\n\n"}

It was intended to divert traffic from the 17th century Berwick Bridge, and until the 1980s it formed part of the A1 road, the main route from London to Edinburgh. However, the construction of the A1 River Tweed Bridge to the west of Berwick has since reduced the Royal Tweed Bridge's importance.\n\nIt was designed by L.G. Mouchel & Partners, with consulting engineers Charles Bressey and J. H. Bean, and the contractors for construction were Holloway Brothers of London.\n\nConstruction took place between 1925 and 1928. The total cost of the bridge was £180,000, and up to 170 workers were employed during its construction. It was opened by the then Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, on 16 May 1928. \n\nIt was built to supplement the older Berwick Bridge a short distance downstream, which still carries road traffic. A bridge had first been proposed in 1896, and a scheme was produced in 1914, but the outbreak of the First World War meant that plans were put on hold until 1924. A seven-arched stone bridge was proposed at this time, but eventually the concrete design was decided upon.\n\nThe bridge was repaired in 1980, as it had been damaged by de-icing salt and its proximity to the sea. The A1 River Tweed Bridge, which opened in 1984, now carries the A1 road about a mile to the west of the Royal Tweed Bridge, reducing its importance as a crossing of the Tweed.\n\nIt is a Grade II* listed building in recognition of its innovative design and striking scale.\n\nThe bridge is built from reinforced concrete and consists of four unequal arches, with approach viaducts at each end. The northern end of the bridge is higher, and towards that end the spans are longer.\n\nThe spans are of lengths , , and , and the approach viaducts are and long. The spans consist of four arched ribs, solid in the case of the shortest span and hollow for the longer spans. Columns rise from the ribs and are connected at the top by longitudinal beams, which support perpendicular beams that carry the roadway. The piers and abutments are constructed from mass concrete, and there are expansion joints and a system of wind braces over each of the piers.\n\nThe parapets are made of dressed sandstone, and there are cast iron lamposts on either side of the roadway.\n\nAt the time of its construction, it held the record for the longest single concrete span in the UK.\n\n"}

{"id": "2027148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027148", "title": "Substrate-level phosphorylation", "text": "Substrate-level phosphorylation\n\nSubstrate-level phosphorylation is a metabolic reaction that results in the formation of ATP or GTP by conversion of a higher energy substrate (whether phosphate group attached or not) into lower energy product and a using some of the released chemical energy, the Gibbs free energy, to transfer a phosphoryl (PO) group to ADP or GDP from another phosphorylated compound.\n\nUnlike oxidative phosphorylation, oxidation and phosphorylation are not coupled in the process of substrate-level phosphorylation, and reactive intermediates are most often gained in the course of oxidation processes in catabolism. Most ATP is generated by oxidative phosphorylation in aerobic or anaerobic respiration while substrate-level phosphorylation provides a quicker, less efficient source of ATP, independent of external electron acceptors. This is the case in human erythrocytes, which have no mitochondria, and in oxygen-depleted muscle.\n\nAdenosine triphosphate is a major \"energy currency\" of the cell. The high energy bonds between the phosphate groups can be broken the power a variety of reactions used in all aspects of cell function.\n\nSubstrate-level phosphorylation occurs in the cytoplasm of cells during glycolysis and in mitochondria either during the Krebs cycle or by MTHFD1L (EC 6.3.4.3), an enzyme interconverting ADP + phosphate + 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to ATP + formate + tetrahydrofolate (reversibly), under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In the pay-off phase of glycolysis, a net of 2 ATP are produced by substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\nThe first substrate-level phosphorylation occurs after the conversion of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde and Pi and NAD+ to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate via glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is then dephosphorylated via phosphoglycerate kinase, producing 3-phosphoglycerate and ATP through a substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\nThe second substrate-level phosphorylation occurs by dephosphorylating phosphoenolpyruvate, catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, producing pyruvate and ATP.\n\nDuring the preparatory phase, each 6-carbon glucose molecule is broken into two 3-carbon molecules. Thus, in glycolysis dephosphorylation results in the production of 4 ATP. However, the prior preparatory phase consumes 2 ATP, so the net yield in glycolysis is 2 ATP. 2 molecules of NADH are also produced and can be used in oxidative phosphorylation to generate more ATP.\n\nATP can be generated by substrate-level phosphorylation in mitochondria in a pathway that is independent from the proton motive force. In the matrix there are three reactions capable of substrate-level phosphorylation, utilizing either phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or succinate-CoA ligase, or monofunctional C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase.\n\nMitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is thought to participate in the transfer of the phosphorylation potential from the matrix to the cytosol and vice versa. However, it is strongly favored towards GTP hydrolysis, thus it is not really considered as an important source of intra-mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\nSuccinate-CoA ligase is a heterodimer composed of an invariant α-subunit and a substrate-specific ß-subunit, encoded by either SUCLA2 or SUCLG2. This combination results in either an ADP-forming succinate-CoA ligase (A-SUCL, EC 6.2.1.5) or a GDP-forming succinate-CoA ligase (G-SUCL, EC 6.2.1.4). The ADP-forming succinate-CoA ligase is potentially the only matrix enzyme generating ATP in the absence of a proton motive force, capable of maintaining matrix ATP levels under energy-limited conditions, such as transient hypoxia.\n\nThis enzyme is encoded by MTHFD1L and reversibly interconverts ADP + phosphate + 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to ATP + formate + tetrahydrofolate.\n\nIn working skeletal muscles and the brain, Phosphocreatine is stored as a readily available high-energy phosphate supply, and the enzyme creatine phosphokinase transfers a phosphate from phosphocreatine to ADP to produce ATP. Then the ATP releases giving chemical energy. This is sometimes erroneously considered to be substrate-level phosphorylation, although it is a transphosphorylation.\n\nDuring anoxia, provision of ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation in the matrix is important not only as a mere means of energy, but also to prevent mitochondria from straining glycolytic ATP reserves by maintaining the adenine nucleotide translocator in ‘forward mode’ carrying ATP towards the cytosol.\n\nAn alternative method used to create ATP is through oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place during cellular respiration. This process utilizes the oxidation of NADH to NAD, yielding 3 ATP, and of FADH to FAD, yielding 2 ATP. The potential energy stored as an electrochemical gradient of protons (H) across the inner mitochondrial membrane is required to generate ATP from ADP and P (inorganic phosphate molecule), a key difference from substrate-level phosphorylation. This gradient is exploited by ATP synthase acting as a pore, allowing H from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to move down its electrochemical gradient into the matrix and coupling the release of free energy to ATP synthesis. Conversely, electron transfer provides the energy required to actively pump H out of the matrix.\n"}

{"id": "2027160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027160", "title": "Graham Bonnet", "text": "Graham Bonnet\n\nGraham Bonnet (born 23 December 1947) is an English rock singer and songwriter. He has recorded and performed as a solo artist and as a member of several hard rock and heavy metal bands including Rainbow, the Michael Schenker Group, Alcatrazz, and Impellitteri. Bonnet's style is described as being a cross between Don Johnson in \"Miami Vice\" and James Dean. He is also known for his powerful singing voice but is capable of also singing soft melodies. His singing has been noted as 'very loud' by both his contemporaries and himself, and he claims to be a self-taught singer with 'no discipline for lessons'.\n\nBonnet was born in Skegness, England in 1947. He had his first hit single with the duo, the Marbles in 1968, with the single \"Only One Woman\" (Polydor 56 272), which reached Number 5 in the UK Singles Chart. This and its follow-up, “The Walls Fell Down,” were both written by Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees who had recorded in Australia with Bonnet's bandmate from the Marbles, Trevor Gordon.\n\nBonnet then quit to do advert jingles. He appeared in the 1974 British comedy film, \"Three for All\" as lead singer of 'Billy Beethoven', a fictional band, along with several notable UK comedy personalities and his then partner Adrienne Posta, although his character's lines were limited to only two words.\n\nIn 1977, he released an eponymous album, which was certified gold in Australia. The single, \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", a cover version of the Bob Dylan song, also reached Number 3 in Australia in November 1977, and the following year the single \"Warm Ride\", written by the Bee Gees, a leftover from the \"Saturday Night Fever\" sessions, reached number two there in August.\n\nIn 1979, Bonnet was approached to join UK glam rock band Sweet to replace Brian Connolly. However, he was chosen by Ritchie Blackmore to replace Ronnie James Dio as the vocalist of hard rock band Rainbow. This was something of a musical departure for Bonnet, who had previously identified himself more as an R&B singer. Bonnet would later credit his time in Rainbow and his collaboration with Blackmore, in particular, as fundamentally changing his musical outlook to a more hard rock focus. He sang on the \"Down to Earth\" LP, which would become his most successful album. It spawned two hit singles in 1979 and 1980: \"Since You Been Gone\" and \"All Night Long\". During Bonnet's time in the band, Rainbow also headlined the inaugural Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, Castle Donington.\n\nBonnet's time with Rainbow was short and he left to resume his solo career, releasing the \"Line-Up\" album in 1981, handled by producer John Eden. Following on from his time in Rainbow, the album had a markedly more rock-based sound than his previous solo recordings, whilst retaining some of his former R&B influences. For the recording of \"Line Up\" Bonnet enlisted several well-known rock musicians including Whitesnake guitarist Mick Moody, Whitesnake and Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell, Deep Purple and Whitesnake keyboard player Jon Lord, and Status Quo guitarists Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt. The album reached No. 62 in the UK Albums Chart. The album's lead single, \"Night Games\", reached No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart, with the follow-up single, \"Liar\", reaching No. 51. Around this time Bonnet sang on an advertisement for Levi's jeans (the song was entitled \"These Eyes\"), although his version has never been released.\n\nTempted by an offer from ex-UFO guitarist Michael Schenker, Bonnet continued his progression to a heavier musical style and joined the Michael Schenker Group (MSG) for the \"Assault Attack\" album. However, he was fired from the group after a single concert, at Sheffield Polytechnic (now called Sheffield Hallam University), when he drunkenly exposed himself on stage.\n\nUpon leaving MSG, Bonnet decided to form his own band, drawing inspiration from his days in Rainbow. In 1983, he co-founded Alcatrazz, with Gary Shea (bass), and Jimmy Waldo (keyboards) of the band New England, former Alice Cooper drummer Jan Uvena, and Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen. The band's debut album, \"No Parole from Rock N' Roll\", featured a distinctly heavy metal sound, with Bonnet describing the material as the heaviest that he had recorded to date. The band enjoyed moderate success in the United States, and major success in Japan.\n\nThe band released three studio albums (\"No Parole from Rock N' Roll\", \"Disturbing the Peace\", with guitarist Steve Vai replacing Malmsteen, and \"Dangerous Games\" with Danny Johnson on guitar). Alcatrazz also released a live album, \"Live Sentence\", with material from Yngwie Malmsteen's period in the band. For the \"Dangerous Games\" LP, Alcatrazz recorded a remake of Bonnet's hit song \"Only One Woman\" from his first band The Marbles. In 1987, Alcatrazz appeared on the second series of the BBC TV programme \"Rock School\", with Bonnet providing singing tips. The programme also included clips of Alcatrazz in rehearsal. Later that year, Alcatrazz disbanded, and Bonnet returned to his solo career. In 2009, Bonnet reformed Alcatrazz with three new musicians. Bonnet did not consult with his former bandmates Uvena and Waldo about re-forming the original line-up, and in response they also re-grouped as a separate version of Alcatrazz. Both bands have maintained official pages on MySpace.com.\n\nBonnet later reformed his version of the band as \"Alcatrazz featuring Graham Bonnet\" with guitarist Howie Simon (Jeff Scott Soto Band, Talisman), drummer Glen Sobel (Impellitteri, Beautiful Creatures, Tony MacAlpine), and bassist Tim Luce and toured Japan in May and June 2007—sharing the headline with another ex-Rainbow vocalist, Joe Lynn Turner. Howie Simon revealed in a 2010 interview that it was his suggestion to bring back the Alcatrazz name. They also headlined the BerkRock festival in Berkovitsa, Bulgaria in July 2008 and have played various West Coast US dates including support slots for Y&T. Alcatrazz continued to perform live occasionally until 2014.\n\nIn March 2017, three-fifths of the original lineup (Bonnet, Waldo and Shea) reunited for three shows in Japan, which also included Conrado Pesinato and Mark Benquechea on guitar and drums respectively. The performances were recorded for the live album/DVD \"Parole Denied - Tokyo 2017\", which was released on 7 December 2018.\n\nIn February 2019, Bonnet confirmed that he had once again resurrected Alcatrazz, with a new lineup featuring himself, Waldo, Benquechea, Beth-Ami Heavenstone, as well as new guitarist Joe Stump. Heavenstone thus briefly became Alcatrazz's first female member, having played bass in The Graham Bonnet Band, where she was Waldo's bandmate. This lineup planned to record a new album together, which will also include contributions from Chris Impellitteri, Bob Kulick, Dario Mollo and former Alcatrazz guitarist Steve Vai. Shea returned to Alcatrazz in January 2020 to replace Heavenstone.\n\nBonnet's post-Alcatrazz projects have all been short-lived and included Blackthorne (working with ex-Balance guitarist Bob Kulick, brother of Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick), backing vocals for the Danish heavy metal band Pretty Maids' \"Future World\" and numerous session work for Forcefield, appearing on \"To Oz and Back\" and \"Let The Wild Run Free\". In 1988, Bonnet joined Impellitteri, for their album \"Stand in Line\".\n\nAn appearance on Eddie Hardin and Pete York's musical adaptation of \"Wind in The Willows\", performed live in Germany in 1991, saw Bonnet sing on around six of the songs alongside fellow musicians Jon Lord, Don Airey and Ray Fenwick amongst others. Fenwick and Airey also featured heavily on Bonnet's 1991 solo album \"Here Comes The Night\" which includes several covers as well as songs credited to his then wife Jo Eime, and another remake of the Marbles' \"Only One Woman\".\n\nIn 1997, he released \"Underground\", a new solo album, which helped re-establish him with his fan base in Japan. 1999's \"The Day I Went Mad\" featured guitarist Slash, Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell, Bruce Kulick plus guitarist, Mario Parga.\n\nBonnet contributed lead vocals to the Japanese heavy metal band Anthem's 2000 release \"Heavy Metal Anthem\", which had reworks of classic Anthem tracks. Bonnet rejoined Impellitteri in 2000 for their \"System X\" album. Meanwhile, his 1999 Japanese solo album got a UK release in September 2001.\n\nAt the back end of 2001, Bonnet went on a solo UK tour. His band included keyboard player Don Airey, bassist Chris Childs and drummer Harry James of Thunder and guitarist Dario Mollo.\n\nIn early 2004, Bonnet joined Italian guitarist Dario Mollo's new project Elektric Zoo, touring Europe during April. Maintaining the Italian connection, the singer also participated in Matteo Filippini's project, Moonstone, featuring on the track \"Not Dead Yet\".\n\nIn 2006, Bonnet contributed vocals to the \"Welcome to America\" album by Taz Taylor Band. The band toured the UK in 2007 and Europe in 2008.\n\nHe also appeared in the \"Countdown Spectacular\" concert series in Australia between August and September 2007. He sang two songs, \"Warm Ride\" and \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\".\n\nA press release dated 6 November 2008 reported that Bonnet would be contributing vocals for a highlights CD with the metal opera project, Lyraka. The album \"Lyraka Volume 1\" was released on 2 November 2010. It was announced on 17 November 2010, that Bonnet would also be featured on \"Lyraka Volume 2\".\n\nBonnet currently resides in Los Angeles, California, from where he continues to record and tour extensively. Bonnet toured the UK with Rainbow tribute band Catch the Rainbow starting in March 2014.\n\nHe collaborated in the Stardust Reverie Project, a supergroup featuring Zak Stevens and Lynn Meredith among others. Their first album \"Ancient Rites of the Moon\" was released in April 2014. He contributed on vocals in one track of the second Stardust Reverie album \"Proclamation of Shadows\", which came out in March 2015.\n\nIn 2015, Bonnet formed The Graham Bonnet Band, and toured the UK and Europe, playing songs from throughout his career including Alcatrazz and Rainbow. The band released a two-song E.P. titled \"My Kingdom Come\", (the song \"My Kingdom Come\", written by Russ Ballard) and announced work on a new studio album to be recorded featuring new compositions and a bonus disc consisting of re-recordings of a number of songs from Bonnet's career. The final line-up of The Graham Bonnet Band was: Graham Bonnet, vocals; Conrad Pesinato, guitars; Beth-Ami Heavenstone, bass; Mark Zonder (Ex-Fates Warning), drums. The band resumed touring towards the end of 2016.\n\nOn 4 November 2016, The Graham Bonnet Band released their debut album, \"The Book\". Reviews were positive, with the Real Gone website calling the album \"surprisingly good\" and also stating that some of the tracks \"exceeded expectations by some distance\". Heavenstone later joined Bonnet in a refounded Alcatrazz (see above).\n\nIn 2016, Bonnet joined Michael Schenker and fellow former MSG singers Gary Barden and Robin McAuley in Michael Schenker Fest, initially for a tour of Japan. This resulted in a CD/DVD \"Live - Tokyo International Forum Hall\". Later tours of Europe and Japan followed. In 2017, with the addition of Temple of Rock singer Doogie White (another former Rainbow vocalist), Michael Schenker Fest recorded the album Resurrection featuring vocal contributions from all 4 singers. This line-up toured the US and Europe in 2018.\n\n\n"}

He made 127 Premier League appearances for Bolton Wanderers and more than 250 in the Football League for a variety of clubs, and represented England at under-21 level.\n\nHunt made his professional debut as a substitute for Colin Hendry in the First Division match against Sheffield United on the final day of the 2000–01 regular season, shortly before Bolton Wanderers won promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs. He had to wait some time for further first-team opportunities, only playing in two FA Cup ties (against Sunderland in January 2003) before making his breakthrough at the start of the 2003–04 season when he became a key part of the defence and a first-team regular for Bolton. His Premier League debut came in the 4–0 defeat at Manchester United on 16 August 2003. He made over a century of appearances for the club, scoring once, against Liverpool in February 2004. His form earned him a four-year contract at Bolton, taking him until the end of the 2010–11 season, which he signed on 30 August 2007.\n\nThe departure of Sam Allardyce to Newcastle United and his eventual replacement by Gary Megson saw Hunt fall out of favour at the Reebok Stadium and he joined Championship club Birmingham City on an emergency one-month loan deal as cover for the injured Stuart Parnaby and Stephen Kelly on 3 November 2008. He made his debut the same day, in a 1–0 defeat to Coventry City at St Andrew's. The loan was extended for a further month, but on 30 December, a 24-hour recall clause in the loan agreement was invoked and the player returned to Bolton.\n\nDespite being recalled Hunt played no further role for Bolton in the ensuing year and was again loaned out to a Championship club, this time Derby County, on 7 January 2010 as competition for the club's sole available rightback, Paul Connolly. Initially a month's loan, it was extended until the end of the season.\n\nOn 30 July 2010, Hunt signed a two-year deal with Championship club Bristol City. He made his debut in a 3–0 loss to Millwall. Hunt made seven appearances in the first two months of the season, and an eighth in a 3–1 loss against Leeds United on 13 November, but that was his last for the club. Under Steve Coppell, Hunt was put in the first team which gave Hunt his debut for the club until Coppell's unexpected resignation over his lack of passion for the job. Under Coppell's assistant manager Keith Millen, Hunt was given more playing time until Hunt fell out favour with Millen. Things came to a head when Hunt replaced an injured Louis Carey in a game against Leeds. At the time City were drawing 1–1 in a hard-fought game but went on to lose 3–1. Millen favoured Carey and Jordan Spence at right back until he was sacked. At the start of the 2011–12 season, Millen was keen to offload him but received no offers for the player. On 31 January 2012, Hunt's contract was terminated.\n\nA few days later, Hunt signed a short-term deal with Preston North End as a free agent. He played regularly over the next few months, and was released when his contract expired.\n\nHunt signed for Rotherham United on 22 May 2012. A hamstring tear during a pre-season friendly delayed his competitive debut, he played just a few matches before falling out of favour, and he joined Accrington Stanley on loan in January 2013.\n\nOn his third appearance, Hunt collided with Plymouth Argyle's Ronan Murray, lost consciousness, and was taken to hospital after ten minutes of treatment on the pitch. Once his recovery was well on the way, the loan was extended to the end of the season.\n\nHe signed for Stanley on a two-year deal in June 2013 after Rotherham released him from his contract.\n\nHunt chose to leave Stanley at the end of his contract.\n\nIn June 2015 he signed for Mansfield Town.\n\nIn the January 2016 transfer window, Hunt joined Leyton Orient until the end of the season with an option for a further year. He scored his first goal for Orient in a 3–0 win at Colchester United on 12 November 2016.\n\nOn 1 August 2017, Hunt signed for Notts County. He was released at the end of the season.\n\nOn 31 July 2018, Hunt joined Crewe Alexandra on a one-year deal after a successful trial, making his first team debut on 4 August 2018, coming on as a 29th minute substitute for George Ray in a 6–0 win over Morecambe. He signed a new one-year deal in May 2019. On 12 October 2019, he scored his first Crewe goal (and fourth professional goal) in a 4-2 Crewe win at Carlisle United.\n\nHunt won ten England U21 caps, the first in February 2004 against the Netherlands.\n"}

There is also a path through the valley that leads from Bonnieux to Lacoste (about a 45-minute walk).\n\nThe vernacular architecture and cobblestone streets give the impression of a village where time has stood still. The oldest building in the town, the Maison Forte, dates back to the 9th century while the nearby Pont Julien remains one of the oldest standing examples of a working 1st century B.C. Roman bridge. Finnbar Mac Eoin, author of \"Two Suitcases And A Dog\" lives in Lacoste. He was the last person to drive across The Pont Julien before it closed to traffic in 2005. A plaque states, \"We do not know who was the first person to cross, but an Irishman was the last\".\n\nLacoste is best known for its most notorious resident, Donatien Alphonse Francois comte de Sade, the Marquis de Sade, who in the 18th century lived in the castle, Château de Lacoste, overlooking the village. Following a series of incidents involving local women and the police, the Marquis fled the country but was eventually imprisoned. His castle was partially destroyed in an uprising in 1779 and was later looted and plundered by locals. It is now owned by fashion designer Pierre Cardin, who has partially restored it and holds cultural events there.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century the village saw a brief time of agricultural and economic prosperity from the Roman limestone quarries, but soon hit a slump in the second half of the century and a large portion of the upper village of Lacoste fell into disrepair and ruins.\n\nDuring World War II, the French Resistance took their foothold in the steep Luberon Mountains around Lacoste, and trenches and barbed wire still exist in the forested area in the valley, where resistance fighters prepared to square off with German troops.\n\nTony Perrottet of \"Slate\" said that Lacoste \"always had a contrarian streak,\" citing the fact that Lacoste was a Protestant village surrounded by Catholic communities and that a Communist mayor had been in power for fifty years. There are two small cafes in town where locals and students go to socialize.\n\nThe Marquis fancied Lacoste as a destination for thespians, which has in some small part become true. In the 1990s, the ruins of the castle, along with an attached quarry, were bought by fashion designer Pierre Cardin, and since 1994 musical and theatrical works have been performed there. Cardin founded \"L'Espace Cardin\" in the village of Lacoste as his business and ticketing office, and renovated the quarry into a massive outdoor performance area and stage. Annually, Cardin's festival draws thousands during the month of July for world-class opera, theater, and music set in the quarried stage and coinciding with the Festival d'Avignon, the renowned summer theater and performance festival in the nearby city of Avignon.\n\nAdding to the town's reputation as an artistic haven, The Lacoste School of the Arts was founded in Lacoste in 1970 by American art professor and painter, Bernard Pfriem. Under Pfriem's direction, notable artists came to Lacoste to teach and be inspired by the peace and tranquility of the rural environment, including Benny Andrews, Denis Brihat, Henri Cartier-Bresson, David Douglas Duncan, Nene Humphrey, Gjon Mili, and Jean-Pierre Sudre, among others. The expatriate American poet, Gustaf Sobin, often taught poetry to students at The Lacoste School of the Arts. Through Pfriem and Sobin's leadership, the school emerged to become one of the most respected art programs in France.\n\nSarah Lawrence College, the Cleveland Institute of Art, and Bard College traded partnership with the school before the Savannah College of Art and Design took control in 2002. Today the Savannah College of Art and Design hosts four quarters of classes for art students and professors from all corners of the globe, studying fine arts, writing, architecture, design, fashion, film, photography, sculpture, and theater, to name a few of the subjects. The 30+year history of the Lacoste School of the Arts has helped to infuse a multicultural and worldly artistic sense to the village. The Savannah College of Art and Design recently renovated Maison Basse at the base of the hill village, expanding the number of students who can study in Lacoste each quarter.\n\n\n"}

Written in the early 1890s by Civil War veteran Charles H. Chamberlain (1841–1894, also spelled Chamberlin), the verses were set to the tune of \"Baby Mine\", a popular song composed in 1870 by Archibald Johnston (died 1887). \"Illinois\" became the state song by an act of the 54th Illinois General Assembly in 1925.\n\nThe song was written during the successful campaign to have the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (world's fair) located in Chicago. It was intended for Colonel O.B. Knight, a friend of Mr. Chamberlin, to sing in Illinois and Washington D.C. as support for the nomination of Illinois to host the fair.\n\nWalter Howe Jones (died 1933), Director of the University of Illinois School of Music from 1895 to 1901, set the song lyrics to his own music for male voices in 1901. His version was published in several campus song books but was not widely used.\n\nIn 1925 Florence Fifer Bohrer (1877-1960) of Bloomington, daughter of Governor Joseph W. Fifer (1840-1938) and the first woman Illinois state senator, introduced the bill making \"Illinois\" with Johnston's melody the official state song. The bill was passed on 30 June 1925.\n\nColonel Armin F. Hand (1882?-1966) of Chicago composed a stylized version of the song titled \"Governor's March (Illinois)\" for marching band in 1935, and dedicated it to Governor Henry Horner (1879-1940). In 1949 the University of Illinois football band, the Marching Illini, conducted by Everett Kisinger (1912-1990) adapted this march as their pregame \"Entrance No. 3\" played before each home game. It was revised by James Curnow in 1972.\n\nIn addition to the original four verses of the lyrics, two more were written in 1966 by folk singer Win Stracke (1908-1991) for the 1968 Illinois Sesquicentennial. A marching band arrangement by John Warrington (1911-1978) was issued at the same time.\n\nIn 2018 the Illinois House of Representatives passed HR 184, a resolution encouraging the playing of \"Illinois\" at government events, commencement exercises and other events at state universities. The resolution was drafted by Chicago author Stan \"Tex\" Banash (1940- ) and introduced by State Representative Michael P. McAuliffe (1963- ).\n\nThe following verses were written by Win Stracke in 1966:\n\n"}

In the Ultra-Realm, Savage was merged with Falkon, Prince of Bliss, after his death at the hands of his opposite, Maurkon, Prince of Rage. Seven princes of light existed in the Ultra-Realm (Erosanda: the Prince of Love, the previously mentioned Falkon, Krishlar: the Prince of Peace, Kontentos: the Prince of Grace, Sain: the Prince of Order, Satorana: the Prince of Enlightenment, and Viridium: the Prince of Life) as did their opposites, the seven princes of darkness (Lashtarr: the Prince of Madness, previously mentioned Maurkon, Mortanos: the Prince of Death, Myridian: the Prince of Hate, Shatragon: the Prince of Chaos, Squamonton: the Prince of Greed, and Zorla: the Prince of War).

It is the longest song ever recorded by Oasis. Released on 12 January 1998, the track peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and earned a Silver certification. This was the last Oasis single to be released on the Creation Records label. The song also reached number 15 on the \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs chart.\n\n\"All Around the World\"—nearly ten minutes long—is embellished with string and horn pieces, and is followed by the two-minute-long instrumental \"All Around the World (Reprise)\". Upon its release, the reviews were generally positive. As with many Oasis songs (such as \"Whatever\", \"Acquiesce\", \"Live Forever\") it sends the message that \"everything's gonna be okay\".\n\nThe song was one of the first to be written by Noel, and there are recorded sessions of the band rehearsing it at the Boardwalk club as early as 1992. However, despite Noel's fondness for the song, it did not appear on their first two albums—\"Definitely Maybe\" and \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\"—as he wanted to wait until the band could afford to produce the song in the extravagant manner in which it was to eventually appear. From time to time, Gallagher has claimed that this is one of the best songs he has ever written.\n\nAs early as Spring 1994, the final production sound for this song was envisaged. On the interview Wibbling Rivalry, Noel Gallagher said of the song, \"With Supersonic, I worried I was never going to write another song after that 'cos I thought, 'It sounds that good'... Two days later I superseded it by about 50 fuckin' times. The reason we haven't recorded that song is because there isn't enough money in Creation Records' bank balance to pay for the production of that record. When we do that record...\" Noel also added when asked if there would be an orchestra on it, \"Orchestras, man? It's not got to be one, it's got to be two\".\n\nThe final version premièred on 11 August 1997 on BBC Radio 1's \"The Evening Session\" hosted by Steve Lamacq, ten days before the release of the album, alongside the album tracks \"The Girl in the Dirty Shirt\" and \"Be Here Now\".\n\nNoel described the song shortly before the release of the album: \"I wrote this one ages ago, before 'Whatever'. It was twelve minutes long then. It was a matter of being able to afford to record it. But now we can get away with the 36-piece orchestra. And the longer the better as far as I'm concerned. If it's good. I can see what people are going to say, but fuck 'em, basically.\"\n\n\"The lyrics are teeny-poppy. But there are three key changes towards the end. Imagine how much better \"Hey Jude\" would have been with three key changes towards the end. I like the ambition of it, all that time ago. What was all that about when we didn't even have our first single out? Gin and tonics, eh?\"\n\nThe harmonica pieces on the track were performed by Mark Feltham. Backing vocals were provided by Noel and Liam's then wives, Meg Mathews and Patsy Kensit, along with Richard Ashcroft of The Verve.\n\nWhen it was suggested that Oasis take legal action against pop band Hear'Say for their first single's (\"Pure and Simple\") similarity to \"All Around the World\", Noel simply laughed at the hypocrisy of such an act from a man who was famous for \"borrowing\" from other artists. Portions of the song's chorus were used as background music for AT&T's advertising campaign for \"The New AT&T\".\n\n\"All Around the World\" currently holds the record of being the longest song (9:38) to reach number one in the UK. The photograph on the front of the single was taken on Bournemouth beach in Dorset, England.\n\nA two-minute, ten-second instrumental reprise of the song closes the \"Be Here Now\" album. The reprise ends with the sound of a door being slammed, which has been referred to since as \"the sound of the end of the Britpop-era Oasis\".\n\nOasis\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nKeeping with the feel of the song, the music video was also a lavish affair. Featuring the band in a yellow spaceship, the animated piece saw them travel through a world akin to The Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\" film. The video was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and took 24 computer animators and 6 months to make. It was nominated for a Grammy in 1997. \n\nCD (Promo): Sony Music / SAMPCS 4754\n\nCD: Creation / CRESCD 282\n\n7\": Creation / CRE 282\n\nMC: Creation / CRECS 282\n\n12\": Creation / CRE 282T\n\n"}
{"id": "2027223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027223", "title": "Max Palevsky", "text": "Max Palevsky\n\nMax Palevsky (July 24, 1924 – May 5, 2010) was an American art collector, venture capitalist, philanthropist, and computer technology pioneer.\n\nPalevsky was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Jewish immigrant parents — Izchok (Isadore) Palevsky (born May 10, 1890, in Pinsk, in the Brest Region of the Russian Empire [now in Belarus], died September 27, 1969, in Los Angeles), and Sarah Greenblatt (born May 16, 1894, died December 28, 1949, in Chicago). Izchok had arrived in Baltimore from Bremen, Germany, on the S.S. \"Brandenburg\" on March 18, 1910, while Sarah immigrated around 1916. Palevsky's parents spoke Yiddish fluently, but little English. His father, a house painter, did not have a car and had to use the Chicago streetcars to transport his equipment.\n\nThe youngest of three children, Palevsky grew up at 1925½ Hancock Street in Chicago. His older brother, Harry (September 16, 1919 — September 17, 1990), was a physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Laboratory; his sister, Helen (born 1920), married Melvin M. Futterman (December 28, 1918 – March 14, 1989).\n\nAfter graduating from public high school in Chicago, Palevsky volunteered for the US Army Air Corps as a weatherman during World War II and served from 1943 to 1946. For his training he went for a year to the University of Chicago for basic science and mathematics and Yale University for electronics. He was then sent to New Guinea, which was the Air Force's central base for electronics in the South Pacific. After the war, the GI Bill made it financially feasible for Palevsky to earn a B.S. in mathematics and a B.Ph. in philosophy from the University of Chicago in 1948. Palevsky did graduate work in philosophy at UC Berkeley and the University of Chicago.\n\nAfter attending and resigning from a doctorate program in philosophy at UCLA, where he had served as a teaching assistant in the philosophy department, Palevsky discovered computer technology through a lecture at Caltech by John von Neumann about the advent of computer technology.\n\nPalevsky began working in the computer industry in 1951 for $100 a week building computers at Northrop Aircraft, building copies of the MADIDDA, a special-purpose computer intended to solve differential equations. The MADIDDA was designed by physicist Floyd Steele, and who left Northrup in 1950, a year after the MADIDDA's completion. Palevsky worked to build copies of Steele's invention between March 1950 and January 1951. MADDIDA was priced from $25,000 to $30,000. MADDIDA would prove to be the last and most sophisticated dedicated differential analyzer ever built, since from then on all attention turned to electronic computers.\n\nTwo years after Palevsky joined Northrop, the division was sold to Bendix Corporation. Palevsky worked at Bendix from 1952 to 1956 designing digital differential analyzers as a project engineer, working on the logic design for the company's first computer. In March 1956, Bendix offered their first digital computer, the Bendix G-15, described by some as the first personal computer (a claim that is widely disputed). Palevsky worked on the DA-1 differential analyzer option, which connected to the G-15 and resulted in a machine similar to the MADDIDA, using the G-15 to re-wire the inputs to the analyzer instead of the custom drums and wiring of the earlier machine.\n\nIn March 1957, Palevsky went on to work at Packard Bell Corporation, at a new affiliate of the company that he started, called Packard Bell Computer Corp., in a store front at 11766 W Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles. He was vice president and director of the new division. The new facility launched a research and development program in the digital computer field, with a staff of experienced engineers and skilled technicians to implement the new development. Palevsky convinced the company that they should enter the computer business and helped develop the first silicon computer, which became the PB 250, which was modestly successful. In April 1960, Packard-Bell Computer Corp. and Bailey Meter Co. signed an agreement for the exclusive application of PB250's in the control of power plants. As vice president and general manager of Packard Bell Computer, Palevsky supervised the building of a new building at 1935 Armacost Avenue to house the firm's expanding computer activities, for consolidation of computer and systems engineering and for needed expansion of systems as well as computer manufacturing facilities. Palevsky gave many lectures during this period, including at the second international meeting on analog computation at Strasbourg, France, in September 1958.\n\nPalevsky felt that ten percent of the market of small to medium size scientific and process control computers was being totally neglected. He started looking for venture capital to start a company to address this market, and through contacts from the University of Chicago was able to raise $1 million from Arthur Rock and the Rosenwald family of the Sears Roebuck fortune. He left Packard Bell with eleven associates from the computer division to found Scientific Data Systems of California in September 1961.\n\nWithin a year they introduced the SDS 910, which made the company profitable. Initially, it targeted scientific and medical computing markets. From 1962 to 1965, the company introduced seven computers, all of them commercial successes. On March 15, 1966, they introduced the Sigma 7, the first of a family of machines that marked the full-scale entry of the company into new areas of business data processing, time sharing, and multiprocessing. The Sigma 7 had business capabilities because the once-separate disciplines of business and scientific electronic data processing had developed to the point where one machine could handle both. SDS captured a little more than two per cent of the overall digital computer market in 1966 and continued to grow with the market.\n\nPalevsky sold SDS to Xerox in May 1969 for $920 million, with Arthur Rock's assistance, at which time he became a director and Chairman of the Executive Committee of Xerox Corporation. Palevsky's initial investment of $60,000 in SDS became nearly $100 million at the sale. He retired as a director of Xerox in May 1972.\n\nIn 1972 Palevsky donated $300,000 to George McGovern, and in 1973 he managed Tom Bradley's first successful campaign for mayor of Los Angeles. He made numerous friends and allies on the California political scene, including former governor Gray Davis, and was elected to serve on Common Cause's National Governing Board in 1973. Many were dismayed at Palevsky's $1 million contribution in support of California Proposition 25, a campaign-finance reform initiative. He said to \"Newsweek\": \"I am making this million-dollar contribution in hopes that I will never again legally be allowed to write huge checks to California political candidates.\"\n\nAs a venture capitalist, Palevsky helped to fund many companies, including Intel, which grew to become one of the nation's leading semiconductor companies and a pioneer in the development of memory chips and microprocessors. Palevsky became a director along with Arthur Rock, who helped bankroll SDS, at the company's founding, on July 18, 1968, as NM Electronics Corporation, a name later changed to Intel (August 6, 1968). Intel was funded with $2 million in venture capital assembled by Arthur Rock. Palevsky became a director emeritus in February 1998.\n\nPalevsky also became a director and chairman of \"Rolling Stone\", which he rescued from financial ruin in 1970 by buying a substantial share of the stock. While on the board he became friends with the late Hunter S. Thompson, inventor of what came to be called Gonzo journalism. In December 1970, Cinema V, a movie-theater distribution operation, entered film production in a joint venture, Cinema X, with Palevsky. Palevsky went into independent production with Peter Bart, former production vice president of Paramount Pictures in November 1973, with a Paramount contract to produce six features in three years. Palevsky produced and bankrolled several Hollywood films, including \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" and \"Islands in the Stream\" both with Peter Bart in 1977, and \"Endurance\" in 1998. Author Albert Goldman dedicated his controversial 1988 biography \"The Lives of John Lennon\" to Palevsky. In June 1977, Palevsky was elected to the board of the American Ballet Theater.\n\nPalevsky also served as a director and Chairman of the Board of Silicon Systems Inc. of Tustin, California, from April 1983 until February 1984; as chairman and chief executive of the board of Daisy Systems Corporation, a maker of computer systems used to design electronic circuits based in Mountain View, California; and, from November 1984 to 1999, as a director of Komag Corp., a Milpitas, California, based maker of data storage media.\n\nPalevsky also collected art, particularly Japanese woodblock prints, and gave generously to establish and maintain institutions of visual art. He established the Palevsky Design Pavilion at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. He also built an Arts & Crafts collection at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), and donated $1 million to help establish the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.

He established the Palevsky Professorship in History and Civilization in 1972 and the Palevsky Faculty Fund in 1996.\n\nIn 2000, Palevsky donated $20 million to his alma mater to enhance residential life. In 2001, the University completed construction on three large colorful dorms that are connected through tunnels and bear his name. A one-screen cinema at the University is also named after him, and is the home of Doc Films, the oldest continuously running student film association in the United States.\n\nPalevsky was married six times and divorced five. He had five children. He was married to his first wife, Mary Joan Yates (Joan Palevsky), from 1952 to 1968. With her huge divorce settlement, the largest at that time in California, she became a renowned philanthropist. With Max, she had two children, Madeleine Moskowitz and Nicholas Palevsky. His second wife was Sara Jane Brown, whom he married on September 6, 1969. In November 1972, he married Lynda L. Edelstein, his third wife, the mother of his sons, Alexander and Jonathan Palevsky. Jodie Evans, his fourth and sixth wife and widow, is a political activist and mother of Matthew Palevsky. \n\nPalevsky owned homes notable for their architecture, furniture, and art collections. \"Three California Houses: The Homes of Max Palevsky\" featured architecture and design by Ettore Sottsass of the Memphis group, Craig Ellwood, George Washington Smith, and Coy Howard.\n\nIn 1985 and 1988, Palevsky was named to the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans. His estimated worth for those years was $200 million (1985) and $240 million (1988).\n\nPalevsky died at the age of 85 of heart failure on May 5, 2010, at his home in Beverly Hills, California.\n\n\n"}

The school was founded in 1950 by Bernard Fulton. The campus is located north of downtown Dallas, Texas and enrolls about 1,270 students from throughout the Dallas Metroplex. The school is the first co-educational, non-denominational Pre-Kindergarten through grade 12 school in Dallas and is a member of both the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest (ISAS) and the Southwest Preparatory Conference (SPC).\n\nGreenhill School was founded in 1950 as a co-educational option among the independent schools in Dallas. From 1950 to 1976, Bernard Fulton served as the founding headmaster, and at the time, he introduced the concepts of independent co-education, the primer program, and open-space education while the school grew from 62 students to 1,002. After he retired from Greenhill School, he became the headmaster of Lakehill Preparatory School, and later, Fulton Academy in Rockwall, Texas, was named after him as well. On October 20, 1990, Governor Bill Clements declared Bernard Fulton Day “for his dedication to the education of young people in Dallas, in Texas, and in the nation.\"\n\nFrom 1955 to 1959, late State Representative Fred Agnich of Dallas was chairman of the board of the Greenhill School and was instrumental in the early development of the institution.\n\nThe original Upper School building was a part of a farmhouse that was on the land prior to the school. It also housed Greenhill's library, cafeteria, and administrative offices. Unfortunately, in 1963, a fire decimated the building, leaving nothing in its wake. Due to Greenhill's tenacious spirit, classes resumed only 48 hours later. It took nearly 13 years, but the Upper School students got their new permanent building, named after the beloved founder Bernard Fulton, opening for its first day in 1974. But alas, on the morning of March 30, 1987, the fire department was notified that another fire had started in the Bernard Fulton Upper School building. The building was again decimated, and classes were displaced into library corners and temporary buildings. Again, the bright spirit of Greenhill shown through, and soon the phrase \"Greenhill is not buildings... it's people!\" Students and faculty all came together to assist in the cleanup and restoration that enabled the reopening of the Bernard Fulton Upper School on February 5, 1988.\nGreenhill's academic structure consists of each subject having a Division Head while Pre-K-12 Department Chairs supervise the curriculum. The school is divided into four sections: Preschool, Lower School, Middle School, and finally the Upper School, which houses about 471 students (9-12) with about 115 in each grade. In 2001, the school was ranked top 40 in public and private schools in Worth Magazine by the number of matriculants to Harvard University, Princeton, and Yale. Besides these, students in the last four years have been accepted into colleges such as Stanford University, Vassar College, Emory University, Northwestern University, Southern Methodist University, Texas Christian University, Harvard University, New York University, Rice University, Yale University, Wake Forest University, Dartmouth College, Boston College, Brown University, Duke University, Trinity University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Pratt Institute, Vanderbilt University, and Washington University in St. Louis. The Upper School offers 15 AP courses. The average SAT scores for the Class of 2008 were 675 verbal, 673 math, and 665 writing. The Class of 2008 also had 21 commended finalists for National Merit scholarships, and 10 actual finalists for the scholarship. Academically, only three other private schools in the Dallas-Fort Worth area have achieved similar levels of prestige: St. Marks School of Texas, the Hockaday School, and Cistercian Preparatory School. In addition to academics, students are also required to complete 48 hours of community service upon graduation.\n\nGreenhill has a population of 1318 students; of those students, 471 of them are enrolled in the Upper School. The Greenhill policy “admits students without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national or ethnic origin, or disabilities.” The admissions process begins in the fall, and applications are accepted one year prior to the year of expected entrance. Applicants take the CATS test in grades Pre-K to Primer and the ISEE test in grades 1-12. Interviews, academics scores, test scores, Teacher Recommendations, Group observation test, extra-curriculars, athletic achievements, citizenship, and service are evaluated by the committee. After these materials have been noted, the applicant is subject to three decisions: invited, waitpool, and non-acceptance. The Financial Aid Committee works to make sure that Greenhill is an affordable option. Families must reapply for financial aid each year.\n\nEach year, the incoming seniors paint the Water Tower in the parking lot with graffiti. They spray their names on it with an overriding theme and picture to depict their grade.\n\nOn the first day of school, students come to school on campus with a painted water tower. The senior class comes to school with females dressed in white and males dressed in black. The whole school also attends an assembly in the Phillips Gymnasium to ring in the new year.\n\nFounder's Day is the annual September 11 celebration of Greenhill's establishment on September 11, 1950. The whole school meets in the Phillips Gymnasium for an assembly to commemorate two teachers and honor five faculty members. The Student Council President (a senior) lights the Founder's Day Candle with the current longest working faculty member. During the assembly, the Service-Learning and Community Service Program announces the Estelle Dickens service project for the year. Legacy Heart of the Hill groups are named during this assembly. The Heart of the Hill program brings groups of students from each division—Lower, Middle and Upper—together to help instill a sense of community across the campus.\n\nThe Alumni Association holds the annual senior breakfast in the fall for the graduating seniors. During this time, the graduating seniors meet with alumni and are given their senior sweatshirts.\n\nGreenhill is a member of the Southwest Preparatory Conference which includes private schools from Texas and Oklahoma. Students start playing athletics for the school when they enter the 7th grade and are able to participate in Basketball, Baseball, Cheerleading, Cross Country, Diving, Golf, Field Hockey, Football, Lacrosse, Soccer, Softball, Swimming, Tennis, Track and Field, and Volleyball. Greenhill has had many prominent athletes such as Ashley Rape (Class of 2008) who was featured in Sports Illustrated, and Parade All-America. She played Duke University and was selected as Gatorade Texas Girl Soccer Player of the Year for 2007-2008. Chelsey Sveinsson (Class of 2011) was selected as SportsDay's 2007 Girls Newcomer of the Year and was selected as Gatorade Texas Girls Cross Country Runner of the Year for 2007-2008, 2008-2009, and 2009-2010. Sveinsson also won the 2008 Nike National Cross Country Championship.\n\nThe following records were found at the Greenhill Website and the Southwest Preparatory Conference Website. Due to the lack of retained information, some championships have not been recorded.\nGreenhill offers courses of study in visual arts, photography, band, orchestra, choir, dance, technical theater, debate, drama, and video production. Every year, the Upper School Fine Arts program travels to a different school in the country for the ISAS Fine Arts festival.\n\nIn 2000, the National Forensic League recognized Greenhill Debate as one of the top programs of the 20th Century. Greenhill holds many wins at the National Tournament of Champions. In addition, Greenhill won the Baker Award, given to the overall top policy team in the nation in 2012.\n\nAdditionally, the school hosts a program called RockTalk which has featured artists such as The Fray, Saving Abel, Simple Plan, Bowling for Soup, Jonathan Tyler and the Northern Lights, Sorta, and Aranda.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2027247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027247", "title": "Romanesque Revival architecture", "text": "Romanesque Revival architecture\n\nRomanesque Revival (or Neo-Romanesque) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture. Unlike the historic Romanesque style, however, Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts.\n\nAn early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil (\"Round-arched style\") was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s. By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free \"Romanesque\" manner was Henry Hobson Richardson. In the United States, the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque, of which not all are Romanesque Revival.\n\nRomanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the \"Norman style\" or \"Lombard style\", particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards, respectively.\nLike its influencing Romanesque style, the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches, and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898, and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929.\nThe style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century, especially in the United States and Canada; well known examples can be found at the University of California, Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Tulane University, University of Denver, University of Toronto, and Wayne State University.\n\nThe development of the Norman revival style took place over a long time in the British Isles, starting with Inigo Jones's refenestration of the White Tower of the Tower of London in 1637–38 and work at Windsor Castle by Hugh May for Charles II, but this was little more than restoration work. In the 18th century, the use of round arched windows was thought of as being Saxon rather than Norman, and examples of buildings with round arched windows include Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire, Wentworth in Yorkshire, and Enmore Castle in Somerset. In Scotland the style started to emerge with the Duke of Argyl's castle at Inverary, started in 1744, and castles by Robert Adam at Culzean (1771), Oxenfoord (1780–82), Dalquharran, (1782–85) and Seton Palace, 1792. In England James Wyatt used round arched windows at Sandleford Priory, Berkshire, in 1780–89 and the Duke of Norfolk started to rebuild Arundel Castle, while Eastnor Castle in Herefordshire was built by Robert Smirke between 1812 and 1820.\n\nAt this point, the Norman Revival became a recognisable architectural style. In 1817, Thomas Rickman published his \"An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest To the Reformation\". It was now realised that 'round-arch architecture' was largely Romanesque in the British Isles and came to be described as Norman rather than Saxon. The start of an \"archaeologically correct\" Norman Revival can be recognised in the architecture of Thomas Hopper. His first attempt at this style was at Gosford Castle in Armagh in Ireland, but far more successful was his Penrhyn Castle near Bangor in North Wales. This was built for the Pennant family, between 1820 and 1837. The style did not catch on for domestic buildings, though many country houses and mock castles were built in the Castle Gothic or Castellated style during the Victorian period, which was a mixed Gothic style.\n\nHowever, the Norman Revival did catch on for church architecture. Thomas Penson, a Welsh architect, would have been familiar with Hopper's work at Penrhyn, who developed Romanesque Revival church architecture. Penson was influenced by French and Belgian Romanesque Revival architecture, and particularly the earlier Romanesque phase of German Brick Gothic. At St David's Newtown, 1843–47, and St Agatha's Llanymynech, 1845, he copied the tower of St. Salvator's Cathedral, Bruges. Other examples of Romanesque revival by Penson are Christ Church, Welshpool, 1839–1844, and the porch to Langedwyn Church. He was an innovator in his use of Terracotta to produce decorative Romanesque mouldings, saving on the expense of stonework. Penson's last church in the Romanesque Revival style was Rhosllannerchrugog, Wrexham 1852\n\nThe Romanesque adopted by Penson contrasts with the Italianate Romanesque of other architects such as Thomas Henry Wyatt, who designed Saint Mary and Saint Nicholas Church, in this style at Wilton, which was built between 1841 and 1844 for the Dowager Countess of Pembroke and her son, Lord Herbert of Lea. During the 19th century, the architecture selected for Anglican churches depended on the churchmanship of particular congregations. Whereas high churches and Anglo-Catholic, which were influenced by the Oxford Movement, were built in Gothic Revival architecture, low churches and broad churches of the period were often built in the Romanesque Revival style. Some of the later examples of this Romanesque Revival architecture is seen in Non-conformist or Dissenting churches and chapels. A good example of this is by the Lincoln architects Drury and Mortimer, who designed the Mint Lane Baptist Chapel in Lincoln in a debased Italianate Romanesque revival style in 1870. After about 1870 this style of Church architecture in Britain disappears, but in the early 20th century, the style is succeeded by Byzantine Revival architecture.\n\nTwo of Canada's provincial legislatures, the Ontario Legislative Building in Toronto and the British Columbia Parliament Buildings in Victoria, are Romanesque Revival in style.\n\nUniversity College, one of seven colleges at the University of Toronto, is an example of the Romanesque Revival style. Construction of the final design began on 4 October 1856.\n\nThe Vasa Church in Gothenburg, Sweden, is another prime example of the Neo-Romanesque style of architecture.\n\nThe Church of the Pilgrims—now the Maronite Cathedral of Our Lady of Lebanon—in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, designed by Richard Upjohn and built 1844–46, is generally considered the first work of Romanesque Revival architecture in the United States. It was soon followed by a more prominent design for the Smithsonian Institution Building in Washington, DC, designed by James Renwick, Jr. and built 1847–51. Renwick allegedly submitted two proposals to the design competition, one Gothic and the other Romanesque in the style. The Smithsonian chose the latter, which was based on designs from German architecture books.\nSeveral concurrent forces contributed to the popularizing of the Romanesque Revival in the United States. The first was an influx of German immigrants in the 1840s, who brought the style of the Rundbogenstil with them. Second, a series of works on the style was published concurrently with the earliest built examples. The first of these, \"Hints on Public Architecture\", written by social reformer Robert Dale Owen in 1847–48, was prepared for the Building Committee of the Smithsonian Institution and prominently featured illustrations of Renwick's Smithsonian Institution Building. Owen argued that Greek Revival architecture—then the prevailing style in the United States for everything from churches to banks to private residences—was unsuitable as a national American style. He maintained that the Greek temples upon which the style was based had neither the windows, chimneys, nor stairs required by modern buildings, and that the low-pitched temple roofs and tall colonnades were ill-adapted to cold northern climates. To Owen, most Greek Revival buildings thus lacked architectural truth, because they attempted to hide 19th-century necessities behind classical temple facades. In its place, he offered that the Romanesque style was ideal for a more flexible and economic American architecture.\n\nAustin Hall at Harvard Law School, completed in 1884, is another example of Romanesque Revival, and now includes a courtroom and classrooms as well as administrative offices.\n\nSoon after, the Congregational Church published \"A Book of Plans for Churches and Parsonages\" in 1853, containing 18 designs by 10 architects, including Upjohn, Renwick, Henry Austin, and Gervase Wheeler, most in the Romanesque Revival style. Richard Salter Storrs and other clergy on the book's committee were members or frequent preachers of Upjohn's Church of the Pilgrims.\nSt. Joseph Church in Hammond, Indiana, is Romanesque Revival.\n\nThe exterior of the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on New York City's Upper East Side, completed in 1932, is Romanesque Revival.\n\n"}
{"id": "2027249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027249", "title": "Oval", "text": "Oval\n\nAn oval (from Latin \"ovum\", \"egg\") is a closed curve in a plane which \"loosely\" resembles the outline of an egg. The term is not very specific, but in some areas (projective geometry, technical drawing, etc.) it is given a more precise definition, which may include either one or two axes of symmetry. In common English, the term is used in a broader sense: any shape which reminds one of an egg. The three-dimensional version of an oval is called an ovoid.\n\nThe term oval when used to describe curves in geometry is not well-defined, except in the context of projective geometry. Many distinct curves are commonly called ovals or are said to have an \"oval shape\". Generally, to be called an oval, a plane curve should \"resemble\" the outline of an egg or an ellipse. In particular, these are common traits of ovals:\n\nHere are examples of ovals described elsewhere:\n\nAn ovoid is the surface in 3-dimensional space generated by rotating an oval curve about one of its axes of symmetry.\nThe adjectives ovoidal and ovate mean having the characteristic of being an ovoid, and are often used as synonyms for \"egg-shaped\".\n\n\nFor \"finite\" planes (i.e. the set of points is finite) there is a more convenient characterization:\n\nAn ovoid in a projective space is a set of points such that:\n\nIn the \"finite\" case only for dimension 3 there exist ovoids. A convenient characterization is:\n\nThe shape of an egg is approximated by the \"long\" half of a prolate spheroid, joined to a \"short\" half of a roughly spherical ellipsoid, or even a slightly oblate spheroid. These are joined at the equator and share a principal axis of rotational symmetry, as illustrated above. Although the term \"egg-shaped\" usually implies a lack of reflection symmetry across the equatorial plane, it may also refer to true prolate ellipsoids. It can also be used to describe the 2-dimensional figure that, if revolved around its major axis, produces the 3-dimensional surface.\n\nIn technical drawing, an oval is a figure constructed from two pairs of arcs, with two different radii (see image on the right). The arcs are joined at a point in which lines tangential to both joining arcs lie on the same line, thus making the joint smooth. Any point of an oval belongs to an arc with a constant radius (shorter or longer), but in an ellipse, the radius is continuously changing.\n\nIn common speech, \"oval\" means a shape rather like an egg or an ellipse, which may be two-dimensional or three-dimensional. It also often refers to a figure that resembles two semicircles joined by a rectangle, like a cricket infield, speed skating rink or an athletics track. However, this is more correctly called a stadium. Sometimes, it can even refer to any rectangle with rounded corners.\n\nThe terms \"ellipse\" and \"oblong\" are often used interchangibly with oval, despite not being precise synonyms.\n\n"}

He graduated from Mount Hermon School, MA, in 1902 (now the Northfield Mount Hermon School). He attended Adams College which was part of the mission.\n\nHis mother was a sister of John Langalibalele Dube, and descended from a local chief. At 17 years of age Seme left to study in the U.S., first at the Mount Hermon School and then Columbia University. In 1906, his senior year at University, he was awarded the Curtis Medal, Columbia's highest oratorical honor. He subsequently decided to become an attorney. In October 1906 he was admitted to Oxford University to read for the degree of Bachelor of Civil Law; while at Oxford he was a member of Jesus College. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 12 February 1907 and was Called to the Bar on 8 June 1910.\n\nSeme returned to South Africa in 1910, and began to practice as a lawyer in Johannesburg.\n\nIn 1911, Seme established the South African Native Farmers Association in order to encourage black farm workers to buy land in the Daggakraal area, and thus attain personal independence. Consequently, this led the white government to enact the Natives Land Act of 1913, barring black people from owning land in South Africa.\n\nIn response to the formation of the Union of South Africa, Seme worked with several other young African leaders recently returned from university studies in England, Richard Msimang, George Montsioa and Alfred Mangena, and with established leaders of the South African Native Convention in Johannesburg to promote the formation of a national organization that would unify various African groups from the separate colonies. In January 1912, these efforts bore fruit with the founding meeting of the South African Native National Congress, later renamed the African National Congress.\n\nSeme was also the lawyer of Queen Regent Labotsibeni of Swaziland, through whom the first ANC newspaper \"Abantu-Batho\" was financed. Later, in 1922, Seme accompanied King Sobhuza II as part of a delegation to London to meet British authorities and the King regarding the land proclamation in Swaziland.\n\nSeme's nationalist organizing among Africans paralleled the contemporaneous efforts of Mohandas Gandhi with South African Indians.\n\nSeme was very close to the Zulu and Swazi royal families. This is primarily symbolized by his marriage to Phikisele Harriet Dinizulu, the daughter of Zulu king Dinuzulu, and to Lozinja, daughter of Swazi King Mbandzeni.\n\n\n"}

Begun in 1826, it was not completed until 1861 and was closed in 1871. Currently small craft use the river and lakes, but only one lock is operational. Three of the nine locks have been restored to preserve their unique fusion of British and North American construction techniques. More extensive restoration is planned.\n\nThe Shubenacadie Canal was originally surveyed by William Owen in 1767 which lead to the proposal of the canal 30 years later. The government of Nova Scotia commissioned Owen to follow the Shubenacadie waterway from the Atlantic Ocean to Cobequid Bay. The Shubenacadie Canal was envisioned to facilitate transportation between Halifax and the agricultural, timber and coal producing areas of northern Nova Scotia and the Annapolis Valley. Construction was started in 1826 by the Shubenacadie Canal Co. which went bankrupt in 1831. Several Scottish and Irish stonemasons had immigrated to Nova Scotia to work on the project but were left stranded in the colony with few resources after the project had halted. Construction started again in 1854 under the Inland Navigation Company. The new company altered the original British stonework lock designs to use more inexpensive North American stone and wooden construction. Steam boats and barges began to use the canal in 1856 and the entire system was completed by 1861. The canal enjoyed a few years of healthy traffic especially during the Waverley gold rushes of the 1860s. However the canal company showed little profit and experienced many problems relating to frigid winters which damaged the locks linking the freshwater lakes.\n\nThe president of the Canal company was Michael Wallace (politician).\n\nThe canal's ongoing construction delays were partly responsible for the 1851 decision by Nova Scotia's colonial government to build the Nova Scotia Railway, which built lines from Halifax to Windsor and Truro by 1858. Railway construction created a short-term surge in canal traffic but a decision in 1870 by the Intercolonial Railway to replace the Waverley draw bridge over the canal with a fixed bridge blocked canal steamships and severely limited canal traffic, a conflict related to the frog wars which plagued rival railways crossings. A final blow was a takeover by the Town of Dartmouth of the Dartmouth Lakes for the city's water supply which ended canal operations in 1871.\n\nThe community of Maitland was part of the Douglas Township until it was named Maitland after Governor General of Nova Scotia Peregrine Maitland (1828–34), when building the Shubenacadie Canal was first attempted (1826–1831). The canal was supposed to start at Maitland, Nova Scotia and run through the province to Maitland Street, Dartmouth, the canal being \"bookended\" by two \"Maitland\" landmarks.\n\nThe canal followed the course below, running north from Halifax Harbour at Dartmouth Cove:\n\n\nIn recent decades people have not used the canal because it has poisson in it, citizens of Dartmouth sought to restore portions of the canal's portage route between the lakes running from Halifax Harbour to Shubenacadie Grand Lake for pleasure boaters. Highway construction, notably low bridges crossing the Lake Banook-Lake Micmac connection (Highway 111) and Lake Thomas (Highway 102) resulted in blocking the historic canal route to larger vessels, although canoes and small pleasure boats may still pass underneath.\n\nThe Shubenacadie Canal Commission was established to stabilize the deterioration of the remaining locks and attempt to restore some of them to working order. An interpretive site for the canal is located in the Fairbanks Centre in Dartmouth's Shubie Park, along the shores of Lake Micmac. Located next to one of the restored operational locks, the Fairbanks Centre features a scale model of canal lock mechanisms.\n\nSome areas along the Shubenacadie Canal are popular outdoor recreation areas for the Halifax Regional Municipality, including:\n\n\nThe Trans-Canada Trail is currently being planned to run alongside part of the canal.\n\nEnvironmentalists and residents became concerned in 2005 when it was discovered that large amounts of silt were flowing off the Dartmouth Crossing mall project construction site and into the canal. After heavy hurricane-season rains, run-off from the construction overflowed containment ponds and began running into the canal, Lake Charles, Lake Micmac, and Shubie Park's Grassy Brook.\n\nDartmouth Crossing is located on Highway 118 across from Shubie Park. Measures were taken to mitigate the silt run-off and construction continued on the mall project.\n\n\n\n"}

It intersects Hijirizaka, which runs southwest from the head of the promontory. In the Edo period, one could look out from the slope and see Tokyo Bay. This caused the slope to become a well-known scene of Edo-era Japan. It is often used in ukiyo-e prints. Many hill roads in Japan bear the name \"Shiomizaka\". The name carries a dual meaning in Japanese; the most common is one is \"watch the tide\" and another is \"see death.\" (Similar dual meanings occur in Japanese, for example Fujimi has two meaning, one is \"look at Mt. Fuji,\" another is \"become immortal.\") The names of the roads are attributed to Edo Shogunate founder Tokugawa Ieyasu who was given the territory by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. It is said that he gave the slopes the names \"shiomi\" and \"fujimi\" because had faced the many crisis and overcame it in his life, that is Shi wo mite, and Fujimi ni naru.\n"}
{"id": "2027279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027279", "title": "Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)", "text": "Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)\n\nSons and Daughters is an Australian Logie Award-winning soap opera/drama serial created by Reg Watson and produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation between 1981 and 1987. The first episode aired on Monday 18 January 1982, during the Christmas/New Year non-ratings period in both Sydney and Melbourne, and the broadcast date of the final episode varied across Australia. The final episode was screened in Sydney on Sunday 27 December 1987 and in Melbourne on Sunday 10 January 1988 (again in the non-ratings period). Adelaide station ADS7 was one of the first to complete the series, showing the final episodes in a two-hour special on Monday 16 November 1987.\n\nOne of the most popular series in the early 1980s, there are 972 half-hour episodes, but during the series' original run in Australia, later episodes were shown in an hour-long format - from the start of the 1984 season in Sydney and the 1985 season in Melbourne. This varied in other TV markets and regional stations, with some adopting the one-hour format as early as 1982. The pilot episode was shown in Australia and some UK ITV regions as a 90-minute special, although subsequent screenings have seen that episode split into three half-hours. The program has been broadcast internationally, and has been particularly popular in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Belgium.\n\"Sons and Daughters\" was created by television executive Reg Watson who was inspired by glossy US prime-time soaps \"Dallas\" and \"Dynasty\", which were averaging huge ratings in their respective time slots on CBS and ABC and was curious to see how an Australian half-hour soap similar in style to those shows would fare with early evening or prime-time audiences. The show was an instant hit and with writers for the show being able to place one or more families and other characters in either Sydney or Melbourne, they knew the show would appeal to viewers living in those cities. Watson knew Melbourne-based shows often did not rate well with Sydney viewers, and set about using either Sydney or Melbourne as the birthplace for much of the show's cast of characters. \"Sons and Daughters\" even used some former plot lines from \"Dallas\" or \"Dynasty\" to gain high viewership figures for the show's timeslot. Critics and press likened the serial as an Australian version of Latin American or South American telenovelas which would often hit huge viewership figures in their home country. British television broadcaster ITV would soon begin airing the show and audiences in the United Kingdom and other European territories would begin to become fans of the show. Most European and foreign countries that aired the show broadcast it in daytime. Ratings for the show would be very high for the first three years, but following the departure of Rowena Wallace in early 1985 to pursue other acting opportunities, ratings quickly began to decline, and a wacky and rather dull idea was put in play for Wallace's character Patricia Hamilton to return to the soap played by another actress. In mid-1985, new actress to the show Belinda Giblin arrived as Alison Carr, the new identity of Patricia, who had plastic surgery in Rio de Janeiro to escape from authorities who were looking for her in Australia for supposedly murdering a wealthy millionaire's son named Luke Carlyle, who had embezzled his father's and Patricia's firm. Patricia used this new identity to regain entry into Australia and with an instant boost to viewership figures watching the storyline the show was deemed to be saved from cancellation. However, when Wallace returned to the show in its final season, as Patricia's/Alison's twin, Pamela, ratings began to slide and after six successful years the show ended in 1987 and would be replaced with new half-hour soap \"Home and Away\", created by Alan Bateman, and featuring former \"Sons and Daughters\" screenwriter Bevan Lee. \"Sons and Daughters\" is best remembered for its over-the-top storylines and dramatic, and often hilarious, cliffhangers. One such cliffhanger featured character Alison Carr (Belinda Giblin) being bitten by a venomous snake, which had been hidden in a wall safe that Alison broke into to steal documents from villain Wayne Hamilton, played by Ian Rawlings. Though the snake used, a python, would have a non-lethal bite, that storyline featuring the infamous snake cliffhanger was often credited as a way to try and increase ratings for the show. Another rather spurious storyline featured a bomb being hidden in the bottom of wheelchair that killed off Barney Adams, a love interest of Fiona Thompson, when it exploded. The show gained a cult following and has been repeated more than once in both Australian and international territories.\n\n\"Sons and Daughters\" won the 1983 Logie Award for Most Popular Australian Drama. Rowena Wallace was the most nominated actress of the soap and was nominated for a Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television at the 26th Annual TV Week Logie Awards in 1984, and went on to win the award the following year in 1985. She was the first woman to win the award since it was opened up to Most Popular Australian Personality.\n\nWallace also received Silver Logies for:\n\nOther awards won by \"Sons and Daughters\" cast members include:\nMost Popular New Talent – Stephen Comey (1982)\n\nThe theme tune was written by partners Peter Pinne & Don Battye and performed by Mick Leyton and Kerrie Biddell. Two main versions of the theme were used in the closing credits, one in 3/4 time and one in 4/4 time: the first version was used as the main closing theme for most episodes shown in 1982 and 1983, while the second version was used from 1984 to 1987. In addition. The full theme tune was released on a 7-inch single in the UK in 1984 and reached number 68 in the charts and stayed in the charts for three weeks. It was released on the A1 record label with catalogue number 'A1 286'.\n\nThe initial premise for the show was a \"Romeo and Juliet\"-style romance storyline which revolved around two families, the wealthy Hamilton family who lived in Sydney, and the Palmers, a working-class family from Melbourne. The characters of John Palmer (Peter Phelps) and spoilt rich girl Angela Hamilton (Ally Fowler) meet by chance whilst John is on the run from the police for a murder he did not commit. The two fall in love, not realising that they are actually twins, separated at birth 20 years earlier following an affair between their parents, David Palmer (Tom Richards) and Patricia (Rowena Wallace). Early episodes saw the pair discover the truth about their heritage and showed the problems and strains this put on their own relationship and those of their immediate families. While on the run John is protected in Sydney by Fiona Thompson (Pat McDonald), a former madame and prostitute and now boarding house owner who had raised John when he was a young boy. With a new identity and now going by the name of Scott Edwards, John attempts to build a new life, with the help of Fiona and her friend Jill Taylor (Kim Lewis), another former prostitute.\n\nFollowing the shock revelation of John and Angela's true heritage and the subsequent reunion of the two families, a series of dramatic events unfolds, intertwining the lives of both the Palmers and the Hamiltons. The Palmers' newly-wed daughter Susan (Ann Henderson-Stiers) receives the shock revelation that her husband Bill Todd is responsible for the murder of which John was suspected, and Bill is subsequently convicted and jailed. The Palmers' youngest son Kevin (Stephen Comey) and his girlfriend Lynn Hardy (Antonia Murphy) find their lives turned upside down when she becomes pregnant, despite their families' best efforts to keep them apart. Father and son David and John Palmer's relationship continues to deteriorate, and when David and Patricia meet up again 20 years on from their initial affair, old passions resurface, culminating in the destruction of both their marriages—David's marriage to dedicated housewife Beryl (Leila Hayes) and Patricia's marriage to the wealthy and successful businessman Gordon (Brian Blaine). Amidst a web of intrigue concerning the numerous instabilities within both families, and shady big-business deals concerning Gordon's company, his ownership of country estate Woombai, and the increasing involvement of his manipulative son Wayne (Ian Rawlings), the drama builds throughout the season.\n\nThe character of Patricia rapidly developed into the main focus of the show, with her neurotic bitchiness and scheming being the source of most of the drama and tension between the other characters. Patricia became a popular character among viewers and was dubbed 'Pat the Rat' by the media. New characters introduced later in the season included Patricia's best friend, the dizzy socialite Charlie Bartlett (Sarah Kemp), Rob Keegan (Noel Hodda), the younger brother of Beryl Palmer who falls in love with and marries Angela, and Paul Sheppard (Mark Ferguson), the morally confused and neurotic grandson of Patricia's former lover James Sheppard, who left Patricia a substantial amount of his fortune following his death.\n\nEnd-of-season cliffhanger – Season 1 (Episode 174): As John and Angela celebrate their 21st birthday and the whole of the Palmer family celebrates at the Palmer household, Patricia—who has been forbidden by the Palmers from attending—attempts to gatecrash. As David tries to stop her from entering the party, Patricia shocks him with the revelation that he is not the twins' father after all, and she has been lying to him and everyone else for years about the twins' true father.\n\nAs season 2 kicks off, Patricia is sinking further into depression after she overdoses on sleeping pills and Susan steps in to help take care of her as a live-in nurse, while scheming Wayne tricks Patricia into signing her power of attorney over to him to give him power over his father, Gordon. Shortly after, Susan becomes the first of the main cast to depart the series as she leaves to be closer to her husband Bill's prison. John tracks down his real father Martin Healy—a prominent officer in the Air Force—and also manages to find Patricia's estranged sister Margaret (Ilona Rodgers). The reunion of Patricia with Martin and Margaret sparks off a series of dramatic storylines as old secrets are revealed and old tensions between Patricia and Margaret resurface. A major turning point in the series comes with the suicide of Martin Healy after past crimes catch up with him, and when Margaret removes his suicide note from beside the body, David comes under suspicion of Martin's murder.\n\nOther plot developments included Gordon's marriage to the Hamiltons' neighbour Barbara Armstrong (Cornelia Frances), and Jill's involvement with illegal Irish immigrant Brian O'Donnell, whom she agrees to marry so he can obtain a visa to stay in the country. Jill is raped by drifter Terry Hansen (Andrew Clarke), who is revealed to be Fiona's long-lost son. In a highly controversial storyline, Terry was treated by the scriptwriters as a sympathetic character despite the rape and his subsequent spell in prison. Fiona is shattered when her boarding house in Manly burns down, almost killing Jill in the inferno. A heated love triangle occurs between the characters of Angela, Rob Keegan and Paul Sheppard, following which all three characters depart the show. After Gordon and Barbara enter a business deal with Barbara's brother Stephen Morrell (Michael Long), they are shocked when Stephen suddenly marries Patricia after a whirlwind romance. This leads to the introduction of a third family for the show—the Morrells, including Stephen's mother Dee (Mary Ward), a ruthless elderly businesswoman, and his daughter Amanda (Alyce Platt). Following Dee's death from a heart condition, major developments occur when the contents of her will are revealed, affecting the other characters' lives dramatically. Upon Dee's insistence that a male heir continue her business, Stephen tracks down the young man he believes to be his long-lost son, Andy Green (Danny Roberts).\n\nEnd-of-season cliffhanger (Episode 352): David and Beryl are held at gunpoint at Woombai by escaped criminal Joe Parker. As the episode comes to an end, five gunshots ring out and a scream follows, but viewers are left with no indication of who has been shot and who will survive to the next season. Sisters Patricia and Margaret come face to face for the first time since Margaret's release from prison, and Patricia tells Barbara that her best friend Helen Green is Andy's mother. Fiona rushes to the clinic to try and stop Jill from having an abortion, but will she make it in time?\n\nAs season 3 starts, Patricia's marriage to Stephen unravels and she seeks comfort in the arms of psychiatrist Matt Kennedy while continuing her bitter feud with sister Margaret, which climaxes in the siblings being trapped in a bush fire at Woombai, and finally making their peace when Margaret saves Patricia's life.\n\nMajor changes in the cast occur with the departures of John, Stephen, Doug and Rosie Palmer, and the introduction of a fourth family in the form of the working-class O'Briens, who move in next door to the Palmers and quickly become involved in the dramas of the other characters. The Palmers experience further problems when David has an affair with Patricia's sister Margaret, which finally ends his marriage to Beryl. David's happiness with Margaret is short-lived, however, as she dies following injuries sustained in a plane crash. Lynn becomes involved with Andy Green while Kevin is working overseas, and the two fall in love, leaving Lynn confused and contemplating suicide on the edge of a cliff. Lynn eventually chooses to stay with Kevin, and they move overseas with son Davey.\n\nPatricia finds herself embroiled with shady businessman Roger Carlyle (Leslie Dayman) and his son Luke (Peter Cousens). Shortly after Luke embezzles Patricia's company, he is found murdered and Patricia becomes the prime suspect, leading to a series of attempts on her life orchestrated by Roger. Other new characters introduced during the season include Irene Fisher (Judy Nunn), a GP who opens a new boarding house with Fiona, Karen Fox (Lyndel Rowe), a deceitful businesswoman who wreaks havoc whilst having a romantic affair with Wayne, Ross Newman (Robin Stewart), a gambling-addicted surgeon, under the influence of Roger Carlyle, and Bob 'Mitch' Mitchell (Philip Quast), an ex-convict who becomes romantically involved with Amanda whilst coming to blows with Karen and Wayne.\n\nEnd-of-season cliffhanger (Episode 528): A sedated, helpless Patricia lies on a hospital operating table, about to be operated on by Dr. Ross Newman, who is working for Roger Carlyle. Fiona makes up her mind regarding Barney Adams' marriage proposal, and Mitch lies on the floor apparently dead following a confrontation with both Karen and Wayne. Has Wayne killed Mitch?\n\nSeason 4 features a major turning point with the departure of its most popular cast member, Patricia. When Rowena Wallace chose to leave, the producers attempted to replace Patricia with several strong female antagonists in the form of Karen Fox, Leigh Palmer (Lisa Crittenden) and Caroline Morrell (Abigail) but none of these proved as successful, leading the producers to bring the character of Patricia back, albeit played by former \"The Box\" star Belinda Giblin, having undergone plastic surgery in Rio de Janeiro and now calling herself Alison Carr.\n\nThe season begins with Patricia finally marrying David, before fleeing to Rio to escape Roger Carlyle. Meanwhile, Wayne is tricked by Karen into marrying her, believing she has covered up the murder of Mitch for him, unaware Mitch is not dead at all and was paid by Karen to disappear. Shortly after the truth is revealed, Karen is found dead in the creek at Dural, having been pushed off a bridge following a confrontation with escort Liz Smith, who is in love with Gordon. Beryl gives birth a baby son Robert, but he is abducted by Dr. Ross Newman, and a nurse, Gloria; then again later by Leigh. Fiona becomes involved in a bitter battle to have deceased fiancé Barney Adams' secret wartime diaries published, running into opposition from Colonel Bainbridge and his son Chris. The Colonel commits suicide and Chris sets out on a vendetta of revenge against Fiona.\n\nKaren Fox tricks Wayne into marriage after convincing him that he has killed Mitch. Wayne goes missing shortly after, worried that he will face jail for murder and whilst he is away a look-alike arrives and fools everyone into believing he is Wayne. Ian Rawlings plays dual roles as both Wayne Hamilton and Gary Evans.\nOne of the bigger storylines for the season sees a planned redevelopment threaten to destroy Woombai under the direction of the scheming Bill Ashley, although the development is a scam. When Amanda Morrell overhears a conversation that could jeopardise the entire scheme, she goes missing, leaving the Morrell family distraught and Caroline desperate to find her. Caroline begins to get closer to ex-husband Stephen and warns his new love interest Jenny Turner to stay away from him and the two become rivals.\nThe father of Leigh Palmer's baby, Richard Crampton arrives, deciding he wants custody and he hires Neil Duffy to try to buy his son from Leigh. When this fails, Crampton starts terrorising her and hires a hitman, Nick Stafford, to go after Leigh. Crampton ends up dying at Stafford's hands after David has already fired a shot at him.\nDavid and Fiona go to Rio in search of Patricia, David having received an amount of money which he believes must have come from her. Following plastic surgery to hide injuries sustained at the hands of a thug who beat her up in Rio de Janeiro, Patricia returns to Australia under a new identity; Alison Carr and she begins to start trying to clear \"her friend's\" Patricia's name for the murder of Luke Carlyle.\nMary Reynolds turns up at Woombai, lost and confused and claiming that Patricia is her mother. She explains that her grandmother told her that her mother is Patricia Hamilton. Her grandmother and grandfather are now both dead, having been murdered. Mary claims that she witnessed the murders while hiding underneath her bed. The murderer turns up at Woombai and starts gunning for Mary.\nAn old will belonging to Gordon's father is discovered, declaring his brother James as the rightful owner of Woombai. It isn't long before James arrives to claim what is his.\n\nEnd-of-season cliffhanger (Episode 696): It's a dramatic end-of-year final with numerous cliffhangers leaving lives hanging in the balance. David and Beryl look on in horror as an emotionally unbalanced Doris Hudson advances menacingly towards her baby son Robert with a pillow with intentions to smother him. Alison and James are left in peril as they race to stop Wayne from unknowingly marry his half sister Mary but their light aircraft runs out of fuel and following a mayday call it crashes to the ground . Caroline is overpowered and locked in a cupboard at the Hamilton House by Duncan Phipps after a bungled robbery and Irene breaks the news to Fiona that she has cancer.\n\nFor many fans, this season is seen as the start of the demise for the series as the focus changed and popular regular characters such as Barbara Hamilton and Irene Fisher were hastily written out of the series. In Cornelia Frances's 2003 autobiography, she states that it was not her decision to leave the series, but that of a producer, Posie Jacobs, who suddenly axed her. Other characters that failed to make it to the end of the season included Leigh Palmer, Tim Palmer, Donna Palmer, Spider Webb, Brett Keegan, Adam Tate, Samantha Morrell, James Hamilton and Mary Reynolds. Consequently, there was an influx of less well-received characters such as Janice Reid, May Walters, Craig Maxwell, Doug Fletcher, Glenn Young, Debbie Halliday, Ginny Doyle and the return of Susan Todd, played now by Oriana Panozzo.\nStorylines see Samantha Morrell shocked after running into Bill Ashley and discovering new information regarding her missing sister Amanda, but the search that follows ends with devastating news as they discover Amanda died a few months earlier having been forced into a life of drugs and prostitution.\nLeigh Palmer commits suicide early in the season, outside the court where she is facing sentencing for kidnapping baby Robert—bringing an end to one of the series longest running storylines.\nFiona meets her bossy niece Janice for the first time, arriving just as Fiona is to undergo an operation to remove her kidney and together they launch a campaign to save an old mansion house that Fiona once lived in with old friend May Walters.\nWhen an angry Caroline starts arguing with Alison whilst she is driving a car crash ensues with Barbara and Gordon's lives left at risk and ultimately leaving Barbara with serious facial scars and Gordon with amnesia believing he is still married to Patricia. Alison uses the situation to her advantage to get Barbara out of Gordon's life for good and Caroline finds herself serving time in prison.\nCraig Maxwell turns up in Sydney, looking for his mother, Ruby Hawkins, who gave him up when he was a baby, and who happens to be the exact double of Beryl Palmer. Initial misunderstandings are resolved and Craig accepts that Beryl isn't Ruby. Beryl subsequently helps Craig track Ruby down. At this point Leila Hayes plays both the roles of Beryl and Ruby.\nNed Parker and Micky Pratt hold Janice, May, Gordon and Neville hostage at the mansion, following Ned's escape from jail. Micky is killed when she walks out into the road without seeing a car heading towards her. As the siege comes to an end, Patricia's fingerprints are discovered on a gun that was used and Alison's real identity is finally revealed.\nAlison finds a little boy named Tick McCarthy at Fiona's boarding house, and passes him off as Wayne's son. Wayne is told that Tick is his son from a fling with Moya Brinkley, a girl that he had known as a teenager. He and Tick take to each other, and Wayne is angered when Alison tries to stop him from enjoying his son, due to the fact that she had said that he had driven Caroline insane because of Doug Fletcher. A birth certificate shows that Wayne is indeed the father. Susan gets upset about Tick being around, but Wayne makes certain that his son is included in his life.\n\nEnd-of-season cliffhanger (Episode 868): The season comes to an end with more multiple cliffhangers and lives at risk as Alison is trapped in the study at the Hamilton House with a venomous snake on the loose. A sailing trip on a yacht ends in disaster when both Glen and Tick are wounded, and Wayne, swimming for help, is pursued by a shark. Craig is knocked out by a horse and Caroline is shocked to discover that Doug is already married. Sadly by this point ratings were in decline and the next season would prove to be the last.\n\nDeparting characters included original member David Palmer and recent additions Ginny Doyle, Tick McCarthy and Glen Young. New additions include Nick Benson, Greg Hudson and Sarah Hudson, and in an attempt to boost flagging ratings, producers lured back Rowena Wallace, who had previously played Patricia, to play her own twin sister Pamela—a storyline which, ultimately failed to save the series.\nCaroline discovers that Susan is alive and well despite being presumed dead and she is in hiding from Wayne. When an upset Wayne gets drunk and drives off, Glen and Ginny go after him and a high-speed chase follows which leads to Glen's and Ginny's deaths. Wayne turns everyone against him and when he is shot there are no shortage of suspects. Beryl finds herself behind bars for the shooting, having realised Susan was guilty and so she lied to protect her daughter. While in prison Beryl meets Pamela, a lady who is the spitting image of Patricia. It is soon discovered that Pamela and Patricia are twins, separated at birth. While Patricia lived the good life, Pamela had a much tougher upbringing.\nAndy learns that he has a baby daughter, Madonna, who is the result of a fling with Jodie Frazer. When Jodie decides that she can't cope with bringing up a baby on her own and dumps Madonna on Janice, Andy steps in and decides to be a proper father to the girl.\nGordon goes into business with Bill Sanders, Doug and Alison at Sanders' Air Charter. Just as everything seems to be going well, a plane is sabotaged. The company appears to be falling apart until a mystery company puts up money to keep it going. Gordon discovers to his surprise that it was Wayne who was behind the rescue. Although father and son have been on opposing sides for some time, Gordon remarks that it appears that Wayne might have changed for the better. As he settles with new wife Beryl and her son, Robert in Melbourne, Gordon finds himself content.\nNick Benson is a psychiatrist brought in to help Wayne remember who shot him. Nick has a fraught relationship with his brother, Michael. Very much a ladies' man, Nick is attracted to Alison but he also finds himself attracted to sister, Pamela. There ensues a furious struggle between Alison and Pamela, using powerful mind games to try to destroy each other. Nick eventually chooses Pamela over Alison and drives off with her to begin a new life.\nDoug and Caroline marry, and Caroline is revealed as the author of a book entitled My Sister My Love, based on the lives of the Hamiltons and the Palmers, despite the changes of character names. Doug tries to stop Caroline promoting the book, warning her that they're going to lose all their friends, but Caroline ignores him. She even writes a sequel. Caroline discovers that she's pregnant, but also learns that the baby could be born with Down's Syndrome and she opts to have an abortion, later deciding that she can't go through with it. She doesn't tell Doug that she's pregnant, but instead decides to leave him and start life afresh elsewhere. Doug learns about the pregnancy, though, and he chases after Caroline and tells her that he loves her, and that he wants her to have the baby and that he doesn't care if it's handicapped, wanting them all to be together as a family. Caroline agrees and Doug buys a fish shop in Melbourne!\nCharlie meets Todd Buckley, a fitness instructor who works at her gym, and there is an instant attraction. The couple quickly announce their engagement, despite attempts by Alison to break them up. Charlie becomes so appalled at Alison's behaviour and schemes that she throws her out, leaving Alison staying in a cheap, run-down motel. Charlie enjoys a fairytale wedding to Todd and prepares to live happily ever after.\nSarah Hudson arouses Wayne's interest, and they begin to spend time together. Sarah tries to throw herself at Wayne, but he's wary after all his bad experiences with women. Meanwhile, he puts his plan into action to take everything and everyone away from Alison. With Wayne believing his wife Susan is dead, Alison decides to use Susan to get at Wayne but the plan backfires when Susan is left dead on the lounge floor at Dural, having apparently been strangled by Wayne. Realising that he's finally gone too far, he turns to the telephone and makes a call. He asks for the police. Alison faces bankruptcy but is reunited with David.\nThe show ends in a similar vein to how it began. At Fiona's mansion boarding house, a young couple arrive, and ask for a room. The young woman is heavily pregnant. Fiona takes them in, just as she had with David and Patricia all those years ago. The woman gives birth to twins, a boy and a girl and the story seems to have finally come full circle. The final episode ends with a montage of many cast members, both past and present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSeven Network aired the first episode as a 90-minute special in January 1982, during the Christmas/New Year non-ratings period, and the date of the final episode varied across Australia. There are 972 half-hour episodes, although during the series' original run, later episodes were shown in an hour-long format. No figures are available for how many of these longer episodes made up the show's run. The series was broadcast on the Seven Network, initially four days a week for half an hour at 19:00, but in later years, in two one-hour shows per week, and finally in one hour-long show per week, although this varied in different parts of Australia. \"Sons and Daughters\" became the highest-rated programme in its slot, and was the most watched Australian soap of the 1980s. The series eventually began to suffer from declining ratings, and was ultimately cancelled. During the 1990s the programme was repeated throughout Australia, usually in early-morning and daytime slots.\n\nSeven Network began another re-run in October 2006, airing weekdays at 10:00. This was discontinued in early 2007, then resumed in July 2008, airing on Wednesday nights, usually around midnight. As of October 2013, episodes air Tuesday and Thursday mornings at 3:30am. Episode 461 aired on 8 October 2013.\n\n7TWO began repeating the show on 2 November 2009, airing weekday mornings at 9:30am.

{"id": "2027283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027283", "title": "Expressionist music", "text": "Expressionist music\n\nThe term expressionism \"was probably first applied to music in 1918, especially to Schoenberg\", because like the painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866–1944) he avoided \"traditional forms of beauty\" to convey powerful feelings in his music . Theodor Adorno interprets the expressionist movement in music as seeking to \"eliminate all of traditional music's conventional elements, everything formulaically rigid\". This he sees as analogous \"to the literary ideal of the 'scream' \". As well Adorno sees expressionist music, as seeking \"the truthfulness of subjective feeling without illusions, disguises or euphemisms\". Adorno also describes it as concerned with the unconscious, and states that \"the depiction of fear lies at the centre\" of expressionist music, with dissonance predominating, so that the \"harmonious, affirmative element of art is banished\" .\n\nExpressionist music often features a high level of dissonance, extreme contrasts of dynamics, constant changing of textures, \"distorted\" melodies and harmonies, and angular melodies with wide leaps .\n\nThe three central figures of musical expressionism are Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) and his pupils, Anton Webern (1883–1945) and Alban Berg (1885–1935), the so-called Second Viennese School. Other composers that have been associated with expressionism are Ernst Krenek (1900–1991) (the Second Symphony, 1922), Paul Hindemith (1895–1963) (\"Die junge Magd\", Op. 23b, 1922, setting six poems of Georg Trakl), Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971) (\"Three Japanese Lyrics\", 1913), Alexander Scriabin (1872–1915) (late piano sonatas) . Another significant expressionist was Béla Bartók (1881–1945) in early works, written in the second decade of the 20th century, such as \"Bluebeard's Castle\" (1911) , \"The Wooden Prince\" (1917) , and \"The Miraculous Mandarin\" (1919) . American composers with a sympathetic \"urge for such intensification of expression\" who were active in the same period as Schoenberg's expressionist free atonal compositions (between 1908 and 1921) include Carl Ruggles, Dane Rudhyar, and, \"to a certain extent\", Charles Ives, whose song \"Walt Whitman\" is a particularly clear example . Important precursors of expressionism are Richard Wagner (1813–1883), Gustav Mahler (1860–1911), and Richard Strauss (1864–1949) (; ). Later composers, such as Peter Maxwell Davies (1934–2016), \"have sometimes been seen as perpetuating the Expressionism of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern\" , and Heinz Holliger's (b. 1939) most distinctive trait \"is an intensely engaged evocation of … the essentially lyric expressionism found in Schoenberg, Berg and, especially, Webern\" .\n\nMusical expressionism is closely associated with the music Arnold Schoenberg composed between 1908 and 1921, which is his period of \"free atonal\" composition, before he devised twelve-tone technique . Compositions from the same period with similar traits, particularly works by his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern, are often also included under this rubric, and the term has also been used pejoratively by musical journalists to describe any music in which the composer's attempts at personal expression overcome coherence or are merely used in opposition to traditional forms and practices . It can therefore be said to begin with Schoenberg's Second String Quartet (written 1907–08) in which each of the four movements gets progressively less tonal . The third movement is arguably atonal and the introduction to the final movement is very chromatic, arguably has no tonal centre, and features a soprano singing \"Ich fühle Luft von anderem Planeten\" (\"I feel the air of another planet\"), taken from a poem by Stefan George. This may be representative of Schoenberg entering the \"new world\" of atonality .\n\nIn 1909, Schoenberg composed the one-act 'monodrama' \"Erwartung\" (\"Expectation\"). This is a thirty-minute, highly expressionist work in which atonal music accompanies a musical drama centered around a nameless woman. Having stumbled through a disturbing forest, trying to find her lover, she reaches open countryside. She stumbles across the corpse of her lover near the house of another woman, and from that point on the drama is purely psychological: the woman denies what she sees and then worries that it was she who killed him. The plot is entirely played out from the subjective point of view of the woman, and her emotional distress is reflected in the music. The author of the libretto, , was a recently graduated medical student familiar with Freud's newly developed theories of psychoanalysis, as was Schoenberg himself .\n\nIn 1909, Schoenberg completed the \"Five Pieces for Orchestra\". These were constructed freely, based upon the subconscious will, unmediated by the conscious, anticipating the main shared ideal of the composer's relationship with the painter Wassily Kandinsky. As such, the works attempt to avoid a recognisable form, although the extent to which they achieve this is debatable.\n\nBetween 1908 and 1913, Schoenberg was also working on a musical drama, \"Die glückliche Hand\". The music is again atonal. The plot begins with an unnamed man, cowered in the centre of the stage with a beast upon his back. The man's wife has left him for another man; he is in anguish. She attempts to return to him, but in his pain he does not see her. Then, to prove himself, the man goes to a forge, and in a strangely Wagnerian scene (although not musically), forges a masterpiece, even with the other blacksmiths showing aggression towards him. The woman returns, and the man implores her to stay with him, but she kicks a rock upon him, and the final image of the act is of the man once again cowered with the beast upon his back.\n\nThis plot is highly symbolic, written as it was by Schoenberg himself, at around the time when his wife had left him for a short while for the painter Richard Gerstl. Although she had returned by the time Schoenberg began the work, their relationship was far from easy . The central forging scene is seen as representative of Schoenberg's disappointment at the negative popular reaction to his works. His desire was to create a masterpiece, as the protagonist does. Once again, Schoenberg is expressing his real life difficulties.\n\nIn around 1911, the painter Wassily Kandinsky wrote a letter to Schoenberg, which initiated a long lasting friendship and working relationship. The two artists shared a similar viewpoint, that art should express the subconscious (the \"inner necessity\") unfettered by the conscious. Kandinsky's \"Concerning The Spiritual In Art\" (1914) expounds this view. The two exchanged their own paintings with each other, and Schoenberg contributed articles to Kandinsky's publication \"Der Blaue Reiter\". This inter-disciplinary relationship is perhaps the most important relationship in musical expressionism, other than that between the members of the Second Viennese School. The inter-disciplinary nature of expressionism found an outlet in Schoenberg's paintings, encouraged by Kandinsky. An example is the self-portrait Red Gaze (see Archived link), in which the red eyes are the window to Schoenberg's subconscious.\n\nAnton Webern's music was close in style to Schoenberg's expressionism, c. 1909–13, and subsequently his music \"became increasingly constructivist on the surface and increasingly concealed its passionate expressive core\" . His \"Five Pieces for Orchestra\", Op. 10 (1911–13) are from this period.\n\nAlban Berg's contribution includes his Op. 1 Piano Sonata, and the Four Songs of Op. 2. His major contribution to musical expressionism, however, were very late examples, the operas \"Wozzeck\", composed between 1914 and 1925, and unfinished \"Lulu\" . \"Wozzeck\" is highly expressionist in subject material in that it expresses mental anguish and suffering and is not objective, presented, as it is, largely from Wozzeck's point of view, but it presents this expressionism within a cleverly constructed form. The opera is divided into three acts, the first of which serves as an exposition of characters. The second develops the plot, while the third is a series of musical variations (upon a rhythm, or a key for example). Berg unashamedly uses sonata form in one scene in the second act, describing himself how the first subject represents Marie (Wozzeck's mistress), while the second subject coincides with the entry of Wozzeck himself. This heightens the immediacy and intelligibility of the plot, but is somewhat contradictory with the ideals of Schoenberg's expressionism, which seeks to express musically the subconscious unmediated by the conscious.\n\nBerg worked on his opera \"Lulu\", from 1928 to 1935, but failed to complete the third act. According to one view, \"Musically complex and highly expressionistic in idiom, \"Lulu\" was composed entirely in the 12-tone system\"\n, but this is by no means a universally accepted interpretation. The literary basis of the opera is a pair of related plays by Frank Wedekind, whose writing is virtually a \"reversal of the expressionist aesthetic\", because of its complete indifference to the characters' psychological states of mind, and portrayal of characters whose \"personalities have little or no basis in reality and whose distortions are not the product of psychological tension\" . The plainly evident emotion of Berg's music is dislocated from its cause and \"deflected onto something else impossible to define\", thereby contradicting its own intensity and undermining the listener's \"instinctive obedience to emotive instructions\", contrary to expressionism, which \"tells its listeners pretty unambiguously how to react\" . In contrast to the plainly expressionist manner of \"Wozzeck\", therefore, \"Lulu\" is closer to the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) of the 1920s, and to Bertolt Brecht's epic theatre .\n\nIndeed, by the time \"Wozzeck\" was performed in 1925, Schoenberg had introduced his twelve-tone technique to his pupils, representing the end of his expressionist period (in 1923) and roughly the beginning of his twelve-tone period.\n\nAs can be seen, Arnold Schoenberg was a central figure in musical expressionism, although Berg, Webern, and Bartók did also contribute significantly, along with various other composers.\n\n\n"}

The base was built by the United States Army Air Forces in 1941 under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement with the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom its establishment in 1941 until March 31, 1949, the base was located in the Dominion of Newfoundland. On March 31, 1949, the Dominion of Newfoundland was admitted to Canadian Confederation and became the 10th province of Canada. The agreement enabling the base's existence, from 1941 until closure in 1966, enabled it to function as a \"de facto\" enclave of United States territory within, first the Dominion of Newfoundland and later Canada, making United States military personnel stationed at the base subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nFollowing its closure in 1966, the base property was relinquished by the Government of the United States to the Government of Canada, under the terms of the original deal. The Government of Canada subsequently transferred the base property to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, which established the Harmon Corporation to oversee the disposition and use of the base property and facilities.\n\nThe airfield is now operated as Stephenville International Airport while many of the base's support buildings and housing have been incorporated into the town of Stephenville.\nDuring 1940, Germany was threatening the majority of Europe, as well as North America, through its successful air, land and sea campaigns. The destructiveness of the Luftwaffe (air force) and Kriegsmarine (navy) in the Battle of Britain and Battle of the Atlantic alarmed military planners in the United States who theorized that the Nazis could in future establish a beachhead on the island of Newfoundland and the adjacent French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon and use it for launching air attacks and eventually land and sea attacks on the industrial heartland of North America.\n\nIn 1940, the United States entered into the Destroyers for Bases deal with the government of the United Kingdom, allowing the US military to establish facilities in British Overseas Territories in the Western Hemisphere. The primary focus for North American defence from Nazi aggression was Newfoundland, which the United States sought to arm as a geographic buffer much as it was doing with its Alaska territory to defend North America against Imperial Japan in the northwest.\n\nThe United States established an administrative army air force and coast defense base named Fort Pepperrell (no airfield) in St. John's, along with a deepwater naval base and naval aviation field at Argentia on the Avalon Peninsula. The northeast coast of Newfoundland and the strategically important Strait of Belle Isle were left exposed, therefore military planners sought to establish an army air force base on of land at the northeast end of Bay St. George near the coastal hamlet of Stephenville. The 76th Congress approved the 99-year lease and in April 1941, construction began on a deepwater port and adjacent air field.\n\nDuring the war a battery of two 155 mm coast defense guns was at the base, due to its coastal location. It was called Battery T8503 and was operated by Coast Artillery Corps troops of the Harbor Defenses of Argentia and St. John's.\n\nThe air force base was originally referred to as Stephenville Air Base. On September 1, 1943, the Newfoundland Base Command transferred control of the Stephenville Air Base to the North Atlantic Wing, Air Transport Command. The base was actively used throughout the war and was one of the largest U.S. military airfields located outside of the continental United States; it was capable of landing the largest cargo aircraft in the world at that time and the base became a frequent stopping and refueling point for USAAF aircraft crossing the Atlantic. Stephenville Air Base was renamed \"Ernest Harmon Air Force Base\" on June 23, 1948, in honor of Captain Ernest Emery Harmon. Capt Harmon was a U.S. Army Air Corps pilot who was killed in an air crash in 1933. The deepwater port which supported the base was named Port Harmon at this time.\n\nErnest Harmon AFB was transferred to Northeast Air Command in October 1950. The 6605th Air Base Wing served as the host unit at the base. In April 1957, with the rising threat of nuclear war, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) assumed control of the base for use as a forward refuelling point. The 6605th Wing was superseded by the 4081st Strategic Wing. Ernest Harmon AFB became home to a fleet of KC-97 Stratofreighter air refueling aircraft, which were kept on alert in order to meet and refuel nuclear armed B-52 Stratofortress bombers in the skies over western Newfoundland. The base also saw use as a refueling stop for transatlantic military flights and the base supported three Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) units. On the 16 September 1951 a bulldozer accidentally destroyed of 51 pair telephone cable before construction began on the new runway. Restoration of telephone service was completed 48 hours later. Base Communications personnel laid the cable and the splicing and repair was done by the Avalon Telephone Company of Newfoundland. The cable was buried 25–30 feet below the new\nrunway. In 1957, the Canadian Department of Transport constructed an airport terminal to accommodate Trans-Canada Air Lines (now Air Canada) commercial flights; Ernest Harmon AFB being the only air field in western Newfoundland.\n\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as USAAF Aerodrome - Stephenville, Newfoundland at with a variation of 30 degrees west and elevation of . The field was listed as \"All hard surfaced\" and had three runways listed as follows:\n! Runway Name\n\nThe Cold War expansion of the base in the early 1950s coincided with the Korean War and the rise in nuclear tensions with the Soviet Union. The USAF sought to build more roads in the area to serve the base and nearby Pinetree Line early warning radar site and to patrol the immediate area for security; the roads would also act as a means of dispersing personnel in an emergency. One of the more important projects was a bypass road around the base, known as the Hansen Memorial Highway.\n\nIn 1953, the 347th (Engineer Aviation) battalion was assigned the immense task (along with 2,502 contractor personnel) of completing the 62 line construction projects at Ernest Harmon AFB. These consisted of:\n\nBy June 1953 the 347th Engineers had deployed 444 engineers. They were joined by an additional 750 engineers who departed Florida and arrived at Harmon on June 23 to construct three of the line construction projects:\n\nThe 347th Engineers was made up of four companies; three line companies and one Headquarters and Service (H&S) company. Company A was responsible for construction of the salvage yard and Company B and C were responsible for the construction of the bypass road with a budget of $583,000.\n\nThe salvage yard, which was situated near Noels Pond on , was finished to partial occupancy by the fall of 1954 and completed in 1955. Thirty Butler Buildings (prefabricated steel) were located on the property. The machinery which constructed the bypass road was buried at the end of the property when it became over used and obsolete in 1959/1960, under the supervision of Warrant Officer Ebb Higdon, Company A. They were later dug up to be sold for scrap but were found to be useless and reburied. This equipment had come up from Florida in Liberty ships, with the battalion in 1953. In 1986, when this information was made available to the town of Stephenville via a series of articles in the \"Georgian\" newspaper, several doubters and curiosity seekers, armed with metal detectors, swarmed over the site and located the buried equipment.\n\nCompany B and C began work on the bypass road by working towards each other. Company C, under the command of Captain Claxton Ray began at the Stephenville side and worked towards Company B which began construction near Cormiers Village and worked in two directions towards Long Gull Pond and towards Stephenville. It was necessary to begin construction of the road at Cormiers Village and work back towards Stephenville pending the finalizing of property agreements. Company B was under the command of Captain Gomez. The H&S Company split operations equipment and men between the three Companies.\n\nThe long construction began with a line of corduroy roads comprising one half of the road and when Long Gull Pond was reached in the fall of 1954, the other half was constructed. The road followed the existing rail road line. It was necessary to build three access roads approximately in length in order to facilitate construction of the bypass road. These roads were built to the same specifications as the bypass road as they were used constantly for heavy hauling. The concrete bridge over Cold Creek was built in 1954 and the concrete bridge over Warm Creek was programmed for completion in 1956. Not counting equipment, of fill. of crushed rock and of earth were used before the final of paving was laid down. Equipment and material were stored at the Gull Pond site. The bypass road was officially opened to the public in October 1957 and named the Hanson Memorial Highway. The third construction operation was cancelled.\n\nThe 347th (changed to the 823rd in 1954) Engineer Aviation Battalion was disbanded in 1957 and most of the men went back to the US. The two battalion commanders at the time were, Colonel Germain and Major Truet. The medical officer was V.H. Berry and the ground safety officer was 1st Lieutenant Arthur Everitt. The general construction on the base (buildings, roads and runways) was done under the base supervision of Colonel Koski and Colonel Bailey. J.A. Jones held the construction contract from 1954 to 1959. From 1956 to 1959, Major Ray was the superintendent for the asphalt, rock crushing and concrete operations for J.A. Jones and was responsible for the construction of 200 on base houses, two seven-story barracks for 1,500 airmen, additional runways and the Central Heating (steam) Plant. Colonel Koski died in 1989 and Lieutenant Colonel Ray died on New Year's Eve, 1989. One of the barracks is now used as residences for the College of the North Atlantic as well as a hotel during the summer tourist season. The other barrack was converted into a 6-story apartment complex known as the Stephenville Manor.\n\nThe first educational institution in the Bay St. George area was established by the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop John T. Mullock established the first church at Sandy Point in 1848 when the population of the area numbered approximately 2,000. Local priest Father Sears established a church in the coastal community of Stephenville and by 1884 there were four Catholic schools in the parish. One at Sandy Point, one at the Highlands, one at Port aux Basques and one at Campbell's Creek.\n\nProtestant schools were subsequently established in the St. George's Bay area as settlements grew. Newfoundland and Labrador maintained their separate denominational schools until the late 1990s. The huge influx of US military personnel and their families to the region required separate schools and a curriculum approved by the US Air Force. Such cultural and institutional changes were revolutionary for Newfoundland at that time, however the development of education facilities would take many years.\n\nThe first educational institution at Ernest Harmon AFB was an elementary school established in 1948 using a small clap-board building that housed 28 children and 3 teachers. The first high school graduating class (1957) matriculated in 1953 with all of the students beginning their educations at St. Stephens High School in Stephenville. A new elementary school was built near the base entrance in 1955 and was formally opened in May 1956 by former base commander, Colonel Richard Fellows and the school principal, Mr. Gerald Brennan. In 1956 there were 19 teachers and 62 children.\n\nOn September 4, 1956 the base high school officially opened in building number T-394, the old elementary school building. In 1958, the same year that Stephenville received its first traffic light and television celebrated its first birthday, Harmon High established its own newspaper, \"The Harmon Highlight\". In June 1960 the elementary school was located to a building with large play areas for the children. There were 29 elementary teachers and Mrs. Anna Barnett was the secretary. Joseph C. McCormack was the high school principal in 1961 and Mr. Harvey Bodiford was the superintendent of both Harmon and Goose Bay US military schools with his main office at Goose Bay.\n\nIn 1961 Cecil Haddox was promoted to superintendent of schools at Ernest Harmon AFB and he was also appointed principal of the junior-senior high schools. Mr. Haddox had previously taught at Pepperrell AFB from 1957-1960 before being transferred to Harmon that year. In 1961 several new programs were started due to his perseverance and the National Honor Society was formed as well as several new classes such as art, music and physical education.\n\nThe base's civilian dependent population continued to grow during the early 1960s and the schools expanded along with them. A new high school (now being used by Newfoundland and Labrador's community college, the College of the North Atlantic) was opened and in 1962/63, the high school teaching staff increased to 25 while the elementary-middle school staff of teachers jumped to 42.\n\nBy 1965/66, the last year of military operations at Ernest Harmon AFB, the total school population had now grown to over 1000 elementary students and 38 teachers and the high school had a population of 171 junior high and 235 high school students with 28 teachers. When the base closed in 1966, so did the school system, which had 1,175 elementary students and 43 teachers and 405 junior and high school students and 26 teachers upon closure.\n\nStaff Sergeant Jack Prekup formed the first Boy Scout troop on the base and had lots of priority events because of the \"brass\" liking Scouting. Scouting was quite active in the elementary and high school levels. Trips were made to Corner Brook, Fox Lake, Indian Head, the Port au Port Peninsula, Kippens, the Humber River to fish for Atlantic salmon, and other locations. Boy Scouts became Lone Scouts after leaving the base if they so desired, in other communities. Ed Zeidler and Sergeant Henry Erben were the last Scoutmasters. Sergeant Erben was the Troop 6 survival trainer and had worked with the first seven US astronauts in survival techniques.\n\nStephenville Air Base and later Ernest Harmon AFB was quite an isolated posting during its early years as a United States Army Air Forces and later United States Air Force base. It was located in the protection of the Long Range Mountains and harbour of the St. Georges Bay area, virtually cut off from rest of the island, except for a few roads and boat and plane traffic. Newfoundland itself was, and still is, considered isolated. But during the 1940s and 1950s, when roads were virtually non-existent and surface travel was limited to the slow narrow-gauge passenger trains of the Newfoundland Railway which linked to small coastal steamships or ferries to the mainland at North Sydney, Nova Scotia, the sense of isolation could prove overwhelming. In addition, the airfield's location at the head of Bay St. George was one of the more geographically isolated parts of the island, being surrounded by the Long Range Mountains and the coastline of the island's west coast being dotted with tiny outports. In addition to USAAF/USAF aircraft, the only other option for travel was the railway and ferries/coasters, or exploring the limited local road network which stretched along the coast and into the uninhabited interior of the island.\n\nDespite its early isolation, morale on the base was high. The base also precipitated an economic boom of sorts on Newfoundland's southwest coast during the 1940s. Corner Brook to the north had been considered the major population centre for the region, given its industrial base, harbour, and nearby recreational opportunities in the Humber Valley. With the investment of the USAAF in Stephenville, the St. George's Bay area began to flourish and grew rapidly. The village of Stephenville grew from a hamlet of several hundred people with no paved streets, side walks, water or sewage system in 1941 into a modern town of over 5,000 by the mid-1950s. By the time Ernest Harmon AFB closed in the mid-1960s, the town had more than doubled in size, partly as a result of the provincial government's forced resettlement policy toward residents of outports.\n\nRecognizing the link between geographic and social isolation, the base command incorporated a number of recreational facilities into their programs and building projects, making Ernest Harmon AFB a leader of sorts among USAF facilities. By the mid-1950s, thousands of service men and their families were making use of these activities monthly. In the area of Hobby Shops there was space available for leather craft, ceramics, amateur radio, lapidary, woodworking, automotive shops, model airplanes and photo labs. Sports facilities and groups were set for softball, baseball, bowling, golf, picnicking, archery and guns. The Stephenville area was located near good hunting and fishing grounds, thus the base established a fishing lodge at Camp 33 with eight large cabins, a 40-man bunk house, along with a mess hall and kitchen. Camp 33 was owned by the Bowater Pulp and Paper Company which had a mill in Corner Brook, although the camp was leased to the base during the spring and summer months.\n\nAlong with outside activities a number of service clubs were built and the University of Maryland University College extension courses were set up for those wishing to continue their education while on the base. A local broadcasting station and commercial free radio station was in operation by the mid-1950s with as many as six live shows a week being broadcast as well as live theater and plays being made available and a movie theater. A large gymnasium was built in 1956 with a seating capacity of 500, two squash courts and four wall courts. The base chapel accommodated up to 1500 worshippers of many religions and faiths per week. The library was also one of the most frequently used facilities with an average book lending rate of 1000 books every month. The most popular recreational feature of the entire base was the Base Theater which ran a new movie every night except Sundays and Mondays. There were four shows a day and a matinee on Saturdays.\n\nGiven its size and importance, and the large number of personnel assigned during the height of the Cold War in the 1950s, the base managed to attract many celebrities to visit and/or perform, including Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope. In the early years of the base, recreational activities off base in the town of Stephenville were very limited and some were often restricted. In some of the pamphlets released by the base to its airmen, they went as far as giving the names of women and particular houses and taverns that no base personnel were to be in or near, as well as rules about fraternizing with the local girls.\n\nThe Hanson Memorial Highway bypass project resulted in what has been referred to as the \"Fight for Long Gull Pond\". During the bypass road construction activities of 1953/54 the 347th Engineer Aviation Battalion used the beach area of Long Gull Pond as a storage yard for their equipment while they were building the road. The bypass road or Hanson Memorial Highway as it was later to be called, ran along the same route as the narrow gauge branch rail line from the base to the Newfoundland Railway main line at White's Siding, east of Stephenville Crossing.\n\nIn June 1953 one of the officers overseeing construction, Captain Claxton Ray, took it upon himself to discover the ownership of a tract of land encircling the head of the lake nearest the rail line. It was listed on their maps as being part of Reid Lot 21.\n\nThe only means of access to Long Gull Pond was by the military rail line from Ernest Harmon AFB to White's Siding, or by walking for through the rugged terrain. The construction of the bypass road continued through the summer of 1955 and there still was no evidence of the ownership history behind Reid Lot 21. The engineers had been dealing with the woods manager at Bowater's Pulp & Paper Limited, Mr Cyril Parsons, concerning land acquisition rights along the right of way of the bypass road. Major Ray (since promoted) was informed that Bowater owned the parcel of land in question and that they would entertain the idea of selling it for two purposes only: agriculture or tourist development.\n\nOn July 19, 1955 an application to purchase the site was considered by Bowater and they informed the US military that the sale had been approved with one clause added \"...you will be required to resell to the company the land which you are now acquiring at its original purchase price [$20 per acre (4,900/km²)] together with the cost of any improvements which you may have made, should you desire to sell the property within a period of ten years\".\n\nIn 1956 Major Ray made preparations to be relieved from active duty with the engineers as of April 30. He returned to Stephenville as a civilian wishing to engage in private enterprise and drew up plans for a tourist development on the Long Gull Pond site. What he had proposed for the site was a 55-room hotel with motel units, a dining room, swimming pool, skating rink and services for hunters and fishermen on the long lake. Bowater leased of surrounding land for the recreation venture, reserving the timber rights for themselves. Because the road construction was incomplete at this time and winter was setting in, the actual purchase transaction did not take place until May 16, 1957. The bypass road was still under construction and was not completed until the fall with opening ceremonies taking place in October.\n\nDuring the summer of 1957, rumors were abounding in the town of Stephenville that an American had purchased property with a great potential to the area. \"The Western Star\" in Corner Brook had printed a report on a chamber of commerce meeting where it was proposed that since Stephenville had used the Long Gull Pond site for a park for many years, that it should be acquired for recreational purposes under the Provincial Parks Act before individuals gobbled it up for their own profits. Bowater was placed in an embarrassing position: they had sold Canadian land to a foreigner, before the local population realized they had lost a valuable piece of property.\n\nMajor Ray realized that Stephenville had neither the funds nor the coordinated efforts required to construct a park in the Long Gull Pond area. Stephenville had over $40,000 in water and sewage bills due at the time and these had not been collected. The town (outside the base) had only one paved street and the others were inadequately lighted, snow removal was inadequate during the winter, there was no water filtration plant at this time and the only local police force was a local Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment. With all this in mind, Major Ray made an announcement in The Western Star (reference cited) on August 20, 1958:\n\nIn the Fall of 1958, Mr. W.J. Keough, Minister of Mines and Resources stated that there was no chance, at the present time for the provincial or municipal governments to purchase any property near Stephenville for a park. The Indian Head Rod and Gun Club went ahead that same year with construction of buildings on property bordering Major Ray's, which they had leased from Bowater.\n\nThe controversy died after Major Ray didn't develop the Bowater-leased property on the lake as a resort, instead allowing public access to the property until it was sold to the Indian Head Rod and Gun Club in 1987. Ray had turned his efforts to other ventures and in August 1953 he had received permission from the United States and Canadian governments and the town of Stephenville to construct and operate a trailer park as off-base housing for Ernest Harmon AFB servicemen. He built and serviced 46, lots on of land along Queen St. In 1956, Ray, along with Telesphore White, created another 50 lots on . Mr White bought the property in 1965 for $20,000. In 1956, Ray began the first coin-operated laundromat and dry cleaners in Newfoundland (one of only five in Canada at the time), as well as a flower shop. He lived on the base until 1965 and raised a family with his wife, Gay, a teacher at the Harmon Elementary School.\n\n\n\nRecords in possession of one of the editors of this article, pertaining to: Lt.

It was published posthumously in 1904.\n\nSterne wrote it in the summer of 1767 as he neared the end of his life. At that time he was also writing \"A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy\", where the 'little picture of Eliza' that Yorick wears around his neck is mentioned at the outset.\n\nThe journal is in the form of a diary-cum-letter and was inspired by his deep affection for Mrs. Elizabeth Draper whom he had met when she visited England in 1765-1767. She was the 22 year old wife of an East India Company official and sister of Rawson Hart Boddam. Her husband had brought her to recuperate from illness. Given both parties were already married, the relationship was regarded as scandalous.\n\nThe author adopts the pseudonym Parson Yorick, who previously appeared in his two best known novels, \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" and \"A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy\". In \"Tristram Shandy\" we are told that the parson is related to the famous, fictional jester Yorick whose skull is disinterred in Shakespeare’s \"Hamlet:\"\n\n\"It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other than that of the king’s chief Jester;—and that Hamlet’s Yorick, in our Shakespear, many of whose plays, you know, are founded upon authenticated facts,—was certainly the very man.\"\n\nIn a second example of the author's playfulness with names, Sterne and Eliza receive the pet names ‘Bramin’ and ‘Bramine’ throughout. Given the Brahmin Hindu priestly caste is renowned for austerity and wisdom, Sterne thereby draws attention to his real-life role as a priest. Simultaneously, Eliza's epithet Bramine highlights her connections with India.\n\nThis playful religious name-calling serves to remind us that Sterne was an Anglican clergyman. Remembered now for his fiction, in his day more copies of his Sermons were published than of his novels.\n\nThere is characteristically Sternian ambiguity in the Journal concerning whether it was written as a private extended love letter to Elizabeth Draper, or was intended for publication as literature. It appears to be both autobiographical and an imaginative work of fiction, and Sterne says he is writing for posterity:\n\n\"...when You and I are at rest for ever— Some Annotator or explainer of my works in this place will take occasion, to speak of the Friendship which Subsisted so long and faithfully betwixt Yorick and the Lady he speaks of.\"\n"}

The film was nominated for Best Documentary at the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards.\n\nIn 1978, Ron Hyatt (now Ron Jeremy) was a teacher who dreamed of some day becoming an actor. One day his girlfriend sent his nude photo to \"Playgirl\" magazine, who published the picture as part of their \"Boy Next Door\" feature. Later he was asked to star in a hardcore pornographic film, which he accepted; this would become starting point of his pornographic career.

The 225th reading of its original male branch was held in 2011. A female branch of Episkopon has been active since 1899, holding their 182nd Reading in 2019. Prominent alumni of the Episkopon include Former Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill Graham, filmmaker Atom Egoyan, and Former Canadian Governor General Adrienne Clarkson. The organization is one of the oldest collegiate secret societies in North America and the oldest in Canada.\n\nThe male and female branches both present three annual Readings during which they publicly satirize the goings-on about college through a wide range of jokes, songs, and poems delivered by the branch's leader, the Scribe. The society's mythological premise is to deliver \"gentle chastisement\" on behalf of the Venerable Father (or Mother) Episkopon, a spirit who supposedly resides at Trinity and who is represented at Readings by a human skull. Described in the media as a \"self-perpetuating board of directors\", the clandestine group of former Scribes and their assisting editors style themselves as the Order of the Golden Key. The motto of the organization is from Horace: \"Notandi Sunt Tibi Mores\" (Latin: \"The manners of men are to be carefully observed\").\n\nIn 1992, Episkopon was censured and forcibly disassociated by the Trinity College Council following allegations of racism and homophobia. Despite policies prohibiting Episkopon from engaging in any activities on College property, the society has nevertheless continues to play an important role in undergraduate life at Trinity. The Episkopon continues a steady membership of Trinity College students and holds regular events away from Trinity College property.\n\nEpiskopon has existed since 1858, when it was announced that the first Scribe was Pakenham Edward Stewart, later an Anglican priest. Episkopon began as a student newspaper, developed into a form in which only one copy of each edition was created, to be read aloud by the Scribe. Episkopon provides insight into College history, through the keeping of archives dating back to 1879. A poster by artist Roloff Beny advertising a Reading from 1945 is in possession of the National Archives of Canada. Also in the National Archives is a film about the former Trinity College campus on Queen Street West, made by Gordon Sparling, in which Episkopon's traditions feature prominently. A board listing the names of female Scribes once hung in Trinity's St. Hilda's College, but was removed upon the group's decision to disassociate from the College, a show of solidarity with the male branch in the 1990s.\n\nOne attempted student suicide was allegedly linked to a 1985 reading, although the circumstances of the connection were not reported, and were later refuted by a CBC radio investigation. In October 1991, following accusations of racism, sexism, and homophobia in Episkopon, a task force was formed to investigate it and Trinity College at large. When the male Scribe of the 1992-1993 academic year refused to draft a constitution that was consistent with the task force's recommendations, the Trinity College Council voted unanimously to sever all ties with the organization. Investigative journalist Declan Hill, a Trinity alumnus, in a 1993 documentary broadcast on the CBC Radio program \"Ideas\", claimed that Episkopon's Readings tended to ridicule certain groups and actions as a form of social control. The article cited student objections to the singling out of individuals for public shaming. In 2008, a prospective male member of Episkopon sustained head injuries when he tripped and fell down a hill during an initiation ritual. In recent years, both branches have made efforts to break away from harmful past trends. These efforts have been successful, with both organizations largely avoiding controversy over the past decade.\n"}

The group consisted of Pete Gas, Rodney, and Joey Abs. The Posse's gimmick was that they were friends of Shane McMahon from the \"mean streets\" of Greenwich, Connecticut, and were from a similarly upper class background. This was emphasized by their attire of sweater vests and dress pants.\n\nGas and Rodney were legitimate school friends of Shane McMahon, whereas Joey Abs was already a professional wrestler who was brought in to be the 'worker' of the group. The Posse was closely allied with Shane McMahon, often helping him defend the European Championship throughout early 1999. At the beginning, the group also featured two other members named Willie Green and Billy P. It is unknown as to why they were pulled from the group, and who portrayed them remains largely unknown also. They were only ever featured in sporadic backstage segments and in the crowd for WrestleMania XV. The new three membered Posse attempted to help McMahon defeat Test at SummerSlam, but were unsuccessful. After they turned on Shane, the Posse were relegated to being enhancement talents, losing to teams such as the Dudley Boyz, The Holly Cousins and Too Cool. Despite this, Gas would manage to briefly hold the Hardcore Championship. At WrestleMania 2000, all three members of the Posse would briefly win the Hardcore Title. They then began a short-lived program with Edge and Christian, in which the Posse was hired to steal the Tag Team Championship from the Hardy Boyz. On the October 8, 2000 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\", Gas and Rodney faced the Hardy Boyz for the title, but they were unsuccessful. Abs was then involved in a short-lived storyline with Stephanie McMahon, where it was revealed that they were ex-lovers.\n\nIn 2000, the entire Posse was moved to Memphis Championship Wrestling, a developmental territory of the WWF. While in MCW, the Posse managed to win several titles before being released from their contracts in June 2001. On December 10, 2007, \"Raw\" held its 15th-anniversary special and Gas represented the Posse in a 15th Anniversary Battle Royal, where he was subsequently eliminated by Bart Gunn.\n\nIn 2009, WWE.com interviewed the Posse as a part of the website's \"Where are They Now?\" feature. All three members have since retired from wrestling, as Gas now works for W.B. Mason, an office supply company, Rodney owns his own landscape management company in Glen Ridge, New Jersey and Abs works in his family's car repair shop.\n\nPete Gas released his autobiography Looking at the Lights: My Path from Fan to a Wrestling Heel in 2017.

The population is (2013).\n\nThe municipality contains the large beach resorts of Maspalomas, including Playa del Inglés and San Agustín, and the Pilancones natural park. The municipal capital, the village of San Bartolomé de Tirajana is situated in the mountains, from the coast and south-west of Las Palmas, at about elevation. Most of the population lives along the Atlantic coastline. The GC-1 motorway passes through the southern part of the municipality, and connects it with Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and the Gran Canaria Airport.\n\nLocated in the south of the island, 54.5 kilometers from the island's capital, the municipality has a triangular shape with a vertex in the interior and a wide base that covers a good part of the southern coast of Gran Canaria.\n\nWith an area of 333.13 km², it is the largest municipality on the island, covering more than a fifth of the island's surface area.\n\nThe municipal capital, the rural nucleus of Tunte, is located at 850 meters above sea level, reaching the maximum municipal level at 1,957.3 meters above sea level at the elevation known as Morro de la Agujereada.\n\nThe centre of the coast of the municipality is characterised by its long and wide golden sand beaches, as well as the dune field of Maspalomas and its brackish water pool.

{"id": "2027406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027406", "title": "Festa Junina", "text": "Festa Junina\n\nFestas Juninas (, \"June Festivals\"), also known as festas de São João for their part in celebrating the nativity of St. John the Baptist (June 24), are the annual Brazilian celebrations adapted from European Midsummer that take place in the southern midwinter. These festivities, which were introduced by the Portuguese during the colonial period (1500–1822), are celebrated during the month of June nationwide. The festival is mainly celebrated on the eves of the Catholic solemnities of Saint Anthony, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Peter.\n\nSince Northeastern Brazil is largely arid or semi-arid, these festivals not only coincide with the end of the rainy seasons of most states in the northeast, but they also provide people with an opportunity to give thanks to Saint John for the rain. They also celebrate rural life and feature typical clothing, food, and dance (particularly quadrilha, which is similar to square dancing).\nVarious aspects of the festival originate from the European Midsummer celebrations, such as the creation of a large bonfire. Many of these celebrations now occur with influence from Brazilian rural society. The festivities usually take place in an \"arraial\", a huge tent made of raw material (with a thatched roof) that was reserved for important parties in older Brazilian rural areas. As the Brazilian climate differs greatly from Europe, Brazilian participants would often use the festival as a way to show gratitude for rain. The creation of a large fire, known as a fogueira, is lit during the festival. This originates from a Catholic story of a fire being lit to warn Mary about the birth of St. John the Baptist, and thus to have her assistance after childbirth, Elizabeth would have to light a fire on a hill.\n\nMost festivals occurred away from the coast line, closer to the interior where many larger plantations were. While still ruled by Portugal, coastline cities, in Pernambuco especially, became industrialized and saw much greater economic prosperity. Hoping to further this growth, King Dom João modified his economic policy to favor cities such as Recife rather than rural interests. Though the Festa Junina continued, its practice in modern cities became much larger. Today, the sizes of the celebrations have surpassed that of Europe. Although they are primarily practiced and hosted by schools, many cities host their own major celebration. In Caruaru, Pernambuco, a celebration of the festival in 2011 saw approximately 1.5 million attendees, earning a Guinness Book World Record for having the largest celebration of the festival in the world.\n\nIn Brazil, the festival is primarily practiced by rural farmers, known as caipiras. Men dress up as farm boys with large straw hats and women wear pigtails, freckles, painted gap teeth and red-checkered dresses.\n\nDances throughout the festival surround \"quadrilha\". Most of these dances emerge from 19th-century Europe, which were brought by the Portuguese. The \"\"quadrilha\"\" features couple formations around a mock wedding whose bride and groom are the central focus of the dance. This reflects the fertility of the land. There are various types of dance within the category of quadrilha, all including a heterosexual couple as the primary characters. Cana-Verde, a subcategory of fandango dance styles, are more popular in the south and are primarily improvised. Dances involving Bumba Meu Boi are also present during this festival. Here, the dance revolves around a woman desiring to eat the tongue of an ox. Her husband kills the ox, to the dismay of the ox's owner. A healer enters and resuscitates the ox, and all participants celebrate.\n\nAccompanying these dances is a genre of music known as Forró. This traditional genre primarily uses accordions and triangles, and focuses on the life and struggle of caipiras. The music greatly focuses on saudade, a feeling of nostalgia or forlorn, for rural farm life. More modern versions of the music can include guitars, fiddles, and drums.\n\nMany games targeted at children are present at Festa Juninas, especially at festivals hosted in schools serving as a fundraiser.\n\n\nWinners of these games are often given miscellaneous prizes.\n\nToday, São João festivities are extremely popular in Brazil's largest cities. The presence of a festival celebrating rural life in an urban setting has revealed modern stereotypes of caipiras. Those residing in larger cities believe rural farmers to be less educated and unable to properly socialize. This is often reflected in caricatures of caipiras taught to children in Brazilian schools, who are told to use incorrect grammar and act foolish during the festival. Anxieties over the changing meaning of the festival also reflect a growing \"carnavalization\" of the tradition. Rather than an emphasis on religion, the festival is presented as a massive gathering for both Brazilians and tourists with large concerts in major cities.\n\n\n"}

Upon the death of Hamilton East's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), George Septimus Rennie in 1931, Mitchell was approached to run in the by-election to fill the seat as a Labour candidate. Hamilton East was a strong working class riding that had elected Labour candidates to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and to city council.\n\nThe Liberals, in opposition having lost the previous year's general election did not run a candidate against Mitchell in order to avoid dividing the anti-Conservative vote. Given future events, it is also possible the Liberals believed that Mitchell would support the Liberal Party unofficially if elected.\n\nMitchell won the by-election, and entered the House of Commons of Canada. He did not get along well with the rump of Independent Labour MPs led informally by J.S. Woodsworth and referred to as the \"Ginger Group\". While Mitchell attended the \"founding meeting\" of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in William Irvine's office, he refused to join the new party when Labour MPs joined with farmers groups, socialist groups and others to officially launch the CCF in 1932 and refused to work with its supporters in Parliament.\n\nIn the 1935 general election, the CCF ran a candidate against Mitchell in Hamilton East (while the Liberals, again, ran no candidate). The split in the labour and anti-Tory vote resulted in the Conservative candidate defeating Mitchell despite the nationwide trend against the Conservatives.\n\nMitchell did not run in the 1940 election, however, following the death of Welland's Liberal MP in late 1941, Mitchell was appointed to the Cabinet of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Minister of Labour, and was elected shortly thereafter as the new Liberal MP for Welland. He served as Welland's MP and as Labour minister in the governments of King and Louis St. Laurent until his death in 1950.\n\nMitchell became Labour minister just over a year after the introduction of unemployment insurance in Canada, and oversaw the early implementation and expansion of the program. He also oversaw the mobilization of the labour force during World War II, and the widespread introduction of women into war production.\n\nWith the responsibilities his department had for immigration, he also had a controversial role in advocating and implementing the deportation or detention of tens of thousands of Japanese Canadians during the war.\n"}

He was born at Hirschberg in Silesia, became a mining official at Breslau in 1794, and in 1800 was appointed assessor to the department of mines and chemist to the royal porcelain factory at Berlin, where he died. He is known for introducing the term \"stoichiometry\".\n\nTo him belongs the merit of carrying out some of the earliest determinations of the quantities by weight in which acids saturate bases and bases acids, and of arriving at the conception that those amounts of different bases which can saturate the same quantity of a particular acid are equivalent to each other (see \"Titration\").\n\nHe was thus led to conclude that chemistry is a branch of applied mathematics and to endeavour to trace a law according to which the quantities of different bases required to saturate a given acid formed an arithmetical progression, and the quantities of acids saturating a given base a geometric progression.\n\nEvidence for the existence of atoms was the law of definite proportions proposed by him in 1792. Richter found that the ratio by weight of the compounds consumed in a chemical reaction was always the same. It took 615 parts by weight of magnesia (MgO), for example, to neutralize 1000 parts by weight of sulfuric acid. From his data, Ernst Gottfried Fischer calculated in 1802 the first table of chemical equivalents, taking sulphuric acid as the standard with the figure 1000. When Joseph Proust reported his work on the constant composition of chemical compounds, the time was ripe for the reinvention of an atomic theory. The law of definite proportions and constant composition do not prove that atoms exist, but they are difficult to explain without assuming that chemical compounds are formed when atoms combine in constant proportions.\n\nHis results were published in \"Der Stochiometrie oder Messkunst chemischer Elemente\" (1792–1794), and \"Über die neueren Gegenstände in der Chemie\" (1792–1802), but it was long before they were properly appreciated, or he himself accorded due credit for them. \nThis was partly because some of his work was wrongly ascribed to Carl Wenzel by Jons Berzelius through a mistake which was only corrected in 1841 by Henri Hess, professor of chemistry at St. Petersburg, and author of the laws of constant heat-sums and of thermoneutrality.\n\nBetween 1792 and 1794 he published a three-volume summary of his work on the law of definite proportions. In this book Richter introduced the term stoichiometry, which he defined as the \"art of chemical measurements, which has to deal with the laws according to which substances unite to form chemical compounds\".\n\nRichter was fascinated with the role of mathematics in chemistry. Unfortunately his writing style has been described as \"obscure and clumsy\". His work therefore had little impact until 1802, when it was summarized by Ernst Gottfried Fischer in terms of tables.\n\n"}

The bridge, that connected Rozelle to Pyrmont by road, is one of the last remaining swing bridges of its type in Australia and in the world. It was designed by Percy Allan and built from 1899 to 1903 by Bridges Branch of NSW Public Works Department. It is also known as RMS Bridge No. 61. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 29 November 2013 and was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate on 19 April 1989.\n\nSydney was declared a city in 1842 and was concentrated in the area currently occupied by the modern CBD. In the mid-1800s, it was a mix of commerce, retail, residences, manufacturing works and factories, with the Botanic Gardens and Domain to the east, port activities to the west and north and road outlets at its southern border leading to the inner western suburbs via the Parramatta Road, which was also the beginning of the Great Western Highway. By mid-century, it had become clear that a shorter route out of the city was available, across Johnstons Bay to the Glebe Island and on to Annandale.\n\nThe first Glebe Island Bridge was a private toll-bridge completed in 1862 and was a timber beam viaduct with a small, one arm, hand-cranked swing-span tucked into the Pyrmont shore. After 30 years, this bridge was in need of extensive repairs and the Colonial Government purchased the structure and the Public Works Department (PWD) began planning a replacement bridge. Work on the new Pyrmont Bridge and the bridge across Black Wattle Swamp shortened the travel distance to the inner west suburbs making it easier for produce to be conveyed to the city. A previously un-used part of Johnston's Bay was promoted as the site for a larger abattoir than the others previously used around the closer areas of high water. The new abattoir, to be opened in January 1860, was provided a punt system to cross the short distance to Pyrmont. Work commenced on the first Glebe Island bridge in 1860; and the first bridge opened for traffic in 1861.\n\nThe construction of the second bridge related also to a project commenced in the 1880s for the Five Bridges Route, to facilitate traffic flow from the city to the northern and western suburbs of the expanding city. Bridges were to be built or replaced at Pyrmont Bay, Glebe Island, Iron Cove, Gladesville and Fig Tree (until these bridges were built, the only access to the northern shore of the Harbour was by boat, punt or by road via Parramatta). For this project, the (old) Pyrmont Bridge and the (old) Glebe Island Bridge were purchased from their private owners and new bridges were built at Gladesville (1881), Iron Cove (1882) and Fig Tree (1885).\n\nThese completed, attention turned to replacement of the Pyrmont and Glebe Island Bridges. \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" reported in September 1890:\n\"The Departmental Board appointed by the Minister for Public Works nearly a year ago to consider the desirability of constructing new bridges to replace the present Pyrmont and Glebe Island bridges ... has now furnished the Minister with a lengthy report on the subject. The Board has decided in favour of the construction of a new bridge adjoining the present Pyrmont Bridge. The structure recommended is an iron or steel superstructure on cast-iron cylinders, with a roadway 12ft, in width, and two 12ft. footpaths. ...With regard to the Glebe Island Bridge, the Board recommended the construction of a bridge close to the present one, of a character similar to the proposed Pyrmont Bridge, at a cost of .\"\nAn international design competition for a new \"Pyrmont Bridge\" was called in 1891. The Department of Public Works submitted a non-conforming design based upon a much larger bridge than specified in the design brief.\n\nPrizes were awarded but no designs were selected and the proposal was deferred, largely owing to the economic downturn of the early 1890s but also owing to different opinions regarding the best approach. The Chief Engineer for Harbour and Rivers, C. W. Darley, favoured the construction of a new bridge - the Chief Engineer for Roads and Bridges, Robert Hickson, favoured the reclamation of Darling Harbour as far north as Bathurst Street and no replacement for the Pyrmont Bridge at all.\n\nIn 1894 the proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Public Works (the Public Works Committee) and, reporting in June, the Committee favoured no particular scheme but recommended that, when renewal of Pyrmont and Glebe Island bridges became advisable, they should be replaced by timber structures.\n\nOn 21 November 1894 the Public Works Committee (reformed in the interim under a new government) recommended that Pyrmont Bridge be replaced by a timber bridge with steel swing-span, to cost , and that Glebe Island Bridge did not require renewal. No funds were allocated, though and no action resulted. By 1897, however, the Committee had reconsidered its stance and recommended the replacement of the old Glebe Island Bridge with a stone causeway and a bridge with a steel swing-span, at a cost of . Parliament voted the funding for these works in 1898 and detailed design work commenced in the Public Works Drawing Offices.\n\nDesign of the bridges was led by Percy Allan, who had been appointed Engineer-in-Chief for bridge design in 1896. His assistant engineer was Ernest de Burgh and the junior engineers were H. H. Dare, J. J. Bradfield and J. W. Roberts, all of whom went on to have distinguished careers in public works engineering. Bradfield had charge of the team responsible for the substructure, foundations, abutments and retaining walls for both bridges. Tenders for the construction of both bridges (separate contracts) were invited in March 1899.\n\nFor both sites, Allan designed an electrically-operated swing bridge, the earliest use of electrical power for this purpose in Australia. The bridges were considered very innovative at the time of their construction and attracted international attention. For the Glebe Island Bridge, the large pivot pier was founded on a nest of timber piles capped by concrete, whereas the Pyrmont pivot pier was founded on rock.\n\nConstruction commenced on the Glebe Island Bridge and Pyrmont Bridge at the same time but Glebe Island involved more extensive (and time-consuming) land resumptions, extensive waterfront reclamation and the construction of an elevated causeway across Glebe Island. Over of mud was dredged to establish the causeway and the fill was obtained by cutting down what was left of the hillock of Glebe Island, producing of flat land for railway yards and of deepwater frontage for wharfage. In August 1899 a large load of ballast being placed for the causeway to the new bridge slipped sideways and crushed the piles of the old bridge, rendering it unfit for anything but pedestrian traffic for the following two weeks.\n\nConstruction of the trussed swing spans at each site was by simple cantilevering out from the steel pivot ring. Where timber trusses were used for the approaches of the Pyrmont Bridge, the Glebe Island Bridge used two steel deck trusses, then stone-faced embankments to reach each shore. The use of steel trusses for the approach spans had been part of Allan's original design for the Pyrmont Bridge but the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works directed that this material be replaced with timber, presumably as a cost-cutting measure. When Glebe Island Bridge was built, Allan's original specification was reinstated (perhaps owing to the use of built-up embankments and shorter approach spans, providing a more economical outcome).\n\nThe contractor for construction was H. McKenzie and Sons and the bridge was opened on 1 July 1903 by Miss Lily See, daughter of Premier, Sir John See. It was opened the year after the opening of the new Pyrmont Bridge over Darling Harbour, which has a similar design. The bridge was designed by Percy Allan of the New South Wales Public Works Department who also designed the Pyrmont Bridge. During normal operation the two swing spans rotated about a central vertical axis.\n\nThe Glebe Island Bridge operated from 1903 to 1995 with little interruption and few major works, apart from maintenance, being undertaken. In 1933, the bridge underwent an underwater upgrade, with underpinning to replace decayed piles around the central pier. In 1961, the DC electricity supply from the Tramways system was shut down, as was the tramway system in Sydney. A new AC supply was obtained from the local reticulated network and a set of rectifiers was installed in a small kiosk erected on the north east side of the bridge. In the 1980s, the Control Cabin was burnt out and was subsequently rebuilt to the original design.\n\nIn 1995 the bridge was decommissioned being made redundant with opening of the adjacent Anzac Bridge, and remains in a permanently open position with no access to pedestrians or vehicular traffic. The bridge was operated and used for access by cyclists in the annual Spring Cycle in October until 2008.\n\nOn 18 April 1989 the bridge was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.\n\nA 2009 structural assessment found the bridge in \"very poor condition\" and in April 2013 a new report found that it had deteriorated further. City of Sydney Council and the community groups lobbied the state government to restore the structure and reopen the bridge for pedestrian and cyclists. A cost–benefit report by ACIL Allen consultants for Transport for NSW on options for the bridge was released in September 2013. In 2015, it was suggested the bridge could be reused to extend the Sydney Light Rail as part of the White Bay redevelopment.\n\nThe Glebe Island Bridge over Johnstons Bay is an electrically-operated, low-level, steel central swing-span road bridge. The central swing-span is supported by a massive pivot pier, founded on a nest of timber piles capped by concrete, on which it can rotate through ninety degrees to allow passage of maritime traffic. The approach spans are two steel deck on stone-faced piers and stone-lined abutments. The bridge includes constructed embankments on both sides of its western approach.\n\nThe bridge has an approach span at each end of , two main spans of and an overall length of . The roadway is wide between kerbs and has a wide footway on each side. The central pivot in the waterway is protected by an extensive ring of timber piles. The swing span is mounted on a steel roller track on the cylindrical stone masonry and concrete pivot pier ( high and wide) and is swung by means of a 600 volt motor.\n\nTraffic was controlled by lights and a pair of timber swing-gates on either end which were electronically interlocked to ensure that the bridge cannot open until the gates are closed.\n\nThe bridge includes a rare surviving operable Mercury-arc Rectifier, as well as some early silicon rectifiers, installed in 1960 when the reticulated DC supply was discontinued.\n\nBoth Pyrmont and Glebe Island Bridges were electrically operated and could swing in 44 seconds, much faster than contemporary bridges in the world. Pyrmont Bridge, also designed by Percy Allen, has more numerous fixed spans of timber than Glebe Island Bridge where they are of steel supplemented by stone causeways. The swing-span of Glebe Island Bridge is smaller than that of Pyrmont.\n\nHigh quality Pyrmont yellowblock sandstone is thought to be used for dimension stone and Pyrmont coloured sandstone on the abutment facing and causeway fill.\n\nAs at 24 April 2013, the Glebe Island Bridge was in good condition in December 1995. The ensuing years have seen little maintenance and the bridge has been left with the swing span in the open position. It is believed to now require extensive catch-up maintenance and repairs. The Glebe Island Bridge remains generally intact and in the form it was when closed to traffic on 3 December 1995.\n\n\nNo other modifications apart from upgrades to traffic signals and signage.\n\nAlthough superseded in operation as a Main Road bridge by the Anzac Bridge, the Glebe Island Bridge remains operable, with both approach roads open and available for future use. Many Australian heritage bridges such as the Pyrmont Bridge have been adapted for pedestrian and cycle use. Today Pyrmont Bridge serves as a strategic link to the CBD despite initial attempts to demolish the structure as part of the Darling Harbour redevelopment in the late 1980s. Similarly, its twin possesses equal value as a strategic transport link from Glebe Island to the city. The Glebe Island Bridge's role as one of the five bridges route to the north west will once again become critical with the urban renewal of the Bays Precinct.\n\nAs at 23 April 2013, the Glebe Island Bridge, across Johnstons Bay, is of state significance as it demonstrates one of the earliest examples of an electric-powered swing bridge in Australia. Technically, it is a complementary structure to the already acclaimed Pyrmont Swing Bridge, and has all the same significant features, including the electrically-driven swing span. Both bridges were designed by Percy Allan, a highly regarded Australian bridge designer of the late 19th and early 20th century. Both represent the only examples of such types of bridges in New South Wales and are still operable.\n\nGlebe Island Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 29 November 2013 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nGlebe Island Bridge has historic significance at the state level as it demonstrates one of the earliest examples of an electrical powered bridge of its type in Australia. The Glebe Island Bridge, along with Pyrmont Bridge, both designed by Percy Allan at the turn of the century were innovative in their day and attracted worldwide engineering interest, with Allan invited to present a paper on the design of its older twin, the Pyrmont Bridge, to the Institution of Civil Engineers in London in 1907.\n\nThe Glebe Island Bridge has been an important item of infrastructure in the history of Sydney, Australia's famous harbour city and the capital of New South Wales, for over 90 years. The bridge was a vital component of the \"five bridges\" route from the city to the northern and western suburbs. The history of this crossing, going back to 1892, is closely associated with the economic and social development of Sydney at the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\n\nGlebe Island Bridge is of state significance for its close associations with Percy Allan (1861-1930), a highly regarded Australian bridge designer of the late 19th and early 20th century. Percy Allan was responsible for the introduction of American timber bridge practice to NSW, and designed over 500 bridges in NSW. The bridge is also associated with JJC Bradfield (1867-1943), later known for his work on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nIt is associated with the NSW Department of Public Works, a highly regarded, prolific and historically significant organisation in the history of NSW.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nGlebe Island Bridge is of state significance as its design and construction represented a significant technical achievement in the era that it was built. The bridge's innovative design included: the size of the swing span and speed of operation; development of steel bridge truss; caisson construction; design of the swing span bearing; and use of electric power.\n\nThe design of the Glebe Island Bridge represents the pinnacle of nineteenth century engineering and material technology, prior to the development of locally produced modern steel.\n\nAesthetically, the bridge is an impressive structure, sited in the middle of a wide and busy waterway, giving it landmark qualities that are apparent from numerous vantage points around Sydney Harbour.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe Glebe Island Bridge is valued by the Sydney community for its significant contribution to the social and commercial development of Sydney and the inner western suburbs, as demonstrated by the public statements and interest in its conservation demonstrated in the broad-ranging community consultation undertaken for the Bays Precinct by the NSW Government.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe bridge is a fine example of late nineteenth and early twentieth century technology, and is almost completely in original condition. The combined structural, mechanical and electrical efficiency of the bridge established it as an epitome of well designed bridge building of the time.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nGlebe Island Bridge is of state significance as it is one of only two examples of an electrically-operated steel swing bridge in New South Wales.\n\nIt is the second oldest (after its older twin, the Pyrmont Bridge) surviving bridge across a Sydney Harbour waterway. The two bridges remain the only large, electrically-operated swing spans in Australia.\n\nThe Bridge includes a rare surviving, operable Mercury-arc Rectifier, as well as some early silicon rectifiers, both of which were important early electrical technologies which have been superseded by solid-state technology. Mercury arc rectifiers are now rare outside of museum situations and only a very few remain in their original context in Australia.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nGlebe Island Bridge is of state significance as it features all the significant structural and technical features of a swing-span bridge.\n\nIt is an excellent example of one of the various types of opening bridges, which are the economical solution to constructing road bridges across navigable waterways, where high-level bridges are possible but unaffordable. Opening bridges have been a crucial factor in the economic development of NSW since the late nineteenth century, with its high-level of industrialisation but relatively low population levels on an international scale.\n\n\n"}

He played in forty nine Tests for England taking 174 wickets at 25.58 each.\n\nLock took 2,844 first-class wickets, placing him ninth on the all-time list, and is the only player to score more than 10,000 runs without once making a century; despite passing fifty on 27 occasions, his highest score was 89, made in a Test in Guyana. His tally of 831 catches in first-class cricket, mostly taken at short leg, lies behind only W.G. Grace and Frank Woolley.\n\nBorn in Limpsfield, Surrey, Tony Lock had the weighty backing of HDG Leveson Gower and made his first-class debut for Surrey County Cricket Club at just seventeen years and eight days old on 13 July 1946, which made him the youngest ever to play for the county. However he did not play regularly until 1949. In 1951 he took 105 wickets, and broke the 100-wicket barrier every year up to and including 1962, on two occasions (1955 and 1957) claiming more than 200 victims.\n\nLock made his England debut in the third Test against India in 1952, and played the fourth and fifth Tests against Australia the following summer; he had in fact been picked for the first game, but had worn his spinning finger raw after being named in the team and had had to withdraw while it healed. However, England regained the Ashes and for his efforts Lock was named one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1954 edition of Wisden's Almanack. However, he also had to deal with accusations (not entirely unfounded) that he was a 'chucker', being called for throwing on more than one occasion. This was one of the grudges that many had against him, the other was his consistent Test selection over Johnny Wardle of Yorkshire.\n\nIn 1956, Lock was famously the bowler who took \"the other wicket\" when Jim Laker achieved his world-record 19–90 at Old Trafford against Australia, and two years later had an extraordinary summer of success against an admittedly poor New Zealand side, finishing with 34 wickets at an average of a mere 7.47. He was inconsistent abroad, however, failing completely on the 1958/59 tour of Australia, but again terrorising the New Zealanders in the same winter, with 13 wickets at under nine runs apiece. It was during the New Zealand leg of the tour that he saw himself on film. Shocked by what he saw, he remodelled his action. By 1961, he was back in the Test side against Australia.\n\nDropped for the 1962-63 Ashes series he played with great success for Western Australia, returning to play for that state each winter for the rest of his career.\n\nLock moved to Leicestershire in 1965, and was made captain for the following two seasons, taking the club to second place in the County Championship in 1967. In 1967/68 he was unexpectedly recalled by England because of an injury to Fred Titmus, and played in the last two Tests against West Indies. He was the last man called up to play for England who was not playing for a first-class county. Though not achieving any great success with the ball, he contributed to the cause in another way, by making his highest first-class score of 89 in the first innings of the final Test at Georgetown, Guyana. England had nine wickets down when the game (played over six days) finished, and claimed the series 1–0.\n\nLock's remaining playing career was spent entirely with Western Australia, and fittingly his last first-class wicket was that of an Australian Test player, Paul Sheahan.\n\nAfter retirement he moved into coaching in Perth and London, but late in life faced two separate charges of sexual abuse. In December 1993 he was found not guilty by a 10–2 majority that he had, in 1987, indecently assaulted a fifteen-year-old girl after inviting her to his home for a bowling lesson. The following day he was charged with four counts of indecent assault on a girl aged under thirteen.\n\nHe was again cleared, but the experience affected him badly. He died from cancer in his adopted home town of Perth at the age of 65.\n"}

{"id": "2027535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027535", "title": "Joseph Oleskiw", "text": "Joseph Oleskiw\n\nDr. Joseph Oleskiw or Jósef Olesków ( \"Osyp Oleskiv\", September 28, 1860 – October 18, 1903) was a Ukrainian professor of agronomy who promoted Ukrainian immigration to the Canadian prairies. His efforts helped encourage the initial wave of settlers which began the Ukrainian Canadian community.\n\nJoseph Oleskiw was born in the village of Nova Skvariava (Nowa Skwarzawa), near Zhovkva, in the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia (now western Ukraine.) His father, a Greek (Eastern) Catholic parish priest, was a member of the rural élite. Oleskiw studied geography and agriculture at the University of Lemberg (Lviv, Ukraine). He was appointed professor of agronomy at the teacher's college in Lemberg.\n\nUkrainian immigrants who had traveled to Brazil and Argentina, enticed by the free transportation they had received, sent back word that conditions there were worse than in their homeland. After hearing of the struggles of Ukrainian immigrants in Brazil, Oleskiw investigated alternative choices. He determined that the Canadian prairies were the most suitable for the Ukrainian farmers. This led to Oleskiw writing two pamphlets in Ukrainian – \"On Free Lands\" (\"Pro Vilni Zemli\", spring 1895), and \"On Emigration\" (\"O emigratsiy\", December 1895) – and one in Polish. Oleskiw sought and obtained the endorsement of the Prosvita Society that a non-commercial, non-profit effort to help the immigrants should be implemented.\n\nOleskiw left for Canada along with Ivan Dorundiak, a representative of the farming community, on July 25, 1895 on a fact-finding journey that would span three months. Along the way, at length he met with Sir Charles Tupper, at that time Canada's High Commissioner in London. The correspondence between Oleskiw and the Canadian Government was conducted with the aid of the High Commissioner in London. Because of Oleskiw's efforts, on the one hand, and the Canadian government's direct involvement, on the other, the flow of Ukrainians to Canada was much more targeted and organized than that to the United States.\n\nOn August 12, 1895, they arrived in Montreal. On reaching Winnipeg, Oleskiw met with H.H. Smith, Commissioner of Dominion Lands, who assigned Hugo Carstens, who spoke German, to act as an interpreter and guide for Oleskiw and Dorundiak's tour of Western Canada. Oleskiw was particularly interested in the area of Stony Plain, District of Alberta, due west of Edmonton, where a number of German settlements had been started. In the region of Beaverhill Creek, northeast of Edmonton, he encountered 16 Ukrainian families who had recently taken up homesteads. Following an inspection of Vancouver Island, he returned to Winnipeg and then traveled to Ottawa via the United States.\n\nOleskiw believed in selective emigration. His first group of settlers were thirty hand-picked families, led by his brother Vladymir (\"Volodymyr\"), who arrived in Canada in Quebec City on April 30, 1896. The majority of these immigrants settled in Edna, District of Alberta, northeast of Edmonton.\n\nLater that summer, seventeen Oleskiw families led by Cyril Genik, and nine who had left on their own from Bukovyna, also settled in Manitoba in the Stuartburn district. The first representatives of the intelligentsia – Cyril (Kyrylo) Genik, Ivan Bodrug, and Ivan Negrich – guided contingents of Dr. Oleskiw's settlers to Canada in 1896 and 1897. Genik preferred Stuartburn, a district not recommended by Oleskiw; as it was close to the large Mennonite settlement near Gretna, and commercial farms in North Dakota and Minnesota, where those Ukrainians who needed cash might earn some extra money. Fifteen families from Galicia settled in an area recommended by Oleskiw, northwest of Dauphin, Manitoba. As the Riding Mountains resembled the Carpathian foothills, some families also found their way into this area.\n\nThus began the massive, continuous influx of Ukrainian immigration to Canada. Due in part to the widespread distribution of Oleskiw's literature, Ukrainians became the largest Slavic group in Canada, with a population of at least 170,000 by August 1914. Although Oleskiw promoted emigrants based on their assimilationist tendencies, the mass of Ukrainians that followed them tended to retain their cultural heritage.\n\nOleskiw was married twice and had two sons and two daughters from his first marriage. In 1900 Olesków was appointed principal of a teacher's college in Sokal. The departure from Lemberg, political pressure and the death of his first wife led him to withdraw from emigration promotion after his move. Three years after the appointment to Sokal, he died suddenly at the age of 43.\n\nOleskiw's accomplishments in organizing Ukrainian immigration to Canada were threefold. First, he diverted to Canada thousands of Ukrainians destined for Brazil. Second, in attempting to regulate the number of peasants leaving Western Ukraine in any given year, he tried to prevent Galician land prices from falling drastically; though in this he was only partially successful. Third, in organizing the immigrants’ journey, he sought not only to prevent exploitation by unscrupulous officials and ticket agents but to secure the Canadian government's co-operation in the early stages of immigration.\n\nToday Oleskiw Park and the Oleskiw neighbourhood in Edmonton, Alberta are named after him.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located about 130 km north of Kolkata within Nadia district, West Bengal, India. Along with Nabadwip, it is considered a spiritual place by the adherents of Sanatana Dharma, also known as Hinduism.\n\nThe word \"Mayapur\" derives from \"Minyapur\" (Bengali: \"মিঞাপুর\") [Miñāpura], the Bengali name of a villages, Known as Muslim inhabited village, specially for the settlement of Muslim fishermen.\n\nIt is said to be the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The headquarters of ISKCON is situated in Mayapur. It is said that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu appeared along with his brother Lord Nityananda, commonly known as Nitai. Nityananda is the incarnation of Lord Balarama. These two brothers appeared just for the fallen conditioned souls of this Kali-yuga to bestow on them the greatest blessings of Harinama Sankirtan based on the teachings of Bhagvad Gita and Shrimad Bhagavatam. Along with their associates, the Pancha Tattva, they distributed the divine Love of Godhead to anyone and everyone without seeing any qualifications or disqualifications. Mayapur is where the Material and Spiritual Worlds meet. Just as there is no difference between Lord Chaitanya and Lord Krishna, similarly there is no difference between Shridham Mayapur and Vrindavan.\n\nThe main attraction in Mayapur is Srila Prabhupada's Pushpa Samadhi Mandir, a memorial to ISKCON's founder. The main shrine is surrounded by a museum depicting Srila Prabhupada's life, using fiberglass exhibits. In 2002, the International Society of Krishna Consciousness was planning to construct a garden in memory of George Harrison. Another must-visit is the Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir. This temple has 3 main altars, Sri Sri Radha Madhava, Panca-tattva and Lord Narasimha Deva. These Pancha Tattva deities are the largest deities of Pancha tattva in the world. The Panca-tattva comprises Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Nityananda Prabhu, Advaita Acharya, Gadadhara Pandit, and Srivas Thakur.\n\nThere are a number of Gaudiya Vaishnava organizations in Mayapur, such as the Gaudiya Math. The town is heavily centered on this particular Vaishnava religious tradition, officially known as the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya, with temples devoted to Radha and Krishna or Gaura-Nitai throughout.\n\nThe Gaudiya-Vaishnava devotees every year circumambulate the various places of Lord Chaitanya's pastimes in the group of nine islands known as \"Navdvip\".

Frequently cast in the role of villain, Drago's films included Clint Eastwood's western \"Pale Rider\" and Brian De Palma's \"The Untouchables\". He also had recurring roles in the television series \"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\" and \"Charmed\".\n\nBurrows was born in Hugoton, Kansas, the son of William Franklin Burrows Jr, and Gladys Marie Wilcox (1917–1993) on November 30, 1945. He took his grandmother's maiden name as his stage name to keep from being confused with another actor. Growing up, his parents would drop him off at the movie theater often in their rural town.\n\nAfter leaving high school he started out as a journalist for the Associated Press, and later became a popular voice on radio that took him first to Canada then to New York City. After a brief stint with a touring theater group, he worked as a stuntman at Boot Hill in Dodge City, Kansas. From there he went on to the University of Kansas. After finishing college, he joined an acting company.\n\nDrago began his acting career in 1979. His early films included \"No Other Love\", \"Windwalker\" and the Jeff Bridges vehicle \"Cutter's Way\". He went on to guest star in numerous television series, including: \"Hill Street Blues\", \"Moonlighting\", \"Walker Texas Ranger\" and \"Trapper John, M.D.\".\n\nThe role that brought his career international prominence was as the gangster assassin Frank Nitti in Brian De Palma's 1987 blockbuster cinema film \"The Untouchables\". Subsequently, Drago appeared in numerous films and television roles; the latter list included \"The X-Files\" and a recurring role in \"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\"\n\nIn 1999 he played the demon Barbas in the WB series \"Charmed\". His character was supposed to appear in only one episode, but due to popularity with fans he was brought back for six additional episodes, appearing in five of the show's eight seasons.\n\nHis film resume includes \"\", \"\", and \"Pale Rider\". He also was featured in Michael Jackson's 2001 music video \"You Rock My World\".

In 1858 it was described as a \"green chile pepper stuffed with minced meat and coated with eggs\".\n\nIn current cuisine, it is typically stuffed with melted cheese, such as queso Chihuahua or queso Oaxaca or with picadillo meat made of diced pork, raisins and nuts, seasoned with canella; covered in an egg white batter, simply corn masa flour and fried, or without any batter at all. Although it is often served in a tomato sauce, the sauces can vary.\n\nSome versions in Mexico use rehydrated dry chiles such as anchos or pasillas.\n\nIn the United States, chiles rellenos are usually filled with asadero or Monterey Jack cheese, but can also be found with cheddar or other cheeses, as well as ground or minced meat. Typically the chile is then dipped in an egg white batter and either pan-fried or deep-fried. Chiles rellenos are a popular cuisine in the U.S. state of New Mexico, where the Hatch chile is revered for its slender (rather than round) shape and medium-to-hot flavor. In the contiguous U.S., rellenos are typically served with red or green chile sauce or mole.\n\nVariations, which can be seen based on regional tastes or experimentation, include:\n\nA recipe from 1914 (as \"chili reinas\") is published in a period guidebook to San Francisco restaurants.\n\nIn Guatemala, the pimiento pepper is stuffed with shredded pork and vegetables.

The name is pronounced \"Boogie Boy\"—the strange spelling \"Booji\" resulted when the band was using Letraset to produce captions for a film, and ran out of the letter \"g\". When the \"i\" was added but before the \"e,\" Devo's lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh reportedly remarked that the odd spelling \"looked right.\"\n\nBooji Boy has traits of a simian child and typically wears an orange nuclear protection suit. He is portrayed by Mothersbaugh in a mask and is the son of another fictitious Devo character, General Boy. The intent of the figure is to satirize infantile regression in Western culture, a quality Devo enjoyed elucidating. This character was officially introduced in the 1976 short film \"The Truth About De-Evolution\".\n\nAccording to the book \"We're All Devo!\", the roots of the character come from discovering a baby mask in an Akron area novelty store. Mothersbaugh developed the character's distinctive high pitched falsetto almost instantly. He had kept a supply of Booji Boy masks for several years, but due to improper storage, many of them ended up ruined from dry rot. A similar, half-head mask was used in concerts during 2004 and 2005, and a new mask based on the original was created and used beginning in 2007. In 2012, SikRik Masks in Devo's hometown of Akron, Ohio made a new mask that more closely resembled the original. The company made 100 copies of the new mask, which were sold through Club Devo.\n\nBooji Boy was incorporated into Devo's 1996 PC CD-ROM video game \"Adventures of the Smart Patrol.\" His name was simplified to \"Boogie Boy\" and the game claims his \"real name\" was \"Craig Allan Rothwell.\" Not coincidentally, this is also supposedly the real name of the dancer known as \"Spazz Attack\" who appeared in some of Devo's videos and played Booji Boy on a Devo tour.\n\nThe game's booklet contained more information about the character's back story:\n\nBooji Boy has been featured in the band's visual imagery throughout their career. For example, he plays a prominent role in the video of their 1981 single \"Beautiful World.\" He also appeared in the 1982 Neil Young film \"Human Highway\" in a very comical yet unsettling role predicting the end of the planet. Booji is pictured on the cover art to Recombo DNA. Booji Boy publicly announced his pending resignation on multiple occasions, most recently on August 13, 2007, yet he appeared at a Summerfest concert on July 4, 2010 and on July 8, 2010 at the Town Ballroom in Buffalo, New York. Booji Boy continues to appear in concert regularly to perform \"Beautiful World.\" In recent years, Booji Boy's concert appearances have seen him dressed in modern \"hip hop\" attire (including a sideways ball cap and sporting \"bling\"), with Devo bass guitarist Gerald Casale introducing him as \"Boogie Boyyyyyy.\"\n\nBeyond Devo's works, Booji appeared in the Zabagabee home video by Barnes & Barnes demonstrating how to masturbate, and in the music video for \"You Ain't Fresh\" by hip hop duo Boogie Boys.\n\n\"Booji Boy\" was also the name of the independent label Devo used to record their earliest songs. The following vinyl releases were sold under the Booji Boy banner:\n\nIn 2012, the label was reactivated for archival releases by the band.\n\nMothersbaugh, as Booji Boy, wrote a book entitled \"My Struggle\". The title is the English translation of Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" and the book featured a red leather cover as a poke at Chairman Mao Zedong's \"little red book\". Excerpts from the book can also be found hidden in Devo's CD-ROM game \"Adventures of the Smart Patrol.\"\n\nBooji Boy primarily performs live, but his voice was used on several early Devo recordings, such as \"Lost At Home (Tater Tot)\" and an early version of \"Smart Patrol.\" His only album appearances are the song \"Puppet Boy\" from \"Shout\", Devo's cover of \"Bread and Butter\" by The Newbeats and a re-recorded vocal track to the early demo \"U Got Me Bugged,\" which appears on the soundtrack to \"Adventures of the Smart Patrol\" (performed by Pat Tierney instead of Mark Mothersbaugh).\n\nIn concert, Booji has performed several songs:\n\n\n"}

With a summit roughly above sea level, it is the second highest point in Fermanagh, the highest being at Cuilcagh on the Northern Ireland–Republic of Ireland border in the south of the county. The historian John O Donovan (1834) states that the indigenous population called the mountain Bel Mor Muintir Pheodachain .\n\nBelmore Mountain dominates the skyline in the nearby county town of Enniskillen and gives its name to Belmore Street.\n\nGeologically dominated by limestone, outcropping of the sedimentary rock forms extensive sheer cliffs near the summit. Chemical erosion caused by the natural acidity of water has formed a cave system underneath the mountain, accessible at the village of Boho. Faulting has produced the Knockmore escarpment on the western flanks of Belmore. Other small villages and hamlets around the foot of Belmore include Letterbreen and Springfield.\n\nAgriculture is limited due to the steep slopes and thin peaty soils on Belmore, however extensive plantations of coniferous forest can be found on the upper plateau.\n\nIn 1894, archeologist Thomas Plunkett excavated both the Eagle’s Knoll Cairn passage tomb and Moylehid ring cairn in the townland of Moylehid; one of which is situated on an eastern spur of Belmore Mountain overlooking the Erne valley.\n\nThe mountain also gives its name to an Irish earldom. Somerset Lowry-Corry, 4th Earl Belmore, served from 1868 to 1872 as the 14th Governor of New South Wales, where several features are named for him: the Belmore River, the suburb of Belmore in Sydney, Belmore Park, also in Sydney and in Goulburn.

The show aired in the 7:30 p.m. (ET) time slot following repeats of \"The Jack Benny Program\" {\"The Best Of Benny\"} on Sundays. The show was produced by Pete Barnum.\n\nDespite its short run, the show contained some running gags and stock jokes, from Freberg's ambivalence toward Madison Avenue (faux advertisements for \"Puffed Grass\" and \"Food,\" as well as the sketch \"Gray Flannel Hatful of Teenage Werewolves\") to the interviews with a sneaker-wearing Abominable Snowman. Freberg also developed an elaborate parody of Lawrence Welk's then-current \"Dodge Dancing Party\", which he later released (in a somewhat shorter form) as a single, \"Wun'erful, Wun'erful! (Sides uh-one & uh-two).\" (He would reprise the Welk impersonation for his final show, in which the fictional Welk tersely mocks Freberg's cancellation.) \n\nBy the thirteenth episode, it was clear that \"The Stan Freberg Show\" was suffering from a lack of advertiser interest (perhaps helped by Freberg's werewolf comparisons). According to Freberg's autobiography, \"It Only Hurts When I Laugh\", two different cigarette companies offered to sponsor the program, but Stan turned them down; because no other advertisers were willing to provide primary or alternate sponsorship on Freberg's terms, CBS canceled the series after fifteen episodes. According to author Joe Bevilacqua, it was the last American network radio show to devote itself purely to comedy.\n\n"}

Alabina consists of lead singer Ishtar, who does the female vocals, and the band Los Niños de Sara, who provide male vocals and music.\n\nAlthough the name of the group is often written Alabína, the accent on the \"i\" is unnecessary. The mistake may be attributed to the group's use of the font Papyrus on its album covers. In this font, dotted i's look as though they carry accents.\n\nAccording to Alabina.org, the word is Arabic and Alabina has two meanings: \"let's go\" and \"God is between us.\" The name comes from the title of Alabina's first song. It is also the name of the group's first album.\n\nAlabina consists of lead singer Ishtar, who does the female vocals, and the band Los Niños de Sara, who provide male vocals and music.\n\nIshtar was born and raised in Israel. Her parents are Jewish from Moroccan and Egyptian descent. She speaks and sings in Arabic, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and English; she also says she \"half-speaks\" \"Moroccan.\" Ishtar began performing in clubs at age 15 and continued even in the Israeli army, where she served as a helicopter technician. Though she was born Eti Zak, she chose the name \"Ishtar,\" a Mesopotamian goddess, because her grandmother called her Ester, which \"with her Egyptian accent it sounded like Ishtar,\" she said.\n\nAs the lead singer of Alabina, Ishtar frequently sings in Arabic, complementing the Spanish of Los Niños de Sara. She often sings Arabic-style, with a wavering voice and trilling. She also sings Hebrew songs, sometimes songs from her childhood, only alone, however — not with Alabina. Occasionally she joins Los Niños in Spanish. On her own, she frequently sings French. Nine out of twelve songs in her album \"The Voice of Alabina\" are in French — and she has two songs in English: \"C'Est La Vie My Baby\" (\"Truly (Emet)\") and \"Last Kiss\" (\"The Voice of Alabina\").\n\nIshtar is frequently featured on Alabina album covers. She has dyed blond hair, which is sometimes curly, and dark brown eyes. She has been noted for her provocative dress in pictures and at concerts.\n\nOn her own, Ishtar has produced three albums: \"The Voice of Alabina\" (2000), \"Truly (Emet)\" (2003) and \"Je sais d'où je viens\" (2005). The first is mainly composed of French songs, the second is mostly in Hebrew, and Ishtar's last album is primarily in Arabic, with four songs in French, one in Spanish and significant chunks of English dispersed throughout.\n\nIshtar currently lives in France but has also a home located at the city of Eilat in Israel.\n\nLos Niños de Sara (in Spanish, \"Sara's children\") are Spanish-speaking Gypsies from Montpellier, France. The four cousins are named Antonio (\"Tonio\") (also written Antoine) Contreras, Ramón Compas, Santiago (\"Santi\") Lorente, and Coco. Though they speak both Spanish and French, they only sing in their native Spanish. Tonio, the lead male singer, plays guitar. In addition to all providing back-up vocals, Ramón and Santi play guitar and Coco plays percussion.\n\nOn their own, Los Niños have produced two CDs: \"La Cubanita\" (2001) and \"Gipsyolé\" (2003). Their songs often speak of family, love, and God. Los Niños are Catholic.\n\nTheir birthdays are: Tonio, March 27; Ramón, January 7; Santi, September 4; and Coco, September 5.\n\nThey currently live in France.\n\nAlabina's music mixes many styles, cultures, and languages: Middle Eastern, Spanish music, French, raï, flamenco, gypsy, Arabic, and at times, Western pop. The group often takes older songs, for example, \"Habibi Ya Nour El Ain\" the Arabic song of Amr Diab, and adds a mix of styles and languages and Alabina's own flavor. The new version, \"Habibi de Mis Amores\" in both Arabic and Spanish, is one example. Another example is \"Lolole (Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood)\", which Alabina turned into an upbeat Arabic-Spanish song, which though it can be recognized from the melody, is far from its original: a Western pop song in English. \"Habibi Ya Nour El Ain\" performed by Alabina, Ishtar was used in a bollywood movie Agent Vinod (2012 film) scene background when Agent Vinod and Freddie Khambatta are seen walking out of Morocco Airport. However their song was not credited by the producers of Agent Vinod (2012 film). The song \"Alabina\" is well known in France for being the end credits music in the French comedies \"La Vérité si je mens!\" and \"La Vérité si je mens! 2\". Their single \"Ole y ola\" reached number 19 on the French music charts in 1997 and was certified silver. The single \"Alabina\" spent 21 weeks on the charts, peaking at 29.\n\n\n\nYoutube.com (For her music)\n"}

{"id": "2027657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027657", "title": "Julien Duvivier", "text": "Julien Duvivier\n\nJulien Duvivier (; 8 October 1896, in Lille – 29 October 1967, in Paris) was a French film director. He was prominent in French cinema in the years 1930–1960. Amongst his most original films, chiefly notable are \"La Bandera\", \"Pépé le Moko\", \"Little World of Don Camillo\", \"Panique\", \"Voici le temps des assassins\" and \"\". \n\nJean Renoir called him, a \"great technician, [a] rigorist, a poet\".\n\nIt was as an actor, in 1916 at the Théâtre de l'Odéon under the direction of André Antoine, that Duvivier's career began. In 1918 he moved on to Gaumont, as a writer and assistant of, amongst others, André Antoine, Louis Feuillade and Marcel L'Herbier. In 1919 he directed his first film. In the 1920s several of his films had a religious concern: \"Credo ou la tragédie de Lourdes\", \"L'abbé Constantin\" and \"La Vie miraculeuse de Thérèse Martin\" — a film about the Carmelite saint Thérèse of Lisieux.\n\nIn the 1930s Duvivier was part of the production company, 'Film d'Art', founded by Marcel Vandal and Charles Delac and he worked as part of a team. He stayed with them for nine years. \"David Golder\" (1930), was his first success. It was also his first 'talkie', as it was of the actor Harry Baur. They worked together many more times in the 1930s. In 1934 Duvivier collaborated with Jean Gabin for the first time in the film \"Maria Chapdelaine\", while for \"La Bandera\" (1935), he availed himself of the writing talent of Charles Spaak, who had previously worked with Jacques Feyder, Jean Grémillon, Marc Allégret and Marcel L'Herbier. They too would work together many times from this point onwards. Having made \"Le Golem\" (1936), a remake of an earlier , Duvivier set out on \"La belle équipe\" (also 1936), with Jean Gabin, Charles Vanel and Raymond Aimos. The film remains a significant example of his work. Five unemployed men hit the lottery jackpot and decide to buy a seaside café/dance hall together. The unexpected, however, keeps happening. Once jealousy over a woman, Gina, (Viviane Romance), gets mixed up with the venture, there is little left to save. The original ending of the film involving a killing, was judged too pessimistic, and another, happier ending, was filmed. It was the happier version that was released, though both versions still survive. \"L'Homme du jour\" (1936), with Maurice Chevalier in the lead role is a minor work in the director's canon but \"Pépé le Moko\" and \"Un Carnet de Bal\" (both 1937) are incontestable summits.\n\n\"Pépé le Moko\", which plunges into the midst of the gangster underworld and which had the Casbah (Arab quarter) of Algiers for exotic backdrop, was the film which propelled Jean Gabin into the category of an international star. In 1938 Duvivier signed a contract with MGM and made his first American film, a biopic of Johann Strauss, \"The Great Waltz\". The next year, back in France, he made \"La Fin du Jour\", in which theatre actors in retirement struggle to see that their retirement home remains open. Michel Simon played an old ham actor, and Louis Jouvet, an old leading actor who still believes in his seductive powers. \"La Charrette fantôme\" followed, a horror film adapted from a novel by Selma Lagerlöf. In 1940 \"Untel père et fils\", a family history starring Raimu, Michèle Morgan, and Louis Jouvet, was not able to be shown — because of the political situation — until the end of the war, at least in France. It is generally considered a minor work, and even a failure.\n\nDuring World War II, Duvivier left to work in the United States. He made five films in these years. \"Lydia\" (1941); two anthology films, \"Tales of Manhattan\" (1942) with Charles Boyer and Rita Hayworth among leading actors, and \"Flesh and Fantasy\" (1943) with Edward G. Robinson, Charles Boyer and Barbara Stanwyck; \"The Impostor\" (1944), again with Jean Gabin; and \"Destiny\" (also 1944), a Reginald Le Borg directed film which was built around a cut thirty-minute sequence from \"Flesh and Fantasy\" (Duvivier was uncredited) .\n\nOn his return to France, Duvivier experienced some difficulties in resuming his career. \"Panique\" (1946), an exhaustive summary of the lowest of human instincts, was the most personal, darkest, and nihilistic of his works. It was a bitter failure with critics and the public. Duvivier continued, notwithstanding, to work in France until the end of his life, apart from a short period in Great Britain to shoot \"Anna Karenina\" (1948) and to Spain for \"Black Jack\" (1950).\n\n\"Under the Sky of Paris\" (1951) is a highly original film from the point of view of the way the film was cut. In the course of a day in Paris, one follows people whose paths will cross. The same year Duvivier shot the first of the humorous Don Camillo films from the Giovanni Guareschi books, \"Le Petit monde de Don Camillo\". It met with immediate popular success and he followed its success with \"The Return of Don Camillo\" (1953). The series continued with other directors.\n\nIn \"Voici le temps des assassins\" (1956), Jean Gabin plays a decent restaurateur in Les Halles who is swindled by a cynical young woman, Catherine, (Danièle Delorme). Duvivier co-wrote and directed two films in 1957: the drama \"Lovers of Paris\" (starring Gérard Philipe) and the comedy-thriller \"The Man in the Raincoat\" (starring Fernandel and Bernard Blier).\n\n\"Marie-Octobre\" (1959) followed, featuring Danielle Darrieux, Serge Reggiani, and Bernard Blier amongst others. It was an exercise in style; 11 people, nine men, two women, and a mise en scène that followed the unities of time, place, and action, it had a constant concern for the framing of the composition to reinforce an inquisitorial, menacing atmosphere. The same year he was invited to be part of the jury of the Cannes Film Festival, 1959, the year the Nouvelle Vague fully emerged. Duvivier's final portmanteau film was \"Le Diable et les dix Commandements\" (1962), while the scenario of \"Chair de poule\" (1963) has a resemblance to \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" and again features an unscrupulous woman.\n\nDuring the fall of 1967, just as the production of \"Diaboliquement vôtre\" reached completion, a film about a man made amnesiac following a car accident, Duvivier himself was in a traffic accident, triggering a heart attack which killed him. He was 71; he left behind a filmography comprising nearly 70 films. He is buried in the cemetery of Rueil-Malmaison in the Hauts-de-Seine.\n"}

(August 9, 1906 – January 5, 1985) was an American cinematographer who won three Academy Awards for the films \"King Solomon's Mines\", \"The Bad and the Beautiful\" and the 1959 version of \"Ben Hur\". Surtees worked at various studios, including Universal, UFA, Warner Brothers, and MGM, lighting for such luminaries as Howard Hawks, Mike Nichols, and William Wyler, gaining him a reputation as one of the most versatile cinematographers of his time.\n\nRobert L. Surtees was born in Covington, Kentucky, on September 8, 1906. He grew up in Ohio where he got a job as a photographer and retoucher at a portrait studio in Cincinnati. Surtees then moved to New York City for a year to study photography, but always had a goal of becoming a cinematographer.\n\nWith an intention to attend college, Surtees moved to California in 1925. Roy C. Hunter at Universal offered him a job after some of his work was published in Towing Topics Automotive Club magazine. He assisted Harry Neumann, ASC, on a Hoot Gibson Western \"Hey, Hey Cowboy\" in 1925, Jerry Ash, ASC, on the Andy Gump comedies also in 1925, and Jackson Rose, ASC, on the Reginald Denny \"Leather Pushers\" series in 1926. \"The Man Who Laughs\" (1928), photographed by Gil Warrenton, ASC was Surtees' first high budget picture as an assistant.\n\nFrom 1928 to 1929 Surtees worked for Universal and UFA as an assistant to Charles Stumar in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. Some sources say that he assisted Gregg Toland and Joseph Ruttenburg in the latter years of the 1920s before going abroad and this is what kick started his career. In 1930 Surtees returned to California and assisted Hal Mohr, ASC, on \"King of Jazz.\" He went on to shoot 36 pictures with Mohr at Universal, Warner Brothers, Pathé and Fox Studios over a period of 6 years from 1930 to 1936. In 1935, Surtees applied to be a member of the ASC as a camera operator just after completing 13 weeks as on operator at Warner Brother's Studios on the film \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1935).\n\nSurtees' first film as a director of photography was \"This Precious Freedom\" (1942), a propaganda film made for the US army, which was only released to the military.\n\nHe shot a few more pictures with various directors such as Frank Buck and Ed Sutherland on \"Jacquerai\" in September 1942, and Les Goodwins on \"Ice Capades\" in October 1942. On October 20, 1942, Surtees submitted another application to ASC as a director of photography while employed at Freelance Independent Producers.\n\nShortly after this Surtees landed a job at MGM where he began his long tenure and produced his most notable work beginning with \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\", shot alongside Harold Rosson, ASC and nominated for an Oscar in the category of Black and White Cinematography in 1944. Robert Surtees went on to film nearly 100 motion pictures in his 48-year career, including \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1950), \"The Bad and the Beautiful\" (1952), and \"Ben Hur\" (1959), which each won an Oscar. Not to mention his 13 other films that also received nomination for Best Cinematography, including \"The Graduate\" (1967), \"The Last Picture Show\" (1971), and \"The Sting\" (1973).\n\nSurtees was a sought-after cinematographer because of his versatility -— \"I have liked doing all kinds of pictures—musical, comedies, and action-adventure\". He also gained a reputation for being a stickler for precise color control and proper exposure of the negative, arranging his lighting and camera angles so he could provide the lab with the best negative he could make.\n\nSurtees enjoyed experimenting with lighting, and always found ways to properly light a scene, even without all the necessary equipment; for instance, on \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1950), when generators could not be transported throughout the dense African jungle, Surtees lit the whole film with reflectors.\n\nHe also played a role with regards to technological innovations, being one of the first to use a telephoto lens (500mm) in \"The Graduate\" (1967).\n\nHe married his wife Maydell before moving to California in the mid-1920s and had two daughters Linda Lowers and Nancy Corby, as well as two sons, Thomas and Bruce.\nBruce Surtees was also a director of photography, working alongside his father on \"Lost Horizon\" (1973), as a first cameraman on a second camera unit.\n\nRobert Surtees died on January 5, 1985, following a long illness.\n\nRobert L.

{"id": "2027674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027674", "title": "1999 Odisha cyclone", "text": "1999 Odisha cyclone\n\nThe 1999 Odisha cyclone (IMD designation BOB 06, JTWC designation 05B) was the most intense recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and among the most destructive in the region. The 1999 Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25 October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of convection in the Sulu Sea four days prior. The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day. Aided by highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28 October, before peaking on the next day with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg). The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29 October. The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 4 November over the Bay of Bengal.\n\nAlthough its primary effects were felt in a localized area of India, the outer fringes of the super cyclone impacted Myanmar and Bangladesh. Ten people were killed in the former, while two were killed in the latter by the storm's rainbands. The storm was the most severe to strike Odisha in the 20th century, raking the state and adjacent areas with high storm surge, powerful winds, and torrential rainfall. The storm's impacts exacerbated the damage caused by a very severe cyclone that struck the same region less than two weeks earlier. The 5–6 m (16–20 ft) surge brought water up to 35 km (20 mi) inland, carrying along with it coastal debris and inundating towns and villages. The surge combined with heavy rains to produce widespread flooding, damaging around 1.6 million homes and causing rivers to breach 20,005 flood embankments. The storm's effects destroyed numerous crops, including sugar cane, rice, and other winter-time harvests. Although estimates of the death toll varied significantly—at times suggesting 30,000 fatalities—the Government of India enumerated 9,887 fatalities in the country, of which a majority were caused by storm surge; over 8,000 deaths occurred in Jagatsinghpur. The total damage cost of the destruction wrought by the super cyclone amounted to US$4.44 billion.\n\nRecovery efforts were extensive following the storm's passage. The Government of India allocated ₹3 billion (US$69.3 million) to the Odisha state government, supplementing earlier contributions made towards relief from the earlier cyclone. Various branches of the Indian Armed Forces were dispatched to aid the recovery efforts. Contributions from foreign governments amounted to nearly US$13 million, with more than half allocated by the United States. Alongside foreign and domestic government contributions, between 12–14 international aid agencies concurrently participated in relief efforts in the storm's aftermath.\n\nAlthough the storm organized into a tropical cyclone in the Andaman Sea, the origins of the 1999 Odisha cyclone can be traced back to an area of convection that began developing in the Sulu Sea on 21 October. Despite some signs of development, wind shear suppressed outflow and prevented any significant organization. Tracking westward, the disturbance encountered a more favorable environment in the South China Sea; as a result, thunderstorm activity began to increase. Prompted by these changes, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 02:00 UTC on 23 October. However, the system failed to develop any further before wind shear reemerged in the Gulf of Thailand, causing convection to diminish and resulting in the cancellation of the TCFA. On 24 October, the storm crossed the Malay Peninsula and moved into the Andaman Sea by 03:00 UTC on the following day. Although the environment remained moderately unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the disturbance organized, developing fair outflow, a strong rainband, and additional convection. At 06:00 UTC on 25 October, the system became a tropical depression while centered 550 km (340 mi) east of Port Blair. As such, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as \"BOB 06\". With the storm now steadily organizing, the JTWC once again issued a TCFA at 19:30 UTC on 25 October; early the following day, the IMD assessed that the nascent depression had strengthened into a cyclonic storm. At the time, the storm was located 325 km (200 mi) south-southeast of Rangoon, Myanmar.\n\nUnder the steering influence of an upper-level ridge to its northeast, BOB 06 began to take a more northwesterly course. The ridge also provided a highly conducive environment for intensification and eventually became positioned atop the strengthening cyclonic storm, slowing the cyclone and allowing it to generate good outflow. With these conditions in place, BOB 06 entered a phase of rapid intensification, strengthening faster than climatological rates. BOB 06 strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm at 03:00 UTC on 27 October and attained very severe cyclonic storm intensity just nine hours later with the storm centered 650 km (405 mi) south of Chittagong, Bangladesh. An eye emerged on visible satellite imagery early on 28 October, and at 15:00 UTC that day, the IMD classified BOB 06 as a super cyclonic storm, the highest rating on the IMD's cyclone scale. Using the Dvorak technique, the IMD estimated that BOB 06 reached its peak intensity three hours later with maximum sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg); this made BOB 06 the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean by pressure with sustained winds at the time matched by only two other known cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. At the time, the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone was the only storm in the region of comparable intensity. Although the storm's organization and appearance deteriorated as it neared land, BOB 06's intensity held steady up until it made landfall on the Odisha coast between Puri and Kendrapara at 06:00 UTC on 29 October.\n\nRather than moving inland as forecast, the tropical cyclone became quasi-stationary over the coastal Jajpur area as it laid within a weak steering region between two upper-level anticyclones. Remaining situated over land, the storm steadily weakened as it began to advect dry air into its circulation, deteriorating into a cyclonic storm on 30 October. The entraining of dry air limited thunderstorm activity to a single rainband to the system's northeast. Soon, the weakening storm became caught in a mid-tropospheric wind flow, inducing a southward drift that brought BOB 06 back over the Bay of Bengal. The cyclone continued to weaken over water, and the IMD stopped monitoring the storm on 31 October; the JTWC followed suit a day later. The remnant low-pressure system continued to meander around the area for a few more days before eventually dissipating. \n\nThe Indian Meteorological Department periodically issued cyclone warning bulletins during the storm's lifetime, with the first being directed to the Chief Secretary of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 26 October; the first bulletin noted potential impacts and advised fishermen not to venture out to sea. Six warnings were issued for the islands, with the last being issued on 27 October once the storm passed to the north and west. Due to initial uncertainty in the storm's forecast track, the first warnings for the coast of mainland India on 27 October concerned northern Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. Hourly dissemination of cyclone bulletins were carried out by Doordarshan and All India Radio beginning on 28 October. These warnings eventually narrowed in scope to the eventually affected areas, with the last warning being issued for Odisha on 31 October.\n\nThe Indian Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC) served as the primary administrative body for coordinating preparatory and relief work during the 1999 Odisha cyclone. Upon the storm's formation, the DAC requested the chief secretaries and relief commissioners of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal to begin storm preparations and initiate evacuations if necessary. Evacuations in Odisha involved nearly 150,000 people living within 10 km (6 mi) of the coastline in five districts. Six districts maintained 23 permanent cyclone shelters operated by the Indian Red Cross Society, eventually serving to house 30,000 evacuees. At Paradip Port, twelve docked ships were evacuated out to sea to avoid the cyclone. In neighboring West Bengal, 200,000 people were evacuated from the state's vulnerable low-lying islands. The Indian Army was placed on stand-by, and food supplies were stocked up in prone regions. Train service was cancelled for the areas expected to be impacted by the cyclone.\n\nIn Myanmar, 10 people were killed and 20,000 families were displaced.\n\nPassing south of Bangladesh, the 1999 Odisha super cyclone's northern fringes swept across the country, killing two people and initially causing 200 fishermen to go missing. Substantial damage to housing was reported.\n\nThe state of Odisha sustained the most catastrophic damage associated with Cyclone BOB 06, which was considered the state's severest cyclone of the 20th century. The damage was compounded by the earlier impact of a very severe cyclonic storm that struck nearby areas just 11 days earlier. Twelve districts of Odisha suffered severe damage, reporting complete breakdown of essential services: Balasore, Bhadrak, Cuttack, Dhenkanal, Jagatsinghpur, Jajpur, Keonjhar, Kendrapara, Khurda, Puri, Mayurbhanj, and Nayagarh. Among these, the blocks of Erasma and Kujang in Jagatsinghpur were the worst affected. In total, 12.9 million people were affected by the storm; estimates for the storm's death toll vary significantly, though the India Meteorological Department indicated that around 9,887 were killed, with an additional 40 persons missing and 2,507 others injured. The majority of these deaths occurred in Jagatsinghpur. where 8,119 were killed. The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' EM-DAT disaster database indicates that 10,915 people were killed. However, other estimates suggested that the death toll may have been as high as 30,000. The storm's effects damaged 1.6 million homes across 14,643 villages and 97 blocks. In turn, 2.5 million people were marooned. A total of 18,420 km (7,110 mi) of crop land was impacted, and 444,000 livestock casualties were also reported. The sugar cane crop was destroyed alongside other kharif and rabi crops. About 2 million tonnes (2.2 million tons) of the winter rice crop was destroyed. Total damage caused by the destructive cyclone amounted to US$4.4444 billion.\n\nAlong the Odisha coast, the cyclone generated a 5–6 m (16–20 ft) storm surge that brought water up to 35 km (20 mi) inland, inundating a large swath of coastal areas. The Indian Ministry of Urban Development estimated a peak storm surge height of 6.7 m (22 ft). One visually estimated storm surge of 9 m (30 ft) was reported; however, this estimate was determined to have been too high. Regardless, no in-situ measurement of the peak storm surge exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by the storm. Storm surge was responsible for a majority of the fatalities linked to the 1999 Odisha cyclone, accounting for around 7,000 deaths. The intense wave action sank 9,085 fishing boats and caused the loss of 22,143 fishing nets. Some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1.5–2.0 km (0.9–1.2 mi) inland. A 4 km (2.5 mi) stretch of road leading out of Paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and 0.5 km (0.3 mi) in width. Paradip Port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power transmission system, though its core infrastructure remained intact. Damage at the port was estimated at around ₹300 million (US$6.9 million). The storm surge destroyed nearly every house in Paradip near the point of landfall. In Gopalpur, 27 villages were submerged by the surge. To the south in southern Andhra Pradesh, 48 trawlers sank. To the north in West Bengal, Substantial damage to housing was reported, causing injuries to 30 people in Midnapore.\n\nStations in Paradip and Bhubaneswar each recorded sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) before their instruments failed. Winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) were measured in Puri as the cyclone passed to the north. The strong winds damaged electric lines and uprooted trees over 50 years old in Puri and Kendrapada. Downed power lines across the state cut off communications between Odisha and the rest of the world for over 24 hours and caused widespread power outages. According to the Southern Electricity Supply Corporation, damage to the power grid caused by the cyclone totaled ₹330 million (US$4.4 million). Stalling over land, the Odisha cyclone dropped torrential rainfall, with 24-hour rainfall rates at times exceeding 20 cm (7.9 in); Paradip documented 53 cm (20.9 in) over one 24-hour period. Over the course of the storm's passage, total rainfall amounts over 60 cm (23.6 in) occurred over a large swath of Odisha. The highest recorded rainfall total was documented in Oupada, which measured 95.5 cm (37.60 in) of rain over a three-day period. Flooding caused by the storm was estimated to have killed approximately 2,000 people. The heavy rains flattened thatched huts and damaged roads and other infrastructure. Within the seven worst affected districts, over 70% of homes were destroyed; most of these were thatched homes, though 10–15% of non-thatch roofed homes were also destroyed. Approximately 11,000 schools were either significantly damaged or destroyed. All major district roads in the area were either washed out or blocked by felled trees. In Bhubaneswar, 60% of trees were flattened by the winds and rain; aerial surveys revealed that the entire city was submerged by floodwaters. Adjacent areas were nearly stripped of all tree cover. Until 8 November, the city remained without power. The inundation induced by the far-reaching storm surge and heavy rain kept Konark submerged in knee-deep water for six days after landfall. Over the course of four days, the excessive rainfall caused the flooding of the Baitarani, Brahmani, Budhabalanga, Kharasua, and Salandi rivers, resulting in 20,005 flood embankment breaches and the damaging of 6 headworks. Thousands of people suffered chemical burns after the flooding mixed industrial chemicals into bathing ponds. Oswal Chemicals and Fertilisers, which maintained the world's largest diammonium phosphate plant, reported severe damage to the facility. In the five districts most affected, all electric water pumps were disabled, though hand pumps remained operable.\n\nThe Government of India declared a national disaster in the aftermath of the cyclone, though international appeals were initially unanticipated. The destruction wrought by the cyclone was expected to cause a six-month-long total loss of normal livelihood. Damage sustained to various sanitation infrastructure led to a heightened risk of communicable disease outbreaks; indeed, diarrhea and cholera saw increased incidences following the storm's impact. Within a month of the cyclone's landfall, the Odisha state government reported 22,296 cases of diarrheal disorders. The area's vulnerability to disease was also compounded by a lack of pre-storm vaccinations, raising fears of a potential measles outbreak. The outbreak of diseases caused by the storm's effects stabilized by February 2000. For most locations, the initial loss of telecommunication and rail operation was restored within a few days.\n\nPrime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced the allocation of ₹3 billion (US$69.3 million) to the Odisha state government, supplementing an earlier allocation of US$59.5 million made towards relief from the cyclone that struck the region earlier that October. However, the Odisha state government demanded a larger commitment of ₹5 billion (US$73.3 million) for relief alongside ₹25 billion (US$366.7 million) for rehabilitation. The federal government also considered the establishment of a Department for Natural Disaster Management to handle the devastation caused by the cyclone. Ultimately, a \"High Powered Task Force\" was formed under the command of the Ministry of Defence to provide rehabilitation support. The Indian Army sent infantry, engineers, and signal detachments to assist with disaster relief, including a field medical unit containing 30 ambulances and 340 doctors. Indian Air Force helicopters dropped food packets in affected regions beginning on 30 October, while other government ground personnel distributed various relief supplies including vaccines and plastic sheeting. Due to severe damage to air traffic control infrastructure, the Biju Patnaik International Airport was closed until 2 November, curtailing relief operations. Schools that survived the cyclone were repurposed as temporary shelters for those displaced. Due to the high amount of animal carcasses, the Government of India offered US$3 for every carcass burned–higher than minimum wage. However, backlash led the government to fly in 200 Dalits from New Delhi and 500 from Odisha to carry out the carcass removal.\n\nOn 2 November, the Canadian International Development Agency contributed C$150,000 (US$203,964) to the International Federation of the Red Cross to aid the recovery effort; Canada eventually doubled their contributions through the Canadian Lutheran World Relief and CARE. The European Commission channeled €2 million (US$2.1 million) through the European Community Humanitarian Office for use by various relief organizations. Contributions to aid agencies were also made by the British Department for International Development (DFID), with initial contributions made to Christian Aid and CARE totaling £330,000 (US$540,837). DFID's initial emergency assistance was later increased to £3 million (US$4.9 million) and supplemented by a £25 million ($40.9 million) contribution over the course of six months. The Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit allocated CHF 800,000 (US$779,666) to five Swiss relief organizations operating in India. Food aid worth A$300,000 (US$191,700) was sent by the Australian Government and delivered to approximately 1 million people through the World Food Program. Other countries sent aid through their respective International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies branch. Following an initial disaster declaration by United States Ambassador to India Dick Celeste, the United States Agency for International Development contributed US$7,482,000 through Food for Peace and the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to complement recovery efforts. The United Nations Children's Fund allocated more than US$100,000 to help supply basic health and shelter needs, while the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs made a similar allocation through an emergency grant and with reserves from an earlier grant from Norway.\n\nBetween 12–14 international aid agencies were concurrently active in Odisha in the storm's aftermath. The Odisha Government made appeals to various non-governmental organizations as the government's relief supplies only covered 40% of affected areas. In response to the storm's devastation, Oxfam prepared an initial aid package, including emergency water equipment worth £250,000 (US$306,665) and 50,000 instant meals. Several members of the Action by Churches Together Alliance made contributions to the post-cyclone relief efforts. Lutheran World Relief made initial grants of US$15,000 each to the Church's Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA) and Lutheran World Federation for emergency programs in northeastern India. The United Evangelical Lutheran Churches in India sent US$700,000 worth of various relief supplies in concert with CASA. The Indian Red Cross Society distributed relief supplies from their zonal warehouse in Calcutta, with initial supplies valued at CHF 20,000 (US$19,491). In addition to the Indian society of the Red Cross, a joint Indian and International Federation assessment team was assembled to survey the damage. CARE carried over its preexisting relief operations from the early October cyclone, routing food supplies by train to hard-hit locations in Odisha. The Odisha state branch of the Red Cross extended the emergency relief phase to a three-month relief operation and a six-month rehabilitation program with the help of the Federation. The overall humanitarian response spanned well into late 2000. Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha dispatched aid to 91 villages greatly affected by the storm in the Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapada districts; medical camps were established in 32 villages. Three villages were \"adopted\" by BAPS Charities in January 2000 to rebuild in Jagatsinghpur: Chakulia, Banipat, and Potak. A total of 200 concrete homes were constructed, as well as two concrete schools and two village tube-wells. The project was finally completed in May 2002, two and a half years after the cyclone hit. Similarly, Oxfam facilitated various restoration projects in the Ganjam district, including in the communities of Denotified Tribes.\n\nRunoff caused by the cyclone enhanced available nutrients in the Bay of Bengal, supplementing the already present equatorward ocean current and resulting in an increase in chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon in the region.\n\n\n"}

To clarify the parentage of Lacrosse:\n\nMinnesota 78 is recorded as a cross of Beta by Witt, however many have disputed this pedigree based its characteristics, and Elmer Swenson speculated that the pollen parent was likely Jessica, which was used in many crosses. Beta is a cross of a selection of the wild grape \"Vitis riparia\", Carver, by Concord. Jessica is a cross of a selection of \"Vitis labrusca\" by \"Vitis aestivalis\". Seyval is a cross of Seibel 5656 and Seibel S4986. Both these hybrids are a complex set of crosses of other Seibel hybrids.\n\nSpelling variants in use by wineries and vendors of the hybrid include La Crosse, LaCrosse and Lacrosse. The Lacrosse spelling is preferred by viticulturists. The registry the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations registry for LABELING AND ADVERTISING OF WINE \n, however, lists only \"LaCrosse.\" \n"}

Prior to his appointment to the upper house in 2008, he was the Ottawa editor for CTV News Channel.\n\nMike Duffy was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island to Lillian and Wilfrid Duffy, and is the grandson of Charles Gavan Duffy, a PEI Liberal MLA and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island.\n\nDuffy studied humanities at St. Dunstan's College.\n\nDuffy became a ham radio operator at the age of 16 and began his career as a teen disc jockey at CFCY-TV. He moved to print journalism with \"The Guardian\" in Charlottetown, before heading to CFCF in Montreal as a lineup and assignment editor in 1969, and in 1971 he joined CFRA radio in Ottawa as a political reporter.\n\nDuffy joined CBC radio's Parliament Hill bureau in 1974, and became a reporter for the flagship television newscast \"\" in 1977. Duffy became the lead CBC television reporter on Parliament Hill and covered the elections and most of the important federal stories of the Trudeau, Clark and Mulroney governments. Duffy is primarily known for his work as an Ottawa journalist, but he has been a foreign correspondent. He covered the fall of South Vietnam in April 1975 and was one of the last journalists to leave before the arrival of North Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong insurgents.\n\nIn 1988, Duffy joined Baton Broadcasting as the first host of its Sunday morning news program \"Sunday Edition\" based in Ottawa. When that series ended in 1999, Duffy moved to his role as a show host and interviewer with CTV Newsnet (now the CTV News Channel). Long known as an \"Ottawa insider\", he was able to get many elected officials to appear on his programs. Duffy hosted two programs on CTV Newsnet, \"Countdown with Mike Duffy\" and \"Mike Duffy Live\", which was broadcast in the supper hour news slot. Duffy was also a popular speaker at conferences, annual meetings and other events across Canada and, writer Stevie Cameron noted in her 1990 book \"Ottawa Inside Out\", was probably the most-recognized journalist on Parliament Hill.\n\nOn May 27, 2009, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council ruled Duffy violated Canadian broadcasting codes during the 2008 Canadian federal election. It concluded that Duffy's decision to re-broadcast an earlier ATV Halifax broadcast of ‘false starts’ of an interview with then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion “was not fair, balanced, or even handed.” The Panel also concluded that, during the same broadcast, Duffy “significantly misrepresented the view of one of the three members of his Panel...Liberal MP Geoff Regan.” The panel thus concluded “that the consistent misrepresentation by host Mike Duffy of the MP’s point of view constituted an unfair and improper presentation of opinion or comment contrary to clause 6 of the CAB Code of Ethics.\"\n\nIn 1986 he won an ACTRA Award for live television reporting, for his coverage of the 1985 Turkish embassy attack in Ottawa by the Armenian Revolutionary Army. In 1994, Duffy was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame.\n\nDuffy has received honorary degrees from the University of Prince Edward Island, as well as Wilfrid Laurier University and from Niagara University in Niagara Falls, New York. He has been a visiting fellow at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina, and has been twice nominated for the \"best in the business\" award by the \"Washington Journalism Review\".\n\nIn 2002, he was awarded the Golden Jubilee Medal by the Governor General of Canada on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nOn December 22, 2008, Duffy was named a Prince Edward Island representative to the Senate on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, sitting as a Conservative. He subsequently retired as a TV journalist at the end of 2008. He was introduced to the Senate on 26 January 2009 immediately prior to the Speech from the Throne.\n\nIn 2012, Duffy was accused by the media and Senate of improperly claiming primary residency outside of Ottawa in order to claim living expenses for time working in Ottawa. Three other senators, with different fact cases, were also accused of filing false expenses. On February 28, 2013, the Senate Committee on the Internal Economy announced that Duffy, Pamela Wallin, Mac Harb, and Patrick Brazeau would be subject to a forensic audit to determine appropriateness of their expense claims. After several weeks of negative publicity, Duffy, despite believing he was entitled to claim the PEI residence, volunteered to pay back the expenses he had claimed for his Ottawa residence. Prime Minister Harper's Chief of Staff, Nigel Wright wrote a personal cheque to Duffy for $90,172 to cover past residency expenses claimed as part of an agreement Duffy made with the Prime Minister's Office. Duffy then repaid the Government of Canada $90,172 in March 2013. Duffy resigned from the Conservative caucus on May 16, 2013, and became an independent senator. On November 5, 2013 the Senate voted to suspend Duffy and two other senators. However, in his trial decision exonerating Duffy in 2016, Ontario Superior Court Judge Charles Vaillancourt said Duffy had not falsely claimed living expenses. The judge said Duffy had no choice in the matter, as he had been appointed to represent Prince Edward Island in the Senate.\n\nOn July 17, 2014 Duffy was charged by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with 31 offences. Duffy was acquitted of all charges on April 21, 2016. Ontario Court Justice Charles Vaillancourt ruled: \"Mr. Neubauer (the Crown prosecutor) stated that Senator Duffy’s actions were driven by deceit, manipulations and carried out in a clandestine manner representing a serious and marked standard expected of a person in Senator Duffy’s position of trust. I find that if one were to substitute the PMO, Nigel Wright and others for Senator Duffy in the aforementioned sentence that you would have a more accurate statement.\" The judge ruled Duffy had no choice but to list his Prince Edward Island home as his principal residence, as he had been appointed a senator from that province and was constitutionally required to be resident there. Duffy's \"free will\" had been \"overwhelmed\" and he had \"capitulated\" as a result of the PMO's -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper's office, that is, -- \"threatening efforts,\" the judge said. The Superior Court judge said Duffy had been pressured by senior members of the Prime Minister's staff to admit to improper expense accounts when they were, in fact, legitimate, adding \"the real deceit came from Harper's office.\" \nRobert Fife, now the Globe and Mail's Ottawa bureau chief, won an award for his reporting on the so-called \"Senate scandal.\" On the day Sen. Duffy was acquitted, Fife claimed he had been repeatedly misled by the Harper PMO. He went on to declare the scandal was a \"manipulative hoax\" by Nigel Wright foisted on the Canadian public. \"From the beginning when I broke that story on the $90,000. The Prime Minister’s Office every step of the way lied to me, they lied to Canadians. And inch by inch we were able to scale back and find out one lie after another, one lie after another. And then in the summertime when Nigel Wright and the other key lieutenants in the Prime Minister’s Office were put on the stand, we saw just how this manipulative hoax was put on the Canadian public.\" Duffy immediately resumed his seat in the Senate and now sits as an Independent.\n\nOn August 24, 2017, Duffy filed a lawsuit against the Senate and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seeking damages of C$ 8 million. Duffy alleged the RCMP was liable for negligent investigation. He accused the Senate of abuse of process and breaching its duty to provide him with a fair hearing before suspending him. Duffy accused the Senate of acting under media pressure and adding to stress that took a heavy toll on his health.\n\nIn December 2018 the Ontario Superior Court dismissed Duffy's lawsuit against the Senate. The decision by Justice Sally Gomery included this statement: \"Allowing a court to revisit the Senate's decisions at issue here would interfere with the Senate's ability to function as an independent legislative body, equal to other branches of government\". Duffy's suit against the RCMP, based on alleged negligence in their investigation, was not affected by this decision.\n\nIn January 2019, Duffy filed an appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal.\n\n"}

{"id": "2027786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027786", "title": "White people in Zimbabwe", "text": "White people in Zimbabwe\n\nWhite Zimbabweans (historically referred to as white Rhodesians or simply Rhodesians) are people from the southern African country Zimbabwe who are White (Caucasian/European). In linguistic cultural and historical terms, these Zimbabweans of European ethnic origin are divided among the English-speaking descendants of British and Irish settlers, the Afrikaans-speaking descendants of Afrikaners from South Africa, and those descended from Greek and Portuguese settlers.\n\nA small number of ethnic Europeans first came to Zimbabwe, then the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia, as settlers during the late-nineteenth century. A steady migration of white people continued for the next 75 years. The white population of Zimbabwe reached a peak of about 277,000 in 1975-6, representing around 4.5% of the population. Mass emigration after the fall of Rhodesia at the end of the Rhodesian Bush War left white numbers at around 100,000 in 1980 and just 70,000 by 2000. The white population of Zimbabwe was listed as 28,732 in the 2012 census.\n\nPresent-day Zimbabwe (known as Southern Rhodesia from 1895) was selected as a settlement colony by British South African and Afrikaner colonists from the 1890s onward, following the subjugation of the Matabele, (Ndebele), and Shona nations by the British South Africa Company (BSAC). Early white settlers came in search of mineral resources, finding deposits of coal, chromium, nickel, platinum and gold. They also found some of the richest farmland in Africa. The central portion of Zimbabwe is a plateau that varies in altitude between 900 and 1,500 m (2,950 and 4,900 ft) above sea level. This gives the area a sub-tropical climate which was conducive to European settlement and agricultural practices.\n\nMore than 3,000 white soldiers who assisted in the BSAC takeover of the country were given land grants of or more, and black people living on the land became tenants. Later, Land Apportionment and Tenure Acts reserved extensive low-rainfall areas for black-only tribal-trust lands and high rainfall areas for white ownership, which gave rise to cases of black people being excluded from their own land. White settlers were attracted to Rhodesia by the availability of tracts of prime farmland that could be purchased from the state at low cost. This resulted in a major feature of the Rhodesian economy—the \"white farm\". The white farm was typically a large (>100 km² (>38.6 mi²)) mechanized estate, owned by a white family and employing hundreds of black people. Many white farms provided housing, schools and clinics for black employees and their families. At the time of independence in 1980, more than 40% of the country's farmed land comprised approximately 5,000 white farms. These farms were said to have provided 40% of the country's GDP and up to 60% of its foreign earnings. Major export products included tobacco, beef, sugar, cotton and maize.\n\nThe minerals sector was also important. Gold, asbestos, nickel and chromium were mined by foreign-owned concerns such as Lonrho (Lonmin since 1999) and Anglo American. These operations were usually run by white managers, engineers and foremen.\n\nThe Census of 3 May 1921 found that Southern Rhodesia had a total population of 899,187, of whom 33,620 were Europeans, 1,998 were Coloured (mixed race), 1,250 Asiatics, 761,790 Bantu natives of Southern Rhodesia and 100,529 Bantu aliens. The following year, Southern Rhodesians rejected, in a referendum the option of becoming a province of the Union of South Africa. Instead, the country became a self-governing British colony. It never gained full dominion status, although unlike other colonies it was treated as a \"de facto\" dominion, with its Prime Minister attending the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences.\n\nIn 1891, before Southern Rhodesia was established as a territory, it was estimated that about 1,500 Europeans resided there. This number grew slowly to around 75,000 in 1945. In the period 1945 to 1955 the White population doubled to 150,000, and during that decade 100,000 Black people were forcibly resettled from farmland designated for White ownership. However, some members of the White farming community opposed the forced removal of Black people from land designated for White ownership and some even favoured the handover of underutilised \"White land\" to Black farmers. For example, in 1947, Wedza White farmer Harry Meade unsuccessfully opposed the eviction of his Black neighbour Solomon Ndawa from a irrigated wheat farm. Meade represented Ndawa at hearings of the Land Commission and attempted to protect Ndawa from abusive questioning.\n\nLarge-scale White emigration to Rhodesia did not begin until after the Second World War. At the colony's first comprehensive census in 1962, Rhodesia had 221,000 white residents. At its peak in the mid-1970s Rhodesia's white population consisted of as many as 277,000. There were influxes of White immigrants from the 1940s through to the early-1970s. The most conspicuous group were former British servicemen in the immediate post-war period. But many of the new immigrants were refugees from Communism in Europe, others were former service personnel from British India, others came from Kenya, the Belgian Congo, Zambia, Algeria, and Mozambique. For a time, Rhodesia provided something of a haven for White people who were retreating from decolonisation elsewhere in Africa and Asia.\n\nPost-World War II Rhodesian White settlers were considered different in character from earlier Rhodesian settlers and those from other British colonies, such as Kenya, where settlers were perceived to be drawn from 'the officer class\" and from the British landowning class. By contrast, settlers in Rhodesia after the Second World War were perceived as being drawn from lower social strata and were treated accordingly by the British authorities; as Peter Godwin wrote in \"The Guardian\", \"Foreign Office mandarins dismissed white Rhodesians as lower middle class, no more than provincial clerks and artisans, the lowly NCOs of empire.\"\n\nWhites never accounted for more than 5% of the total population, however, throughout the post-WWII history of Rhodesia. Their share hovered over 5 per cent for only the nine years from 1955 to 1964, peaking in 1961 at 5.7 per cent, and falling thereafter until the end of white rule in 1980 when their actual numbers were most likely less than 3 per cent of the total population. Despite their political prominence, the white farming community never amounted to more than 8% of the total white population and this proportion fell steadily after 1945 up to Zimbabwean independence from the United Kingdom in 1980.\n\nVarious factors encouraged the growth of the White population of Rhodesia. These included the industrialisation and prosperity of the economy in the post-war period. The National Party victory in South Africa was one of the factors that led to the formation of the Central African Federation (1953-1963) so as to provide a bulwark against Afrikaner nationalism. British settlement and investment boomed during the Federation years, as Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Nyasaland (now Malawi) formed a powerful economic unit counterbalancing the economic power of South Africa. The economic power of these three areas was a major factor in the establishment of the Federation through a British Act of Parliament. It was also apparent as early as the 1950s that white rule would continue for longer in Rhodesia than it would in other British colonies such as Zambia (Northern Rhodesia) and Kenya. Many of the new immigrants had a \"not here\" attitude to majority rule and independence.\nRhodesia was run by a white minority government. In 1965, that government declared itself independent through a Unilateral Declaration of Independence ('UDI') under Prime Minister Ian Smith. The UDI project eventually failed, after a period of UN economic sanctions and a civil war known as the Chimurenga (Shona) or Bush War. British colonial rule returned in December 1979, when the country became the British Dependency of Southern Rhodesia. In April 1980, it was granted independence as Zimbabwe.\n\nThe White community kept itself largely separate from the Black and Asian communities in the country. Urban White people lived in separate areas of town, and White people had their own segregated education, healthcare and recreational facilities. Marriage between Black and White people was possible, but remains to the present day very rare. The 1903 Immorality Suppression Ordinance made \"illicit\" (i.e. unmarried) sex between Black men and White women illegal – with a penalty of two years imprisonment for any offending White woman. The majority of the early White immigrants were men and some White men entered into relationships with Black women. The result was a small number of mixed-race persons, 1,998 out of 899,187 total number of inhabitants, according to the 1921 census, some of whom were accepted as being White. A proposal by Garfield Todd (Prime Minister, 1953–1958) to liberalise the laws regarding interracial sex was viewed as dangerously radical. The proposal was rejected and was one factor that led to the political demise of Todd.\n\nWhite Rhodesians enjoyed a very high standard of living. The Land Tenure Act had reserved 30% of agricultural land for White ownership. Black labour costs were low (around US$40 per month in 1975) and included free housing, food and clothing. Nurses earned US$120 per month. The low wages had a large effect in the context of an agricultural economy. Public spending on education, healthcare and other social services was heavily weighted towards White people. Most of the better paid jobs in public service were also reserved for White people. White people in skilled manual occupations enjoyed employment protection against Black competition. In 1975, the average annual income for a White Rhodesian was around US$8,000 () with income tax at a marginal rate of 5% — making them one of the richest communities in the world.\n\nIn 1965, in order to avoid the introduction of Black majority rule (commonly referred to at the time as the Wind of Change), the Government of what was then the self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia issued the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, upon which the country became the \"de facto\" independent — albeit unrecognised — state of Rhodesia.\n\nAs was the case (to varying degrees) in most European colonies, White immigrants took a privileged position in all areas of society. However, the White immigrant position in Rhodesia was distinguished in that the local settler minority entrenched its political, economic and social dominance of the country. Extensive areas of prime farmland were owned by Whites. Senior positions in the public services were reserved for Whites, and Whites working in manual occupations enjoyed legal protection against job competition from Black Africans. As time passed, this situation became increasingly unwelcome to the majority ethnic groups within the country and also to wide sections of international opinion, leading to the Rhodesian Bush War and eventually the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979.\n\nAfter the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, Whites had to adjust to being an ethnic minority in a country with a Black majority government. Although a significant number of Whites remained, many White people emigrated in the early-1980s; both in fear for their lives and an uncertain future. Political unrest and the seizure of many White-owned commercial farms resulted in a further exodus of Whites commencing in 1999. The 2002 census recorded 46,743 White people living in Zimbabwe. More than 10,000 were elderly and fewer than 9,000 were under the age of 15.\n\nAt the time of Zimbabwean independence in 1980, probably around 38% of White Zimbabweans were UK-born, with slightly fewer born in what was once Rhodesia and around 20% from elsewhere in Africa. The White population of that era contained a large transient element and many White people might better be considered foreign expatriates than settlers. Between 1960-1979, White immigration to Rhodesia was around 180,000 while White emigration overseas was 202,000 (with an average White population of around 240,000).\n\nThe country gained its independence as Zimbabwe in April 1980, under a ZANU-PF government led by Robert Mugabe. Following independence, the country's white people lost most of their former privileges. A generous social welfare net (including both education and healthcare) that had supported white people in Rhodesia disappeared almost in an instant. White people in the artisan, skilled worker and supervisory classes began to experience job competition from black people. Indigenisation in the public services displaced many white people. The result was that white emigration gathered pace. In the ten-year period from 1980 to 1990 approximately two thirds of the white population left Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, many white people resolved to stay in the new Zimbabwe. Only a third of the white farming community left. An even smaller proportion of white urban business owners and members of the professional classes left. This pattern of migration meant that although small in absolute numbers, Zimbabwe's white people formed a high proportion of the upper strata of society.\n\nA 1984 article in \"The Sunday Times Magazine\" described and pictured the life of Zimbabwean white people at a time when their number was just about to fall below 100,000. About 49% of emigrants left to settle in South Africa, many of whom were Afrikaans speakers, 29% in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with most of the remainder going to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. Many of these emigrants continue to identify themselves as Rhodesian. A white Rhodesian/Zimbabwean who is nostalgic for the UDI era is known colloquially as a \"Rhodie\". These nostalgic \"Rhodesians\" are also sometimes referred to as \"Whenwes\", because of the nostalgia of \"when we were in Rhodesia\". A white who remained in Zimbabwe and accepted the situation is known as a \"Zimbo\".\n\nThe lifting of UN-imposed economic sanctions and the end of the Bush War at the time of independence produced an immediate 'peace dividend'. Renewed access to world capital markets made it possible to finance major new infrastructure developments in transport and schools. One area of economic growth was tourism, catering in particular to visitors from Europe and North America. Many white people found work in this sector. Another area of growth was horticulture, involving the cultivation of flowers, fruits and vegetables which were air-freighted to market in Europe. Many white farmers were involved in this and in 2002 it was claimed that 8% of horticultural imports into Europe were sourced in Zimbabwe. The economic migrant element among the white population had departed quickly after independence, leaving behind those white people with deeper roots in the country. The country settled and the white population stabilised.\n\nThe 1979 Lancaster House Agreement, which was the basis for independence, had precluded compulsory land redistribution in favour of subsidised voluntary sale of land by white owners, for a period of at least 10 years. The pattern of land ownership established during the Rhodesian state therefore survived for some time after independence. Those white people who were prepared to adapt to the situation they found themselves in were therefore able to continue enjoying a very comfortable existence. In fact, the independence settlement combined with favourable economic conditions plus ESAP (see below) produced a 20-year period of unprecedented prosperity for Zimbabwean white people and for the white farming community in particular. A new class of \"young white millionaires\" appeared in the farming sector. These were typically young Zimbabweans who had applied skills learned in agricultural colleges and business schools in Europe.\n\n\"This is the best government for commercial farmers that this country has ever seen\" John Brown (CFU president), 1989\n\n(Zimbabwe's white people) \"... kept their houses and their pools and their servants. The white farmers had it even better. With crop prices soaring they bought boats on Lake Kariba and built air strips on their farms for newly acquired planes. Zimbabwe's whites reached an implicit understanding with Zanu-PF; they could go on as before, so long as they kept out of politics\" – Chris McGreal, April 2008.\n\nWhite Zimbabweans with professional skills were readily accepted in the new order. For example, Chris Andersen had been the hardline Rhodesian justice minister but made a new career for himself as an independent MP and leading attorney in Zimbabwe. In 1998 he defended former President Canaan Banana in the infamous \"sodomy trial\". At the time of this trial, Andersen spoke out against the attitude of President Mugabe who had described homosexuals as being \"worse than dogs and pigs since they are a colonial invention, unknown in African tradition\"\".\n\nBy the mid-1990s, it is thought that around 120,000 white people remained in Zimbabwe. In spite of this small number, the white Zimbabwean minority maintained control of much of the economy through its investment in commercial farms, industry, and tourism. However, an ongoing programme of land reforms (intended to alter the ethnic balance of land ownership) dislodged many white farmers. The level of violence associated with these reforms in some rural areas made the position of the wider white community uncomfortable. Twenty years after independence, there were 21,000 commercial farmers in the country of whom 4,000 were white and 17,000 were black.\n\nThe \"land issue\" problem came to assume a very high profile in Zimbabwe's political life. ZANU politicians sought to revise Rhodesian land apportionment, which they saw as an injustice that required 'correction', and pressed for land to be transferred from white to black ownership regardless of the resultant disruption to agricultural output. White farmers argued that this served little purpose since Zimbabwe has ample agricultural land much of which was either vacant or only lightly cultivated. Therefore, to their eyes the problem was really a lack of development rather than one of land tenure. White farmers would respond to claims that they owned \"70% of the best arable land\" by stating that what they actually owned was \"70% of the best developed arable land\" – and the two are entirely different things. Whatever the merits of the arguments, in the post-Independence period the Land Issue assumed enormous symbolic importance to all concerned.\nAs the euphoria of independence subsided and as a variety of economic and social problems became evident in the late 1990s, the Land Issue became a focus for trouble.\n\nIn 1999 the government initiated a \"fast track land reform\" programme. This was intended to transfer 4,000 white farms, covering 110,000 km² (42,470 mi²) of mostly prime farmland, to black ownership. The means used to implement the programme were ad-hoc and involved forcible seizure in many cases.\n\nBy mid-2006 only 500 of the original 5,000 white farms were still fully operational. The majority of the white farms that avoided expropriation were in Manicaland and Midlands where it proved possible to do local deals and form strategic partnerships. However, by early 2007, a number of the seized farms were being leased back to their former white owners (although in reduced size and/or on a contract basis) and it is possible that as many as 1,000 of them could be operational again, in some form. Of the 3,500 evicted white farmers it is reported that 2,000 are still in Zimbabwe and are turning their hands to new business enterprises.\n\nWhile the expropriated white farmers themselves have generally moved on to other things, this has not been the case for some of their employees. Former white farm workers from the chargehand/foreman bracket have found themselves in much reduced circumstances. The post-2000 recession has seen the emergence of a class of \"poor white people\". These are typically persons who lack capital, education and skills – and who are therefore unable to migrate from Zimbabwe. Social workers have commented that black people facing difficulties are usually able to fall back on support from extended families. White and coloured people have a much more individualistic culture and appear less able to cope with hardship.\n\nA University of Zimbabwe sociologist told IWPR journalist Benedict Unendoro, the \"esprit de corps\" of the white dominant class in the former Rhodesia prevented the poor white people from becoming a recognisable social group because of the social assistance provided by the dominant social class on racial grounds. This system broke down after the founding of Zimbabwe, causing the number of poor white people to increase especially after 2000, when the confiscation of white-owned farms took its toll. As rich white land owners emigrate or fend for themselves financially, their white employees who mainly worked as supervisors of black labour, found themselves destitute on the streets of cities like Harare, with many found begging around urban centres like Eastlea. The land confiscated from white owners has been redistributed to black peasant farmers and smallholders, acquired by commercial land companies, or persons connected to the regime.\n\nSympathisers of the expropriated white farmers have claimed that lack of professional management skills among the new landholders has resulted in a dramatic decline in Zimbabwe's agricultural production. Indeed, in an effort to boost their own agricultural output, neighbouring countries including Mozambique and Zambia offered land and other incentives to entice Zimbabwe's white farmers to immigrate.\n\nBy 2008, an estimated one in ten out of 5,000 white farmers remained on their land. Many of these continued to face intimidation. By June 2008, it was reported that only 280 white farmers remained and all of their farms were invaded.\n\nOn the day of Mugabe's inauguration as president on 28 June 2008, several white farmers who had protested the seizure of their land were beaten and burned by Robert Mugabe's supporters. In June 2008, a British-born farmer, Ben Freeth (who has had several articles and letters published in the British press regarding the hostile situation), and his in-laws, Mike and Angela Campbell, were abducted and found badly beaten. Mr Campbell, speaking from hospital in Harare, has vowed to continue with his legal fight for his farm. In November 2008, a SADC tribunal ruled that the government had racially discriminated against Mike Campbell and denied him legal redress and prevented him from defending his farm.\n\nJohn Bredenkamp started his trading business during the UDI era when he developed expertise in \"sanctions busting\". He is reported to have arranged the export of Rhodesian tobacco and the import of components (including parts and munitions for the Rhodesian government's force of Hunter jets) in the face of UN trade sanctions. Bredenkamp was able to continue and expand his business after independence, making himself a personal fortune estimated at around US$1 billion.\n\nA number of white entrepreneurs have been attracted to Zimbabwe from other countries in recent years. Controversial British businessman Nicholas van Hoogstraten has built up a 4200 km² (1620 mi²) land holding in central Zimbabwe through his corporate interests (mainly Messina Investments). Far from losing land to resettlement, van Hoogstraten has actually been able to purchase new property since 2000. Van Hoogstraten, a man with a criminal history, has described President Mugabe as \"100 percent decent and incorruptible\" and \"a true English gentleman\". Van Hoogstraten is reported to have arranged supplies for Zimbabwean forces in the DRC and to have underwritten arms deals for the Mugabe administration. However, by 2008 van Hoogstraten appeared to have fallen out with the Zimbabwean establishment.\n\nSeveral white Zimbabwean businessmen, such as Billy Rautenbach, have returned to their native country after working abroad for some years. Rautenbach has succeeded in extending Zimbabwean minerals sector activity into neighbouring countries such as the DRC.\n\nCharles Davy is one of the largest private landowners in Zimbabwe. 53-year-old Davy is reported to own 1,200 km² (460 mi²) of land including farms at Ripple Creek, Driehoek, Dyer's Ranch and Mlelesi. His property has been almost unaffected by any form of land redistribution, and he denies that this fact has any link to his business relationship with the politician Webster Shamu. Davy has said about Shamu \"I am in partnership with a person who I personally like and get along with\". Other views on Shamu are less kind.\n\nDavy is married to Beverley, a former model and \"Miss Rhodesia\" of 1973. Their daughter Chelsy, born and raised in Bulawayo, was the long-standing girlfriend of Prince Harry until their split in January 2009. Press reports quote Chelsy's Uncle Paul as saying that although Harry and Chelsy wished to marry, the Royal Family would not allow this because of Chelsy's Zimbabwean connections.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Campbell family reportedly had various business interests, as well as large landholdings in Salisbury and the Chikomba area of the Mashonaland East Province. With the exception of the Pomona Stone Quarry, virtually all of their assets were seized on Alpes Road in Southern Harare, and their holding company listing. Some family members have reportedly moved to the United Kingdom or South Africa.\n\nThe Belfast-born socialite Hazel Crane, naturalised as both a Rhodesian and a South African citizen, made her fortune as a diamond smuggler in the UDI-era Rhodesia. Crane's first husband was in the Rhodesian Army, fighting in the Bush War, when he was killed at the age of 25. Crane then had one child and was pregnant with the couple's second, and turned to a life of crime after his death. Her activities included smuggling diamonds and emeralds, making blackmarket currency deals, owning a striptease joint and selling hard-core pornography. In her biography, which appeared after her unexplained death, she describes how she would tuck emeralds into her beehive hairdo or pack them into her son's nappies for smuggling. Crane invested her profits in legitimate businesses such as the Copa Cobana restaurant, one of Rhodesia's most popular and fashionable meeting places. In later life, she was a commodity broker.\n\nThe political environment in Zimbabwe has allowed the development of an exploitative business culture, in which some white businessmen have played a prominent role. When Zimbabwe was subject to EU sanctions, arising from its involvement in the DRC from 1998, the government was able to call on sanctions-busting expertise and personnel from the UDI era to provide parts and munitions for its force of Hawk jets. After 25 years of ZANU-PF government, Zimbabwe has become a congenial place for white millionaires of a certain kind to live and do business in.\n\nIn recent years there has been a surge in violence against the dwindling white community and particularly against white farmers. On 18 September 2010, droves of white people were chased away from participating in the constitutional outreach programme in Harare at the weekend, in which violence and confusion marred the process with similar incidents occurring in Graniteside. In Mount Pleasant, white families were subjected to a torrent of abuse by suspected Zanu PF supporters who later drove them away shouting racial slurs. There have also been many illegal seizures of farm land owned by white farmers by the government and government supporters. By March 2000, little land had been redistributed as per the land reform laws that began in 1979, when the Lancaster House Agreement between Britain and Zimbabwe pledged to begin a fairer distribution of land between the white minority, who governed Zimbabwe from 1890 to 1979, and the black population.\n\nHowever at this stage, land acquisition could only occur on a voluntary basis. Little land had been redistributed and frustrated groups of government supporters began seizing white-owned farms. Most of the seizures have taken place in Nyamandhalovu and Inyati. After the beating to death of a prominent farmer in September 2011, the head of the Commercial Farmers' Union decried the attack saying its white members continue to be targeted by violence without protection from the government. Genocide Watch has declared the violence against whites in Zimbabwe a stage 5 case. In September 2014, Mugabe publicly declared that all white Zimbabweans should \"go back to England\" and called for black Zimbabweans not to lease agricultural land to white farmers.\n\nSeveral cultural organisations existed during white-minority rule that mainly served the interests of the community. These included The National Gallery, The National Arts Foundation and the Salisbury Arts Council.\n\nArtistic expression often portrays \"the melancholy white exile\" from Zimbabwe who secretly longs to return home.\n\nNobel Prize-winning writer Doris Lessing, who lived in Southern Rhodesia between 1924 and 1949 and had two children there, published works about the colonial experience and exposing racial hostilities. Her 1950 novel, \"The Grass Is Singing\", is set in Southern Rhodesia in the late 1940s and deals with racial injustice. The book was banned in Southern Rhodesia until independence in 1980. She visited her children in the country in 1956 but was declared a \"prohibited immigrant\" and banned from returning for political reasons. She visited the country many times after independence and published her accounts of the visits in the book \"African Laughter: Four Visits to Zimbabwe\" in 1992. In her 2008 semi fictional/non-fiction novel \"Alfred and Emily\", Southern Rhodesia is a prominent backdrop in the second \"factual\" part of her account of her parents' lives.\n\nPeter Godwin (born Salisbury (now Harare), 1957) wrote several books with a Zimbabwean background including \"Rhodesians Never Die\" (1984) and \"When a Crocodile Eats the Sun\" (2007). The theme of these books is the impact of political change in Zimbabwe on the country's white community. Godwin regularly contributes to newspapers, TV and radio on Zimbabwean affairs. Godwin's writing appears much affected by the death of one of his sisters in a \"friendly fire\" incident during the Bush War in the 1970s. Another sibling, Georgina Godwin, was until 2001 a presenter on Zimbabwe TV and radio. Douglas Rogers has also enjoyed success chronicling his parents struggle to hold onto their game farm and backpackers resort in \"The Last Resort\". In 2010 the book won the British Guild of Travel Writers award for Best Narrative Travel Book.\n\nCatherine Buckle has also tackled the issue of chaotic land reforms. Her books are \"African Tears\" and \"Beyond Tears\". The former deals with the emotional struggle that she and her family faced as war veterans invaded her farm. She also explores the traumatic situation facing farm workers and other farming families in similar positions to hers. In \"Beyond Tears\" she speaks to the family of a murdered farmer, to five farmers who were abducted as well as to rape victims. She also returns to visit her once-productive farm, which has been burnt to the ground and turned into a squatter camp.\n\nSouth Africa-born novelist and poet John Eppel was raised in Southern Rhodesia and is a Zimbabwean citizen. His works have been released to critical acclaim; in particular, he has enjoyed success with \"D G G Berry's The Great North Road\".In particular he deals with themes such as the Rhodesian Bush War, independence and neo-colonialism.\n\nThe late Heidi Holland (1947–2012) was the former editor of \"Illustrated Life Rhodesia\" under her married name, Heidi Hull. She later wrote for \"The Sunday Times\", \"The New York Times\" and \"The Telegraph\". Her final book \"Dinner With Mugabe\" (2008) gained significant media attention and allowed a rare insight into Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.\n\nAlexandra Fuller wrote of her childhood in the 1970s on a farm in \"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\", which won the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize in 2002, was a New York Times Notable Book for 2002 and a finalist for \"The Guardian\"'s First Book Award. \"Scribbling the Cat\" (2004) recounted a return journey as an adult, travelling with a troubled ex-soldier, attempting to lay childhood ghosts to rest. It won the Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage in 2006. Lauren Liebenberg's also centred her debut novel, \"The Voluptuous Delights of Peanut Butter and Jam\" on a Rhodesian farm in 1978. It was later nominated for the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2008. Liebenberg drew upon some of her own experiences as a child growing up in war-torn Rhodesia.\n\nAlexander McCall Smith, who was born and brought up in Southern Rhodesia, has also enjoyed success. In particular he is known as the creator of the Africa-inspired series The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency set in neighbouring Botswana.\n\nIn particular patriotic folk songs were popular amongst the white community during the Rhodesian Bush War. A leading musical figure was Clem Tholet, who married Ian Smith's stepdaughter Jean Smith in 1967. In particular Tholet became famous for patriotic anthems such as \"Rhodesians Never Die\". He enjoyed gold status (60,000+) with his first album \"Songs Of Love & War\".\n\nAnother popular folk singer was Northern Rhodesian-born John Edmond and former soldier of the (Southern) Rhodesian Army, who also enjoyed considerable success during the Rhodesian Bush War. In particular he had hits with patriotic folk songs such as 'The U.D.I. Song' from his popular \"Troopiesongs\" album.\n\nConcert pianist Manuel Bagorro (born Salisbury, 1968) is the founder and artistic director of The Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA). First held in 1999, the Festival was most recently held in April 2008 and was successful in attracting attention to the arts in Zimbabwe at a difficult time. Bagorro's audio diary of the Festival, set against the background of the 2008 elections, was broadcast in instalments by the BBC World Service. The theme of HIFA was \"north meets south\" with contributions from African and European cultures.\n\nCape Town-based white Zimbabwean Simon Attwell is a band member of the popular South African group Freshlyground, playing the flute, mbira, sax, and harmonica. Freshlyground combines both African and European musical traditions. Freshlyground participated in the 2008 HIFA.\n\nThe jazz composer, bandleader, and trombonist Mike Gibbs was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. Other internationally successful artists born there include the Royal Ballet prima ballerina Dame Merle Park and actress Susan Burnet, whose grandfather was one of the country's first white settlers.\n\nTheatre was immensely popular across African colonies amongst bourgeoise white residents, often seeking the culture of European metropoles. The construction of larger theatres boomed in the twentieth century in colonies most populated by white people, such as Kenya, Southern Rhodesia and the copper belt of Northern Rhodesia. 'Little theatres' were also popular; often they were part of large sporting venues, gymkhana and turf clubs. In 1910 one author remarked on the popularity of theatre amongst Southern Rhodesia's white population: \"the local population must have spent a considerable amount on theatre seats. Fifteen professional companies went on tour that year.\" Theatres in Southern African colonies were usually situated next to a railway line. The premier European dramatic performance in then Southern Rhodesia took place in the southern region of Bulawayo. The development of rail infrastructure allowed the involvement of entertainers from neighbouring South Africa.\n\nThe National Theatre Organisation, formerly The National Theatre Foundation, focussed on Euro-centric theatre productions. These included plays such as \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"No Sex Please, We're British\".\n\nAn aspiring white Zimbabwean actor and playwright is Scott Sparrow; the 25-year-old Rhodes University drama graduate has been in several South African theatre productions as well as Zimbabwean productions when he was younger. In 2006, at the age of 23, he wrote his first play \"Performers' Travel Guide\", staged at the Intimate Theatre. Sparrow plays 17 characters in the one-man play concerning the disappearance of a woman's child ten years earlier. Along with South African veteran theatre-maker Nicholas Ellenbogen, he was invited to put on a play for the King of Venda. Sparrow directed the play titled \"African Dream Salon\" for the King.\n\nDoris Lessing's Southern Rhodesia novel \"The Grass is Singing\" was adapted into a film by a Swedish company and released in 1981. Despite the majority of the original novel taking place in then Southern Rhodesia and earlier scenes in South Africa, the adaptation was filmed in Zambia and Sweden. The film stars Karen Black and John Thaw as the poverty-stricken white farming couple Mary and Dick Turner and John Kani as the black houseboy and love-interest of Mary Turner. \"The Grass is Singing\" (film) is also known under the titles of \"Gräset Sjunger\" (Swedish) and \"Killing Heat\".\n\nA recent portrayal of a white Zimbabwean was by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2006 film \"Blood Diamond\". He plays the lead fictional character of Danny Archer, an ex-mercenary, diamond-smuggler and self-proclaimed \"Rhodesian\" whose parents were murdered on their farm by rebels. The adventure drama film is set in 1999 during the Sierra Leone Civil War.\n\nAnother prominent performance was by Nicole Kidman in the 2005 film \"The Interpreter\", the final film by celebrated director Sydney Pollack. Kidman plays the lead of Silvia Broome, a white African and New York-based United Nations interpreter raised in the fictional African republic of Matobo. The film centres on the pending visit of the President of Matobo to address the UN in New York; Broome's parents and sister have been killed earlier by a land mine leading to their farm, and soon her brother is murdered in Matobo. There has been much speculation that Matabo is symbolic of Zimbabwe. Its flag bears a striking resemblance to the Zimbabwean one, and there really is a Matobo National Park in Zimbabwe. There are also striking parallels between Matabo's history and that of Zimbabwe. The president of Matobo is presented in a manner similar to the President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, for example by referring to him as the \"teacher\", a nickname shared by Mugabe, in reference to his teaching career. The striking parallels between Matobo and Zimbabwe provoked a reaction from the Zimbabwean government; Acting Information Minister Chen Chimutengwende said the film had \"obvious connections\" and that the Hollywood film was part of a \"CIA plot\" to discredit the Southern African nation.\n\nThe 1980 film \"Shamwari\", also known as \"Chain Gang Killings\" in the United States, is an action thriller about two escaped prisoners, one black, one white and their developing friendship. The film was set and filmed in Rhodesia and several local white actors starred, such as Tamara Franke in the role of Tracy. Four years later Franke had a major role in \"Go for Gold\".\nIn 1960 television was introduced into the then Southern Rhodesia. It was the first such service in the region, as South Africa did not introduce television until 1976 due to the potential ideological conflicts that it posed. The Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC) TV was a commercial service carrying advertising, although there was also a television licence fee. Television reception was confined mainly to the large cities, and the majority of television personalities and viewers were from the white minority. The RBC used the BBC as a model in that a government department was not responsible for it, but a board of governors (selected by Ian Smith) were instead. Popular television shows included \"Kwizzkids\", \"Frankly Partridge\" and \"Music Time\". Possibly the best-known Director of the RBC was Dr. Harvey Ward. Prior to the introduction of television, RBC had developed a successful radio network, which continued. By 1978, three top white executives had fled overseas, including Dr. Ward who \"probably more than any other person, became identified with the right-wing bias on Rhodesia's radio and TV networks.\" The RBC was later succeeded by the Zimbabwe Rhodesia Corporation and later in its present form as the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation. The character Horace Von Khute, from the British television series \"Fonejacker\" is a Rhodesian who works for the police in intercepting a Ugandan bank scammer.\n\nUntil her departure in 2001, Georgina Godwin, the sister of author Peter Godwin, was a celebrity DJ for the corporation and television personality, and also described by Britain's \"The Guardian\" newspaper as Zimbabwe's Sara Cox. She previously held a morning drive-time show and gossip column in Zimbabwe. Most recently she was involved in the London-based SW Radio Africa, a station with a purpose of broadcasting independent of Zimbabwean state interference. Godwin has conducted various powerful interviews for the station with figures such as Desmond Tutu and Zanu-PF firebrand Jocelyn Chiwenga.\n\nIn 2009, the documentary film \"Mugabe and the White African\" premiered at the London Film Festival to rave reviews. The film deals with a white Zimbabwean farming family working against Mugabe's draconian land reform policies.\n\nBefore 1980, Rhodesian representation in international sporting events was almost exclusively white. Zimbabwean participation in some international sporting events continued to be white dominated until well into the 1990s. For example, no black player was selected for the Zimbabwean cricket team until 1995. Rally driver Conrad Rautenbach (son of Billy, see above) won the FIA African Championship scoring Dunlop Zimbabwe Challenge Rally in 2005 and 2006. An iconic event is the all-white Zimbabwean women's field hockey team, captained by Ann Grant (formerly Ann Fletcher), winning gold medals at the Moscow Olympics in July 1980 (Ann Grant's brother, cricketer Duncan Fletcher, later became manager of the England cricket team). An exception to this trend during the 1960s and 1970s was in association football, where the national team was predominantly black, with the notable exceptions of the white forward Bobby Chalmers, who captained the team during its unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the 1970 World Cup, and goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar.\n\nAs of 2007, a large number of Zimbabwe's most famous athletes are white. In tennis, the Black family of Cara, Byron and Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett are notable doubles players. In the 1990s, Zimbabwe's largely white cricket team was a strong one and included world class players such as Andy Flower, Grant Flower and several others. Today Zimbabwe's National Cricket Team still has several white players including Brendan Taylor and Sean Williams. Also, Zimbabwe's most successful recent Olympic athlete is swimmer Kirsty Coventry, who won three medals (including gold) at the 2004 Summer Olympics and four medals (including gold) at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Famous white Zimbabwean golfers include Nick Price, Mark McNulty and Brendon de Jonge.\n\nAlthough she represents South Africa, Rhodesian-born Charlene Wittstock, who was brought up in Bulawayo until moving to South Africa at the age of ten, has achieved success as a swimmer. She has also become a celebrity figure, due to her marriage with Prince Albert II Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\n\nAustralian rugby union player David Pocock is also a well-known Zimbabwean, having emigrated to Australia in 2002.\n\nDuring the UDI era, Rhodesia developed a siege economy as the means of withstanding UN sanctions. The country operated a strict system of exchange and import controls, while major export items were channelled through state trade agencies (such as 'the Grain Marketing Board'). This approach was continued until around 1990, at which time International Monetary Fund and World Bank development funding was made conditional upon the adoption of economic liberalisation. In 1991 Zimbabwe adopted ESAP (Economic Structural Adjustment Programme) which required privatisation, the removal of exchange and import controls, trade deregulation and the phasing out of export subsidies. Up to the time of independence, the economy relied mainly on the export of a narrow range of primary products including tobacco, asbestos and gold. In the post independence period, the world markets for all these products deteriorated and it was hoped that ESAP would facilitate diversification.\n\nESAP and its successor ZIMPREST (Zimbabwe Programme for Economic and Social Transformation) caused considerable economic turbulence. Some sectors of the economy did benefit. But the immediate results included job losses, a rise in poverty, and a series of exchange rate crises. The associated economic downturn caused the budget deficit to rise which put pressure on public services. The means used to finance the budget deficit have caused hyperinflation. These factors created a situation in which many bright and qualified Zimbabweans (both black and white) had to look abroad for work opportunities. Zimbabwean politics since 1990 have therefore been conducted against a background of economic difficulty with the manufacturing sector (in particular) being 'hollowed out'. Although, some parts of the economy continue to perform well. The Zimbabwe stock exchange and the property market have experienced minor booms, while outsiders are coming to invest in both mining and land operations. Where some see crisis, others see opportunity.\n\nIn the period immediately after independence, some white political leaders (such as Ian Smith) sought to maintain the identity of white Zimbabweans as a separate group. In particular, they sought to maintain a separate \"white roll\" for the election of 20 seats in parliament reserved for white people (abolished in 1987). Despite this, many white Zimbabweans embraced the political changes and many even joined Zanu-PF in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, Timothy Stamps served as Minister of Health in the Zimbabwean government from 1986 to 2002.\n\nMore recently, an elite network of white businessmen and senior military officers has been associated with a faction of ZANU-PF identified with Emmerson Mnangagwa, formerly Security Minister and later Speaker of Parliament. Mnangagwa has been described as \"the richest politician in Zimbabwe\". He is believed to have favoured the early retirement of President Mugabe and a conciliatory approach towards the regime's domestic opponents. This line has displeased other elements in ZANU-PF. In June 2006, John Bredenkamp (a prominent former Mnangagwa associate) fled Zimbabwe in his private jet after government investigations into the affairs of his Breco trading company were started. Bredenkamp returned to Zimbabwe in September 2006 after his passport was returned by court order.\n\nIn July 2002, 92 prominent Zimbabweans were subject to EU \"smart sanctions\" intended to express disapproval of various Zimbabwe government policies. These persons were banned from the EU and access to assets they own in the EU was frozen. 91 of those on the blacklist were black and 1 was white. The sole white was Dr. Timothy Stamps.\n\nMany observers found the EU's treatment of Dr. Stamps to be curious, given that by July 2002 he was retired from active politics and a semi-invalid. Also, Stamps was widely rated to be a highly dedicated doctor who had never been implicated in any form of wrongdoing. The same observers found it equally curious that the EU Commission did not include the wealthy white backers of Mugabe on the list.\n\nFrom around 1990 onwards, mainstream white opinion favoured opposition politics to that of Robert Mugabe's ZANU party's control of government. White Zimbabweans sought to vote for liberal economics, democracy and the rule of law. White people had lain low in the immediate post-independence period, but, in 1999 they recognised a common disquiet with the majority of people over ZANU excesses in government, and gave whites an opportunity to vote for the opposition in the country which initially grew out of the trade union movements that were enabling people to have a voice and vote with the majority of Zimbabwe.\n\nRoy Bennett, a white farmer forced off his coffee plantation after it was overrun by radical militants and then expropriated, won a strong victory in the Chimanimani constituency (adjoining the Mozambican border) in the 2000 general election. Bennett (a former Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe member) won his seat for the Movement for Democratic Change, and was one of four white MDC constituency MPs elected in 2000.\n\nOther white MPs elected in 2000 included David Coltart (a prominent human rights lawyer and founding legal secretary of the MDC) and Michael Auret (a civil rights activist of long standing who had opposed white minority rule in the 1970s). Trudy Stevenson was a white American who had lived in Uganda until 1972, before fleeing from the regime of Idi Amin. Stevenson served as the MDC's Secretary for Policy and Research before being elected to Parliament. In July 2006, after attending a political meeting in the Harare suburb of Mabvuku, Mrs Stevenson was attacked and suffered panga wounds to the back of her neck and head. The MDC leadership immediately claimed that the attack was carried out by ZANU militants. But, while recovering in hospital, the MP for Harare North positively identified her assailants as members of a rival faction of the MDC. This serves to illustrate the violent and faction ridden nature of Zimbabwean politics. Zimbabwean politicians (black and white) routinely accuse each other of murder, theft, electoral fraud, conspiracy and treason. It is often difficult to know the truth of these matters.\n\nOne MDC spokesmen is Eddie Cross. Cross is a leading Zimbabwean business figure and serves as the MDC's Economic Secretary and shadow finance minister. Although critical of the ZANU-PF government,Cross has been an advocate of the economic liberalisation that the government has introduced.\n\nThe 2000 general election was arguably the most significant event in post-independence Zimbabwean politics. It was the first seriously contested election in the country since 1962 and was fought out against a background of intractable economic, social and political problems. The ZANU ruling party had been in power for 20 years and was widely considered to have run out of ideas. White people played a leading role in the campaign of the opposition MDC which almost won the election. Radical elements in the country perceived the MDC project to have been an attempt to restore a limited form of white minority rule and this produced a violent backlash.\n\nSince 2000, there has been an increasing sense by the White Zimbabwean community that the rule of law has been selectively applied to crimes committed on members of Zimbabwe's White community.\n\nWhite emigration – particularly from within the farming community – picked up speed again after 2000. There is a link between the recent economic decline in Zimbabwe and White emigration. There has also been an enormous rise in Black emigration during the same period.\n\nThe Independence constitution contained a provision requiring the Zimbabwean government to honour pension obligations due former servants of the Rhodesian state. This obligation included payment in foreign currency to pensioners living outside Zimbabwe (almost all White). Pension payments were made until the 1990s, but they then became erratic and stopped altogether in 2003.\n\nWhite communities in African countries suffered a variety of fates in the post-colonial period. In some countries (e.g. Kenya, Namibia, and Botswana) the White communities survived and actually increased in number. In two particular cases, Algeria and Zimbabwe, the previously large European communities have shrunk. In both these last cases, the White communities had put up a fight against decolonisation and many White people found it difficult to adjust to the realities of the world they found themselves in after independence. Many neutral observers feel that the failure of some newly independent African countries and their White minorities to come to terms with one another was to the mutual disadvantage of both parties. For example, expatriate White farmers and hoteliers from Zimbabwe have done much to revive agriculture and develop tourism in neighbouring Zambia.\n\nThe White community has also recently been the targets of a campaign by the Zimbabwean State media. Several state newspapers have referred to White Zimbabweans as \"Britain's Children\" and \"settlers and colonialists\".\n\nIn 2006, several residents (including British aristocrats) of the predominantly wealthy White Harare suburb of Borrowdale were evicted from their homes because of their proximity to Mugabe's new home in the suburb. In 2007, the exclusive suburb hit the headlines again when news emerged that 100 mainly White youths were arrested during a raid in the suburb's Glow Nightclub, and were transported in two police buses and detained in the downtown central police station. According to eyewitnesses, several of the youths were attacked by Zimbabwean police. In 2008, The Guardian reported on the increasingly hostile situation that the urban White community were facing in Zimbabwe.\n\nIn March 2008, Zimbabweans took part in the Parliamentary and Presidential elections. High-profile White Zimbabwean candidates in these elections included David Coltart for the Senate and Trudy Stevenson, Eddie Cross, and Ian Kay for the House of Assembly – all of these running for one of the Movement for Democratic Change factions (MDC-T) or (MDC-M). Coltart, Cross, and Kay were all elected, while Stevenson failed to take the Mount Pleasant seat in Harare for the Mutumbara faction of the MDC.\n\nThe MDC won both the Parliamentary and Presidential elections. On 16 September 2008, the formation of a new \"unity\" government was agreed with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai as Prime Minister. Senator Roy Bennett was nominated to be Minister of Lands, Agriculture, and Resettlement while Eddie Cross was nominated to be Minister of International Trade.\n\nIn February 2009, \"The Times\" reported on the struggles the White community faces today, citing the struggle to afford food and the astronomical price of private healthcare, and reporting that most White residents in Zimbabwe were financially dependent on relatives abroad.\n\nIn the same month, the UK Government confirmed that it would assist elderly British citizens living in Zimbabwe to resettle in the United Kingdom. The repatriation plan will focus on Britons over seventy years of age and younger Britons with medical or other problems may also be eligible.\n\nIn February 2010, the international media reported that new government regulations stipulated that all White business owners must sign over a 51% majority share of their business to Black Zimbabweans. A penalty for those that do not comply could result in imprisonment. Most recently, the law has been abandoned pending further discussion.\n\nIn March 2010, a group of dispossessed White farmers were handed the ownership documents of a valuable property in Cape Town owned by the Zimbabwean government by a South African court. The South African court had earlier ruled that land grabs in Zimbabwe were unlawful and that property owned by the Zimbabwean government (and not protected by diplomatic immunity) could be seized as compensation for victims of the land grabs. It is anticipated that other assets, such as Air Zimbabwe jets in South Africa, could be seized.\n\nThe charity Zane (\"Zimbabwe, a National Emergency\") was established in 2002. The charity helps to facilitate the repatriation of cash-strapped British passport holders resident in Zimbabwe. , it continues to support 1,800 White Zimbabweans, while also providing support to wider Zimbabwean society.\n\nIn 2017, new President Emmerson Mnangagwa promised to pay compensation to the White farmers whose land was seized during the land reform programme on his inaugural speech. Rob Smart became the first White farmer whose land was returned within a month after President Mnangagwa was sworn in to office, he returned to his farm in Manicaland province by military escort. During World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos, Mnangagwa also stated that his new government believes that thinking about racial lines in farming and land ownership is \"outdated\" and should be \"philosophy of the past.\"\n\n"}

Her voice was known for its power and extension used in operatic roles such as Turandot in a career spanning four decades.\n\nGhena Dimitrova was born in the Bulgarian village of Beglezh, some 25 km from Pleven, in 1941. She started singing in the school choir and her powerful voice led to her being offered a place at the Sofia Conservatory studying under Christo Brambarov between 1959 and 1964. While she was initially classified as a mezzo-soprano, she was recognised as a soprano in her second year.\n\nAfter finishing her studies at the Sofia Conservatory, she started teaching singing. Her breakthrough came in 1967 as Abigaille in a Bulgarian National Opera production of Giuseppe Verdi's \"Nabucco\" after a couple of other sopranos dropped out. In the early recordings Dimitrova's voice had not yet reached its signature size, and in many of the early Nabucco productions, the final optional high C is omitted in the cabaletta, \"Salgo già\", which she would include later in her career.\n\nDimitrova won the Sofia International Singing Competition in 1970, the prize including a course of study at La Scala's Scuola di Perfezionamento.\n\nShe made her Italian debut as Turandot in Treviso in 1975, and essayed the same role for her 1983 La Scala debut opposite tenor Plácido Domingo in Franco Zeffirelli's lavish production. She also sang at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1974-75, where she sang Tosca, Turandot, Andrea Chenier, Il trovatore and Don Carlo. Her Turandot is also preserved in a video of the Arena di Verona production from 1983, with Nicola Martinucci and Cecilia Gasdia. In 1988, she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York performing the same role.\n\nDimitrova once said of the role: \"Turandot may not be my favorite part, but it shows off the voice to great advantage. The way the music is written, you need a voice like a trumpet to do it justice.\"\n\nHer debut in the United States was in 1981 performing the role of Elvira in \"Ernani\". She sang at the Barbican Arts Centre in Ponchielli's \"La Gioconda\" in 1983 before making her Covent Garden debut in the same year. Her late debut she later attributed simply to \"politics\".\n\nAfter retiring from the stage in 2001, Dimitrova remained active working with young singers. One of her best students is the soprano Elena Baramova.\n\nDimitrova died in Milan on 11 June 2005. After her death the Bulgarian Government promised to establish a fund in her name for promising young singers.\n\nDimitrova Peak in Antarctica is named after Ghena Dimitrova.\n\n\n"}

Its role, rank and authority varied throughout the pre-Meiji period of Japanese history, but in general remained as a significant post under the Taihō Code.\n\nThe office of \"Naidaijin\" predated the Taihō Code of 701. Fujiwara no Kamatari was the first person appointed to the post in 669. After the appointment of Fujiwara no Michitaka in 989, the office became permanently established, ranking just below that of \"Udaijin\" (\"Right Minister\") and \"Sadaijin\" (\"Left Minister\"). \n\nThe office developed a different character in the Meiji period. In 1885, the title was reconfigured to mean the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan in the Imperial Court. In that year, the office of prime minister or chief minister of the initial restoration government was the \"Daijō-daijin\", Sanjō Sanetomi. In December, Sanjō petitioned the emperor to be relieved of his office; and he was then immediately appointed \"Naidaijin\", or Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal.\n\nThe office of the Privy Seal was identical with the old \"Naidaijin\" only in the sense of the Japanese title—not in terms of function or powers.\n\nThe nature of the office further evolved in the Taishō and Shōwa periods.

He is currently serves as the New York Islanders' director of pro scouting. A member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, he played 550 regular season games in the National Hockey League between 1980 and 1989.\n\nKen Morrow was born in Flint and grew up in the nearby town of Davison, Michigan. He is a graduate of Davison High School.\nMorrow attended Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio where he was a star defenseman and also represented Team USA at the 1978 Ice Hockey World Championship. His best year as a college player was in 1979 when he was named Central Collegiate Hockey Association player of the year.\n\nThe following season, Morrow played for the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team that beat the Soviet team in an event known as the \"Miracle on Ice\" during the 1980 Winter Olympics before defeating Finland to win the gold medal.\n\nSelected 68th overall in the 1976 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Islanders, Morrow joined the Islanders immediately after the Olympics. He helped them win their first Stanley Cup in 1980, making him the first player to win the Olympic Gold and an NHL championship in one season. He was an integral member of all four Islanders Stanley Cup teams in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983; furthermore, although Morrow was never a goal-scorer, during the playoffs the Isles often benefited from his clutch goal scoring at key times. Morrow also returned to the United States national team for the 1981 Canada Cup tournament.\n\nDuring the 1980 and 1983 playoffs, Morrow had arthroscopic surgeries performed to his knees, and played only days afterward in order to contribute to the Islanders championships, often having fluid drained from his knees between games. He was eventually forced to retire prematurely from the game in 1988–89 due to constant knee problems.\n\nMorrow, who was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1995, has been director of pro scouting for the Isles since 1993. He remains employed in this position despite the fact that a large amount of Islanders draft picks have never panned out. He previously served as the Islanders' assistant coach for one season, in 1991–92. He was also co-coach of the International Hockey League's Kansas City franchise in 1990–91 and assistant coach of the IHL Flint Spirits in 1989–90 shortly after retiring from hockey. On December 31, 2011, Morrow was inducted into the New York Islanders Hall of Fame.\nKen Morrow is also President of KCIce, an Outdoor Ice Rink Development and Management company in Kansas City, MO.\n\nIn the 1981 TV movie about the 1980 gold medal-winning U.S. Hockey team called \"Miracle on Ice\", he is played by Scott Feraco.\n\nMorrow was portrayed by actor Casey Burnette in the 2004 Disney movie \"Miracle\". Before the movie, Burnette played junior hockey for the Barrie Colts in the Ontario Hockey League, the Hull Olympiques (now called the Gatineau Olympiques) and the Montreal Rocket, both in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. Bizarrely he was not depicted with his trademark beard in the movie despite this almost being an issue for Coach Herb Brooks. Brooks specifically made a rule to allow Morrow to keep his beard for the team, based on his having a beard prior to joining the team.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2027805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027805", "title": "Pack hunter", "text": "Pack hunter\n\nA pack hunter or social predator is a predatory animal which hunts its prey by working together with other members of its species. Normally animals hunting in this way are closely related, and with the exceptions of chimpanzees where only males normally hunt, all individuals in a family group contribute to hunting. When hunting cooperation is across two or more species, the broader term cooperative hunting is commonly used.\n\nA well known pack hunter is the gray wolf; humans too can be considered pack hunters. Other pack hunting mammals include chimpanzees, dolphins, lions, dwarf and banded mongooses and spotted hyenas. Avian social predators include the Harris's hawk, butcherbirds, three of four kookaburra species and many helmetshrikes. There are a few cold-blooded pack hunters including simple arthropods such as army ants, the goldsaddle goatfish and occasionally crocodiles.\n\nSome non-avian theropod dinosaurs may have displayed pack behaviour.\n\nPack hunting is typically associated with cooperative breeding and its concentration in the Afrotropical Region is a reflection of this. Most pack hunters are found in the southern African savannas, with a notable absence in tropical rainforests and with the exception of the wolf and coyote, higher latitudes. It is thought that either on the ancient and poor soils of the southern African savanna it is not possible for individual predators to find adequate food, or that the environment's inherent unpredictability due to ENSO or IOD events means that in very bad conditions it will not be possible to raise the young necessary to prevent declining populations from adult mortality. It is also argued that Africa's large area of continuous flat and open country, which was even more extensive while rainforest contracted during glacial periods of the Quaternary, may have helped encourage pack hunting to become much more common than on any other continent.\n\n80-95% of carnivores are solitary and hunt alone; the others including lions, wild dogs, spotted hyenas, chimpanzees, and humans hunt cooperatively, at least some of the time. Cooperative hunting has also been documented in birds of prey and large marine vertebrates such as groupers and moray eels. Cooperative hunting has been linked to the social organization of animal species and the evolution of sociality and thus provides a unique perspective to study group behavior.\n\nUnderstanding how cooperative hunting could evolve requires considering the circumstances that would make it beneficial.\n\nIn 1988 the ecologists Craig Packer and Lore Ruttan surveyed documented instances of cooperative hunting to make a game-theoretical model to explain under what circumstances cooperative hunting might evolve. In their model, individuals can engage in one of four hunting strategies:\n\nEach of these strategies has a certain efficiency based on the size and number of prey that can be captured in a hunt.\n\nThe model shows that cooperative hunting for a single large prey is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)—a strategy that an individual adopts because failure to do so reduces its fitness—only when solitary hunting is much less efficient. This is usually due to a prey species being too large to be taken down by a single individual predator, meaning hunting efficiency is low and hunting cost is high. In this case, the increased benefit in hunting efficiency from cooperation must compensate for the division of available meat among cooperators. Furthermore, cooperatively hunting groups are prone to invasion by cheaters and scavengers who avoid the drawbacks of hunting, so the added benefit of cooperative hunting must also outweigh these costs. Otherwise, cheating and scavenging can also be evolutionarily stable strategies. The proportion of these strategies increases in larger groups, since only a certain number of individuals are required to help make the kill, allowing others to directly benefit without participating in the hunt.\n\nWhen a species hunts a single prey small enough to be monopolized by an individual, cooperative hunting is rarely ever an ESS, since group members in essence all compete for a single meal. Unless individual prey-tracking and capture-efficiency is extremely low, solitary hunting is always the dominant strategy, since solitaries don't have to share their kill. Cheaters and scavengers never prosper in this situation, since the original captor monopolizes all the food. The model predicts that the only way cooperative hunting is an ESS for single small prey is if the predators are already constrained to live in groups—so they must share what they get in order to keep the group stable.\n\nOn the other hand, cooperative hunting is always an ESS when attacking multiple prey, both large and small. This is because cooperators no longer have to pay costs of dividing meat if they can each make their own kill. Another benefit is that when prey is sufficiently large it can be shared among cooperators if one member was unable to make a kill. Moreover, cheaters and scavengers only do well when hunting costs are very high, since they forgo the chance to get their own prey. In these parts of the model, cooperative hunting is always favorable, as long as there is some form of increase in net efficiency over solitary hunting. However, in their body of research, Packer and Ruttan found very few instances of this clear advantage over solitaries. They concluded that cooperative hunting in multiple-prey situations is more likely to be a result of pre-existing social bonds rather than an evolutionary adaptation, but that this hunting behavior is still important for establishing the social fabric of the group.\n\nIn 1994 Christophe Boesch condensed Packer and Ruttan's model to two basic conditions and added a crucial third component based on his study of chimpanzees (\"Pan troglodytes\") in the Taï National Park of Cote d'Ivoire:\n\n\nCuriously, among female Taï chimpanzees, cheating has become an ESS because there are substantially more costs associated with hunting, including the risk of dropping infants from trees and injuring them. Therefore, it pays females to be bystanders rather than hunt; in fact, the male strategy allows the female strategy to be stable provided the males provision their female partners with food.\n\nOn the other hand, in the chimpanzees of Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, cooperative hunting is not a stable strategy. The predator-prey interactions differ in Gombe chimpanzees in a way that has prevented cooperative hunting from evolving. Both Taï and Gombe chimps hunt small red colobus monkeys that live in trees; however, the trees are much smaller at Gombe, such that it is very easy for one chimp to capture its prey. At Taï, the trees are much taller (by about 30–40 meters), and it thus takes a larger effort to capture the prey. This disparity in height would favor the evolution of cooperative hunting at Taï (where multiple chimps can help one another out), but not at Gombe (where the benefits of cooperative hunting do not outweigh the costs of meat-sharing). In fact, single hunters gain much more meat than cooperative hunters in the Gombe population. It is therefore plausible that cooperative hunting evolved at Taï as a response to the more difficult distribution of monkeys in taller trees.\n\nThe results above suggest that social living in chimps may not be a necessary prerequisite for the evolution of cooperative hunting; instead, the distribution of resources is a critical determining factor.\n\nThe distribution of prey species is often the determining factor for whether populations hunt cooperatively. When prey is abundant throughout a habitat, cooperative hunting is not an effective strategy. Solitary hunters can easily find food on their own and do not share their kill. This case arises when prey is small enough to be captured by an individual. In contrast, when patches of prey are focused in small areas of a habitat, predators are likely to live in groups, to coordinate large attacks, and to kill more prey. This strategy illustrates the importance of group living in establishing cooperative hunting efforts. In this respect, cooperative hunting is not just a function of the species, but also of its environment. Consequentially, cooperative hunting most likely evolved in areas with scarce prey distribution, and patterns of this behavior are likely to vary with seasonal fluctuation of available resources.\n\nEven species that normally exhibit solitary hunting behavior have been shown to engage in cooperative hunting when the distribution of prey makes it difficult for solitary hunters to be successful. For example, in aplomado falcons individuals generally hunt alone when searching for insects, as these hunts are simple and these insects are easy to find. However, the aplomado falcons generally hunt cooperatively when targeting smaller rodents and birds, as these hunts are lengthy and require high-speed chases. Thus the switch to hunting cooperatively often depends upon the resource distribution in certain species.\n\nWhen resources are distributed in a way that supports group living, populations may develop social groups. Cooperative hunting is often a major feature of these groups, and it has been theorized that it is a primary basis for the evolution of sociality in the order Carnivora. While alternate theories have concluded that cooperative hunting may not be as important a factor in sociality as territory-sharing and mutual protection of offspring, they still agree that it plays an important role in developing social groups. For example, as a result of cooperative hunting, aplomado falcons defend the nest together and share the food with offspring after the hunt. Cooperative hunting has thus proven to hold certain social groups together since it can be disadvantageous to hunt alone in particular situations. Future research may quantify the contribution of cooperative hunting to the evolution of sociality, as it is currently difficult to ascertain how much cooperative hunting is a cause or a consequence of social behavior.\n\nWhen an environment allows it, cooperative hunting can offer species a range of adaptive advantages not normally available through solitary hunting.\n\nThere are two main goals to cooperative hunting in social carnivores: taking down large prey species through a coordinated effort and subsequently protecting their kill from scavengers. A common goal in cooperatively hunting pairs is to coordinate the separation of a mother and her offspring, facilitating an easier kill that a solitary hunter could not make. Cooperative hunting is also important in species that prey on larger animals, such as African hunting dogs, as it allows them to make a kill in a safer, more efficient manner. After the kill has been made, the hunters restrict meat access to those involved in the hunt to protect their food from scavengers. This includes both strictly scavenging species and members of their own species who do not participate in the hunt. In these ways, cooperative hunting confers adaptive advantages by affording species a means to make more efficient kills and by ensuring they get the maximum amount of food possible from their kill.\n\nAnother advantage of cooperative hunting is that attacking in a group allows more opportunities to make a kill before the prey scatters and gets away. There is also the potential to confuse the prey species so they may run into another hunter approaching from a different direction. Group attacks are particularly advantageous when prey live in concentrated groups, as hunters have a hard time tracking prey in territories outside the preferred habitat.\n\nHigher success in prey capture has been demonstrated in wild dogs, bottlenose dolphins and other cetaceans, falcons, and fossa due to cooperative hunting. For example, aplomado falcons increase their efficiency of capture when hunting in pairs because the pairs are twice as successful as hunting alone. As a result, the high overall success rate of cooperative hunting leads to higher per capita meat intake even in large groups.\n\nMany populations capable of forming cooperative hunting groups may not necessarily do so if their group is too small or too large for this behavior to be favorable. Group size is an important indicator of specific instances of cooperative hunting, as the prey must be large enough and the hunting group small enough to provide enough food for all individuals. Another important consideration is that when groups grow larger, there is a greater chance that individuals will engage in a cheater strategy. If there is consistently too much cheating in a group, individuals will prefer to hunt alone so they do not have to share their meal with freeloaders.\n\nThere may be costs that set an upper limit on group size. The net benefits increase as a function of pack size, as more animals in a group are theoretically able to obtain more meat. However, in African wild dogs, researchers found that the most common group size was not the group size that maximized net benefits. Instead, because larger packs must travel farther to get more food, there are travelling costs associated with larger groups. Thus, African wild dogs optimize a more appropriate currency: the amount of meat gained per dog per kilometer traveled, instead of the amount of meat gained per dog per day as the latter does not take into account the costs of hunting. This research successfully demonstrates that varying ecological variables are responsible for the difference in optimum group size among cooperatively hunting animals.\n\nDivision of labor, with each team member performing a subtask to complete an objective, is found in many species. It has been shown that animals that forage and hunt cooperatively in groups often adopt specialized roles during a hunting event, which can vary widely among different species. Division of labor among cooperatively hunting species occurs along a continuum, ranging from species in which individuals never differentiate into specific roles to species in which individuals specialize into different roles that they always perform throughout their lifetime.\n\nAfrican wild dogs participate in an intense rally ceremony before hunting. Its function is to ensure that all the members are alert and ready to hunt. They then all trot together and participate in a chase during which they pursue and harass the prey. Instead of immediately attacking the prey, which could result in small prey immediately fleeing and large prey forming a defensive pinwheel and charging, the dogs form a defensive formation. Despite their coordinated formation, there is no clear role specialization in this species, as all individuals perform essentially the same function.\n\nCo-operation between wolves in a pack is most visible in their hunting strategy, and is highly effective. A wolf pack may trail a herd of elk, caribou or other large prey for days, looking for an animal that displays any sign of weakness, before making its move. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the pack heads towards the prey, chasing it down and then surrounding it. Once the attack begins the wolves have specific roles in the hunt, based on age, gender and social standing, as well as its particular experience and abilities. The youngest wolves frequently do nothing more than observe and learn from the sidelines. Speedy, lightly built females often take on herding roles, darting back and forth in front of prey, causing confusion and preventing escape. Slower but more powerful males are able to take down a large animal more aggressively and quickly.\n\nAplomado falcons monitor each other's movements during hunts. Males and females always perform the same task in every situation. They begin perched together and the males initiate and give a sharp \"chirp\" vocalization to signal for the female to follow suit. When chasing birds on the ground, the females follow right behind the birds in the bushes and the males swoop in from overhead to make the kill. Within these pairs, males and females are consistently assigned to a particular role.\n\nIndividual role specialization has also been observed in bottlenose dolphins. The bottlenose dolphins form groups of three to six. One dolphin acts as the “driver” and herds the fish in circles towards the “barrier dolphins” who are tightly grouped together to form a barrier. The driver performs fluke-slaps to cause the fish to leap into the air. As the fish begin to leap, the driver moves next to the barrier dolphins, who all catch the fish in the air with their mouths open. Stefanie Gazda and colleagues predict that this role specialization is more common in marine than terrestrial animals due to a higher variability in prey diversity, biomass, and predator mobility in the ocean. One specific type of cooperative feeding behavior is mud ring feeding.\n\nCooperative hunting strategy in lions is based on groups of three to seven individuals split into two highly specialized roles, centers and wings, which coordinate their movement to encircle and ambush the prey. In a line of lions, the outside individuals, also known as the wings, first run out to the sides of the intended target while the center lies in an ambush position. As the wings slowly encircle their mark, they drive the prey towards the waiting center—often one of the older and heavier individuals in the group—who then pounces to make the kill. Each individual in the group learns its preferred role during youth, whether it be center or wing. A child does not necessarily perform the same position as its mother since it learns through observing other lionesses in the pride. Individuals have also been shown to perform positions other than their natural place depending on whether another individual has already filled their role. Despite this plasticity, hunting success is greatest when every individual in the group can perform its specialized role.\n\nIn Taï, chimpanzee, individuals participate as a driver, blocker, chaser, or ambusher. Drivers follow the prey without trying to catch up with it. Blockers place themselves in a tree to block the progression of the prey. Chasers move quickly after the prey to catch up with it. Finally, ambushers anticipate the escape route of the prey long enough in advance to force it back towards the chasers or down into the lower canopy. Blocking and ambushing are thought to require much more cognitive effort in anticipating the future movements of the prey, and they are thus rewarded with a larger proportion of meat after a successful hunt. These two roles correlate positively with the age of the chimpanzee as the cognitive function necessary to perform these tasks is thought to increase with age. Furthermore, individuals can change roles during the same hunt or maintain their same role during the entire process.\n\nFossa (\"Cryptoprocta ferox\") are the first documented example of cooperative hunting in solitary species, as fossa are some of the least social carnivores. The fossa is the largest member of Madagascar euplerids. They are carnivorous, feeding mostly on small lemurs and tenrecs. Prey size may have been important for the evolution of cooperative hunting in fossa because one of their main sources of prey (larger lemurs) has recently gone extinct. Larger lemurs (20-120 pounds), such as giant sloth lemurs, were abundant on Madagascar until 500–1500 years ago. Cooperative hunting was common to take down a prey of this size. However, since extinction was relatively recent, cooperative hunting may have persisted even after their prey size diminished.\n\nStegodyphid spiders (Genus \"Stegodyphus\") have been shown to act cooperatively to trap and collect insect prey species. These social arachnids cooperate both by spinning communal webs on which to catch prey and by moving together to catch large prey in the field, such as grasshoppers. These spiders do not monopolize certain parts of the web, meaning any individual can use a variety of locations to lie in wait for prey. When prey is captured in the field, it usually requires at least two spiders to be brought back to the nest to be shared among the rest of the colony.\n\nResearch at Lamalera village in Indonesia has shown how cooperative hunting can develop in pre-industrial societies. This village relies on traditional whale hunting techniques for its livelihood. Because whale hunting requires more than one individual, it benefits the villagers to hunt cooperatively. The hunting men cooperate either as crew members, corporate members, or craftsmen. Each performs a different duty and receives a different share of whale meat. Alvard echoes other research by suggesting that these shared norms of meat distribution sustains cooperative hunting and prevents the rise of cheaters.\n\nThis research also details the importance of biological relatedness amongst a cooperative hunting group. Kin selection favours traits or behaviours that promote the survival of relatives. At Lamalera, only kin that are of the same lineage (that all descend from male relatives or all descend from female relatives) hunt together. The researchers suggest that this allows an unambiguous identification of the relatedness of other group members.\n\nResearch conducted by Vladmir Dinets has indicated that crocodilians regularly engage in cooperative hunting behavior, including highly organized game drives. Behaviours noted by Dinets include forming tight \"bait balls\" when hunting fish and being able to anticipate the location and actions of other crocodiles without being able to see them for an ambush. Dinets suggests this may make crocodiles some of a small group of animals that can cooperate in such sophisticated ways.\n\nGroupers (\"Plectropomus pessuliferus marisrubri\") and giant moray eels (\"Gymnothorax javanicus\") provide compelling evidence for interspecific cooperative hunting. Groupers visit moray eels at their resting places and provide visual signals (such as a head shake) to engage morays in the hunt. These associations are non-random and appear to be motivated by the hunger level of the groupers. Groupers were able to capture prey five times more quickly with morays present because the eels could sneak through crevices and corner prey items; additionally, morays that hunted alone were never successful because they did not have a grouper present to lead them to the prey. Thus, the hunting success of groupers and giant moray eels is greater for both species than when hunting alone.\n\nCooperative hunting is sometimes thought to reflect advanced cognitive processes, such as foresight, planning, and theory of mind and involve complex communication between hunters. However, several lines of evidence indicate that many instances of cooperative hunting rely on simple principles and can be observed in species without large brains or advanced cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, cooperative hunting occurs at different levels of complexity, and the most advanced levels may reflect a higher level of cognitive ability. In addition, frequent and successful pack hunting may depend on a higher level of social harmony, complexity, or intelligence, which may facilitate concerted group activities. In general, not much data has been collected on this topic, and new technologies and equipment may allow the collection of enough observations to answer these questions.\n\nMany species, including spiders, have been observed to take down prey in groups. However, the mere act of multiple animals killing and sharing prey does not by itself indicate any level of advanced coordination. To differentiate between different levels of cooperative hunting, Boesch & Boesch developed a scheme for categorizing group hunts:\n\n\nA variety of social carnivores, such as wolves, lions, and African wild dogs have been observed to operate at the level of coordination and occasionally collaboration, while some populations of chimps have been observed to collaborate frequently with several distinct roles.\n\nWhile it is easy to attribute complex cognitive processes to animals hunting in a coordinated manner, this apparently complex behaviour may be explained in terms of more simple mental operations. For example, the hunting tactics of wolves, which involve fanning out and encircling prey, are argued to have been replicated in a computer simulation where the wolves were programmed with two simple rules: (1) Get within a minimum safe distance from the prey (2) Once this distance is achieved, move away from hunting partners. Ambushing is also argued to have been represented in this simulation by wolves who begin randomly at different locations. This simulation matches the \"coordination\" level of complexity, leaving open the question of the cognitive processes necessary for \"collaboration\".\n\nAnother argument consists of observations that several animals not usually thought of as cognitively complex have been observed to hunt cooperatively, and in some cases collaboratively. For example, grouper fish have been observed to recruit giant moray eels into collaborative hunts, where their complementary hunting strategies increase the feeding success of both. The gestures performed by the grouper fish fulfill the criteria for a \"referential gesture\", a signalling behaviour previously only observed in humans, great apes, and ravens. In addition, cooperative and collaborative hunting has been observed in other unlikely candidates, such as crocodiles and Cuban boas.\n\nIn contrast to social carnivores, who normally hunt cooperatively and only occasionally take on complementary roles, chimpanzees in Taï National Park regularly hunt collaboratively. They have been observed to use four different specialized roles, including ambushing, blocking, chasing, and driving. Christophe Boesch has argued that this level of collaborative complexity is indicative of several advanced cognitive processes. For example, chimps must successfully attribute physical abilities to their prey and use this information to predict which tree they may reach and when. In addition, chimps require knowledge of their partner's roles and the information they possess about the prey's location in order to infer the direction of the prey and adjust their behaviour accordingly. Finally, chimps take up to 20 years to learn the most complex hunting roles, indicating that these do not operate by simple rules.\n\nEven more advanced than these predictive abilities may be the ability to participate in collaborative activities with shared goals and intentions, which Micheal Tomasello calls \"shared intentionality\". Tomasello claims that this ability involves unique mental representations and a level of cognitive and social complexity only achieved by humans. However, Boesch counters this by pointing out that Taï chimps fulfill all the hallmarks of shared intentionality, bringing into question either the uniqueness or the complexity of this cognitive process.\n\nWhile the majority of group hunting behaviours do not seem to take much cognitive complexity, it has been observed that species that receive a large portion of their food from cooperative hunts tend to have a complex or harmonious social structure. This includes many of the prototypical social carnivores, such as wolves and wild dogs. A harmonious pack structure may allow for the emergence of more frequent cooperative hunts, as group activities and food sharing are facilitated by lower levels of aggression and fear. For example, spotted hyenas have been found to be better at a cooperative problem-solving task with a food reward than chimpanzees. In addition, their performance is modulated by social factors, such as the presence of an audience and the social rank of their partner. Bonobos were likewise found to be better at a cooperative task with a food reward than other, more aggressive chimpanzees.\n\n"}

He was considered the top high school defenseman in Minnesota as a senior in 1977–78. He also attended the U.S. National Junior training camp in summer of 1978 and participated in the 1979 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships while playing at the University of Minnesota.\n\nRamsey was the youngest member of the U.S. team that upset the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, in an event known as the Miracle on Ice. The American team, which went on to defeat Finland for the gold medal, was coached by Herb Brooks, who was Ramsey's coach at the University of Minnesota.\n\nDrafted 11th overall by the Buffalo Sabres in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, Ramsey would go on to play in the National Hockey League immediately after the Olympics. He had one of the most successful NHL careers of the 1980 U.S. Olympians, playing 14 seasons for the Sabres. Primarily known as an offensive defenseman as an amateur, he successfully adapted to the bigger and tougher NHL by becoming a stay-at-home defenseman in Buffalo. Highlights of his career with the Sabres include playing in the NHL All-Star Game four times (1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986) as well as being a member of the NHL All-Star team that played the Soviet national hockey team in Rendez-Vous '87. Ramsey also served as the Sabres' team captain from 1990 to 1992. He continued to play for Team USA during this time, participating in the 1982 Ice Hockey World Championships and the 1984 and 1987 Canada Cup tournaments.\n\nRamsey's old coach in Buffalo, Scotty Bowman, brought him to the Pittsburgh Penguins during the 1992–93 season to shore up the team's defensive corps as it made a run at a third straight Stanley Cup championship. However, the Penguins were upset in the second round by the New York Islanders. After another season in Pittsburgh, Ramsey signed with the Detroit Red Wings, who by now were also coached by Bowman, as a free agent. In April 1995, Ramsey became teammates with defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov when Detroit acquired the latter in a trade with the New Jersey Devils; Fetisov had played for the Soviets during the 1980 Olympics. That year, Ramsey played in his first Stanley Cup Finals series, but the Red Wings were swept by the Devils, who had Ramsey's 1980 Olympic teammate, Neal Broten, on their roster. The next season, the powerful Red Wings set a league record for most wins in a single season with 62, but were ousted in the Western Conference Finals by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche. Ramsey played only two games for Detroit in the 1996-97 season before retiring.\n\nRamsey returned to Minnesota after finishing his NHL career where he ran a sporting goods store named \"Gold Medal Sports\" and played senior league hockey. He returned to the NHL in 1997 to serve as an assistant coach with the Buffalo Sabres, and in 2000 he took a similar position with the Minnesota Wild. He was with the Wild until June 2010.\n\nHe was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nRamsey has three children: Hannah, Rachel and Jack. Hannah is a student at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis. Rachel, who played hockey at Minnetonka High School, plays defense for the University of Minnesota. During the 2011-2012 season she was the Gopher's top-scoring freshman, the top-scoring rookie defenseman in the WCHA, was named to the WCHA All-Rookie team, and helped lead the team to back to back national championships in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. Jack, who was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, played his sophomore and junior hockey seasons at Minnetonka High School before forgoing his senior to play with the Penticton Vees of the BCHL.

Another son, Garrett, played for the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point in the Northern Collegiate Hockey Association. His nephew Jeremy Dehner is a defenseman with most of his career spent in European professional leagues.\n\nBorn in Madison, Wisconsin, Suter attended Madison East High School. He played college hockey at University of Wisconsin–Madison and was a member of the 1977 NCAA hockey champion Wisconsin Badgers. He was mostly noted for his rough play, setting several Badger records for penalty minutes before leaving in 1979. He initially joined the Tulsa Oilers under a tryout contract for a few games in late 1979, but soon joined the 1980 US Olympic hockey team on a full-time basis, where he won the gold medal.\n\nSuter was selected with the 120th pick in the 1977 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL and also 58th overall in the 1977 World Hockey Association draft by the Birmingham Bulls. He rejected Los Angeles' contract offer following the 1980 Olympics, and instead sat out 1980–81 season to become an unrestricted free agent. He came out of retirement in the spring of 1981 to play for the United States team at the 1981 Ice Hockey World Championship tournament in Stockholm. Suter signed with the Minnesota North Stars as unrestricted free agent in 1981, but spent the entire 1981–82 season in the Central Hockey League with the Nashville South Stars farm team. He retired in 1982 without playing a single game in the NHL.\n\nSuter returned to Madison after his retirement and opened a sporting goods store called Gold Medal Sports. He also coached youth hockey in Madison after his retirement and became a part-owner and director of Capitol Ice Arena in Middleton, Wisconsin. Ten months after Suter's death the Capitol Ice Arena was renamed in his honor and is now known as \"Bob Suter's Capitol Ice Arena.\" \n\nSuter died on September 9, 2014, of a heart attack suffered at Capitol Ice Arena. He is the first player from the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team to die.\n\nSuter was not featured in a 1981 TV movie about the 1980 U.S. hockey team called \"Miracle on Ice\", except in archival footage of the gold medal ceremony.\n\nIn the 2004 Disney film \"Miracle\", he is portrayed by Pete Duffy.\n\n\n"}

It is the best known of the auxins, and has been the subject of extensive studies by plant physiologists. IAA is a derivative of indole, containing a carboxymethyl substituent. It is a colorless solid that is soluble in polar organic solvents.\n\nIAA is predominantly produced in cells of the apex (bud) and very young leaves of a plant. Plants can synthesize IAA by several independent biosynthetic pathways. Four of them start from tryptophan, but there is also a biosynthetic pathway independent of tryptophan. Plants mainly produce IAA from tryptophan through indole-3-pyruvic acid. IAA is also produced from tryptophan through indole-3-acetaldoxime in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\".\n\nIn rats, IAA is a product of both endogenous and colonic microbial metabolism from dietary tryptophan along with tryptophol. This was first observed in rats infected by \"Trypanosoma brucei gambiense\". and correlation with protein intake has been confirmed in 2015. Humans did not excrete IAA.\n\nAs all auxins, IAA has many different effects, such as inducing cell elongation and cell division with all subsequent results for plant growth and development. On a larger scale, IAA serves as signaling molecule necessary for development of plant organs and coordination of growth.\n\nIAA enters the plant cell nucleus and binds to a protein complex composed of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3), resulting in ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins with increased speed. Aux/IAA proteins bind to auxin response factor (ARF) proteins, forming a heterodimer, suppressing ARF activity. In 1997 it was described how ARFs bind to auxin-response gene elements in promoters of auxin regulated genes, generally activating transcription of that gene when an Aux/IAA protein is not bound.\n\nIAA inhibits the photorespiratory-dependent cell death in photorespiratory catalase mutants. This suggests a role for auxin signalling in stress tolerance.\n\nIAA production is widespread among environmental bacteria that inhabit soils, waters, but also plant and animal hosts. Distribution and substrate specificity of the involved enzymes suggests these pathways play a role beyond plant-microbe interactions. Enterobacter cloacae can produce IAA, from aromatic and branched-chain amino acids.\n\nFungi can form a fungal mantle around roots of perennial plants called ectomycorrhiza. A fungus specific to spruce called Tricholoma vaccinum was shown to produce IAA from tryptophan and excrete it from its hyphae. This induced branching in cultures, and enhanced Hartig net formation. The fungus uses a multidrug and toxic extrusion (MATE) transporter Mte1. Research into IAA-producing fungi to promote plant growth and protection in sustainable agriculture is underway.\n\nSkatole, the odorant in feces, is produced from tryptophan via indoleacetic acid. Decarboxylation gives the methylindole.\n\nChemically, it can be synthesized by the reaction of indole with glycolic acid in the presence of base at 250 °C:\n\nAlternatively the compound has been synthesized by Fischer indole synthesis using glutamic acid and phenylhydrazine. Glutamic acid was converted to the necessary aldehyde via Strecker degradation.\n\nMany methods for its synthesis have been developed since its original synthesis from indole-3-acetonitrile.\n\nWilliam Gladstone Tempelman studied substances for growth promotion at Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. After 7 years of research he changed the direction of his study to try the same substances at high concentrations in order to stop plant growth. In 1940 he published his finding that IAA killed broadleaf plants within a cereal field.\n\nThe search for an acid with a longer half life, i.e. a metabolically and environmentally more stable compound led to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), both phenoxy herbicides and analogs of IAA. Robert Pokorny an industrial chemist for the C.B. Dolge Company in Westport, Connecticut published their synthesis in 1941.\n\nOther less expensive synthetic auxin analogs on the market for use in horticulture are indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA).\nWhen sprayed on broad-leaf dicot plants, they induce rapid, uncontrolled growth, eventually killing them. First introduced in 1946, these herbicides were in widespread use in agriculture by the middle of the 1950s.\n\nLittle research has been conducted on the effects of IAA on humans and toxicity data are limited. No data on human carcinogenic, teratogenic, or developmental effects have been created.\n\nIAA is listed in its MSDS as mutagenic to mammalian somatic cells, and possibly carcinogenic based on animal data. It may cause adverse reproductive effects (fetotoxicity) and birth defects based on animal data. No human data as of 2008. It is listed as a potential skin, eye, and respiratory irritant, and users are warned not to ingest it. Protocols for ingestion, inhalation, and skin/eye exposure are standard for moderately poisonous compounds and include thorough rinsing in the case of skin and eyes, fresh air in the case of inhalation, and immediately contacting a physician in all cases to determine the best course of action and not to induce vomiting when of ingested. The NFPA 704 health hazard rating for IAA is 2, which denotes a risk of temporary incapacitation with intense or prolonged, but not chronic exposure, and a possibility of residual injury.\n\nIAA produces microcephaly in rats during the early stage of cerebral cortex development. IAA decreased the locomotor activities of rat embryos/fetuses; treatment with IAA and analog 1(methyl)-IAA resulted in apoptosis of neuroepithelial cell and significantly decreased brain sizes relative to body weight in embryonic rats.\n\nIAA is an apoptosis-inducing ligand in mammals. As of 2010, the signal transduction pathways are as follows: IAA/HRP activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. It induces caspase-8 and caspase-9, which results in caspase-3 activation and poly(adp-ribose) polymerases cleavage. \nIn 2002 it had been hypothesized that IAA coupled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) could be used in targeted cancer therapy. Radical-IAA molecules would attach to cells marked by HRP and HRP reactive cells would be selectively killed. In 2010 in vitro experiments proved this concept of IAA as an immunotoxin when used in preclinical studies of targeted cancer therapy, as it induced apoptosis in bladder and in hematological malignancies.\n"}

In vacations he had driven a truck as a labourer. He worked for a bank which soon failed in the Great Depression. He flew briefly with the Curtis Flying service as a commercial pilot. He first came to the screen in 1926 before signing a standard acting contract with Paramount Pictures, in 1929. He appeared in the Marx Brothers movie \"Animal Crackers\" and several other small parts. Then, he signed with Columbia Pictures in 1935. He also later contracted with 20th Century Fox. \n\nAllen's first notable role was the male lead in \"Love Me Forever\" (1935), for which he won a \"Box Office Award\".\n\nAfter the departure of cowboy star Ken Maynard, Allen was plugged into producer Larry Darmour's formulaic \"Ranger\" pictures. Along with sidekick Wally Wales (played by Hal Taliaferro), he redefined the role, starring in six films for director Spencer Gordon Bennet in that year alone. The star was billed as Bob Allen. However, the great success of Wild Bill Elliott in Columbia's 1938 serial \"The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok\" prompted Columbia to drop Bob Allen and replace him with Elliott.\n\nAllen continued to work in pictures, as Robert Allen or Robert \"Tex\" Allen. He had acted on Broadway in the original productions of \"Show Boat\" and \"Kiss Them for Me\". In 1956 he appeared in the original production of \"Auntie Mame\", opposite Rosalind Russell, and later Greer Garson. He appeared in other Broadway plays, in touring productions, in soap operas, documentaries and commercials.

With Sertich's backing, Harrington won a walk-on spot on UMD's roster. He lettered for four seasons at UMD from 1975 to 1979.\n\nFollowing his collegiate playing career, Harrington was invited to try out for the 1979–80 US National team coached by the Minnesota Golden Gophers' Herb Brooks. Harrington made every cut and was placed on the Olympic roster for the 1980 Lake Placid games. The team went on to defeat the highly favored Soviet Union 4–3 in the first game of the Medal Round in an event named the \"Miracle on Ice\". The team defeated Finland 4–2 two days later to capture the Gold Medal for the US. Harrington is credited with an assist on Mike Eruzione's go-ahead game-winning goal against the USSR.\n\nUndrafted by the NHL, Harrington had a try-out with the Buffalo Sabres following the Olympics. The Sabres immediately assigned him to the Rochester Americans of the AHL, where he scored seven points in twelve games despite being a marked man. \"Some Canadian-born kids resent the fact that the Americans did so well in the Olympics and they're a bit jealous of them,\" claimed Buffalo defenseman Larry Playfair. In one game Harrington was struck in the face and needed six stitches to close a bloody gash on his chin. In another game against the Hershey Bears Harrington was attacked from behind by Lou Franceschetti and knocked unconscious for five minutes, lying in a pool of blood on the ice. He had to spend the night in a hospital with a concussion, fractured jaw, broken nose and four loosened teeth. Franceshetti was not penalized, insisting it was a \"clean\" check. \"My shoulder just connected with the back of his neck.\" \"If it was a clean check, how did I get it in the back of my head?\" asked Harrington. \"Lying in my hospital bed, I had all sorts of mixed emotions, especially when my teeth ached and my heart throbbed. I kept thinking of the cleaner game in Europe, that I could have gone to Switzerland to play hockey. Something like this can't help but discourage you. But this is the way it is in the pros and I'll make it one way or the other ... even if I have to face a few goofballs.\" \n\nHarrington played the 1980–81 season for Lugano in the Swiss league before returning to the US to play with the US National team from 1981–83 on a full-time basis. He was a member of the United States team at the 1981, 1982 and 1983 Ice Hockey World Championship tournaments. Between brief stints in the Central Hockey League, Harrington rejoined the national hockey team for the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\nFollowing 1984, Harrington retired from playing and rejoined his college roots as an assistant coach under former Montreal Canadiens star Ralph Backstrom at the University of Denver. The highlight of Harrington's time at Denver was 1985-86 when Denver won a school record 34 games and advanced to the NCAA Frozen Four. In 1990 Harrington returned to Minnesota as an assistant coach for St. Cloud State University.\n\nFrom 1993-2008, Harrington was the head hockey coach at Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota. Harrington turned around a listless program at Saint John's. By his fourth season he had guided SJU to a school-record 26-6-1 mark, the school's first conference championship since 1950, the school's first conference playoff championship, the school's first NCAA tournament berth and an NCAA third-place victory. In 15 seasons at Saint John's he has a career record of 241-142-31 (.620). He has won five MIAC titles, four MIAC playoff championships and has advanced to the NCAA tournament five times. Harrington is the school leader in career wins. In addition to his coaching duties, Harrington was the assistant athletic director at Saint John's.\n\nIt was announced on March 31, 2008 that Harrington would step down as head coach at Saint John's to become head coach for HC Ambri-Piotta of the Swiss National League. On December 16, 2008 he was fired. On January 19, 2009 Harrington signed a contract as head coach for Slovenia men's national ice hockey team, then on May 11, 2009, Harrington signed a contract with HC Asiago. He was a head coach for the Slovenia men's national ice hockey team until December 12, 2010, when he was fired. Matjaž Kopitar succeeded him in this post.\n\nAs part of the 1980 Olympic team, Harrington has been portrayed in movies twice with the most recent being Disney's 2004 release \"Miracle\". Harrington is portrayed by Nate Miller, who played hockey at the University of Minnesota from 1997-2000.\n\nPrior to \"Miracle\", Harrington was portrayed by Bill Schreiner in the 1981 made-for-TV movie \"Miracle on Ice\".\n\nJohn is married and has three children. He is the father of Chris Harrington, team captain and four-year letter winner on the Minnesota Golden Gopher hockey team from 2002–06 and currently a DEG Metro Stars defenseman.\n\nAmong family, friends and those who knew him in his high school and college playing days, John is known almost exclusively as \"Bah\" Harrington. He earned the nickname from his older brother who was barely a year old when John was born. The brother couldn't phonate the word baby and instead referred to his new sibling as \"bah.\" The name stuck. The rest of his siblings have nicknames too, including \"TP\", \"Tootie\", and the lovely \"Muggs.\"\n\n"}

Pavelich was a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team that won the gold medal in what has been called the \"Miracle on Ice\".\n\nThe son of Croatian immigrants, Pavelich grew up in rural Eveleth, Minnesota. A star performer on his high school hockey team, Eveleth High School. He attended the University of Minnesota Duluth as an amateur player for three seasons in 1977–79. Pavelich is best known for being a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, that won the gold medal in Lake Placid. In the game against the Soviet Union, Pavelich was credited with two assists, including one on Mike Eruzione's game-winning goal.\n\nAfter the Olympics, Pavelich, who was not drafted by an NHL team, played one season for HC Lugano in Switzerland where he registered 73 points. He returned to the US national team for the 1981 Ice Hockey World Championship tournament. He was brought back to the United States the following year by his former US Olympic coaches Herb Brooks and Craig Patrick, who managed of the New York Rangers. Despite his size, Pavelich thrived in his role as a center for the Rangers, and holds the Rangers record for most points as a rookie (76). However, his career in New York was ended by a feud with Brooks' successor Ted Sator, who introduced a traditional North American dump-and-chase style of play.\n\nPavelich briefly played for Brooks with the Minnesota North Stars in 1987 before returning to Europe. He had a stint in Britain for the Dundee Rockets and played two seasons in Italy for HC Bolzano. The expansion San Jose Sharks brought him out of retirement for the 1991–92 NHL season, but he would play only two games for the Sharks before retiring. However, he did record an assist on the Sharks' first-ever goal, scored by Craig Coxe in the third period of a 4-3 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on October 4, 1991.\n\nOn February 23, 1983, Pavelich became the first American ever to score five goals in a single game, against the Hartford Whalers at Madison Square Garden; he remains the only American to do so.\n\nIn the 2009 book \"100 Ranger Greats\", the authors ranked Pavelich at No. 83 all-time of the 901 New York Rangers who had played during the team's first 82 seasons.\n\nPavelich married Kara Burmachuk in 1994; they had no children.

Pavelich is the second player from the 1980 team to put a medal up for sale, with teammate Mark Wells having sold his in late 2010.\n\nPavelich's brother-in-law was also a hockey player and now coaches for the Hibbing Bluejackets, in Hibbing, Minnesota.\n\nPavelich was arrested on Aug. 15, 2019, after allegedly assaulting and seriously injuring a neighbor with whom he'd earlier been fishing. He was charged with four felony counts: second- and third-degree assault, possession of a short-barreled shotgun and possession of a firearm with a missing or altered serial number. On Oct. 28, Pavelich's upcoming trial was suspended and he was found incompetent to stand trial by Cook County District Judge Michael Cuzzo, who said Pavelich \"lacks the ability to rationally consult with counsel, is incapable of understanding the proceedings, and is incapable of participating in the defense due to mental illness or deficiency.\" Cuzzo initiated civil commitment proceedings. On Dec. 4, Cuzzo ruled that Pavelich is mentally ill and dangerous and ordered him committed to a secure treatment facility.\n\nPavelich's sister, Jean Gevik, has said that she believes he is suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and had noticed behavioral changes in the years leading up to the incident which led to his arrest.\n\nIn \"Miracle on Ice\", a 1981 TV movie about the 1980 U.S. hockey team, Pavelich is portrayed by Jack Blessing.\n\nIn the 2004 Disney film \"Miracle\", he is portrayed by Chris Koch.

He won the NCAA Championship in 1978 with Boston University, and was awarded New England Rookie of the Year 1976–1977.\n\nDrafted 59th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1978 NHL Entry Draft, Silk signed a contract with the Rangers on March 3, 1980, days after the Olympic gold medal game. He spent the next three seasons as a Ranger, playing mostly at right wing and center. Silk realized a childhood dream when he was traded to the Boston Bruins in 1983. He was claimed off waivers by the Detroit Red Wings the following season. After becoming a free agent in 1985, Silk signed with the Winnipeg Jets, finished his NHL career, and moved on to Germany for the 1986–87 season.\n\nSilk retired from hockey in 1991, returning to his alma mater Boston University where he served as the assistant men's hockey coach while attending BU's graduate school of management.\nSilk has been inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, United States Olympic Hall of Fame, Boston University Hall of Fame, Sports Illustrated, Sportsman of the Year, and also inducted into the Massachusetts Hockey Hall of Fame (NHL + Amateur).\n\nWhile attending Boston University, Silk earned both an undergraduate degree and a Masters of Business Administration degree and is a Director of Institutional Sales in Boston. When asked if Silk still ties up the skates he said \"I skate maybe once or twice a year for a charity event. I can’t say I miss it. I’m content. I’m good friends with former teammates Jack O’Callahan and also with Jack Hughes and Ralph Cox, who were the last two cuts from the team that year. The friendships, like I said, are the most important things for me to ever come out of my time in hockey\" (Carroll).\n\nRick Dano played Silk in the 1981 TV movie \"Miracle on Ice\".\n\nBobby Hanson played him in the 2004 Disney film \"Miracle\". Hanson played his college hockey at Boston University, where Silk, Jack O'Callahan, and Mike Eruzione had played. After college, Hanson played professional hockey in Europe, before a knee injury ended his career.\n\n"}

The building was designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, and consists of a mostly smooth black facade on a trapezoidal plot. It is approximately tall, with approximately . It is known for the distinctive sculpture at its entrance, Isamu Noguchi's \"Cube\".\n\nThe developer Erwin S. Wolfson acquired the site in several stages between 1952 and 1961. Initial plans called for a 36-story monolith, but when Wolfson died, the architects modified their plans to a 51-story tower, which occupied only two-fifths of the block and conformed to the 1961 Zoning Resolution. The building was erected between late 1964 and 1967 and was originally known for its main tenant, the Marine Midland Corporation (later part of HSBC). Several early tenants were affiliated with the financial industry, including banking and accounting firms. In 1998, the building was sold to Silverstein Properties, which undertook a major renovation.\n\nThe primary tenant of the building since 2002 is Brown Brothers Harriman, filling a vacancy left after HSBC relocated in 2001. The building has been owned by Union Investment since 2004, and was made a New York City designated landmark in 2013. Reviews of the building among architecture critics have been largely positive, with several praising the structure's smooth black facade.\n\n140 Broadway is located on an entire city block bounded to the west by Broadway, to the north by Liberty Street, to the east by Nassau Street, and to the south by Cedar Street. The block is an irregular trapezoid, with all of its frontages being of different lengths. The block measures along Broadway, along Liberty Street, along Nassau Street, and along Cedar Street. The building occupies two-fifth of the block, and its footprint is rhomboid, matching the shape of the block with dimensions of between . Roger N. Radford, the leader of the team that designed 140 Broadway, stated that many of the tenants he knew were unaware of the building's \"funny shape\".\n\nWithin 140 Broadway's immediate surroundings are One Liberty Plaza to the northwest; the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York and the Liberty Tower to the north; the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building to the northeast; 28 Liberty Street to the east; the Equitable Building to the south; the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings to the southwest; and Zuccotti Park to the west. Trinity Church and Wall Street are located two blocks south.\n\n140 Broadway was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) in the International Style, with Gordon Bunshaft as the lead on the project. It was erected by the Diesel Construction Company, co-founded by prolific real-estate developer Erwin S. Wolfson, and led by Carl Morse at the time of the building's construction. Roger N. Radford was the design team's leader; Allan Labie was the project manager; Bradley B. Sullivan was the job captain; and James Ruderman was the structural engineer. Thomas Crimmins Construction Company were hired to excavate the site, and U.S. Steel provided the steel.\n\n140 Broadway is 51 stories tall and measures tall. It has about on each floor, or total. The structure utilizes a frame weighing . Because of 140 Broadway's energy efficiency, the U.S. Green Building Council has certified 140 Broadway as a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold structure.\n\nThe New York City Department of City Planning passed the 1961 Zoning Resolution in October 1960, and the new zoning rules became effective in December 1961, superseding the 1916 Zoning Resolution. Rather than the inclusion of setbacks that the old zoning laws had encouraged, the new zoning laws allowed skyscrapers to have a bulky massing with additional floor area, in exchange for the inclusion of ground-level open spaces. 140 Broadway's design strictly adhered to the 1961 law; according to Radford, the law \"force[d] the mass of the building toward the center of the site\".\n\nHarry Helmsley, who took over the building's development after Wolfson's death, sought to emphasize the building's vertical axis. As a result, Radford decided to emphasize the vertical window-washing tracks along the black-aluminum facade. The facade is otherwise smooth, with glass panels as well as slightly-textured aluminum window trim. The western facade has three vertical bays of six windows each, while the eastern facade has four bays of six windows. The northern and southern facades each have seven bays of six windows. Little else was attached to the facade, except for signs with the number 140 on both faces of either southern corner, as well as the name of the Marine Midland Bank on the Broadway and Cedar Street sides. There are numerous revolving doors on all four sides that provide access to the building.\n\nInitial plans called for a rectangular building with a light-gray, grid-like facade made of concrete or aluminum. The building had been redesigned by 1965 to have a smooth facade that harmonized with the surrounding masonry buildings while standing out from its surroundings. One critic wrote that the previous design had 140 Broadway as \"a little brother to [28 Liberty Street] in the same shiny finish\", which he said \"would have looked like a poor relation.\" Another compared the new plan to contemporary graphic design and Ad Reinhardt's \"black\" paintings.\n\n140 Broadway is set back from the curb on Broadway, from Cedar Street's curb, and from Liberty Street's curb. A public plaza is located in this intermediate space and is made of tiled white travertine. An entrance to the New York City Subway's Broad Street station existed on the plaza's southeast corner but was removed by 1999. A granite monument to Harry Helmsley is located at the plaza's southwest corner. The sidewalks on all sides of 140 Broadway are wide and are maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation rather than the building's owners, but are sometimes considered part of the plaza.\n\nAccording to Radford, Bunshaft suggested that Isamu Noguchi be involved with the project. During the building's construction, Noguchi was commissioned to create a sculpture for the portion of the plaza facing Broadway. He had originally proposed a \"megalith\" or a \"cluster of primitivisitic monoliths\", but Bunshaft had suggested combining Noguchi's \"series of rocks\" into a single block.\n\nNoguchi's final sculpture\",\" titled \"The Cube\", was installed in 1968. It is a vermilion-hued rhombohedron with a cylindrical hole through its center, standing upon one corner and measuring tall. \"The Cube\" is located off-center, on the north side of the plaza, contrasting with 140 Broadway's dark facade while turning viewers' attention toward the surrounding plaza. Like 140 Broadway, it was detailed by SOM, and has an aluminum frame. Bunshaft praised \"The Cube\" as \"work[ing] beautifully with the building [in] every way\", while Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving said that the cube was a sign of \"change in public taste\".\n\nIn 1952, Wolfson began purchasing land on the city block bounded by Cedar, Liberty, and Nassau streets, and Broadway. The six plots on the block had been owned by different entities immediately prior to Wolfson's purchase, including The Clearing House, the National Bank of Commerce, and the Guaranty Trust Company (later part of J.P. Morgan & Co.), and had five buildings between nine and nineteen stories tall. These entities eventually sold all of their properties to J.P. Morgan, and in August 1961, Wolfson bought all six plots from J.P. Morgan. At the time, Wolfson was planning a 32-story building on the site, a bulky mass that would conform with the 1961 Zoning Resolution, as well as allow for the widening of Liberty Street in conjunction with 28 Liberty Street's construction. Simultaneously, SOM was hired as the architect.\n\nWolfson died suddenly in June 1962. The Diesel Construction Company asked developer Harry Helmsley to collaborate on the project when Wolfson died, and Helmsley created the 140 Broadway Corporation. Lawrence A. Wien also became a sponsor of the project. The plans were modified in May 1963 to provide for a 40-story skyscraper occupying two-fifths of the block. The modified plans also provided for closing Cedar Street, thereby forming a pedestrian plaza extending to 28 Liberty Street, as well as adding subway entrances. By June 1964, Wolfson's estate and Helmsley were about to submit plans for the building. Two months later, Wien withdrew from the project and Helmsley modified the building to have 49 floors, still occupying two-fifths of the block. The architects submitted a new-building application to the New York City Department of Buildings in early 1964, though minor changes to the plans were made in subsequent months.\n\nDemolition of existing buildings on the site started in June 1964. The builders endeavored to reduce noise as much as possible: demolition took place only during off-peak hours, and heavy blankets were used to muffle the sound of blasting as well as contain the debris. Site excavation was completed in the middle of the following year, and construction of the building frame commenced, with 600 workers being employed. Keeping with the noise-reduction policy of the foundation's excavation, the building utilized a \"butt-welded structural frame\", which necessitated less time on the noisy processes of bolting and riveting. One floor was built every two days, and 140 Broadway topped out during June 1966. One person working nearby stated that his lawnmower made more noise than the building's construction.\n\nIn October 1965, Marine Midland Bank leased the two basements and the first 20 floors. Because the bank was the largest tenant at 140 Broadway, Helmsley's corporation gave the bank naming rights to the building. According to the bank's annual report for that year, 140 Broadway was to be the new headquarters of the bank. The second floor contained the main banking hall. By March 1967, the building was 90% rented. The Department of Buildings gave a temporary occupancy certificate that April, and certified the building as complete in October 1967. Other original tenants at the building included Clarke, Dodge Company; Delafield Delafield; Laird Company Corporation; and Control Data Corporation. Later tenants included Morgan Stanley, Paine Webber, Ernest & Ernest, the City Midday Club, Puerto Rico's government, and Helmsley's company Helmsley-Spear. In 1980, HSBC acquired a 51% controlling interest in the Marine Midland Corporation.\n\nAfter Helmsley died in January 1997, his widow Leona Helmsley sold off over a dozen of his properties. \"The New York Times\" wrote that 140 Broadway had \"attracted the most attention from prospective buyers\": although the building was only 59% occupied and required renovations, real estate in the Financial District was highly sought. After several bids were received from six \"serious finalists\", the building was sold to Larry Silverstein's company Silverstein Properties for $190 million in January 1998. Subsequently, Silverstein undertook a $60 million renovation and leased out much of the remaining space. At the time, Silverstein harbored concerns that HSBC, which occupied 40% of the space, would move out once its lease expired in 2002. HSBC subsequently moved its primary headquarters to the HSBC Tower in Midtown Manhattan in 2001. Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. was then signed as 140 Broadway's major tenant, moving to 20 floors.\n\nThe building was purchased in 2004 by German firm Union Investment. On June 25, 2013, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Marine Midland Building as a New York City Landmark. In January 2018, the building's owners proposed adding circular planters to the plaza, as well as adding \"street furniture\" on the sidewalk, which would potentially displace street vendors. Despite controversy over the plans, the Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the changes in March 2018. The designs for the renovated plaza call for planters to be installed on the section of the plaza on Liberty Street.\n\nA bombing occurred on 140 Broadway's eighth floor on August 20, 1969, injuring 20 people. Police estimated the bomb to be the equivalent of 25 sticks of dynamite, making it among the city's strongest bomb blasts to date. The explosive was placed in a hallway just off the elevators some time during the evening and it exploded at around 10:30 pm. The injured were working on the night shift in the bank's stock bookkeeping department and were working on the other side of the corridor wall. The inside of this wall was lined with floor-to-ceiling automated file units that weighed 3 tons each and which absorbed most of the blast. Still, the blast moved the file units about a foot, blew out all the windows on that side of the building, and opened a hole in the reinforced concrete floor. The bomber, Sam Melville, was convicted of this and seven other 1969 Manhattan bombings and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was killed by a state sharpshooter during the Attica Prison riot in September 1971. As a result of the bombing, the Marine Midland Company increased security.\n\nIn 1972, Ronald Kaufman made an unsuccessful attempt to bomb the building by hiding an explosive in a bank vault. The building was again damaged in 1974, when Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña detonated a car bomb on the adjacent street. The bomb's force was equivalent to 40 sticks of dynamite and scattered debris for one and a half blocks.\n\nOn October 20, 1981, a fire occurred at 140 Broadway's 47th floor. When an elevator with five workers inside opened its doors on the 47th floor, the occupants were injured and had to manually seal the door. This prompted an investigation, which found that hundreds of New York City buildings' elevators did not have keys that enabled firefighters to navigate to specific floors. The elevators were supposed to have been upgraded as part of a 1973 law that mandated compliance with a new fire code, including upgrades to elevators that were activated by heat rather than automatically. The law had a deadline of September 1981, and after the fire at 140 Broadway, numerous landlords were given summonses for not complying with the new fire code.\n\nIn 1984, a disgruntled maintenance worker removed parts of 140 Broadway's air-conditioning system and stored these components elsewhere. After the air-conditioning system had been taken apart for the winter, the worker, Robert Rodriguez, dumped some crucial components of the air-conditioning system into a tank on the 37th floor, which served the building's sprinkler system. Some 10,000 workers lost air-conditioning for several weeks, being \"uncomfortably warm\" until June 1984, when Rodriguez was arrested and the parts of the air-conditioning system were retrieved by scuba divers.\n\nReviews among architecture critics were largely positive. In 1968, Ada Louise Huxtable of \"The New York Times\" described 140 Broadway as \"one of the handsomest [skyscrapers] in the city\", enhanced by the inclusion of \"The Cube,\" and two years later, said that it was the \"epitome of nineteen sixties sophisticated architectural elegance\" contrasting with the Chamber of Commerce and One Liberty Plaza. Huxtable further stated in 1974 that 140 Broadway was \"not only one of [the] buildings I admire most in New York, but that I admire most anywhere\". Huxtable's successor at the \"Times\", Paul Goldberger, said \"the glass curtain wall is dark and refined, it is discreet\", and ranked it as SOM's \"best\" New York City building. Goldberger later said that 140 Broadway probably had the \"most beautiful glass 'skin' of any skyscraper in Manhattan\". John Tauranac wrote that 140 Broadway was \"Manhattan’s most elegant tower\", while John Morris Dixon, writing in \"Architectural Forum\", said that 140 Broadway was among \"the handsomest office buildings in the U.S.A.\"\n\nAs early as 1996, architect Robert A. M. Stern had suggested that 140 Broadway was a viable candidate for official landmark status. The 2010 version of the \"AIA Guide to New York City\" characterized 140 Broadway as \"a taut skin stretched over bare bones\".\n\n140 Broadway's design was widely imitated. In New York City, subsequent buildings that used a similar style included SOM's 9 East 57th Street and Emery Roth's 450 Park Avenue, as well as SOM's designs for 919 Third Avenue and 1166 Avenue of the Americas.\n\n\n\n"}

When the Trojans arrived in Italy, Latinus decided to give his daughter to Aeneas instead because of instructions he had received from the gods to marry his daughter to a foreigner. Turnus was outraged and led his people as well as several other Italian tribes against the Trojans in war. Virgil's text ends when Aeneas defeats Turnus in single combat and therefore confirms his right to marry Lavinia. In some other accounts of the story of Aeneas, he is later killed in a subsequent battle with the Rutuli.\n\nDuring the 6th century BC, in Rome's early semi-legendary history, Rome's seventh and final king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus went to war with the Rutuli.

Wells then attended Bowling Green State University from 1975 to 1979 where he was a star forward with the Falcons in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Despite his abilities as a player, Wells did not receive a scholarship offer to play hockey until after his first season with the team. Following the completion of his college career, Wells, along with Falcons teammate Ken Morrow, was selected to play on the 1980 U.S. Olympic Men's Ice Hockey team that went on to win the gold medal at Lake Placid.\n\nWells was selected 176th overall in the 1977 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens. He joined Montreal's top farm team the Nova Scotia Voyageurs after the Olympics but was unable to secure a spot on the Canadians roster. He was traded to the Detroit Red Wings after the 1980 season, however refused the assignment and was released from his contract. Wells then signed as a free agent with the New York Rangers but spent the next two seasons shifting around the minor leagues playing for the New Haven Nighthawks, Flint Generals, Fort Wayne Komets and Oklahoma City Stars. Wells finally retired in 1982 without playing a single game in the NHL.\n\nFollowing his retirement from hockey, Wells worked as a restaurant manager in Rochester Hills, Michigan, but sustained a fractured vertebra while unloading crates. Following eleven hours of surgery, Wells was informed by the doctor that he had a rare degenerative spinal disease. The illness, which affects the disks in the spinal column, forced Wells to retire from work and has required multiple surgeries, leaving him bed-ridden for extended periods and clinically depressed. Wells did, however, manage to suit up for the reunion game with his 'Miracle on Ice' teammates prior to the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City—against doctor's orders, playing in one shift and recording a shot on goal.\n\nIn 2010, financially struggling from medical bills and in need of finances for further surgery, Wells reluctantly sold his gold medal medallion to a private collector for $40,000. The medal was later auctioned off by the buyer for $310,700. Having kept the medal on his nightstand for over twenty years, Wells expressed in a 2010 \"Daily News\" article how difficult a decision it had been to sell the medal: \"It killed me to sell the medal. Killed me. But my life was crumbling. I was going to lose my home. I needed to sell it to have surgery and to live.

A control room will often be part of a larger command center.\n\nA control room's purpose is production control, and serves as a central space where a large physical facility or physically dispersed service can be monitored and controlled. Central control rooms came into general use in factories during the 1920s.\n\nControl rooms for vital facilities are typically tightly secured and inaccessible to the general public. Multiple electronic displays and control panels are usually present, and there may also be a large wall-sized display area visible from all locations within the space. Some control rooms are themselves under continuous video surveillance and recording, for security and personnel accountability purposes. Many control rooms are manned on a \"24/7/365\" basis, and may have multiple people on duty at all times (such as implementation of a \"two-man rule\"), to ensure continuous vigilance. \n\nOther special-purpose control room spaces may be temporarily set up for special projects (such as an oceanographic exploration mission), and closed or dismantled once the project is concluded.\n\nControl rooms are typically found in installations such as:\n\nControl rooms are usually equipped with elaborate fire suppression and security systems to safeguard their contents and occupants, and to ensure continued operation in emergencies. In hazardous environments, the control room may also serve as an area of refuge for personnel trapped onsite. The rooms are typically crammed with equipment, mounted in multi-function rack mount cabinets to allow updating. The dense concentration of equipment often requires special electrical uninterruptible power supply (UPS) feeds and air conditioning.\n\nSince the control equipment is intended to control other items in the surrounding facility, these (often fire-resistance rated) service rooms require many penetrations for cables. Due to routine equipment updates these penetrations are subject to frequent changes, so that a control room maintenance program must include vigilant firestop maintenance for code compliance.\n\nDue to the nature of the sensitive equipment inside control room cabinets, it is useful to ensure the use of \"T-rated\" firestops, that are massive and thick enough to resist heat transmission to the inside of the control room. It is also common to place control rooms under positive pressure ventilation to prevent smoke or toxic gases from entering. If used, gaseous fire suppressants must occupy the space that is to be protected for a minimum period of time to be sure a fire can be completely extinguished. Openings in such spaces must, therefore, be kept to a minimum to prevent the escape of the suppression gas.\n\nA mobile control room is designated as particularly in high risk facilities, such as a nuclear power station or a petrochemical facility. It can provided a guaranteed life support for the anticipated safety control.\n\nThe design of a control room incorporates ergonomic and aesthetic features including optimum traffic flow, acoustics, illumination, and health and safety of the workers. Ergonomic considerations determine the placement of humans and equipment to ensure that operators can easily move into, out of, and around the control room, and can interact with each other without any hindrances during emergency situations; and to keep noise and other distractions to a minimum.\n\nControl room scenes dealing with crisis situations appear frequently in thriller novels and action films. In addition, a few documentaries have been filmed with scenes in real-life control room settings.\n\n"}

{"id": "2027920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027920", "title": "Blow molding", "text": "Blow molding\n\nBlow molding moulding) is a specific manufacturing process by which hollow plastic parts are formed and can be joined together. It is also used for forming glass bottles or other hollow shapes.\n\nIn general, there are three main types of blow molding: extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, and injection stretch blow molding.\n\nThe blow molding process begins with melting down the plastic and forming it into a parison or, in the case of injection and injection stretch blow molding (ISB), a preform. The parison is a tube-like piece of plastic with a hole in one end through which compressed air can pass.\n\nThe parison is then clamped into a mold and air is blown into it. The air pressure then pushes the plastic out to match the mold. Once the plastic has cooled and hardened the mold opens up and the part is ejected. The cost of blow molded parts is higher than that of injection-molded parts but lower than rotational molded parts.\n\nThe process principle comes from the idea of glassblowing. Enoch Ferngren and William Kopitke produced a blow molding machine and sold it to Hartford Empire Company in 1938. This was the beginning of the commercial blow molding process. During the 1940s the variety and number of products was still very limited and therefore blow molding did not take off until later. Once the variety and production rates went up the number of products created soon followed.\n\nThe technical mechanisms needed to produce hollow bodied workpieces using the blowing technique were established very early on. Because glass is very breakable, after the introduction of plastic, plastic was being used to replace glass in some cases. The first mass production of plastic bottles was done in America in 1939. Germany started using this technology a little bit later, but is currently one of the leading manufacturers of blow molding machines.\n\nIn the United States soft drink industry, the number of plastic containers went from zero in 1977 to ten billion pieces in 1999. Today, an even greater number of products are blown and it is expected to keep increasing.\n\nFor amorphous metals, also known as bulk metallic glasses, blow molding has been recently demonstrated under pressures and temperatures comparable to plastic blow molding.\n\nIn extrusion blow molding (EBM), plastic is melted and extruded into a hollow tube (a parison). This parison is then captured by closing it into a cooled metal mold. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it into the shape of the hollow bottle, container, or part. After the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected.\n\nExamples parts made by the EBM process:\nmost polyethylene hollow products,\nmilk bottles,\nshampoo bottles,\nautomotive ducting,\nwatering cans, and\nhollow industrial parts such as drums.\n\n\n\nStraight EBM is a way of propelling material forward similar to injection molding whereby an Archimedean screw turns, then stops and pushes the melt out.\n\nWith the accumulator method, an accumulator gathers melted plastic and when the previous mold has cooled and enough plastic has accumulated, a rod pushes the melted plastic and forms the parison. In this case the screw may turn continuously or intermittently. With continuous extrusion the weight of the parison drags the parison and makes calibrating the wall thickness difficult. The accumulator head or reciprocating screw methods use hydraulic systems to push the parison out quickly reducing the effect of the weight and allowing precise control over the wall thickness by adjusting the die gap with a parison programming device.\n\nContinuous Extrusion Blow Molding is a variation of Extrusion Blow Molding. In continuous extrusion blow molding, the parison is extruded continuously and the individual parts are cut off by a suitable knife.\n\n\nIntermittent Extrusion Blow molding is a variation of Extrusion Blow Molding.\n\n\nContainers such as jars often have an excess of material due to the molding process. This is trimmed off by spinning a knife around the container which cuts the material away. This excess plastic is then recycled to create new moldings. Spin Trimmers are used on a number of materials, such as PVC, HDPE and PE+LDPE. Different types of the materials have their own physical characteristics affecting trimming. For example, moldings produced from amorphous materials are much more difficult to trim than crystalline materials. Titanium coated blades are often used rather than standard steel to increase life by a factor of 30 times.\n\nThe process of injection blow molding (IBM) is used for the production of hollow glass and plastic objects in large quantities. In the IBM process, the polymer is injection molded onto a core pin; then the core pin is rotated to a blow molding station to be inflated and cooled. This is the least-used of the three blow molding processes, and is typically used to make small medical and single serve bottles. The process is divided into three steps: injection, blowing and ejection.\n\nThe injection blow molding machine is based on an extruder barrel and screw assembly which melts the polymer. The molten polymer is fed into a hot runner manifold where it is injected through nozzles into a heated cavity and core pin. The cavity mold forms the external shape and is clamped around a core rod which forms the internal shape of the preform. The preform consists of a fully formed bottle/jar neck with a thick tube of polymer attached, which will form the body. similar in appearance to a test tube with a threaded neck.\n\nThe preform mold opens and the core rod is rotated and clamped into the hollow, chilled blow mold. The end of the core rod opens and allows compressed air into the preform, which inflates it to the finished article shape.\n\nAfter a cooling period the blow mold opens and the core rod is rotated to the ejection position. The finished article is stripped off the core rod and as an option can be leak-tested prior to packing. The preform and blow mold can have many cavities, typically three to sixteen depending on the article size and the required output. There are three sets of core rods, which allow concurrent preform injection, blow molding and ejection.\n\n\n\nInjection Stretch Blow Molding has two main different methods, namely Single-stage and Double-stage process. The Single-stage process is then again broken down into 3-station and 4-station machines.\n\nIn the single-stage process both preform manufacture and bottle blowing are performed in the same machine. The older 4-station method of injection, reheat, stretch blow and ejection is more costly than the 3-station machine which eliminates the reheat stage and uses latent heat in the preform, thus saving costs of energy to reheat and 25% reduction in tooling. The process explained: Imagine the molecules are small round balls, when together they have large air gaps and small surface contact, by first stretching the molecules vertically then blowing to stretch horizontally the biaxial stretching makes the molecules a cross shape. These \"crosses\" fit together leaving little space as more surface area is contacted thus making the material less porous and increasing barrier strength against permeation. This process also increases the strength to be ideal for filling with carbonated drinks.\n\nHighly suitable for low volumes and short runs. As the preform is not released during the entire process the preform wall thickness can be shaped to allow even wall thickness when blowing rectangular and non-round shapes.\n\nRestrictions on bottle design – only a champagne base can be made for carbonated bottles.\n\nIn the two-stage injection stretch blow molding process, the plastic is first molded into a \"preform\" using the injection molding process. These preforms are produced with the necks of the bottles, including threads (the \"finish\") on one end. These preforms are packaged, and fed later (after cooling) into a reheat stretch blow molding machine. In the ISBM process, the preforms are heated (typically using infrared heaters) above their glass transition temperature, then blown using high-pressure air into bottles using metal blow molds. The preform is always stretched with a core rod as part of the process.\n\nVery high volumes are produced. Little restriction on bottle design. Preforms can be sold as a completed item for a third party to blow. Is suitable for cylindrical, rectangular or oval bottles.\n\nHigh capital cost. Floor space required is high, although compact systems have become available.\n\n\n"}

Next year, Rollins at age 21, moved to Edmonton to play for the Edmonton Flyers. Rollins believed the Flyers were a team capable of capturing the Allan Cup and he also believed if he played well enough he might get signed into the NHL. Rollins' gamble paid off and the Edmonton Flyers won the Allan Cup in 1947-48. He played 24 games that season, winning 20 and posting a 1.93 GAA.\n\nRollins played in the minor leagues for a couple of years before he was signed by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1950-51. Rumors had it that he was there to simply put pressure on Turk Broda to lose weight. This wasn't exactly true as the Leafs also needed to shore up their rapidly thinning goaltender depth chart. That season the Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup.\n\nRollins could not convince the Leafs management that he could be their full-time goaltender. In 1951-52, he was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks for veteran Harry Lumley. For 5 years he played for the Black Hawks, a team that usually finished last in the NHL which majorly contributed to his 141-205-83 record. But despite that, hockey pundits saw Rollins as one of the league's best goaltenders and in 1953-54 he played in the NHL All-Star Game and was awarded the Hart Trophy, even though he only won 12 games and lost 47 that season.\n\nRollins is, as of 2015, one of two eligible players, along with Tommy Anderson, to win the Hart Memorial Trophy and not be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1957-58, the Chicago Black Hawks acquired great Glenn Hall from the Detroit Red Wings. He was sent to the minor leagues as the Black Hawks preferred Hall. He would stay in the minor leagues until 1959-60, when he was signed on by the New York Rangers. He played 10 games with the club before he was sent back to the minor leagues again. This would mark the end of his NHL career. In 1966, although he was 37 years old, Rollins helped the Drumheller Miners to an Allan Cup victory in 1965-66.\n\nAfter retiring, he opted to become a coach. Rollins coached the University of Calgary hockey team as well as clubs in Spokane, Salt Lake City, Houston, Tulsa and Phoenix. As a coach, he achieved a good measure of success, including an Allan Cup victory with the Spokane Jets in 1970. Rollins was named coach of the WHA Phoenix Roadrunners in 1976, replacing local favourite Sandy Hucul. Rollins was generally hated in Phoenix after his years as coach of the WHL rival Salt Lake Golden Eagles, and his tenure in Phoenix resulted in the demise of the Roadrunner franchise after only one season at the helm.\n\nHis son Jerry Rollins played in the now defunct WHA.\n\n"}

Within New York, its footprint stretches as far north as the Canada–US border, as far west as Oswego and as far south as Goshen at the northern fringe of the New York metropolitan area. Its Vermont outlets can be found in Rutland and Bennington counties.\n\nKnown for branded ice cream, potato chips, hard rolls, milk, coffee and other drinks, three-fourths of their stores also sell gasoline—either their own brand or in partnership with Sunoco. In addition, most also feature a small dining area. \n\nThere are now 337 shops in operation.\n\nStewart's traces its origins to Percy and Charles V. Dake taking over the family dairy farm in Middle Grove in 1917. They began making Dake's Delicious Ice Cream beginning in 1921.\n\nFourteen years later, the brothers started Saratoga Dairy in an old barn in Saratoga Springs. This move occurred in the same year that New York began requiring all milk to be pasteurized. Without this new local plant available, many local dairy farmers would have had to go out of business, and they were grateful vendors.\n\nIn 1938 they expanded into the city's old water works, and then went into making cheese, powdered whey and casein two years afterward, following another new property purchase, this time in Greenfield. That and the milk this plant produced were sold all over the Northeast, as far south as Maryland.\n\nAs the war ended in 1945, the brothers bought an ice cream production facility in Ballston Spa from Donald Stewart. Charles S. \"Charlie\" Dake, Charles V.'s son, newly discharged from the military and looking for something to do, decided to start selling Stewart's Ice Cream to the public fresh off the line in the factory store front. This is considered to be the first Stewart's Shop.\nTwo others quickly followed, in Saratoga Springs and South Glens Falls. They were popular since ice cream and other sweet foods had been tightly rationed during the war. In 1948 the company introduced the folding paper ice cream carton so customers could bring home fresh ice cream more cheaply. The more notable innovation of the year, however, came from Charlie Dake's wife Phyllis \"Philly\" Dake, who suggested allowing people to make their own sundaes from a choice of toppings, a practice which continues today and has been widely imitated. The company's Philly Vanilla ice cream was named in her honor.\n\nSaratoga Dairy and Stewart's Ice Cream were formally incorporated with the state in 1950, and ice cream production was moved back to the Greenfield facility, which could handle the increased demand. By 1955 there were over 50 Stewart's Shops.\n\n1957 saw a regulatory battle between the companies and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the right to sell the company's own milk in its own stores. It was resolved in Stewart's favor, and as a result of this vertical integration, retail milk prices in the stores dropped by 25%.\n\nThe younger Dake took over the company from his uncle in 1959 and the following year brought his brother, William \"Bill\" Dake in. The holder of a graduate degree in engineering from Cornell University, William was able to solve some production problems at the dairy, and as a result it began running at a profit. Over the course of the 1960s, the new Dake brothers turned the company into one of the East's largest private dairies.\n\nCharlie Dake died of cancer in 1978, leaving Bill to carry on the business. In 1984, Bill's son, Gary, joined the company, and Bill began grooming him to take over. A decade later, the company built a new dairy facility and bought the Bonfare chain, adding 40 stores at a single stroke. In the late 1990s, it began aggressively expanding out of its base in the Capital District, pushing south into the mid-Hudson Valley for the first time.\n\nIn 2003 Gary became president of the company, while his father became chairman. Gary is the third generation of Dakes to helm the company.\n\nThe company has long believed in employee ownership; nearly 40% of its stock is held by employees, through the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), known as \"Profit Sharing.\" Any employees who works more than 1,000 hours a year become eligible for this kind of stock. For 2017, the company is said to have contributed $11 million to it.\n\n"}

He was twice elected the twelfth Mayor of Washington D.C. During his lifetime he amassed an invaluable and vast collection of books, manuscripts, original maps and other archival material from statesmen, and American and British military officers of the American Revolution. Force's collection is considered to be among the most extensive. Force served in the Washington militia as a lieutenant during the War of 1812. Politically, he was a member of the Whig Party, and supporter of John Quincy Adams. He is mostly noted for editing and publishing a massive collection of historical documents, books and maps in several volumes involving the American colonies and the American Revolution which was ultimately purchased by the Library of Congress for a large sum. Force founded a political journal and other publications and was president of a premier national science society, and the Typographical Society which was largely charged with the task of communicating political affairs to the general public. Force served on the committee that approved the Geographical Department for the Library of Congress. During the international political unrest caused by the American Civil War, Force was sent to Europe by the Lincoln Administration to stabilize diplomatic relations with France and England.\n\nPeter Force was born near the Passaic Falls in New Jersey, the son of William Force and Sarah Ferguson. William was a soldier in the Revolutionary War and a descendant of French Huguenots who arrived on America's shores in the 17th century. His father's participation in the war largely inspired Peter's interest in history. Force grew up in New Paltz, Ulster County, New York, and afterward moved to New York City, where he was schooled in the printing trade. Force married Hannah Evans; together they had three sons, William Quereau Force (1820–1880), Charles Force (no DOB available) and Manning Force (1824–1899), who was a noted Major General from Ohio during the American Civil War. Force was not considered a jovial man, but rather quiet and reserved, yet had an amiable personality that attracted people to him.\n\nIn 1812 Force became a member of the New York Typographical Society, which was the city's printer trade union at the time. He was initiated at its general meeting on February 1, 1812. He was elected a director on December 5, 1812, and at age twenty-two was chosen president on July 3, 1813, with his re-election following in 1814 and 1815.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Force served in the New York State Militia and rose to the rank of Sergeant and then to Lieutenant. \n\nForce began his varied career as a journeyman printer working for William A. Davis in New York City, and performed so well he was soon made the director of the office at age sixteen. In 1815, Force's employer secured a contract for the printing of Congress, and moved to Washington, D.C., and Peter Force, at age twenty-five, followed and also became a resident and a printer in that city. Soon he formed a partnership with Davis working as the foreman and public printer in the congressional printing plant, which at the time was quite small, having only four single-pull, wooden hand presses, which were sufficient to do all the work of the Government in 1816. In that same year he joined the Columbia Typographical Society and in 1826 became its first \"free member\". When Davis withdrew from the partnership Force formed other partnerships, of which he was the master mind. \n\nEarly in his career in Washington Force attracted the attention of distinguished statesmen, and he was a leading character in the city throughout his life. Four years after arriving in Washington he founded and published an annual devoted to recording the facts of early American history, with its wide scope of official and statistical information. From 1820 to 1836, with a three-year interval involved in politics, he published the \"National Calendar\", which later became the \"National Calendar and Annals of the United States\". On November 7, 1836, the National Typographical Convention assembled in Washington, and appointed a committee of three \"to wait upon Mr. Force, Mayor of this city (a member of the Columbia Typographical Society), to tender to him the good wishes of the convention, and to invite him to honor it with his presence ...and welcomed in an ardent manner by an address from the president, and by congratulations of the members of the convention individually.\"\n\nDuring the 1820s, Force was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences and served as the president. In 1820 he began publishing the \"National Calendar\", a statistical annual, which lasted 16 years, ending in 1836. From November 12, 1823, to February 2, 1830, Force published the\" National Journal\", with moderate-conservative views about public concerns and issues, which became the official newspaper during the presidency of John Quincy Adams, and which also drew to its columns from some widely known contributors, including John Quincy Adams himself. At the same time the journal tried to remain neutral in politics. The journal became a daily newspaper in 1824 and continued in this capacity until 1831. In 1830, however, Force gave up his position as the newspaper's editor.\n\nFrom 1820 until 1828 Force compiled, printed and published the \"Biennial Register\", the official directory of the U.S. government. In 1827 Force was given the job of printing a 109-page supplement to the Catalogue of the Library of Congress at his printing shop in Washington on the corner of Eleventh Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. The supplement included an author index and titles contained in supplements of 1820 and 1825. \n\nDuring his lifetime he was also a member of the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Naval Observatory, and played a major role in organizing the American Historical Society, in Washington in 1836. On August 22, 1822, Force was granted US Patent 3573X for a method of color printing. He also founded, published, and wrote in the \"National Journal\" (1823–1830) and would later donate a stone to the Washington Monument. After vigorously supporting John Quincy Adams' election to the presidency in 1824, he served locally as councilman and alderman. During the seventh year of his residency in Washington he was elected to the City Council, then to the Board of Aldermen, and was chosen president by both bodies. He was elected mayor of Washington in 1836 and again 1838 without opposition, but when he ran again in 1848 he was defeated by a wide margin, all as a member of the Whig Party. Thereafter he became president of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science. Force was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1851.\n\nUp until the early 1850s, the Library of Congress lacked a geographical department and an adequate collection of maps for an institution of its size and station. Lieutenant Edward B. Hunt of the U.S. Army formulated a plan and proposed a resolution for such a department and appointed a committee to review the proposal. Force was on the committee that passed that resolution in 1856. The committee stated, \"There is not in the United States nor on this continent a single collection of geographical materials which is even tolerably complete.\" Many original and rare maps from the Force library were provided to this department. \n\nIn November 1861, Force was sent to Europe at the recommendation of influential friends in President Lincoln's administration in a diplomatic effort to appeal to the political circles in Paris and London concerning their precarious relations with the Union and the Confederacy. Force was accompanied by Archbishop Hughes and Bishop McIlvaine with the hopes of inducing the respective governments to refrain from giving aid to the Confederacy. Force established healthy permanent relations with the various British and French statesmen. Upon returning to America in early June 1862, he received from the Corporation of New York the honor of Freedom of the City. On June 9 of that year the Typographical Society expressed their gratitude for Force's safe arrival from a mission \"fraught with the safety, honor and welfare of our country,\" and invited him to visit its chambers so that his fellow-members could express their thanks and congratulations for his diplomatic efforts in convincing the governments and people of Europe of the Union Government's ability to defeat the Confederacy.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Peter's son, Manning Force rose through successive ranks to become a major-general in the Militia of the District of Columbia. He was present at the Battle of Vicksburg and served under William Tecumseh Sherman during Sherman's March to the Sea. During that war Peter and his son corresponded frequently.\nDuring the Northern Virginia campaign of 1862 General Robert E. Lee and his army were getting dangerously close to Washington D.C. Charles B. Norton, a Union colonel on the staff of General Fitz John Porter was, in civilian life, also an archivist and publisher, and offered to hide and store Force's large library of Americana over the concern of a possible Confederate attack on the capitol, but Force declined his offer.\n\nForce's methods as an archivist and publisher of source materials was different in various ways from that of some of his contemporaries like Jared Sparks. Unlike Sparks, Force rarely added editorial notes and was content to let the raw documents speak for themselves. Force methodologically followed his primary rule that no manuscript should be altered, which is what set him apart from some of the editors of his day. Nothing was to be added and nothing substituted. Conversely, when Sparks edited the Papers of George Washington, as an admirer of his hero, Sparks would often correct Washington's mistakes in grammar and would sometimes alter the meaning of a statement so as to make it conform to what he felt was in Washington's mind. This was a practice Force abhorred and would never tolerate.\n\nForce was the first historical scholar to discover that the so-called \"Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence of 1775\" was not what it was claimed to be. Subsequently he published the declaration of independence, or Notes on Lord Mahon's History of the American Declaration of Independence\".\n\nForce's greatest achievement came as a collector and editor of historical documents. He published \"Tracts and Other Papers, Relating Principally to the Origin, Settlement, and Progress of the Colonies in North America\" (4 vol Washington, 1836–1846), which comprised rare pamphlets. His nine volume \"American Archives\", published at intervals from 1837 to 1853, was a collection of the most important documents of the American Revolution, 1774–1776. \n\nIn 1833 he was awarded a contract with the Federal Government for the preparation, printing and publication of his massive compilation of archival material. It extended to nine volumes, which had been carefully arranged with great care and consummate skill, but after the delivery of the ninth volume the officials upon whom the law imposed the necessity of giving a viable review never managed to read the manuscripts, and the prospective publication of the work came to a standstill while Force was still eager to continue, and had many important documents and manuscripts yet to be printed. Futilely Force continued his efforts to prevail upon complacent and uninterested officers to reverse the action of their predecessors, and finally, and reluctantly, relinquished his cherished project, which he had earnestly pursued for more than 30 years.\n\nTwenty large folio volumes were planned but only the first 9 volumes were published between 1837 and 1853. Matthew St. Clair Clarke and Force were co-publishers of Force's \"American Archives\". Force's lifelong desire to contribute to the Library of Congress finally came to fruition in 1867 when through an act of Congress it purchased his collection of original documents for $100,000, augmenting the expansion of the Library of Congress conducted by its librarian Ainsworth Rand Spofford, who directed the Library from 1865 to 1897.\n\nDuring his years of pursuing and buying archival material Force carried off prizes at auctions which the other competitors were not knowledgeable of. Force traveled about the eastern seaboard of the United States \"ransacking\" the book-shops and attending book auctions from Boston to Charleston in his tireless search for rare volumes. On one such occasion he was a bidder against the Library of Congress for a sizable and valuable library of bound pamphlets, the property of an early collector, who had consigned them to an auction house in Philadelphia. On another occasion while in Boston Force acquired from an antiquarian bookseller the only collection of Boston Revolutionary newspapers which were offered for sale in the last twenty-five years. He was soon reproached by some visitors from New England and admonished for depriving New England of its archival treasure. He rebuffed them replying, \"Why didn't you buy them yourselves, then?\" Force was relentless in his efforts to acquire complete and unbroken collections of all the Washington newspapers he could lay his hands on. After some thirty years he had amassed a collection which nearly filled the basement in his home. Into his elder years Force often visited the War Department, approaching various Army officers he knew in his quest for archival material. His collection of the printed \"Army orders\" from the War Department was considered \"a miracle of completeness\". \nIn 1867 the Library of Congress and a joint Committee of Congress was formed for the purpose of examining the extensive assortment of archival material in the Peter Force library. Because of its enormous size, totaling approximately 150,000 items, it was necessary for the committee to enter closely into details, and to devote much time and assiduous effort to the task of assessing Force's library. The committee spent at least two to three hours per day, for a two month period, in the examination of every document, manuscript, book, map, etc, that passed through their hands. To help simplify matters the contents of the Force library were categorized into seven basic classes. The committee found Force's archival collection to be encompassing in many respects: \"The plan of this work embraced nothing less than a complete publication of all the more important original State papers, letters, narratives, and other documents relating to the settlement and history of the United States, from the discovery of America. His library embraces an immense collection of the early American voyages, in Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Dutch, and English, while in books and pamphlets relating to the politics and government of the American colonies, it stands unrivaled in this country.\"\n\nAmong the items in Force's collection, and considered the most valuable, are a series of original military maps and plans in manuscript, from the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. Claimed by some historians to be of exceeding interest, many of them are the actual work of officers in the American and British armies. The collection of some 300 hand-drawn maps covers the entire United States from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Among the manuscript items in Force's library are 48 folio volumes containing historical autographs of great rarity. In 1867 Ainsworth R. Spofford edited an eight-page report of the Committee's findings and assessments. In 1875, Peter Force's son, William Q. Force, donated various personal papers he had discovered to the Library of Congress. \n\nIt wasn't until the late twentieth century was the value of Force's collection of documents, manuscripts, books and other archival material finally recognized by much of the historical community. Force's vast collection of archives possessed the only surviving copies of many important documents of the colonial and revolutionary eras and proved to be a valuable scholarly resource. Many large research libraries in the United States and around the world hold Force's nine volume published works in their collections, however, it remains a relatively underused source of information. Scholars, historians, and students alike have found the massive work difficult to navigate using Force's complicated and varied index for the wide assortment of materials. In 2001 Northern Illinois University Libraries and Professor Allan Kulikoff from the University of Georgia received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to fund the digitization of Force's \"American Archives\" and their presentation in a free-use World Wide Web site.\n\nForce maintained his ardent pursuit of collecting books, newspapers, manuscripts and other documents up until the week before he died, on January 23, 1868 at the age of 77. He is buried alongside his wife in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington D.C. Force's grave marker was designed by German sculptor Jacques Jouvenal. It is a marble obelisk that stands 16 feet high and rests on top of a square base. A relief is carved into the obelisk of a bookshelf filled with books. The District opened the Peter Force School in 1879 on the south side of Massachusetts Avenue between 17th and 18th Streets. It was razed in 1962.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2027940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027940", "title": "The Dirty Pair", "text": "The Dirty Pair\n\nThe Dirty Pair is an original English-language manga written and illustrated by Adam Warren, based on the original \"Dirty Pair\" characters created by Haruka Takachiho.\n\nThe American comic company and manga translator Studio Proteus acquired rights to create comic versions of the Dirty Pair in 1988. The first three limited series, reprinted in the collected editions \"Biohazards\", \"Dangerous Acquaintances\", and \"Plague of Angels\", were published by the since-defunct Eclipse Comics. Later, the rights were transferred to Dark Horse Comics. The first three series were written by Toren Smith and Adam Warren and drawn by Warren—after that, Smith left the project and Warren took over writing completely. These stories have a much more cyberpunk style than the other versions; the later stories, starting with \"Fatal But Not Serious\", move into the transhuman and posthuman subgenres.\n\nKei and Yuri are two Trouble Consultants (Criminal Division, Class A) for the World Welfare Work Association (3WA), code-named \"Lovely Angels\", but known throughout the United Galactica (UG) as the \"Dirty Pair\", a nickname given to them by the press due to their bad luck with their missions, which always seem to end in complete disaster. But they are always cleared of any wrongdoing by the UG's Central Computer because the extreme damage is never actually their fault (though their mere presence has been known to make things worse).\n\nThey originally met at Meizuru university for Lucien genetic upgrades around A.D. 2134, although it is not necessarily canon, they were both misfits within their year, and so became friends. Around A.D. 2137, just before graduation from Meizuru university, they played a prank on their friends, convincing them that they were both psychic. Shortly afterwards, news reached the 3WA and they were scouted for recruitment and tested by a parapsychology institute. The pair cheated every which way possible (the really short skirts were Kei's idea), and they tested positive for clairvoyance; the 3WA considered this to be useful and hired them.\n\nAlthough outwardly they almost constantly fight and bicker with each other, they are both loyal best friends, always pairing up together to deck anyone that calls them by their \"Dirty Pair\" nickname.\n\nKei, 19, was born November 27, 2122. She is a Lucien-type genetic upgrade, has long red hair with large bangs, brown eyes (more often than not green), is 171 cm tall and weighs 59 kg. Kei shares the same Lucien genetic code somatotype as Yuri, meaning that their bodies are basically identical, including height. Kei is the tomboy of the pair, outgoing, loud, and boisterous. She has remarked that she is \"the exciting half of our team\" and that \"drinking or sex would be my responsibilities.\" Although she often fights and argues with Yuri, she has displayed a much softer side to her personality, revealing in the \"Sim Hell\" mini-series that her biggest fear is that of losing Yuri, and having very watery eyes over the death of the original Yuri during \"Fatal But Not Serious\". Kei has a passion for cheesecake, large firearms, and bleeding edge mecha and war-tech.\n\nThe original Yuri was born March 18, 2122; and the current clone on September 12, 2141. She is a Lucien-type genetic upgrade, has long black hair, blue eyes, is 171 cm tall and weighs 58 kg. Yuri shares the same Lucien genetic code somatotype as Kei, meaning that their bodies are basically identical, including height. Yuri is the more stereotypical retro-feminine of the two, being the more demure, modest, polite, and friendly of the two. This appears to stem from her traditional Japanese upbringing, and possibly from her fears of what other people think of her in regard to all the disasters they have been indirectly involved in. During the plot line of \"Fatal But Not Serious\", another version of her was cloned from her stolen personality construct and tissue samples kept on record at the 3WA. The cloned version of Yuri had a \"seratonin-based progressive imbalance\" set into her neurochemistry to make her psychotically suicidal, and was tasked with the mission of killing the original Kei and Yuri (which she believed to be a simulation). She was partially successful, terminating only the original Yuri. Shortly after, the cloned Yuri received medical attention, and is now identical to the original Yuri. Although she often fights with her partner Kei, she has a deep devotion to her best friend. In \"Sim Hell\", while dining with \"an old friend,\" Dan, she spoke of nothing but Kei, and when it was revealed Kei was in danger, ran immediately to her aid. In \"Fatal But Not Serious\", Yuri could not bring herself to kill Kei in cold blood, despite her neurochemistry imbalance. It is also revealed that Yuri has a deep admiration for Kei's rebel side, stealing her stuff in \"Fatal But Not Serious\" and acting the \"bad girl\", as well as attempting to act more like Kei after they engaged synchronous puppet mode, taking control of each other's bodies and trading perps in \"Run From the Future\".\n\n\"Biohazards\" is an original English-language manga written by Toren Smith and Adam Warren and illustrated by Warren, based on the \"Dirty Pair\" characters created by Haruka Takachiho. The series was originally published by Eclipse Comics between December 1988 and April 1989, and was first published in paperback and hardcover graphic novel format in 1990. With the transfer of the property rights to Dark Horse Comics, \"Biohazards\" was republished as a trade paperback entitled \"Dirty Pair: Biohazards - 10th Anniversary Special Edition\" in September 1998. This edition includes the 8-page short story \"I Honestly Hate You\" from the 1994 \"San Diego Comic Con Comics\" #3 as a bonus.\n\nThe Lovely Angels are assigned to Pacifica. Tissue samples and the single surviving brainchip of leading biotechnical engineer Kelvin A. O'Donnell have been stolen by agents of Abraham Streib, a rival industrialist maimed in an accident apparently staged by O'Donnell. Enter the Dirty Pair, who rescue O'Donnell's brainchip, implanted by Streib in a cuddly Pseudo-Fuzzy. Mission accomplished, but O'Donnell convinces the Angels of Streib's traffic in illegal bioweapons, and persuades them to help him retrieve his tissue samples so he can regain his humanity. His consciousness transferred to a synthetic warbeast, O'Donnell leads the Pair to Streib's lab, obliterating most of his cronies—and a sizable section of Pacifica's capital city. O'Donnell assures the destruction of Streib's operation, and of Streib himself, but, en route home, is arrested by Pacifica Security for unlawful bioweapons production of his own.\n\n\"Dangerous Acquaintances\" is an original English-language manga written Toren Smith and Adam Warren and illustrated by Warren, based on the Dirty Pair characters created by Haruka Takachiho. The series was originally published by Eclipse Comics between June 1989 and March 1990, and was first published in paperback and hardcover graphic novel format in 1991. With the transfer of the property rights to Dark Horse Comics, \"Dangerous Acquaintances\" was republished as a trade paperback in June 1997.\n\nThe 1997 reissue of the story features edited artwork for the chapters that comprise issues 3 through 5 of the original publication. The edits made were to Kei and Yuri's waitress costumes. In the original publication the costumes were Playboy Bunny costumes, though never referenced to as such specifically. In the 1997 reprint the ears and tails were digitally removed from all of the panels in which they appear, though in some panels the shadows on the walls behind the characters still have the ears and tails. While this edit went largely unnoticed, and was not mentioned in any press materials, the exact reason for the edits remains unclear but is probably due to Playboy owning the trademark to the Bunny Girl image and Dark Horse either not being able to obtain permission to use the images or afford the royalties for their use.\n\nThe Lovely Angels are on vacation on the planet of Rocinante when they spot an old \"acquaintance\", Shasti. Kei and Yuri immediately attack Shasti in a drunken rage, but are quickly subdued by the heavily armed and violent local police as Shasti blends into the crowd. Through a series of flashbacks interwoven though the story, the tale of the betrayal, attempted murder, and humiliation of the (then-rookie) pair by the increasingly psychotic superagent Shasti is told. The Lovely Angels start investigating Shasti's presence on the planet, and uncover a nest of apparently unconnected plots that all seem to have Shasti as the leader. Revolutionaries, a band of thieves after a collection of priceless antiques, and an experimental one-of-a-kind FTL drive installed in an interstellar liner filled with rich and influential potential hostages: which is Shasti's real goal and what is simply smokescreen? One thing is clear, though: the Dirty Pair want revenge against Shasti, and not even their reputation will bar the way!\n\n\"A Plague of Angels\" is the third original English-language manga version of Haruka Takachiho's Dirty Pair characters, written by Toren Smith and Adam Warren and illustrated by Warren. It was the last Dirty Pair comic that Smith and Warren co-wrote, Warren going on to handle all future writing for the series on his own. The series was originally published by Studio Proteus between August 1990 and November 1991, and has since been collected into a trade paperback, which was reissued by Dark Horse Comics in December 1995.\n\nAs public outrage peaks, the Angels are restricted to the Kalevala O'Neill Colony to help with local investigations of a technology-smuggling outfit. Meanwhile, the 3WA launches a full-scale public relations assault, commissioning a glowingly positive profile for \"High Sense\" magazine. As the Pair turn a routine stake-out into a free-for-all, ambitious reporter Cory Emerson takes the assignment. Cory arrives to find the Pair in trouble with security for the stake-out fiasco, which nonetheless has revealed the nature of their adversaries: artificial personalities encoded on micro-software plugs enabling the smugglers to move between host bodies. The Angels, with Cory in tow, go solo to crack the ring, but the smugglers unleash their secret weapon: a robot using a maniacal artificial personality that threatens to blow everyone up using a low-yield gravity bomb. The Pair successfully defeat the robot, but the bomb does not seem to be with it anymore.\n\n\"Sim Hell\" is the fourth original English-language manga version of Haruka Takachiho's Dirty Pair characters, written and illustrated by Adam Warren. It was the first Dirty Pair comic that saw Warren handle all the writing, having previously co-wrote with Toren Smith. The series was originally published by Dark Horse Comics between May and August 1993, and has since been collected into a trade paperback. Later, a colorized, reissued version (\"Sim Hell Remastered\") was published between May and August 2001.\n\nThe Lovely Angels report to the 3WA headquarters for Kei's annual evaluative assessment by the top-secret Central Computer, the 3WA's \"chief operating entity.\" Before any direct examination can take place, Kei must first participate via neural interface in several computer-generated interactive simulations, or \"sims.\" Something goes awry and Kei is seemingly trapped in a potentially lethal feedback loop with the computers running the simulation. Yuri jacks in to the sim's virtual reality to save Kei, but soon finds that both of them are now stuck in an endless series of simulations. Initially, the Angels struggle through historical sims, set decades earlier during the genocidal \"Nanoclysm,\" a plague of artificially intelligent Nanoviruses that nearly annihilated humanity. They discover that they are trapped in simulations belonging to the shadowy Bureau of Technological Regulation (BTR), a secretive group whose business is the control of certain dangerous technologies. Eventually, Kei and Yuri stumble upon a private sim owned by Kevin Sleet, their obnoxious tormentor from the BTR. There, they find that a rogue faction of the BTR, using supposedly forbidden technologies, intends to seize control of the 3WA's Central Computer and use its formidable powers to help mount a paramilitary coup of human civilization. But worst of all, the Angels discover that Sleet plans on a future where clones of Kei and Yuri serve as his personal harem. Nauseated, our heroines head for a final confrontation with the nefarious lout. They find the Central Computer is not without its own defenses.\n\n\"I Honestly Hate You\" is an eight-page short story originally published in August 1994 in the (annual) \"San Diego Comic Con Comics\" #3 (reprinted in 1998 by Dark Horse Comics in the \"Dirty Pair: Biohazards\" trade paperback).\n\nKei decides that she has had enough of dealing with Yuri's personality and derisive comments. She equips herself with fighting equipment and storms her room to teach her a lesson.\n\nThe black-and-white drawing style is reminiscent of Japanese manga, with heavy usage of gray-scale sheets, panels arriving to the edge of the pages on all four edges, kinetic lines showing movement, and some panels having no borders or being inclined to a side to show the direction of action.\n\n\"Fatal But Not Serious\" is the sixth original English-language manga version of Haruka Takachiho's Dirty Pair characters, written and illustrated by Adam Warren. The series was originally published by Dark Horse Comics between July and November 1995, and has since been collected into a trade paperback.\n\nWhile the majority of humanity still lives in fear of the Dirty Pair and their well-publicized \"disastrous proclivities,\" a surprising number of people have, for a wide variety of reasons, chosen to embrace the Lovely Angels as beloved, if destructive, \"idol figures.\" Recently, the Pair's galaxy-wide cult following has grown large enough to support an actual convention celebrating their dubious celebrity. In a doomed bid to generate some positive media coverage, the Lovely Angels themselves are attending this \"Kei'n'YuriCon '41\" as guests of honor... but their enemies are conspiring to derail this ill-fated \"charm offensive.\" Just before the convention, the Lovely Angels defeated a terrorist group in a bloody battle that left Kei with a broken leg. The surviving terrorist sought his revenge by unleashing a tailored \"neurovirus,\" designed to trigger an anti-Dirty Pair hysteria and mob violence at the convention. More ominously, a renegade branch of the 3WA has stolen the Lovely Angel's \"back-up copy\" personality constructs and tissue samples, generated a memory-intact clone of Yuri, and duped the freshly grown Angel into thinking she is undergoing an interactive simulation, a bizarre virtual reality scenario that requires her to assassinate the original Kei and Yuri. In typical Dirty Pair fashion, she is going to accomplish her mission beyond the shadow of a doubt... by causing the local sun to go supernova. Fortunately, the planetary authorities drew up plans to evacuate the system when they heard the Dirty Pair would be attending.\n\nThis series uses finished artwork that is inked and colored. The character designs use plain colors without gradients and shadows are done with zones of darker plain colors or with black zones, similar to anime. Cinetic lines are heavily used to represent movement, like Japanese manga. The environments are all futuristic.\n\n\"Start the Violence\" is a one-shot comic featuring the original English-language manga version of Haruka Takachiho's Dirty Pair characters, written and illustrated by Adam Warren. It was included in the \"Dirty Pair: Run From the Future\" trade paperback by Dark Horse Comics in January 2002. It was also published in three parts in \"Dark Horse Presents\" issues 132-134.\n\n\"Run from the Future\" is the eighth original English-language manga version of Haruka Takachiho's Dirty Pair characters, written and illustrated by Adam Warren. The series was originally published by Dark Horse Comics between January and April 2000, and has since been collected into a trade paperback.\n\nKei and Yuri, disguised as a pregnant Shasti and an overweight male model, with EPD (Explosive Personality Disorder) Eddie, travel to the covert trade and technology nexus of the Nimkasi, a Dyson tree habitat, where the 3WA have scored a deal with the Black Market habitat to poach 50 of the worst \"crims, terrs, and pirates\" from its megatree branches, in less than 100 minutes. Subduing, arresting, and battling with a sentient Smart Cloth \"Living Leather\" suit, a French post-human terrorist leader and his mechas, terrorist artists, bio-tattooed orcas, the blood-thirsty Teddy Roosevelt gladiator, Kei's schoolgirl crush, and Binky. The Lovely Angels may just pull off their first ever \"collateral damage\"-free mission, but a trip down memory lane for Yuri and Kei's own faith issues conspire against them. In the end, the Angels are successful (if only for a short while), but narrowly miss seeing the real Shasti.\n\n\"A Big 'Merci Beaucoup is a six-page story originally published from May to August 2001 in the back of each colorized reissue of \"Sim Hell\", and later in the back of the colorized \"Sim Hell\" reissued trade paperback (2002).\n\nThis short story consists of a series of flashbacks about how the relationship between Yuri and Kei has evolved over time. The flashbacks include events ranging from the time when both attended school to the current time, including, for example, their training at the 3WA.\n\nThe pages are greyscale reproductions of tight pencil \"layouts\", like the \"Empowered\" pages, and they are neither inked nor toned (tones are greyscale sheets, like those used in Japanese manga).\n\n"}

{"id": "2027949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2027949", "title": "Dargai", "text": "Dargai\n\nDargai (; ) is one of the administrative area of the Malakand District other being the Batkhela in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, located on the main highway from Peshawar to Swat, Dir and Chitral. The town of Dargai is experiencing an economic revival due to its well-known status as a hub for trade between the upper regions of Pakistan and the lower regions of Khyber Pakthunkhwa. It is also acknowledged economically as a major market for timber and historically as the last train station into Northern Pakistan.\n\nDargai was part of the Malakand Agency Tribal area until 1970 when the former princely states of (Chitral, Dir and Swat) were amalgamated into the Malakand Division, which was in turn divided into districts, one of which was the Malakand Protected Area, known as Malakand District. In 2000 the Malakand Division was abolished and despite constitutional changes since 1970, the expression \"Malakand Agency\" is sometimes still used as a name for the entire area of the former agency.\n\nThe British commenced their campaign against Malakand in 1852, and Dargai became well known for its battles during their rule. First, the British conducted a campaign against the Pashtun Utmankhel tribe and a large battle took place at Prang Ghar. Owing to its defenders being only a small band of poorly armed \"mujahideen\", the Utmankhel were subdued. In March 1852, a brigade was sent after them under the command of Lord Clyde, which raided Dargai and Kharkeay – small villages of the Ranizai tribe at the bottom of the Malakand Pass. The attackers were well equipped with artillery, so the Ranizais accepted a ransom of Rs.5000 and thereafter proclaimed \"jihad\" or holy war in the Buner Valley, at that time ruled by Syed Akhbar Shah Badshah. The British felt threatened by Badshah and made an unsuccessful attempt to take the valley.\n\nSwat ruler Akhund Sahib (Saidu baba) died in 1877, and the following year the British commander took a strong force and entered Ranizai territory via Palai and Sherkhana at the southern boundary of the Malakand Agency when the Ranizais once more resorted to arbitration.\n\nIn 1895, British army major Sir Arlo along with Colonel Kelly started a war against Umara Khan, a \"sardar\" and politician whom Winston Churchill called \"the Afghan Napoleon\". The British camped at Dargai and Kharkay before a huge battle in the Malakand pass during which the Swat Ranizais displayed great valour. On September 12, 1895 an agreement was signed between the British and the Swat Ranizais.\n\nThe second battle of Malakand took place in 1897 during a period of Swat Ranizais resistance when even the \"Pukhtoon\" women came out to fight. History records the valour of a woman belonging to a respectable family of Dehri Alladand who fought day and night as well as provided food and water to the \"mujahideen\" and who died with her sword drawn. She is buried on the outskirts of Dehri Alladand village where the people refer to her as \"Shaheeda Abai\" (martyred grandmother).\n\nHazrat Sadullah Khan, alias Sar tor Faqir (\"bear-headed Faqir\"), also known as Mullah Mastan or the Mad Mullah by the British, was a tribesman of the Buner Swat. When the British seized Amandara, Sar tor Faqir marched from Landakay towards Thana the British proceeded to Dehri Alladand and the Batkhela. They by-passed the British troops at Amandara and decided to raid Malakand, where they defeated the British. Later, the Sikhs joined the British, but still they were still beaten by the \"mujadeen'. When the battle ended a large number of British and Sikhs had been killed or captured, and a large quantity of arms and ammunition seized. Nineteen \"mujahideen\" were killed, including Sar Tor Faqir. His tomb stands at the bottom of Elephant Pass (Hathi Darrah) to the south of the village of Zulamkot in Dehri Alladand in Malakand.\n\nLater on, the British formed a new force known as the Malakand Field Force to deal with the tribes of Malakand, a force in which Winston Churchill was a second lieutenant. He was also the editor of the daily Civil and Military Gazette. The Malakand Field Force raided many villages in Malakand including Swat, Dir and Chitral. Thereafter British rule gradually enveloped the whole area.\n\nIn recent history, specifically November 2006, insurgents attacked a group of soldiers during their parade, many were killed and many more still were injured. The civilians in the surrounding area quickly drove the injured soldiers to the hospital thereby saving many lives. The people of Dargai are also known for providing water, refreshment, and even accommodation in their own homes to people fleeing the violence in the North from 2009-2012, and also to people escaping the floods in July of 2010\n\nAn attack on Dargai Heights during the Tirah campaign resulted in the award of four Victoria Crosses.

He is a member of the original expedition from Earth to the Ancient city of Atlantis in the Pegasus galaxy, which he joined after turning down a job at Masaryk University in his home country Czech Republic. His expertise on Ancient technology is only surpassed by Dr. Rodney McKay, with whom he shares a friendly rivalry. Zelenka's planned one-time appearance in the season 1 episode \"Thirty-Eight Minutes\" was followed by a recurring role for expository scenes with McKay and the leader of the expedition. Zelenka has since appeared in approximately half of each season's episodes and also appeared in the crossover episode \"The Pegasus Project\" of \"Stargate SG-1\". The series finale of \"Atlantis\", \"Enemy at the Gate\", marks his last appearance. For his portrayal of Radek Zelenka, David Nykl was nominated for a 2005 Leo Award in the category \"Dramatic Series: Best Supporting Performance by a Male\".\n\nDr. Radek Zelenka is a careful and precise scientist of the original Atlantis Expedition who often supplements the scientific decisions of the \"equally brainy\" Dr. Rodney McKay, with whom he has a friendly rivalry. He frequently appears in the control room with McKay and the leader of the Atlantis expedition for expository scenes to lay out an episode's premise to the audience, and is \"a key player in helping the Atlantis team stay one step ahead of the bad guys as well as solving some of its most perplexing scientific conundrums\". GateWorld's David Read felt that while Zelenka may \"play second fiddle to Rodney\", he is also \"the only one who even has the potential to put McKay down.\" Actor David Nykl explained that Zelenka has \"reasonably well honed social skills\" and \"can put up with a lot of stress [...] and a lot of pressure, particularly from McKay and the situations that he can get into\", but he may be too focused and determined to get one thing done.\n\nZelenka recurs in all five seasons of \"Stargate Atlantis\" and is also among the \"Atlantis\" characters to appear in the \"Stargate SG-1\" crossover episode \"The Pegasus Project\". In his first appearance in the early \"Atlantis\" season 1 episode \"Thirty-Eight Minutes\", Zelenka helps devise a plan to free Major Sheppard's team including Dr. McKay from a potentially lethal technical problem. After a first short collaboration in \"Suspicion\", Zelenka and McKay are the driving forces in finding a solution to protect the city of Atlantis from a massive hurricane in \"The Storm\".\n\n\"Hot Zone\" reveals that Zelenka has been given the ATA gene therapy to enable him to operate Ancient technology, but the therapy had no effect on him. Season 2's \"Duet\" shows Zelenka off-world for the first time, where he needs to save McKay and a soldier from being captured in a Wraith dart. Following a major dispute about an experimental Ancient power generator in \"Trinity\", McKay apologizes to Zelenka when the experiment causes the death of a scientist. McKay saves Zelenka from certain death in \"Tao of Rodney\" and later apologizes for so often putting him down, admitting that Zelenka is \"a brilliant scientist and a decent human being\". Zelenka last appears in the series finale of \"Atlantis\", \"Enemy at the Gate\", where he implements a wormhole drive that sends the city of Atlantis from the Pegasus Galaxy to Earth within seconds.\n\nFrom the beginning of \"Stargate Atlantis\", the producers were looking for actors to play non-Americans to present the cooperation between different nations and other groups of people in an alien environment. In fact, although in the series it is possible to see soldiers and technicians wearing in their uniforms flags that identify them as Russians, Japanese, South Africans, Belgians, Germans, Britons, Spaniards, etc, all main and secondary characters of earthly origin, except Zelenka, are Anglo-Saxons: Americans, a Canadian and a Scotsman.\n\nWhen actor David Nykl mentioned his Czech Canadian background during his audition for a Russian character for the season 1 episode \"Thirty-Eight Minutes\", the producers changed the character's nationality to Czech and cast him. Nykl made such an impression that producer Brad Wright wrote Zelenka into the Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) scenes of the next episode, \"Suspicion\".\n\nZelenka was re-introduced in the mid-season-1 finale \"The Storm\", Martin Gero's second \"Atlantis\" episode. Gero had had difficulty with laying out the dangers of the storm and its solution in a quick and entertaining manner with just the McKay character, and Brad Wright was not opposed to introducing another expository character. Zelenka has since frequently appeared for expository scenes in the control room with McKay and the leader of the Atlantis expedition. Zelenka's given name is first mentioned by McKay in the season 1 finale \"The Siege\"; McKay had previously been unable to remember Zelenka's name. The producers chose \"Radek\", a fairly common Czech given name, without input from Nykl. When Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) replaced Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) as the leader of the Atlantis expedition in season 4, the producers shifted the emphasis of Zelenka's collaboration with McKay to his interaction with Carter. By the end of the show's run, the interactions between Zelenka and McKay become more subtle to the point where they finish each other's sentences and need fewer words and expressions to get by.\n\nPortraying a recurring character, David Nykl was not under contract and neither knew his number of episodes nor his character's story arc in advance. Nevertheless, he appeared in approximately half of each season's episodes. No scenes with Zelenka were cut in the first two seasons of \"Atlantis\", and extra scenes involving Zelenka were shot in the first episodes of the season 3 to fill time. However, all of David Nykl's scenes were cut from the season 5 episode \"The Shrine\" due to time constraints, although Nykl's credits appear in the finished episode.\n\nSince Zelenka's first appearance, David Nykl's fluent Czech was worked into \"Stargate Atlantis\" as part of Zelenka. Approximately half of Zelenka's Czech lines were scripted (in English), which Nykl then translated verbatim. The other half was ad-libbed and usually included swearing. His usual Czech exclamations include Ty vole and Do prdele. Nykl normally speaks with a Canadian accent, but Zelenka had a thick Czech accent; Nykl found it increasingly hard to remember to put on the accent as the show went on. The late season 1 episode \"Letters from Pegasus\" features a minute-long non-subtitled monologue in which Zelenka describes the city of Atlantis in his mothertongue. Nykl translated the scripted monologue at home and performed it in Czech the next day. A version in English was initially planned to be filmed but was dropped after Nykl's successful first take. The end of Zelenka's video message (\"drž se miláčku\" – \"take care, darling\") was ad-libbed, but Nykl left it to the writers to create Zelenka's backstory. But during the show's run, Zelenka only ever mentions having a brother, a sister, and a nephew, and is never shown to be or have been in a romantic relationship.\n\nOften informing his superiors of critical situations, Zelenka earned the nickname \"Mr. Bad News\" among fans. In an interview with David Nykl, TheScifiWorld's Gilles Nuytens referred to Zelenka as a \"popular\" and \"interesting\" character, and compared Zelenka's appearances in \"Atlantis\" to those of the \"Stargate SG-1\" character Walter Harriman, \"a bit like the icing on the cake\". Another interviewer mentioned that, following a \"warm reception\", the \"fans have really taken [Zelenka] to heart\". When \"GateWorld\" hypothesized that viewers were looking forward to an episode where the \"underdog\" Zelenka saves the day instead of McKay, Nykl replied that the set-up dynamic earns the character more sympathy from the audience. For his portrayal of Radek Zelenka, David Nykl was nominated for a 2005 Leo Award in the category \"Dramatic Series: Best Supporting Performance by a Male\".\n"}

Coffey in command.\n\nSoon after commissioning, \"Toucey\" began duty with the Atlantic Fleet as a unit of Division 42, Flotilla 7, Squadron 1. Based at Newport, Rhode Island, for the next seven years, she operated along the eastern seaboard and in the West Indies. During the summer, the destroyer patrolled the northern latitudes off the New England coast, training in destroyer operations. Each winter, she headed south for the annual fleet concentration held in waters near the Panama Canal and for gunnery training at the range near Puerto Rico. Sometime between 1 July 1921 and 1 January 1922, she was reassigned to Division 25 of Squadron 9 and began operating with only 50 percent of her normal complement. However, by 1 January 1923, her full complement had been restored and, still assigned to the same squadron and division; she began operating with the newly organized Scouting Force.\n\nLate in 1926, she appears to have been temporarily assigned to the American naval forces operating in Europe. By 1 January 1927, her base of operations had been moved from Newport, to Norfolk, Virginia. From the sketchy records which exist, she appears to have served the remainder of her career with the Scouting Force destroyers operating out of Norfolk.\n\nIn the spring of 1930, she moved to Philadelphia to prepare for inactivation. On 1 May 1930, \"Toucey\" was decommissioned at Philadelphia. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 22 October. The former destroyer was sold on 17 January 1931 and scrapped sometime in 1934.\n\nAs of 2019, no other ships have been named \"Toucey\". was launched as \"Toucey\", but her name was changed prior to commissioning at the request of her namesake.\n\n"}

He is one of three division heads of the California Aikido Association and holds a teaching certification signed by Morihei Ueshiba and Kisshomaru Ueshiba. He is also the founder and head instructor of City Aikido of San Francisco, Aikido of San Jose, and Aikido of Mountain View, CA.\n\nNadeau is well known as a pioneer in the energy and awareness aspects of aikido, having committed his martial arts career to understanding and translating these principles handed down by Ueshiba into fields beyond aikido, including psychotherapy, personal development, performance, and business.\n\nIn addition to his enrollment as an Aikido student at Hombu Dojo from 1960-1962 and maintaining a full training and meditation practice during his time in Japan, Nadeau had a close and substantial off-the-mat relationship with Morihei Ueshiba, which included regular extended trips to the Japanese countryside. Nadeau also assumed the position of publisher of an English-language newsletter about aikido while studying in Japan. Through the format of asking questions during small and sometimes private meetings, Nadeau learned first-hand some of the ideas and philosophies that Ueshiba wished to pass on to interested students. Fundamental among these teachings was the concept of \"two forces\" that combine to produce a new identity and \"levels\" which progress from limited to enhanced capabilities and awareness. Nadeau refers to the process of moving from one level to the next as an Alchemical transformation. According to Nadeau, this progression occurs in the \"functioning realm\", i.e. in a manner that improves functioning in everyday life.\n\nMorihei Ueshiba spoke of Izanagi (male) and Izanami (female), the two great forces that, in Shinto mythology, created the islands of Japan. Or again, he spoke of Fire - Water - Steam as another example of two forces combining to yield a third transformed entity. These alchemical concepts have infused Nadeau's teaching since his return from his studies with Ueshiba in Japan in the early 1960s. As a reminder of these direct transmissions, Ueshiba presented Nadeau with a scroll that translates as \"Do the aikido that cannot be seen with the human eye\".\n\n\nNadeau travels around the world regularly teaching workshops across the United States, Switzerland, Israel and New Zealand\n\n\n"}

However, the jail earned infamy after the killings of four political leaders — A. H. M.

{"id": "2028013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028013", "title": "Fort Miles", "text": "Fort Miles\n\nFort Miles was a United States Army installation located on Cape Henlopen near Lewes, Delaware. Although funds to build the fort were approved in 1934, it was 1941 before construction began on the fort. On 3 June 1941 it was named for Lieutenant General Nelson A. Miles. As the primary fort of the Harbor Defenses of the Delaware, it was built to defend Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and to protect domestic shipping from enemy fire between Cape May and Cape Henlopen, particularly from the German surface fleet. The fort also operated a controlled underwater minefield to prevent ships entering the Delaware River estuary. One of these mines was revealed following 2016 Hurricane Hermine by local Cape Henlopen state park staff. The sea mine and anchor were archaeologically conserved.\n\nBy 1950 the Army's coast defense role had been transferred to the Navy and coastal artillery defenses were obsolete with the fort becoming surplus. The Army continued to use portions and in 1962 the Navy established Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Lewes, a Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) shore terminal there to replace the one at Cape May across the bay in New Jersey that was damaged in a storm. The NAVFAC was in commission 1 May 1962 to 30 September 1981. The headquarters building now houses the Biden Environmental Conference Center. \n\nThe fort is now is Cape Henlopen State Park.\n\nIn 1917 a single gun was placed on Cape Henlopen, with another at the Cape May Military Reservation in New Jersey. These were removed after the war.\n\nPrior to World War II the Harbor Defenses of the Delaware consisted primarily of Fort Saulsbury near Slaughter Beach, Delaware, accepted for service in 1924. This fort had four guns on long-range carriages, but was unaccompanied by smaller guns. It had effectively replaced several forts much further upriver, centered on Fort Delaware near Delaware City, though these remained armed until Fort Miles was built in World War II. The Delaware River was one of the coast defense areas of the US that most demonstrated the tendency of defenses to move seaward as gun range increased. The outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 and the Fall of France in June 1940 greatly accelerated US defense planning and funding. On 27 July 1940 the Army's Harbor Defense Board recommended the construction of 27 (eventually 38) two-gun batteries to protect strategic points along the US coastline, to be casemated against air attack. Two of these batteries were to be at Fort Miles, initially called the Cape Henlopen Military Reservation. Construction on the first one, Battery 118 (later named Battery Smith, after Major General William Ruthven Smith), began on 24 March 1941.\n\nThe first operational guns at the fort were four mobile guns, which deployed to the fort on 15 April 1941 with two partial batteries of the 21st Coast Artillery Regiment. Concrete \"Panama mounts\" for these were completed in June 1942. On 5 June 1941 elements of the 261st Coast Artillery Battalion of the Delaware National Guard arrived.\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor accelerated construction and other activity at the fort. The United States declaration of war on Japan compelled the U.S. Army to continue to garrison the fort with the 261st Coast Artillery Battalion, who days before were slated to leave. Fourteen vessels, including USS \"Jacob Jones\", a U.S. Navy destroyer, were sunk off the coast of New Jersey during the first six months of 1942. Numerous batteries (ranging from guns up to ) were installed at the fort and a large mine field was laid in the waters off Lewes, Delaware in the following years, but the fort was to see no action during the conflict. In May 1945, the soldiers would receive the surrender of \"U-858\", a German U-boat that was part of Wolfpack Seewolf at the time of the German surrender to Allied forces in Europe. The \"U-858\" was the first enemy ship to surrender to United States forces following the defeat of Germany in World War II\n\nOn 14 March 1942 Battery C of the 52nd Coast Artillery (CA) (Railway) regiment arrived with four railway guns. By 10 September this battery was joined by Battery D with the same armament; Batteries C and D were initially the 2nd Battalion of the 52nd CA, and were redesignated as the 287th Coast Artillery (Railway) Battalion on 1 May 1943. Another early battery was the \"examination battery\", Battery 5 of four guns, completed 31 August 1942 and transferred for use 11 December 1943. Two guns each were taken from Fort Delaware and Fort Wadsworth, New York for this battery. In October 1942 the structure of Battery 118 (Smith) was completed, and in December 1942 the guns were mounted, but the battery was not transferred for use until 21 December 1943.\n\nIn late 1942 construction had yet to begin on Battery 119, the second gun battery at the fort. Battery 119 was cancelled and replaced with Battery 519, a casemated battery of two guns relocated from Fort Saulsbury. Construction began on Battery 519 on 15 November 1942, was completed on 31 August 1943, and the battery was transferred for use on 15 February 1944.\n\nBatteries 221 (Herring) and 222 (Hunter) were completed in August 1943 and October 1943, and transferred in March 1944 and December 1943, respectively. Each of these had two guns on high-angle shielded barbette carriages, with a concrete-and-earth bunker for ammunition and fire control.\n\nTwo gun Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) batteries were at Fort Miles as AMTB 5A and AMTB 5B. These were dual-purpose (anti-surface and anti-aircraft) guns. Each battery was authorized two guns on fixed mounts, two on towed mounts, and two single Bofors guns, although the weapons on hand may have varied. Both were completed in June 1943 and transferred in December 1943.\n\nFort Miles was supplemented by three batteries at the Cape May Military Reservation in New Jersey. The first was Battery 25 with four guns on Panama mounts, built in 1942. Battery 223, a battery similar to Batteries 221 and 222 at Fort Miles, was built in 1943. A gun battery was also built at Cape May in 1943.\n\nAt its peak, Fort Miles was home to over 2,200 soldiers, men and women, including the 261st Coast Artillery Battalion, the 21st Coast Artillery Regiment, part of the 52nd Coast Artillery (Railway), and a detachment of the 113th Infantry Regiment.\n\nFort Miles never saw any major action during World War II, firing its guns many times in practice and achieving high marksmanship ratings but never using those guns to engage an enemy. A gun was fired exactly once in testing, and the resulting recoil damaged the emplacement, resulting in no further shells fired from Battery Smith.\n\nFire control towers, four- to five-story round-base concrete towers with flat observation decks, were set up along the coast as baselines to triangulate the position of suspicious ships or submarines. Five such towers still exist within the current boundaries of Cape Henlopen State Park, including one (#7) that has visitor access. Many bunkers were also constructed to house guns and other weapons. Barracks, administration buildings, and a pier were also constructed as part of the fort.\n\nWith a significantly reduced threat from enemy surface forces, in March 1944 the first of several drawdowns at Fort Miles commenced. The Headquarters and Headquarters Battery (HHB) of the 261st Coast Artillery Battalion (CA Bn) moved to Fort Jackson, South Carolina in March and was inactivated there on 20 April, with personnel transferred to field artillery units. The remainder of the 261st CA Bn became components of the 21st CA at Fort Miles. In April 1944 the 8-inch railway gun battalion (287th CA Bn) relocated to Fort Bragg, North Carolina and was reorganized as a field artillery battalion. In October 1944 the 21st CA was itself reduced to a battalion with the same number and placed under the Eastern Defense Command, and on 1 April 1945 was inactivated, with remaining personnel at Fort Miles transferring to the Harbor Defenses of the Delaware.\n\nThe four largest coastal batteries at Fort Miles are Battery 118 (Battery Smith), Battery 221 (Battery Herring), Battery 222 (Battery Hunter), and Battery 519. Due to the late date of its completion, Battery 519 was never formally named and was only designated by its Army Corps of Engineers construction number.\n\nMost of Fort Miles was declared surplus in 1948 and 1949, but the Army continued to use portions of it through the early 1990s as a morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) area for active and retired military personnel and their families, with the facility coming under the management of Fort Meade. In 1964, 543 acres (2.2 km²) of federal land were donated to the State of Delaware to establish Cape Henlopen State Park. Over time, more land was transferred to the state park until Fort Miles ceased operation as a military MWR facility altogether in 1991, as part of the BRAC process. Fort Miles, consisting of approximately 96 acres, was transferred to the State of Delaware only for public park or recreational purposes. The State of Delaware reimbursed the Army Morale, Welfare and Recreational fund $14,369 for expenses expended to improve the property. Its last official usage was as a bivouac for soldiers who had just returned from the first Gulf War.\n\nIn 1962, the U.S. Navy took control of a portion of the southern end of Fort Miles, including Batteries Smith and Herring, to establish Naval Facility Lewes (NAVFAC Lewes), a Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) shore terminal. The terminus had been at Cape May, New Jersey until damaged in the \"Ash Wednesday\" Storm and that station's equipment had been shipped across to Fort Miles by Navy LST. The Terminal Building was at Battery Herring with administration and barracks facilities further north. The array was reconnected at Lewes by the cable ship \"Neptune\". NAVFAC Lewes would continue to operate until 30 September 1981. Since the SOSUS program was not officially declassified until 1991, the actual operations of NAVFAC Lewes remained classified for the duration of the facility's existence. The headquarters building that also contained some quarters, eating and recreation facilities, became a Naval Reserve Center until all land was returned to the state in 1996. That building remains as the Biden Environmental Conference Center. A married housing complex became facilities for the University of Delaware College of Earth, Ocean and Environmental Sciences.\n\nBattery Smith originally housed the two guns and is now in use by Cape Henlopen State Park for storage. A 16\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun formerly on has been remounted at Fort Miles as a commemorative display; as of December 2018 part of the wreckage from was planned to be added. Battery Herring, originally covered with sand like all the other batteries, was excavated and expanded for use as NAVFAC Lewes. That structure was removed with the former administration and barracks facility now a conference center. Battery Hunter is in use currently as a Hawk Watch station. Battery 519 originally housed two guns. It is currently being renovated for use as a museum, celebrating Delaware's part in World War II. Tours began in 2004. It has a restored 12-inch gun similar to the original mounted at the south gun block. Additionally, it is being used to house a German-built 20 mm anti-aircraft cannon, captured from \"U-858\" after its surrender. A former railway gun, converted as a test weapon, is also on site. Four Panama mounts still exist at Battery 22, located near the Beach House within the park. Walking tours of the bunkers and other facilities currently being restored are available during the summer. The project falls under the purview of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). Historic interpreters can be seen at the park during special events. These events are designed to give the public a demonstration of military life at Fort Miles when it was still in operation.

In such circumstances, consultants or specific technology training is usually required, as the organization lacks the internal skills or experience with the technologies that it expects to be using soon.\n\nIn government, for example, citizen use of the Internet and the increased availability of teleworkers has presented special challenges and opportunities, typically called \"e-government\". At the same time, internal operational efficiencies have become more of a priority due to rising competition between jurisdictions. Often the first step is to limit the number of different departments or agencies involved. By \"consolidating the technology operations of 91 state agencies into the Virginia Information Technology Agency, the State of Virginia estimates an eventual savings of nearly $100 million a year.\" - \n\n\"Similarly, the U.S. National Performance Review recommended a data processing consolidation and modernization initiative citing industry experience suggesting operational savings of between 30% and 50%.\" - \n\nWhile \"California is the cradle of the information technology industry\" its own state government claims that \"collaborative exploration and exploitation of emerging technologies is extremely rare within state government\", accordingly it seeks to \"improve customer relationships through online services.\" However such efforts tend to rely very much on driving personalities and leadership. After one resignation, the state \"lost the vision and executive sponsorship that contributed to its success and the national recognition of California's emerging eGovernment activities.\" This is a major problem in all technology alignment.\n\nIn Canada, a similar nationwide effort called Service Canada has similar goals, and has run into similar problems: \"The big complaints are that departments fight over their turf and are organized to serve the bureaucracy, not Canadians. They don’t share data, information, common infrastructure, technology or integrate their business processes. Senior bureaucrats are often accused of being out of touch with the needs of Canadians.\" - The government claims that it \"is expected to save C$3 billion over five years by automating manual operations, consolidating call centres and reducing overpayments in Canada Pension Plan and employment service.\" It \"will need to spend about C$500 million for technology, consolidate or move offices and retrain the thousands of workers whose jobs were eliminated by automation.\"\n\nWhen, as in California or Canada, new leadership and massive change to operations is required, technology alignment may simply excuse a massive business process reengineering and downsizing exercise. This too is a common situation in technology alignment: using the fact of new technology as a pretext for other large changes.\n\nHowever, as with all such exercises, there are claims that better service will result, by (in Canada) \"opening new offices and creating more front-line jobs in local communities\" or (in California) \"a 20% reduction in the workforce performing shared services\" and of \"nearly 9,000 state employees... about 3,600 are engaged in common core functions. An eventual 20% reduction in this workforce segment is possible through attrition when phased in over 5 years.\" - \n\nThese claims also are fairly typical: despite a longstanding admission among experts that there is a \"productivity paradox\", the introduction of new information technology and more automated work processes are always assumed to be \"more efficient\" than what they replace. Accordingly, technology alignment is probably not a passing fad, but, seems to be driven by factors built into business and technology culture.\n\n"}

In their own era they were known colloquially as the Queen's Men — as were Queen Elizabeth's Men and Queen Henrietta's Men, in theirs.\n\nThe group was formed on the accession of James I in 1603, and named after its patron, James's wife Anne of Denmark. It was a combination of two previously-existing companies, Oxford's Men and Worcester's Men. Among the company's most important members were Christopher Beeston, its manager, and Thomas Heywood, the actor-dramatist who wrote many of its plays, including \"The Rape of Lucrece\" (printed 1608) and \"The Golden Age\" (printed 1611). William Kempe finished his career with this company, though he died c. 1603.\n\nIn 1604, ten members of the new-formed company were granted the sum of four and a half pounds each, to buy red cloth for their livery for the 15 March coronation procession. The ten were Beeston, Heywood, Richard Perkins, Thomas Greene, John Duke, James Holt, Robert Beeston, Robert Lee, Robert Pallant, and Thomas Swinerton. The same ten men are listed in a license granted to the company in 1609 (though Pallant is misnamed \"Richard\").\n\nRichard Perkins would develop into the company's leading actor, and acquire a reputation as a major tragedian. John Duke had come to Worcester's from the Lord Chamberlain's Men, along with Christopher Beeston, in 1602. Little is known of Robert Beeston, though the common name suggests he was a relative of Christopher. (Pairs of relatives were not uncommon in acting troupes in this era: the brothers John and Laurence Dutton in Oxford's Men and Queen Elizabeth's Men in the 1580s; Anthony and Humphrey Jeffes in the Admiral's/Prince Henry's Men in the early 17th century. Robert Pallant, the son of the man in Queen Anne's, would play female roles for the King's Men c. 1620.)\n\nThomas Greene was the company's major comedian; he was reputed to have once portrayed a baboon onstage. Greene was so closely identified with his role as Bubble in a 1611 play that the play became indelibly renamed \"Greene's Tu Quoque\".\n\nA host of other actors were in the company over its tenure. See Richard Baxter and William Robbins for examples.\n\nQueen Anne's Men originally performed at the Curtain Theatre — they acted \"The Travels of the Three English Brothers,\" by William Rowley, John Day, and George Wilkins, there in 1607; but they also acted the same play at the Red Bull Theatre in Clerkenwell that same year, becoming the first company to play there. John Webster's tragedy \"The White Devil\" received a disastrous premiere at the Red Bull on an overcast winter day in 1612.\n\nDespite their royal patronage, Queen Anne's Men appear to have performed only sporadically at Court in their first decade — something less than once a year on average. On 12 and 13 January 1612, the company joined with the King's Men for Court performances of two Queen's company's plays, \"The Silver Age\" and \"The Rape of Lucrece\". Queen Anne's Men played twice more at Court in the winter of 1613–14, three times in the following winter, and four times in 1615–16. They toured widely every summer throughout this period.\n\nThe company acquired a reputation for playing relatively unsophisticated drama for a rowdy audience. [For more on their theatre and its audience, see: \"Swetnam the Woman-Hater\". Yet their style of drama had some surprising aspects. They were creative in terms of special effects: consider these stage directions from Heywood's \"The Silver Age,\" written for and acted by the company —\n\n\nIn 1617 the company moved to the Cockpit Theatre, in the increasingly fashionable Drury Lane. This final move, which brought significantly higher admission prices, engendered indignation among their audience: the Cockpit was set on fire during a Shrove Tuesday riot in 1617 and had to be rebuilt. The Queen's troupe seems to have remained at the Cockpit for only a relatively brief time; within a couple of years they were back at the Red Bull.\n\nThe actors lost their patron at the death of Queen Anne in 1619; they continued on as the Company of the Revels, often known simply as the Red Bull Company after their theatre. Their final years were marked by a major legal dispute: Thomas Greene's widow, remarried as Susan Baskervile, sued for moneys owed her through her late husband's share in the troupe and loans she had extended over the years. The outcome of the so-called Baskerville or Worth/Baskerville suit was that the actors lost and the company was forced to dissolve in 1623.\n\nSome members moved on to other troupes; Richard Perkins, for example, would acquire a reputation as perhaps the major tragedian of his generation while acting with Queen Henrietta's Men from 1625 to 1642. Christopher Beeston would attain prominence as the dominant theatre manager and impresario of the 1620s and 1630s.\n"}

He is best known for his 2002 summer club hit \"Satisfaction.\"\n\nHe started his career as DJ along with his cousin Alessandro \"Alle\" Benassi, forming the electronica duo Benassi Bros. Although he began to gain popularity with his pseudonym in 1997 by releasing the song \"Electric Flying\", his first international hit was \"I Feel So Fine\", launched in 2001 under the nickname KMC.\n\nIn 2003, Benassi released his first solo debut album, \"Hypnotica\", to positive reviews. It incorporates electroclash sounds and many elements of house music, and won the European Border Breakers Award. The following year, the debut album of the Benassi Bros., \"Pumphonia\", was released. Their track \"Illusion\" became very popular in the American club scene, finally peaking at number 4 on Hot Dance Club Play. Following \"Hit My Heart\" peaked at 15.\n\nIn 2008, his remix of Public Enemy's \"Bring the Noise\" won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording at the 50th Grammy Awards. In 2009, Benassi also entered the Top 100 DJs list from \"DJ Mag\" at #26, while in 2011 was rated #7 on DJ Poll Top 100 by \"DJ List\" web site.\n\nA native of Milan and raised in Reggio Emilia, DJ and producer Benassi, started DJing alongside cousin Alle Benassi in the late 1980s in their hometown, before moving to Larry Pignagnoli's Off Limits production studio in the mid-1990s, creating music for various acts, including Whigfield, J.K. and Ally & Jo. In 2001, Benassi, under the name KMC, released his first hit called \"I Feel So Fine\", with vocals by Dhany. The track first climbed the charts in Benassi's native Italy, and soon became a #1 hit in the UK club charts.\n\nMoving from house to electro, \"Satisfaction\" took Benassi's success worldwide a year later with high-profile DJs like Carl Cox, Darren Emerson, and Roger Sanchez offering praises. The track reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart after the Ministry of Sound record company replaced the original video (an almost still picture of the band, overlaid with graphics) with a video of models using power tools.\n\nIn 2003 Benny Benassi released his first solo debut album \"Hypnotica\" (he won the European Border Breakers Award in 2005 which racked up the most sales for an Italian album outside Italy).\n\nBenassi often works with vocalists Paul French and Violeta, who are collectively known as The Biz. He produced a group with cousin Alle, called Benassi Bros., a project designed to shine the spotlight on the two Biz vocalists, Paul French and Violeta Claudia and other guest singers. A year after the release of \"Hypnotica\", the album \"Pumphonia\" marked their first full-length release, and in 2005, Benassi Bros. released their second album \"…Phobia\".\n\nSome of Benassi's singles have charted high in the United Kingdom and have been played worldwide in clubs. Remixes for OutKast, Goldfrapp, and Felix da Housecat followed. Benassi also remixes music of his contemporaries, such as Tomcraft and Fischerspooner.\n\nIn 2005, Benassi founded the record label Pump-Kin Music. The focus of the label is primarily new and unsigned producers. The stated aim of the venture is to give exposure to some of the lesser known DJ/production talent across the world.\n\nIn August 2007, Benassi released a remix of Public Enemy's \"Bring the Noise\".

{"id": "2028055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028055", "title": "Productivity paradox", "text": "Productivity paradox\n\nThe productivity paradox refers to the slowdown in productivity growth in the United States in the 1970s and 80s despite rapid development in the field of information technology (IT) over the same period. As highlighted in a widely cited article by Erik Brynjolfsson, productivity growth slowed down at the level of the whole U.S. economy, and often within individual sectors that had invested heavily in IT, despite dramatic advances in computer power and increasing investment in IT. Similar trends were seen in many other nations. While the computing capacity of the U.S. increased a hundredfold in the 1970s and 1980s, labor productivity growth slowed from over 3% in the 1960s to roughly 1% in the 1980s. This perceived paradox was popularized in the media by analysts such as Steven Roach and later Paul Strassman. The concept is sometimes referred to as the Solow computer paradox in reference to Robert Solow's 1987 quip, \"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\" The paradox has been defined as a perceived \"discrepancy between measures of investment in information technology and measures of output at the national level.\"\n\nMany observers disagree that any meaningful \"productivity paradox\" exists and others, while acknowledging the disconnect between IT capacity and spending, view it less as a paradox than a series of unwarranted assumptions about the impact of technology on productivity. In the latter view, this disconnect is emblematic of our need to understand and do a better job of deploying the technology that becomes available to us rather than an arcane paradox that by its nature is difficult to unravel. Some point to historical parallels with the steam engine and with electricity, where the dividends of a productivity-enhancing disruptive technology were reaped only slowly, with an initial lag, over the course of decades, due to the time required for the technologies to diffuse into common use, and due to the time required to reorganize around and master efficient use of the new technology. As with previous technologies, an extremely large number of initial cutting-edge investments in IT were counterproductive and over-optimistic. Some modest IT-based gains may have been difficult to detect amid the apparent overall slowing of productivity growth, which is generally attributed to one or more of a variety of non-IT factors, such as oil shocks, increased regulation or other cultural changes, a hypothetical decrease in labor quality, a hypothetical exhaustion or slowdown in non-IT innovation, and/or a coincidence of sector-specific problems.\n\nAcademic studies of aggregate U.S. data from the 1970s and 1980s failed to find evidence that IT significantly increased overall productivity. However, the 1990s saw evidence of a delayed IT-related productivity jump, arguably resolving the original paradox; the broader issue of what measurable factors best explain the dramatic productivity ups-and-downs of the past two hundred years, as well as whether the rate of productivity growth is more likely to increase or to decrease in the decades ahead, remains a subject of contentious study.\n\nSeveral authors have explained the paradox in different ways. In his original article, Brynjolfsson (1993) identified four categories to group the various explanations proposed:\n\nHe explained the first two explanations as \"shortcomings in research, not practice as the root of the productivity paradox.\" He then stated that \"a more pessimistic view is embodied in the other two explanations. They propose that there really are no major benefits\". Brynjolfsson explores these ideas in detail and poses the paradox as an economic problem: Do benefits justify past and continued investment in information technology?\n\nTurban, et al. (2008), state that understanding the paradox requires an understanding of the concept of productivity. Pinsonneault et al. (1998) state that, to untangle the paradox, an “understanding of how IT usage is related to the nature of managerial work and the context in which it is deployed” is required.\n\nOne hypothesis to explain the productivity paradox is that computers are productive, yet their productive gains are realized only after a lag period, during which complementary capital investments must be developed to allow for the use of computers to their full potential.\n\nDiminishing marginal returns from computers, the opposite of the time lag hypothesis, is that computers, in the form of mainframes, were used in the most productive areas, like high volume transactions of banking, accounting and airline reservations, over two decades before personal computers. Also, computers replaced a sophisticated system of data processing that used . Therefore, the important productivity opportunities were exhausted before computers were everywhere. We were looking at the wrong time period.\nAnother hypothesis states that computers are simply not very productivity enhancing because they require time, a scarce complementary human input. This theory holds that although computers perform a variety of tasks, these tasks are not done in any particularly new or efficient manner, but rather they are only done faster. Current data does not confirm the validity of either hypothesis. It could very well be that increases in productivity due to computers are not captured in GDP measures, but rather in quality changes and new products.\n\nEconomists have done research in the productivity issue and concluded that there are three possible explanations for the paradox. The explanations can be divided in three categories:\n\n\nOther economists have made a more controversial charge against the utility of computers: that they pale into insignificance as a source of productivity advantage when compared to the industrial revolution, electrification, infrastructures (canals and waterways, railroads, highway system), Fordist mass production and the replacement of human and animal power with machines. High productivity growth occurred from last decades of the 19th century until the 1973, with a peak from 1929 to 1973, then declined to levels of the early 19th century.\n\nA number of explanations of this have been advanced, including:\n\n\nGordon J. Bjork points out that manufacturing productivity gains continued, although at a decreasing rate than in decades past; however, the cost reductions in manufacturing shrank the sector size. The services and government sectors, where productivity growth is very low, gained in share, dragging down the overall productivity number. Because government services are priced at cost with no value added, government productivity growth is near zero as an artifact of the way in which it is measured. Bjork also points out that manufacturing uses more capital per unit of output than government or services.\n\nWhen computers for general business applications appeared in the 1950s, a sophisticated industry for data processing existed in the form of unit record equipment. These systems processed data on punched cards by running the cards through tabulating machines, the holes in the cards allowing electrical contact to activate relays and solenoids to keep a count. The flow of punched cards could be arranged in various sequences to allow sophisticated data processing. Some unit record equipment was directed by a wired control panel, with the panel being removable, allowing for quick replacement with another wired control panel.\n\nIn 1949 vacuum tube calculators were added to unit record equipment. In 1955 the first completely transistorized calculator with magnetic cores for dynamic memory, the IBM 608, was introduced.\n\nThe first computers were an improvement over unit record equipment, but not by a great amount. This was partly due to low level software used, low performance capability and failure of vacuum tubes and other components. Also, the data input to early computers used punched cards. Most of these hardware and software shortcomings were solved by the late 1960s, but punched cards did not become fully displaced until the 1980s.\n\nComputers did not revolutionize manufacturing because automation, in the form of control systems, had already been in existence for decades, although computers did allow more sophisticated control, which led to improved product quality and process optimization. Pre-computer control was known as \"analog\" control and computerized control is called \"digital\".\n\nCredit card transactions now represent a large percentage of low value transactions on which credit card companies charge merchants. Most of such credit card transactions are more of a habit than an actual need for credit and to the extent that such purchases represent convenience or lack of planning to carry cash on the part of consumers, these transactions add a layer of unnecessary expense. However, debit or check card transactions are cheaper than processing paper checks.\n\nDespite high expectations for online retail sales, individual item and small quantity handling and transportation costs may offset the savings of not having to maintain \"bricks and mortar\" stores. Online retail sales has proven successful in specialty items, collectibles and higher priced goods. Some airline and hotel retailers and aggregators have also witnessed great success.\n\nOnline commerce has been extremely successful in banking, airline, hotel, and rental car reservations, to name a few.\n\nThe personal computer restructured the office by reducing the secretarial and clerical staffs. Prior to computers, secretaries transcribed Dictaphone recordings or live speech into shorthand, and typed the information, typically a memo or letter. All filing was done with paper copies.\n\nA new position in the office staff was the information technologist, or department.\nWith networking came information overload in the form of e-mail, with some office workers receiving several hundred each day, most of which are not necessary information for the recipient.\n\nSome hold that one of the main productivity boosts from information technology is still to come: large-scale reductions in traditional offices as home offices become widespread, but this requires large and major changes in work culture and remains to be proven.\n\nIt is well known by software developers that projects typically run over budget and finish behind schedule.\n\nSoftware development is typically for new applications that are unique. The project's analyst is responsible for interviewing the stakeholders, individually and in group meetings, to gather the requirements and incorporate them into a logical format for review by the stakeholders and developers. This sequence is repeated in successive iterations, with partially completed screens available for review in the latter stages.\n\nUnfortunately, stakeholders often have a vague idea of what the functionality should be, and tend to add a lot of unnecessary features, resulting in schedule delays and cost overruns.\n\nBy the late 1990s there were some signs that productivity in the workplace been improved by the introduction of IT, especially in the United States. In fact, Erik Brynjolfsson and his colleagues found a significant positive relationship between IT investments and productivity, at least when these investments were made to complement organizational changes. A large share of the productivity gains outside the IT-equipment industry itself have been in retail, wholesale and finance. A major advance was computerized stock market transaction processing, which replaced the system that had been in place since the Civil War but by the last half of 1968 caused the U. S. stock market to close most Wednesday afternoons processing.\n\nAcemoglu, , Dorn, Hanson & Price (2014) have revisited the issue to find that \"there is...little evidence of faster productivity growth in IT-intensive industries after the late 1990s. Second and more importantly, to the extent that there is more rapid growth of labor productivity...this is associated with declining output...and even more rapidly declining employment.\" In fact, up to half of the growth of U.S. healthcare spending is attributable to technology costs. Additionally, computers and mobile phones are continually cited as the greatest reducers of workplace productivity by means of distraction..\n\n\n"}

For this reason, the aid agency's name was changed from DANAID to DANIDA at the last minute when this unfortunate connotation was discovered. The term Danida appeared in 1963.\n\nDenmark has been granting development assistance since the end of the Second World War. It is one of the five countries in the world that meets the United Nation's target of granting 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) in development assistance. In 2011 Denmark disbursed roughly DKK:15.753 billion (US$2.98 billion) in development assistance to countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Denmark's European Union neighbors. In 2009, DANIDA worked in close association with the Indian Government's Padmasree award winner, K.Viswanathan, and the prestigious institution Mitraniketan. Furthermore, DANIDA works in collaboration with many Danish NGOs such as Global Medical Aid.\n\nDANIDA focusses on four areas of interest:\n\nAs of 2015, DANIDA was involved in a total of 73 countries and regions across the world, with 21 countries of high priority. Most of the priority countries are among the poorest of the world, located in Africa and Asia.\n\nThe sectors receiving the largest amount of financial bilateral support is government and civil society, and humanitarian aid, at roughly 28% and 14% respectively.\n\nMost of the goals of DANIDA's projects gets fulfilled, with an annual success rate between 79% and 88% since 2005.\n\nDanish development assistance in the 1950s was nearly exclusively channeled through the United Nations. In 1962, Denmark established its first bilateral development assistance programme for developing countries under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2010, about 40% of Denmark’s bilateral assistance went to social sectors, including education and health. Danida also works in collaboration with the United Nations, the World Bank, regional development banks and the European Union.\n\n\n"}

It is located on the Narva River along the Russian border with Estonia, across from the Estonian city of Narva.\n\nIvangorod Fortress was established by Ivan III in 1492, intended to reaffirm Muscovy's right to access the Baltic Sea and to form a bulwark against the Teutonic Order, being built opposite the powerful Teutonic Hermann Castle. The fortress eventually grew into the town of Ivangorod, and the structures of the fort were gradually expanded and strengthened. Ivangorod Fortress was controlled by Sweden after the end of the Livonian War in 1583, changing hands numerous times during conflicts and border shifts over the following centuries until returning to permanent Russian rule after World War II via the Soviet Union. Today, Ivangorod Fortress is a museum and a tourist attraction.\n\nThe original castle was constructed in one summer, in the year 1492. It was named after Muscovite Grand Prince Ivan III. Its purpose was to fend off the Livonian Knights. The castle is strictly quadrilateral, measuring , with walls 14 metres tall. \n\nIvangorod was won back later in the year by Muscovite forces from the Livonians, under the command of Prince Ivan Gundar and Mikhail Klyapin. Three thousand troops arrived to retake the castle, rebuild it, and construct a new barracks and stronger bastions. For almost 10 years, the land around the castle was in constant warfare. The fortress and the land around changed hands repeatedly. The castle was reconstructed and fortified many times, becoming one of the strongest defensive structures in the 16th century. The castle was in development until the 17th century, becoming a large, sprawling fortress with several lines of defence.\n\nThe Treaty of Teusina (1595) returned the fortress to the Russians. In 1612, the Swedes conquered the fortress, which was bravely defended by a voivode, Fyodor Aminev (b 1560s, d 1628) and his sons. By the Treaty of Stolbova, Ingria was ceded to Gustav II Adolf, king of Sweden. In 1704, Peter the Great captured the castle from Swedish troops, bringing the fortress back into Russian control. Inside the fortress, there are two churches: one is dedicated to the Virgin's Assumption (1496) and the other to St Nicholas (built in the late 16th century but later reconstructed).\nAfter the early 18th century, the military role of the fortress dwindled due to technological advances. In 1728, a review was carried out of the fortresses in this area, which concluded that the installation had been neglected, and had a low fighting efficiency. An order was issued for restoration of the Ivangorod fortress, but after the inspection of 1738 the fortress was designated not adequate for defence purposes.\n\nIn 1840, some improvements were carried out in the fortress (roofs were renewed), and further improvements took place in 1863 and 1911-1914. During World War I, the fortress was captured by the Germans on 25 February 1918. From 1919 to 1940, the fortress belonged to Estonia. Despite changing hands several times in the first half of the 20th century, the fortress played no significant role in fighting.\n\nDuring World War II, it was first controlled by the Soviet Union (1940–1941) and then by Nazi Germany (1941–1944), which established two POW camps within the fortress and left many of its buildings damaged after their retreat. After the annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940, the Ivangorod fortress was part of the Russian Soviet Republic. The town and fortress remained with Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the restoration of the independent Republic of Estonia in 1990. Currently, the fortress serves as a museum.\n\nThe history and art museum of the Ivangorod fortress exhibits paintings of Ivan Bilibin, Alexandra Pototskaya and other artists. Also, local history and tradition are explained by some of the museum's exhibits, such as archeological finds encountered in the surrounding areas. There is a permanent exhibition devoted to the Northern War and the Livonian War. As well, there are models of fortresses in the surrounding region and armaments, and documents and letters related to famous people such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky, exhibited in the fortress museum.\n\n"}

Since 2007, it has been owned by Automattic, having integrated it into their WordPress.com blogging platform.\n\nOn Gravatar, users can register an account based on their email address, and upload a digital avatar to be associated with the account. Gravatar plugins are available for popular blogging software; when the user posts a comment on such a blog that requires an email address, the blogging software checks whether that email address has an associated avatar at Gravatar. If so, the Gravatar is shown along with the comment. Gravatar support is provided natively in WordPress as of v2.5 and in web based project management application Redmine beginning with version 0.8. Support for Gravatar is also provided via third-party modules for web content management systems such as Drupal and MODX.\n\nA Gravatar image can be up to 2048 pixels wide, is always square and is displayed at 80 by 80 pixels by default. If the uploaded avatar is larger or smaller, the avatar is scaled appropriately. Each Gravatar is rated with an MPAA-style age recommendation, allowing webmasters to control the content of the Gravatars displayed on their website.\n\nWebmasters can also configure their system to automatically display an Identicon when a user has no registered Gravatar.\n\nGravatars are loaded from the Gravatar web server, using a URL containing an MD5 hash of the associated email address. This method has, however, been shown to be vulnerable to dictionary attacks (in one real-life example over 10% of the email addresses of a set of forum users could be determined from the Gravatar URLs combined with the forum user names) and rainbow table approaches.\n\nA user's profile data is available in a number of metadata standards, including hCard, JSON, XML, PHP, and vCard as well as via QR codes. The raw data formats (JSON, XML, and PHP) use the Portable Contacts standard.\n\nFor some time, the Gravatar service remained unmaintained. The maker became busy with working on a new version of the service, as Gravatar's popularity grew and more bandwidth was required. On 16 February 2007, \"Gravatar 2.0\" was launched. Besides an improved server script, users also noticed other improvements, such as being able to crop and use an image already hosted on the web. Support for two gravatars per account was added, between which the user can easily switch. \"Gravatar Premium\" was also launched, allowing unlimited email addresses and Gravatars per account.\n\nOn 11 June 2007, Tom Preston-Werner announced that 32,000 new users had signed up since the launch of Gravatar 2.0.\n\nOn 18 October 2007, Automattic acquired Gravatar. After doing so, they offered all previously paid services at no cost, improved server response time, and refunded those who had recently paid for service.\n\nMatt Mullenweg announced on \"The Big Web Show\" on 2 December 2010 that Gravatar was serving approximately 20 billion images per day.\n"}
{"id": "2028096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028096", "title": "Relient K", "text": "Relient K\n\nRelient K is an American rock band formed in 1998 in Canton, Ohio, by Matt Thiessen, Matt Hoopes, and Brian Pittman during the band members' third year in high school and their time at Malone University. The band is named after guitarist Hoopes' automobile, a Plymouth Reliant K car, with the spelling intentionally altered to avoid trademark infringement over the \"Reliant\" name.\n\nThe group is associated with the contemporary Christian music culture, most notably the Christian rock and punk scene. The group has also performed alongside secular artists. The band has reached critical success with mainstream pop punk and alternative rock. The band's sound incorporates piano and acoustic elements. Since its formation, Relient K has released nine studio albums, seven EPs, two Christmas albums, and one collection of rarities. The band has received numerous awards including a Grammy Award nomination in 2004 for Best Rock Gospel Album and two Dove Awards.\n\nRelient K has found commercial success with their studio albums, three of which peaked in the top 15 of the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 chart: 2004's \"Mmhmm\", which debuted at No. 15; 2007's \"Five Score and Seven Years Ago\", their fifth and most successful album, which debuted at No. 6; and 2009's \"Forget and Not Slow Down\", which debuted at No. 15. The band has sold over 2 million records, with three albums being given gold certification by the RIAA. The band is also highly successful throughout the Christian albums and contemporary Christian music charts. On October 4, 2011 the band released a cover album \"Is for Karaoke\". On July 2, 2013, the band's seventh full-length album, \"Collapsible Lung\", was released. On July 22, 2016, the band's eighth full-length album, \"Air for Free\", was released. On April 24, 2020, they released \"Relient K: Live\" that includes 15 tracks that were only previously available on vinyl and were recorded at shows in 2009 and 2016. \n\nAfter Relient K was founded by Matt Thiessen, Matt Hoopes and Brian Pittman in 1998, Todd Frascone joined for a short time in 1998 as a drummer. However, Frascone left the band after recording the demo \"All Work & No Play\". The demo was recorded by Mark Lee Townsend, the former live guitar player for dc Talk. Townsend had met the band members because his daughter, Danielle, was friends with the band. Danielle eventually married guitarist Matt Hoopes.\n\n\"All Work & No Play\" caught the attention of dc Talk's Toby McKeehan (tobyMac), who later signed the band to his label, Gotee Records. With the label Relient K released its debut EP, \"2000 A.D.D.\" in 2000, with Stephen Cushman on drums. Soon after, the band released \"Relient K\", the group's first full-length CD. It was distinctly Christian rock and featured lyrics with a wide range of pop-culture references. Cushman left later that year to join the Christian metal band Narcissus. Brett Schoneman of Christian rock band Philmore filled in temporarily, followed by Jared Byers, drummer of the Christian rock band Bleach, until Dave Douglas joined in December 2000.\n\nIn an interview, Matt Thiessen said that when the band started, he was the only one who sang, but he knew Matt Hoopes could sing as well. Hoopes was reluctant, but Thiessen said he \"got it out of him\". As a result, Hoopes became the primary back-up vocalist.\n\nThe band released its second album, \"The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek\", in 2001. Though there were still plenty of pop-culture references on this album, it contained many more softer songs and slightly lighter guitars. The band would continue chords through tracks in order to fluidly transition in between songs, a trend that continued on the group's later albums.\n\n\"Anatomy\" landed them in the Christian rock limelight, and Relient K was offered a clothing deal with Abercrombie & Fitch in 2001. Gotee, the band's label, accepted the offer on Relient K's behalf; Pittman recalls, \"The choice was never really given to us. The label made the choice.\" After significant pressure from conservative Christian organizations such as Focus on the Family, Gotee backed out of the contract.\n\nRelient K was then asked to do a rendition of the popular \"VeggieTales\" song \"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything\" for the 2002 feature length \"VeggieTales\" movie \"\". The song was released on three different albums, two in single form. The first version also included Relient K's \"Breakdown\" being sung by Larry the Cucumber. There was also a promotional version which included the original version of \"Breakdown\". A cut-down version (missing the bridge) was included on the Christian rock compilation \"Veggie Rocks!\". This song mixes the sounds of \"The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek\", and the band's third album, \"Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do\".\n\nIn 2003, Relient K released \"Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do\". The album had multiple covers of different colors, each depicting a vehicle in some kind of wreck. As pop-culture references became less specific, sound and vocals became far more defined. \"Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do\" (often called \"Two Lefts\" by fans) combined the soft, meaningful songs of \"The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek\" and threw in fast-paced songs with deep lyrics. It was nominated for a Grammy in the category of \"Best Rock Gospel Album\" and won the Dove Award for \"Modern Rock Album of the Year\" in 2004.\n\nDuring this time, Relient K also released a limited edition red vinyl EP entitled \"The Vinyl Countdown\", only released in one printing. The EP included two versions of the song, \"Five Iron Frenzy is Either Dead or Dying.\" The album was dedicated to Jesse Alkire, contest winner and friend of Matthew Thiessen, who inspired the song \"The Vinyl Countdown.\"\n\nSince \"Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do\" was released in March 2003, Relient K released a bonus disc for Christmas, entitled \"Deck the Halls, Bruise Your Hand\". The album was packaged with \"Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do\" from November 2003 to December 2003.\n\nThe group released its fourth album, \"Mmhmm\", in late 2004. Pop-culture references were even less specific than on the band's third album, if present at all. The album was significantly more on the serious side with very few of the silly songs the band was known for. The album had the band experimenting with its sound a bit more, which included incorporating piano, hardcore punk and some pop music. In July 2005, the album was certified gold for shipping over 500,000 copies. It is reported that it has sold approximately 796,000 copies. Driven by newfound recognition from \"Mmhmm\", \"Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do\" was also certified gold in spring 2005. Also, it was announced in 2006 that the band's second record, \"The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek\", had reached the Gold rank as well as certified by the RIAA.\n\nShortly before \"Mmhmm\"s release, longtime bassist Brian Pittman left the band, citing that he was tired of touring and wanted to start a landscaping company. He also joined Christian metal band Inhale Exhale shortly afterward. Matt Thiessen announced Pittman's departure in fall 2004, saying:\n\"After almost seven years of being in Relient K, our cherished and lifelong friend, Brian Pittman has decided to move on to other things. That IS crazy, huh? Brian decided to leave the band in July, so we've had plenty of time to let the initial shock die down. We're aware that a lot of you already knew, so we apologize for not announcing this sooner. There were many reasons. He thought long and hard about his decision, and he came to the conclusion that he would like to do other things than play bass for the band. We respect him for it. We'd be lying to say that we're not all completely bummed that Brian won't be a part of Relient K anymore. And though we know things won't be the same without him, it must be said that we have always valued our friendships with him more than our on-stage relationship.\n\"Anyway, all of us still hang out, and its like nothing is different at all. I feel like that's how you know that you've made a friend that will be there for the rest of your days. We want to thank Brian for all the years he gave the band. You're the best, buddy.\"\n\nPittman reunited with the band for one final show, which was the release party for \"Mmhmm\" at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, Ohio on November 1, 2004. John Warne, lead singer and guitarist of Ace Troubleshooter, filled in as bassist for the remainder of 2004 and became full-time bassist in 2005. Also in 2005, Jon Schneck joined as a third guitarist, as well as a banjo and bell player, to create a fuller, more distinctive sound. This was also because the band planned to add more piano, and having another guitarist gave Matt Thiessen the freedom to do that.\nRelient K provided the first track, \"Manic Monday\" originally recorded by The Bangles, to the various artist CD, \"Punk Goes 80's\", released on June 7, 2005.\n\n\"Mmhmm\" features two Top 40 hits which both made it on MTV's Top Ten. The music video for the track Be My Escape entered MTV's Top Ten, and landed them an appearance on \"The Tonight Show\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\". \"Be My Escape\" is also featured on \"Now! 19\", a popular secular and quasi-annual compilation series. It was classified as a gold single in October 2005. The music video for \"Who I Am Hates Who I've Been\" has also made its way onto the \"Total Request Live\" countdown, many top 40 radio stations, and was included on \"Now! 21\". \"Mmhmm\" was awarded a Dove Award in 2006 for the \"Rock Album of the Year.\" The band was also nominated for \"Artist of the Year\" and \"Band of the Year\" at GMA Canada's 2006 Covenant Awards.\n\nRecording sessions for another studio album, \"Five Score and Seven Years Ago\", started on June 18, 2006 and continued for parts of July and August. Some tracks on the album were produced by Howard Benson, (The All-American Rejects, My Chemical Romance, P.O.D.). \"Four score and seven years ago\" is the first line of the Gettysburg Address, the famous speech delivered by Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. Thiessen had said that the title of the album comes from the fact that it's the band's fifth album, it is the first time all five of them are on a record together, and the band had been seven years since the release of \"Relient K\".\n\nWhile the band hoped for a November 2006 release, the official release date was announced as March 6, 2007. The album is considered, by the band, to be the group's happiest record to date. On March 2, 2007 the entire album (except the last track, \"Deathbed\") was made available for streaming on the band's MySpace. \"Five Score and Seven Years Ago\" debuted at No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling about 64,000 copies in its first week.\n\nThe band's first single from the album, \"Must Have Done Something Right,\" was released on the iTunes Store on November 28, 2006 and to radio on January 9, 2007. \"Forgiven\" was the first radio single directed at Christian stations. \"Forgiven\" was the most added song on Christian radio and entered \"Billboard\"'s Hot Christian Songs chart on January 11, 2007. The single received enough airplay to be the fourth most played song on Christian Hit Radio (CHR) stations in 2007 according to \"R&R\" magazine.\nThe second single from the album, \"The Best Thing,\" was released to radio on April 10, 2007, taking the 7th most adds in its first week. Thiessen has said that \"The Best Thing\" is \"the anti-Daniel Powter \"Bad Day\" song. It's straight-up positive.\" A video was filmed for the single. The second single released on Christian CHR radio stations was \"Give Until There's Nothing Left\", which was the 20th most played song on CHR radio stations in 2007.\n\nIn the early morning of June 28, 2007, Relient K's bus caught on fire from an oil spill from the engine. Everyone escaped safely, but the band lost many instruments, laptops, cameras, phones, iPods, clothes, and merchandise. Matt Thiessen said he lost a laptop that had roughly 100 unfinished songs on it, and Dave Douglas lost his Battlefield drum set. In the midst of it, the band still laughed at the situation, calling it \"cinematic\". On a blog post on the band's website, Matt Thiessen stated that the next day after the fire, the band members went to view the damage of their van and found that while 85% of their gear was intact, Douglas's drum kit set was not salvageable. A member of the Switchfoot forums first announced it, asking everyone to pray for the band. The band had just played Creation Northeast, and had to cancel its scheduled appearance at Cornerstone Festival in Illinois. The group did, however, play its next scheduled show in Greeley, CO on June 30, 2007. In the months following, the band played more Christian rock festivals.\n\nThe band released \"Let It Snow, Baby... Let It Reindeer\", a Christmas album, on October 23, 2007. The CD contained all of the tracks from \"Deck the Halls, Bruise Your Hand\" as well as six new songs. This Christmas themed re-release was met with a peak of No. 96 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nRelient K, Switchfoot and Ruth recorded a song together, \"Rebuild\". It is available for download on Switchfoot's website; fans can choose between paying for the song (with proceeds going to Habitat for Humanity) or downloading it for free.\nOn October 18, 2007 drummer Dave Douglas announced his departure on good terms on the band's website due to a desire to pursue his side-project Gypsy Parade with his wife Rachel. He played his last show with Relient K on December 29, 2007. On February 12, 2008 it was announced that Ethan Luck, former guitarist of The O.C. Supertones and for Demon Hunter, would be replacing Douglas as the band's new drummer.\n\nLuck and Warne were in a short-lived band together called Guerilla Rodeo.\n\n\"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything\" which was originally recorded for \"Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie\", was also used in \"\".\n\nOn July 1, 2008 Relient K released a double EP. The double EP is contained on a single disc and contains \"The Nashville Tennis EP\" and \"The Bird and the Bee Sides\". \"The Nashville Tennis EP\" included 13 tracks of new material that allowed the band to explore its sound a bit by allowing other band members, besides Thiessen and Hoopes, to compose/record a few tracks, as well as adding some influences from country and ska music. \"The Bird and the Bee Sides\" contained tracks that had previously been released on hard-to-come-by records. \"The Bird and the Bee Sides\" won the 2009 GMA Canada Covenant Award for Modern Rock/Alternative Album of the Year. In turning in the EP, Relient K officially fulfilled its contract with Gotee Records and subsequently signed to and now manage Mono vs Stereo (an imprint of Gotee Records).\nIn November 2008, the band released three bonus iTunes tracks for a re-issue of \"Let It Snow, Baby... Let It Reindeer\". The tracks were later pulled from iTunes, but have since then been released on Gotee Records's 2010 Christmas compilation album: \"'Tis The Season To Be Gotee\".\n\nIn early 2009, the band began to write music for an album to be released later in 2009. Thiessen stated that the band had been keen on finishing the album for a 2009 release and had begun recording the new album with the band's \"favorite\" producer, Mark Lee Townsend at Dark Horse Recording Studio in Tennessee. After recording a few tracks, the band stated that more tracks were set to be recorded with John Feldmann. Webisodes released weekly via the band's MySpace and Facebook pages show the recording progress in the studio. On May 8, 2009, Thiessen announced on Twitter the album's title, \"Forget and Not Slow Down\", also noting that 'Forget and Not Slow Down' is the name of a track.\n\"Forget and Not Slow Down\" was available for pre-order, with the option of having a faux VIP-Pass signed by members of the band, and T-shirt, and a poster featuring the names of all who pre-ordered the album. On September 29, the album was made available for stream off of AbsolutePunk. It was released on October 6, 2009.\n\nA bonus song was offered to customers who bought the album from Amazon.com's MP3 store. The song is entitled \"Terminals\" and was produced by \"Owl City's\" Adam Young. The song is now available for download without purchasing the full album.\n\nIn May 2010, Relient K released a triple-compilation collection CD entitled \"The First Three Gears\". It included the band's first three studio albums with various \"EP exclusive\" tracks attached to each CD, according to their approximate release year.\n\nIn October 2010, the band contributed an original song—\"What Can I Do\"—for Family Christian Stores' exclusive compilation album \"Freedom: Artists United for International Justice Mission\", created in order to generate funds for International Justice Mission in fighting modern-day slavery.\n\nOn April 11, 2011, the band announced via Facebook that a cover album was set to be recorded. On June 14, 2011, Alt Press reported the EP would be called \"K Is for Karaoke\" and displayed the album artwork. The band revealed one album song per day on its Facebook page. The first album, \"Is for Karaoke EP\", was made available for download on June 28, 2011 through the Amazon MP3 store. It was also available through iTunes or as a physical CD on the Vans Warped Tour and Rock The Universe at Universal Studios. On October 4, 2011 the group released a second EP, \"Is for Karaoke EP, Part 2\", and also the full-length album, \"Is for Karaoke\", which features all the tracks from both EPs.\n\nIn several interviews on YouTube, both Matt Thiessen and other band members stated that they had planned to enter the studio in November 2011 to write and record an album, which they hoped would be released mid-2012. However, due to a record label swap, the album was delayed. RCA Music Group announced it was dissolving Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, Relient K and all other artists previously signed to these three labels would release their future material on the RCA Records. In May 2012, it was announced via the band's Twitter that recording had begun with producer Paul Moak. On February 22, 2013, Absolutepunk.net posted that the new album was finished and that details were coming soon.\n\nOn February 4, 2013, the band released a single via YouTube, in the form of a lyric video: \"That's My Jam\". According to the group, the song was used in the background of a Pizza Hut commercial. Later, the track was redone, featuring Owl City, as an iTunes bonus track for \"Collapsible Lung\".\n\nOn March 30, the band announced at Easterfest that the new album would be called \"Collapsible Lung\". The song \"Don't Blink\" was released in the form of a lyric video on the band's YouTube channel. On April 19, the band announced that the release of \"Collapsible Lung\" had been postponed to July 2013, and the specific date of July 2 was confirmed, along with the album cover artwork, on May 17.\n\nOn April 21, drummer Ethan Luck stated that he is no longer a member of the band. He became the on-tour guitar technician for the Cold War Kids. He and the Jo(h)ns had earlier posted that they would not be appearing on the next tour.\n\nOn May 29, the band released a second lyric video for the album via YouTube titled \"Lost Boy\". This was then followed on June 29, by a third lyric video for the title song \"Collapsible Lung\".\n\nOn July 2, 2013, \"Collapsible Lung\" was released as expected. The album charted well on many of Billboard's charts, most notably topping at number No. 16 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nIn June 2014, the band contributed two cover songs to Gotee Records' twentieth anniversary album, \"Gotee Records: Twenty Years Brand New\". The band performed a cover of \"Body Be\" by Johnny Q. Public, as well as a tenth anniversary version of the band's \"Sadie Hawkins Dance\".\n\nIn July 2014, the band announced a 10th anniversary \"Mmhmm\" tour slated from October 30 in Louisville to December 12 in Nashville. Shortly after the tour announcement, drummer Dave Douglas announced his return to the band for the 10th anniversary tour. Neither Jon Schneck nor John Warne joined the band on this tour.\n\nOn September 30, 2015, long-time Relient K producer Mark Lee Townsend posted a short video on his Twitter account with the caption \"RK 8 has been serious fun to make... you're gonna dig it. #rkjamsessions.\" The video showed Matt Thiessen, Matt Hoopes, and three other people in a studio recording a new song.\n\nThiessen stated in an interview in November 2015, \"[Relient K has] a new record finished and poised for a 2016 release. At a show in December, the band revealed the album's title to be \"Air for Free\".\nOn February 14, 2016, Relient K digitally released a new single titled \"Look on Up\". The song, however, was said by Matt Hoopes to not make it onto the new record. Although there were rumors that the album would be released in May, the band announced that the album would release on July 22, 2016. The album has 16 tracks, and is available digitally and on CD and vinyl.\n\nA second single, \"Bummin'\", was released on April 13, 2016\n\nOn July 22, 2016 \"Air For Free\" was released. It debuted at No. 44 on the \"Billboard\" 200, No. 1 on Top Christian Albums, No. 6 on Top Rock Albums, and No. 3 on Top Alternative albums, selling 9,000 copies in its first week.\n\nOn October 27, 2016, Relient K digitally released \"The Creepier EP...er\", a Halloween-themed EP.\n\nRelient K toured alongside Switchfoot on the Looking For America tour from September 17, 2016 to November 26, 2016. Relient K announced that they would embark on a second tour with Switchfoot, the Still Looking For America 2our, which would cover Western U.S. and Canada, on January 21, 2017.\n\nOn February 12, 2017, Relient K digitally released a Valentine's Day EP titled \"Truly, Madly, Deeply EP\".\n\nOn April 24, 2020, they released \"Relient K: Live\", which combined live tracks from a 2009 show at Rocketown in Nashville, Tennessee and a 2016 show at The Ritz in Raleigh, North Carolina. The songs were previously only available on vinyl.\n\nCurrent members\n\n\nTouring musicians\n\n\nFormer members\n\n\nFormer touring musicians\n\n\nTimeline\n\nIn 2004, Relient K released a book, \"The Complex Infrastructure Known as the Female Mind\". Though the band is listed as the author of the book, the band members contributed very little to the content of the book. The book clues in the confused male Relient K fans on the thoughts of female fans, and clues in the confused female Relient K fans on some of the thoughts of males. The band gives advice on the opposite sex through personal experience, stereotypes (including The Rock Chick and Vanilla Pudding), and Biblical advice—presented in the attitude found in the group's music. The title of the book is taken from the last line of the song \"Mood Rings,\" which is found on the band's third album, \"Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do\".\n\nIn June 2006, Relient K released the first episode of the group's own flash cartoon. The cartoon features all five band members, and takes place in a fictional land known as Woodland Forest. It is animated by bassist John Warne. There have only been two episodes thus far, and can be found on YouTube. The cartoons also feature \"Merle the Squirrel,\" singing the Woodland Forest theme song, as well as \"Crosby the Reindeer,\" singing O Holy Night.\n\nRelient K has made a total of nine audio podcasts and eleven video podcasts. The nine audio podcasts were made during the band's time on the Matt Hoopes Birthday Tour. The band included interviews with the band members, the group's guitar technicians, and along with others involved in the group's touring. There were also interviews with the other touring bands, The Rocket Summer and Maxeen.\n\nThe five video podcasts include various scenes in the studio, as well as the band doing things outside the studio, much like the video podcasts made by Switchfoot. The first two video podcasts showed the band in the studio preparing for the recording of \"Five Score and Seven Years Ago\", and Dave Douglas recording the drum parts, respectively. The third video podcast was a collection of footage and discussions from the Nintendo Fusion Tour, and a \"Mario Kart DS\" Tournament between the five band members. The fourth video podcast showed Jon Schneck and Dave Douglas preparing for a boxing match (which is also included and completed in the Wal-Mart \"Devastation and Reform\" video), and the fifth video podcast showed the completion of the battle. There is a sixth unreleased video podcast including John Warne fulfilling his lifelong dream of walking into a room with the AutoZone Theme Song playing. It shows Warne recording the song with the assistance of Dave Douglas and Jon Schneck. It can be found on YouTube at the present time, and it is currently unofficially released on the site, as it has not made it to the band's official site. The eighth video podcast is about the band going to see millions of bats fly at sundown. The last podcast is a short video showing the band playing a game called \"Gum Golf\" created during the release of \"Let it Snow, Baby... Let it Reindeer\".\n\nOutside of Relient K, Matt Thiessen has a piano-focused solo project called Matthew Thiessen and the Earthquakes. He started it in 1998, around the time Relient K was started. He has released seven songs either online or on various CD releases. \n\nThe band made a cover of the song, \"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything\" for the soundtrack to the movie . It was also featured in the of the song.\n\nFormer drummer Dave Douglas created a project called Agnes, a solo rock project that somewhat resembles the sound of Relient K's earlier music with his own twist. Douglas also started a project called Gypsy Parade, a softer project that he started with his wife, Rachel. They have released two demo songs on their MySpace with more expected. Douglas amicably left Relient K to further pursue this project. Gypsy Parade has since disbanded, Attack Cat taking its place.\n\nEthan Luck, the former drummer, was involved with the Christian metal band Demon Hunter until late 2009, but he also has a side project called My Red Hot Nightmare which included drummer Josh Abbott, who was the drummer for Bassist John Warne's band, Ace Troubleshooter for the band's entire existence. Luck also played guitar in the Christian Ska band The O.C. Supertones and is featured on a few of the band's albums, including Loud and Clear and Live! Volume One.\n\nThree tracks were featured on the compilation album \"My Other Band, Vol. 1\" on Mono vs Stereo records in 2006, from Matt Thiessen's side project Matthew Thiessen and the Earthquakes, Dave Douglas' side project Agnes, and Ethan Luck's My Red Hot Nightmare project. Relient K was part of a fundraiser called \"Habitat for Humanity\" with other Christian bands. Matt Thiessen and Jon Foreman (Switchfoot's lead singer and guitarist) wrote a song called \"Rebuild\" to help raise even more money.\n\nIn 2011, John Warne became a member of Yellow Second.\n\nMatt Thiessen co-wrote the song \"Longshot\" along with Katy Perry for Kelly Clarkson's CD, \"All I Ever Wanted\".\n\nRelient K starred in the educational drug prevention film, \"Natural High 4\". The band members provided advice to young adults to stay off of drugs and to pursue their personal best.\n\n"}

{"id": "2028143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028143", "title": "Computer-supported collaboration", "text": "Computer-supported collaboration\n\nComputer-supported collaboration (CSC) research focuses on technology that affects groups, organizations, communities and societies, e.g., voice mail and text chat. It grew from cooperative work study of supporting people's work activities and working relationships. As net technology increasingly supported a wide range of recreational and social activities, consumer markets expanded the user base, enabling more and more people to connect online to create what researchers have called a computer supported cooperative work, which includes \"all contexts in which technology is used to mediate human activities such as communication, coordination, cooperation, competition, entertainment, games, art, and music\" (from CSCW 2004).\n\nThe subfield computer-mediated communication deals specifically with how humans use \"computers\" (or digital media) to form, support and maintain relationships with others (social uses), regulate information flow (instructional uses), and make decisions (including major financial and political ones). It does not focus on common work products or other \"collaboration\" but rather on \"meeting\" itself, and on trust. By contrast, CSC is focused on the output from, rather than the character or emotional consequences of, meetings or relationships, reflecting the difference between \"communication\" and \"collaboration\".\n\nUnlike communication research, which focuses on trust, or computer science, which focuses on truth and logic, CSC focuses on cooperation and collaboration and decision making theory, which are more concerned with rendezvous and contract. For instance, auctions and market systems, which rely on bid and ask relationships, are studied as part of CSC but not usually as part of communication.\n\nThe term CSC emerged in the 1990s to replace the following terms:\n\nTwo different types of software are sometimes differentiated:\n\nBase technologies such as netnews, email, chat and wikis could be described as \"social\", \"collaborative\" or both or neither. Those who say \"social\" seem to focus on so\"-called \"virtual community\" while those who say \"collaborative\" seem to be more concerned with content management and the actual output. While software may be designed to achieve cl\"oser social ties or specific deliverables, it is hard to support collaboration without also enabling relationships to form, and hard to support a social interaction without some kind of shared co-authored works. \n\nAccordingly, the differentiation between social and collaborative software may also be stated as that between \"play\" and \"work\". Some theorists hold that a play ethic should apply, and that work must become more game-like or play-like in order to make using computers a more comfortable experience. The study of MUDs and MMRPGs in the 1980s and 1990s led many to this conclusion, which is now not controversial. \n\nTrue multi-player computer games can be considered a simple form of collaboration, but only a few theorists include this as part of CSC.\n\nThe relatively new areas of evolutionary computing, massively parallel algorithms, and even \"artificial life\" explore the solution of problems by the evolving interaction of large numbers of small actors, or agents, or decision-makers who interact in a largely unconstrained fashion. The \"side effect\" of the interaction may be a solution of interest, such as a new sorting algorithm; or there may be a permanent residual of the interaction, such as the setting of weights in a neural network that has now been \"tuned\" or \"trained\" to repeatedly solve a specific problem, such as making a decision about granting credit to a person, or distinguishing a diseased plant from a healthy one. Connectionism is a study of systems in which the learning is stored in the linkages, or connections, not in what is normally thought of as content.\n\nThis larger definition of \"computing\", in which not just the data, or the metadata, or the context of the data, but the computer itself is being \"processed\", makes the term \"social computing\" have a whole different meaning.\n\nCommunication essential to the collaboration, or disruptive of it, is studied in CSC proper. It is somehow hard to find or draw a line between a well-defined process and general human communications.\n\nReflecting desired organization protocols and business processes and governance norms directly, so that regulated communication (the collaboration) can be told apart from free-form interactions, is important to collaboration research, if only to know where to stop the study of work and start the study of people. \"The subfield CMC or computer-mediated communication deals with human relationships.\"\n\nTasks undertaken in this field resemble those of any social science, but with a special focus on systems integration and groups:\n\nLess ambitiously, specific CSC fields are often studied under their own names with no reference to the more general field of study, focusing instead on the technology with only minimal attention to the collaboration implied, e.g. video games, videoconferences. Since some specialized devices exist for games or conferences that do not include all of the usual boot image capabilities of a true \"computer\", studying these separately may be justified. There is also separate study of e-learning, e-government, e-democracy and telemedicine. The subfield telework also often stands alone.\n\nThe development of this field reaches back to the late 1960s and the visionary assertions of Ted Nelson, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Glenn Gould, Nicholas Negroponte and others who saw a potential for digital media to ultimately redefine how we work. A very early thinker, Vannevar Bush, even suggested in 1945 \"As We May Think.\"\n\nThe inventor of the computer \"mouse\", Douglas Engelbart, studied collaborative software (especially revision control in computer-aided software engineering and the way a graphic user interface could enable interpersonal communication) in the 1960s. Alan Kay worked on Smalltalk, which embodied these principles, in the 1970s, and by the 1980s it was well regarded and considered to represent the future of user interfaces.\n\nHowever, at this time, collaboration capabilities were limited. As few computers had even local area networks, and processors were slow and expensive, the idea of using them simply to accelerate and \"augment\" human communication was eccentric in many situations. Computers processed numbers, not text, and the collaboration was in general devoted only to better and more accurate handling of numbers.\n\nThis began to change in the 1980s with the rise of personal computers, modems and more general use of the Internet for non-academic purposes. People were clearly collaborating online with all sorts of motives, but using a small suite of tools (LISTSERV, netnews, IRC, MUD) to support all of those motives. Research at this time focused on textual communication, as there was little or no exchange of audio and video representations. Some researchers, such as Brenda Laurel, emphasized how similar online dialogue was to a play, and applied Aristotle's model of drama to their analysis of computers for collaboration.\n\nAnother major focus was hypertext—in its pre-HTML, pre-WWW form, focused more on links and semantic web applications than on graphics. Such systems as Superbook, NoteCards, KMS and the much simpler HyperTies and HyperCard were early examples of collaborative software used for e-learning.\n\nIn the 1990s, the rise of broadband networks and the dotcom boom presented the internet as mass media to a whole generation. By the late 1990s, VoIP and net phones and chat had emerged. For the first time, people used computers \"primarily\" as communications, not \"computing\" devices. This, however, had long been anticipated, predicted, and studied by experts in the field.\n\nVideo collaboration is not usually studied. Online videoconferencing and webcams have been studied in small scale use for decades but since people simply do not have built-in facilities to create video together directly, they are properly a communication, not collaboration, concern.\n\nOther pioneers in the field included Ted Nelson, Austin Henderson, Kjeld Schmidt, Lucy Suchman, Sara Bly, Randy Farmer, and many \"economists, social psychologists, anthropologists, organizational theorists, educators, and anyone else who can shed light on group activity.\" - Grudin.\n\nIn this century, the focus has shifted to sociology, political science, management science and other business disciplines. This reflects the use of the net in politics and business and even other high-stakes collaboration situations, such as war.\n\nThough it is not studied at the ACM conferences, military use of collaborative software has been a very major impetus of work on maps and data fusion, used in military intelligence. A number of conferences and journals are concerned primarily with the military use of digital media and the security implications thereof.\n\nCurrent research in computer-supported collaboration includes:\n\nEarly researchers, such as Bill Buxton, had focused on non-voice gestures (like humming or whistling) as a way to communicate with the machine while not interfering too directly with speech directed at a person. Some researchers believed voice as command interfaces were bad for this reason, because they encouraged speaking as if to a \"slave\".\n\nHTML supports simple link types with the REL tag and REV tag. Some standards for using these on the WWW were proposed, most notably in 1994, by people very familiar with earlier work in SGML. However, no such scheme has ever been adopted by a large number of web users, and the \"semantic web\" remains unrealized. Attempts such as crit.org have sometimes collapsed totally.\n\nWho am I, online? Can an account be assumed to be the same as a person's real-life identity? Should I have rights to continue any relationship I start through a service, even if I'm not using it any longer? Who owns information about the user? What about others (not the user) who are affected by information revealed or learned by me?\n\nOnline identity and privacy concerns, especially identity theft, have grown to dominate the CSCW agenda in more recent years. The separate Computers, Freedom and Privacy conferences deal with larger social questions, but basic concerns that apply to systems and work process design tend still to be discussed as part of CSC research.\n\nWhere decisions are made based exclusively or mostly on information received or exchanged online, how do people rendezvous to signal their trust in it, and willingness to make major decisions on it?\n\nTeam consensus decision making in software engineering, and the role of revision control, revert, reputation and other functions, has always been a major focus of CSC: There is no software without someone writing it. Presumably, those who do write it must understand something about collaboration in their own team. This design and code, however, is only one form of collaborative content.\n\nWhat are the most efficient and effective ways to share information? Can creative networks form through online meeting/work systems? Can people have equal power relationships in building content?\n\nBy the late 1990s, with the rise of wikis (a simple repository and data dictionary that was easy for the public to use), the way consensus applied to joint editing, meeting agendas and so on had become a major concern. Different wikis adopted different social and pseudopolitical structures to combat the problems caused by conflicting points of view and differing opinions on content.\n\nHow can work be made simpler, less prone to error, easier to learn? What role do diagrams and notations play in improving work output? What words do workers come to work already understanding, what do they misunderstand, and how can we get them using the same words to mean the same thing?\n\nStudy of content management, enterprise taxonomy and the other core instructional capital of the learning organization has become increasingly important due to ISO standards and the use of continuous improvement methods.\nNatural language and application commands tend to converge over time, becoming reflexive user interfaces.\n\nWhere are the workers? Do we care? How do we coordinate them? How do we hire them, fire them, help them find the right thing to do next?\n\nThe role of social network analysis and outsourcing services like e-lance, especially when combined in services like LinkedIn, is of particular concern in human capital management—again, especially in the software industry, where it is becoming more and more normal to run 24x7 globally distributed shops.\n\nRelated fields are collaborative product development, CAD/CAM, computer-aided software engineering (CASE), concurrent engineering, workflow management, distance learning, telemedicine, medical CSCW and the real-time network conferences called MUDs (after \"multi-user dungeons,\" although they are now used for more than game-playing).\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Bell Media. The station airs a Top 40/CHR format (as it reports to BDS and Mediabase as a Canadian Top 40 Airplay panel Canadian CHR reporter) and is the flagship of Canada's Virgin Radio stations. CKFM's studios are located at 250 Richmond Street West in the Entertainment District, while its transmitter is located at the top of the CN Tower.\n\nThe station was launched in 1938 by the Rogers Radio Broadcasting Co. Ltd. (operated by the father of the founder of Rogers Communications, Ted Rogers Sr.) as experimental FM station VE9AK. The station went off the air between 1942 and 1945 due to the war. It began broadcasting at 99.9 FM in 1947 as CFRB-FM, a simulcast of CFRB. Rogers Radio Broadcasting eventually became known as Standard Broadcasting which was acquired by Argus Corporation in 1948.\n\nIn April 1961, the complete simulcast was dropped, in favour of some unique programming.\n\nIn April 1963, the station changed its call letters to CKFM-FM. All CFRB programming was discontinued. The station adopted an easy listening and MOR format, which lasted for many years and was very successful in ratings (a 1974 \"Billboard magazine\" article claimed the station had the most listeners in the 25-to-34-year-old age group of any Canadian radio station, AM or FM). During this time period, CKFM carried a few specialty shows, such as a Sunday evening reggae music program. Towards the latter part of the 1980s, CKFM transitioned towards a more younger-targeting adult contemporary format.\n\nThe station adopted the brand name \"Mix 99.9\", on September 2, 1991, and adopted a hot adult contemporary format to compete with CHUM-FM. The first song on \"Mix\" was \"Changes\" by David Bowie. The brand name was changed slightly to \"99.9 Mix FM\" on August 8, 2006, and the branding was phased in throughout the day. This coincided with the return of former Kiss 92 and CHFI-FM morning show hosts Mad Dog and Billie to Toronto radio.\n\nA Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision from May 31, 2007, stated that the station's call sign was changed to CFMX-FM. Within weeks, the station reverted to CKFM-FM, due to both potential confusion with CFMZ-FM as that station, licensed to Cobourg but also heard in Toronto because of a rebroadcaster, was previously known as CFMX-FM; and because as of November 14, 2007, according to Industry Canada databases, the Toronto rebroadcaster of CFMZ-FM was actually still known as CFMX-FM-1 (not CFMZ-FM-1).\n\nOn October 28, 2007, CKFM was purchased by Astral Media as part of its purchase of Standard Broadcasting. Since its purchase by Astral, the hot AC format has gone more in a rhythmic-leaning direction, patterned after sister stations Mix 96 in Montreal and Crave 95 in Vancouver, which both carry rhythmic-leaning hot AC formats. It also began airing the \"American Top 40\", which usually airs on CHR stations across the United States and Canada.\n\nAstral announced a partnership with the Virgin Group to rebrand the station \"999 Virgin Radio\" on August 25, 2008, taking effect at 4 p.m. that day. The final song on \"Mix\" was Green Day's \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\", while the first song on \"Virgin\" was Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\". The change came just before the original UK Virgin Radio station was slated to lose its licence to the Virgin name and rebrand as Absolute Radio.\n\nAstral officials indicated at the time that, if the rebranding was successful, the Virgin Radio brand would eventually be rolled out to other markets nationwide. Barely three months later, on December 4, Astral deemed the new brand a success, and announced that stations in Montreal, Ottawa, and Vancouver will be rebranded as Virgin Radio stations effective early January 2009. All three stations will retain essentially the same formats (rock at the Ottawa station, hot AC in Montreal and Vancouver). In addition to the aforementioned three stations, the \"Virgin\" branding has since been expanded to Calgary, Edmonton, London, Winnipeg, Kitchener, Halifax, Victoria and Kelowna.\n\nAs of September 2009, the station was moved to the Canadian CHR panel on Mediabase and BDS, making the station the first in the CHR format with a transmitter atop the CN Tower and the second Top 40 station licensed to the City of Toronto, the other being CKIS-FM. At the time of the format altering, CKFM adopted the slogan \"Toronto's New #1 Hit Music Station\". Currently, CKFM competes with CKIS-FM, CIDC-FM, CKBT-FM in Kitchener, and, to a lesser extent, WKSE in Buffalo.\n\nIn June 2010, CKFM slightly changed its branding from \"9-9-9 Virgin Radio\" (pronounced, \"nine-nine-nine Virgin Radio\"), to \"99-9 Virgin Radio\" (pronounced, \"ninety-nine-nine Virgin Radio\"). A week after the change, the station held a contest called \"Say it & Win!\", where the 99th caller gets 10 seconds to say their new branding, \"ninety-nine-nine Virgin Radio\" for as many times as they can. For each time the contestant read out their new logo, $100 would be given to him/her.\n\nOn June 27, 2013, Bell Media completed its acquisition of Astral Media, making CKFM a sister station to Hot AC-formatted CHUM-FM and sports talk-formatted CHUM (AM). Due to CRTC ownership limits, Bell and Astral's fellow FM stations CFXJ-FM and CHBM-FM were sold to Newcap Radio.\n\nOn July 4, 2017, CKFM-FM launched HD Radio multi-casting services. The HD1 sub-channel carries the same programming as the standard analog frequency. As of mid-2018, the HD2 sub-channel carries a simulcast of sister station NewsTalk 1010, the HD3 sub-channel carries a simulcast of TSN Radio 1050, and the HD4 channel carries a country music format branded as Pure Country.\n\nAfter Virgin Radio 999 posters featuring a kitchen radio poised at the edge of a TTC subway platform with the caption \"give your radio a reason to live,\" had appeared in Toronto, Toronto Public Space Committee criticized poster ad was \"in poor taste\". The city's transportation department later ordered the removal of the posters. According to TTC chair Adam Giambrone, the TTC had allowed the photo for the poster to be taken at a subway station based on a request to photograph various radios on TTC platforms. Although a supervisor was on site, there was no indication on how the photos would be used in the ad.\n\n"}
{"id": "2028163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028163", "title": "CIUT-FM", "text": "CIUT-FM\n\nCIUT-FM is a campus and community radio station owned and operated by the University of Toronto. The station broadcasts live and continuously from Toronto on the 89.5 FM frequency. Programming can also be heard nationally via channel 826 on Shaw Direct, and over the internet via the CIUT website. The station is financially supported by donations and an undergraduate student levy. CIUT-FM also broadcasts a Punjabi and Urdu language station, Sur Sagar Radio on a Subsidiary Communications Multiplex Operation frequency.\n\nCIUT's studios are located on Tower Road on the University of Toronto campus, while its transmitter is located atop First Canadian Place in Toronto's Financial District.\n\nThe station began as a closed-circuit broadcaster called \"Radio Varsity\" in 1966, later becoming \"Input Radio\", UTR and then CJUT. All these versions of the station were only heard within the confines of the University of Toronto, thanks to an extensive network of loudspeakers, amplifiers, and cables strung through the extensive underground network of steam tunnels beneath the University's St. George campus. The station was granted a broadcast license and became CIUT-FM in 1986, and on January 15, 1987, the station's FM broadcasts began to reach a considerably wider range across southern Ontario.\n\nIn 1999, CIUT was $150,000 in debt resulting in the student union taking over management, firing two employees, dismissing five volunteers, shortening time slots for other programs and selling late-night time slots to an internet broadcaster.\n\nThe next year, the station was sued by one of the dismissed programmers, Eddy Brake, who challenged his dismissal as well as the restructuring. The lawsuit was settled out of court in 2005.\n\nToday, CIUT broadcasts at 15 kilowatts from a transmitter on the top of First Canadian Place in Downtown Toronto. With greater signal power than generally found at other community radio stations, CIUT's broadcast reaches as far as Barrie to the north, Buffalo to the south, Kitchener to the west and Cobourg to the east.\n\nIn 2009, CIUT moved from 91 St. George Street, the Victorian house it had occupied for 40 years, to new studios in Hart House. The old location was demolished in order to make way for the expansion of the Rotman School of Management.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, CIUT's board of directors cancelled station manager Brian Burchell's contract due to financial irregularities. As a result, program director Ken Stowar was appointed to the additional role of station manager.\n\nIn 2012, CIUT filed a lawsuit against Burchell seeking damages of $162,193.68 for what \"The Varsity\" newspaper described as \"alleged long-term embezzlement\" prior to his firing in October 2010.\n\nIn 2014, the CIUT transmitter of 27 years died, shutting the station off the air for a couple of days until a backup transmitter could be shipped to Toronto from Nova Scotia. In the ensuing fundraising drive, money was raised and a new transmitter was installed and operating by August.\n\nPrograms in the spoken word (talk radio) format include: local politics, current events and news; as well as programs focused on Indigenous Peoples, Women in Politics, African Canadian Families, Community Activism, and Health Care.\n\nMusical programming includes many different genres such as folk, classical, Latino, world music, indie, rock, and electronic music. \nCIUT is the home of The Prophecy, the longest running drum and bass radio show in North America.\n\nFormer Radio Varsity/CIUT talent includes:\n\n"}
