See his propositions 6.4 onward.\n\nBut his motivation for writing, and the style of presentation, follow Frege and Russell, below.\n\n\nThese famous propositions, starting from 1, and ending at 7, are striking for their simplicity and ambition.\n\nProposition 6.5 (and its consequence) can not be understood until one realizes that Wittgenstein was a son of a family at the apex of Viennese culture, the capital of an empire (now vanished). In today's terms, the answer 6.5 is that from a man who some might view as possessed of the highest intellect, moral discrimination, and worldly wealth. He literally could do anything he wished. But his father, Karl, thought him untalented, in comparison to the rest of the family, which included musicians, and artists. He was schooled at home until age 14 (he later imposed his ideals on his hapless students after he had completed \"Tractatus\", and had undertaken training as a schoolteacher (1920)). He was assigned to study engineering and undertook the curriculum of a mechanical engineer at Berlin Technische Hochschule (1906).\n\nHe later attended the University of Manchester in England as a doctoral student in aeronautical engineering (1908). Thus Wittgenstein undertook the study of the foundation of mathematics, when he began to design jet propellers. But he refused to accept the propositions he encountered and brought his questions to Frege, who had undertaken a program to base mathematics on logic (1878). Frege, unable to counter his questions, referred him to Russell. Russell, by this time, had completed a work on Frege's program (1903), and was collaborating with Whitehead on \"Principia Mathematica\". He duly appeared at Cambridge (1911), where Russell assigned him a tutor, K.E. Johnson, for logic. After one hour, Johnson reported that Wittgenstein was teaching \"him\". But Russell had discovered some antinomies in logic, seriously calling into question Frege's program. Frege's program for logic as the basis of mathematics was now in shambles. Wittgenstein thus retired to Norway to work out his ideas (1913), and perhaps rescue Frege's program. This was the basis for his Tractatus.\n\nWhile in Norway, his father Karl died (1913), leaving him heir to a fortune, which he attempted to give away (much of it to his surviving siblings, on the condition that they not give any back to him). By 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was at war with Russell's British Empire, and Wittgenstein volunteered to fight for the Empire of Habsburg Vienna.\n\nWhile a soldier, before the serious fighting, he found a magazine article about a lawsuit involving a baby carriage and a truck. The court case re-enacted the incident with models. It was this event which made him realize that the subject of this process could be described by pictures as well as in words—the genesis of his \"picture theory of language\" (Tractatus 2.*). But this idea was already endemic in Viennese thought.\n\n\nIn this case, the elementary propositions, say \"a\". stand for ordinary sentences in ordinary language. They are not meant to be further analyzed, but are taken as givens.\n\nWittgenstein thus gives a notation which expresses an inductive form.\n\nIn this notation, ξ expresses the set of the arguments of truth function ξ, and N( ξ ) is the power set of ξ.\n\n\nThe conservation laws of physics stand as a statement of belief, in contrast with the \"a priori\" character of the logical form in 6.\n\nHistorically, the statements from 6.4 onward were ignored by the Vienna Circle and the other proponents of logical empiricism, as they simply did not know what to make of them. Wittgenstein was not present to bolster his case, as he was a schoolteacher and gardener at the moment that Tractatus was published. Afterward, he did not help his case by reciting the pacifist poems of Rabindranath Tagore to them, in place of analytic discussion. Indeed, 6.41 below seems to have a different character from the chain of thought stated above.\n\n\nBut 6.41 needs to be re-examined in this chain of justification.\nStatement 6.41 appears to be an appeal; the word \"must\" shows up in striking contrast to the rest of Tractatus, which consist of declarative statements. His usual economy in words is replaced by repetition. 6.41 is revisited below.\n\nWittgenstein himself was an exemplar of 7, by \"acting\" instead of \"speaking\", an ethical position. What actually impelled Wittgenstein, according to Janik and Toulmin, was the role models of a few men like Fritz Mauthner, as Wittgenstein himself set out to live the example of 7, as an engineer, a soldier, a schoolteacher, an architect, a gardener, a professor, a hospital orderly. As a professor, he attempted to follow up on \"Tractatus\", with his posthumous \"Philosophical Investigations\".\n\nThere is an ominous side-note to this action; at the same time that this Viennese was living his ideals, the forces of fascism were also acting to destroy the existing world order. These forces appeared not to be based on existing ethical principles, but on rather different ones based solely on might; the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore meant nothing to them, either.\n\nBecause 6.41 is different in character from the other propositions, a review is appropriate. Here we use the machinery of deontic modal logic, with the following conventions, but tag 6.41's statements with the type of statement:\n\n6.41 is an example of deontic modal logic. Wittgenstein is making statements of necessity of ethical action, rather than basing actions on contingent or accidental results, which he equates with the world. The doubling of the phrase \"no value\" is an indication that the statements are being made for different modalities.\n\n"}

The film turned out to be the second biggest blockbuster of the year, with Box Office India stating that Sridevi remained \"the undisputed No.1\". It was also named one of the best snake fantasy films by Yahoo. Times of India ranked \"Nagina\" as one of the 'Top 10 Snake Films of Hindi Cinema'. Sridevi's climax dance number 'Main Teri Dushman' also remains one of the best snake dances in Bollywood with Desi Hits calling it \"one of Sridevi's most iconic dance numbers...that still gives fans goose bumps\" and iDiva describing it as \"the stuff of movie legends\". Besides \"Nagina\", 1986 also saw Sridevi giving box-office hits in Subhash Ghai's multi-starrer \"Karma\" and Feroze Khan's \"Janbaaz\". According to CNN-IBN Bollywood Blockbusters, \"Sridevi's popularity grew so much that despite having a guest appearance in Janbaaz, she completely overshadowed the film's lead heroine Dimple Kapadia\".\n\nSridevi followed the success of \"Nagina\" by playing a goofy crime journalist in the 1987 film \"Mr. India\", described by Rediff as \"one of the most iconic films of its time\". Directed by Shekhar Kapur, it became one of the highest grossing hits of the year and also found a place in \"Hindustan Times\"' list of 'Top 10 Patriotic Films of Hindi Cinema'. While the trade famously joked that the film should have been named Miss India, Rediff.com also stated that \"Sri was a complete show-stealer in the film\". Sridevi's imitation of Charlie Chaplin in the film was described by \"The Times of India\" as \"the most hilarious act she has ever done\". Rediff also featured Sridevi in its list of 'Super Six Comic Heroines' stating that \"her mobile face expressions could give Jim Carrey sleepless nights\" and that \"her biggest plus point is her ability to be completely uninhibited in front of the camera\".\n\nThe dance number 'Hawa Hawai', cited by \"The\" \"Times of India\" as \"one of the unforgettable numbers of Sridevi\", also became a popular nickname for the actress. Besides comedy, Sridevi featured in the video for the song \"Kaate Nahin Kat Te\"; \"Filmfare\" described Sridevi as \"truly a goddess in a blue sari\". Rediff.com also featured the song in its list of 'Top 25 Sari Moments' praising Sridevi's \"ability to look erotic even when she's covered from head to toe\". Box Office India states that with the success of \"Mr. India\", Sridevi \"continued her domination\" over her contemporaries Jaya Prada and Meenakshi Sheshadri.\n\nIn 1989 came \"ChaalBaaz\", which had Sridevi in a double role, playing twin sisters separated at birth. \"Filmfare\" ranked her performance fourth in its list of '80 Iconic Performances of Hindi Cinema', stating that \"Sridevi's penchant for giggles and her ability to look distinctly tearful when required polishes these performances to perfection. Hell, she made Sunny Deol and Rajnikant look like sidekicks in the film\". \"The\" \"Times of India\" article 'Bollywood's Hit Double Roles' wrote, \"Sridevi's performance rocked the box office\". Rediff.com featured the film in its countdown of \"25 Best Double Roles in Bollywood\" saying \"What you don't realise until you have seen \"Chaalbaaz\" is just how incredible Sridevi is at depicting both ends of the spectrum\", and that the film \"cemented her position as an actress with a killer comic timing\". Speaking to \"The Indian Express\" about Sridevi's act in \"ChaalBaaz\", the director Pankaj Parashar said \"She proved her range with the movie and after that she got lots of offers which saw her in a double role\". Her slapstick rain dance \"Na Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai\" became successful with \"The Times of India\" describing it as a \"Sridevi classic where she simply looked wow with her chirpy expressions and rain drops kissing her cheeks\". The film won Sridevi her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress in Hindi films.\n\nThe same year also saw the release of the Yash Chopra romantic saga \"Chandni\", with Sridevi playing the title role. The film emerged as one of the biggest blockbusters of 1989. Cited by \"The Times of India\" as \"one of the most watched films of Indian cinema\", the film also reaffirmed Sridevi's position as the top female star of the 1980s. While she topped the \"Hindustan Times\" list of Yash Chopra's 'Top 5 Heroines', CNN-IBN also ranked her first on a similar list, saying \"Yash Chopra immortalised Sridevi as the perfect Chandni\". \"India Today\" and NDTV also included her in such lists, stating that the film established Sridevi \"as the nation's sweetheart\". \"The Tribune\" wrote: \"Leena Daru scored a winner again when she created the 'Chandni Look' for Sridevi. Every street corner sold the salwar-kameez and dupatta that gave the heroine a refreshingly understated look, rarely seen on the Indian screen\", Sridevi's dance number \"Mere Hathon Mein Nau Nau Choodiyan\" proved also popular with audiences, and she also lent her voice to the film's popular title-track. Sridevi garnered Filmfare Best Actress nominations for both \"Chandni\" and \"ChaalBaaz\" in 1989, winning with the latter.\nYash Chopra again cast Sridevi in his 1991 film \"Lamhe\". \"The Times of India\" included it in its list of 'Top 10 Films of Yash Chopra' describing it as a tale of \"love transcending the boundaries of time and space\" while Rediff called it \"Quite easily one of his most definitive films, Chopra surpassed his own findings of romance with the insightful, lovely Lamhe\". Sridevi played both mother and daughter roles in what iDiva described as \"another double role, but it was unlike any played before\". Hailed by Rediff as \"one of the most remarkable films of her career...often considered a film way ahead of its time\", Sridevi's folk dance number 'Morni Baga ma' also became a rage and was placed among the 'Top 5 Songs' of Yash Chopra by Hindustan Times. \"Lamhe\" failed commercially but received high critical praise and has over the years become a cult classic. Talking about the film, critic Rachel Dwyer wrote in her biography of the film-maker \"Yash Chopra's own favourite film, Lamhe ('Moments', 1991), divided the audience on a class basis: it was hugely popular with metropolitan elites and the overseas market, which allowed it to break even, but it had a poor box office response (largely lower class, especially the repeat audience) because of its supposed incest theme\". The Hindu reported that \"With shades of incest, Lamhe caused more than a flutter and remained the talk of the town\",\nwhile Sridevi herself admitted in an interview with Rajeev Masand that she found the subject \"too bold\".\nThough the film flopped with Rediff describing its failure as \"one of those bizarre, unexplained moments of cinema\", \"Lamhe\" picked up five Filmfare trophies including Filmfare Award for Best Film and Sridevi's second Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Her popular Rajasthani costumes in the film also won designer Neeta Lulla her first National Film Award for Best Costume Design.\n\nIn 1992, Sridevi starred in the epic \"Khuda Gawah\" opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The actress played a double role again as an Afghan warrior Benazir and her daughter Mehendi. Shot mostly in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, it did good business with BBC reporting that \"it ran to packed houses for 10 weeks in Kabul\". \"Khuda Gawah\" still remains popular in Afghanistan and Rediff reported that the film is \"in great demand after the re-opening of cinema halls in the country\" in 2001. The film picked up the Filmfare Award for Best Director while Sridevi earned a Filmfare nomination for Best Actress. The actress's big budget 1993 release \"Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja\" was one of India's most expensive films ever made. Though the film failed at the box office, Sridevi was appreciated with Times of India calling her disguise in a comedy scene \"the best ever South Indian role played by any actress\".\n\nSridevi next starred in the 1993 thriller \"Gumrah\", opposite Sanjay Dutt. Directed by Mahesh Bhatt, the actress played a singer falsely accused of drugs smuggling in Hong Kong. Bollyspice stated in its 'Sridevi Retrospective' that \"Despite very good performances from the rest of the cast, Gumrah was really Sridevi's film. She managed to exemplify female emotion and robustness to a great degree that you remember the film largely for her significant contribution towards it\". Her performance received another nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award. In 1994, Sridevi teamed up with Anil Kapoor again in \"Laadla\" playing business tycoon Sheetal Jaitley. The character, described by Times of India as \"rude, dominant and very competitive\" brought her yet another Filmfare nomination.\n\nShe acted in her comeback film in Malayalam in 1996 Bharathan's \"Devaraagam\", a love story in which she starred opposite Aravind Swamy. The last major film Sridevi starred in before she took a break from the industry was \"Judaai\", released in 1997. Along with Anil Kapoor and Urmila Matondkar, the actress played a greedy housewife going to extreme lengths for money. Talking about her swan song, critic Subhash K. Jha wrote that Sridevi \"left us with the most stunning hurrah in \"Judaai\". A terrible film that I've watched countless times to see her play the money-minded harridan who 'sells' her husband to Urmila Matondkar. Who but Sridevi could carry of such an outrageous role with such enthusiastic élan?!\" while Bollyspice stated that \"She used her polished acting skills to illustrate her character’s greed and individualism at such a grotesque level.\" \"Judaai\" won Sridevi her eighth Filmfare nomination for Best Actress, following this she retired from acting.\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, Sridevi briefly returned to the small screen in the Sahara sitcom \"Malini Iyer\" (2004–2005). She also appeared on \"Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai\" (2004) and as a judge in the TV show \"Kaboom\" (2005). She performed a medley of some of her musical numbers at the 52nd Filmfare Awards 2007. She was also a member of the Board of Directors at the Asian Academy of Film & Television.\n\nOn 19 September 2009, Sridevi appeared on the Sony TV show \"10 Ka Dum\".\n\nOn 13 May 2012, Sridevi appeared on the Star Plus Talk show \"Satyamev Jayate\".\n\nSridevi has also developed a passion for painting.

In the film, she played Shashi Godbole, a housewife who enrolls in an English-speaking course after her husband and daughter's mocking of her English skills. The film and Sridevi's performance received positive response. \"The Times of India\" called it \"easily one of the best films of 2012\" and Sridevi's performance \"a masterclass for actors.\" Raja Sen of Rediff found the film \"a winner all the way [...] Sri excels in fleshing out her character\", and critic Subhash K. Jha said Sridevi \"makes the contemporary actresses, even the coolest ones, look like jokes...If you watch only two films every year make sure you see \"English Vinglish\" twice!\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote Sridevi delivers \"a performance that is nothing short of perfect [...] It's warm and fuzzy, and leaves you with a big smile on your face.\" \"Sridevi doesn't miss a beat. Her performance is a triumph\", added the critic Anupama Chopra. Komal Nahta said she \"makes the best comeback in Bollywood history and delivers a landmark performance.\"\n\nWith the success of \"English Vinglish\", Sridevi became the only actress in Bollywood to make a successful comeback as a leading lady after marriage and a long hiatus. Shinde featured her in the \"Financial Times\" 2012 list of '25 Indians To Watch'. She topped Rediff.com's annual listing of the \"Bollywood's Best Actresses\" in 2012; the website wrote \"English Vinglish\" \"is a simple film where things are credible, never melodramatic\" and Sridevi \"always judges the tone right. It's the sort of performance younger actresses [...] should learn from.\" Sridevi was declared the most-admired Bollywood actress of 2012 in a mobile survey conducted by Vuclip, the world's largest mobile research company. She was nominated for several awards, including her ninth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. Following an appearance during the song \"Apna Bombay Talkies\" in the film \"Bombay Talkies\" (2013), Sridevi starred in the Tamil fantasy action adventure film \"Puli\" (2015), which became her last Tamil film before her death in 2018.\nSridevi was next seen in her home production titled \"Mom\" (2017), which marked her 300th film. In the thriller film, she played a mother who sets out to avenge the rape of her daughter. Sridevi said that as a mother and an artiste, she empathized with her character's rage, and found it hard to be in a normal state during the filming. \"Mom\" was released on 7 July 2017 to generally positive reviews, with critics widely appreciating Sridevi's performance. \"The Times of India\" and \"The Indian Express\" added Sridevi \"demonstrates why she is the high-priestess of Indian cinema\" and that she \"needs only a twitch or a glance to prove that she is a powerhouse and there are several scenes she lifts by just being there.\" For her performance, Sridevi received the National Film Award for Best Actress and earned nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and Screen Award for Best Actress. At the time of her death, Sridevi was not shooting for any upcoming films; her last on-screen appearance was in Aanand L. Rai's film \"Zero\" (2018) in a cameo. Sridevi had signed the 2019 film \"Kalank\", produced by Karan Johar; however, due to her demise she was replaced by Madhuri Dixit. Another film she had signed, the Malayalam film \"Sree Sree Devaraagam\", a sequel to Sridevi's own 1996 hit film \"Devaraagam\", was subsequently shelved after her death.\n\nSridevi is cited by media publications as a fashion icon. Her taste in clothes was varied and ranged from stylish casual to opulently majestic. She made her debut as a fashion model in 2008. The actress modelled clothes for designers Priya and Chintan at the Lakme Fashion Week. The next year, she displayed the work of jewelry designer Queenie Dhodhy at the HDIL India Couture Week. She worked at Lakme Fashion Week again in 2010, and at Delhi Couture Week 2012, showing clothes designed by Sabyasachi Mukherjee.\n\nShe has also appeared on the cover of several fashion magazines.

Sanjay Ramaswamy is married to her sister Srilatha since 1989.\n\nHer father died in 1991, while she was shooting for \"Lamhe\". Her mother died in 1996, as a result of the complications suffered from an operation that she underwent in 1995 on a brain tumor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The neurosurgeon operated on the wrong side of her brain destroying her vital tissues of vision and recent memory. This was widely reported in US media at that time which then led to a successful court battle and prompted then President Bill Clinton’s proposal of a program for hospitals to disclose their medical malpractice and errors.\n\nSridevi was extremely discreet about her privacy and rarely gave interviews or discussed her private life in them. In the 1980s she was reported to have married actor Mithun Chakraborty, whom she met on the sets of \"Jaag Utha Insan\" (1984). In 1996, she married producer Boney Kapoor. The couple had two daughters, Janhvi (born in 1997), who is herself an actress, and Khushi (born in 2000). Sridevi was brought up as a vegetarian.\n\nDespite being known for her portrayals of a strong, vivacious and exuberant woman on-screen, Sridevi was an extremely introverted and reserved person off-screen. \"CNN-IBN\" correspondent Rajeev Masand says; \"I have never known anyone who was so painfully shy, so quiet off screen, who just transformed into a force of nature when the cameras came on. She was an interviewer’s nightmare, but the movie-buff’s dream\". Commenting on her reserved nature, \"Firstpost\" says; \"Behind the glamourous heroine with twinkling, magical eyes and a stunning face, was an inherently shy woman, often mistaken as arrogant. The truth is she was shy. Having begun to act when she was just 12, she did not complete formal education or get much of a chance to interact with kids of her own age. Consequently, she developed a strong dislike for crowds and noise.\"\n\nOn 20 February 2018, Sridevi and her youngest daughter Khushi had flown to Al Jazirah Al Hamra in Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, to attend the wedding of her nephew Mohit Marwah. She decided to spend a couple of days in Dubai to shop for her eldest daughter Janhvi Kapoor's 21st birthday, after the wedding. Her husband Boney Kapoor was not present with them on the wedding day as he had to attend a meeting in Lucknow on 22 February. However he had already planned a surprise visit to his wife, with whom he spoke on the morning of 24 February, when she told him that \"Papa (that's how Sridevi addressed Boney), I'm missing you.\" According to Kapoor, he took a 15:30 flight to Dubai and reached Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel around 18:20 (Dubai time) in room 2201 where the actress was staying. She and Kapoor briefly met and chatted for half an-hour or so. Afterwards they decided to have dinner. Sridevi went to bathe and to get dressed for dinner, while Kapoor waited in a living room. After 15–20 minutes, around 19:00, he called out to the actress as they were getting late but was unable to get a response.\n\nSridevi was pronounced dead on 24 February 2018 at 19:00 GMT in her hotel room where her husband had found her. At first, it was announced by her brother in-law Sanjay Kapoor to the Indian media that the cause of death was a cardiac arrest, but the investigation to her death began early Sunday morning around 2:30, and the case was transferred to Dubai Public Prosecution by Dubai Police, where General Department of Forensic Evidence, Dubai revealed that the cause of death was \"accidental drowning\". The toxicology report later also revealed that traces of alcohol were found in her body, and water was found in her lungs.\n\nAfter rumors that news of her death was an Internet hoax, her brother-in-law, Sanjay Kapoor, confirmed that it was indeed true. Her fans, co-stars and other Bollywood stars posted condolences on Twitter to mourn the death. After a few days of police investigation, on 27 February, Sridevi's case was closed, and on the night of that day, her body was flown back to Mumbai, India. Ashraf Thamarassery, a Keralite who helped bring back her body to India by her husband and her stepson, Arjun Kapoor, on a private jet belonging to Anil Ambani. Her funeral took place on 28 February, at the Vile Parle Seva Samaj Crematorium in Mumbai. The final rites were performed by her husband Boney Kapoor. Sridevi was cremated with state honours and also received a gun salute at her funeral. Her pyre was lit by her husband. On 3 March, Sridevi's ashes were flown into Tamil Nadu via Chennai by her husband and her two daughters Jhanvi and Khushi and later taken to and immersed in the sea off the coast of Rameshwaram.\n\nThe film industry, friends, and fans responded to her death through social and other media outlets. Her husband, Boney Kapoor, wrote: “To the world, she was their Chandni, the actor par excellence, their Sridevi, but to me, she was my love, my friend, mother to our girls, my partner. To our daughters, she was their everything, their life. She was the axis around which our family ran.\" The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi lamented the death of the actress. On social media he stated: \"Saddened by the untimely demise of noted actor Sridevi. She was a veteran of the film industry, whose long career included diverse roles and memorable performances. My thoughts are with her family and admirers in this hour of grief. May her soul rest in peace.\" President Ramnath Kovind wrote: \"Shocked to hear of passing of movie star Sridevi. She has left millions of fans heartbroken. Her performances in films such as 'Moondram Pirai', 'Lamhe' and 'English Vinglish' remain an inspiration for other actors. My condolences to her family and close associates.\"\n\nMany from the film fraternity and close relatives of Sridevi paid homage to her at Celebration Sports Club in Lokhandwala and also at her funeral. Thousands of fans took to streets and paid their respects to the actress. Police had to resort to lathi-charge to control the number of fans who gathered for the procession from Celebration Sports Complex to the crematorium, the crowd was said to be more than 7,000.\n\nSridevi's funeral is estimated to have attracted the fourth highest number of mourners, ranking below the 3 previous biggest funeral processions of non political film personalities Mohammad Rafi, Kishore Kumar and Rajesh Khanna in India from Hindi film industry.\n\nIn a highly exceptional move, the film actress became one of the few people from the Indian entertainment industry to be accorded with full state honours usually reserved only for current and former prime ministers, union and state ministers. Sridevi was included in 2018 \"In Memoriam\" section during the 90th Academy Awards ceremony.\nOn the occasion of Sridevi's birthday on 13 August 2019, Madame Tussauds, Singapore has announced that a wax statue would soon be dedicated to her. The statue is a replica of Sridevi's look in the hit Hindi film song, Hawa Hawai from ‘80s film, Mr India. Her daughters, Janhvi Kapoor and Khushi, were present at the ceremony accompanied by her husband, producer Boney Kapoor.\n\nSridevi is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actresses of Indian cinema. Due to her pan-Indian appeal, she is cited as one of the most popular actresses of Indian cinema. Highly regarded for her range as an actor, critics have commended particularly her comedic abilities and her skills as a dancer. During the 1980s, Sridevi was the highest earning woman in the Indian entertainment industry. For her role in \"Mr. India\" (1987), she was paid a then unprecedented ₹11 lakhs, making her the highest paid Indian actress ever. In a 2013 national poll conducted by CNN-IBN on the occasion of the centenary of Indian cinema, Sridevi was voted \"India's Greatest Actress in 100 Years\", and she placed tenth in a UK poll, \"100 Greatest Bollywood Stars\", in the same year. In 2012, Sridevi was placed at the second position by NDTV in the listing of \"The most popular Bollywood actresses of all time\". Sridevi featured in Box Office India's \"Top Actresses\" list for ten consecutive years (1983–93). A biography of her named Sridevi: The Eternal Screen Goddess, written by screenwriter Satyarth Nayak was released in 2019.\n\nAn epitaph in \"Firstpost\" pointed out that Sridevi had been sufficiently important as an actor to be able to refuse parts in movies, and \"The News Minute\" called her \"a pathbreaker in many ways\". \"The Guardian\" called her \"the undisputed queen of Indian Cinema\" .\nFilm critic Sukanya Verma described Sridevi as \"one of a kind\". She wrote, \"Sridevi's biggest plus point is her ability to be completely uninhibited in front of the camera.\"\n\nSridevi's performances, acting style and technique have been influential and have inspired numerous actresses including Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukherji, Juhi Chawla, Karishma Kapoor, Kajol, Preity Zinta, Priyanka Chopra, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, Asin, Kajal Aggarwal, Anushka Shetty, Vidya Balan, and Alia Bhatt, who have cited her as an inspiration. In a piece for \"Time magazine\", Priyanka Chopra wrote, \"Everyone wanted her and wanted to be like her. She could be childlike, grown up, funny, serious, beguiling, sexy—she was the ultimate actor. [...] She was my childhood, and one of the big reasons I became an actor.\"\n\nIn the Telugu biopic \"\", Sridevi was portrayed by Rakul Preet Singh.\n\n\n\n"}

Baker was surrounded by music as a little girl but she objected when her musical family launched into their repertoire of country songs. She preferred rock 'n' roll. She even objected her father, a fiddler with many accomplishments, according to Baker her father said to her \"one day, you'll love country music.\" She doubted it. Growing up in a small town in Nova Scotia, Baker was immediately drawn to singing and making music with her friends and get into some occasional trouble as she states \"there was nothing to do, except get into trouble, and we did our share of that too.\" She made her first appearance singing in her local church. During her teen years, she was practicing regularly and singing for her church on Sundays, she states \"I worked every church in town, the Anglican church in the morning, the Baptist church in the afternoon and the Pentecostal at night.\" Port Medway's population was too small to have a school so she went to school at a nearby village named Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, approximately 40 kilometers north of where she lived. Her talent was not recognized right away, however, at school she claims she was considered as one of the \"hicks from the sticks\" and the local glee club wouldn't let her sing. At age 16, she moved to Toronto. When she heard country music at Toronto, she said it made her homesick for Nova Scotia and that is where her love for country music began. She made her first stage debut in 1968 when her husband persuaded her to get on stage with a local band that was playing at the bar, the band members were initially impressed even asking her to join them, however, they soon became frustrated with her lack of progress and they eventually let her go.\n\nSongwriter George Petralia heard Baker sing and introduced her to producer Don Grashey. Her first single in 1970, \"Mem-ries of Home\", was written by Petralia and released on Grashey's Gaiety label. It was a minor hit, staying on the charts for 26 weeks. Based on the success of this first recording, Grashey contacted several record companies regarding a recording contract for her and finally made a deal with Columbia Records.\n\nShe recorded two albums for Columbia with limited commercial success. Eventually she went back to Gaiety Records. She then was signed to RCA Records where she had several gold and platinum records. From RCA, she joined Tembo records where she was again awarded platinum record status for her record sales.\n\nIn 1973, Baker became pregnant and announced her intention to withdraw from music business. Grashey convinced her to continue, and the pair traveled to Nashville to record four songs. Her first top ten record came from that session, \"Ten Little Fingers\", a song about a little girl, written by Don Grashey; this song remains one of her most popular songs to this day. She also had a hit with a bluegrass remake of \"It's My Party\". All told, between 1970 and 1982 Baker released 31 consecutive charting singles. Twelve of these reached the top of the charts.\n\nBaker had her own series on CBC television in the summer of 1983 and frequently appeared on Tommy Hunter's show. In 1986, her album \"Hymns of Gold\" was certified platinum.\n\nBaker received the Juno Award for Country Female Vocalist of the Year five times, including awards in 1977, 1978 and 1979. In 1976, she won a Big Country Award for best album of the year, and in 1978 and 1977 she was named top female country singer at the same awards.\n\nShe was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2009, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada \"for her achievements as a Canadian country music singer and songwriter\".\n\n"}

It commemorates Fredrik Granatenhjelm, a notable artillery officer from the Suomenlinna fortress, who later moved to the mainland Helsinki proper, gaining great repute as a philanthropist.\n\nA Swedish Royal Knight; a veteran of the Seven Years' War and the War of the Caps, Fredrik Granatenhjelm (May 1, 1708 - December 13, 1784), is buried in the grave. Despite the monument's name, possibly derived from its square and compasses decorations, it is not known whether Granatenhjelm himself was a member of the Freemasons. Some historians have been led to assume it, perhaps out of weight from the popular designation of the monument. It is known for certain that he was posthumously made an honorary member of the quasi-masonic Walhalla-orden.\n\nThe spot was chosen as it was the location where the officer habitually rested on his daily constitutionals, then within Edboms decorative garden, and where he had expressed a wish to be buried. The Walhalla-orden took these wishes to King Gustaf III and gained permission to bury him outside church grounds, when he was examining the troops at Parola, during his visit to Finland. The order's members were also the ones who carried his casket into the ground.\n\nThe grave monument is exceptional within the city in that it is not within a church yard. At the site of Helsinki's first church, the gravestone of a single tradesman is all that has been retained to designate the spot, but Freemason's Grave differs in that it was intended to be a solitary grave from the start. Another similar case is the urn of poet Katri Vala which is set at a spot adjacent to her eponymous park in the Sörnäinen neighbourhood.\n\nOriginally a statue was planned for the site, but when that plan failed, Lars Jägerhorm was able to get a commemorative stone and guardrails around it. The masonic symbols of that guardrail that have led to the popular designation of the monument as a \"Freemason's grave\". The unbeaten stone face bears the freehand style inscription: \"\"Lika godt om verlden vet hvem här hvilar alt nog Gud käner hvad Han gjort och Uslingen välsignar HANS minne.\"\" (\"As little as the world cares who lies here, God will nevertheless know his deeds and the wretched bless HIS memory.\")\n\nAn evergreen conifer is planted next to the stone, and an ironwork guardrail with masonic square and compass are featured within the rails; this decoration and the inscription on the stone is kept painted with gold. The emblems of field artillery, incendiary grenades, are set as knobs to top the posts at the corners of the ironworks; palpably also a play of words on his family name \"Granatenhjelm\".\n"}

He first played football for his local team, the Jerilderie Football Club, when it was part of the Murray Football League. He boarded for three years in Kilmore, Victoria, at Assumption College, one of Australia's most renowned \"football nurseries\", a school which has a strong tradition of producing footballers who have gone on to play in the AFL. In 1984, his final year at the school, Brownless kicked 155 goals for the school team.\n\nGeelong asked Brownless to come and train, but instead he chose to return home to Jerilderie to be with family and friends and play a season of senior football before going to Geelong. During the 1985 season, he kicked 148 goals for the Jerilderie senior team while working as a farmhand. Jerilderie made it to the grand final but lost. Brownless kicked six of the team's nine goals despite having injured an ankle in the semi-final.\n\nBrownless moved to Geelong in time for the 1986 VFL season and began working as a groundsman at Kardinia Park. He said that playing for Geelong was a natural progression for him because of the town's rural atmosphere:\n\"It's really like a big country town and the club's a lot like a country club. You're all behind one another and you're all pretty close. It's a good feeling.\"\nBrownless made his senior VFL debut in Round 1, 1986 and quickly made a name for himself as a strong full-forward, winning the Cats' best first year player award that year. He went on to play 198 games and kick 441 goals, putting him fifth in Geelong's all-time goalkicking list, behind Gary Ablett (1021), Doug Wade (834) Tom Hawkins (545) and Steve Johnson (452).\n\nOne of Brownless' fondest memories was kicking a goal after the siren against Footscray in their 1994 qualifying final. With Geelong trailing by one point, he marked the ball within scoring range with just seconds left and kicked a goal to send Geelong through to the next stage of the finals. While the Cats eventually made it to the grand final, they lost that match. Brownless played in four losing grand final teams with Geelong.\n\nBrownless retired in 1997 at 30 years of age.\n\nBrownless has the record for most goals in a game at the Gabba, with 11.\n\nBrownless first played State of Origin in 1988 for New South Wales. Playing in the State of Origin Carnival that year, he kicked three goals in the tournament, two in the first against South Australia and one in the second against Western Australia. In 1993 he again played in the State of Origin Carnival, being selected for NSW/ACT against Victoria. With Wayne Carey and John Longmire in the side, Brownless played at centre half back. In 1995 he kicked five goals and was named in the best players for Allies in a win over Western Australia.\n\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1986\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1987\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1988\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1989\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1990\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1991\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1992\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1993\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1994\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1995\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1996\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1997\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 198\n! 441\n! 291\n! 1757\n! 822\n! 2579\n! 1058\n! 161\n! 2.2\n! 1.5\n! 8.9\n! 4.2\n! 13.0\n! 5.3\n! 0.9\n\nWhen Brownless retired from football he moved into the media, appearing regularly on \"The Footy Show\". On \"The Footy Show\" he appeared in \"The House of Bulger\" segment as the family's matriarch Joybell Bulger.\n\nHe joined 95.5 K-Rock in Geelong as a sales representative. Soon, on their \"Big Mattress\" breakfast show, he co-hosted a sport/comedy segment called \"On The Bench\" with ex-Geelong player Dwayne Russell and the Essendon fanatic \"Ferret\" (Russell Taylor), twice a week. A long list of Geelong players were included in \"On The Bench\" as special guests including Barry Stoneham, Tim McGrath and Paul Couch.\n\nIn 1992 he became the inaugural winner of the Mirrool Silo Kick in the Riverina, kicking an Aussie Rules football 32 metres plus over the Mirrool Silos.\n\nIn August 1999, it was reported that due to Brownless' connections in the local political scene, both the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the ruling Liberal Party of Australia were keen to recruit Brownless into politics, despite his limited experience. Labor leader Steve Bracks, who would go on to win the state election that year, was a Geelong supporter, and Brownless had persuaded the then Premier Jeff Kennett's wife, Felicity, to become Geelong's female number one ticket holder.\n\nAs of 2005, Brownless has featured on \"The Sunday Footy Show\", as well as continuing his appearances on \"The Footy Show\". He also co-hosted \"Morning Glory\", a weekday breakfast show on Melbourne radio station SEN 1116. Brownless finished his 5-day a week stint in November 2008. Brownless appeared on Before the Bounce, a weekly football show on Foxtel alongside Jason Dunstall and Danny Frawley until the end of the 2008 AFL season.\n\nIn May 2008, Brownless was added as a regular on the Thursday night AFL Footy Show to replace an incapacitated Sam Newman, but was relegated to guest panelist upon Newman's return. Since 2009 Brownless has once again became a regular alongside Shane Crawford to replace Trevor Marmalade, Alternating each week with Crawford & since 2012, Matthew Lloyd.\n\nIn March 2010 Brownless joined Triple M Melbourne's new drive show \"The Rush Hour\" with James Brayshaw.\n\nBrownless bought the Cumberland Hotel in Castlemaine, Victoria. He also owns the Cremorne Hotel in Newtown, Victoria \n\nIn January 2020, Brownless appeared in the sixth season of the Australian version of \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\".\n\nBrownless was married to Nicky. They have two daughters, Lucy and Ruby, and two sons, Oscar and Max.\n\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music (now incorporated in the Royal Northern College of Music), studying composition with Richard Hall and piano with Iso Elinson, graduating with distinction in 1948. He married Marjorie Spedding in 1952. He moved to Scotland in the mid-1950s. As a socialist pacifist conscientious objector, he applied for exemption from National Service, but was refused recognition by the North Western Tribunal. He, in turn, refused to attend a medical examination as an essential preliminary to call-up, which led to prosecution and sentence to 12 months imprisonment in Wormwood Scrubs. The sentence qualified him to go to the Appellate Tribunal, which finally allowed exemption from military service conditional upon work on the land.\n\nAmong his many compositions, the largest (in terms of duration) and most famous is his \"Passacaglia on DSCH\" for solo piano, written between 1960 and 1962, based on a 13-note ground bass derived from the musical motif D-E-C-B: the German transliteration of Dmitri Shostakovich's initials (\"D. Sch.\"). Stevenson's work takes more than an hour and a quarter to perform and is one of the longest unbroken single movements composed for piano.\n\nStevenson's other works include two piano concertos, the second of which was first performed at the Proms in 1972, a violin concerto commissioned by Yehudi Menuhin, and a cello concerto in memoriam Jacqueline du Pré. He also wrote several chamber works including a String Quartet and Piano Quartet, numerous songs (among these, many settings of Hugh MacDiarmid, William Soutar and James Joyce) and works for solo piano. In 2007 he completed a choral symphony, \"Ben Dorain\", on Hugh MacDiarmid's translation of the poem of that name by Duncan Ban MacIntyre. This work, for full chorus and chamber choir with chamber orchestra and symphony orchestra, was begun in the 1960s and laid aside for many years. The world premiere was given in City Halls, Glasgow, on 19 January 2008 by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, with the composer present.\n\nStevenson was very active as a transcriber of music other than his own, chiefly for the piano, in the tradition of Ferrucio Busoni, Percy Grainger and Leopold Godowsky. His transcriptions covered composers as diverse as Henry Purcell and Frederick Delius. Notable examples include piano solo versions of Grainger's \"Hill Song No.1\" (originally for wind orchestra), the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Tenth Symphony, and of the six unaccompanied violin sonatas of Eugène Ysaÿe as piano sonatas. There is also a collection of piano solos based on songs from the 19th and 20th centuries entitled \"L'art nouveau de chant appliqué au piano\", a title that recalls deliberately the collection of song-transcriptions by Sigismond Thalberg. Stevenson made many arrangements of folk music from countries as far apart as Scotland and China, while many of his own works exist in several different instrumentations.\n\nStevenson was also noted as a teacher. He was senior lecturer in composition at the University of Cape Town in the mid-1960s, delivered seminars at the Juilliard School in New York, and was responsible for a course entitled \"The Political Piano\" at the University of York in the early 1980s.\n\nStevenson died on 28 March 2015, aged 87 at his home in West Linton, Scotland. His widow and three children survive him. His daughter Savourna Stevenson (born 1961) has recorded many works on the Scottish harp. His daughter Gerda Stevenson is a film and theatre actress, and a poet. His granddaughter Anna Wendy Stevenson is a Scots folk fiddler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to helping promote the European integration, this doctrine also provides the basis for analyses that characterise European politics, economics, and society as reflecting a shared identity. Opponents to the idea stress that there are various differences among European groups and that the factors seen as characteristic of this shared culture do not necessarily follow its premise.\n\nThe philosophers Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida wrote an article for the newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" in which they claimed the birth of a 'European public sphere'. \nThey argued that new values and habits had given contemporary Europe 'its own face', and saw an opportunity for the construction of a 'core Europe' (excluding Britain and Eastern Europe) that might be a counterweight to the United States.\n\nAttempting to explain what Europe represented, the two philosophers listed six facets of what they described as a common European 'political mentality':\n\n\nHowever it could be argued that at least some of these values do not at all apply in eastern Europe.\n\nPolitical scientist John McCormick expands on these ideas, and identifies the following as core attributes of Europeanism:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1938822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938822", "title": "HERG", "text": "HERG\n\nhERG (the human \" Ether-à-go-go\"-Related Gene) is a gene () that codes for a protein known as K11.1, the alpha subunit of a potassium ion channel. This ion channel (sometimes simply denoted as 'hERG') is best known for its contribution to the electrical activity of the heart: the hERG channel mediates the repolarizing \"I\" current in the cardiac action potential, which helps coordinate the heart's beating. \n\nWhen this channel's ability to conduct electrical current across the cell membrane is inhibited or compromised, either by application of drugs or by rare mutations in some families, it can result in a potentially fatal disorder called long QT syndrome. Conversely, genetic mutations that increase the current through these channels can lead to the related inherited heart rhythm disorder Short QT syndrome. A number of clinically successful drugs in the market have had the tendency to inhibit hERG, lengthening the QT and potentially leading to a fatal irregularity of the heartbeat (a ventricular tachyarrhythmia called torsades de pointes). This has made hERG inhibition an important antitarget that must be avoided during drug development. \n\nhERG has also been associated with modulating the functions of some cells of the nervous system and with establishing and maintaining cancer-like features in leukemic cells.\n\nhERG forms the major portion of one of the ion channel proteins (the 'rapid' delayed rectifier current (\"I\")) that conducts potassium (K) ions out of the muscle cells of the heart (cardiac myocytes), and this current is critical in correctly timing the return to the resting state (repolarization) of the cell membrane during the cardiac action potential. Sometimes, when referring to the pharmacological effects of drugs, the terms \"hERG channels\" and \"I\" are used interchangeably, but, in the technical sense, \"hERG channels\" can be made only by scientists in the laboratory; in formal terms, the naturally occurring channels in the body that include hERG are referred to by the name of the electrical current that has been measured in that cell type, so, for example, in the heart, the correct name is \"I\". This difference in nomenclature becomes clearer in the controversy as to whether the channels conducting \"I\" include other subunits (e.g., beta subunits) or whether the channels include a mixture of different types (isoforms) of hERG, but, when the originally-discovered form of hERG is experimentally transferred into cells that previously lacked hERG (i.e., heterologous expression), a potassium ion channel is formed, and this channel has many signature features of the cardiac 'rapid' delayed rectifier current (\"I\"), including \"I\"'s inward rectification that results in the channel producing a 'paradoxical resurgent current' in response to repolarization of the membrane.\n\nA detailed atomic structure for hERG based on X-ray crystallography is not yet available, but structures have recently been solved by electron microscopy. In the laboratory the heterologously expressed hERG potassium channel comprises 4 identical alpha subunits, which form the channel's pore through the plasma membrane. Each hERG subunit consists of 6 transmembrane alpha helices, numbered S1-S6, a pore helix situated between S5 and S6, and cytoplasmically located N- and C-termini. The S4 helix contains a positively charged arginine or lysine amino acid residue at every 3rd position and is thought to act as a voltage-sensitive sensor, which allows the channel to respond to voltage changes by changing conformations between conducting and non-conducting states (called 'gating'). Between the S5 and S6 helices, there is an extracellular loop (known as 'the turret') and 'the pore loop', which begins and ends extracellularly but loops into the plasma membrane; the pore loop for each of the hERG subunits in one channel face into the ion-conducting pore and are adjacent to the corresponding loops of the 3 other subunits, and together they form the selectivity filter region of the channel pore. The selectivity sequence, SVGFG, is very similar to that contained in bacterial KcsA channels. Although a full crystal structure for hERG is not yet available, a structure has been found for the cytoplasmic N-terminus, which was shown to contain a PAS domain (aminoacid 26-135) that slows the rate of deactivation.\n\nLoss of function mutations in this channel may lead to long QT syndrome (LQT2), while gain of function mutations may lead to short QT syndrome. Both clinical disorders stem from ion channel dysfunction (so-called channelopathies) that can lead to the risk of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., \"torsades de pointes\"), due to repolarization disturbances of the cardiac action potential. There are far more hERG mutations described for long QT syndrome than for short QT syndrome.\n\nThis channel is also sensitive to drug binding, as well as decreased extracellular potassium levels, both of which can result in decreased channel function and drug-induced (acquired) long QT syndrome. Among the drugs that can cause QT prolongation, the more common ones include antiarrhythmics (especially Class 1A and Class III), anti-psychotic agents, and certain antibiotics (including quinolones and macrolides).\n\nAlthough there exist other potential targets for cardiac adverse effects, the vast majority of drugs associated with acquired QT prolongation are known to interact with the hERG potassium channel. One of the main reasons for this phenomenon is the larger inner vestibule of the hERG channel, thus providing more space for many different drug classes to bind and block this potassium channel.\n\nhERG containing channels are blocked by amiodarone.\n\nDue to the documented potential of QT-interval-prolonging drugs, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued recommendations for the establishment of a cardiac safety profile during pre-clinical drug development: ICH S7B. The nonclinical evaluation of the potential for delayed ventricular repolarization (QT interval prolongation) by human pharmaceuticals, issued as CHMP/ICH/423/02, adopted by CHMP in May 2005. Preclinical hERG studies should be accomplished in GLP environment.\n\nThe hERG gene was first named and described in a paper by Jeff Warmke and Barry Ganetzky, then both at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The hERG gene is the human homolog of the \"Ether-à-go-go\" gene found in the Drosophila fly; \"Ether-à-go-go\" was named in the 1960s by William D. Kaplan and William E. Trout, III, while at the City of Hope Hospital in Duarte, California. When flies with mutations in the \"Ether-à-go-go\" gene are anaesthetised with ether, their legs start to shake, like the dancing at the then popular Whisky A Go-Go nightclub in West Hollywood, California.\n\nHERG has been shown to interact with the 14-3-3 epsilon protein, encoded by YWHAE.\n\n\n\n"}

Her professional career started in the early 1980s, under the name \"Jules Fordham\", as a backing singer for Mari Wilson, 5TA and Kim Wilde, before signing a recording contract of her own later that decade. Fordham is now based in California.\n\nIn 1988, Fordham released her first album on Circa Records, simply titled \"Julia Fordham\". After a round of publicity including an appearance on the BBC1 \"Wogan\" chat show in April 1988, it reached No. 20 in the UK Albums Chart and eventually earned a platinum disc. The album contains the Top 40 single \"Happy Ever After\" (which peaked at No. 27 in August 1988). The album also charted in the US, reaching No. 118 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart.\n\nFordham released her second album, \"Porcelain\", in 1989. The album charted higher than her debut (No. 13) and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. It was Fordham's only album to chart on the US Top 100, reaching No. 74.\n\nIn late 1991, Fordham released her third album, \"Swept\". The album reached No. 33 in the UK and contained the Top 40 hit \"(Love Moves In) Mysterious Ways\", which peaked at No. 19 in early 1992 and was also featured in the 1991 film \"The Butcher's Wife\".\n\nFordham's first three records \"Julia Fordham\", \"Porcelain\" and \"Swept\" all went Gold in Japan. The single \"Happy Ever After\" from the first record was No. 1 in Japan.\n\nFordham's fourth album, \"Falling Forward\", was released in 1994. The album peaked at No. 21 in the UK. A single, \"Different Time, Different Place\", narrowly missed the UK Top 40 (No. 41). In 1997, Fordham released her fifth album, \"East West\". 1998's \"The Julia Fordham Collection\" recapped the best-known songs from these five albums and included new versions of recordings, including \"Where Does The Time Go\" which featured the vocals of Curtis Stigers.\n\nSigned in 1999 to Division One/Atlantic Records, Fordham recorded \"Concrete Love\". The album was produced by Larry Klein who has worked with many artists including Joni Mitchell (his former wife) and with Fordham previously on \"Falling Forward\". The release was cancelled when a corporate reshuffle caused her record label to be closed and her contract ended. The album eventually emerged on Vanguard Records and various other labels internationally, including Sanctuary Records in the UK. It now featured a re-recording of its title track as a duet with India Arie, as well as different cover artwork. Remixes of the single \"Wake Up With You\" were also released. Fordham embarked on an acoustic club tour in the US, the UK and Japan.\n\nFordham's seventh album, \"That's Life\", was released on her 42nd birthday in 2004. She performed more live shows which included a successful run of shows in Japan at the Blue Note venues. \"That's Live\", a live album and DVD (filmed in Los Angeles with guest appearances by the Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter India Arie, the trumpeter Mark Isham and Judith Owen), was released in January 2005. Fordham then came to the end of her recording contract with Vanguard. Also in 2005, her sister, Claire Fordham, had a book published, \"Plus One: A Year in the Life of a Hollywood Nobody\", based on her experiences of being Fordham's sister and living in Los Angeles.\n\nFordham continued to record, independently releasing a remake of her debut single \"Happy Ever After\" (with the help of a children's choir from a village near her hometown on the south coast of England) in aid of Indian Ocean Tsunami relief. This was backed by two tracks written and recorded with Aadesh Shrivastava. The single was then released to download and made available to purchase on CD. The proceeds from the sales of the record helped to rebuild a school in Cuddalore, India. The recording in West Sussex, UK brought Fordham back full circle to where she first started writing and performing songs in local folk clubs as a teenager.\n\nIn 2006, Fordham released an EP entitled \"Baby Love\", via AWAL (Artists Without A Label). The EP is a collection of songs inspired by the birth of her daughter Marley Rose. Also in 2006, Fordham appeared in a music video for the Judith Owen track \"Here\", playing the part of Owen's mother. The video was directed by the actress Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nIn 2007, Fordham appeared as guest vocalist on a track, \"Carry\", on Judith Owen's album \"Happy This Way\". Fordham is friends with Owen and they have performed together and been a guest on stage at each other's shows.\n\nIn September 2007, EMI released the compilation album \"Songbook\". It was a Philippines-only release and included previous studio recordings as well as live cuts and rare tracks. In November 2007, it was announced that Fordham had completed a new album which was going to be released via a \"start up\" company called NovaTunes. \"China Blue\" was released as a download-only album in late January 2008. It is a jazz-based album of self-penned songs with the exception of one track (\"I Keep Forgettin'\") which is a cover of a Leiber and Stoller song and features the original singer, Michael McDonald, on vocals.\n\nIn 2010, Fordham teamed up with comedian, actor and pianist Paul Reiser and released the album \"Unusual Suspects\". The two embarked on an acoustic tour after its release.\n\nIn late 2011, Fordham released three new tracks for download, \"You Left Me for Dead\", \"Red Silk Dress\" (collaborations with guitarist Dominic Miller) and the seasonal track \"Christmas in London\".\n\nFordham's second album, 1989's \"Porcelain\", and its 1991 follow-up, \"Swept\", were both reissued by Cherry Red Records as two-CD deluxe editions in 2013. In 2016, Cherry Red Records released a two-CD deluxe version of \"Julia Fordham\". All re-releases contain unreleased versions, B-sides, rarities and annotations written by her.\n\nIn mid-2013, Fordham was scheduled to do 15 concerts across the UK. The tour began in Worcester on 20 June and ended in her hometown of Portsmouth on 13 July. During the tour, Fordham was joined on stage by Judith Owen and they performed a duet written by Owen titled \"That Scares Me\" from Owen's album \"The Beautiful Damage Collection\". Owen also performed one of her own songs and provided the on stage harmonies and backing vocals when Fordham sang her chart hit \"Happy Ever After\" (UK No. 27).\nFordham has also teamed up again with Grant Mitchell and recorded an album containing her biggest hits and fan favourites. Scheduled for a worldwide download-only release on 24 June and physical release on 8 July in the UK, \"Under the Rainbow\" also features a new song titled \"Skipping Under the Rainbow\".\n\n\"Skipping Under the Rainbow\" was played by Michael Ball (singer) on his Sunday night radio show on BBC Radio 2 on 30 June 2013. On 4 July 2013, Ball joined Fordham on stage at Bush Hall in London and they performed a duet of Fordham's hit \"Where Does the Time Go?\" (UK No. 41).\n\nFordham was a guest on the \"Richard Madeley on Sunday\" show which aired on BBC Radio 2 on 7 July 2013. She performed two songs live for the show, including her single \"Skipping Under the Rainbow\", with Grant Mitchell accompanying on piano.\n\nShortly after finishing her UK tour, Fordham released an emotive tribute to Nelson Mandela in the form of a video set to Fordham's hit \"Happy Ever After\" (UK No. 27). This is the single that was inspired by Mandela's struggle through the apartheid years, his imprisonment and presidential years.\n\nAfter spending the summer of 2014 in the studio recording tracks for a new album, she headed to the UK for a short tour, which opened in Cornwall at St Austell Arts Centre, taking in Bury St Edmunds, Glasgow, Selby and Stockton-on-Tees.\n\nIn November 2014, Fordham returned to the U.K. to celebrate the 25th anniversary of her album \"Porcelain\". She performed the album in its entirety, accompanied by her long-time pianist and album producer Grant Mitchell. The Porcelain 25 tour included shows at Cadogan Hall, London, The Sage in Gateshead, and the Epstein Theatre Liverpool, before closing at the Tivoli Theatre in Wimborne. Shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Tokyo and Osaka in Japan followed.\n\nOn 22 October JVC Japan issued her \"The Language Of Love\" album - a collection of cover versions given Fordham's sultry, jazzy treatment. \"Moon River\" from \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\", Blondie's \"Call Me\", Eurythmics' \"Who's That Girl\", and Janis Ian's \"Seventeen\" proved particularly popular with fans. The album also included two new compositions (\"Like You Used to Do\" and \"The Morning After\") plus another re-working of \"Happy Ever After\".\n\n2015 opened in Japan with concerts in Tokyo and Osaka to promote the JVC Japan release of her \"Language of Love\" album.\n\nAfter appearing at the Malibu Guitar Festival in May, summer concerts in San Francisco (Feinsteins at the Nikko), Los Angeles (Catalina Jazz Club) and New York (Joe's Pub), Fordham, with Grant Mitchell on piano and backing vocals, returned to the UK for a trio of dates.\n\nA show on 1 August at The Pheasantry in London was followed by one at St James' Studio 24 hours later.

Wintle, (30 September 1897 – 11 May 1966) was a British military officer in the 1st The Royal Dragoons who served in the First and Second World Wars. He was the first non-lawyer to achieve a unanimous verdict in his favour in the House of Lords, and is considered one of London's greatest eccentrics.\n\nThe son of John Edward Wintle, a diplomat, by his wife Emma Teresa (née King), Alfred Daniel Wintle was born in Mariupol, East Ukraine. In 1901, the family went to live in Dunkirk; he was subsequently educated in France and Germany, becoming fluent in French and German.\n\nAt the outbreak of war, 16-year-old Wintle was in Dunkirk and claimed to have \"irregularly attached\" himself to Commander Samson's armoured-car unit, witnessing Uhlans being shot on one occasion in Belgium.\n\nWintle wished to see military action. In summer 1915, his father agreed to his son’s early entry into the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, from which he was commissioned in less than four months. Less than a week later, he was at the front. On his first night a shell burst near him, splashing over him the entrails of his sergeant (to whom he had just been introduced). Wintle later admitted to being petrified. As the bombardment continued, he dealt with his fear by standing at attention and saluting. As he later wrote, \"Within thirty seconds I was able to become again an Englishman of action and to carry out calmly the duties I had been trained to perform\".\n\nThe incident was typical, both of a series of remarkable escapes and his pride at being an Englishman (as opposed to being born \"a chimpanzee or a flea, or a Frenchman or a German\"). He saw action at Ypres, the Somme, La Bassée and Festubert, supposedly capturing the village of Vesle single-handedly before handing it over to the New Zealanders (who were about to attack it in force). His luck ran out during Third Battle of Ypres in 1917 as he helped manhandle an 18-pounder field gun across a \"crater-swamp\". The gun-carriage wheel hit an unexploded shell; he woke up in a field hospital without his left eye, one kneecap and several fingers. At age 19, Wintle's right eye was so damaged that he had to wear a monocle for the rest of his life.\n\nHe was sent back to England to convalesce by the \"infernal quacks\"; it appeared that his war was over but Wintle had other ideas. He was soon planning his escape from the Southern General Hospital back to the front, attending a nurses-only dance in their billets (disguised as a nurse) before finally making his escape. He recorded that his monocle was a dead give-away and the particularly unpleasant matron was unimpressed with his antics.\n\nWintle entrained for France with a warrant signed by a friend of his father's; he had a \"moderately successful year of action\" with the 119th Battery, 22nd Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (RFA). His Military Cross was gazetted in the \"London Gazette\" of 2 April 1919, and the citation was published on 10 December. According to his obituary, he received his MC in the mail the same day it was announced in the \"London Gazette\". The citation read:\nFor marked gallantry and initiative on 4th Nov. 1918 near Jolimentz. He went forward with the infantry to obtain information and personally accounted for 35 prisoners. On 9th Nov. he took forward his section well in front of the infantry and throughout the day he showed initiative of a very high order and did excellent work.\nWintle later recalled that he could not remember anything about either incident. He is said to have regarded the period between the First and Second World War as \"intensely boring\".\n\nWhen World War II began in September 1939, Wintle tried everything to persuade his superiors to allow him to go to France. When they refused, he planned to resign his commission and form his own army \"to take the war to the Hun\".\n\nIn his book \"Most Secret War\", Reginald Victor Jones recalls encountering Wintle on matters of air intelligence. He was impressed by an army officer with enough technical knowledge to distinguish a spectroscope from a spectrograph, and who noted details in intelligence reports which might have indicated their authenticity (or otherwise). After chatting with Wintle on Horse Guards Parade one morning, he recorded that he was surprised to see a news headline a few days later: \"Cavalry Officer in the Tower\".\n\nAfter the French surrender, Wintle demanded an aircraft (with which he intended to rally the French Air Force to fly their planes to Britain and continue fighting Germany from British air bases); when refused, he threatened an RAF officer (Air Commodore A.R. Boyle) with a gun. It was alleged that he had threatened to shoot himself and Boyle, and for this he was imprisoned in the Tower of London. On the way to his prison, the lieutenant colonel was escorted by a young soldier via train. The soldier is reported to have lost the arrest warrant; disgusted by this, Wintle declared the man incompetent, told him to wait where he was and went to get a new warrant. Since there was no other officer of higher rank at the warrant office, he signed the paper himself. Of his time in the Tower, he wrote:\nMy life in the Tower had begun. How different it was from what I had expected. Officers at first cut me dead, thinking that I was some kind of traitor; but when news of my doings leaked out they could not do enough for me. My cell became the most popular meeting place in the garrison and I was as well cared for as if I had been at the Ritz. I would have a stroll in the (dry) moat after breakfast for exercise. Then sharp at eleven Guardsman McKie, detailed as my servant, would arrive from the officers' mess with a large whisky and ginger ale. He would find me already spick and span, for though I have a great regard for the Guards, they have not the gift to look after a cavalry officer's equipment. The morning would pass pleasantly. By noon visitors would begin to arrive. One or two always stayed to lunch. They always brought something with them. I remember one particularly succulent duck in aspic - it gave me indigestion - and a fine box of cigars brought by my family doctor. Tea time was elastic and informal. Visitors dropped in at intervals, usually bringing along bottles which were uncorked on the spot. I don't recall that any of them contained any tea. Dinner, on the other hand, was strictly formal. I dined sharp at eight and entertained only such guests as had been invited beforehand. After a few days of settling in, I was surprised to find that - as a way of life- being a prisoner in the Tower of London had its points.\nWhen his case was heard, Wintle was read the three charges against him. The first was that he had feigned defective eyesight (and infirmity, to avoid active duty). This charge was dismissed after Wintle's defence provided medical evidence.\n\nThe second charge was assaulting Air Commodore Boyle, and the third was conduct contrary to (and to the prejudice of) good order and military discipline. To the latter was added the claim that he had drawn a gun in the presence of the RAF officer, and stated that \"people like you ought to be shot\". Jones recalled that far from denying this, Wintle admitted the act and produced a list of people whom he felt should likewise be shot as a patriotic gesture. The list must have been a topical one; after he had read out the sixth name upon it (Hore-Belisha, then Secretary of State for War), that charge was also dropped. The government, embarrassed by his accusations, upheld the court decision to drop all charges bar one: the assault on Air Commodore Boyle (for which Wintle received a formal reprimand). Jones went on to add that Wintle was in the relatively safe position of being tried by an Army court on charges brought by the RAF.\n\nWintle was then sent abroad to rejoin his old regiment (1st The Royal Dragoons), and went into action gathering intelligence and coordinating raids on the Vichy French in Syria. After the Allied victory in Syria, Wintle was asked to go to Vichy France in disguise to determine the condition of British prisoners-of-war held there. While waiting to make contact with sympathetic elements of the Vichy French government Wintle was betrayed, arrested as a spy and imprisoned by Vichy.\n\nDuring his captivity, he informed his guards that it was his duty as an English officer to escape; he successfully did so once by quickly unhinging his cell door and hiding in a sentry box before slipping out quietly, but was betrayed and recaptured within a week. Wintle's guard was doubled from this point on. He responded by going on a 13-day hunger strike in protest against the \"slovenly appearance of the guards who are not fit to guard an English officer!\" He also informed anyone who would listen (including Maurice Molia, the camp commandant) exactly how he felt about their cowardice and treachery to their country. He informed them that he still intended to escape, and that anyone who called himself a Frenchman would come with him. Shortly after, he sawed through the iron bars of his cell, hid in a garbage cart, and slipped over the wall of the castle, making his way back to Britain via Spain. Molia later claimed on Wintle's \"This Is Your Life\" programme in 1959 that shortly after the escape, \"because of Wintle's dauntless determination to maintain English standards and his constant challenge to our authority\" the entire garrison of 280 men had gone over to the Resistance.\n\nWintle had married his wife, Dora, in 1944. After the war, he stood as a Liberal Party candidate for the 1945 General Election at Norwood. The seat had little in terms of a Liberal voting tradition, and he finished third with about 11 percent of the vote.\n\nHe was once so furious about the lack of first-class carriages on a train that he commandeered the engine and refused to move until more carriages appeared. Wintle made legal history when he brought a legal action against a dishonest solicitor named Nye, whom he accused of appropriating £44,000 from the estate of Wintle's deceased cousin, by inveigling her into leaving the residue of her estate to Nye in her will. To publicise the case, in 1955 Wintle served time in prison after forcing Nye to remove his trousers and submit to being photographed. He pursued Nye through the courts over the next three years, losing his case on two occasions. By 1958, Wintle ran out of money and had to present the case himself. On 26 November 1958 the Lords announced that they had found for Wintle, the reasons for judgment being reserved. In its subsequent written reasons, the House of Lords held that the burden was on the solicitor Nye to establish that the gift of the residue of the deceased cousin's estate to the solicitor in the will that he had drawn was not the result of his fraud, and that he had failed to discharge this exceptionally heavy burden so that the trial jury's validation of the gift to Nye could not be allowed to stand. Wintle thus became the first non-lawyer to achieve a unanimous verdict in his favour in the House of Lords.\n\nA comprehensive analysis of the legal issues in the \"Wintle v Nye\" lawsuit is provided by Kerridge in \"Wills made in Suspicious Circumstances: the Problem of the Vulnerable Testator\". The author provides a brief overview of the factual background to the case and a discussion of the procedural difficulties faced by Wintle in prosecuting the civil case. The author suggests the ultimate victory by Wintle was the \"right result by the wrong route\", because at the time of the appeal to the House of Lords \"everyone was mindful of the newspaper headlines\"; he suggests that the Law Lords were forced to resort to sophistry to uphold Wintle's appeal, and concludes that it \"is a case which has haunted this branch of the law for a generation\". Nevertheless, it could also be said that the House of Lords decision is consistent with long standing principles and authority that a person in a fiduciary position such as a solicitor should not be permitted to benefit from abusing that relationship, particularly in the case of an elderly client 'unversed in business' like the testator in this case. Although Wintle lost his case on the first appeal, Lord Justice Sellers (one of the three judges on the Court of Appeal) dissented and considered that he should have won it. Thus, of the nine judges who heard the case at its various stages, six sided with Wintle.\n\nThe editor of \"The Times\" preserved a letter that Wintle sent him in 1946:\n\nWintle died in May 1966 aged 68 at his home in Wrotham and was cremated at Maidstone Crematorium, although he had wanted a funeral at Canterbury Cathedral with a full church service and the 1st The Royal Dragoons on parade playing \"My Old Tarpaulin Jacket\":\n\nAn encounter with Wintle in the El Vino wine bar on Fleet Street is related in a letter to the editor of the \"Spectator\" published 8 May 1999. The heading was \"Bower’s bans\" (Letters to the Editor, The Spectator, 8 May 1999):\n\n<poem>From Mr Tom Pocock\n\nSir:\nFrank Bower was not always able to eject unwanted patrons from El Vino (Letters, 1 May). One morning in the late Fifties, a West Indian workman entered what he thought was a pub and asked the proprietor for a pint of bitter. Empurpled with rage, embroidered waistcoat at bursting point, Bower was hustling him into Fleet Street when interrupted by a crisp military command from the back of the bar: 'That gentleman is a friend of mine. I have been expecting him. Kindly show him to my table.' Colonel Wintle - celebrated for inspecting the turn out of his German guards when a prisoner of war and for debagging a solicitor - had spoken.\n\nRising to greet his guest, Wintle trained his monocle on Bower and ordered, 'Pray bring us two small glasses of white wine.' When this had been drunk and a convivial conversation concluded, the Colonel and his new friend rose, shook hands and went their separate ways.\nTom Pocock\n22 Lawrence Street, London SW3</poem>\n\nHe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at London's Hay's Wharf.\n\nWintle began writing in 1924 after he broke his leg while horseback riding. In a March 1962 interview on the BBC, Wintle stated, \"I did not fall off my horse as a dentist might. A horse fell on top of me and broke my leg.\" Wintle initially wrote fiction under the nom de plume \"Michael Cobb\" stating, \"For a cavalry officer, to be literate, let alone write, is a disgrace.\" The Michael Cobb novel \"The Emancipation of Ambrose\" (1928) was filmed in 1936 as \"Wolf's Clothing\". Other works, published as A.D. Wintle, include the fictional biography \"Aesop\" (1943), the novel \"Ilium: A Story of Troy\" (1944), and \"The Club\" (1961).\n\n\nA brief biography can be found in the Spring 1989 \"Victorian Bar News\". A full-length autobiography, compiled after his death by his friend Alastair Revie from more than a million words left by Wintle, was published in 1968 by Michael Joseph as \"The Last Englishman\". Another short biography of Wintle can be found in chapter 13 (\"Colonel 'Debag' rides again\", pp 143–153) of Robert Littell's \"It takes all kinds\" published by Reynal & Co, New York, 1961. J.D. Casswell, KC represented Wintle at his World War II court-martial and devotes pages 152–159 to Wintle in his 1961 autobiography, \"A Lance For Liberty\".\n\n\n"}

Using one or more alloys of indium gallium nitride (InGaN), an optical match to the solar spectrum can be achieved. The bandgap of InN allows a wavelengths as long as 1900 nm to be utilized. However, there are many difficulties to be overcome if such solar cells are to become a commercial reality: p-type doping of InN and indium-rich InGaN is one of the biggest challenges. Heteroepitaxial growth of InN with other nitrides (GaN, AlN) has proved to be difficult.\n\nThin layers of InN can be grown using metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD).\n\nThin polycrystalline films of indium nitride can be highly conductive and even superconductive at liquid helium temperatures. The superconducting transition temperature T depends on each samples film structure and carrier density and varies from 0 K to about 3 K. With magnesium doping the T can be 3.97 K. The superconductivity persists under high magnetic field (few teslas) that differs from superconductivity in In metal which is quenched by fields of only 0.03 tesla. Nevertheless, the superconductivity is attributed to metallic indium chains or nanoclusters, where the small size increases the critical magnetic field according to the Ginzburg–Landau theory.\n\n"}

He is the current manager of Grêmio.\n\nBorn in Guaporé, Rio Grande do Sul, Renato started his career in Esportivo in Bento Gonçalves where he grew up. He was later signed with Grêmio, where in 1983 he won the Copa Libertadores, beating Peñarol of Uruguay, and the Intercontinental Cup, beating Hamburger SV of Germany, and scoring twice.\n\nIn 1987, he moved to Flamengo and won the Green Module of Brasileirão Série A in the same year. Then in 1988 Renato moved abroad, signing with Roma. However, he failed to settle in Italy and returned to Flamengo after only one disappointing season, in time to win one more trophy, the Copa do Brasil in 1990.\n\nRenato's career in Fluminense is generally associated to his belly goal in the Campeonato Carioca of 1995, against Flamengo, in the year when Flamengo celebrated 100 years. With his goal he was crowned the King of Rio in that year. In the same year, he led Fluminense to the semi-finals of the Brasileirão Série A.\n\nRenato Gaúcho appeared 41 times for the Brazilian national team, scoring five goals.\n\nIn 1986, while preparing for the FIFA World Cup Finals in Mexico, Renato was dropped from the squad by coach Telê Santana for disciplinary reasons, primarily partying late and missing training. As a result, his teammate and close friend Leandro also withdrew from the squad on the eve of Brazil's departure for Mexico. Leandro's replacement at right-back was Edson, who was injured in the second World Cup match and was then replaced by the relatively unknown Josimar of Botafogo, who became one of the stars of the tournament.\n\nHe has been working as a coach since 2000. He was Madureira's coach in 2000 and 2001. Between September 2, 2002 and July 11, 2003, and between October 1, 2003 and December 28, 2003, he was coach of Fluminense. From July 2005 to April 2007 he was Vasco da Gama's coach.\n\nIn April 2007, he returned to Fluminense as a manager. On 6 June 2007 he won the Brazilian Cup with Fluminense, his first trophy as a manager. However, he failed to win the Copa Libertadores as Fluminense were defeated in a penalty shootout to underdogs LDU from Ecuador in the final.\nOn 10 August 2008 Renato was sacked as manager of Fluminense Football Club. His sacking followed a 2–1 defeat to the Brasileirão's bottom side, Ipatinga which left them joint-bottom of the table. On 18 September 2008, he was hired as Vasco's manager. \nFluminense reappointed Renato Gaúcho on 21 July 2009 to replace Carlos Alberto Parreira, who was sacked in July 2009. Renato returned for a third stint, having already coached Fluminense twice before (in 2002–2003 and again in 2007–2008). On 1 September 2009 Fluminense dismissed him following a series of poor results.\n\nBeing the first choice of the sponsor, who intervened with the presidency, Renato was chosen again as coach of Fluminense, for a fifth spell at the club from Laranjeiras.\n\nBahia chairman Marcelo Guimarães has hired on December 13, 2009 the former Fluminense coach to replace Paulo Bonamigo, for the 2010 season.\n\nOn August 10, 2010 Grêmio confirmed Renato was their new coach, two days after the sacking of their former coach Silas. He tried to start a good season, but in his debut the team lost to Goiás and was eliminated from the 2010 Copa Sudamericana on the Second Stage. In the 2010 Brazilian League Grêmio ended in 4th place and consequently qualified to 2011 Copa Libertadores. Afterward, Renato did not do a great season in 2011. His team lost the 2011 Campeonato Gaúcho finals to their rival Internacional and was the runner-up. Grêmio was also eliminated from the 2011 Copa Libertadores on the Round of 16, losing to Chilean club Universidad Católica. All of that disappointed himself and Grêmio's President Paulo Odone. He coached some matches of the 2011 Brazilian League, however their performance wasn't good, and Renato resigned on June 30.\n\nEven after being two years without coaching any club, Renato was the first choice of Fábio Koff, president of Grêmio, to succeed Vanderlei Luxemburgo as the new coach of Grêmio. On July 2, 2013 the coach signed with the club and was presented to more than 5,000 supporters in Grêmio Arena.\n\nOn September 18, 2016 his third passage as commander of the \"Tricolor Gaúcho\" was announced, replacing Roger Machado. In the same year, he led the Porto Alegre-based team to their fifth Copa do Brasil trophy.\n\nThe following year, Portaluppi became the first Brazilian to win the Copa Libertadores as a player and as a manager, with Grêmio beating Buenos Aires side Lanús in the final.\n\nIn the 2018 season, he helped his team to win the Recopa Sudamericana over Independiente and the Campeonato Gaúcho over Brasil de Pelotas, their first win since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played in his country for five different clubs, and also spent six years in Germany, namely with Bayern Munich; additionally, he was part of the Brazilian team that won the 1994 World Cup.\n\nBorn in Rio de Janeiro, Jorginho started playing professionally for local side América Football Club, moving after just one season to Clube de Regatas do Flamengo.\n\nIn 1989, he went overseas, joining German Bundesliga outfit Bayer 04 Leverkusen. With most teams in the country playing in a 5–3–2 or 3–5–2 formation, his tremendous offensive ability was put to good use, and he scored five goals for Bayer during his third and final season.\n\nStaying in the country, Jorginho signed with league giants FC Bayern Munich in 1992–93, backed by a defensive line which included Olaf Thon, Thomas Helmer and later Lothar Matthäus. He won the national title in his second year but, after the loan return of Markus Babbel, a central defender which also operated on the right flank, was restricted to just ten league contests in 1994–95.\n\nAfter still appearing with success for J. League's Kashima Antlers, winning both the league and MVP titles in 1996, Jorginho returned to Brazil and played until 39, with São Paulo FC, CR Vasco da Gama and Fluminense Football Club.

Jorginho was booked in the second-round match against the United States, but was named in the All-Star squad a few days later. He contributed two assists in the tournament, including a cross in the semifinals against Sweden that helped Romário score the winning goal. He also performed solidly against Italy in the final, including a play in which he freed himself from a double-team. However, he got injured after just twenty minutes of play, and was replaced by Cafú.\n\nIn 2006, Jorginho was hired as the head coach of first side América. However, on 31 July of that same year, he was hired as Brazil's assistant, joining the staff of former national side teammate Dunga. In two 2008 friendlies, he took over for the head manager, following Dunga's dismissal in the previous game and subsequent ban from the Brazilian Football Confederation; he led the team to two 1–0 wins, against the Republic of Ireland and Sweden. Both left the national team following the 2010 World Cup quarterfinal loss against Holland.\n\nInternationally, Jorginho also helped the Olympic team win silver at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.\n\nJorginho started his managerial career with his first club America in 2005. In the following year, he was appointed Dunga's assistant at the Brazil national team, remaining with the role until 2010.\n\nOn 30 August 2010, Jorginho was announced as the new Goiás manager. Dismissed on 8 November, he was appointed manager of Figueirense the following 1 March.\n\nOn 21 December 2011, Jorginho left \"Figueira\" and was named at the helm of Kashima Antlers, a club he already represented as a player.

He was the second child of Edmund Sheppard, an Englishman who had gone to Australia in 1859, and his wife Mary Grace Murray; the couple had married in 1860. Edmund Sheppard was a lawyer and became a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. When he was about ten William was sent to Brisbane Grammar School. However he stayed for only one term for the headmaster believed that the school could not do justice to such a brilliant pupil and that he had better go to school in England.\n\nIn England Sheppard went to Charterhouse School where he had a very successful academic career and was finally head of the school. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge as a Foundation Scholar. When he graduated in 1884 it was as the Senior Wrangler (the mathematics student with the highest mark). This was a great prize and the Senior Wrangler was somebody. Shortly after the results came out, a letter found him, addressed only to \"The Senior Wrangler, Cambridge.\" The third wrangler was William Bragg and the fourth was W. H. Young. All the top wranglers that year were coached by E. J. Routh.\n\nAfter some years preparing to become a barrister and doing legal work, Sheppard joined the Education Department as a Junior Examiner in 1896. By 1914 he had been made an Assistant Secretary at the Board of Education. Sheppard had an extraordinary capacity for work; he would get up at 5 or 6 in the morning and work until 10 or 11 in the evening. He retired in 1921 at the age of 58. To save money, the government had asked all civil servants who would be retiring in the next few years to retire immediately; this was part of the Geddes Axe. Sheppard could not afford to retire and so he took on work as an examiner for the Cambridge School Certificate and the University of London. This was a great burden because he was amazingly thorough, recording all the errors that were made and the marks given to ensure consistency of marking across thousands of scripts.\n\nSheppard had a parallel and equally distinguished career as a mathematician, distinguished enough for him to receive the degree of Sc. D. from Cambridge in 1908 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1932. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, George James Lidstone, Alexander Aitken and William Ogilvy Kermack.\n\nSheppard was not unique in combining a civil service career with mathematical research; an almost exact contemporary was Thomas Little Heath, the historian of Greek mathematics, who went higher in the Civil Service and became much better known as an author. Another contemporary was the civil servant and statistician R H Hooker. Sheppard published his first paper in 1888 and then he published nothing during his legal years. Then he resumed publishing in 1897 and kept going until 1931.\n\nSheppard was encouraged to turn his mathematical skills to statistics by Francis Galton, whom he had met during his Cambridge days when he visited Galton's Anthropometric Laboratory. In his memorial piece Aitken placed Sheppard with Edgeworth, Pearson and Yule as a contributor to the development of statistics at the turn of the 20th. century. The assessment was based on the series of papers on correlation and the calculation of moments that Sheppard produced between 1897 and 1907. The first Sheppard's correction paper was in 1897. After 1907 the focus of Sheppard's work moved from statistics to interpolation and graduation and he published in mathematical and actuarial journals. The characteristics of Sheppard's work that Aitken emphasised were \"thoroughness and independence.\" \"Agility, shafts of brilliance, these are not to be found; but there is not a trace of the superficiality which sometimes goes with these qualities.\" At the fifth International Congress of Mathematicians held in 1912 in Cambridge, Sampson presented a paper entitled \"Reduction of errors by means of negligible differences\".\n\nWhen Sheppard died he was remembered in the Mathematical Gazette with a one-page note; Sheppard had been president of the Mathematical Association in 1928. The Annals of Eugenics published a long family memoir by Sheppard's son and an account of Sheppard's scientific work by Aitken. (These pieces form the basis of the present article.) The editor of the journal, Ronald Fisher, also contributed a piece. Fisher knew Sheppard through his work on mathematical tables. Of Sheppard's work, Fisher wrote, \"We find practically nothing that ought to be retracted, and very little that is now obsolete.\" However, it is clear from Fisher's article and from the notes he added to Aitken's that Sheppard's main virtue was that he was not Karl Pearson. Pearson had died some months previously and this appreciation of Sheppard's life is uncomfortably like a disappreciation of Pearson's.\n\nIn 1902 he married Elsa Stevens.\n\n\nA bibliography appears with the obituaries in the \"Annals of Eugenics\". It contains 40 publications, the first in 1888 and the last in 1931.\n\n\nIn 1926 Sheppard sent Karl Pearson the letters he had had from Galton and Pearson used them in his Life of Francis Galton, Vol 3b. See\nSome correspondence between Sheppard and Fisher and between Sheppard's son and Fisher is available on the web from the University of Adelaide\nAlso available are the letters that passed between Fisher and Aitken in May/June 1937.\n"}

It possibly originated as a drovers' road along which cattle were walked from Hertfordshire to London. Its origins may date back as far as the Roman period. \n\nGreen Lanes runs from Newington Green north along the western edge of Stoke Newington, thereby forming the border between Hackney and Islington, until it reaches Manor House at the eastern edge of Finsbury Park. Entering the London Borough of Haringey, it then runs 1.4 miles (2.25 km) through the neighbourhood of Harringay. From the junction with Turnpike Lane the road temporarily changes its name and runs for 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through Wood Green as 'High Road', resuming its Green Lanes identity again after the junction with Lascott's Road.

It was established on April 1, 1973, as a result of the acquisition of the Sacramento Transit Authority. In addition to operating over 60 bus routes with connecting bus service in the Sacramento area covering , RT also operates a large light rail system, which ranks currently as the sixteenth busiest light rail system in the United States.\n\nIn addition to the city of Sacramento, RT serves Sacramento International Airport, much of the northern portion of Sacramento County which includes the incorporated cities of Citrus Heights and Rancho Cordova. The unincorporated areas of Sacramento County under the RT service area include Arden Arcade, Carmichael, Fair Oaks, Florin, Gold River, North Highlands, Orangevale, Rio Linda and Rosemont. The system formerly provided express bus service between Downtown Sacramento and Elk Grove until the mid-2000s when that city took over bus operations under the newly created E-tran; RT will reclaim that area in June 2019 after signing a five-year deal to oversee its service. It also provided contracted bus service to neighboring Yolo County (covering West Sacramento, Davis and Woodland); those routes and operations were later taken over by Yolobus after its formation on January 3, 1982. In both cases, e-tran and Yolobus have retained the RT assigned route numbers for their routes as they continue to service Downtown Sacramento.\n\nThe Sacramento Regional Transit District began operations on April 1, 1973, originally as a bus service, with the acquisition of the Sacramento Transit Authority. Later that year RT purchased 103 buses for the system.\n\nOver the next decade the company continued to expand bus service to the Sacramento Region while city, county and state government officials worked together to develop a light rail system. In 1987 the light rail “starter line” opened, linking the northeastern (Interstate 80) and eastern (Highway 50) corridors with Downtown Sacramento, more specifically, from Watt I/80 station to Butterfield station. Since light rail ridership increased, the company continued to expand the light rail system. With these efforts, they completed its first light rail expansion along the Highway 50 corridor in September 1998 with the opening of the Mather Field/Mills Station. On September 2003, RT opened the first phase of the South Line, a extension to South Sacramento. In June 2004, light rail was extended from the Mather Field/Mills station to Sunrise Boulevard, and on October 15, 2005, a extension from the Sunrise station to the city of Folsom was opened.\n\nIn December 2006, the final leg of the Amtrak/Folsom project was extended by , to the downtown Sacramento Valley Station, connecting light rail with Amtrak inter-city and \"Capitol Corridor\" services as well as local and commuter buses. In 2012, the first phase of the Green Line opened, which is planned to be extended to the Sacramento International Airport. In 2015, RT completed its extension of the Blue Line from Meadowview station to Consumes River College. RT currently operates 97 bus routes in a service area. \n\nRT is governed by an eleven-member Board of Directors composed of members of the Sacramento, Elk Grove, Citrus Heights, Rancho Cordova, and Folsom City Councils as well as members of the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors. Fiscal year 2006 had an operating budget is $148.54 million, with a capital budget of $15.4 million.\n\nRT employs a workforce of approximately 1,163 people, 80% of whom are dedicated to operations and maintenance of the bus and light rail systems. RT operates three maintenance and operations facilities – one for buses at 29th and N Streets, one for the Community Bus Service at McClellan Park, and one for the light rail system at 2700 Academy Way in North Sacramento.\n\nSince 2004, with the exception of some neighborhood shuttle vans (see #The Neighborhood Ride below), the bus fleet consists exclusively of Orion 07.501 (VII) and Orion VII Next Generation buses powered by compressed natural gas. In 2015 RT will add a fleet of Gillig BRT Plus CNG to the lineup to replace buses that reached its 12-year run.\n\nThe RT system operates 67 bus routes, as of 2013, with service between 5:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. daily, and ending much earlier on weekends. Frequencies range between every 15 and 80 minutes (some express buses run only a few times a day). There has been proposals in the past to expand the service hours to late nights to accommodate passengers, businesses and communities, but have been slow to implement these ideas. The most recent changes were announced in August 2012, and is gradually making plans to improve and expand bus services system-wide by 2017. Since light rail has opened, buses have generally acted as feeders to light rail routes.\n\nThe RT system originally excluded service to Sacramento International Airport, as it was operated between downtown Sacramento and the airport on an hourly basis by Yolobus. On January 5, 2020, RT introduced Express Route 142 that services the airport and downtown on a 20/30 minute interval basis, acting as a supplementary service to Yolobus’ route 42, which will continue to operate a local schedule.\n\nThe numbers provided are average weekday boardings.\n\nThe Sacramento RT Light Rail system is a system, consisting of three rail lines, 54 stations, and 76 vehicles. Service operates daily from 4:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. 4:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.\n\nSacramento's light rail system, with an average of 48,400 weekday daily boardings in Q1 2013, is the eleventh busiest in the United States.\n\nThe creation and maintenance of the light-rail system is pushed by the advocacy group \"Friends of Light Rail and Transit\".\n\nTo meet the requirements of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, the RT established a Paratransit service in 1993, which is a door-to-door service for the disabled.\n\nIn 2006, RT created a new division internally known as \"Community Bus Service\". Known to the ridership as \"The Neighborhood Ride\"\n\n\nOn April 9, 2010 at about 10:20 a.m. a Blue Line train struck a vehicle at the 47th Ave. crossing. The vehicle, a green Honda Accord was dragged about . Inside the vehicle was a woman about the age of 40, She was pronounced dead at U.C. Davis Medical Center. The cause was revealed to be the woman who drove her car around the crossing gates which were down.\n\nA man was hospitalized April 26, 2010 after he was hit by a light rail while talking on a cell phone. The crash happened near the Iron Point Station in Folsom at about 10 a.m. Investigators said the pedestrian was walking on the tracks and not paying attention to what was coming toward him. The pedestrian on the tracks never looked up at all throughout the entire incident. The operator told investigators that he had spoken to the injured person, and the guy said that he was walking on the tracks because he didn't want to be walking on the roadway while talking on his cell phone. The pedestrian was in serious condition at UC Davis Medical Center. Passengers on the train had an hour delay.\n\nDeputies were called shortly after 9 a.m. on April 27, 2010 to the Zinfandel station. Sheriff's Sgt. Tim Curran said one person shot the victim in the leg and then fled. Investigators said a fight broke out on a light rail train, culminating in a shooting once the train reached the station platform. The alleged shooter was seen running across the parking lot outside a nearby Ross store, Curran said. The victim was expected to survive, authorities said. RT service did not appear to be affected.\n\nOn November 11, 2010 a pick up truck ran into the side of a moving Regional Transit Light Rail Train at 10:15 a.m. at Starfire Drive and Folsom Boulevard in Sacramento County. The train was only scratched in the collision. Only one passenger received medical attention for minor injuries; the two people in the truck were not hurt.\n\nA Siemens light rail vehicle on a Gold Line train caught fire and started to smoke on December 23, 2010 at approximately 7:30 p.m. near the College Greens station. A communications issue between the Sacramento Fire Department and the Regional Transit light rail operator occurred when the train began to move from the station where the fire was being doused to the Watt/Manlove station over a mile away. The fire caused service disruptions to Gold Line trains traveling in both directions for up to an hour. The car (#136) was towed out of service to the Regional Transit maintenance facility on Academy Way. The fire was likely caused by an overheated generator and battery located on the bottom of the train.\n\nOn January 28, 2012 three people died after their vehicle collided with a light rail train. The accident took place at the crossing near the intersection of 25th Street and 26th Avenue just before 4:45 p.m, when black Pathfinder SUV was hit by a southbound Blue Line train. The gate arms were determined to be functioning properly. All three fatalities were occupants of the vehicle. At least 17 injured victims were taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\n\n"}

Both groups of people caused a loss of species and both altered their behaviour to a degree after realising their effect on indigenous flora and fauna.\n\nNew Zealand has thirteen national parks, thirty one marine reserves and many other protected areas for the conservation of biodiversity. The introduction of many invasive species is threatening the indigenous biodiversity, since the geographical isolation of New Zealand led to the evolution of plants and animals that did not have traits to protect against predation. New Zealand has a high proportion of endemic species, so pest control is generally regarded as a high priority.\n\nThe New Zealand Department of Conservation administers approximately 30% of New Zealand's land, along with less than 1% of the country's marine environment, for conservation and recreational purposes. It has published lists, under the New Zealand Threat Classification System, of flora and fauna that is at risk or declining, which are included in national and regional plans.\n\nThe Conservation Act 1987 is New Zealand's principal legislation concerning the conservation of indigenous biodiversity. The Act established the Department of Conservation, Fish and Game, and complements the National Parks Act 1980 and the Reserves Act 1977.\n\nThe Wildlife Act 1953 covers the protection and control of wild animals, and provides for wildlife sanctuaries, refuges and management reserves.\n\nThe black robin (\"Petroica traversi\") was saved from the brink of extinction by a conservation effort led by Don Merton of the New Zealand Wildlife Service. However all black robins that survive today are descended from a single female, therefore the species has little genetic diversity.\n\nThe two subspecies of saddleback had each been reduced to a small population on a single island: Hen Island for the North Island saddleback, and Big South Cape Island off Stewart Island for the South Island saddleback. After a programme of translocation to other predator-free island reserves, the population of the South Island saddleback has increased from 36 birds to over 1,200 birds on 15 islands. The North Island subspecies had increased from 500 birds to over 6,000 birds on 12 islands. This has taken both subspecies from critically endangered on the IUCN Red List to near threatened for the South Island saddleback and least concern for the North Island saddleback.\n\nThe brown teal (\"Anas chlorotis\") recovery program has successfully improved the population status from endangered to near threatened on the IUCN Red List.\n\nThe North Island kōkako population has increased from a low point of around 350 pairs to over 1600 pairs in 23 populations around the North Island.\n\nMost of the current 11.9 million hectares of agricultural land had been cleared, representing around 44% of the total land area of New Zealand. Initial attempts to decrease the scale of further deforestation, such as Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 that created 'forestry rights', have been argued to only be moderately successful. However, they created world class structures of data collection and property rights that made way first for an amendment to the 1949 Forests Act in 1993 and later to the Climate Change Response Act 2002. New Zealand's patterns of greenhouse gas emissions are similar to Scandinavian countries, in that land use and land use change and forestry are amongst the most significant contributors. Forestry came to be seen as main tool in meeting New Zealand's Kyoto Protocol targets. Accordingly, REDD programmes (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) were implemented, whereby reforestation and deforestation was tied carbon emissions credits and traded (ETS) and commercial carbon-sink forests were planted. Perhaps due to the government's initial control over REDD and the trade in carbon credits there was initially an increase in deforestation and it was not until private forestry owners gained access to the trading scheme and to carbon credits that the scheme started to produce reductions in deforestation.\n\nDuring the relatively short occupation of New Zealand by humans a large number of species have been made extinct due to predation by introduced species, hunting, and the loss of habitat. Many extant species are under threat because of past and ongoing human activities.\n\nOne example is the Cromwell chafer beetle (\"Prodontria lewisi\"), which is on the IUCN Red List of critically endangered species. A reserve was created in 1983 to protect its habitat. More recent examples are the Hector's and Maui's dolphins, which are under threat from the fishing industry.\n\nThe use of 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) as a pesticide is a contentious issue. 1080 is used with carrots and cereal pellets to control the common brushtail possum, an introduced animal pest.\n\nAs well as government funding for conservation efforts money also comes from numerous NGOs and private individuals. The Nature Heritage Fund and the Community Conservation Fund are both government funded.\n\nConservation organisations began to form from the 19th century. Scenery Preservation Societies formed in some of the Provinces.\n\nAn early conservation lobby group was the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand, which is now the foremost environmental organisation involved in conservation advocacy in New Zealand. In recent years numerous conservation, landcare and activist groups have formed including:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The strength of the UK press is a unique feature of the Irish print media scene, with the availability of a wide selection of British published newspapers and magazines, many of these UK editions produce specialist versions for the Irish market e.g. Irish Daily Mail and the Irish Sun. Some of the most popular national newspapers include The Irish Times, the Irish Independent and the Irish Examiner.

'Best of Times') is a 2005 Taiwanese film directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien. It consists of three separate stories of romance, set in different eras, using the same lead actors, Shu Qi and Chang Chen. In \"A Time for Love,\" set in 1966, a soldier (Chang) meets an alluring pool-hall hostess (Shu). \"A Time for Freedom,\" set in 1911, focuses on a courtesan's relationship with a freedom fighter during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. In \"A Time for Youth,\" set in 2005, a singer forsakes her female lover for a photographer with whom she's having an affair.\n\nThe film was nominated for the \"Palme d'Or\" at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, won the Golden Apricot for Best Feature Film at the 2006 Yerevan International Film Festival, and received positive reviews. In 2017 \"The New York Times\" listed it as one of the 25 best films of the 21st century. It has been praised for its topical themes of communication, romance and relationships, with each linked symbolically to the era it takes place in.\n\n(Chinese: 戀愛夢; pinyin: \"liàn ài mèng\") Set in Kaohsiung in 1966 (the year of the Cultural Revolution in mainland China and consequently a time of great freedom in Taiwan) with dialogue in Taiwanese Hokkien, the first story follows a young soldier, Chen, who is awaiting deployment to his station, and his encounter with a young woman, May, who works in a poolhall. Chen and May meet while playing pool together and often exchange glances while trying to remain discreet about their mutual attraction. As May begins to close the hall for the night, Chen promises to write to her before departing and she is flattered.\n\nThree months later, May receives a letter from Chen in which he writes that he hopes to see her soon. After working at the poolhall for a few months, she decides to return to Chiayi, where she had previously worked. \n\nOne day, while off duty, Chen gets a chance to visit the Kaohsiung poolhall only to discover that May no longer works there. He begins to follow her trail, finally tracking her down at a different pool hall in Huwei. They spend some time together before heading to the train station so that he may return to his post, but arrive too late, missing the departure. She suggests they wait for the next bus and as they stand at the stop, he takes her hand and they huddle together underneath their umbrella.\n\n(Chinese: 自由夢; pinyin: \"zì yóu mèng\") Set in Dadaocheng in 1911 (when Taiwan was occupied by the Japanese), with dialogue presented only through on-screen titles (as in a silent film), the second segment follows a singing courtesan living in a brothel who wants to be freed by becoming a concubine to Mr. Chang, a customer whose occupation as a traveling writer and political freedom fighter keeps him away for months at a time. When he visits her, he often shares stories of his travels and she sings to him (the only times we hear a voice during the segment). Despite being fond of her, he denies her the opportunity of freedom because he disagrees with the system of concubinage and is overcommitted to the political cause of fighting the Japanese through diplomacy. \n\nWhen her younger sister, Ah Mei, who also works as a courtesan, is impregnated by a customer who can't afford to buy her out, Mr. Chang decides to help buy the younger sister's freedom. After being bought, Ah Mei goes to speak with her sister and they say their farewells. \n\nOne month later, Mr. Chang returns to the brothel to visit the courtesan. She tells him that she has been asked by her Madame to remain until Ah Mei's position is replaced and hopefully glances at him. Mr. Chang doesn't respond.\n\nA few days later, the new courtesan is brought in and speaks with her. She asks her age; the girl says she is ten. After Ah Mei comes to visit, the courtesan asks Mr. Chang if he has any plans to make her his concubine. He remains silent and she begins to cry.\n\nThree months later, the courtesan listens to the new girl's singing lessons when she receives a letter from Mr. Chang. In it, he writes of a poem that reflects on the sorrow that may befall Taiwan after being liberated by its captors. After reading the poem, the courtesan wipes her tears away.\n\n(Chinese: 青春夢; pinyin: \"qīng chūn mèng\") Set in Taipei in 2005, with dialogue in Mandarin, the third segment begins with Jing, an epileptic club singer in a lesbian relationship, who has a sexual encounter with a photographer, Zhen, in his apartment and begins an affair. During one of her performances, he comes onstage to photograph her up close, prompting other photographers to follow suit, all while her girlfriend watches from the crowd. After Jing begins to interact with Zhen on stage, his girlfriend (presumably) walks out on the performance. Back at his apartment, Zhen finds Jing's badge with instructions on what to do in case of an epileptic episode. Before he goes to return it, he spots his girlfriend down the street and tries to embrace her, but she rejects his advances.\n\nLater, at a club, Jing and her girlfriend argue over Jing's failure to respond to her calls. Jing calms her down with a hug and promises to wait for her to perform. After they arrive at their apartment, Jing receives a text from Zhen to meet the following day so he can give her the photos as well as her misplaced badge. Jing's girlfriend tries to speak with her, but she remains distant. When her girlfriend leaves to bathe, Jing starts writing lyrics inspired by her experience with Zhen. \n\nThe following morning, Jing works on recording the music to the song she wrote the night before. She meets up with Zhen and asks him to take her to his place, where they continue their affair. Back at the apartment, Jing's girlfriend wakes up to find Jing absent. After finding Jing's phone left behind, she types Jing a message in which she writes that she's tired of waiting to be loved back and that she'll kill herself like Jing's previous girlfriend. \n\nJing returns home and finds the message. She reads it and lies down on the bed. The song she wrote begins to play. We see her riding with Zhen on his motorbike along the freeway.\n\n\"Three Times\" was originally meant to be an omnibus collection of short films, with Hou directing only one of the segments. But the producers were unable to obtain the financing to hire three directors, so Hou took over the whole production. Hou cast Shu Qi for the female lead roles, marking his second collaboration with her, after 2001's Millennium Mambo. For the male lead roles, Hou cast Chang Chen, adding to Chen's list of collaborations with notable Chinese and Taiwanese directors, including Edward Yang, Wong Kar Wai, Ang Lee and Jeffrey Lau. He and Shu reunited with Hou in his 2015 wuxia film \"The Assassin\".\n\nThe film's Chinese title is best translated as \"Our Best Moments\", and Hou has said the stories are somewhat inspired by his memories. He has said, \"It seems to me that by contrasting love stories from three different times, we can feel how people's behavior is circumscribed by the times and places they live in. [...] I'm pushing sixty, and these things have been hanging around for so long it seems like they're part of me. Maybe the only way I can discharge my debt to them is to film them.\"\n\nDiscussing \"Three Times\" in an interview for Artificial Eye’s UK DVD edition, Hou said:\n\n\"I feel that every era has its own distinctive sense. These eras will never come again. Time keeps moving forward. One’s environment and one’s thoughts keep changing as well. They’ll never come again. It’s not that they’re good times, it’s because we’re recalling them that we call them good times.\"\n\nIt has been reported that there was not enough time for the actors to learn their dialogue for the second segment, so Hou chose to use inter-titles instead.\n\n\"Three Times\" received generally positive reviews when it was released in North America. It holds an 86% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Most critics agreed that the opening segment, \"A Time for Love\" (which is often likened to the works of Wong Kar-Wai), was the most successful, and that the final segment, \"A Time for Youth\" (which was compared to Hou's 2001 film \"Millennium Mambo\") was the least, but it was still praised. Response to the second segment, \"A Time for Freedom\", was in between, with many critics comparing it to Hou's 1997 film \"Flowers of Shanghai\".\n\nRoger Ebert, who championed the film at Cannes, gave it four stars out of four in his review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\":\"Three stories about a man and a woman, all three using the same actors. Three years: 1966, 1911, 2005. Three varieties of love: unfulfilled, mercenary, meaningless. All photographed with such visual beauty that watching the movie is like holding your breath so the butterfly won’t stir.\"\n\nKay Weissberg in \"Variety\" wrote:\"Synthesizing Hou Hsiao-hsien's ambivalent relationship with time and memory, \"Three Times\" forms a handy connecting arc between the Taiwanese helmer's earlier work and the increasingly fragmentary direction of his recent films. Best appreciated by those familiar with his slow rhythms and pessimistic take on contempo life, pic presents three stories using the same leads set in three time periods to explore love and how the present circumscribes lives.\"\n\nStephen Whitty of the \"Star-Ledger\" wrote:\"According to one American critic, \"Three Times\" is 'why cinema exists.' Only if you think that cinema has no higher calling than presenting a long series of gorgeously lit close-ups of beautiful actresses are you likely to agree.\"\n\nIndependent filmmaker Jim Jarmusch wrote: \"Hou Hsiao-hsien is not only the crowning jewel of contemporary Taiwanese cinema, but an international treasure. His films are, for me, among the most inspiring of the past thirty years, and his grace and subtlety as a filmmaker remain unrivaled. Film after film, Hou Hsiao-hsien is able to adeptly balance a historical and cultural overview with the smallest, most quiet and intimate details of individual interactions. His narratives can appear offhand and non-dramatic, and yet the structures of the films themselves are all about storytelling and the beauty of its variations. And Hou's camera placement is never less than exquisite. \n\nHis newest film, THREE TIMES, is also his newest masterpiece. A trilogy of three love stories, Chang Chen and Shu Qi beautifully portray Taiwanese lovers in three distinct time periods: 1966, 1911 and 2005. The first section (in 1966), just on its own, is one of the most perfect pieces of cinema I’ve ever seen. The second, set in a brothel in 1911, remarkably explores dialogue and verbal exchange by almost completely eliminating sound itself (!), while the final piece leaves us in present-day Taipei—a city of rapidly changing social and physical landscapes where technology has a harsh effect on delicate interpersonal communication. The resonance of these combined stories, their differences and similarities, their quietness and seeming simplicity, left me in a near dream-state—something that only happens to me after the most striking cinematic experiences. \nNow, for the first time, one of Hou Hsiao-hsien's films is finally being properly released (by IFC) in the U.S. And this makes me, as a true fan, very, very happy.\"\n\n\"Three Times\" was released in the United States on April 26, 2006, and was only the second of Hou's films to receive theatrical distribution in the USA (the first was \"Millennium Mambo\"). In its opening weekend on three screens, it grossed $14,197 ($4,732 per screen). Never playing at more than five theaters at any point during its theatrical run, it eventually grossed $151,922.\n\nThe film was released on a region 1 DVD in the United States by IFC Films in 2006. It is also available on digital for rent and for purchase on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1938927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938927", "title": "Phantom of the Opera (1976 musical)", "text": "Phantom of the Opera (1976 musical)\n\nPhantom of the Opera is a 1976 musical with book and lyrics by Ken Hill. It is the first musical adaptation of the 1910 novel \"The Phantom of the Opera\" by Gaston Leroux, about the hideously disfigured Phantom's amorous obsession with the magnificent, naïve singer, Christine. Hill wrote the original English lyrics to the music of Verdi, Gounod, Offenbach, Mozart, Weber, Donizetti, and Boito.\n\nHill’s \"Phantom of the Opera\" was the first musical version of the story by Gaston Leroux and has enjoyed financial success. Hill's musical inspired the award-winning Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version of the story.\n\nAs Ken Hill rummaged through a used bookstore, he picked up a copy of Gaston Leroux's \"The Phantom of the Opera\" novel and eventually produced it as a stage musical. The show started off as a production at Morecambe Pier as the first staged musical version, and then when Hill was working as Director of Productions for the Newcastle Playhouse. This first production was produced at The Duke’s Playhouse in Lancaster on 26 July 1976, where it proved to be a hit. It was directed by John Blackmore, designed by Clare Lyth, with musical direction by Gary Yershon. It differed from the later version of Ken Hill’s musical, in having a modern musical score by Ian Armit (who also worked with Hill on his production of \"The Curse of the Werewolf\") in addition to excerpts from the opera \"Faust\" by Charles Gounod.\n\nIn 1984, Hill revived his musical version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\". This time though, he wanted to add the kind of music that would have been heard at the Opéra Garnier in the late 19th century. Consequently, he discarded the modern score by Ian Armit and wrote original English lyrics that told Gaston Leroux’s tale. By placing them to opera arias by Gounod, Offenbach, Verdi, Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, and Boito, he created a musical that reflected the era in which the original novel was written. This updated version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" was produced in a joint production by the Newcastle Playhouse and the Theatre Royal Stratford East, and premiered at the Newcastle Playhouse on 3 April 1984, before shortly moving to the Theatre Royal Stratford East. In between, the show had two very brief runs at the New Tyne Theatre in Newcastle and the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton - neither of those productions did very well. When the show got the Theatre Royal Stratford East, Sarah Brightman, who created the role of Christine in the Lloyd Webber version, was famously asked to perform the role of Christine in the 1984 cast but she turned it down, leaving the role for the opera singer Christina Collier.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber, who at the time was married to Brightman, and Cameron Mackintosh attended a performance of Ken Hill’s \"Phantom of the Opera\" at the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Prompted by the good reviews, they approached Hill about the possibility of their collaborating on developing a grand scale version of his Phantom in the West End, and offered to produce it. In fact, Hill and Lloyd Webber had worked together earlier on a revival of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" at the Winchester Theatre. Lloyd Webber and his producer, Cameron Mackintosh, had been highly enthusiastic when they broached Hill about his Phantom of the Opera. But in the end, Lloyd Webber chose to pursue the musical without Hill.\n\n\"Phantom of the Opera\" then emerged on the other side of the Atlantic in 1987 for its American premiere in St. Louis at the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis. This production starred Sal Mistretta as The Phantom - his performance won him the St. Louis Theatre Critics Award. A second US production was mounted in 1988 in San Francisco at the Theatre in the Square, produced by Jonathan Reinis.\n\nThe productions of \"Phantom of the Opera\" in St. Louis and San Francisco were so successful that Hill was asked to mount a national tour of the United States. Jonathan Reinis (who later produced Ken Hill’s \"The Invisible Man\" in London) formed Phantom Touring Company Inc. who acted as the producers for the tour, along with Electric Factory Concerts. The tour began in 1989, with musical arrangements and designs by the original Newcastle Playhouse team. It performed for a few years to packed houses all over America, travelling to approximately 110 cities, and grossing a total of $72 million.\n\nIn 1991, \"Phantom of the Opera\" returned to the United Kingdom where it embarked on a national tour produced by Stewart Macpherson and then transferred to London’s West End. It opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre on 18 December 1991, with a similar cast to the 1984 production - Peter Straker was The Phantom and Christina Collier as Christine. But despite positive reviews, the West End production did poorly at the box office at the time of IRA bombings, and closed earlier than expected, on 11 April 1992. However, the production was nominated for two Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Director of a Musical, the latter of which placed Ken Hill against Simon Callow and Judi Dench. It left the West End to commence the first of several Japanese, Asian and Australasian tours all produced by Stewart Macpherson.\n\nThe story begins (\"Introduction\") with Richard, new manager of the Paris Opera House (previously president of Northern Railways and a member of the Stock Exchange Choir), greeted by the artists and staff (\"Welcome Sir, I'm So Delighted\"). The previous managers of the Paris Opera did not last very long, due to problems with the legend of the Opera Ghost, who demands 20,000 francs a month and his own private box. These requests are defied by the adamant and foolish Richard, little knowing the mayhem that will take place if he refuses to accept the Ghost's demands. Madame Giry, the box keeper, warns Richard that he may have upset the \"Ghost\". She is horrified when Richard demands use of Box Five (the Ghost's box). She knows the \"Ghost\" won't stand idly by while Richard refuses to accept his demands. She warns Richard to expect a run of horrific events.\n\nThe evening performance begins (\"Accursed All Base Pursuit of Earthly Pleasure\"). The ghost provides his first warning in the form of the murder of Mephistopheles. After the performance, Richard's handsome (if somewhat dim) son Raoul, who is madly in love with the chorus girl Christine Daae, goes to her dressing room, only to hear her speak with another man. Jealous, Raoul enters the room to find it empty. This \"ghost\" seems very real, as is his love for Christine and woe betide anyone who gets in his way (\"How Dare She\").\n\nA Groom comes to talk to Richard in his office about the disappearance of a horse named Caesar (\"Late Last Night I'm In The Cellars\"). Richard decides that the man is an idiot and promptly fires him. Raoul, feeling betrayed, meets with Christine at a local graveyard (\"All Of My Dreams Faded Suddenly\"). He is then introduced to the angelic voice of the Angel Of Music (\"While Floating High Above\"). Christine leaves and the Phantom attempts to throttle Raoul, but is disturbed by a Grave Digger, and runs off. Back at the Opera House, the unfortunate Richard has had to stand by while his son pursues the chorus girl Christine Daae, and now must convince his diva Carlotta, who feels she is too ill to perform, to sing at the performance later that evening, with the help of his staff (\"She Says She's Got The Nodules\"). An agreement is made that Christine Daae will sing the role, while Carlotta mimes the act.\n\nThis wasn't what the Phantom had in mind. He'll not cease causing \"accidents\" and will do all in his power to disrupt the proceedings, including rubbing out the lead singer. At the evening performance, Carlotta mimes the act incorrectly and very clearly out-of-sync with Christine (\"What Do I See\"). Christine faints before the end of the performance and Carlotta starts to croak like a frog, causing her to call the performance to halt. Laughing madly, the Phantom declares to the whole stage that Carlotta is bringing down the chandelier. But then, he finds the chandelier is the wrong one and switches it to a candelabra, dropping it on Carlotta.\n\nAfter the performance, Christine and Raoul meet on the rooftop of the Opera House to discuss running away from the Opera House and the Phantom together. But the Phantom isn't very far away at all. He appears from behind the statue of Apollo and towers above them (\"To Pain My Heart Selfishly Dooms Me\"). Christine and Raoul leave the roof, leaving the Phantom alone. An old man enters, throwing bird-seed down for the pigeons on the Opera House's roof. The Phantom's hurt turns to anger, and he throws the unfortunate man off the building. He screams that Christine will be his and the first act ends.\n\nA performance of Faust begins with Christine singing the lead role of Marguerite (\"Ah! Do I Hear My Lover's Voice?\"). However, during the song there's an unscheduled blackout and when the lights come back up, Christine has disappeared. The show quickly adjourns and the rest of the cast search high and low for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns into the audience (\"No Sign! I See No Sign!\"). But to no avail. The scene switches to the Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind (\"Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright\").\n\nMeanwhile, the search party above ground migrates to the boiler room and the Persian reveals his true identity, and fills us in on the Phantom's history (\"Born With A Monstrous Countenance\"). Raoul searches for a way down to the cellars below the Opera House (\"In The Shadows, Dim And Dreay\"). He succeeds and slips through a manhole with the rest of the group, into a boiler room. However things quickly heat up, literally, as the Phantom traps them inside. It looks like the end for the motley group, and they break into a chorus of (\"What An Awful Way To Perish\").\n\nThe final scene takes place in the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems determined to wed Christine and expresses his love for her (\"Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain\"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and the Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade and he turns back, with a determined and violent look in his eyes, and produces a priest and chorus girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, the Persian and the rest of the group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, the Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms (\"Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain\"). Christine remarks that the Phantom was always the angel of music (\"He Will Not Go Without A Friend\").\n\n\n\"All Of My Dreams Faded Suddenly\", sung by the character Christine, was added to the show in 1992 for the first Japanese tour, based upon an aria by Antonín Dvořák. It replaced \"Love Has Flown, Never Returning\", but not before the latter had been recorded onto the West End cast recording of \"Phantom of the Opera\". The newer song has never been recorded and released.\n\nSince 1992, \"Phantom of the Opera\" has been performed around the world, in countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Korea. The most recent production of \"Phantom\" took place in 2013 in Tokyo, Japan running from 19 December 2013 to 29 December 2013. It was produced by Stewart Macpherson who originally produced the West End production in 1991.\n\nThe official cast recording of the show was released in 1993 by D Sharp Records. It featured the entire West End cast, and includes all the songs in the show. It was also later released by two other record labels; Stetson Records (an offshoot of The Stetson Group), and BMG. The latter versions of the CD were mainly sold in Japan (in Japanese packaging), Australia and New Zealand, on national tours.\n"}

{"id": "1938932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938932", "title": "Barga", "text": "Barga\n\nBarga is a medieval town and \"comune\" of the province of Lucca in Tuscany, central Italy. It is home to around 10,000 people and is the chief town of the \"Media Valle\" (mid valley) of the Serchio River.\n\nBarga lies north of the provincial capital, Lucca. It is overlooked by the village of Albiano, a \"località\" of Barga, which in the 10th century was the site of a castle protecting the town.\n\nPania della Croce, a mountain of the Apuan Alps, dominates the surrounding chestnut trees, grape vines and olive groves.\nIn the 9th century, Barga is mentioned as a family feud of the Lombard family of Rolandinghi. In the 11th century, Barga obtained from Matilda of Tuscany broad privileges including tax exemptions. However, formally Barga was still subordinate to Lucca. When Matilda died, she left all her properties, including the Serchio Valley, to the Church, which was not really a popular decision, and caused a war. Despite the war, Barga was not looted, apparently, because of the presence of the nuncius, sent to the valley by the Pope Gregory IX. As the result of the war, the diocese of Lucca was abolished and split between several parties, including Pisa. Barga took advantage of it, and in the 13th century helped Pisa against Lucca, but in 1236 was finally subordinated to Lucca. After these events, Barga has developed as an important trade city which had connections with Modena over mountain roads. The city grew as a castle surrounded by a line of walls, of which two gates (\"Porta Reale\" and \"Porta Macchiaia\") have survived. The town was well known during the Middle Ages for the manufacture of silk threads which were exported to major centres such as Florence, its mills powered by the hydraulic power of the nearby creeks. In the Middle Ages, Lucca and Pisa battled frequently to conquer the wealthy town and the surrounding territory, and for a time Barga was part of the Florentine dominion, later Duchy and Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Between 1331 and 1859 Albiano owed its allegiance to the Florentine State. It became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Since 1923 Barga is part of the province of Lucca.\n\nThe region was part of the Gothic Line in World War II, and was the scene of fierce fighting between the Allies and Germans from October 1944 until April 1945, especially during the Battle of Garfagnana at the end of December 1944.\n\nMain sights include:\n\nBarga is named, \"The most Scottish town in Italy,\" because at the end of the 19th century a number of Italians from the town emigrated to Scotland. There were many returnees over the years and now up to 40% of present-day residents have Scottish relatives. An iconic red telephone box from the UK was gifted to the people of Barga and placed in the town centre, where it now operates as a book exchange, dubbed \"the smallest library in Tuscany\". There is an annual international opera festival, called \"Opera Barga Festival\", and a long running and very successful jazz festival, \"Bargajazz\". Recently, Barga has become the home of many painters, including John Bellany who exhibit their work in some of the small galleries within the castle walls. \nThe \"Sagra\" is a feature of Italian rural culture; communal meals for several hundred people, eaten in the open air, often in orchards, vineyards or sports grounds. Originally religious celebrations, they are now often used to raise funds for local causes. Each town and village will have its own peculiar sagra: Around Barga from July to September it is possible to participate in a Sagra every night. In Barga itself there is the \"Cena in Vignola\" in the vineyard below the Duomo, and in August the \"Sagra del pesce e Patate\" (Fish and Chips) in celebration of the Barga/Scottish connection. At nearby San Pietro in Campo, there is the \"Sagra del Maiale\" (Pork), at Filecchio the \"Sagra della Polenta e Ucelli\" (originally small wild birds, now pheasant), at Fornaci di Barga the \"1°Maggio expo\".\n\nThe Italian Touring Club has recently assigned the \"orange flag\" of the \"I Borghi più belli d'Italia\" (\"Best Villages of Italy\"), a distinguished sign recognizing the peculiarity of its beauty and of its quality. \nBarga has also been, since 1999, the home of the \"European Gnome Sanctuary\" run by the Garden Gnome Liberation Front.\n\nThe frazione of Castelvecchio Pascoli was home to one of Italy's 19th century poet Giovanni Pascoli.\n\nIn 2008 Barga became the first medieval historic centre in Italy to be mapped and equipped with QR codes (2D barcodes) for all of the churches, palazzo's statues, restaurants, bars and places of interest. After a two-year trial, the project was released to the public in Dec 2010 under the name iBarga. Visitors can now get precise up to date information about the city on their mobile telephones and in 10 different languages\n\nThe British writer Len Deighton wrote his novel \"SS-GB\" at a rented hut on the outskirts of Barga, using a manual typewriter bought in the town. One of the novel's main characters got the family name \"Barga\".\n\nIn 1991 the local sport center named \"Il Ciocco\" hosted the second edition of UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1938949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938949", "title": "High German consonant shift", "text": "High German consonant shift\n\nIn historical linguistics, the High German consonant shift or second Germanic consonant shift is a phonological development (sound change) that took place in the southern parts of the West Germanic dialect continuum in several phases. It probably began between the third and fifth centuries and was almost complete before the earliest written records in High German were produced in the eighth century. The resulting language, Old High German, can be neatly contrasted with the other continental West Germanic languages, which for the most part did not experience the shift, and with Old English, which remained completely unaffected.\n\nThe High German consonant shift altered a number of consonants in the southern German dialects – which includes Standard German, Yiddish, and Luxembourgish – and so explains why many German words have different consonants from the related words in English, Dutch and the Scandinavian languages. The term is sometimes used to refer to a core group of nine individual consonant modifications. Alternatively, it may encompass other phonological changes that took place in the same period.\nFor the core group, there are three changes, which may be thought of as three successive phases. Each phase affected three consonants, making nine modifications in total:\n\nSince phases 1 and 2 affect the same voiceless sounds, some scholars find it more convenient to treat them together, thus making for only a two-phase process: shifts in voiceless consonants (phases 1–2 of the three-phase model) and in voiced consonants (phase 3). The two-phase model has advantages for typology, but it does not reflect chronology.\n\nOf the other changes that sometimes are bracketed within the High German consonant shift, the most important (sometimes thought of as the fourth phase) is:\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the \"High German\" consonant shift, because the core group affects the High German languages of the mountainous south. It is also known as the \"second Germanic\" consonant shift to distinguish it from the \"(first) Germanic consonant shift\" as defined by Grimm's law and its refinement, Verner's law.\n\nThe High German consonant shift did not occur in a single movement, but rather as a series of waves over several centuries. The geographical extents of these waves vary. They all appear in the southernmost dialects, and spread northwards to differing degrees, giving the impression of a series of pulses of varying force emanating from what is now Austria and Switzerland. Whereas some are found only in the southern parts of Alemannic German (which includes Swiss German) or Bavarian (which includes Austrian), most are found throughout the Upper German area, and some spread on into the Central German dialects. Indeed, Central German is often defined as the area between the / and the / boundaries, thus between complete shift of Germanic (Upper German) and complete lack thereof (Low German). The shift > was more successful; it spread all the way to the North Sea and affected Dutch as well as German. Most of these changes have become part of modern Standard German.\n\nThe High German consonant shift is a good example of a chain shift, as was its predecessor, the first Germanic consonant shift. For example, phases 1 and 2 left the language without a phoneme, as this had shifted to or . Phase 3 filled this gap ( > ), but left a new gap at , which phase 4 then filled ( > ).\n\nThe effects of the shift are most obvious for the non-specialist when comparing Modern German lexemes containing shifted consonants with their Modern English or Dutch unshifted equivalents. The following overview table is arranged according to the original Proto-Indo-European (PIE) phonemes. Note that the pairs of words used to illustrate sound shifts must be cognates; they need not be semantic equivalents. German means \"time\" but it is cognate with \"tide\", and only the latter is relevant here. \nNotes:\n\nThe first phase, which affected the whole of the High German area, affected the voiceless plosives , and in intervocalic and word-final position. These became geminated (long) fricatives, except in word-final position where they were shortened and merged with the existing single consonants. Geminate plosives in words like \"apple\" or \"cat\" were not affected, nor were plosives preceded by another consonant like in \"sharp\" or \"heart\". These remained unshifted until the second phase.\n\n\nThe letter stands for a voiceless fricative that is distinct somehow from . The exact nature of the distinction is unknown; possibly was apical while was laminal (a similar distinction exists in Basque and formerly in Old Spanish). It remained distinct from throughout Old High German and most of the Middle High German period, and was not affected by the late Old High German voicing of prevocalic to .\n\nThis phase has been dated as early as the 4th century, though this is highly debated. The first certain examples of the shift are from the (, oldest extant manuscript after 650), a Latin text of the Lombards. Lombard personal names show > , having , , for , , . According to most scholars, the pre-Old High German runic inscriptions of show no convincing trace of the consonant shift.\n\nIn many West Central German dialects, the words (\"that, what, it\") did not shift to , even though \"t\" was shifted in other words. It is not quite clear why these exceptions occurred.\n\nExamples:\n\nIn the second phase, which was completed by the 8th century, the same sounds became affricates in three environments: in word-initial position; when geminated; and after a liquid ( or ) or nasal ( or ).\n\nExamples:\n\nThe shift did not take place where the plosive was preceded by a fricative, i.e. in the combinations . also remained unshifted in the combination .\n\nFollowing also prevented the shift of in words which end in in modern Standard German, e.g. , . These stems had in OHG inflected forms (, ).\n\nFor the subsequent change of , written , see below.\n\nThese affricates (especially ) have simplified into fricatives in some dialects. was simplified to in a number of circumstances. In Yiddish and some German dialects, this occurred in initial positions, e.g., Dutch : German : Yiddish 'horse'. In modern standard German, the pronunciation for word-initial is also a very common feature of northern and central German accents (i.e. in regions where does not occur in the native dialects; compare German phonology).\n\nThere was an even stronger tendency to simplify after and . This simplification is also reflected in modern standard German, e.g. 'to throw' ← OHG ← , 'to help' ← OHG ← . Only one standard word with remains: 'carp' ← OHG .\n\n\nThe third phase, which had the most limited geographical range, saw the voiced plosives become voiceless.\nOf these, only the dental shift \"d\" > \"t\" universally finds its way into standard German (though with relatively many exceptions, partly due to Low and Central German influence). The other two occur in standard German only in original geminates, e.g. , vs. Dutch , \"rib, bridge\". For single consonants, \"b\" > \"p\" and \"g\" > \"k\" are restricted to High Alemannic German in Switzerland, and south Bavarian dialects in Austria.\nThis shift probably began in the 8th or 9th century, after the first and second phases ceased to be productive; otherwise the resulting voiceless plosives would have shifted further to fricatives and affricates.\n\nIn those words in which an Indo-European voiceless plosive became voiced as a result of Verner's law, phase three of the High German shift returns this to its original value (*t > d > t):\n\nExamples:\n\nThe combination was shifted to only in some varieties of OHG. Written OHG normally has shifted (e.g. \"to bind\"), but in Middle High German and modern standard German the unshifted pronunciation prevails (cf. ). (Although in OHG both and \"to find\" are encountered, these represent earlier forms and , respectively; note the corresponding alternation in Old Saxon and . In this case, corresponds to original Proto-Germanic while * is a later, specifically West Germanic, form, created by analogy with the Verner's law alternant , as in Proto-Germanic \"they found\", \"found\".)\n\nNoteworthy exceptions are modern , and , for which however Middle High German preferred , , . (As all of these three words end in , the modern unvoiced pronunciation might be caused by analogy with , whose stems from original Germanic unshifted before .) In other cases, modern is due to the later loss of a vowel (e.g. from OHG ) or borrowing (e.g. from Low German).\n\nIt is possible that \"pizza\" is an early Italian borrowing of OHG (Bavarian dialect) , a shifted variant of (German , 'bite, snack').\n\nOther consonant changes on the way from West Germanic to Old High German are included under the heading \"High German consonant shift\" by some scholars who see the term as a description of the whole context, but are excluded by others who use it to describe the neatness of the threefold chain shift. Although it might be possible to see > , > and > as a similar group of three, both the chronology and the differing phonetic conditions under which these changes occur speak against such a grouping.\n\nWhat is sometimes known as the fourth phase shifted the dental fricatives to plosives. This shift occurred late enough that unshifted forms are to be found in the earliest Old High German texts, and thus it can be dated to the 9th or 10th century. This shift spread much further north than the others, eventually reaching all continental West Germanic languages (hence excluding only English). It is therefore not uniquely High German; it is nonetheless often grouped together with the other shifts, as it did spread from the same area. The shift took several centuries to spread north, appearing in Dutch only during the 12th century, and in Frisian and Low German not for another century or two after that.\n\nIn early Old High German, as in Old Dutch and Old Saxon, the voiceless and voiced dental fricatives and stood in allophonic relationship (as did , and , ), with in final position and used initially and medially. The sound then became , while became . In Old Frisian, the voiceless fricatives were only voiced medially, and remained voiceless initially except in some pronouns and determiners, much as in Old and Modern English. Thus, modern Frisian varieties have word-initially in most words, and medially.\n\nIn dialects affected by phase 4 but not by the dental variety of phase 3 (Central German, Low German, and Dutch), two Germanic phonemes merged: \"þ\" becomes \"d\", but original Germanic \"d\" remains unchanged:\nOne consequence of this is that there is no dental variety of in Middle Dutch.\n\nA peculiar development took place in stems which had the onsets and in OHG. They were merged in MHG and subsequently shifted to in Upper German and in Central German. Modern German has in , , , , but in , , , . The stems with the Upper German development appear to have undergone the High German consonant shift several times, e.g. (\"to force\") < MHG < OHG < Germanic .\n\nIn 1955, Otto Höfler suggested that a change analogous to the fourth phase of the High German consonant shift may have taken place in Gothic (East Germanic) as early as the 3rd century AD, and he hypothesised that it may have spread from Gothic to High German as a result of the Visigothic migrations westward (c. 375–500 AD). This has not found wide acceptance; the modern consensus is that Höfler misinterpreted some sound substitutions of Romanic languages as Germanic, and that East Germanic shows no sign of the second consonant shift.\n\nMost dialects of Norwegian and Swedish show a shift that is much like the one in Frisian, with > and > . This shift reached Swedish only around the 16th century or so, as the Gustav Vasa Bible of 1541 still shows the dental fricatives (spelled ). This shift may be part of the same development as in the West Germanic languages, or it may have occurred independently. Danish – geographically between West Germanic and Swedish/Norwegian areas – would have had to experienced this shift first, before it could have spread further northwards. However, Danish does not form a dialect continuum with the West Germanic languages, and the shift occurred only word-initially in it, while it retains medially. On the other hand, Danish exhibits widespread lenition phenomena, including shifts from plosives to fricatives and further to approximants word-medially, so it's conceivable that these changes counteracted the earlier hardening of the dental fricatives that had reached Danish from the south (thus initially > , followed by lenition > ), but only after these changes had propagated further north to the remaining Scandinavian dialects.\n\nWest Germanic *ƀ (presumably pronounced ), which was an allophone of used in medial position, shifted to (Upper German) Old High German between two vowels, and also after . Unshifted languages retained a fricative, which became between vowels and in coda position.\n\nIn strong verbs such as German 'heave' and 'give', the shift contributed to eliminating the forms in German, but a full account of these verbs is complicated by the effects of \"\" by which and appear in alternation in different parts of the same verb in the early forms of the languages. In the case of weak verbs such as 'have' (compare Dutch ) and 'live' (Dutch ), the consonant differences have an unrelated origin, being a result of the West Germanic gemination and a subsequent process of levelling.\n\nThis shift also is only partly completed in Central German, with Ripuarian and Moselle Franconian retaining a fricative pronunciation. For example: Colognian , Luxembourgish , meaning \"he lives\".\nThe Proto-Germanic voiced dental fricative , which was an allophone of in certain positions, became a plosive in all positions throughout the West Germanic languages. Thus, it affected High German, Low German, Dutch, Frisian and Old English alike. It did not spread to Old Norse, which retained the original fricative. Because of its much wider spread, it must have occurred very early, during Northwest Germanic times, perhaps around the 2nd century.\n\nEnglish has partially reversed this shift through the change > , for example in \"father\", \"mother\", \"gather\" and \"together\".\n\nIn phase 3 of the High German consonant shift, this was shifted to , as described above.\nThe West Germanic voiced velar fricative shifted to in Upper German dialects of Old High German in all positions. This change is believed to be early and complete by the 8th century at the latest. Since the existence of a was necessary for the south German shift > , this must at least predate phase 3 of the core High German consonant shift.\n\nThe same change occurred independently in Anglo-Frisian (c. 10th century for Old English, as suggested by changing patterns of alliteration), except when preceding or following a front vowel where it had earlier undergone Anglo-Frisian palatalisation and ended up as . Dutch has retained the original , despite the fact it is spelled with , rendering it indistinguishable in writing from its counterparts in other languages.\n\nThe shift is only partly complete in Central German. Most Central German dialects have fricative pronunciation for between vowels () and in coda position (). Ripuarian has word-initially, e.g. Colognian \"good\".\n\nIn standard German, fricative is found in coda position in unstressed ( \"blessed\" but feminine ). One will still very frequently hear fricative in coda position in other cases as well in standard German as pronounced by people from northern and central Germany. For example, and are often pronounced and . Compare German phonology. This pronunciation reaches as far south as Franconia, thus into Upper German areas.\nHigh German experienced the shift > in all positions, and > before another consonant in initial position (original may in fact have been apical , as OHG and MHG distinguish it from the reflex > , spelled ⟨z⟩ or ⟨ȥ⟩ and presumed to be laminal ):\n\nLikewise usually became :\n\nIn the cluster , this change was not reflected in spelling and the modern standard pronunciation, which is partly based on Low German accents, uses . Therefore, is in Modern Standard German, though virtually all High German dialects have in this word.\n\nThe > shift occurred in most West Germanic dialects but notably not in Dutch, which instead had > , while West Frisian retains in all positions. The two other changes did not reach any further than Limburgish and some southern dialects of Low German:\n\nOther changes include a general tendency towards terminal devoicing in German and Dutch, and to a far more limited extent in English. Thus, in German and Dutch, , and (German), (Dutch) at the end of a word are pronounced identically to , and (German), (Dutch). The in German (day) is pronounced as in English \"tack\", not as in English \"tag\". However, this change is not High German in origin but is generally thought to have originated in Frankish, as the earliest evidence for the change appears in Old Dutch texts at a time when there was still no sign of devoicing at all in Old High German or Old Saxon. Terminal devoicing also occurred in the strongly Frankish-influenced Old and Middle French (and to a limited extent in Modern French, where final consonants have otherwise largely been lost).\n\nNevertheless, the original voiced consonants are usually represented in modern German and Dutch spelling. This is because related inflected forms, such as the plural , have the voiced form, since here the plosive is not terminal. As a result of these inflected forms, native speakers remain aware of the underlying voiced phoneme, and spell accordingly. However, in Middle High German, these sounds were spelled differently: singular , plural .\n\nSince the High German consonant shift took place before the beginning of writing of Old High German in the 8th century, the dating of the various phases is an uncertain business. The estimates quoted here are mostly taken from the (p. 63). Different estimates appear elsewhere, for example Waterman, who asserts that the first three phases occurred fairly close together and were complete in Alemannic territory by 600, taking another two or three centuries to spread north.\n\nSometimes historical constellations help us; for example, the fact that Attila is called in German proves that the second phase must have been productive after the Hunnish invasion of the 5th century. The fact that many Latin loan-words are shifted in German (e.g., Latin > German ), while others are not (e.g., Latin > German ) allows us to date the sound changes before or after the likely period of borrowing. However the most useful source of chronological data is German words cited in Latin texts of the late classical and early medieval period.\n\nPrecise dating would in any case be difficult, since each shift may have begun with one word or a group of words in the speech of one locality, and gradually extended by lexical diffusion to all words with the same phonological pattern, and then over a longer period of time spread to wider geographical areas.\n\nHowever, \"relative\" chronology for phases 2, 3, and 4 can easily be established by the observation that \"t\" > \"tz\" must precede \"d\" > \"t\", which in turn must precede \"þ\" > \"d\"; otherwise words with an original \"þ\" could have undergone all three shifts and ended up as \"tz\". By contrast, as the form for \"give\" is attested in Old Bavarian, showing both > > and > > , it follows that > and > must predate phase 3.\n\nAlternative chronologies have been proposed. According to a theory by the controversial German linguist Theo Vennemann, the consonant shift occurred much earlier and was already completed in the early 1st century BC. On this basis, he subdivides the Germanic languages into High Germanic and Low Germanic. Few other linguists share this view.\n\nRoughly, the changes resulting from phase 1 affected Upper and Central German, as did the dental element of phase 2 (\"t-\" > \"z-\"). The other elements of phase 2 and all of phase 3 impacted only Upper German, while those changes from phase 4 affected the entire German and Dutch-speaking region (the West Germanic dialect continuum). The generally accepted boundary between Central and Low German, the – line, is sometimes called the Benrath line, as it passes through the Düsseldorf suburb of Benrath, while the main boundary between Central and Upper German, the – line can be called the Speyer line, as it passes near the town of Speyer, some 200 kilometers further south.\n\nHowever, a precise description of the geographical extent of the changes is far more complex. Not only do the individual sound shifts within a phase vary in their distribution (phase 3, for example, partly affects the whole of Upper German and partly only the southernmost dialects within Upper German), but there are even slight variations from word to word in the distribution of the same consonant shift. For example, the – line lies further north than the – line in western Germany, coincides with it in central Germany, and lies further south at its eastern end, although both demonstrate the same shift /k/ > /x/.\n\nThe subdivision of West Central German into a series of dialects, according to the differing extent of the phase 1 shifts, is particularly pronounced. It is known as the Rhenish fan (, ) because on the map of dialect boundaries, the lines form a fan shape. Here, no fewer than eight isoglosses run roughly West to East and partially merge into a simpler system of boundaries in East Central German. The table on the right lists the isoglosses (bold) and the main resulting dialects (italics), arranged from north to south.\n\nSome of the consonant shifts resulting from the second and third phases appear also to be observable in Lombardic, the early mediaeval Germanic language of Italy, which is preserved in runic fragments of the late 6th and early 7th centuries. However, the Lombardic records are not sufficient to allow a complete taxonomy of the language. It is therefore uncertain whether the language experienced the full shift or merely sporadic reflexes, but b > p is clearly attested. This may mean that the shift began in Italy, or that it spread southwards as well as northwards. Ernst Schwarz and others have suggested that the shift occurred in German as a result of contacts with Lombardic. If, in fact, there is a relationship here, the evidence of Lombardic would force us to conclude that the third phase must have begun by the late 6th century, rather earlier than most estimates, but this would not necessarily require that it had spread to German so early.\n\nIf, as some scholars believe, Lombardic was an East Germanic language and not part of the German language dialect continuum, it is possible that parallel shifts took place independently in German and Lombardic. However, extant words in Lombardic show clear relations to the Bavarian language. Therefore, Werner Betz and others prefer to treat Lombardic as an Old High German variety. There were close connections between Lombards and Proto-Bavarians. For example, the Lombards settled in Tullner Feld — about west of Vienna — until 568, but it is evident that not all Lombards went to Italy after that time; the rest seem to have become part of the then newly formed Bavarian groups.\n\nAccording to Jonas of Bobbio (before 650) in Lombardy, when Columbanus came to the Alemanni at Lake Constance shortly after 600, he made (\"barrels\", English \"cup\", German ) burst. This shows that in the time of Columban the shift from \"p\" to \"f\" had occurred neither in Alemannic nor in Lombardic. But the (643; surviving manuscript after 650) attests the forms ('throwing a corpse out of the grave', German and ), ('a horse', OHG , 'throws the rider off'), and many similar shifted examples. So it is best to see the consonant shift as a common Lombardic—Bavarian—Alemannic shift between 620 and 640, when these tribes had plenty of contact.\n\nAs an example of the effects of the shift one may compare the following texts from the later Middle Ages, on the left a Middle Low German citation from the (1220), which does not show the shift, and on the right the equivalent text from the Middle High German \"\" (1274), which shows the shifted consonants; both are standard legal texts of the period.\n\nThe High German consonant shift – at least as far as the core group of changes is concerned – is an example of an exceptionless sound change and was frequently cited as such by the Neogrammarians. Modern standard German is a compromise form between East Central German and northern Upper German, mainly based on the former but with the consonant pattern of the latter. However, individual words from all German dialects and varieties have found their way into the standard. When a German word contains unshifted consonants, it is often a loanword from either Low German or, less often, Central German. Either the shifted form has become obsolete, as in:\n\nor the two forms are retained as doublets, as in:\n\nOther examples of unshifted words from Low German include:\n\nHowever, the majority of unshifted words in German are loaned from Latin, Romance, English or Slavic:\n\nOther ostensible irregularities in the sound shift, which we may notice in modern Standard German, are usually clarified by checking the etymology of an individual word. Possible reasons include the following:\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to the advent of multiprocess systems, and still in many embedded systems, the addresses for objects were absolute starting at a known location, often zero. Since multiprocessing systems dynamically link and switch between programs it became necessary to be able to relocate objects using position-independent code.\nA linker usually performs relocation in conjunction with symbol resolution, the process of searching files and libraries to replace symbolic references or names of libraries with actual usable addresses in memory before running a program.\n\nRelocation is typically done by the linker at link time, but it can also be done at load time by a relocating loader, or at run time by the running program itself. Some architectures avoid relocation entirely by deferring address assignment to run time; this is known as zero address arithmetic.\n\nObject files are segmented into various memory segment types. Example segments include code segment(.text), initialized data segment(.data), uninitialized data segment(.bss), or others.\n\nThe relocation table is a list of pointers created by the translator (a compiler or assembler) and stored in the object or executable file. Each entry in the table, or \"fixup\", is a pointer to an absolute address in the object code that must be changed when the loader relocates the program so that it will refer to the correct location. Fixups are designed to support relocation of the program as a complete unit. In some cases, each fixup in the table is itself relative to a base address of zero, so the fixups themselves must be changed as the loader moves through the table.\n\nIn some architectures a fixup that crosses certain boundaries (such as a segment boundary) or that is not aligned on a word boundary is illegal and flagged as an error by the linker.\n\nFar pointers (32-bit pointers with segment:offset, used to address 20-bit 640 KB memory space available to DOS programs), which point to code or data within a DOS executable (EXE), do not have absolute segments, because the actual address of code/data depends on where the program is loaded in memory and this is not known until the program is loaded.\n\nInstead, segments are relative values in the DOS EXE file. These segments need to be corrected, when the executable has been loaded into memory. The EXE loader uses a relocation table to find the segments which need to be adjusted.\n\nWith 32-bit Windows operating systems it is not mandatory to provide relocation tables for EXE files, since they are the first image loaded into the virtual address space and thus will be loaded at their preferred base address.\n\nFor both DLLs and for EXEs which opt into address space layout randomization (ASLR) - an exploit mitigation technique introduced with Windows Vista, relocation tables once again become mandatory because of the possibility that the binary may be dynamically moved before being executed, even though they are still the first thing loaded in the virtual address space.\n\nWhen running native 64-bit binaries on Windows Vista and above, ASLR is mandatory, and thus relocation sections cannot be omitted by the compiler.\n\nThe Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) executable format and shared library format used by most Unix-like systems allows several types of relocation to be defined.\n\nThe linker reads segment information and relocation tables in the object files and performs relocation by:\n\n\nThe following example uses Donald Knuth's MIX architecture and MIXAL assembly language. The principles are the same for any architecture, though the details will change. \n\n\n\n\n"}

Both clubs presently using the stadium previously had Ryavallen as their home ground. Until recently it was the only stadium in Allsvenskan built in the last 40 years. The arena is located in Knalleland and is very close to the newly built athletics hall Ryahallen.\n\nThe first game at Borås Arena was IF Elfsborg vs Örgryte IS on 17 April 2005 in the top Swedish league, Allsvenskan. The game ended in a 1–0 victory for Elfsborg, Daniel Mobaeck scoring the goal. The current record attendance is 17,070 and was set 4 July 2005 in a game between IF Elfsborg and Kalmar FF which marked the return of both Anders Svensson and Mathias Svensson.\n\nThe stadium was originally scheduled to be a tournament site for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, but a sponsorship conflict with Max fast food chain's location at the stadium and official UEFA sponsor McDonald's, plus a contractual requirement for official sponsors to have a monopoly over the stadium's area, and a refusal to close the restaurant led to it losing its status as a site for the tournament.\n\nBorås Arena didn't only open a new era for IF Elfsborg but also for other clubs in Allsvenskan, Elfsborg was the first club to build a new arena owned by their investment company. Many other clubs have built new arenas copying the model Elfsborg set up, trying to own their arena which gives big economic resources. \n\nBorås Arena is a football stadium in Borås, Sweden, and it is the home ground of IF Elfsborg and Norrby IF. Borås Arena has an artificial turf pitch, and was changed to the most modern synthetic turf on the market during the UEFA Euro 2012 at a cost of £500,000. The capacity of the arena is 14,500–17,800 depending on usage, 14,800 is mostly the capacity during international matches, due the fact that Uefa would not approve the installation of seats on the standing because of fire risk which means a lower capacity is needed to be approved by Uefa. Borås Arena is located next to Elfsborg's old home ground Ryavallen, both of the stadiums are built together at the roofs, which means that the new stadium is still attached to the old historical Ryavallen.\n\nThe first construction started on 31 December 2003 and was inaugurated April 17, 2005 at a cost of 1,120 000 £. Which was very cheap at this time considering to be Sweden's most modern stadium at that time. It was an effort by Borås Municipality that went out as a lender to Elfsborg. A necessary investment for the club and the city, Elfsborg would own their own stadium by the company Borås Arena AB and would receive all revenues without any intermediaries from matches. Borås Arena didn't only open a new era for IF Elfsborg but also for other clubs in Allsvenskan, Elfsborg was the first club to build a new arena owned by their own investment company. Many other clubs have built new arenas copying the model Elfsborg set up, trying to own their arena which gives big economic resources. Borås Arena consists of four main grandstands; Knallelandsläktaren, Ålgårdsläktaren, Sjuhäradsläktaren and Elfsborgsläktaren. \n\nThe first game at Borås Arena was between IF Elfsborg vs Örgryte IS on 17 April 2005 in the top Swedish league, Allsvenskan. The game ended in a 1–0 victory for Elfsborg, Daniel Mobaeck scoring the only and first goal in history on Borås Arena. The current record attendance is 17,070 and was set 4 July 2005 in a game between IF Elfsborg and Kalmar FF which marked the return of both Anders Svensson and Mathias Svensson. Anders Svensson also became the first on Borås Arena to score a hat-trick in the derby against rivals IFK Göteborg, Elfsborg won with Anders 3 goals, 3–1. The highest attendance on an international tournament was during the Champions League play-off against Valencia CF where 13,148 spectators came to see Elfsborg deal with the Spaniards. Elfsborg lost with 2–1, after a goal by Daniel Alexandersson.\n\nThe stadium was originally scheduled to be a tournament site for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, but a sponsorship conflict with Max fast food chain's location at the stadium and official UEFA sponsor McDonald's, plus a contractual requirement for official sponsors to have a monopoly over the stadium's area, and a refusal to close the restaurant led to it losing its status as a site for the tournament. A strange conflict that led to Elfsborg and Borås Arena lost the championship as an arranger.\n\n2006 was the highlight in Borås Arenas young history. The year when Elfsborg received dividends on their great effort by salvaging the club's 5th SM-Gold. An explicit goal from the club was to win SM-Gold by 2007 and this was accomplished a year in advance, 5 November 2006. The association was strengthened at all levels for a couple of years, not least organizationally and financially, with new sports director \"Mr. Elfsborg\" Stefan Andreasson, President-elect Bosse \"Bank\" Johansson and two billionaires as external funders. The new highly skilled (and young) manager couple Magnus Haglund and Peter Wettergren, who was employed before the 2004 season, was also of course in the club's big bet. The following year (2005) was also \"Elfsborg Fortress\", Borås Arena, completed while enlisted old heroes in the form of Anders and Mathias Svensson came back. Memorable matches this season on Borås Arena was at home the victory against Malmö FF (4-2), which many described as the best in the season and where Anders Svensson made the team's single best effort during the season. Another memorable match was the last and crucial one. Gold match at a packed Borås Arena against Djurgårdens IF where Joakim Sjöhage became gold shooter with the only goal which meant that over 40 years of waiting was over for Elfsborg's fans.\n"}
{"id": "1938984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938984", "title": "Data Access Manager", "text": "Data Access Manager\n\nThe Data Access Manager (DAM) was a database access API for the classic Mac OS, introduced in 1991 as an extension to System 7. Similar in concept to ODBC, DAM saw little use and was eventually dropped in the late 1990s. Only a handful of products ever used it, although it was used for some extremely impressive demoware in the early 1990s. More modern versions of the classic Mac OS, and macOS, use ODBC for this role instead.\n\nDAM and ODBC are similar in many ways. The primary purpose of both systems was to send \"query strings\" to a data provider, who would respond (potentially) with a \"result set\" consisting of rows of data. Both systems were expected to convert data to and from the system's respective formats, integers and strings for instance. Additionally, both provided a communications subsystem that hid the details of sending queries and data between the client and server.\n\nLike most Apple software, DAM attempted to make the query process as simple as possible for the users, both application users and programmers writing those applications. One particularly notable feature was the concept of \"query documents\". Query documents contained any number of pre-defined queries (or other server commands), along with optional code to modify them before being sent to the server. For instance, a typical query document might contain a query string that would log into the database server, and if that was successful, look up the current date from the local client machine using a Mac OS call, and then use that date in a query that returns inventory in a warehouse for a given date. Query documents could also include computer code and resources needed to support this process, for instance, a dialog box asking for the username and password.\n\nApplications could use query documents without having any idea of the internals of the query. They simply opened the document, which consisted of a series of resources, and ran each query resource inside in turn. The DAM would ensure that any needed code in the document would be run without the application even being aware of it, and eventually, results would be passed back to the application for display. The entire operation was opaque, allowing applications to add DAM support with ease.\n\nDAM also included two more direct API's, the High Level interface, and the Low Level interface. High Level was fairly similar to using query documents, although it was expected that the application would construct the queries in code rather than resources. The High Level interface is broadly similar to ODBC's public interface. Low Level allowed the programmer to intercede at any point in the query process, retrieving data line-by-line for instance.\n\nOne major difference between DAM and ODBC came about largely by accident. Prior to the development of DAM, Apple had purchased a database middleware product they sold as the Data Access Language, or DAL. DAL was essentially a standardized SQL with translators for various databases that ran on the server side. Standards for SQL were extremely basic at the time, and relatively poorly supported, DAL addressed this by having a single language and converting to and from the other systems. Client software, including DAM, could send queries in DAL's standard language which would then be translated and executed regardless of the back-end database.\n\nIn contrast, ODBC was developed from the start to be a SQL-based system, based on the standardized Call-Level Interface from X/Open (now part of the Open Group). Under OBDC, every data source was made to look like a SQL server. For serverless sources, such as text files, a local SQL parser would interpret the commands and read the file. Under ODBC, all data source drivers are expected to understand SQL and translate it to the local dialect if needed, as well as convert data into standard formats when it is returned.\n\nThis difference made DAM much less useful than ODBC in practice. Since it was expected that DAL would be providing query standardization, DAM had no layer similar to ODBC's for translating different dialects. In order for DAM to be truly useful, the user also had to buy and install a DAL server for their particular database. DAL was generally known to be slow and expensive, seriously degrading DAM's overall value. Further, DAM did not standardize the language for accessing non-SQL data sources; an adaptor for a text file might use a non-SQL language, or a completely function-call based system instead. Nor were any simple interfaces for text files or similar data sources included with basic DAM installs.\n\nOne of the major clients for DAM was HyperCard, Apple's data manager/rapid application development system. Combining HyperCard's excellent forms system with data from DAM resulted in something that no-one had ever seen before   data-driven GUI apps. The most common demo of the system showed a HyperCard stack querying a series of Baskin-Robbins databases, formerly impossible because each regional area used their own database servers which DAL now combined into one. Reorders for more stock could be made by dragging a series of ice cream scoops on a graphical display of the current warehoused inventory.\n\nThe system was so impressive that it made other database vendors scramble to provide similar systems; Oracle Corporation immediately purchased PLUS from Spinnaker Software, releasing it first as Oracle Card, and then Oracle Media Objects. Other companies followed similar routes, and soon the event-driven database front-end was a standard feature of most systems.\n\nA number of other applications also used the system, perhaps ironically Microsoft's various Office products doing so with the most regularity. Other than that DAM support was fairly rare, and the product did not see widespread use. Perhaps much of this was due to the incomplete nature of the DAM system \"as a whole\"; the need for DAL middleware in most cases, and the lack of low-cost query document builders (there were some expensive ones) made the overhead of using DAM quite high.\n\nWork on DAM ended in the mid-1990s, and disappeared entirely sometime before the release of Mac OS X. A \"classic\" Mac OS version of ODBC was available for some time, although support was limited. Starting with the release of OS X 10.2 \"Jaguar\", Apple started distributing a version of the iODBC cross-platform ODBC drivers. Starting with OS X 10.4 \"Tiger\" Apple has introduced a new and much \"higher level\" system known as Core Data. Core Data allows developers to serialize data into SQLite for processing, similar in concept to ODBC when used with a non-SQL data source.\n\n"}

{"id": "1938997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1938997", "title": "4Matic", "text": "4Matic\n\n4Matic (stylized as 4 \"MATIC\") is the marketing name of an AWD four-wheel drive system developed by Mercedes-Benz. It is designed to increase traction in slippery conditions.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive system was developed in conjunction with Steyr-Daimler-Puch (currently Magna Steyr), who manufactured the Mercedes-Benz G-Class in Austria.\n\nNearly all Mercedes-Benz vehicles that feature this system are paired with an automatic transmission as the default transmission. The first design of 4Matic system was introduced in 1987 on the W124 series (E Class) saloons (four-door) and estate (station wagon) cars. It was available with the 2.6 L and 3.0 L 6-cylinder petrol (gasoline) and diesel engines.\n\nThe first generation 4Matic system was originally a complex electronically controlled system with automatically engaging four-wheel drive (4WD), the system employing locking central and rear differentials to provide additional traction in slippery conditions. The centre differential, also known as the transfer case, contains two clutches. Each hydraulically enabled clutch is controlled separately to allow for three modes of operation: 2WD (mode 0) where 100% of available torque is available to the rear axle while the front axle is disconnected, and two 4WD modes which allow for 35/65 front/rear axle torque split (mode 1) or 50/50 front/rear axle torque split (mode 2). The rear differential lock, previously known as ASD on Mercedes-Benz models, can also be locked (mode 3) if rear wheel slip is still present when the transfer case 50/50 4WD mode 2 is engaged. Due to safety and stability concerns there is no front differential lock. The 4Matic system uses inputs from the three channel ABS system and a steering wheel angle sensor to decide when to intervene. 4WD is disengaged automatically if the ABS service brakes are applied. Engine throttle control is not inherent in the W124 system. Two W124 variants of the 4Matic system were produced: the first system (1986–1991) used a mechanical pressure test lever to disable the system hydraulically while the second system variant (1992/1993) used an electrical test switch to break power to the system. The later system variant when in test mode allows for continued operation of the rear shock self-levelling system (SLS) when installed. Initially plagued with reliability factors, the multi-plate clutch central differentials were subject to failure; it was discontinued in 1993.\n\nThe second generation of 4Matic was reintroduced on the W210 series in 1998/1999. Available only with left hand drive, the cars were again manufactured at the Magna-Steyr plant in Austria. The second generation of 4Matic utilized a full-time 4-wheel drive system with three open differentials front, centre and rear. Traction control is achieved using ETS (Electronic Traction System). This employs the ABS system with additional valves to monitor and then partially brake any wheel which loses traction. This much simpler system is also featured in the Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV.\n\nSince 2008, some versions of 4Matic have provided true AWD where the system is permanently active. Sophisticated engine management and ABS systems control the amount of torque transferred to each wheel, allowing the system to be effective at any speed.\n\nIn 2016, Mercedes introduced a new 4WD system called 4Matic+. This system can send 100 percent of the available engine torque to either the front or rear axles. In the fifth-generation E-Class an additional setting was introduced in the E63 S AMG model that disconnects the front axle from the powertrain, effectively turning it into a rear wheel drive automobile. This has become known as \"Drift Mode\", riding the wave of attention drawn by the eponymous setting first deployed in the third-generation Ford Focus RS. \n\nThe second and third generation 4Matic systems are currently available on the A-Class, B-Class, C-Class, E-Class, G-Class, S-Class (and former CL), GLA-Class, GLK-Class (\"GLC\"), ML-Class (\"GLE\"), GL-Class (\"GLS\"), GT CLA-Class, CLS-Class, Vito and Viano (North American name; Metris), and Sprinter 4x4 although certain right-hand-drive models are not available due to the position of the steering column. These later systems include engine and automatic stability controls.\n\n\n"}

He learned piano, was a childhood friend of Curtis Mayfield, Major Lance and Jerry Butler, and began singing in doo-wop groups in his teens. In 1962 he took an audition at Chess Records, where he recorded his debut single, \"Look at Me Now\". At the same time as attending college, he then began performing in folk clubs and coffee houses in Chicago, becoming strongly influenced by the music of John Coltrane. He met Samuel Charters of Prestige Records in 1964, and the following year they recorded his debut album. Charters then took the tapes away with him into the Mexican desert, and the album was eventually released in 1968 as \"The New Folk Sound of Terry Callier\". Two of Callier's songs, \"Spin, Spin, Spin\" and \"It's About Time\", were recorded by the psychedelic rock band H. P. Lovecraft in 1968, as part of their \"H. P. Lovecraft II\" album. H. P. Lovecraft featured fellow Chicago folk club stalwart George Edwards, who would go on to co-produce several tracks for Callier in 1969.\n\nHe continued to perform in Chicago, and in 1970 joined the Chicago Songwriters Workshop set up by Jerry Butler. He and partner Larry Wade wrote material for Chess and its subsidiary Cadet label, including The Dells' 1972 hit \"The Love We Had Stays on My Mind\", as a result of which he was awarded his own recording contract with Cadet as a singer-songwriter. Three critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful albums followed, produced by Charles Stepney: \"Occasional Rain\" (1972), \"What Color Is Love\" (1972), and \"I Just Can't Help Myself\" (1974). These demonstrated that Callier's influences included R&B, soul and jazz. Subsequently, he toured with George Benson, Gil Scott-Heron and others. Cadet and its parent label Chess were sold in 1976 and Callier was then dropped from the label. The Songwriters Workshop closed in 1976. The following year, he signed a new contract with Elektra Records, releasing the albums \"Fire On Ice\" (1977) and \"Turn You to Love\" (1978). The opening track of the latter album, \"Sign Of The Times\", was used as the theme tune of radio DJ Frankie Crocker and became Callier's only US chart success, reaching # 78 on the R&B chart in 1979 and prompting his appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival.\n\nCallier continued to perform and tour until 1983, when he gained custody of his daughter and retired from music to take classes in computer programming, landing a job at the University of Chicago and returning to college during the evenings to pursue a degree in sociology. He re-emerged from obscurity in the late 1980s, when British DJs discovered his old recordings and began to play his songs in clubs. Acid Jazz Records head Eddie Piller reissued a little-known Callier recording from 1983, \"I Don't Want to See Myself (Without You)\", and brought him to play clubs in Britain. From 1991 he began to make regular trips to play gigs during his vacation time from work.\n\nIn 1994 Urban Species released their debut album \"Listen\", the title track containing a sample of the bass line and guitar riff from Callier's 1973 recording \"You Goin' Miss Your Candyman\". In the late 1990s Callier began his comeback to recorded music, collaborating with Urban Species on their 1997 EP \"Religion and Politics\" and contributed to Beth Orton's \"Best Bit\" EP in 1997 before releasing the album \"Timepeace\" in 1998, which won the United Nations' Time For Peace award for outstanding artistic achievement contributing to world peace. His colleagues at the University of Chicago did not know of Callier's life as a musician, but after the award the news of his work as a musician became widely known and subsequently led to his dismissal by the University.\n\nAs well as touring internationally, Callier continued his recording career, releasing five albums after \"Timepeace\", including \"Lifetime\" (1999), \"Alive\" (2001), \"Speak Your Peace\" (2002), featuring Paul Weller on the single \"Brother to Brother\", \"Golden Apples of the Sun\" (2003), featuring the words of W. B. Yeats' poem \"The Song of the Wandering Aengus\", and \"Lookin' Out\" (2004). May 2009 saw his album \"Hidden Conversations\" featuring Massive Attack released on Mr Bongo records. In 2001, Callier performed \"Satin Doll\" for the Red Hot Organization's compilation album \"Red Hot + Indigo\", a tribute to Duke Ellington, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease.\n\nHe died from cancer on October 27, 2012, aged 67.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Terry Callier among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939011", "title": "Optative mood", "text": "Optative mood\n\nThe optative mood ( or ; abbreviated ) is a grammatical mood that indicates a wish or hope. It is similar to the cohortative mood, and is closely related to the subjunctive mood.\n\nEnglish has no morphological optative, but there are various constructions which impute an optative meaning. One uses the modal verb \"may\", e.g. May you have a long life!\" Another uses the phrase \"if only\" with a verb in the past or past subjunctive, e.g. If only I were rich!\" Another uses the present subjunctive, e.g. \"God save the Queen!\"\n\nExamples of languages with a morphological optative mood are Ancient Greek, Albanian, Armenian, Georgian, Friulian, Kazakh, Kurdish, Navajo, Old Prussian, Old Persian, Sanskrit, Turkish, and Yup'ik.\n\nThe optative is one of the four original moods of Proto-Indo-European (the other three being the indicative mood, the subjunctive mood, and the imperative mood). However, many Indo-European languages lost the inherited optative, either as a formal category, or functional, i.e. merged it with the subjunctive, or even replaced the subjunctive with optative.\n\nIn Albanian, the optative (\"mënyra dëshirore\", lit. \"wishing mood\") expresses wishes, and is also used in curses and swearing. \n\nIn Ancient Greek, the optative is used to express wishes and potentiality in independent clauses. In dependent clauses (purpose, temporal, conditional, and indirect speech), the optative is often used under past-tense main verbs. The optative expressing a wish is on its own or preceded by the particle εἴθε (\"eithe\"). The optative expressing potentiality is always accompanied by the untranslatable particle ἄν in an independent clause and is on its own in a dependent clause.\n\n\nIn Koine Greek, the optative began to be replaced by the subjunctive; in the New Testament, it was primarily used in set phrases.\n\nIts endings are characterized by (\"oi\") in thematic verbs and in athematic verbs.\n\nSome Germanic verb forms often known as subjunctives are actually descendants of the Proto-Indo-European optative. The Gothic present subjunctive \"nimai\" \"may he take!\" may be compared to Ancient Greek present optative \"may he bear!\" That the old Indo-European optative is represented by the subjunctive is clear in Gothic, which lost the old, \"true\" Indo-European subjunctive that represented a fixed desire and intent. Its function was adopted by the present form of the optative that reflected only possibilities, unreal things and general wishes at first.\n\nA Germanic innovation of form and functionality was the past tense of the optative, which reflected the irrealis of past and future. This is shown by evidence in the Gothic language, Old High German, Old English, and Old Norse. This use of the (new) optative past tense as an irrealis mood started apparently after the Proto-Germanic past tense that had been once the perfect tense supplanted the Indo-German aorist (compare Euler 2009:184).\n\nA somewhat archaic Dutch saying, 'Leve de Koning' (\"long live the king\") is another example of how the optative still is present in Germanic languages today.\n\nLikewise in Latin, the newer subjunctive is based on the Indo-European optative. With this change in Latin, several old subjunctive forms became future forms. Accordingly, the prohibitive (negative desire and prohibition) was formed with the combination of *ne + verb form in the optative present.\n\nIn Romanian, the conditional and optative moods have identical forms, thus being commonly referred to as the optative-conditional mood.\n\nIn Sanskrit, the optative is formed by adding the secondary endings to the verb stem. It sometimes expresses wishes, requests and commands: \"bhares\" \"may you bear\" (active voice) and \"bharethās\" \"may you bear [for yourself]\" (middle). It also expresses possibilities (e.g. \"kadācid goṣabdena budhyeta\" \"he might perhaps wake up due to the bellowing of cows\") or doubt and uncertainty (e.g., \"katham vidyām Nalam\" \"how would I be able to recognize Nala?\"). The optative is sometimes used instead of a conditional mood.\n\nIn Finnish, the optative or the second imperative, is archaic, mainly appearing in poetry, and used in suppletion with the first imperative. It is formed using the suffixes -\"ko-\" and -\"kö-\", depending on vowel harmony, whereas the first imperative uses the suffixes -\"ka-\" and -\"kä-\", both cases subjected to consonant gradation; for instance, \"kävellös\" (thou shalt walk) is the active voice second person singular in present optative of the verb \"kävellä\" (to walk), and \"ällös kävele\" is the negative (don’t walk). (The corresponding first imperative forms are \"kävele\" and \"älä kävele\".)\n\nAltogether there can be constructed 28 verb inflections in the optative, complete with active and passive voice, present and perfect, three person forms both in singular and plural and a formal plural form. Most, if not all, of these forms are, however, utterly rare and are not familiar to non-professionals. Only some expressions have remained in day-to-day speech; for instance, one can be heard to say \"ollos hyvä\" instead of \"ole hyvä\" (\"you're welcome\" or \"here you go\"). This form carries an exaggerated, jocular connotation.\n\nOptative formality can be expressed with the 1st and the 2nd imperative. For example, the ninth Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights begins with \"Älköön ketään pidätettäkö mielivaltaisesti\", \"Not anyone shall be arrested arbitrarily\", where \"älköön pidätettäkö\" \"shall not be arrested\" is the imperative of \"ei pidätetä\" \"is not arrested\". (Also, using the conditional mood \"-isi-\" in conjunction with the clitic \"-pa\" yields an optative meaning, e.g. \"olisinpa\" \"if I only were\". Here, it is evident that the wish is not, and probably will not be, fulfilled.)\n\nThe Japanese optative is formed by using a conditional such as \"ba\" (-ば) or \"tara\" (-たら). For example, \"I wish there were more time\" is expressed literally as \"If there were time, it would be good.\" (時間があればいいのに \"jikan ga areba ii noni\"), where \"aru\", the verb expressing existence, is in the \"ba\" conditional form \"areba\". \"Ii\" is the present tense of \"good,\" but if expressed in the past tense \"yokatta\" よかった, the sentence expresses regret instead of a wish or hope. The above example would become \"If there had been time, it would have been good\" 時間があればよかったのに, as might be said of an opportunity missed because of a lack of time.\n\nThe optative mood can also be expressed by suffixing ように \"you ni\" to the verb, typically the polite form. For instance, \"may you have a pleasant trip\" 楽しい旅になりますように.\n\nThe Mongolian optative or \"wishing form\" (Хүсэх Хэлбэр) is used largely to \"tell another person about a wish not connected to the listener\". Colloquially, however, it can also be used for a wishful second person imperative. It is formed by joining the suffix -аасай/-ээсэй/-оосой to the root stem of the verb. e.g.\nҮзэх= to see. үз—ээсэй.\n\nМиний дүнг ээж үзээсэй \nMinii düng eej üzeesei.\n\"If only mum could see my results.\"\n\nIt can also be used to form wishes in the past tense.\n\nЧи ирсэн баиж ч болоосой \nChi irsen baij ch boloosoi.\n\"If only you had come.\"\n\nIn Sumerian, the optative of the 1st person is formed differently from the other persons:\n\nThereby, take note that the \"normal\" indicator of the 1st person in the cohortative (would be a suffix \"-en\") is mostly omitted, as with the cohortative prefix, the 1st person is already expressed. In the case of the precative, the personal indicator has to be used to differentiate between the 2nd and 3rd person.\n\nThe optative in Turkish is part of the \"wish mood\" (\"dilek kipi\") which reflects the command, desire, necessity, or wish. It has several semantic nuances. For instance, the word for \"to come\" (infinitive: gelmek\") is modified in the optative to geleyim\". This creates also a one-word sentence and means according to the context \n\nTakes the -a or -e suffix.\n\nIt takes the -sa or -se suffix. The following example reflect a wish:\n\n"}

{"id": "1939030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939030", "title": "Lymantriinae", "text": "Lymantriinae\n\nThe Lymantriinae (formerly called the Lymantriidae) are a subfamily of moths of the family Erebidae. The taxon was erected by George Hampson in 1893.\n\nMany of its component species are referred to as \"tussock moths\" of one sort or another. The caterpillar, or larval, stage of these species often has a distinctive appearance of alternating bristles and haired projections. Many tussock moth caterpillars have urticating hairs (often hidden among longer, softer hairs), which can cause painful reactions if they come into contact with skin.\n\nThe subfamily Lymantriinae includes about 350 known genera and over 2,500 known species found in every continent except Antarctica. They are particularly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and South America. One estimate lists 258 species in Madagascar alone. Apart from oceanic islands, notable places that do not host lymantriines include the Antilles and New Caledonia.\n\nAdult moths of this subfamily do not feed. They usually have muted colours (browns and greys), although some are white, and tend to be very hairy. Some females are flightless, and some have reduced wings. Usually, the females have a large tuft at the end of the abdomen. The males, at least, have tympanal organs. They are mostly nocturnal, but Schaefer lists 20 confirmed diurnal species and 20 more likely diurnal species (based on reduced eye size).\n\nThe larvae are also hairy, often with hairs packed in tufts, and in many species the hairs break off very easily and are extremely irritating to the skin (especially members of the genus \"Euproctis\"). This highly effective defence serves the moth throughout its life cycle. The hairs are incorporated into the cocoon. An emerging adult female of some species collects and stores the hairs at the tip of the abdomen and uses them to camouflage and protect the eggs as they are laid. In other species, the eggs are covered by a froth that soon hardens or are camouflaged by material the female collects and sticks to them. In the larvae of some species, hairs are gathered in dense tufts along the back and this gives them the common name of tussocks or tussock moths.\n\n\"Lymantria\" means \"destroyer\", and several species are important defoliators of forest trees, including the gypsy moth \"Lymantria dispar\", the Douglas-fir tussock moth \"Orgyia pseudotsugata,\" and the nun moth \"Lymantria monacha\". They tend to have broader host plant ranges than most Lepidoptera. Most feed on trees and shrubs, but some are known from vines, herbs, grasses, and lichens.\nSeveral genera are classified into five tribes, while others remain unclassified (\"incertae sedis\"):\n\nSee also the list of Lymantriinae genera.\n\nTaxonomy is a dynamic discipline, and recent phylogenetic studies have reclassified the family Lymantriidae as the subfamily Lymantriinae of the newly formed family Erebidae. The studies found that the family Lymantriidae form a specialized lineage within the Erebidae and is part of a clade that includes the litter moths (Herminiinae), the Aganainae, and the tiger and lichen moths (Arctiinae). The reclassification affected the former family as a whole and largely kept the clade intact. \n\nThis description clarifies the standing of the former name \"Lymantriidae\" relative to other proposed names, e.g. Liparidae and other currently unacceptable alternatives. It authoritatively explains the status of the family name Lymantriidae and its various alternatives as matters stood towards the end of the 20th century:\n\nFrom \"The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma: Moths Volume I\" by Hampson, page 432:This family was first separated under the name Lariidae Newman, 1832, \"Sphinx vespiformis\", an essay: 40, 44 (as Lariae), based on the nominal genus \"Laria\" Schrank, 1802, a junior homonym of \"Laria\" Scopoli, 1763. The next name established for this family was Liparidae Boisduval, 1834, Icon. hist. Lepid. nouv. ou peu connus 2: 134 (as Liparides), based on the nominal genus \"Liparis\" Ochsenheimer, 1810, a junior homonym of \"Liparis\" Scopoli, 1777. Neither of these family-group names may be used as a valid name, the type-genus in each case being a junior homonym.\n\nThese names have also been established for the family:\n\n(a) Orgyiidae Wallengren, 1861, K. svenska Fregatten Eugenies Resa ... C.A. Virgin aren 1851-1853 (Zool.) 1 (10, Lepidoptera): 369 (as Orgyides), based on the nominal genus \"Orgyia\" Ochsenheimer, 1810;\n(b) Dasychiridae Packard, 1864, Proc. ent. Soc. Philad. 3: 331 (as Dasychirae), based on the nominal genus \"Dasychira\" Hübner, [1809];\n(c) Lymantriidae Hampson, 1893, Fauna Br. India (Moths) 1: 432, based on the nominal genus \"Lymantria\" Hübner, [1819];\n(d) Leucomidae Grote, 1895, Mitt. Roemermus. Hildesh. 1: 3, based on the nominal genus \"Leucoma\" Hübner, 1822;\n(e) Ocneriidae Meyrick, 1895, Handbk Br. Lepid.: 169 (as Ocneriadae), based on the nominal genus \"Ocneria\" Hübner, [1819];\n(f) Hypogymnidae Grote, 1896, Mitt Roemermus. Hildesh. 7: 3, based on the nominal genus \"Hypogymna\" Billberg, 1820.\n\nOf the family-group names listed in the last paragraph Liparidae was the most widely used during the 19th century; Orgyiidae and Dasychiridae had minor usage, but neither name became widely adopted. During the present century, Orgyiidae has been used occasionally in contrast with Lymantriidae, which has been used many hundreds of times throughout the world. In North America, the use of Liparidae has continued until, in the most recent revision of the family by Ferguson. The family name Lymantriidae has been adopted.\n\nBecause of the overwhelming worldwide use of the name Lymantriidae, an application has been submitted by D. S. Fletcher, I. W. B. Nye and D. C. Ferguson to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature requesting them to rule that the family-group name Lymantriidae Hampson [1893] is to be given nomenclatural precedence over the family-group names Orgyiidae Wallengren. 1861, and Dasychiridae Packard, 1864, when applied to the same taxon.\n\nAs pointed out, \"Liparidae\" once was an alternative family name for the Lymantriidae, but nowadays \"Liparidae\" is firmly established as the name of a family of fish, and according to the conventions of Zoological taxonomy, family names have to be unique, even though they are permitted to coincide with botanical names.\n\n\nIn \"The God of Small Things\" by Arundhati Roy, the character Pappachi discovers a new species of lymantriid with \"unusually dense dorsal tufts\". At first, his discovery is misclassified as a race of an existing species. After Pappachi retires from the post of imperial entomologist, a taxonomic revision makes his moth the type species of a new genus. Pappachi's original claim is forgotten and the new genus is named for a former subordinate. The disappointment embitters Pappachi:\n"}

Its elevation is . Chacaltaya's glacier — which was as old as 18,000 years — had an area of in 1940, which had been reduced to in 2007 and was completely gone by 2009. Half of the meltdown, as measured by volume, took place before 1980. The final meltdown after 1980, due to missing precipitation and the warm phase of El Niño, resulted in the glacier's disappearance in 2009. The glacier was located about from La Paz, near Huayna Potosí mountain.\n\nThe glacier on Chacaltaya served as Bolivia's only ski resort. It was the world's highest lift-served ski area and the northernmost in South America as well as the world's second most equatorial after Maoke, Indonesia. The rope tow, the very first in South America, was built in 1939 using an automobile engine; it was housed in the site's original clapboard lodge, and is now inoperable. The road to the base of the drop is reached by a narrow road, also built in the 1930s. Traditionally, due to the extreme cold weather, the lift operated exclusively on weekends from November to March. Since 2009, skiing is restricted to a stretch that sometimes receives sufficient snowfall for a run during the winter. The mountain is also popular with amateur mountaineers, as the road stops only from the summit. Guinness World Records considers the ski resort restaurant to be the highest restaurant in the world.\n\nScientists at the Mount Chacaltaya Laboratory started measuring the Chacaltaya glacier in the 1990s. Predicted at that time to survive until 2015, the glacier melted at a faster rate than expected. By 2009, it had been reduced to a few small patches of ice and snow near the top of the mountain.\n\nMany Bolivians on the Altiplano and in two of Bolivia's main cities — La Paz and El Alto — partially depend on melt water from Andean glaciers for their water supply during the dry season. The World Bank has warned that many glaciers in the tropical portion of the Andes are expected to disappear within 20 years. This will threaten the water supplies of nearly 80 million people as well as the future generation of hydropower. Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru depend on hydropower for about half their electricity.\n\nLocated at , the Mount Chacaltaya Laboratory began as a weather station in 1942. It is an important site for gamma ray research and was the site in the 1940s of the first observations of pions.\n\nThe Chacaltaya Observatory belongs to the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés and it is operated in collaboration with other universities worldwide. It hosts a cosmic ray research group, and since 2011 the Chacaltaya Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station. The GAW station is one of the few monitoring sites of Essential Climate Variables (meteorological variables, aerosols and greenhouse gases) in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n\n"}

Neighboring the city are the mountain slopes of the Serra da Mantiqueira range. The climate sees heavy rain in the summer months with dry weather in the winter.\n\nThe city is a center with direct influence over 14 other municipalities of a region (called \"Microregião do Sapucaí\") that contains 6% of the population of Minas Gerais state. The local economy is based mainly on industry and agriculture. There are industries of auto parts, fiber optics, textile, electronic components, helicopters (Helibrás), and military weapons (IMBEL). In agriculture, most of the production is coffee, banana, potatoes, and is centred in the vicinity of Maria da Fé city where the climate is cooler.\n\nIn the beginning of the 19th century, the region was mostly occupied by native Brazilians, the Puri-Coroados. In January 1819, priest Lourenço da Costa Moreira moved to the parish of Delfim Moreira (known at that time as \"Soledade de Itajubá\"). The place was deserted, since it was just a small village in the middle of the woods of the Serra da Mantiqueira, far away from a river. Moreira told the people in the settlement that its topography was unfavorable to its development. He invited them to move the village to a place closer to the Sapucaí River, down the mountains. About 80 families accepted the invitation and, on the morning of March 18, 1819 they moved. The next day, Moreira celebrated the first catholic mass in the new location. The new Itajubá was founded. After comparisons of topography had been made, part of the population decided to build a new church. Moreira then gathered the people and they moved the old church's pictures and items to the new church.\n\nAccording to historians Geraldino Campista and J. Armelim Bernardo Guimarães, the name Itajubá means \"water that falls on the rock\" or \"waterfall\". There are several small waterfalls scattered in the vicinities of Itajubá.\n\nThe town is also the site of the Federal University of Itajubá, founded in 1913, which offers degrees in several technical fields, and also three other regionally important educational institutions: the Centro Universitário de Itajubá - Universitas (Itajubá University Center), the Faculdade de Medicina de Itajubá (Itajubá College of Medicine) and the FACESM - Faculdade de Ciências Sociais e Econômicas do Sul de Minas (South Minas Gerais Economic and Social Sciences College).\n\nThe city has two weekly newspapers, six radio stations (FM and AM) and a local TV station.

Villegas' erratic play matched his versatility – brilliant one moment, awful the next – earning him the sarcastic nickname \"The Greatest Metro Ever\". Despite his inconsistency, he scored a number of key goals, including an overtime game winner in a comeback against the Tampa Bay Mutiny in 2000. Overall, Villegas scored 13 goals and 21 assists in his Metro career, adding two goals and two assists in the playoffs.\n\nOn May 10, 2002, the MetroStars traded Villegas and defender Orlando Perez to D.C. United for Craig Ziadie and Mark Lisi. At the time of the trade, Villegas had started all seven MetroStars' games that season. He spent the rest of the year with D.C., scoring two goals and adding five assists. Villegas left MLS afterwards, going back to his native Ecuador to play for Aucas, Barcelona SC, Manta and Deportivo Cuenca. In 2005, he came back to the United States, signing with the Puerto Rico Islanders of the USL First Division. He continued with the Puerto Rico Islanders until the end of the 2009 season.\n\nVillegas signed with River Plate Puerto Rico of the USL for the 2011 season, but played just three games before the team was removed from USL Pro due to financial difficulties. He moved back to the Islanders in the North American Soccer League in June. His contract was not renewed at the end of the season.\n\nIn 2008, having been a resident of Puerto Rico for three years, Villegas made his debut with the Puerto Rican national team, scoring a goal against the Dominican Republic, which enabled Puerto Rico to advance to the next stage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1939087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939087", "title": "Highland Park Independent School District", "text": "Highland Park Independent School District\n\nHighland Park Independent School District (HPISD) is a public school district based in University Park, Texas, within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. HPISD serves most of the town of Highland Park, all of the city of University Park, and two small portions of Dallas. Those two portions are one that is north of Greenbrier Drive, south of Northwest Highway, east of the Dallas North Tollway, and west of Douglas Avenue; and one that is west of Preston Road and north of Colgate Avenue. The Dallas Independent School District surrounds HPISD on all sides. HPISD administers seven schools and seven campuses. The District is run by a school board consisting of seven elected, unpaid members. The District's number for TEA reporting purposes is 057911.\n\nJohn Scarbrough Armstrong was one of the major founders of the town and contents of Highland Park because he owned significant portions of the land that would become the town. In 1906, Armstrong purchased 1,400 acres of prairie land north of downtown Dallas. After his death on April 26, 1908, his widow and sons-in-law—Edgar Flippen and Hugh Prather—took over his work. On April 14, 1914, the newly incorporated town of Highland Park petitioned the Dallas County Judge to allow them to establish an independent school district. From 1909 until this time, children wishing to attend school had attended classes in a little red frame house operating under the name of \"Highland Park School\" that had been moved to the 4700 block of Abbott by community leader Michael Costello and a group of citizens. However, the judge granted the petition for an independent school district on May 5, 1914, and HPISD was born. Once the school district held an election for the first Board of Trustees, the Board began searching for a suitable location for the new school. Mrs. Alice Armstrong, widow of the late John S. Armstrong, generously donated the needed land in the area bounded by Cornell Avenue, Byron Avenue, and St. John's Drive in memory of her husband, thus helping found the HPISD and its first school, appropriately named Armstrong. The Board of Trustees approved $30,000 in bonds to build the new Armstrong School on July 16, 1914.\n\nHighland Park residents spearheaded the creation of the HPISD and asked the neighbors to the north to become a part of the district; taxes were lower since the district included University Park's population.\n\nInitially the district did not receive funds from the U.S. federal government. Its student body was entirely white. The servants' quarters in the houses did not have black children as the wealthy white families did not hire servants with families. As a result, HPISD had no black children in the 1950s and 1960s, when other Dallas-area school districts dealt with racial integration and white flight. The federal court orders to integrate had no effect in HPISD since it did not receive federal money.\n\nAs a result, values of HPISD-zoned properties in University Park rose dramatically and the demographic makeup became wealthier, with smaller houses being replaced by larger ones circa the 1970s.\n\nHPISD first opened its doors on October 12, 1914, with John S. Armstrong School, a one-story cream-yellow brick building on Cornell Avenue with only four rooms and a basement. The staff at the time included one principal, Belle Francis, and two teachers. The fourth room was not needed and thus served as a Sunday school room. There being no easy transportation system, students simply walked to school each morning across the open fields that would later become residential areas of Highland Park. After the passage of a couple years to 1916, the staff had grown in size to include twelve teachers, most without college degrees, and the student enrollment had grown to 140 students, ranging from kindergartners to high school sophomores. Students wishing to complete high school had to go to Bryan Street High School in Dallas (originally called Dallas High School and later Crozier Tech). Some of the Armstrong School staff at the time included Francis herself as well as Mary Inis (kindergarten), Katherine Mansfield (first grade), and Anne Rose McLean (second grade). To accommodate these increases in size, a second story was added to the original Armstrong School building in 1916 which allowed for an additional four classrooms, a clinic, and an office. The first-ever HPISD yearbook was published following the 1916–1917 school year under the title \"The Highlander\", a name which remains to this day. It was dedicated to Mrs. Armstrong with the following inscription:\n\nTO HER who has ever proven in every way a faithful friend of our beloved school, and an ardent sympathizer in and promoter of its best interest, to Mrs. John S. Armstrong, this, our first volume is affectionately dedicated.\n\nFollowing the approval of the 2015 bond package, Armstrong Elementary School will receive a much-needed addition and renovation which began in December 2017.\n\nIn 1922, a second school was added to the district: a new building between Normandy Avenue and Granada Avenue which would house Highland Park High School. Grades eight and above moved to the new high school, and the first class graduated from Highland Park High School in 1924. Superintendent Gable moved his office from Armstrong School to the high school. After the addition of the high school building on Emerson Avenue, this building turned the home of Highland Park Junior High School for students in grades seven through nine. Eventually it would come to house Highland Park Middle School and Arch H. McCulloch Intermediate School and collectively serve grades five through eight. Following the approval of the 2015 bond package, the building will receive a parking garage built underneath the existing athletics fields.\n\nAs the student body size increased, the district added another school in 1926, Bradfield Elementary, located between Southern Avenue and Mockingbird Lane. The funds for the school came from a 1925 bond election for $250,000 to build the Bradfield Elementary and University Park Elementary Schools. To conserve money, both schools had identical blueprints: two-story brick structures with 12 rooms each. Named after former HPISD board president John S. Bradfield, Bradfield Elementary School is located in Block 150 of Highland Park West, and uses a Spanish Colonial Revival style. Foshee & Creek designed the school building with a cost of $68,200. The building permit was filed in 1930. Following the approval of the 2015 bond package, Bradfield Elementary School will be torn down and rebuilt beginning in the summer of 2018.\n\nIn 1928, the District added University Park Elementary School on Lovers Lane with the remaining funds from the 1925 bond election discussed above. The school was named after the city that it served. The time capsule was presumably discovered during the 2017 demolition of the building. Following the approval of the 2015 bond package, University Park Elementary School closed its doors for the 2017–2018 school year and was completely demolished. On May 17, 2017, before the demolition of the school, the District allowed former students and educators a chance to visit one last time. The demolition also affected longtime janitor Jesus Gonzalez who had lived in a District-owned house on the UP campus for years; in 2017, the community surprised Gonzalez and his wife with a check for $53,000 and the District agreed to provide them housing for the rest of their lives. UP Elementary School students attended classes in the new building on Wentwood Drive during this time—what would become the fifth elementary school. They were the first students to ever use the new building on Wentwood Drive. Meanwhile, a new building for UP Elementary School was being built with a parking garage underneath it. The new UP Elementary School is on track to open in August 2018 for the 2018–2019 school year. The rebuild was done by Stantec Inc. and Balfour Beatty Construction.\n\nIn 1937, a new building on Emerson Avenue opened its doors and became the home of Highland Park High School—where the high school has remained to this day. It cost taxpayers approximately $400,000 at the time. At around the same time, the education system added a twelfth grade, so the new Highland Park High School served students in grades ten through twelve. The old high school building on Normandy Avenue became a junior high school for students in grades seven through nine. The new building featured 32 classrooms, 2 gyms, 2 auditoriums, a library, a cafeteria, an armory, a clinic, offices, a public address system, tennis courts, a greenhouse, and a football field with permanent seats. In 1951, a new administration building near the high school campus opened. Today, Highland Park High School features three large plaques just inside the main entrance on Emerson Avenue which list the names of all HPHS alumni who went on to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nFrom 1947-1949, yet another elementary was built: Hyer Elementary School, which opened for classes in January 1949. The building would have opened in 1941 if not for a steel shortage caused by World War II which delayed the construction. The Hyer Elementary School building was designed by architect Mark Lemmon and cost $408,000. Hyer Elementary School was named after Dr. Robert Stewart Hyer, a pioneer in education in Texas and the president of Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, from 1898 to 1911. Dr. Hyer is also well known for helping to found nearby Southern Methodist University and serving as its first president from 1911 to 1920. Newton L. Manning was the first principal of Hyer and frequently brought chickens, goats, and other animals to entertain the students. Following the approval of the 2015 bond package, Hyer Elementary School will be torn down and rebuilt beginning in the summer of 2019.\n\nThe HPISD administration decided that the new Hyer will only have two stories instead of three after members of the community expressed opposition to a three-story design.\n\nIn 2017 following a $361.4 million bond package approval which funded its land purchase and building, the most recent elementary school building between Wentwood Drive and Northwest Highway was added; the three-story building will house students from the other four existing elementary schools on a rotational basis until renovations are completed on the four campuses. The building currently serves as the home of the University Park Elementary School for the 2017–2018 school year. Because it was the first new school to be built in HPISD in nearly 70 years, much thought went into the design of the school. Key elements included larger classrooms, flexible group learning spaces, an underground parking garage, and an exterior appearance that mimicked that of the existing HPISD schools. It took from 20 June 2016 until August 2017 to complete the construction. Balfour Beatty Construction served as general contractor for the building process.\n\nIn summary, today the District comprises seven campuses: five elementary school buildings, one middle school building, and one high school building. The district has an enrollment of approximately 7,000 students and employs 750 people, including more than 430 teachers. University Park Elementary School was designed by famed Dallas architects, Lang & Witchell who designed the Magnolia Building and the Kirby Building downtown.\n\nIn the 2015–2016 school year, the district employed 384 teachers. Of those, all had a college degree. For 27.4% of them, their highest degree was a Bachelors. For 71.2% of them, their highest degree was a Masters. For 1.4% of them, their highest degree was a Doctorate. This level of qualification substantially outpaces the rest of the state, where usually only 23.6% of teachers can boast a Masters as their highest degree. A staggering 51% of HPISD teachers have more than 10 years of experience.\n\nIn 2009, the school district was rated \"exemplary\" by the Texas Education Agency.\n\nHPISD and Highland Park High School received national attention in September 2014 for the banning of seven books previously used in high school English studies, after a group of parents protested the contents of these books. The seven books were: \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\" by Garth Stein; \"\" by David K. Shipler; \"Siddhartha\" by Hermann Hesse; \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" by Sherman Alexie; \"An Abundance of Katherines\" by John Green; \"The Glass Castle\" by Jeannette Walls; and \"Song of Solomon\" by Toni Morrison. Superintendent Orr eventually reversed the decision to suspend the books, stating in an email to parents, \"I made the decision in an attempt to de-escalate the conflict, and I readily admit that it had the opposite effect. I take full responsibility for the decision, and I apologize for the disruption it has caused.\" He would retire shortly after the controversy ended.\n\nIn 2015, a $361.4 million bond package passed board approval and a citizens' vote. The package allowed for major renovations to all six existing campuses; the addition of a parking garage at Highland Park Middle School; the addition of new surface parking at Highland Park High School; the demolition of the high school's natatorium; and renovations to the Seay Tennis Center, the Multi-Use Building, and Highlander Stadium. Stantec Inc. and Balfour Beatty Construction were eventually hired to oversee most of the design and construction that ensued. In February 2016, the District sold $225 million in bonds with a 20-year amortization at an interest rate of 2.95%—lower than had been originally expected. Tax rates naturally increased within the District to cover the additional costs.\n\nThe District is run by a seven-member school board of trustees who are elected to three-year terms each May.\nThe school board works with a paid superintendent. From 1914–2017, HPISD has been led by eight superintendents as follows:\nDr. William Buell Irvin served as assistant superintendent from 1944-1945 until taking the job over upon Superintendent Gable's retirement. Dr. Irvin retired in 1954; although he intended to retire earlier (in 1951), the fire at Armstrong Elementary made him feel he should stay on until the school was rebuilt.\n\nThe Victory Apple still continues to this day; at pep rallies on the mornings of football games, the football coaching staff hand out free apples to the players and student body. He retired in 1974 after 20 years of service.\n\nDr. Dawson Orr was known as an articulate, thoughtful and respected leader. He has served as president of the Texas Association of School Administrators (TASA), chairperson of TASA's legislative committee, and president of the Texas Leadership Center Board. He was named Superintendent of the Year by Communities in Schools in 2008 and Key Communicator of the Year by the Texas School Public Relations Association in 2005. He continues to serve as a member of TASA's legislative committee and the Visioning Institute, a study group made up of educational leaders focusing on school district redesign.\n\nDr. Tom Trigg became the eighth and current superintendent for Highland Park Independent School District on June 22, 2015. He replaced Dr. Dawson Orr, who retired after nearly eight years with the district. Dr. Trigg was previously the superintendent of Blue Valley Unified School District in Overland Park, Kansas for 11 years. Dr. Trigg was featured as one of Education Week's 2015 Leaders to Learn From, and he was also named the 2011 Kansas Superintendent of the Year and one of four finalists for the National Superintendent of the Year. Dr. Trigg's contract keeps him with HPISD through June 30, 2022.\n\nIn 2016, the Moody Foundation presented Highland Park ISD with a grant in the amount of $5.8 million to fund Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education in the district. The district named the initiative the Moody Innovation Institute to bring a focus on STEAM education to all students in the district. HPISD hired Dr. Geoffrey Orsak, former Dean of SMU's Lyle School of Engineering, to serve as the Executive Director of the Moody Innovation Institute in March 2017. Currently, plans are in the offing to use part of the funds to create a redesigned internship experience for students at Highland Park High School. Teachers across the District have formed a joint Design Team to implement the Moody Innovation Institute's programs in classrooms.\n\nHPISD offers an elementary school Spanish learning program in each of its four elementary schools. The overall program is called Foreign Language in Elementary Schools (FLES), but since Spanish is the main focus of the FLES program another name is often used: Passport to Spanish. Passport to Spanish begins second-language Spanish instruction for all HPISD students at the Kindergarten level and ensures classes in every grade level following that.\n\nDuring the 2016–2017 school year, Highland Park High School had 27 students named National Merit Semifinalists, its highest number of students to earn the honor in the District's history, dating back to 1958. To be recognized for National Merit Honors, students must take the PSAT, and only 16,000 students out of a pool of more than 1.6 million entrants (1%) are recognized as National Merit Semifinalists.\n\nThe 2017 TEA Accountability Report for HPISD said that every single campus, and thus the District as a whole, had \"Met Standard.\" In fact, the four indexes calculated by the TEA put HPISD far ahead of the state targets: 97 on Student Achievement (target of 60), 50 on Student Progress (target of 22), 68 on Closing Performance Gaps (target of 28), and 94 on Post-secondary Readiness (target of 60). Furthermore, HPISD earned a distinction in post-secondary readiness, making it one of just 58 districts in the state (representing 4.8% of districts) to do so.\n\nDuring the 2016–2017 school year, Highland Park High School won UIL State Championships in tennis, football, boys swimming and diving, girls soccer, and boys golf. More information on the high school's athletics can be found on the Highland Park High School page. The Highland Park Scots football team is the winningest program in Texas high school football history with 802 wins. The Scots have won six football state championships in school history: 1945, 1957, 2005, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nNote: Highland Park Middle School and McCulloch Intermediate School occupy separate wings of the same building. This same building was the original home of the high school in the early 20th century.\n\nNote: A fifth elementary school, in the Dallas city limits on property formerly owned by Northway Christian Church opened in August 2017, but the building will serve as a temporary home to students from the other four elementary schools on a rotational basis until renovations are completed on the other four campuses. Eventually the new elementary school will open as its own school.\n\nIn the 2015–2016 school year, HPISD had a student population of 7,171 people, of whom 2,114 were at Highland Park High School. The areas from which HPISD draws, Highland Park and University Park, have a reputation for being affluent, predominantly white areas. The numbers show that although the student body used to be almost 99% white, by 2015 a lower 86.5% of the district was white. The next biggest sections are a 6% Asian population and a 5% Hispanic population. In terms of affluence, it is true that 0.0% of the district's students are economically disadvantaged. The rate of violent or criminal incidents at every single campus in the district in 2015-2016 was 0.0%. From 1997 to 2016 the number of non-Hispanic white students increased but the district never gained any significant low income population, contrasting with the white flight and increase in low income students in other Dallas County districts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1939093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939093", "title": "Adult animation", "text": "Adult animation\n\nAdult animation, adult cartoon or mature animation, is any type of animated motion work that is mainly targeted towards adults and adolescents, as opposed to children or all-ages audiences. Works in this medium may be considered adult for any number of reasons, such as complex themes, sexual or suggestive content, graphic violence, profane language or dark humor. Works in this genre may explore philosophical, political, or social issues. Some productions are noted for sophisticated and/or experimental storytelling and animation techniques.\n\nIn the United States, before the enforcement of the Hays Code, some cartoon shorts contained humor that was aimed at adult audience members rather than children. Following the introduction of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system, independent animation producers attempted to establish an alternative to mainstream animation. Initially, few animation studios in the United States attempted to produce animation for adult audiences, but later examples of animation produced for adults would gain mainstream attention and success.\n\nThe earliest cartoon series were based upon popular comic strips, and were directed at family audiences. Most animation produced during the silent film era was not intended to be shown to any specific age group, but occasionally contained humor that was directed at adult audience members, including risqué jokes. The assumed audience of these early cartoons, particularly \"Looney Tunes\", has alternated from their initial unspecific audience, to children, and back to general audiences as \"classics\". The earliest known instance of censorship in animation occurred when the censorship board of Pennsylvania requested that references to bootlegging be removed from Walt Disney's 1925 short \"Alice Solves a Puzzle\". One of the earliest animated pornographic films was \"Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure\", produced circa 1928. It has often been suggested that the film was produced for a private party in honor of Winsor McCay. Rumors suggest that the film was developed in Cuba years after it was completed, because no lab in New York City would process the film. When a print was screened in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the program notes attributed the animation to George Stallings, George Canata, Rudy Zamora, Sr. and Walter Lantz.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America, then known as the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association, was established in 1922 as the result of public objection to adult content in films, and a series of guidelines were established, suggesting content that should not be portrayed in films. Until the Hays Code was enforced, many animated shorts featured suggestive content, including sexual innuendo, references to alcohol and drug use, and mild profanity. In the 1933 short \"Bosko's Picture Show\", Bosko appears to use adult words, although it has also been suggested that the character is saying \"fox\", or even \"mug\".\n\nThe Betty Boop series was known for its use of jokes that would eventually be considered taboo following the enforcement of the Hays Code, including the use of nudity. Betty Boop was initially drawn as a dog, and cast as the girlfriend of another Fleischer character, Bimbo. Betty was redesigned as a human, but the series continued to suggest a love relationship between the two that went farther than the normal relationship between humans and their pets. The short \"Is My Palm Read\" contains a scene in which Betty is shown as a child between the ages of four and five, bathing in the nude. In the 1970s, this scene was shown out of context in performances by The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. Concert audiences were not aware that Betty was supposed to be a baby in the sequence.\n\nAnother short, \"Bamboo Isle\", contains a sequence in which Betty dances the hula topless, wearing only a lei over her breasts and a grass skirt. According to animator Shamus Culhane, Fleischer Studios and Paramount Pictures were shocked by the sequence, but because it was a major sequence, it could not be cut out of the film. Culhane also states that he does not remember any instance in which the film was censored. Betty's hula animation was reused for a cameo appearance with Popeye the Sailor in his self-titled animated debut short.\n\nFollowing the enforcement of the Hays Code, Betty's clothing was redesigned, and all future shorts portrayed her with a longer dress which did not portray her physique and sexuality. Shorts produced following the enforcement of the Hays Code were also less surreal in nature, and Betty was portrayed as a rational adult.\n\nBy 1968, the Hays Office had been eliminated, and the former guidelines were replaced by the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The lifting of the Code meant that animated features from other countries could be distributed without censorship, and that censorship would not be required for American productions. Some underground cartoon features from the late 1960s were also aimed at an adult audience, such as \"Bambi Meets Godzilla\" (1968), and the anti-war films \"Escalation\" (1968), and \"Mickey Mouse in Vietnam\" (1969). \"Escalation\" in particular is interesting because it was made by Disney animator Ward Kimball, independently from the Disney Studios. Film producer John Magnuson completed an animated short based upon an audio recording of a comedy routine by Lenny Bruce titled \"Thank You Mask Man\" (1971), in which The Lone Ranger shocks the residents of the town he saves when he tells them that he wants to have sex with Tonto. The short was made by San Francisco-based company Imagination, Inc. and directed by Jeff Hale, a former member of the National Film Board of Canada. The film was scheduled to premiere on the opening night of \"Z\", as a supplement preceding the main feature, but was not shown. According to a former staff member of the festival, Magnuson ran up the aisle and shouted \"They crucified Lenny when he was alive and now that he is dead they are screwing him again!\" The festival's director told Magnuson that the producer of \"Z\" did not want any short shown that night. Rumors suggested that the wife of one of the festival's financiers hated Bruce, and threatened to withdraw her husband's money if the short was screened. \"Thank You Mask Man\" was later shown in art house screenings, and gained a following, but screenings did not perform well enough financially for Magnuson to profit from the film.\n\nBy the late-1960s, animator Ralph Bakshi felt that he could not continue to produce the same kind of animation as he had in the past. Bakshi was quoted in a 1971 article for the \"Los Angeles Times\" as saying that the idea of \"grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous.\" With producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions, establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time.\n\nIn 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and \"Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse\", a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed \"Heavy Traffic\", a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb's \"Fritz the Cat\". Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.\n\n\"Fritz the Cat\" was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. While the film is widely noted in its innovation for featuring content that had not been portrayed in American animation before, such as explicit sexuality and violence, the film also offered commercial potential for alternative and independent animated films in the United States, as the film offered a mature, satirical portrayal of the 1960s, including portrayal of drug use, political tension and race relations. Bakshi has been credited for playing an important role in establishing animation as a medium where any story can be told, rather than a medium for children. As a result of the acceptance of Bakshi's features, the director suggested that \"War and Peace\" could be produced as an animated film.\n\nBecause of the perception that \"Fritz the Cat\" was pornographic, Krantz attempted to appeal the film's rating, but the MPAA refused to hear the appeal. Praise from \"Rolling Stone\" and \"The New York Times\", and the film's acceptance into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival cleared up previous misconceptions. Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with \"Heavy Traffic\". Krantz was nervous about showing too much nudity and sexual content, and had several versions of some scenes animated. Thanks to \"Heavy Traffic\", Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back. Although the film was critically praised, it was banned by the film censorship board in the province of Alberta, Canada when it was originally released.\n\nBakshi's next film, \"Coonskin\" was produced by Albert S. Ruddy. The film, culled from Bakshi's interest in African-American history in America, was an attack on racism and racist stereotypes. Bakshi hired several African-American animators to work on \"Coonskin\" and another feature, \"Hey Good Lookin'\", including Brenda Banks, the first African-American female animator. After the release was stalled by protests from the Congress of Racial Equality, which accused both the film and Bakshi himself of being racist, the film was given limited distribution, advertised as an exploitation film, and soon disappeared from theaters.\n\nBakshi avoided controversy by producing fantasy films, including \"Wizards\", \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"Fire and Ice\". Bakshi did not produce another animated feature film after the 1992 release of \"Cool World\". In 2015, after securing funding through a Kickstarter campaign, he released the short film \"Last Days of Coney Island\" on the internet.\n\nAlthough some adult-oriented animated films achieved success, very few animation studios in the United States produced explicitly adult animation during the 1970s, and much of the adult-oriented animation produced in the 1980s and 1990s was critically and commercially unsuccessful. Krantz produced \"The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat\" without Bakshi's involvement, and it was released in June 1974 to negative reviews. Charles Swenson developed \"Down and Dirty Duck\" as a project for Flo and Eddie (Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, formerly of The Turtles and The Mothers of Invention) under the title \"Cheap!\" The film, produced by Roger Corman, was released on 13 June 1977 under the title \"Dirty Duck\", and received negative reviews.\n\nHowever, in 1987, Italian-Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci, who would later create the television series \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" for Cartoon Network, released a successful short film titled \"Lupo the Butcher\". The short follows the story of a psychotic, temperamental butcher who swears at his meat when the smallest things go wrong. Produced by Marv Newland's International Rocketship Limited, \"Lupo the Butcher\" has become a cult following and opened floodgates to irreverent adult animated series.\n\nAnimated films portraying serious stories began to regain notice from mainstream audiences in the beginning of the 21st century. \"Persepolis\", a 2007 adaptation of Marjane Satrapi's autobiographical graphic novel, won the Jury Prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and was later nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The Iranian government protested the film's inclusion in the Festival, but later allowed the film to be screened in a censored version, which altered the film's sexual content. The 2008 Israeli film \"Waltz with Bashir\", an animated documentary involving the 1982 Lebanon War, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThe 2016 film \"\" was the first film in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series and the first animated Batman film to receive an R rating from the MPAA, with Warner Bros. Animation president Sam Register explaining, \"From the start of production, we encouraged producer Bruce Timm and our team at Warner Bros. Animation to remain faithful to the original story—regardless of the eventual MPAA rating... We felt it was our responsibility to present our core audience—the comics-loving community—with an animated film that authentically represented the tale they know all too well.\" The film was released in a limited theatrical screening on 25 July 2016. \"Sausage Party\", released in 2016, became the first CGI film to be rated R by the MPAA. It grossed over $140 million worldwide, becoming the most successful R-rated animated film of all time. Following the success of \"Sausage Party\", two other adult animated movies, \"Isle of Dogs\" and \"Loving Vincent\", were also released theatrically. In 2019, Sony Pictures Animation announced the creation of an \"Alternative Animation Initiative\" dedicated to producing films aimed at more mature audiences.\n\nIn 1988, San Francisco exhibitor Expanded Cinema screened a compilation of adult-oriented animated shorts under the title \"Outrageous Animation\". Advertising the package as containing \"the wildest cartoons ever\", the screenings contained shorts produced outside the United States, as well as independently produced American shorts. Reviews of the festival were mixed. \"San Francisco Chronicle\" writer Mick LaSalle hated almost everything screened at the festival, with the exception of Bill Plympton's \"One of Those Days\". In \"The San Francisco Examiner\", David Armstrong gave the show a three-star review and described the films screened as having \"some of the rude vitality of the great old Warner Bros. cartoons —and a good deal of the sexual explicitness denied those old favorites from a more cautious age.\"\n\nIn 1990, Mellow Manor Productions began screening films under the title \"Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation\". Founders Craig \"Spike\" Decker and Mike Gribble promoted their festival by handing out flyers on the streets rather than with traditional promotional techniques. In 1991, Decker and Gribble screened their first \"All Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation\", promising \"wild and zany films that could never be shown to our 'normal audience'\". The festival screened newer independent shorts, as well as older shorts such as \"Bambi Meets Godzilla\", and \"Thank You Mask Man\". Although the festival promoted works by animators who would later gain mainstream success, such as Bill Plympton, Mike Judge, Trey Parker and Don Hertzfeldt, many reviewers dismissed the bulk of the programming as shock value.\n\nIn 2003, Judge and Hertzfeldt created a new touring festival of animation marketed towards adults and college students. The Animation Show brought animated shorts into more North American theaters than any previous commercial festival.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1974, Hanna-Barbera produced \"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\", an adult-oriented sitcom in the style of \"All in the Family\". The series dealt with subjects such as feminism and the generation gap.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of animated television programs appeared which challenged the Standards & Practices guidelines, including \"The Simpsons\", \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", \"The Critic\", \"The Brothers Grunt\", \"The Ren and Stimpy Show\", \"Rocko's Modern Life\" and \"Duckman\".\n\n\"The Tracey Ullman Show\", which contained the original Simpson's shorts, aired in prime time, therefore it was not self-censored as much as programs intended to air on Saturday mornings. In addition to the show's portrayal of brief nudity and mild language, the series has dealt with mature themes and subjects such as death, gambling addiction, religion and suicide.\n\nIn 1989, \"The Simpsons\" began airing on Fox Broadcasting Company in prime time, becoming a massive hit among American audiences. In response, ABC, CBS and NBC each developed animated series to air in prime time, but none of the shows were successful. One series, \"Capitol Critters\", focused on subjects such as gun control, interracial violence and political corruption. In his review of the series, \"Variety\" critic Brian Lowry wrote that he felt that the series' approach was \"muddled\", and that \"the bland central character and cartoonish elements [...] will likely be off-putting to many adults, who won't find the political satire biting enough to merit their continued attention. Similarly, kids probably won't be as smitten with the cartoon aspects or look\". The series was cancelled after one month. \"The Critic\" was somewhat more successful, but achieved low ratings because of ABC's sporadic scheduling, and was cancelled by the network. Fox picked up the series, but cancelled it four months later. While Fox allowed \"The Simpsons\" to portray animated depictions of human buttocks, ABC would not allow similar scenes to appear on \"The Critic\".\n\n\"Beavis and Butt-Head\" was controversial for its portrayal of brief nudity, profanity and violence. Although the series was intended for adult audiences, it was shown in the afternoons, and multiple parents claimed that their children had imitated the show's characters. The first instance of such an accusation occurred when animal lovers in Santa Cruz, California claimed that someone had blown up a cat after seeing Beavis and Butt-head perform this act on television. In actuality, no such scene had ever been portrayed. When a five-year-old boy in Ohio set his bed on fire, killing his two-year-old sister, critics claimed that the incident was the result of an episode involving fire, although it has never been proven that the boy had ever watched the series. MTV responded by moving the series to a later airtime and adding disclaimers to future episodes stating explicitly not to imitate the actions of the characters, as well as removing all references to fire from the episodes.\n\nDiscussions involving a series based upon Trey Parker and Matt Stone's video Christmas card, \"The Spirit of Christmas\", led HBO to contact Ralph Bakshi in order to produce an animated series targeted specifically toward adults. Bakshi enlisted a team of writers, including his son, Preston, to develop \"Spicy Detective\", later renamed \"Spicy City\", an anthology series set in a noir-ish, technology-driven future. Each episode featuring a different story narrated by a female host named Raven, voiced by Michelle Phillips. The series premiered in July 1997, unexpectedly beating \"South Park\" to television by over a month and becoming the first \"adults only\" cartoon series. Although critical reaction was mixed and largely unfavorable, \"Spicy City\" received acceptable ratings. A second season was approved, but the network wanted to fire Bakshi's writing team and hire professional Los Angeles screenwriters. When Bakshi refused to cooperate with the network, the series was canceled.\n\nIn 1999, Family Guy debuted on Fox for the first time. Within the first three years of its lifespan, Family Guy had been cancelled by the network twice; since it continues to be one of Fox's most recognizable programs and continues to air to this day. \n\nIn 2001, Time Warner established Adult Swim as a programming block on Cartoon Network, aimed for an adult audience, in contrast to the different demographic targeted for Cartoon Network. Its schedule currently includes original programs such as \"Rick and Morty\" and \"The Venture Bros.\", as well as more \"experimental\" shows such as \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force and\" \"Squidbillies\". \n\nAmerican audiences have become more accepting of adult-oriented animation through the popularity of American-produced comedic television shows. Other adult cartoons include \" Futurama\", \"King of the Hill\", \"The Boondocks\", \"American Dad!\", \"Bob's Burgers\", \"BoJack Horseman\", and \"Archer\".\nDramatic series such as \"Aeon Flux\" and \"Invasion America\" are less common, and still rarely successful.\n\nIn 1954, a British film studio produced an animated adaptation of George Orwell's novel \"Animal Farm\". This film is believed to have been one of the earliest examples of British animation, and like the book is meant to be a portrayal or critique of Stalinism with characters serving as analogues to figures from the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nFor many years, it had been problematic to import films that did not meet the approval of the United States Customs Service. In 1972, the Customs Service refused entry of a short film titled \"Sinderella\", depicting scenes of sexual intercourse between characters based upon \"Cinderella\", \"Little Red Riding Hood\", \"Puss in Boots\", \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\" and \"Prince Charming\". The film was seized as obscene material, and its distributor filed a court case and an appeal in 1974, but lost both.\n\nIn 1973, Rene Laloux directed \"La Planète sauvage\" based on the French science fiction novel \"Oms en série\" by Stefan Wul. It has been televised in the United States and United Kingdom as \"Fantastic Planet\", and several DVD editions have been released. Also in 1973, an Italian film, \"King Dick\", was released and became a cult classic in the United Kingdom. A West German short called \"Snow White and the Seven Perverts\" (\"\"Schneeflittchen unter die Sieben Bergen\"\"), produced by Love Film, also appeared. This little film mostly parodies Snow White and has been included as part of other compilation films.\n\nThe first foreign animated feature to receive both an X rating and wide distribution in the United States was \"\". A dubbed version, which featured new dialogue performed by American actors and comedians such as John Belushi, Adolph Caesar, Brian Doyle-Murray, Judy Graubart, Bill Murray and Johnny Weissmuller Jr., received an R rating. According to distributor Stuart S. Shapiro, the X rating hurt the film's distribution, but the dubbed version \"took the bite out of the film. It lost its outrageousness.\" \"Tarzoon\" was banned by the New Zealand Board of Censors in 1980.\n\nIn England, Martin Rosen directed two animated features based on the novels of Richard Adams: \"Watership Down\" in 1978, and \"The Plague Dogs\" in 1982. Both films deal with adult themes: \"Watership Down\", the negotiation of leadership to organize an exodus away from persecution, and \"The Plague Dogs\" on animal testing.\n\n\"Pink Floyd – The Wall\", an adaptation of Pink Floyd's concept album of the same name, featured fifteen minutes of painstaking traditional animation in addition to numerous live-action sequences; although the film was not by any stretch pornographic, it was an adult film (with numerous references to drugs, mental illness and sex, along with dark or disturbing animated sequences (directed by British cartoonist, Gerald Scarfe) such as portraying one character talking out of his rectum and having a scrotum for a beard) and received an R rating when imported to the United States.\nIn 1986, England produced yet another politically-themed animation, \"When the Wind Blows\", about an elderly couple whose home undergoes a nuclear attack.\n\n\"Werner\" - a German animated film based on the comic book. In an episode of many characters use profanity and flip the bird.\n\n\"Felidae\" is a 1994 German animated neo-noir crime film based on Akif Pirinçci's 1989 novel of the same name. It features graphic violent and sexual content involving animals.\n\nSoyuzmultfilm produced children's animation as well as animations aimed more at adults, such as Film, Film, Film, a satirical animation about the film industry in the Soviet Union, and Pomorskaya Byl, a serious account of the death of two Pomor fishermen, stranded in the middle of the White Sea.\n\nAdult animation is known in Japan as . In both English and Japanese, the word \"adult\" may carry connotations of a sexual nature, but anime on serious topics such as \"Akira\" or \"Ghost in the Shell\" are often referred to as \"adult\" in Japan as well, even when sex is not a key part of the story.\n\nAnimated works of an erotic nature have come to be described in western fandom as \"hentai\", the Japanese word for \"perverted\", while in Japan they are more likely to be referred to as or . Although some associate all anime with sexual content, hentai only makes up a very small portion of the Japanese animation industry. As the result of the misconceptions about Japanese animation, some video stores outside Japan have classified children's anime as for adults only. Many video stores have also categorized all adult-oriented animation as anime, including the works of Ralph Bakshi, the French animated film \"Fantastic Planet\", the Canadian animated film \"Heavy Metal\" and the HBO television series \"Todd McFarlane's Spawn\". In the case of \"Spawn\", Todd McFarlane directly listed anime as an influence, particularly Katsuhiro Otomo's \"Akira\", and stated his hope that the show would help encourage the rise of adult animation on North American networks. This in part lead to the involvement of the Japanese studio Madhouse in the production, in an attempt to \"combine\" the Eastern and Western styles.\nSome of the earliest manga magazines were aimed at adults, and this provided a prime source as the basis for adult anime works. \"Weekly Manga Times\" began publication in 1956, and would be followed by \"Weekly Manga Goraku\" (1964), and \"Manga Action\" (1967). Anime works based on adult manga include \"Berserk\", \"Hellsing Ultimate\", \"Maison Ikkoku\", \"Mushishi\", \"Golden Boy\" and \"Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari\".\nIn 1969, Osamu Tezuka and Eiichi Yamamoto released \"Senya Ichiya Monogatari\" (千夜一夜物語) the first of a series of three animated feature films aimed at an adult audience. It was dubbed and released in the United States as \"One Thousand and One Arabian Nights\". Osamu Tezuka and Eiichi Yamamoto collaborated on the second film in the Animerama series \"Kureopatora\" (クレオパトラ) released in the United States as \"Cleopatra: Queen of Sex\". The third film \"Kanashimi no Beradonna\" (哀しみのベラドンナ) was directed by Eiichi Yamamoto alone. It was entered in the Berlin International Film Festival, but did not achieve commercial success. In addition, mockbusters: Maruhi Gekiga, Ukiyoe Senichiya (, The first animated film to receive the R-18 in Japan), Do It! Yasuji's Pornorama (, based on the erotic gag manga by ) was released, but did not achieve commercial success either.\nIn 1984, original video animation (OVA) of an erotic nature began to be released, first \"Lolita Anime\" by Wonder Kids based on the manga work of , and then later in the year \"Cream Lemon\", a series which proved to be a big hit in Japan. \"La Blue Girl\" and \"New Angel\" are two other erotic anime to be released in United States and Europe in the early 1990s.\n\n1988 saw the release of \"Akira\" directed by Katsuhiro Otomo which was dubbed and shown in North American theaters, and released on VHS around the world. Its success led to a greater interest in Japanese adult anime in the US, and opened the door for other titles. In 1995, \"Ghost in the Shell\" was released as a feature film, directed by Mamoru Oshii based on the manga by Masamune Shirow. It received critical acclaim in both Japan, and abroad hinting further at the possibilities of adult animation.\nThe North American Adult Swim channel has been airing adult-oriented anime series via Toonami on Saturday nights: \"Cowboy Bebop\", \"FLCL\", \"\", \"IGPX\" and \"Space Dandy\". Four of the Japanese TV networks have similar late night anime blocks: Fuji Television's \"Noitamina\", Mainichi Broadcasting System's \"Animeism and Anime Shower\", Asahi Broadcasting Corporation's \"Wednesday Anime\" and Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation's \"Manpa\". The programs aired have included \"Angel Heart\", \"Genji Monogatari Sennenki\" and \"Hellsing\".\n\nStarting in 2004, Mahiro Maeda directed a multi-episode anime adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' novel as \"\". It was aired on Animax in Asia, and Geneon Entertainment in the United States, and received critical acclaim in the anime press.\n\n\n"}

It is located about 15 km east of the Adelaide city centre in South Australia, and has panoramic views of the city and the Adelaide plains to the west, and of the Picadilly Valley to the east.\n\nThe summit can be accessed by road from the South Eastern Freeway at Crafers, and from the eastern suburbs via Greenhill Road and the Mount Lofty Scenic Route. The more enthusiastic can walk up the gully from Waterfall Gully, through the Cleland Conservation Park and from Chambers Gully. The track from Waterfall Gully to the summit is a 4 km uphill trek and one of Adelaide's most popular exercise circuits so the carpark at the bottom is often busy. The summit provides panoramic views across Adelaide, and a cafe-restaurant and gift shop. These are relatively new due to protracted disputes over appropriate development following the destruction of the old cafe in the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires. Kangaroos are often spotted on the trails leading up to the summit cafe.\n\nOn the ridge near the summit are three television transmission towers (the northernmost being that of the ABC), and the Mount Lofty Fire Tower operated by the Country Fire Service.\n\nThe summit has become a popular spot for tourists to Adelaide, and also for cyclists coming up the old Mount Barker Road through Eagle on the Hill; this former section of National Highway No.1 has been superseded by the Heysen Tunnels.\n\nMount Lofty was named by Matthew Flinders on 23 March 1802 during his circumnavigation of the Australian continent.\nIt was first climbed by a European when the explorer Collet Barker climbed it in April 1831, almost six years before Adelaide was settled.\n\nA stone cairn at the summit was originally used to mark the trig point, and in 1885 this was replaced by an obelisk which served as the central reference point for surveying purposes across Adelaide. In 1902 the obelisk was rededicated and renamed as the \"Flinders Column\".\n\nThe Summit was closed to the public during the Second World War, when the obelisk was considered an indispensable navigation aid. A flashing strobe was fitted to the top to improve visibility at night. This strobe was removed after the war, but then re-installed in the 1990s, when the obelisk was repainted and restored during construction of the new kiosk.\n\nSummit Road, Mt Lofty, was one of the best-known addresses in South Australia, with the summer houses of several prominent families being located there. These were all destroyed or severely damaged by the Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983, but have subsequently been restored. They include:\n\n\nOther buildings, such as \"St. Michael's Monastery\" (an Anglican church retreat) and \"Arthur's Seat\", for a time known as Stawell School, a private school for girls, were never rebuilt. Part of this property was excised for the ABC-TV transmitter building and mast.\n\nNote that historically, \"Mount Lofty\" addresses frequently referred to the area now known as Crafers and to parts of Stirling.\n\nDue to Adelaide's mild winters, temperatures cold enough to produce snow in the Adelaide metropolitan area never occur, and the nearest snowfields to Adelaide are in eastern Victoria, over 700 km away. However, light snowfalls (rarely lasting for more than a day) are not uncommon on the summit (although it is possible for Mount Lofty to go two or three years without any snowfall.) This is a huge novelty for the approximately 1.4 million residents of the Adelaide Plains, (particularly for the children), and a photograph of the event has made the front page of the local newspaper multiple times in the past. Mount Lofty is the coldest location in the Adelaide area; during winter months the temperature may not exceed 3-4 °C on some days. The summit is the most common location for snow in South Australia; rare snowfalls sometimes occur in other parts of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and occasionally further north, in the Flinders and Gammon Ranges.\n\n\n"}

Shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed, between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft.\n\nThe simplest shuttles, known as \"stick shuttles\", are made from a flat, narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the weft yarn. More complicated shuttles incorporate bobbins or pirns.\n\nIn the United States, shuttles are often made of wood from the flowering dogwood, because it is hard, resists splintering, and can be polished to a very smooth finish.\n\nShuttles were originally passed back and forth by hand. However, John Kay invented a loom in 1733 that incorporated a flying shuttle. This shuttle could be thrown through the warp, which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler. Though air-jet and water-jet looms are common in large operations, many companies still use flying shuttle looms. This is due in large part to their being easier to maintain than the more modern looms. In modern flying shuttle looms, the shuttle itself is made of rounded steel, with a hook in the back which carries the filler, or \"pick.\"\n\nThe act of \"kissing the shuttle\", in which weavers used their mouths to pull thread through the eye of a shuttle when the pirn was replaced, contributed to the spread of disease.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1939133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939133", "title": "Medieval reenactment", "text": "Medieval reenactment\n\nMedieval reenactment is a form of historical reenactment that focuses on re-enacting European history in the period from the fall of Rome to about the end of the 15th century. The second half of this period is often called the Middle Ages. This multiplicity of terms is compounded by the variety of other terms used for the period.\n\nThe first period is sometimes called the Migration Period or Dark Ages by Western European historians, and as Völkerwanderung (\"wandering of the peoples\") by German historians. This term is usually reserved for the 5th and 6th centuries. Re-enactors who re-create the next period of history - 7th to 11th centuries - often refer to this as Early medieval. The 12th to 14th centuries fall under the term High medieval, while the 15th century is often termed Late medieval.\n\nWith such a wide range of eras most medieval reenactment groups focus on a smaller time period, sometimes restricting their interest to a particular century, or even a specific decade, series of battles, or monarch, depending on how authentic the reenactment and encampment is intended to be.\n\nMedieval period oriented living history groups and reenactors focus on recreating civilian or military life in period of the Middle Ages. It is very popular in Eastern Europe. The goal of the reenactor and their group is to portray an accurate interpretation of a person who credibly could exist at a specific place at a specific point in time while at the same time remaining approachable to the public. Examples of living history activities include authentic camping, cooking, practicing historical skills and trades, and playing historical musical instruments or board games.\n\nRenaissance Fair participants generally borrow from a range of history and often incorporate fantasy or Hollywood-inspired elements into a presentation for public entertainment. In contrast, activities of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) include everything from artistic disguises for modern items such as ice chests, to exhaustive research and authentic living history events.\n\nThe principal aim of this sort of reenactment is to re-create historical battles or methods of combat. The variations range from training of historical dueling practices (usually with an appropriate period sword such as an arming sword or rapier and wrestling as a martial art), to reenactment of historical or legendary battles of the medieval period.\n\nSome groups treating historical combat as a martial art do not fit the traditional definition of a reenactment group and are more similar to fencing clubs. An example is the SCA, which uses rattan swords to avoid injury. Others combine the sport with more traditional forms of reenactment, such as living history. It is usual to fight using more restricted target areas than in a real fight and with less speed and force, although some systems try to get as close to real combat as possible. \nMany societies try to reenact actual battles on or near the battle site. These events are usually open to the public to watch. Other societies such as the SCA hire venues for private events, including combat, without any public present. \n\nThe Federation of the Wars of the Roses is a British–based society which specialises in reenactments of the 15th Century. It stages events at historical sites all over Britain, including those on or near actual battle sites. There are rules on weapons, clothing and armour which are observed by the Households that are Federation members. New Households wishing to enter the Federation are sponsored by established ones, and endure a probationary period to ensure standards are observed.\n\nThere have been many isolated examples of medieval reenactment in Europe, notably the Eglinton Tournament of 1839. In modern times, medieval reenactment has been popular in the United Kingdom, starting in the late 1960s and growing every year since, with groups from all over England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales participating in events. Many UK battles are reenacted at their original battle sites by enthusiasts with a high degree of authenticity, together with Medieval traders, musicians, caterers. UK reenactors can be seen throughout the country during the summer months at battles, fairs, carnivals, fetes, pubs and schools. Almost entirely throughout the UK, reenactors use blunted steel weapons for reenactments and rubber tipped arrows (blunts) for archers, or steel heads when target shooting. The largest early medieval event in the UK is the Battle of Hastings reenactment, which in 2006 had over 3600 registered participants and combined living history and combat reenactment. Most UK battles have at some point been reenacted such as the Battle of Lewes and the Battle of Evesham, many historical battles are reenacted annually from periods such as the Wars of the Roses, including the Battle of Bosworth Field and the Battle of Tewkesbury. Others are carried out at irregular intervals depending on the site availability and funding for the event, such as the Battle of Bannockburn. \n\nBelgium has at least two dozen separate groups of medieval reenactors, including the Order of the Hagelanders, the Gentsche Ghesellen and the Gruuthuse Household serving Lewis de Bruges, lord of Gruuthuse.\n\nThe open air museum Middelaldercentret uses living history and historical reenactment to portrait a part of a small Danish merchant town. Several reenactment groups exists in Denmark which are doing medieval reenactment at markets around the country.\n\nIn France there is an annual reenactment of the Battle of Agincourt representing a battle of the Hundred Years War.\n\nIn Germany medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance faires and festivals as e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in Bretten. or the Schloss Kaltenberg knights tournament.In the past few years combat reenactment has gained some ground as well. A few groups are training historical combat such as longsword dueling and dussack fighting at universities, but the majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity (some groups refuse to fight groups representing different or wider periods, even if the combat practices would be entirely compatible otherwise). In general, the specific German approach of Authenticity (reenactment) is less about replaying a certain event, but to allow an immersion in a certain era. Historic city festivals and events are quite important to build up local communities and contribute to the self-image of municipalities. Events in monuments or on historical sites are less about the events related to them but as mere staffage for the immersion experience.\n\nAmong many battlefield reenactors in Germany, the Codex Belli has become a de facto standard.\n\nGroups from Central Europe, especially Hungary, are rumored to practice much more dangerous forms of battlefield reenactment, sometimes with sharp edges and points as well as metal arrow heads and an overall higher acceptance of the risk of injury posed by these dangers. This more risky, although more realistic, form of reenactment is apparently also practiced in former East Germany.\n\nIn Poland, the Battle of Grunwald reenactment every year on 15 July is the best known and attracts participants and visitors from many other countries. It is associated with living history and a medieval fair.\n\nIn Sweden there are many different \"medieval markets\". The largest is the one in Gotland.\nIn Szeklerland, Transylvania are many Hun, szekler knight, early Hungarian and hussar reenactment groups and camps.\nOne of those is the Szekler knights (Lofos) reenactment group in Torboszlo.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also known as the only survivor of the 1957 plane crash that killed the President of the Philippines, Ramon Magsaysay, and 24 others.\n\nNestor Mata graduated from the University of Santo Tomas where he obtained a degree in philosophy and letter. He has also had masteral studies on foreign affairs.\n\nMata worked with a government radio station before becoming a reporter with the \"Philippine Herald\" newspaper and covered the Korean War as a war correspondent. He covered topics which involved politics and foreign affairs. In 1953, he was assigned by his newspaper to cover the then-newly elected President Magsaysay.\n\nOn March 16, 1957, President Magsaysay, accompanied by several government officials and journalists, flew to Cebu for a speaking engagement. Later that evening, the presidential party took off for the return flight to Manila. Their plane crashed in Mount Manung-gal in Cebu at around 1:16 a.m, March 17, 1957.\n\nMata had been seated near the presidential compartment and was half-asleep at the time of the crash. He was initially rendered unconscious after the crash, and came to a few hours later. Mata later recounted: \nI found myself on the side of a steep cliff among dried bushes…. Agonizing with pain, I was completely at a loss what to do. About three meters away from me were parts of the plane. They were still burning. Meanwhile, I heard the distant howling of a dog. It was only then that I felt hopeful of being rescued. Thinking that there were probably people living not far away from where I lay moaning with pain, I made an effort to shout. I noticed that my voice echoed in the nearby mountains.\n\nAfter that, I began shouting, \"Mr. President! Mr. President! Mr. President!\" When no answer came, I shouted for Pablo Bautista, the reporter of the Liwayway magazine. \"Pabling! Pabling!\" Still no answer. It began to dawn on me that there was no other survivor except me.\nMata was rescued by Marcelino Nuya and several other farmers residing near the crash site. He suffered second and third degree burns all over his body and would be hospitalized for the next six months. It took eighteen hours to transport the injured Mata down the mountain. Upon his arrival at a Cebu City hospital, Mata was able to dictate through a nurse a press dispatch to his newspaper. It began with the sentence \"President Magsaysay is dead.\"\n\nTogether with Vicente Villafranca, Mata penned \"One Came Back\" (1957), a memoir detailing the last moments of President Magsaysay and his own ordeal after surviving the plane crash.\n\nAfter surviving the crash, Mata continued writing for the \"Philippine Herald\" until it was closed down in 1972 following the declaration of Martial Law by then-President Ferdinand Marcos. He then served with \"The Daily Express\" until Marcos' ouster during the People Power Revolution of 1986.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1999, Mata penned as a regular newspaper column for the \"Manila Standard\" and from 1999 until his death wrote for the \"Malaya\". He also acted as a co-executive editor for the magazine \"Lifestyle Asia\" from 1986 to 1999.\n\nMata worked as an associate professor who taught subjects on politics such as the creation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and talks on resolving the North Borneo dispute. He taught until 1972.\n\nHe was also involved in chess having won executive chess events in the 1970s. He also became a board member of the now-defunct Philippine Chess Federation and led the Philippine delegation to the Chess Olympiad in 1994 in Moscow, Russia.\n\nMata died in April 12, 2018 at the Cardinal Santos Memorial Hospital in San Juan, Metro Manila.\n\nMata had five children.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939142", "title": "Prasugrel", "text": "Prasugrel\n\nPrasugrel (trade name Effient in the US, Australia and India, and Efient in the EU) is a drug used to prevent formation of blood clots. It is a platelet inhibitor and an irreversible antagonist of P2Y ADP receptors and is of the thienopyridine drug class. It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Co. and produced by Ube and currently marketed in the United States in cooperation with Eli Lilly and Company.\n\nPrasugrel was approved for use in Europe in February 2009, and in the US in July 2009, for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in people with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\n\nPrasugrel is used in combination with low dose aspirin to prevent thrombosis in patients with ACS, including unstable angina pectoris, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), who are planned for treatment with PCI. Prasugrel is associated with a higher bleeding risk compared to clopidogrel but has demonstrated superiority in reducing the composite endpoint of death, recurrent myocardial infarctions and stroke. \nPrasugrel does not change the risk of death when given to people who have had a STEMI or NSTEMI. \n\nGiven the risk of bleeding, prasugrel should not be used in patients who are older than 75years old, of low body weight or has a history of transient ischemic attacks or strokes. The initiation of prasugrel before coronary angiography outside the context of primary PCI is not recommended.\n\nPrasugrel should not be given to patients with active pathological bleeding, such as peptic ulcer or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, because of higher risk of stroke (thrombotic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage).\n\nAdverse effects include:\n\nPrasugrel has a low potential for interactions. It may, for example, be used with proton pump inhibitors to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding without loss of its antiplatelet effect.\n\nPrasugrel is a member of the thienopyridine class of ADP receptor inhibitors, like ticlopidine (trade name Ticlid) and clopidogrel (trade name Plavix). These agents reduce the aggregation (\"clumping\") of platelets by irreversibly binding to P2Y receptors. Prasugrel inhibits platelet aggregation more rapidly, more consistently, and to a greater extent than clopidogrel\n\nClopidogrel, unlike prasugrel, was issued a black box warning from the FDA on March 12, 2010, as the estimated 2–14% of the US population who have low levels of the CYP2C19 liver enzyme needed to activate clopidogrel may not get the full effect. Tests are available to predict if a patient would be susceptible to this problem or not.\nUnlike clopidogrel, prasugrel is effective in most individual with the exception in patients over the age of 75, weight under 60 kg, and patients with a history of stroke or TIA due to increased risk of bleeding, although several cases have been reported of decreased responsiveness to prasugrel. It has been suggested that the decreased responsiveness observed in prasugrel is likely due to its low but significant frequency of High Platelet Reactivity (HPR).\n\nPrasugrel produces inhibition of platelet aggregation to 20 μM or 5 μM ADP, as measured by light transmission aggregometry. Following a 60-mg loading dose of the drug, about 90% of patients had at least 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation by one hour. Maximum platelet inhibition was about 80%. Mean steady-state inhibition of platelet aggregation was about 70% following three to five days of dosing at 10 mg daily after a 60-mg loading dose.\nPlatelet aggregation gradually returns to baseline values over five to 9 days after discontinuation of prasugrel, this time course being a reflection of new platelet production rather than pharmacokinetics of prasugrel. Discontinuing clopidogrel 75 mg and initiating prasugrel 10 mg with the next dose resulted in increased inhibition of platelet aggregation, but not greater than that typically produced by a 10-mg maintenance dose of prasugrel alone. Increasing platelet inhibition could increase bleeding risk. The relationship between inhibition of platelet aggregation and clinical activity has not been established.\n\nPrasugrel is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolized by carboxylesterase 2 in the intestine and carboxylesterase 1 in the liver to a likewise inactive thiolactone, which is then converted by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, and to a minor extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, to a pharmacologically active metabolite (R-138727). R-138727 has an elimination half-life of about 7 hours (range 2 h to 15 h). Healthy subjects, patients with stable atherosclerosis, and patients undergoing PCI show similar pharmacokinetics.\n\nPrasugrel has one chiral atom. It is used in racemic form as the hydrochloride salt, which is a white powder.\n\n"}

It has consisted of vocalist and guitarist Hiroji Miyamoto, guitarist Toshiyuki Ishimori, bassist Seiji Takamidori and drummer Yoshiyuki Tominaga since 1986.\n\nIn 2007, \"Rolling Stone Japan\" ranked their album \"The Elephant Kashimashi II\" number 50 on a list of the greatest Japanese rock albums of all time.\n\nElephant Kashimashi was formed in 1981 by Akabanedai Junior High School classmates Toshiyuki Ishimori and Yoshiyuki Tominaga on guitar and drums respectively. Vocalist and guitarist Hiroji Miyamoto joined in their third year of junior high, and they covered songs by bands such as Deep Purple, Rainbow and RC Succession. They participated in the amateur music competition EastWest put on by Nippon Gakki (Yamaha Corporation) playing original songs. In 1986, Tominaga's high school classmate Seiji Takamidori joined on bass completing the final line up that continues to this day. In December of that year they won the CBS Sony SD audition.\nElephant Kashimashi made their debut on March 21, 1988 with the simultaneous Epic/Sony Records release of the single \"Dede\" and their self-titled album. Their second album, \"The Elephant Kashimashi II\", followed in November of that same year. The band held a concert at Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall in 1990 and it has become a tradition, with them having performed there every year since. Following several albums with disappointing sales, their contract with Epic/Sony ended after their seventh album \"Tokyo no Sora\" in May 1994.\n\nIn 1996, Elephant Kashimashi signed with Pony Canyon and released the single \"Kanashimi no Hate\" in April and the album \"Kokoro ni Hana wo\" in August. Their 1997 album \"Asu ni Mukatte Hashire -Tsukiyo no Uta-\" was a big success with half a million copies sold, thanks to the single \"Koyoi no Tsuki no Yoni\" being used as the theme song of the TV drama \"Tsuki no Kagayaku Yoru Dakara\".\n\nAfter one more album with Pony Canyon, the band moved to Toshiba EMI in 1999.\n\nIn March 2006, Tominaga underwent surgery for a chronic subdural hematoma.\n\nElephant Kashimashi switched record labels to Universal Music in 2007, and released the single \"Oretachi no Ashita\" on November 21. The album \"Starting Over\" followed on January 30, 2008. \"Kizuna\", released as a single on March 18, 2009, became the band's first song to be used as the theme of a film when it was selected for \"Kanshiki Yonezawa Mamoru no Jikenbo\". The album \"Noboreru Taiyō\" was released on April 29, and its tour ran from May 14 to June 3. \n\nOn September 1, 2012, Miyamoto had acute hearing loss in his left ear and underwent surgery. As a result live activities were suspended for a year until September 14, 2013, when they held a special concert.\n\nAt the 2018 Space Shower Music Awards, Elephant Kashimashi were given the Best Respect Artist award for their influence and achievements in music. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of their debut, Elephant Kashimashi held their first nationwide tour that covered every prefecture in Japan. It finished with a special concert at Saitama Super Arena where they were supported by Mr. Children and Spitz. Their album \"Wake Up\" was released on June 6, 2018 and went on to become a winner at the 11th CD Shop Awards. On November 16, 2018, Akabane Station began playing Elephant Kashimashi songs as departure melodies in hopes to revitalize the area. Three of the band's four members are from Akabane.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1939171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939171", "title": "African Burial Ground National Monument", "text": "African Burial Ground National Monument\n\nAfrican Burial Ground National Monument is a monument at Duane Street and African Burial Ground Way (Elk Street) in the Civic Center section of Lower Manhattan, New York City. Its main building is the Ted Weiss Federal Building at 290 Broadway. The site contains the remains of more than 419 Africans buried during the late 17th and 18th centuries in a portion of what was the largest colonial-era cemetery for people of African descent, some free, most enslaved. Historians estimate there may have been as many as 10,000–20,000 burials in what was called the \"Negroes Burial Ground\" in the 1700s. The five to six acre site's excavation and study was called \"the most important historic urban archaeological project in the United States.\" The Burial Ground site is New York's earliest known African-American \"cemetery\"; studies show an estimated 15,000 African American people were buried here.\n\nThe discovery highlighted the forgotten history of enslaved Africans in colonial and federal New York City, who were integral to its development. By the American Revolutionary War, they constituted nearly a quarter of the population in the city. New York had the second-largest number of enslaved Africans in the nation after Charleston, South Carolina. Scholars and African-American civic activists joined to publicize the importance of the site and lobby for its preservation. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993 and a National Monument in 2006 by President George W. Bush.\n\nIn 2003 Congress appropriated funds for a memorial at the site and directed redesign of the federal courthouse to allow for this. A design competition attracted more than 60 proposals for a design. The memorial was dedicated in 2007 to commemorate the role of Africans and African Americans in colonial and federal New York City, and in United States history. Several pieces of public art were also commissioned for the site. A visitor center opened in 2010 to provide interpretation of the site and African-American history in New York.\n\nSlavery in the New York City area was introduced by the Dutch West India Company in New Netherland in about 1626 with the arrival of Paul D'Angola, Simon Congo, Lewis Guinea, Jan Guinea, Ascento Angola, and six other men. Their names denote their place of origin: Angola, the Congo, and Guinea. Two years after their arrival three female Angolan slaves arrived. These two groups heralded the beginning of slavery in what would become New York City, and which would continue for two hundred years. The first slave auction in the city took place in 1655 at Pearl Street and Wall Street - then on the East River. Although the Dutch imported Africans as slaves, it was possible for some to gain freedom or \"half-freedom\" during the time of Dutch rule. In 1643, Paul D'Angola and his companions petitioned the Dutch West India Company for their freedom. Their request was granted, resulting in their acquisition of land on which to build their own houses and farm. By the mid-17th century, farms of free blacks covered 130 acres where Washington Square Park later appeared. Even slaves in full bondage were granted certain rights and afforded protections such as the prohibition against arbitrary physical punishment – for example, whipping.\n\nAfter the English took over New Amsterdam in 1664, they changed the name to New York (after the Duke of York) and changed the rules governing slavery in the colony. Some 40 percent of the small population was in bondage. The new slavery rules were more harsh and restrictive than those of the Dutch, and rescinded many of the former rights and protections of slaves, such as the prohibition against arbitrary physical punishment. In 1697 Trinity Church gained control of the burial grounds in the city and passed an ordinance excluding blacks from the right to be buried in churchyards. When Trinity took control of the municipal burial ground, now its northern graveyard, it barred Africans from interment within the city limits. Through much of the 18th century, the African burying ground was beyond the northern boundary of the city, which was just beyond what is today Chambers Street.\n\nAs the city population increased, so did the number of residents who held slaves. \"In 1703, 42 percent of New York's households had slaves, much more than Philadelphia and Boston combined.\" Most slaveholding households had only a few slaves, used primarily for domestic work. By the 1740s, 20 percent of the population of New York were slaves, totaling about 2,500 people. Slaves also worked as skilled artisans and craftsmen associated with shipping, construction, and other trades, as well as laborers. \"On the eve of the American Revolution, New York City had the largest number of enslaved Africans of any English colonial settlement except Charleston, South Carolina, and it had the highest proportion of slaves to Europeans of any northern settlement.\" Africans had become essential to the development of New York.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, the British occupied New York City in the summer of 1776 and they kept control until after the war ended and they departed on Evacuation Day: November 25, 1783. As in the other rebellious American colonies, the British had offered freedom to slaves who left rebel masters; this was done in part to cause economic damage to the rebel Americans. These individuals were listed in the \"Book of Negroes\". This promise of freedom attracted thousands of slaves to the city who escaped to British lines. In 1781 the New York legislature offered a financial incentive to slaveholders who assigned their slaves to military service, and promised freedom at war's end for the slaves.\n\nBy 1780 the African and African-descendant community swelled to about 10,000 in British-occupied New York City, which became the center of free blacks in North America. Among those who escaped to New York were Deborah Squash and her husband Harvey, who fled from George Washington's plantation in Virginia. After the end of the war, according to provisions concerning property in the Treaty of Paris, the Americans demanded the return of all former slaves under British control. The British refused the American request and evacuated 3,000 freedmen with their troops in 1783 for resettlement in Nova Scotia, other British colonies, and England. Other freedmen scattered from the city to evade slave catchers.\n\nAided by individual manumissions after war's end, by 1790 about one-third of the blacks in the city were free. The total city population was 33,131, according to the first national census.\n\nIn 1799 the state legislature passed \"An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery\" with little opposition. Similar to Pennsylvania's law, it provided for gradual manumission of slaves. Children born to slave mothers after July 4, 1799, were considered legally free, but had to serve as indentured servants to their mother's master, until age 28 for men and 25 for women, before gaining social freedom. Until reaching age 21, they were considered the property of the mother's master. All slaves already in bondage before July 4, 1799, remained slaves for life, although they were reclassified as \"indentured servants.\"\n\nIn 1817, the New York legislature granted freedom to all children born to slaves after July 4, 1799, with total abolition of slavery to take effect on July 4, 1827. On this date, known as Emancipation Day, more than 10,000 slaves were freed in New York State with no financial compensation to their former owners. Blacks paraded in New York City to celebrate.\n\nUnder the 1777 New York constitution, all free men had to satisfy a property requirement to vote, which eliminated poorer men from voting, both blacks and whites. A new constitution in 1821 eliminated the property requirement for white men, but kept it for blacks, effectively continuing to disfranchise them. This lasted until passage of the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1870.\n\nThe early history of free blacks and slaves in New York City became overshadowed by the waves of mid- to late nineteenth century immigration from Europe, which dramatically expanded the population and added to the ethnic diversity. In addition, most of the ancestors of today's African-American population in the city arrived from the South in the Great Migration of the first half of the twentieth century. In a rapidly changing city, the early colonial and federal history of African Americans was lost.\n\nThe burial ground in use for New York Town residents in the late 1600s was located at what is now the north graveyard of Trinity Church (of the Anglican / Church of England - today the Episcopal Church U.S.A.). The public burial ground was open to all for a fee, including to enslaved Africans. Some burials of deceased slaves were made just south of the public burial ground to avoid the fee. The stockade in this area ran northeast from the present-day corner of Broadway and Chambers Street to Foley Square; the wide street on the top right (southwest) is Broadway.\n\nAfter Trinity was established as a parish church in 1697, the vestryman of the church began taking control of land in Lower Manhattan, including existing public burial grounds. When Trinity purchased the land at Wall Street and Broadway for the construction of their church, they passed a resolution on October 25, 1697:\n\nThat after the Expiration of four weeks from the dates hereof no Negro's be buried within the bounds & Limitts of the Church Yard of Trinity Church, that is to say, in the rear of the present burying place & that no person or Negro whatsoever, do presume after the terme above Limitted to break up any ground for the burying of his Negro, as they will answer it at their perill & that this order be forthwith publish'd.\n\nThe \"rear of the present burying place\" did not include the town cemetery (now the north churchyard). The church petitioned for control of this burial ground, which was granted by the colonial Province of New York on April 22, 1703.\n\nThis prohibition against the burial of those of African descent necessitated finding another area acceptable to the colonial authorities. What would become the \"Negro's Burial Ground\" was located on what was then the outskirts of the developed town, just north of present-day Chambers Street and west of the former Collect Pond (later Five Points). The area was part of a land grant issued to Cornelius van Borsum on behalf of his wife Sara Roelofs (1624–1693) for her services as an interpreter between the town of New York and the various Native American tribes in the area, such as the Lenape and Wappinger. The land would remain part of her estate until the late 1790s when the grade was raised with landfill in anticipation of development, and the land subdivided into building lots.\n\nLabelled on old maps as the \"Negros Burial Ground,\" the 6.6-acre area was first recorded as being used around 1712 for the burials of enslaved and freed people of African descent. The first burials may date from the late 1690s after Trinity barred African burials in the former city cemetery. The area of the burial ground was in a shallow valley surrounded by low hills on the east, south and west, which enveloped the southern shore of Collect Pond and the Little Collect. The burial ground was outside the stockade marking the northern boundary of the city. The stockade in this area ran northeast from the present-day corner of Broadway and Chambers Street to Foley Square after it had expanded northward, similar in form and function to the former stockade on Wall Street. The revelation that physicians and medical students were illegally digging up bodies for dissection from this burial ground precipitated the 1788 Doctors' Riot.\n\nAfter the city closed the cemetery in 1794, the area was platted for development. The grade of the land was raised with up to of landfill at the lowest points covering the cemetery, thus preserving the burials and the original grade level. As urban development took place over the fill, the burial ground was largely forgotten. The first large-scale development on the land was the construction of the A.T. Stewart Company Store, the country's first department store; it opened in 1846 at the corner of 280 Broadway and Chambers Street. Several skeletons were unearthed during the commencement of building the store.\n\nThe site's earliest discovery in the early 19th century seems to have aroused little interest. According to an article in The New York Tribune, homeowner James Gemmel, who owned a house at 290 Broadway in the early 19th century, told an unnamed daughter that when the cellar for their house was being dug many human bones were found. He assumed that he had discovered a potter's field. In 1897, when the building at 290 Broadway was demolished to make way for the R. G. Dun and Company Building (later financial firm of Dun & Bradstreet), workers in excavating found a large number of human bones. Some concluded at that time that these were connected to a 1741 incident in which thirteen African Americans were burned at the stake and eighteen were hanged, however others wondered whether the bones were of Dutch or Indian origin. Many bones were taken as souvenirs by so-called \"relic hunters.\"\n\nIn October 1991, the United States Government agency, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced the discovery (or rediscovery) of intact burials during an archaeological survey and excavation for the construction of a new $275 million federal office building planned at 290 Broadway between Reade and Chambers Streets. The building was to be later known as the Ted Weiss Federal Building, named for deceased U.S. Representative (Congressman) Ted Weiss from New York. The agency had done an environmental impact statement (EIS) prior to purchase of the site, but the archaeological survey had predicted that human remains would not be found because of the long history of urban development in that area.\n\nAfter the discovery of the first intact burials became publicly known, the African-American community became very concerned. With the pressure of construction costs, GSA tried to continue excavation and construction on the site. The community believed it was not being sufficiently consulted and that respect was not being given to the nature of the discoveries. They believed that the burial findings required a better archaeological project design for protection and study of the remains.\n\nInitially, GSA had planned full archaeological retrieval of the remains as full mitigation of the effects of its construction project on the burial ground. Within the year, its teams removed the remains of 419 persons from the site, but it had become clear that the extent of the burial ground was too large to be fully excavated. In 1992, activists staged a protest at the site about GSA's handling of the burial issue, especially when it was found that some intact burials were broken up during construction excavation at part of the site. GSA halted construction until the site could be thoroughly assessed. It provided additional funding to conduct a further archaeological excavation to reveal any other bodies on the site and to assess the remains. Located between New York City Hall and the federal courts, the site had symbolic value. The \"invisibility\" of Black history in New York City partially accounts for the importance of the Foley Square site\"; activists hoped to find a means there to redress \"the injustice and the imbalance of the historic record, and to give voice to the silenced ones\".\n\nAlthough archaeologists studied the site and the remains for almost a dozen years, critics of the construction project believed GSA's original archaeological research design was inadequate, as it did not require a plan for the treatment of uncovered remains. In addition, the African-descendant community in New York City was not consulted in the development of the research design, nor were any archaeologists who had experience studying the African diaspora, although GSA had distributed the EIS to more than 200 state and local agencies and stakeholders, many recommended by the city. In the early stages of the project, national GSA officials and related Congressional committees directed that excavation and construction proceed.\n\nOversight of the project increased by stakeholders, such as the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and community activists. After continued protests from a coalition of community members, politicians, and scholars, in 1992 the House Subcommittee on Public Works held budget hearings for GSA in New York, at which it heard testimony from a wide variety of critics of GSA's handling of the project and also heard from the GSA Administrator. Several changes occurred. Control of the burial site was transferred from an archaeological firm in the city to the physical anthropologist Michael Blakey and his team at Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, D.C., for study at the Montague Cobb Biological Anthropology Laboratory. This ensured that African-American students would participate in studies of their ethnic ancestors' remains.\n\nIn large part due to activism by the African-American community, which lobbied the United States Congress on this project, in October 1992 Congress passed and President George H. W. Bush signed a law to redesign it in order to stop construction of the pavilion portion of the site (where the remains had been found) and to appropriate $3 million for a memorial in that area. The federal building project was redesigned to preserve part of the archaeological site for this purpose. The southern portion of the building, slated to be built on the parcel by Duane and Elk Streets, was eliminated to provide adequate room for a memorial.\n\nThe burial ground was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, as the extent of the burials made it significant for both regional and national history. Given its importance, GSA proposed partial mitigation of the adverse effects to the burial ground of the construction of 290 Broadway, by undertaking programs of data analysis, curation, and education. In addition, activists lobbied for landmark status for the burial ground, and gathered 100,000 signatures to send to the U.S. Department of the Interior. The ground was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. There was also growing support for a museum on the site to interpret African-American experience and history in New York.\n\nThe discovery and long controversy received national media attention, raising interest and awareness in public archaeology projects. Theresa Singleton, an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution said,\n\nThe media exposure has created a larger, national audience for this type of research. I've been called by dozens of scholars and laypeople, all of them interested in African-American archaeology, all of them curious about why they don't know more about the field. Until recently, even some black scholars considered African-American archaeology a waste of time. That's changed now.\n\nGovernment and private developers learned about the need to \"include descendant communities in their salvage excavations, especially when human remains are concerned.\" The findings at the burial ground already had highlighted some of the losses of slavery, as African Americans had not been recently recognized as a major part of early New York history until then. As the journalist Edward Rothstein wrote, \"Among the scars left by the heritage of slavery, one of the greatest is an absence: where are the memorials, cemeteries, architectural structures or sturdy sanctuaries that typically provide the ground for a people’s memory?\"\n\nIn total, the intact remains of more than 400 men, women and children of African descent were found at the site, where they had been buried individually in wooden boxes. There were no mass burials. Nearly half were children under 12, indicating the high mortality rate of the time. Historians and anthropologists estimate that over the decades, as many as 15,000–20,000 Africans were buried in Lower Manhattan. They have determined that this was the largest colonial-era cemetery for enslaved African people. It is also \"possibly the largest and earliest collection of American colonial remains of any ethnic group.\" Some of the burials included items related to African origins and burial practices.\n\nThe work of excavation and study of the remains was considered the \"most important historic urban archaeological project undertaken in the United States.\" These remains stand for the estimated tens of thousands of persons at the burial ground and historically in New York, representing Africans' \"critical\" role in \"the formation and development of this city and, by extension, the Nation.\" Because of its significance to African-American and United States history, on April 19, 1993, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n\nAs a result of public engagement, the Howard University team identified four questions which the community hoped to have answered from studies of the remains:\nSome bodies had items buried with them, as part of personal and cultural rituals. An example is the silver pendant shown at right. Some heads showed filed teeth, an African ritual decoration. Howard University did forensic studies, assessing the remains for nutrition, diseases and indicators of general living conditions for African slaves and free blacks.\n\nAfter the Howard University studies were completed, the remains were reinterred under mounds at the site in October 2003 in a ceremony including the \"Rites of Ancestral Return.\" The \"commemorative ceremony was inclusive and international in scope, and was organized by GSA and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\" of the New York Public Library. This emotional memorial stretched over multiple cities including Washington D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, and finally Manhattan. Thousands attended the reinterment and commemoration.\n\nIn consultation with stakeholders, GSA ran a design competition for the site memorial, which attracted 60 proposals. The winning memorial design by Rodney Leon and Nicole Hollant-Denis, created while they were partners at AARRIS Architects, was chosen in June 2004. The work was completed and dedicated on October 5, 2007.\n\nThe memorial design for the granite monument features a map of the Atlantic area within the \"Circle of Diaspora\" in reference to the Middle Passage, by which slaves were transported from Africa to North America. It is built of stone from South Africa and from North America, to symbolize the two worlds coming together. \"The Door of Return\", refers to \"The Door of No Return\", a name given to slave ports set up for involvement with the age-old local institution of slavery on the coast of West Africa, from which so many people were transported after sale by their native chiefs, never to see their homeland again. The memorial is designed to reconnect ethnic African Americans to their ancestors' origins.\n\nOn February 27, 2006, President George W. Bush signed a proclamation designating the burial site as the 123rd National Monument. It was transferred to the operating jurisdiction of the National Park Service as its 390th unit. The NPS runs the visitors center, built in 2010, and arranges for various cultural exhibitions and events at the site throughout the year. The memorial was dedicated in 2007 in a ceremony presided over by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and poet Maya Angelou. As part of the dedication ceremonies, the city officially renamed Elk Street as African Burial Ground Way.\n\nIn 2016, an offer to purchase 22 Reade Street and the Burial Grounds was made with a Letter of Intent to the City of New York. The bidding group was led by African-American owned development firm The Hoeg Corporation; Burial Ground Monument architect, Rodney Leon; and Italian development company, Bizzi & Partners Development.\n\nIn February 2010, a visitor center for the African Burial Ground National Monument opened in the Ted Weiss Federal Building at 290 Broadway, which was built over part of the archaeological site. The visitor center includes a permanent exhibit, \"Reclaiming Our History,\" on the significance of the burial site. Created by Amaze Design, it features a life-sized tableau by Studio EIS depicting a dual funeral for an adult and child. Other parts of the exhibit explore the work life of Africans in early New York and connection to national history, as well as the late 20th-century community success in preserving the burial ground. The visitor center includes a 40-person theater and a shop.\n\nIn addition to earning designation of the site as a National Historic Landmark and National Monument, the discoveries of the African Burial Ground have changed thinking about early African-American history in New York and the nation. Many new books have been published on this topic. In 2005 the New-York Historical Society mounted its first exhibit ever on slavery in New York; the planned six-month run was extended into 2007 because of its popularity.\n\nWhen the visitor center at the burial ground opened in 2010, Edward Rothstein wrote,\nA revision in popular understanding has taken place about slavery's history in New York City, evident in several recent books and an impressive series of shows at the New-York Historical Society. In the 18th century slaves may have constituted a quarter of the New York workforce, making this city one of the colonies' largest slave-holding urban centers.\n\n"}
{"id": "1939184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939184", "title": "Čukarica", "text": "Čukarica\n\nČukarica (, ) is a municipality of the city of Belgrade.\n\nLike several other neighborhoods of Belgrade, Čukarica was named after kafana. At the present location of the Sugar Refinery, there was a kafana in the second half of the 19th century. It was very popular as it was located at the point where two roads, one from Obrenovac and other from Šumadija, meet at the entrance to Belgrade. It was owned by Stojko Čukar and after him the kafana was named “Čukareva kafana” which later gave name to the settlement.\n\nThe village of Čukarica was transferred from the Vračar \"Srez\" under the administration of the Belgrade municipality on 8 July 1907. Municipality of Čukarica was established for the first time on 30 December 1911. After a popular referendum, inhabitants of Čukarica voted to split from the municipality of Žarkovo and as a result were given the municipal status by the king Peter I of Serbia. Popular folklore rivalry still exists among the inhabitants of Čukarica and Žarkovo, even though today they are both part of Belgrade.\n\nModern settlement began to develop as the first social housing for the workers of the sugar refinery, on the hill above the hyppodrome. Čukarica became known as the “workers settlement”. The first president of the municipality was an industrialist with the surname Novak, who emigrated from the Czech Republic. He changed his surname to the Serbian version Novaković and his direct descendants are the actress Olivera Marković (granddaughter) and her son, director Goran Marković (great-grandson).\n\nAfter the liberation in World War I in 1918, Čukarica administratively became part of Belgrade. After World War II when Belgrade municipalities were abolished and the city divided into raions in 1945, Čukarica became one of 5 administrative neighborhoods within Belgrade’s Raion VII. Municipalities were re-established in 1957. In 1960. the neighboring municipalities of Umka and Rakovica were incorporated into Čukarica, but Rakovica became a separate municipality again in 1974.\n\nČukarica is completely surrounded by other municipalities of Belgrade: it is bordered by the Sava river to the west, municipalities of Savski Venac to the north and northeast, Rakovica to the east, Voždovac to the southeast, Barajevo to the south and Obrenovac to the southwest.\n\nMunicipality is located southwest from the downtown Belgrade. It comprises the vast marshy woods of Makiš, on the eastern bank of the Sava river and the largest river island in Belgrade, Ada Ciganlija. At the suburb of Sremčica, \"Beogradski merokras\", the most northern terrain made of limestone (karst) is located.\n\nSeveral of the most important roads in western Serbia start here: Lazarevac Road, Ibar Highway, Sava Highway, New Obrenovac Road, Old Obrenovac Road, etc. Also, the largest and most important freight train station and marshalling yard in the area (Belgrade marshalling yard) and the main installations of the Belgrade waterworks, including the water factory, are located in the municipality (Makiš).\n\nČukarica was the first part of Belgrade that developed industry, in the late 19th and early 20th century and still is one of the most industrialized parts of Belgrade (Železnik, Žarkovo, Bele Vode), with commercial sections of the municipalities booming in the last 20 years (Banovo Brdo).\n\nOfficially the longest street in Belgrade, \"Obrenovački put\" (Obrenovač road) is located in the municipality. According to Belgrade's Directory of Roads, it is 11 kilometers long. However, as the road passes through the forests and mainly uninhabited areas and stretches outside the urban Belgrade City proper (\"uža teritorija grada\"), most Belgraders consider the 7.5-kilometer-long Bulevar kralja Aleksandra to be the longest street. While Obrenovač road runs only through one municipality (Čukarica), Bulevar kralja Aleksandra connects four of them: Stari Grad, Vračar, Palilula and Zvezdara.\n\nThe municipality of Čukarica covers an area of and it is divided in the urban and suburban part. The urban part of the municipality is completely within the Belgrade City proper, comprising many neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods, some of which used to be separate towns until the 1970s before Belgrade expanded that much to make urban connection to them (Žarkovo, Železnik). The neighborhood of Čukarica, which gave the name to the entire municipality, is located on a hill above the eastern bank of the Sava river. It is bordered by Careva Ćuprija and Senjak to the north, Banovo Brdo.\n\nThis is a list of the neighborhoods that comprise the municipality:\nThe suburban part comprises seven suburban settlements, four of them classified as urban and three as rural settlements:\n\nThe municipality has a population of 181,231 inhabitants, according to the 2011 census results. That makes Čukarica the second most populous municipality of Belgrade (after New Belgrade), but it is also the fastest growing one in terms of absolute growth of population (relative, about 1.05% annually). Despite having also a rural parts, the municipality is very densely populated – .\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\nHistorical Presidents of the Municipal Assembly since 1989:\n\nČukarica is twinned with:\n\n"}

Wilmington found great success in the US Open Cup in their later years, regularly drawing MLS teams in the late rounds. Their most famous result occurred in 2003 when they drew the Dallas Burn, an MLS team, in the middle of a particularly bad year. They shocked the soccer world by defeating the Burn 4–1 at Legion Sports Complex before bowing out to D.C. United 1–0 in the quarterfinal round. The Hammerheads regularly drew well over 2,000 fans per game, and had drawn nearly 5,000 for playoff games. On June 30, 2009, the Hammerheads upset the Chicago Fire in the third round of the 2009 US Open Cup 1–0 at home.\n\nThe team went on hiatus in 2010 and returned for the 2011 USL PRO regular season, due to local businessman Bill Rudisill and a minority ownership group combining their efforts and financial support to the Port City. Following the 2011 USL PRO regular season, the Hammerheads competed in the division semifinals. In 2012, the Hammerheads finished their regular season with an overall record of 10–7–7 After qualifying for playoffs, they defeated both the Richmond Kickers and Orlando City Lions to obtain their spot in the finals versus the Charleston Battery whom took the 2012 USL PRO Championship title at Blackbaud Stadium after defeating the Hammerheads 1–0. The Hammerheads fell short of qualifying for a playoff position following their 2013 regular season.\n\nIn September 2013, the Wilmington Hammerheads announced that after three years of dedicated ownership, Bill Rudisill would no longer be majority owner of the team and that George Altirs, CEO of Capelli New York, has taken the role of Wilmington Hammerheads Owner.\n\nIn January 2014, the Wilmington Hammerheads entered a developmental partnership deal with Major League Soccer side Toronto FC that would see a minimum of four Toronto players come to Wilmington with the goal of gaining first team experience. In August 2014, the Hammerheads' longtime head coach, Englishman David Irving, stepped down from his position following fifteen seasons with the club.\n\nNew York City FC announced a one-year affiliation with the Hammerheads in January 2015, in which NYCFC can send players to train and play in Wilmington for further development.\n\nOn August 1, 2016, it was reported that the Hammerheads were planning another hiatus from the USL, beginning with the 2017 season. This would allow the club to restructure \"in order to keep pace with the growth in stature of the USL.\" Six weeks later, the \"Washington Post\" reported that the Hammerheads were a possible contender to move to Baltimore, Maryland for the 2018 season, noting that Wilmington is the smallest of the league's twenty-nine markets. The team self-relegated to the Premier Development League on September 29, 2016.\n\nAfter the 2017 season, the PDL team was disbanded. The organization continues as a youth soccer academy under the name \"Wilmington Hammerheads Youth FC\".\n\n\n\n\nThe primary supporters group is the Port City Firm. The group was founded in 1997 and stuck together during the team's hiatus year in 2010.

It encompasses some of the oldest sections of urban Belgrade, thus the name (‘’stari grad’’, Serbian for “old city”). Stari Grad is one of the three municipalities that occupy the very center of Belgrade, together with Savski Venac and Vračar.\n\nDespite some of the oldest sections of Belgrade belong to Stari Grad, the municipality itself is among the latest urban ones formed administratively. It was formed by the merger of the municipality of Skadarlija and part of the municipality of Terazije on January 1, 1957.\n\nStari Grad occupies the ending ridge of Šumadija geological bar. The cliff-like ridge, where the fortress of Kalemegdan is located, overlooks the Great War Island and the confluence of the Sava river into the Danube, and makes one of the most beautiful natural lookouts in Belgrade. With Novi Beograd, it is one of 2 municipalities of Belgrade (out of 17) which occupy the banks of both major rivers in Belgrade, the Sava and the Danube (Zemun was the third, but when the municipality of Surčin split, Zemun was left with the Danube, and Surčin with the Sava bank).\n\nThe municipality of Stari Grad covers an area of just (second smallest in Belgrade, after Vračar) and borders the municipalities of Paliula on the east, Vračar on the south-east and Savski Venac on the south. The Sava makes a border to the municipality of Novi Beograd (west) and the Danube to the municipalities of Zemun (north-west) and the Banat's section of Palilula.\n\nThe riverside of the Danube has two distinct artificial bays, the small marina (Marina Dorćol) and the Port of Belgrade.\n\nThe neighborhood of Stari Grad is not generally considered by the Belgraders as one single definitive neighborhood. Area which Stari Grad covers is either simply styled \"downtown\" or by the names of the more established neighborhood which it overlaps: Two parts of Dorćol separated on social-difference and architecture basis, It spreads from the bank of Danube by the Kalemegdan fortress to the Republic Square also known as \"The Horse\". Downtown Belgrade is most populated area which makes it the heart of the city, it spreads from Terazije down to Despot Stefan Boulevard. Tasmajdan neighborhood is along with Šipka the on the east side of Stari grad next to municipality of Palilula.\n\nThis is a list of the neighborhoods in the municipality:\n\nLike the other two \"old\" municipalities of central Belgrade (Savski Venac and Vračar), Stari Grad for decades is a highly depopulating municipality, but being a central municipality and small in area, it remains one of the most densely populated municipalities in Serbia. There were 48,450 inhabitants according to the 2011 census or , compared to a population of 96,517 with a density of back in 1971.\n\nEven though residential areas are much densely compact compared to Vračar, the latter is densely populated because almost one third of Stari Grad, even though it is \"heart\" of Belgrade is not inhabited (mostly the large park of Kalemegdan and the highly industrialized riverside of the Danube, with dozens of factories and spacious hangars and depots). However, a number of people working on the territory of the municipality doubles its own population and makes possible for the municipality of Stari Grad to achieve GDP per capita 6 to 8 times higher than the average in Serbia.\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\nRecent presidents of the municipality:\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a curiosity, Stari Grad is the location of two shortest streets of Belgrade, \"Marka Leka\" and \"Laze Pačua\", which are 45 and 48 meters long, respectively. Despite being in the sole downtown and densely populated urban section, they have no numbers as all the buildings located in them are )numbered from the neighboring streets.\n\n\nCommunity health center Stari Grad was founded in 1948 as the Polyclinic of the First Raion. It was located at the corner of the Gospodar Jevremova and Kapetan Mišina streets, in the building of the Belgrade Shipping Society. It moved into the large, new building in the Simina Street in 1964. In 2018, it was estimated that municipality has 47,000 inhabitants, but the health center had 82,000 registered patients.\n\nUp to the 1860s, this area was uninhabited. Jovan Kujundžić, a tailor (\"terzija\", tailor of the cloths) had a ground floor house at the modern crossroad of the \"Makedonska\", \"Svetogorska\", \"Hilandarska\" and \"Cetinjska\" streets. He switched to the catering business and founded a kafana \"Dva bela goluba\" (\"Two white doves\"). Originally, it was a typical road \"meyhane\". The kafana became so famous, that the entire neighborhood and the modern \"Svetogorska\" Street, were named after it in 1872. By the end of the 19th century, the neighborhood gradually developed along the central street and became fully urbanized, as a direct, eastern extension of the city's downtown.\n\nIn the late 1920s, the Artisan Guild purchased the house and the surrounding lot in order to build the Home of the Artisans, which is today the building of the Radio Belgrade. Kujundžić had one condition, that the name is to be preserved. Because of that, above the entrance into the building, the sculptural composition was carved. It shows two persons with an anvil (symbol of artisans), next to the anvil are scissors (symbol of tailors), with two white doves. The kafana was moved to the Bohemian quarter of Skadarlija and the name for the neighborhood fell into oblivion.\n\nThe neighborhood remains a location of several important buildings which were declared a cultural monuments and protected by law:\n\n\nStari Grad is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

A student of his as a young man at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore was Cardinal Angelo Scola, who later served as Archbishop of Milan.\n\nSeverino spent a number of years on the faculty of the University of Venice as well.\n\nBecause of his original philosophical position, the so-called \"neoparmenidism\", Severino was claimed to be \"a giant\" and \"the only philosopher who in the 20th century can be compared to Heidegger\" (Massimo Cacciari).\n\nIn 1970, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ruled that Severino's ideas were not compatible with Christianity as the basis of Severino's belief in \"the eternity of all being,\" a belief said to eliminate a Creator God.\n\nSeverino received from the President of the Italian Republic the \"Golden medal of the Republic for culture merits\" (\"Medaglia d’oro della Repubblica per i Benemeriti della Cultura\"). He was also a member of Accademia dei Lincei, the official Italian scientific academy. He won several prizes and wrote opinion pieces on the \"Corriere della Sera\" newspaper.\n\nSeverino confronts an ancient problem, rooted in Plato and Aristotle and taken up in the modern era by Heidegger, that of Being. For Severino, all the philosophies which have been formed up to now are characterised by one fundamental error, faith in the Greek sense of becoming. Indeed, since the ancient Greeks, a being (or anything which is) has been considered as coming from nothing, granted existence temporarily, and then returning into nothing.\nSeverino, reflecting on the absolute opposition between Being and non-Being, given that between the two terms there is nothing in common, considers it evident that being can only remain constantly unchanging, not being changed by anything which is not itself. Thus, since Being is the totality of what exists, there can be nothing else besides it endowed with existence (Severino thereby refutes the concept of ontological difference as put forward by Heidegger). For Severino, therefore, the entire history of philosophy is based on the erroneous conviction that Being can become nothing.\n\nNot many of Severino's works have been translated. One of his crucial works has been translated into German: \"Vom Wesen des Nihilismus\", and into English as \"The Essence of Nihilism\".\n\n\n"}

Founded in 2003, the team most recently played in the United Soccer League (since renamed the USL Championship), the second tier of the United States soccer league system. In October 2018, the club announced it will not participate in the 2019 season and will resume play in 2020 as a member of the new USL League One, a league in the third tier.\n\nOn November 15, 2017 the team was rebranded as Penn FC. The rebrand served in conjunction with a partnership with Rush Soccer youth development program. Penn FC served Rush Soccer's professional team and the club's most important piece to their extensive network. The team plays its home games at FNB Field. The team's colors are blue, black and grey corresponding to Rush Soccer's branding established in 1997. In December 2019, ahead of the 2020 season, reports noted that the club had ceased operations and no longer had any employees on payroll.\n\nThe Harrisburg City Islanders were announced as a new professional soccer team on September 24, 2003 as a member USL Pro Soccer League’s Atlantic Division on the third tier of the American soccer pyramid. As the team prepared for its inaugural season, Bill Becher was named the first head coach of the club and forward David Bascome was signed as the first player. The City Islanders won their first match 5–2 on the road against the Northern Virginia Royals with Steve Fisher scoring the club's first ever goal.\n\nThe City Islanders were powerful contenders in the USL second division, finishing second the Atlantic Division and fifth overall in their inaugural season and qualifying for the playoffs. They were eliminated in the Atlantic Division Finals by the Pittsburgh Riverhounds.\n\nThe 2005 season saw the City Islanders continue to be contenders in the league, now organized in a single table as the USL Second Division (USL-2), finishing third in the table and qualifying for the playoffs. They were eliminated in the Atlantic Division Finals by the eventual champions, Charlotte Eagles. The season's success was recognized as Bill Becher was named USL-2 Coach of the Year, while Chad Severs was named Rookie of the Year who led the scoring with 13 goals and 5 assists.\n\nIn 2006, the club failed to reach the playoffs, but regained form in 2007. The City Islanders would win their first championship in USL Second Division Championship, defeating the Richmond Kickers on penalty kicks. Dustin Bixler was named the match's Most Valuable Player.\n\nThe City Islanders qualified for the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 but were unable to recapture the title. Danny Cepero played for Harrisburg on loan from the New York Red Bulls in 2008, and upon returning to New York, became the first goalkeeper in Major League Soccer history to score from open play. In 2009, Ty Shipalane became the second City Islander to win Rookie of the Year and became the first City Islander to jump directly to Major League Soccer after signing with D.C. United at the conclusion of the season.\n\nThe 2010 season would be the second time in the club's history missing the playoffs. On March 1, 2010, the City Islanders entered into an agreement to become the official USL affiliate of Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union. The affiliation would soon have City Islanders defender, Sheanon Williams sign with the Union and become an immediate insertion in the first tier club's starting eleven.\n\nThe 2011 season saw the USL Second Division be reorganized into the USL Pro with Harrisburg competing in the National Division. The City Islanders won the USL Pro National Division title over the Rochester Rhinos advancing to the first USL Pro final against the newly formed, and regular-season champion, Orlando City. Similar to the last championship appearance, the City Islanders would play to a draw (2–2) in regulation time, only this time falling on penalty kicks 3–2.\n\nThe City Islanders would have successful seasons in 2012 and 2013, but would earn a spot in the USL Pro final during the 2014 season after a dark horse run through the playoffs, having finished in the last remaining qualifier spot. The final was, again, played at a newly formed club, and regular-season champion, Sacramento Republic FC. Sacramento would win the title 2–0, with Harrisburg earning their second runner-up in four seasons.\n\nUndergoing massive expansion and vying for second division status in the American soccer pyramid, the USL Pro was rebranded as simply \"USL.\" The re-branding and additional teams intended to increase the quality of play and infrastructure throughout the league, as well as provide better player development in cooperation with Major League Soccer. Since the league restructured, the City Islanders have struggled to keep pace, missing out on the playoffs for both the 2015 and 2016 seasons.\n\nOn January 5, 2017, the United States Soccer Federation granted USL provisional Division II status; making the 2017 season the first time the City Islanders would compete as a Division II team. Shortly before the 2017 season, George Altirs was announced as new majority owner of the club so as to \"stay in Harrisburg and build an international developmental base that is unique and exciting.\" As majority owner, Altirs \"will oversee the technical side of the club, including player and staff selections, transfers, and outside, non-local partnerships for the Harrisburg City Islanders.\" The ownership addition was intended to allow the City Islanders to keep pace with the growth of the USL.\n\nOn November 15, 2017, it was announced that the City Islanders would be rebranded as Penn FC starting with the 2018 season. The rebrand was announced as a focus on player and product development, situating the team as the top of a development pyramid for the existing Rush Soccer program. The rebranding saw wholesale changes with the team's personnel, retaining only five players from the 2017 roster. Bill Becher was appointed technical director, leaving his role as the club's first and only head coach. In February 2017, Raoul Voss was announced as the first head coach for Penn FC. Ahead of the 2018 season, Penn FC made some key signings including the return of former City Islander standouts Ken Tribbett and Lucky Mkosana, and forward Tommy Heinemann.\n\nPenn FC's inaugural season started off with mixed results, going 6-4-7 through their first 17 matches. Conflicts with baseball operations and schedule at FNB Field required the team to have an to have long away stints until a final 9-match home stand. The team's poor away form mid-season carried into the home-stand with Penn FC going 1-2-6 in their remaining 9 matches. The team finished 13th in the Eastern Conference, their lowest position since joining the USL.\n\nPrior to the conclusion to the 2018 season, the Penn FC officially announced the team would be on hiatus for the 2019 season and return play in 2020 as part of the newly formed USL League One in the third tier of American soccer. After months of speculation, there had been minimal announcements regarding the team's preparations for entering League One. In December 2019, during the USL Winter Meetings, reports noted that the club had ceased operations and no longer had any employees on payroll after 16 years of professional soccer.\n\nPenn FC also competes in the U.S. Open Cup, where they developed a reputation as \"giant killers\" for defeating several teams from Major League Soccer. Harrisburg boasts an overall record of 12–5–3 in the competition, including a perfect 5–0 mark against teams from the Premier Development League and 5–6 record against MLS clubs. The City Islanders first competed in the U.S. Open Cup in 2007, defeating two amateur squads before upsetting D.C. United 1–0 to reach the quarterfinals. They subsequently lost to the New England Revolution 1–2, but in 2009 exacted revenge by beating the Revolution 2–1 before losing to D.C. United 1–2 in the quarterfinals. The City Islanders repeated the feat in 2010, knocking off Major League Soccer's New York Red Bulls 1–0 in the round of 16 and claiming a cash prize for advancing furthest of any USL Pro team in the tournament. The City Islanders again dispatched the New England Revolution in the 2012 edition of the U.S. Open Cup, prevailing on penalty kicks after a 3–3 draw in the round of 32. Harrisburg next defeated the Red Bulls 3–1 to advance to the quarterfinals, where they lost to the Philadelphia Union by a 5–2 scoreline. In 2012, the City Islanders again won the cash prize for advancing further than any USL Pro team in the tournament by virtue of a tie-breaker.\n\nThe City Islanders hosted several exhibition matches, or friendlies, against international and top-flight competition. A partnership with D.C. United of Major League Soccer created the \"Clash of the Capitals,\" annual matches between the two capital cities held in 2005–06. In the inaugural edition of the competition in 2005, D.C. United won 1–0 in front of over 4,000 fans at the Skyline Sports Complex. The following year's matchup was staged at Cumberland Valley High School, where 5,133 fans turned out to witness Freddy Adu and United prevail 2–1. That same year included the City Islanders' first international exhibition, as the club defeated Jamaica's Village United F.C. 5–1 at Hersheypark Stadium.\n\nIn 2009, the City Islanders played Crystal Palace F.C. of the Football League Championship, England's second division, at Lancaster's Clipper Magazine Stadium. A crowd of 5,099 witnessed the match, a 3–1 Crystal Palace win that included goals by Palace stars Darren Ambrose, Neil Danns, and Freddie Sears. Brandon Swartzendruber scored the lone goal for the City Islanders.\n\nOn March 1, 2010, the City Islanders entered into an agreement to become the official USL affiliate of Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union. As part of their affiliation, the City Islanders host annual friendly matches against the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer. As of the 2014 season, the Islanders have only won one match against their top flight affiliate.\n\nIn 2010, the teams played to a 1–1 draw, with Danny Mwanga giving the Union a lead in the 30th minute before an own goal allowed Harrisburg to equalize a minute later. J.T. Noone appeared for both clubs in the match, playing the first half for the City Islanders before switching jerseys and completing the second half for Philadelphia.\n\nThe Union prevailed in the 2011 edition by a 5–3 scoreline. The City Islanders carried a 2–0 lead into halftime behind goals by Nelson Becerra and Andrew Welker, but heavy substitutions allowed the Union to demonstrate their superior depth, and they scored five times in thirty minutes before Jose Angulo pegged one back.\n\nWith both teams fielding numerous reserves, the City Islanders won the 2012 rematch, which was played at Hersheypark Stadium. Jorge Perlaza and Kai Herdling scored for the Union, while a brace by Garret Pettis and goal by Yann Ekra carried the USL-PRO outfit to the 3–2 victory.\n\nAfter five years of cooperation, it was announced on August 19, 2015 that the affiliation would dissolve at the conclusion of the 2015 season as the Union would develop their own USL team, Bethlehem Steel FC, in the Lehigh Valley starting in 2016. The final friendly between the two teams as affiliates took place in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in front of a record crowd of 6,546 attendees. The Union won the match 3–1.\n\nThe table below summarizes the results of the annual contests between the Islanders and Union.\n\nThe team's colors are blue and white. The logo can also be adorned with a gold star above it, representing the USL Championship the team won in 2007. The team has since issued two anniversary crests for their 10th and 12th seasons.\n\nIn 2016, the City Islanders alternatively dropped \"Harrisburg\" from the team's title in an attempt to increase the club's footprint in central Pennsylvania.\n\nFor the first 12 seasons, the City Islanders competed at the Skyline Sports Complex. Since the 2016 season at FNB Field on City Island in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The stadium has a capacity of 6,187 spectators. The City Islanders also compete at Clipper Magazine Stadium in Lancaster, Pennsylvania which serves as an alternate home ground during the 2016 season.\n\nRecognizing the need to modernize the facilities with the growth of the USL, in 2015 the parent company of the Harrisburg City Islanders, the Harrisburg Capital Soccer, Inc. have begun applying for grant funding to facilitate upgrades to the existing complex. The proposed upgrades are anticipated to include increasing capacity to 5,000 seats, dedicated VIP areas, entrance plaza, upgraded concessions, restrooms, indoor locker rooms, state-of-the-art broadcasting booth, and a new scoreboard. New seating is intended to be an upgrade from existing bleachers with a mix of individual bucket seats, ten luxury suites, a VIP deck with seating, and bleacher seats with back supports. This expansion is intended to meet the minimum capacity required by the USSF for a league to compete as Division 2 in the American soccer pyramid.\n\nThe 2016 season marked the City Islanders transition from Skyline Sports Complex to FNB Field on City Island in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The transition was a result of the collaboration with the current tenants, the Harrisburg Senators, and to keep pace with the stadium standards being implemented by the USL. The team will also share home matches with Clipper Magazine Stadium in Lancaster, Pennsylvania as an effort to expand the Islanders fanbase throughout south central Pennsylvania. From the 2017 season, the Penn FC plays all of their home matches at FNB Field to focus on the Harrisburg area.\n\nWhen Penn FC announced their hiatus for the 2019 season, the decision was largely cited as looking for a more permanent stadium solution. Sharing FNB Field with the Harrisburg Senators proved to be difficult with scheduling and poor playing conditions because of the transitions between soccer and baseball fields.\n\nAs the City Islanders, The City Islanders Academy system fielded both boys and girls teams U-9 through U-17, and U20 and U23 adult men's teams. The club also fielded teams that competed in the Super-20 League, a league for players 17 to 20 years of age, operated by the United Soccer Leagues. The academy has also established partnerships with 17 youth soccer clubs across Central Pennsylvania.\n\nThe re-branding of the club to Penn FC has also begun the club's partnership with Rush Soccer, an established youth academy system based in Littleton, Colorado representing over 32,000 youth soccer players from 85 clubs around the world. The goal of the partnership was to provide the academy with a professional team to be at the pinnacle of the Rush Soccer development program, drawing from large player pools and international affiliations. Rush soccer became a pioneer by reverse-engineering the pathway from youth soccer to the professional level.\n\nAs the City Islanders, two supporters groups had formed: the City Island Hecklers (founded by \"Them Hecklerz\"), and the Sons of the Susquehanna (founded by Tyler Knupp, Kris Ortega, Ian Goldinger, and Raymond Stellhorn former Cedar Cliff High School Students). The both groups would position themselves behind opposing goals on matchdays. During the City Islanders affiliation with the Philadelphia Union, members of the Sons of Ben (supporters of the Philadelphia Union) also provided support.\n\nAhead of the 2017 season, the newly formed Capital City Crew became the recognized supporters group of the team.\n\nMost Penn FC home matches are broadcast live on Invica, with tape delay feeds on ABC 27 Weather Channel, Comcast channel 245 and Verizon Fios channel 462. Additionally, many road games are broadcast through USLLive. Michael Bullock covers the team for the Patriot-News, while Derek Meluzio provides commentary and videos from his \"Upper 90\" blog. The column \"Confessions of a Soccer Nobody\" appears regularly in the \"Sports' Burger\", offering additional coverage and insight.\n\nAs of the 2014 season, USL began regularly broadcasting all league matches on the USL YouTube channel. Home match broadcasting is provided live by Inivca where play-by-play announcing covered by Brian Keyser with color commentary by Charlie Gerow.\n\nReferenced from HCI coaching staff and front office.<br>\nBill Becher appointed general manager in February 2016.<br>\nTim Schulz, Rush Soccer President & CEO, appointed general manager in January 2018.\n\n\n\nThe following detail individual achievements earn by Penn FC players over the club's history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferenced from Harrisburg City Islanders club history.\n\nAlthough they had been rivals and competed against each other in previous seasons, the inaugural Keystone Derby was officially contested between Penn FC and the Pittsburgh Riverhounds in 2015. Pittsburgh went on to win the cup in the first edition of the tournament in a series that saw 28 goals through four matches. The City Islanders would claim their first derby title in 2016.\n\nKey\n"}

His father was Filipino and his mother was African American.\n\nUpon his release in 1965, he turned his attention to music and formed his first band, Joe Bataan and the Latin Swingers. Bataan was influenced by two musical styles: the Latin boogaloo and African American doo-wop. Though Bataan was neither the first nor only artist to combine doo-wop-style singing with Latin rhythms, his talent for it drew the attention of Fania Records. After signing with them in 1966, Bataan released \"Gypsy Woman\" in 1967. (The title track is a Latin dance cover of \"Gypsy Woman\" by The Impressions). He would, in full, release eight original titles for Fania which included the gold-selling \"Riot!\". These albums often mixed energetic Latin dance songs, sung in Spanish, with slower, English-language soul ballads sung by Bataan himself. As a vocalist, Bataan's fame in the Latin music scene at the time was only rivaled by Ralfi Pagan.\n\nDisagreements over money with Fania Records head Jerry Masucci led Bataan to eventually leave the label. While still signed to Fania however, Bataan secretly started Ghetto Records, a Latin music label which got its initial funding from a local gangster, George Febo. Bataan produced several albums for other artists, including Papo Felix, Paul Ortiz and Eddie Lebron.\n\nIn 1973, he helped coin the phrase \"salsoul\", lending its name to his first post-Fania album. Along with the Cayre brothers, Kenneth, Stanley, and Joseph, he co-founded the Salsoul label, though later sold out his interest. He recorded three albums for Salsoul and several singles, including \"Rap-O Clap-O\" from 1979 which became an early hip hop hit.\nAfter his 1981 album, \"Bataan II\", he retired from music-making to spend more time with his family and ended up working as a youth counselor in one of the reformatories he himself had spent time in as a teenager.\n\nIn 2005, Bataan teamed up with producer Daniel Collás to break his long hiatus with the release of \"Call My Name\", a well-received album recorded in New York for Spain's Vampisoul label.\n\nBataan is also the father of Asia Nitollano, winner of \"\".\n\nIn the 2006 video game, \"Driver Parallel Lines\", Joe Bataan's song \"Subway Joe\" was included in the soundtrack.\n\nIn early 2009, Bataan was featured in the Kenzo Digital-produced \"beat cinematic\" \"City of God's Son\". Bataan was featured as the narrator of the story, playing the part of an older Nas reflecting upon his youth in the street with cohorts Jay-Z, Ghostface Killah, Biggie and Raekwon.\n\nIn 2013, Bataan received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York chapter of the Filipino American National Historical Society. In 2016, Bataan (along with the Barrio Boys) performed at the FANHS National Conference in New York- where 500 conference attendees danced to his music while cruising the Hudson River on the Hornblower Infinity.\n\nIn 2014, he met Osman Jr, from French group Setenta which, in collaboration with promoter Benjamin Levy, leads him to play for the first time in Paris in June 2015 at Le théatre des Etoiles, followed by a historic live at the Jazz Mix de Vienne in France. In September 2015, Bataan sang \"My Rainbow\", a soulful bolero composed by the French band. This title was released in 2016 on the album \"Paris to Nueva York\" released by Latin Big Note. With Setenta as this backing band, Bataan travels and plays on famous scenes as Selma in Stockholm (Sweden), Ronnie Scott's (London), the FGO (Paris), the Summer Stage in New York and the Théatre de la Mer of Fiest'a Sète (France).\n\nIn 2015, Bataan featured on vocal on Alex Puddu's album \"Soul Tiger\" on three songs \"The Mover,Love Talk and 50'000 women can't be wrong\" The last two songs were written by Puddu/Bataan and released by schema records\n\nIn 2017, Bataan collaborated with Spanglish Fly, the boogaloo revival group based in New York City, to record \"New York Rules,\" written by Manuel Garcia-Orozco and Jonathan Goldman, released on the band's \"Ay Que Boogaloo!\" (Chaco World Music). Singing lead vocals, Bataan includes references to his famous songs \"Subway Joe\" and \"Rap-o Clap-o.\" \"The Huffington Post\" calls this recording \"charming, spellbinding and irresistible.\" A remix of the song is included on the soundtrack to \"She's Gotta Have It\" (2019), written and directed by Spike Lee.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939208", "title": "Country rap", "text": "Country rap\n\nCountry rap is a fusion genre of popular music blasting country music with hip hop-style rapping.\n\nEarly influences on the emergence of country rap as a distinct genre include talking blues like \"Big Bad John\" (1961) by Jimmy Dean, \"A Boy Named Sue\" (1969) by Johnny Cash and \"Uneasy Rider\" (1975) by Charlie Daniels. Black artists who may have been influential in the genre's development include Jamaican ska artist Prince Buster's \"Texas Hold-Up\" (1964), \"Lil Ole Country Boy\" (1970) by Parliament, and \"Black Grass\" (1972) by Bad Bascomb. Music journalist Chuck Eddy traces the genre's roots back to Woody Guthrie.\n\nBlowfly's single \"Blowfly’s Rapp\" (1980) drew on the influence of earlier country musicians like Charlie Daniels and C. W. McCall; \"NPR\" said the song is a \"\"Deliverance\"-style encounter with Ku Klux Klan-accredited truck drivers to light funk backing\". \"Spin Magazine\" said Trickeration's \"Western Gangster Town\" (1980) (released four years before Schoolly D's \"Gangsta Boogie\") is \"cowboy rap’s Rosetta stone, and probably the first 'gangster' rap\". Other early examples of country rap are Sir Mix-A-Lot's \"Square Dance Rap\" (1985) where he raps in the voice of a \"white country boy\". The lyric \"\"From L.A. to Carolina / Drop them suckers in Aunt Jemima\"\" in Sir Mix-A-Lot's \"Buttermilk Biscuits\" (1988) is a reference to what many consider a racial stereotype, trademarked after Chris L. Rutt heard a performance of the minstrel song \"Old Aunt Jemima\" (1876). \n\nThe song \"Rappin' Duke\" (1985) is a parody of western film star John Wayne: \"Two hundred punks, well, what you gonna do?/I got two six-shooters that’ll see me through\". The song also contains a reference to \"Old Folks at Home\" (1851). The genre-blending wasn't limited only to hip hop artists; country duo Bellamy Brothers released \"Country Rap\" (1987) with lyrics about soul food, church, turnip greens and black-eyed peas. \n\nUGK became pioneer of the hardcore Southern rap style that emerged after the success of the Geto Boys, which they started to call \"country rap\". At the end of \"Let Me See It\", Pimp C raps: \"This ain't no muthafuckin' hip-hop records, these country rap tunes\", originally a response to Northern hip hop artists who had criticized Southern rap for not being \"real hip-hop\". The name of the song \"Hay\" (1996) by Crucial Conflict is a reference to marijuana.\n\nCountry rap in its modern form can be traced back to Kid Rock's \"Cowboy\" which reflects a cross-section of Kid Rock's country music, Southern rock and hip hop influences, even quoting a piano riff from the Doors song \"L.A. Woman\". Kid Rock has described the song as a cross between Run DMC and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nIn the early 2000s, producer Shannon \"Fat Shan\" Houchins and Bubba Sparxxx released Sparxxx's 2001 debut album \"Dark Days, Bright Nights\" as an independent release. The blend of country and trap caught the attention of producer Jimmy Iovine who re-released the album on Interscope. Houchins soon after created Average Joes Entertainment with Colt Ford. With songs like \"No Trash in My Trailer\" (2008) and \"Drivin' Around Song\" (2013), Ford has sold over one million albums.\n\nThe trend continued in 2005 when country music stars Big & Rich introduced Cowboy Troy and his album \"Loco Motive\". Troy has said he uses \"country instrumentation\" that includes a banjo, fiddle, and acoustic guitar blended with \"shredding rock guitar riffs and a rap delivery.\" Hal Crowther has written that \"I Play Chicken With the Train\" (2006) by Cowboy Troy was \"scandalous \"not\" because it mixes 'black' rap with 'white' country, but because, through the sheer force of unlikely-but-seamless juxtaposition, it forces us to acknowledge that those two musical styles, at least when they whoop it up, are brothers under the skin\". \n\nIn the late 2010s, country rap has returned to prominence as part of the \"Yee Haw\" movement, a trend characterized by hip hop producers incorporating country music into their own recordings. Young Thug's 2017 song \"Family Don't Matter\" is credited with popularizing the movement. Artists within \"Yee Haw\" include Lil Tracy and DaBaby. Other country rap artists include Ryan Upchurch, Jawga Boyz, Bottleneck, Moonshine Bandits and Big Smo. Cowboy Troy, Lenny Cooper and The Lacs were three of the top country rap artists of 2013 each with an album on \"Billboard\"'s Country Chart.\n\nIn 2019, 20-year-old rapper Lil Nas X's country rap single \"Old Town Road\" achieved mainstream international success. Assisted by several subsequent versions, including a remix featuring country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, the song broke multiple U.S. streaming records and charted at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for a record nineteen weeks. In June 2019, Blanco Brown's \"The Git Up\", described by \"USA Today\" as a \"trap-country\" song, also achieved viral success.\n\nThe Mo Thugs Family single \"Ghetto Cowboy\" (1998) is noted for featuring a harmonica. \"Cruise (remix)\" (2012) by Florida Georgia Line featured Nelly; \"Rolling Stone\" said the track \"ushered in the wave of escapist fantasies set to syncopated drum loops that became known as 'bro country'. Florida Georgia Line has said that Nelly's part \"just connected\", helping to make the \"Cruise\" remix reach Billboard Hot Country Songs No. 1 and No. 4 on the Hot 100; it also became the first country single to ever gain a RIAA diamond certification. \n\nB.o.B and country singer Taylor Swift collaborated on \"Both of Us\" (2012). The track features Swift's country vocals and a blend of hip-hop with banjos. It became a top 10 hit in Australia and New Zealand and a top 20 hit in the US. \n\nCountry singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J recorded the controversial song \"Accidental Racist\" for Paisley's 2013 album \"Wheelhouse\".\n\nOther collaborations include \"Po' Folks\" (2002) by Nappy Roots with Anthony Hamilton, \"Country Folks\" (2012) by Bubba Sparxxx featuring Colt Ford & Danny Boone, \"Dirt Road Anthem\" (remix) by Jason Aldean and Ludacris, Meghan Linsey with Bubba Sparxxx on \"Try Harder Than That\" (2014).\n\nPhysical sales of country rap albums are higher in more rural areas where country rap fans do not have the Internet services required to stream or download music. There are numerous country rap festivals where artists gather to play their music for upwards of 7,000 fans.\n\nThe term \"hick-hop\" is often criticized by some southern artists, with Struggle Jennings saying, \"I love the country, I love the South, I've been fishing and hunting, but I'm not a hick. I'm not hick-hop”. The political ideology of country rap artists is perceived as being right-wing or conservative, due to some right-leaning politics expressed by artists like Upchurch; however the political ideology of country rap artists ranges the full spectrum of political beliefs.\n"}
{"id": "1939213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939213", "title": "Johnnie Walker Classic", "text": "Johnnie Walker Classic\n\nThe Johnnie Walker Classic was a European Tour golf tournament which was played in the Asia-Pacific region. Johnnie Walker is a brand name and the owners have a long history of tournament sponsorship. They also sponsored the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles which was a European Tour event played in Scotland. The event was originally called the Johnnie Walker Asian Classic. There was a tournament already called the Johnnie Walker Classic in Australia, but when that event ceased in 1992, the word Asian was dropped from the name.\n\nIn 1989 Johnnie Walker sponsored the Hong Kong Open, and it was decided to establish an additional tournament which it would sponsor on an ongoing basis. This tournament was called the Johnnie Walker Asian Classic, and was first staged in Hong Kong in 1990. Subsequently, it became a touring event, essentially used by its sponsor as a marketing exercise in the Asia Pacific region. In 1992 it became the first event to be sanctioned by the European Tour in East Asia (the Dubai Desert Classic was the first in Asia as a whole). In 1993 the word Asian was dropped from the title. In 2005 the tournament was held in China for the first time, as part of the European Tour's push into China, which saw four events held in mainland China and one in Hong Kong in the 2005 season. The location of the tournament changes every year.\n\nThe tournament was co-sanctioned with the PGA Tour of Australasia from 1996, and by the Asian Tour from 1999. In 2005 the tri-sanctioned event had a field consisting of 60 European Tour players, 60 Asian Tour players, 28 PGA Tour of Australasia players, and 8 sponsors' invitees. The prize fund was £1,250,000. This amount is large by Asian and Australasian Tour standards, but not by European Tour or PGA Tour standards. However the tournament attracts a number of the World's leading players each year by paying them large appearance fees. Nine of the first fourteen editions were won by players who have topped the Official World Golf Ranking at some point in their career (Faldo, Els and Woods twice each; Woosnam, Norman and Couples once each).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939214", "title": "Seacoast United Phantoms", "text": "Seacoast United Phantoms\n\nThe New Hampshire Phantoms are an American soccer team based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States. Founded in 1996, the team plays in USL League Two, the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid.\n\nWhile based in New Hampshire, the team currently plays its home games at Amesbury Sports Park in Massachusetts. From 2011 to 2017, the team played its home games in the stadium on the campus of Portsmouth High School. The team's colors are blue, white, gold and black.\n\nThe team also fields a team in the USL's Super-20 League, a league for players 17 to 20 years of age run under the United Soccer Leagues umbrella.\n\nNew Hampshire Phantoms joined the ranks of American pro soccer in 1996 as an expansion franchise in the third-tier USISL Pro League. They finished their first season in competition with a decent 8–7–1 record, in 6th place in the Northeast Conference behind Central Jersey Riptide, but out of the playoffs. They improved to a 9–5–4 record in 1997 and finished third in the Northeast behind North Jersey Imperials, and qualified for the post-season for the first time. Their run through the playoffs was impressive: they took out divisional rivals Rhode Island Stingrays 2–1 in overtime in the divisional semi finals, and then beat Central Jersey Riptide 2–0 to progress to the national tournament. The Phantoms squeaked past Mid-Atlantic division side Baltimore Bays 1–0 in overtime in the quarter finals, and were just one win away from the Championship Game, but lost 2–1 in overtime to eventual champions Albuquerque Geckos in the semi finals. Ron Murphy was the Phantoms' top scorer in a very successful year, with 19 goals, the fourth best in the league.\n\nThings were even better for the Phantoms in 1998, as they improved their regular season performance for the second straight year, finishing with a 10–6–2 records and 2nd in the Northeast behind Rhode Island Stingrays. Their '98 playoff run was even more impressive than the previous year's: they beat Western Mass Pioneers 2–1 in overtime in the divisional semi final, and qualified for the national tournament for the second time with a dogged 3–2 win over Rhode Island in the divisional final. The Phantoms downed Central Jersey Riptide 3–0 in the quarter finals, and then overcame South Central Division champions Austin Lone Stars 2–1 in overtime in the semis. New Hampshire faced the Chicago Stingers in the Championship Game, but fell 3–2 in another overtime classic, and eventually finished the year as the second-best team in the D3 Pro League. In the post-season awards, goalkeeper Jeremy Bailey was honored as one of the top stoppers in the league, with an impressive 1.07 GAA average.\n\n1999 cemented New Hampshire's position as perennial contenders: they finished third in the re-structured Northern Division behind Western Mass Pioneers with a 13–5–0 record, and beat New Jersey Stallions 1–0 in the conference playoff semi-finals, but failed to progress to the national competition for a third straight year as they were beaten 1–0 in overtime by Western Mass in the Conference Final. Ron Murphy was again the Phantoms' top scorer, with 15 goals, while Andrew Boyea posted encouraging 1.27 GAA goalkeeping stats.\n\nThe Phantoms made the post season for a fourth time in 2000, finishing third behind the New Jersey Stallions in the regular season table, but fell at the first hurdle in the playoffs, losing 3–2 to Reading Rage first time out. 2001 was much of the same: second in the regular season behind the expansion Boston Bulldogs with an 8–8–2 record, but out in the first round of the playoffs following a 4–2 loss to their divisional rivals, the New Jersey Stallions, although Ron Murphy continued to be a potent goalscoring force for the Phantoms, with 17 goals on the season. 2002 was the first year that things did not go the Phantoms' way, as they finished the year bottom of the Northern Conference table with just four wins all season, and out of the playoffs for the first time in four years.\n\nThe D3 Pro League became the Pro Select League in 2003, and the Phantoms bounced back superbly in regular season play, finishing second in the Northern Region behind Westchester Flames with a hugely encouraging 11–7–2 record, before falling to the Flames 5–3 on aggregate in the first round of the playoffs. 2003 also saw New Hampshire's first foray into the US Open Cup, but their stay in the competition was marked by controversy: they originally beat USASA team Bridgeport Italians 3–0 in the second round; however, the team the Italians beat in the first round – PDL outfit Chesapeake Dragons – protested the result of the first-round game, due to the Italians fielding an ineligible player, and as a result the Italians were disqualified from the competition. This meant that New Hampshire had to play a *second* second-round game, this time against Chesapeake. Fortunately, the Phantoms won the game 3–2 with a golden goal from Ebbie Kodiat, and progressed to the third round – where they were unceremoniously dumped out of the competition 4–1 by A-League side Rochester Raging Rhinos. Bjørn Hansen was New Hampshire's top scorer, with 17 goals, the fourth best figures in the league.\n\n2004 brought the first piece of silverware to New Hampshire when, after eight years of competition, they topped the Northern Division standings, four points clear of second placed Westchester Flames. The Phantoms got a bye to the Pro Soccer League playoff semi finals, and were well-placed to make their second trip to the Championship game, but were unexpectedly beaten 1–0 by Southern Division winners Charlotte Eagles, and went home early. The Phantoms also made their second trip to the US Open Cup in '04, but unexpectedly lost 5–1 to PDL team Chicago Fire Reserves in the second round. Bjørn Hansen was again New Hampshire's top scorer, with 16 goals on the season, while Kyle Singer posted 1.223 GAA goalkeeping stats.\n\nThe USL Pro Select League was renamed the USL Second Division in 2005, and converted to a single-table format, but the Phantoms never got to grips with the new setup, and struggled on the field. The Phantoms lost five of their six opening games, conceding three goals in four of the games, and were grasping for any kind of run in form almost from the beginning of the season. A 6–0 hammering of the Northern Virginia Royals at home in early June that featured a brace from striker Mark Manganello briefly raised the spirits, and back-to-back wins over Long Island Rough Riders and Charlotte Eagles hinted that a late-season surge could be on the cards in Manchester, but the Phantoms reverted to their poor form quickly. A win and three ties in July effectively ended their playoff hopes, and the 5–2 defeat on the road at Long Island was the low point of the year. A final day victory over the Rough Riders made up for their pummeling earlier in the season, but it was too little too late for New Hampshire, who ended the season in 7th place, 22 points behind regular season champions Western Mass Pioneers. Bjørn Hansen and Thomas McNeil shared the goal scoring spoils, with 6 goals each, while Ricky Charles, Hansen and James Proctor weighed in with 3 assists apiece.\n\n2006 was a year of mid-table obscurity for the Phantoms, finishing with a 9–10–1 record, and in 5th place in the USL Second Division standings, just missing out on the post season once more. The year started brightly for New Hampshire, with two wins and a tie in their first three games, including 3–1 victory over Long Island Rough Riders. The Phantoms were quite excellent at home, losing just two games in front of their own fans all season. Defender Narciso Fernandes scored twice in their 3–1 win over Western Mass Pioneers in mid-July, and Almir Barbosa hit a hat trick against the Cincinnati Kings in their 3–1 win in early August. The Phantoms even enjoyed a brief run to the third round of the US Open Cup, taking out Connecticut-based USASA side Milford International before being walloped 5–1 by USL First Division outfit Rochester Raging Rhinos. Unfortunately, the Phantoms' form on the road was abysmal, with eight straight road losses away from home stretching from early June through to the edge of the season. They also suffered some humiliating defeats during this stretch: Western Mass Pioneers hit them for six in mid-July, and put another half dozen past them in a 6–2 win in August. The Harrisburg City Islanders hit four in a bad-tempered game which saw three men sent off in injury time, and the Richmond Kickers showed no mercy to goalkeeper T.J. Tomasso when completing an 8–0 rout on the final day of the season. Almir Barbosa was the Phantoms' top scorer, with 10 goals, while Thomas McNeil contributed 5 assists.\n\nThe Phantoms sank to their lowest ebb in 2007, winning just three games in what turned out to be a long and difficult season. They started the season with a 7-game winless streak, being hammered 4–0 by both the Richmond Kickers and the Cincinnati Kings, and conceding an injury time goal to Cleveland City Stars in their 3–2 defeat there, before eventually winning their first game of the season, 1–0 over Western Mass Pioneers in early June. Due to stadium issues, the Phantoms were forced to play 10 of their first 14 games on the road, prior to embarking on a 6-game home stand to finish the season. The Phantoms did manage to pick up two more wins – 2–1 over Richmond Kickers and a hard-fought 3–2 over Wilmington Hammerheads – but were eliminated from playoff contention well before their 3–1 loss to Cincinnati on the final day of the season. They eventually finished the year 9th of 10 in the standings, just one point ahead of rock-bottom Bermuda Hogges, to whom they lost twice. Almir Barbosa was New Hampshire's top scorer for the second year in a row, with 6 goals, while Thomas McNeil contributed 2 assists.\n\nIn an attempt to consolidate their finances and restructure their organization, the Phantoms took voluntary relegation from the USL Second Division to the Premier Development League at the end of 2007.\n\nThe club's transition into the PDL began with an inconsistent run of performances, however after reaching the regional finals in 2014 the Phantoms have now established themselves as a force within the North East Division. In 2016 they appointed Alistair Bain as their new head coach, who arrives from GPS Portland Phoenix having had a very successful 7-year tenure in charge.\n\n\"This list of notable former players comprises players who went on to play professional soccer after playing for the team in the Premier Development League, or those who previously played professionally before joining the team.\"\n\n\n\n\nAttendance stats are calculated by averaging each team's self-reported home attendances from the historical match archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20100105175057/http://www.uslsoccer.com/history/index_E.html.\n\n"}

Founded in 2005, the team played in the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, in the Great Lakes Division of the Central Conference.\n\nThe Cincinnati Kings indoor team was founded in 2008. The club was formed to provide year-round professional soccer in Cincinnati.\n\nThe team played its home games at the Town and Country Sports Complex in nearby Wilder, Kentucky, where they played starting in 2007. The team's colors were red and black.\n\nThe Cincinnati Kings first entered the USL Second Division in 2005, under the leadership of Yacoub Abdallahi, an entrepreneur from Mauritania in Africa who graduated from Northern Kentucky University, and player-manager Jon Pickup, a former English U-16 international, who played professionally in England with Wigan Athletic, Blackburn Rovers and Chester City. From their home at Corcoran Field on the campus of Xavier University, the Kings made an immediate splash in the league, remaining unbeaten in their first five games, and enjoying a comprehensive 5–0 win over Northern Virginia Royals in just their second ever competitive match. However, Cincinnati's mid-season form stuttered slightly; the Kings lost four in a row, conceding a late goal against Long Island Rough Riders, and giving Wilmington Hammerheads and own-goal winner in the first game of June. Even their first foray into the US Open Cup was a disappointing one, as they shockingly lost 4–2 in the first round to Indianapolis-based USASA amateur side Reggae Boyz. This, really, remained the story for much of the rest of the season. Xavier University was not the fortress they needed it to be, and despite an away win over Charlotte Eagles in early July, and a 4–1 thrashing of Northern Virginia Royals on the last day of the season, the Kings finished their first year in 5th place behind regular season champions Western Mass Pioneers. George Kithas was the top scorer with 5 goals; Jack Cummings and Tiest Sondaal were the top assist providers with three each.\n\n2006 was a slight improvement for the Kings. Despite losing their opening two fixtures, the Kings nevertheless became a tough team to beat, and enjoyed improved home form throughout the season. The Kings' main problem was a lack of consistency, and their inability to build any kind of unbeaten momentum – their strongest run of form coming towards the end of July when they rattled off four wins in a row, including two 4-goal hauls against Long Island Rough Riders. Most of the rest of the time, however, win followed loss followed win followed loss, and all the while the Kings lost ground on the teams ahead of them. For the second consecutive year the Kings' US Open Cup run was a short one, going out at the first hurdle with a 2–1 loss to PDL side Michigan Bucks. However, despite losing their final two regular season games of the year to Pittsburgh Riverhounds and Western Mass Pioneers, their results were enough to leave them in fourth place in the table, and in the playoffs. They were drawn against Richmond Kickers in the semi final; Richmond took the first leg at home in Virginia 2–1, and despite a home crowd of 1,465, and despite outshooting the Kickers, the Kings simply couldn't find the net in the second leg, and Richmond went through to the final 2–1 on aggregate. Jeff Hughes and John Krause were Cincinnati's top scorers, with 4 goals each, Nowaf Jaman contributed 4 assists, and head coach Pickup was named USL2 Manager of the Year.\n\n2007, however, was tough all round for the Ohioans. The year started positively with a move away from University accommodation to the Town and Country Sports Club, just across the border in Wilder, Kentucky, which owner Yacoub purchased as the Kings' permanent home for $11.3 million. On the field, however, the Kings' fortunes were much less favorable. The Kings only managed two wins – 1–0 over Crystal Palace Baltimore and 4–0 over New Hampshire Phantoms – in their first ten games, and by the end of June were already struggling to remain in contention for the playoffs. For the third year in a row the Kings' US Open Cup run lasted just one game, as they lost to a USASA side for the second time – this time a 1–0 defeat to National Premier Soccer League team Milwaukee Bavarians – and this seemed to signal Cincinnati's doom for the rest of the season. The Kings just managed to win just two more regular season games – 1–0 over Richmond Kickers in July and 3–1 over New Hampshire Phantoms on the last day of the season – eventually finishing a distant 8th in the table. Chad Eckerlin and Byron Neal did score 13 goals between them, but on the whole it was a hugely disappointing season for the Kings.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2008 season, it was announced that the Kings would be taking voluntary relegation, and would henceforth be competing in the USL Premier Development League.\n\nThe Kings' first season in the PDL did not go entirely to plan, despite winning their opening game 1–0 over the Indiana Invaders. The Kings lost five of their next six games, dropping 3–0 to Ohio rivals Cleveland Internationals, and only just scraping past West Virginia Chaos 2–1 off a late, late winner from Braden Bishop. Things didn't get much better during the middle of the season; Cleveland compounded their state superiority with a thumping 5–1 win at the end of July, and although the Kings managed to hold perennial powerhouses Chicago Fire Premier to a goalless draw, and pick up another win over West Virginia, things were generally fairly grim. The Kings were out of the playoff race by mid-August, and dropped three of their last five games, including a 0–4 loss to Toronto Lynx on the final day of the season. Thy eventually finished fourth in their division, almost 30 points behind league-leaders Michigan Bucks; Branden Stelmak was the top scorer, the 5 goals on the season.\n\n2009 was not much better for the Kings. In their second season in the amateur ranks they managed just four wins in a difficult season – a 2–0 win over the Indiana Invaders in May, a pair of 3–1 wins over Fort Wayne Fever in June, and a 3–2 win over Toronto Lynx in July in which substitute Judson McKinney scored a last minute winner. The rest of the year was a disappointment, especially on the defensive end; they conceded three goals on five separate occasions, including four of their first five games of the season. Their worst defeat of the season was the 5–1 thrashing they suffered at the hands of Chicago Fire Premier in July. The Kings finished the season in 8th place in the Great Lakes division, decisively out of the playoffs; Judson McKinney was the team's top scorer, with four goals, while Aaron Miller and Jonathan Sutton contributed two assists each.\n\n\"As of June 7, 2011.\"\n\n\"This list of notable former players comprises players who went on to play professional soccer after playing for the team in the Premier Development League, or those who previously played professionally before joining the team.\"\n\n\n\nAttendance stats are calculated by averaging each team's self-reported home attendances from the historical match archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20100105175057/http://www.uslsoccer.com/history/index_E.html\n\n\nIn 2006 the Cincinnati Kings supporters founded a group dubbed 'The Pride', inspired by the lion in the club's crest.

It was devised and granted by the College of Heralds of England.\nThe shield itself has a green background. This represents the 'champs' (French for 'field') in the word \"Champlain\", a reference to the explorer's expedition through the Peterborough area in 1615. The green can also refer to the Emerald Isle, from which the first Irish immigrants were brought under the direction of the Peter Robinson in 1825. It also refers to the fields and forests of the area.\nThe sword refers to the British soldiers and officers who fought in the Napoleonic Wars and in the War of 1812, and were granted tracts of land in the Peterborough region. The wavy blue-and-white bars signify the Otonabee River that cuts through the city, as well as the other numerous lakes and rivers in the area.\n\nThe crest above Peterborough's shield of arms is mounted on a wreath of the two chief colours of the shield, green and silver. On a log of wood cross-wise is a Canadian beaver, grasping in its left (sinister) forepaw a gold key pointing upwards and to the left. This is to represent the key of St. Peter, a tribute to the Roman Catholic third of the city's population, to the religion of the Irish immigrants, and to 'Peter' in the city's name.\n\nThe supporters of the shield represent the history and nature of Peterborough. The stag on the left-hand side is symbolic of Peterborough's natural surroundings. On the right-hand side is a red lion with its neck encircled by a golden crown chained over its back. The lion is taken from the Duke of Wellington's arms, as it was under him that many officers and men settled the area.\n\nThe green mound under the shield and supporters refers to the pastoral nature of the country south of the city. The city of Peterborough's motto, \"Nature Provides, Industry Develops\", is interpretively translated into Latin (\"Dat Natura, Elaborant Artes\"), which in turn broadly means that Nature gives bountifully and the crafts and energy of the people elaborate nature's gift.\n\nSource: The City of Peterborough website\n"}
{"id": "1939252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939252", "title": "Brown-tail moth", "text": "Brown-tail moth\n\nThe brown-tail moth (\"Euproctis chrysorrhoea\") is a moth of the family Erebidae. It is native to Europe, neighboring countries in Asia, and the north coast of Africa. Descriptions of outbreaks, i.e., large population increases of several years duration, have been reported as far back as the 1500s. The life cycle of the moth is atypical, in that it spends approximately nine months (August to April) as larvae (caterpillars), leaving about one month each for pupae, imagos and eggs. Larvae (caterpillars) are covered in hairs. Two red spots on the back, toward the tail, distinguish these species from other similarly hairy moth larvae. The winged adults have white wings and a hairy white body with a tuft of brown hair at the tip of the abdomen. Females lay one egg cluster, usually on the underside of a leaf of a host plant. The species is polyphagous, meaning that it feeds on many different species of trees, including pear, apple, maple and oak.\n\nThis species was accidentally introduced to the United States in the 1890s. During the early 20th century it was present from eastern Connecticut northward into New Brunswick, Canada, but a subsequent severe population collapse reduced the territory to parts of coastal Maine and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, by the late 20th century. One theory for the decline appeared to be parasitism by a fly introduced to combat gypsy moths. Starting in 2015 there has been a population spike and territory expansion in coastal Maine. In Europe, there are multiple parasitic and predator species, yet there is still a history of population outbreaks. \n\nHairs from the caterpillars are toxic for humans, causing a poison ivy-like itchy rash of up to weeks' duration due to mechanical and chemical irritation. Direct contact with larvae is not necessary, as the hairs are shed and can become windblown. Toxins in the hairs remain potent for up to three years. Outdoor activities such as mowing a lawn or raking leaves in the fall can cause exposure.\n\nThe upper surface of the wings of this species is pure white. Males may have some brown color on the underside of the forewing. Wingspan is . The body is very hairy and white except for the tail which is covered in reddish-brown hairs, much more prominent in the females. Males have larger antennae, used to detect pheromones released by unmated females. Females have a larger body. As winged adults, this species is superficially similar in appearance to \"Euproctis similis\" (native to Europe) and \"Hyphantria cunea\" (native to North America), but female \"E. similis\" have a yellow tail tuft and \"H. cunea\" lacks tail tuft coloration.\n\nThe female lays one cluster of 200 to 400 eggs, typically on the underside of a leaf. The egg cluster is covered with hairs from her anal tuft. The larva is very hairy, brown with white markings, and two prominent red spots toward the tail end. The hairs provide protection from predators; the larva incorporates some into the cocoon within which it pupates. The species overwinters communally as larvae within a tough, silken tent constructed around branch-tip leaves and anchored to twigs. In areas where the species is abundant, these tents are a familiar sight, and can be seen on a huge range of plants, especially in late fall and winter when unaffected leaves have fallen.\n\nThis species can be found throughout Europe, except in the most northern countries, also in the westernmost countries of Asia, such as Turkey, Syria and Israel, and the countries across the northern parts of Africa. Charles H. Fernald and Archie H. Kirkland recount historic mentions of brown-tail moths dating back to 1500s, describing outbreaks in Paris, London and Berlin so severe as to completely strip all trees of leaves. Carl Linnaeus described the species in the tenth edition (1758) of \"Systema Naturae\".\n\nThe brown-tail moth is an invasive species in the United States and Canada, having arrived in Somerville, Massachusetts, circa 1890 and becoming widespread there and in neighboring Cambridge by 1897. Initial outbreaks were most evident in pear and apple trees. Doctors reported \"poisonings\" (skin rash) far worse than poison ivy rash. Within a few years it was seen as a serious, fast-spreading, horticultural and health problem. Through the early parts of the 20th century it was present in much of New England from eastern Connecticut to Maine, and northward into New Brunswick, Canada, but the 1906 introduction of the parasitic tachnid fly \"Compsilura concinnata\" to counter gypsy moths collaterally impacted brown-tail moths. By the late 20th century the habitat was reduced to the coast and islands of Maine, and also parts of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Cold and wet weather hinders re-expansion of the population outside its current territories, although starting in 2015 there has been a population spike and territory expansion in coastal Maine, from Portland to Bar Harbor. In addition to North America, there have been reports of this species appearing in China, Japan and New Guinea.\n\nPhotographs taken from aerial fly-overs are used to identify areas where the trees have been denuded of leaves and where the branch-tip tents are present. The female sex hormone has been synthesized and field-tested in moth traps as a means of monitoring moth populations during the June/July flight season. The white-winged adults are nocturnal and strongly attracted to light; a report from 1903 likened their appearance around streetlights as being akin to heavy snowfall.\n\nThe brown-tail moth produces one generation a year. It has four life stages; egg, larval, pupal, and adult. Eggs are laid in July and hatch in August. The annual cycle is approximately one month as eggs, nine months as larvae, one month as pupae, and one month as imagoes (winged, sexually mature adults).\n\nIn the United States, many species of birds prey on the winged adults, including English house sparrow and blue jay. A review of mortality causes in England and mainland Europe described the brown-tail moth as undergoing periodic population outbreaks, each developing rapidly and lasting for several years, followed by a decline to relative obscurity. In a study conducted in England, egg, larvae and pupae deaths were attributed to several parasites, including microsporidia, cytoplasmic and nuclear viruses, and larvae predation by birds, specifically identifying the common cuckoo (\"Cuculus canorus\") and titmice. A more recent review, conducted in Spain, identified 17 species of parasites, viral diseases, unspecified predation and other, unknown, causes of death spanning from eggs not hatching, during summer, winter and spring as larvae, finishing with pupae failing to produce winged adults. Generally, mortality increased with population density, although in outbreak regions there was some compensation by females laying 21.6% more eggs (cause not discussed). \n\n\"Compsilura concinnata\", a parasitic fly, pierces the brown-tail moth larva and deposits its own larva inside. This fly was introduced to North America in 1906 in an attempt to counter gypsy moth, an invasive species. While not entirely successful for that purpose, one research group concluded that introduction of this fly had a great impact on brown-tail moths while not being as effective on gypsy moths, the reason being that the fly larvae need to over-winter inside a host larvae. (Brown-tail moths over-winter as larvae, whereas gypsy moths over-winter as eggs.) The effectiveness of \"C. concinnata\" may be compromised by hyperparasitism of the fly by a species of trigonalid wasp. An older review describes other fly species that were confirmed as brown-tail moth larvae parasites, then released in U.S.: \"Apanteles lacteicolor\", \"Metrous versicolor\" and \"Sturmia nidicola\".\n\nBranch-tip webs can be clipped in winter and very early spring, and either dropped into a bucket of soapy water or burned. Gloves should be worn. Appropriate pesticides should be applied before early May because that is when the larvae start to develop harmful hairs. For organic garden and farm situations there are sprays that use a strain of \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" (Bt).\n\nCicely Blair wrote a paper about the rash caused by the brown-tail moth caterpillar in the British Isles. It, and other descriptions, confirmed that loose hairs can break off and cause very itchy rashes on contact with skin, as well as breathing difficulties similar to asthma if inhaled. Rashes can persist for weeks. The same symptoms have been reported as far back as 1903. The reactions are due to a combination of mechanical and chemical stimuli, the barbed hairs in effect becoming lodged in and physically irritating the skin, and also functioning as microtubules to introduce irritating chemical compounds that have hydrolase, esterase and hemolytic activity. This rash reaction may be referred to as lepidopterism. The species should be handled using protective gloves at all stages of its life cycle. Shed hairs blow about, and can be brought indoors on clothing and shoes, so rashes can occur without the victim coming in direct contact with the caterpillars. The toxins in the hairs remain potent for up to three years after being shed. Outdoor activities such as mowing a lawn or raking leaves in the fall can cause exposure. \n\nA related species, mistletoe browntail moth (\"Euproctis edwardsi\"), has been reported as causing a similar rash in Australia, in people working at or visiting a community center, attributed to caterpillars feeding on a tree outside the building. In addition to brown-tail and mistletoe browntail, several other \"Euproctis\" species are identified as causing rashes in humans, including \"Euproctis baliolalis\", \"Euproctis limbalis\" and \"Euproctis lutea\" (all three native to Australia). Urticating hairs, i.e., itch and rash-producing, are also reported for caterpillars of other moth and butterfly species.\n\nBrown-tail larvae have been reported as feeding on 26 genera of non-resinous trees and shrubs belonging to 13 different families. This polyphagy is considered unusual. Non-specific host plant feeding combined with its tendency to reach extreme outbreak densities makes this species a major pest of fruit orchards, ornamental trees and hardwood forests. Partial list of plant species: apple, cherry, beach plum (Cape Cod, Massachusetts), beech, elm, grape, hops, maple, oak, pear, raspberry, rose and willow. An early description of the introduction to the United States in the 1890s identified pear and apple trees as most greatly afflicted, but mentioned that once trees were entirely bare of leaves, the larvae would descend to the ground in great numbers and move toward any leafy plant, including vegetable plants.\n\n"}

He played most of his career for Czech club Bohemians Prague. Panenka won UEFA Euro 1976 with Czechoslovakia. In the final against West Germany, he scored the winning penalty in the shootout with a softly-chipped ball up the middle of the goal as the goalkeeper dived away; this style of penalty is now called the Panenka penalty. In 1980, he won Czechoslovak Footballer of the Year and his team finished third at Euro 1980.\n\nAn attacking midfielder known for the quality of his passing and his free kicks, Panenka played for Bohemians Praha for most of his career, joining the club in 1967. In 1981, Panenka left Bohemians for Austrian club Rapid Wien, where he won two Bundesliga titles and an Austrian Cup. In 1985 Rapid reached the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final; Panenka played as a substitute, but his side lost 3–1 to Everton. Later that year, Panenka moved to VSE St. Pölten and played two more seasons before moving into the lower leagues in Austria, playing from 1987–89 for Slovan Vienna, from 1989–91 for ASV Hohenau and from 1991–93 for Kleinwiesendorf.\n\nPanenka came to international prominence playing for Czechoslovakia at UEFA Euro 1976, where Czechoslovakia reached the final, facing West Germany. After extra time, the match finished 2–2, and so the first penalty shootout in a European Championships final ensued. The first seven kicks were converted until West Germany's fourth penalty taker, Uli Hoeneß, ballooned his shot over the bar. With the score 4–3, Panenka stepped up to take the fifth Czechoslovakian penalty, to win the match under immense pressure. He feigned shooting to the side of the goal, causing German goalkeeper Sepp Maier dive to his left, and then gently chipped the ball into the middle of the net. The sheer cheek of the goal led a watching French journalist to dub Panenka \"a poet\", and to this day his winning kick is one of the most famous ever, making Panenka's name synonymous with that particular style of penalty kick.\n\nSince 1976 there have been numerous attempts to emulate Panenka, both successfully and others unsuccessfully, at every level of the sporting pyramid across the world, including in critical match winning moments such as international cup finals.\n\nToday, Panenka works as a president of Bohemians 1905.\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the 1941 census of India, there were 5.9 million non-Muslims in the provinces that today form Pakistan. During and after Pakistan's independence in 1947, about 5 million Hindus and Sikhs emigrated, with Punjab alone accounting for migration of 3.9 million. 14.2% of Pakistan's total population, including Bangladesh, was non-Muslim minorities according to 1951 census. In 1951, the Non-Muslim minorities population was 23.44% in Pakistan while in Bangladesh, the Non-Muslims had a majority share comprising 30.20 per cent of the total population in Bangladesh. After the partition, non-Muslims formed about a quarter of East Bengal's population and 14% overall.\n\nBy 1997, the percentage of Hindus remained stable at 1.85% in Pakistan, while Bangladesh has witnessed a decline with Hindus migrating from it because of insecurity due to fear of persecution, conflict, communal violence (as a result of newly-created Bangladesh's assertion of its Muslim identity) and poverty. The percentage of Hindus in Bangladesh had dropped to 9.2% by 2011, with non-Muslims accounting for 10.2%\nof the population.\n\nMuch of the decrease in minorities of Pakistan has occurred due to the events around the partition, the wars of 1965 and 1971. Various causes like religious violence and forced conversions are attributed as responsible for decline of minorities. Forced conversions and marriages represent a significant threat to underage girls in Pakistan. Around 1000 girls belonging to religious minorities were estimated to be forcibly converted every year according to NGOs. In November 2019, Pakistan formed parliamentary committee to stop the act of forced conversion in the country. However according to \"\"[t]he All Pakistan Hindu Panchayat (APHP)...[the] majority of cases of marriages between Hindu women and Muslim men were result of love affairs. It said due to honour, the family members of women concoct stories of abduction and forced conversions\"\".\n\nAccording to Western religious freedom and human rights monitoring groups, religious minorities face severe discrimination in Pakistan.\n\nIn 2012, according to the Government of Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), the population of officially registered religious minorities in Pakistan was as follows:\n\n\nAccording to the 1951 census conducted by the Government of Pakistan, West Pakistan had 1.6% Hindu population, while East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had 22.05%.\n\nAccording to the 1998 census conducted by the Government of Pakistan, Hindus made up 1.85% of the population and Christians (Protestant and Roman Catholic) 1.59%, or around 3.2million people. Other estimates put the numbers higher. Historically, there was also a small contingent of Jews in Pakistan who emigrated to Israel in 1948.\n\nThe U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report 2002 estimates the Shi'a population between 10-12%, among which around 900,000 are Ismailis which is a sect of Shi'i Muslims and who pay tribute to their living spiritual leader, the Aga Khan. It also lists Christians at 2.09 million; Hindus at 1.03 million; Parsis, Buddhists, and Sikhs at 20,000 each; and Baha'is at 30,000.\n\nIn a 2011 book, Ishtiaq Ahmed wrote that \"Some independent studies, however, suggest that the non-Muslims population of Pakistan is nearly 10 per cent and Hindus, Christians and Ahmadis make up four million each. It is generally noted that while majorities play down minority figures, the minorities inflate them. This is especially true of the Ahmadiyya community. Official statistics return less than 150,000 for them while the Ahmadis claim to be around ten million.\"\n\nMuch of the decrease in minorities of Pakistan has occurred due to the events around the partition, the wars of 1965 and 1971. 2019 Religious Minorities in Pakistan report compiled by Members of the European Parliament also attributes reasons like religious violence and forced conversions as a cause of decline. In November 2019, Pakistan formed parliamentary committee to stop the act of forced conversion in the country.\n\nIn 1995, the Parsis put their number at 2,831.\n\nPakistan's Blasphemy law stems from section 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code (6 October 1860) XLV of 1860. It states that whoever \"defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.\" This law is phrased in vague terms (therefore violating the principle of legality), and is often used to level false accusations at people from religious minorities. Asia Bibi is a notable example of a person against whom such a violation occurred. Victims of these false accusations are often presumed guilty, and can be convicted without substantive evidence. \n\nIndependent human rights organisation Global Human Rights Defence receives a number of cases each month from the representatives of victims of the blasphemy law.\n\nAccording to the 2012 United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) annual report, \"The government of Pakistan continues to engage in and tolerate systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief.\" The USCIRF has designated Pakistan as \"country of particular concern\" since 2002. The report argues that \"The country’s blasphemy laws, used predominantly in Punjab but also nationwide, target members of religious minority communities and dissenting Muslims and this frequently results in imprisonment. The USCIRF is aware of at least 16 individuals on death row and 20 more serving life sentences. The blasphemy law, along with anti-Ahmadi laws that effectively criminalise various practices of their faith, has created a climate of vigilante violence. Hindus have suffered from the climate of violence and hundreds have fled Pakistan for India.\"\n\nFarahnaz Ispahani who was the media advisor to the President of Pakistan from 2008 to 2012, has blamed the successive Pakistani governments of pursuing a \"slow genocide\" against minorities to shore up their political base. A BBC FAQ notes that \"Beginning in 1980, a slew of clauses was added to the chapter of religious offences in the Pakistan Penal Code. These clauses can be grouped into two categories - the anti-Ahmadi laws and the blasphemy laws.\" The BBC notes that three is widespread popular support for these laws in Pakistan, and that two prominent critics of these laws, Salman Taseer and Shahbaz Bhatti, have been assassinated in 2011. Regarding the blasphemy laws, the BBC observes that: \"Hundreds of Christians are among the accused - at least 12 of them were given the death sentence for blaspheming against the Prophet.\"\n\nMass anti-Christian violence recently occurred in the 2009 Gojra riots and in the 2013 Joseph Colony riot and the 2013 Gujranwala riot. Recent anti-Shia violence includes the February 2012 Kohistan Shia Massacre, the August 2012 Mansehra Shia Massacre and the particularly deadly January 2013 and February 2013 Quetta bombings. The Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan was targeted in the similarly deadly May 2010 attacks on Ahmadi mosques in Lahore.\n\nA survey carried out by All Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement Pakistan's revealed that out of 428 Hindu temples in Pakistan only around 20 survive today and they remain neglected by the Evacuee Trust Property Board which controls those while the rest had been converted for other uses since 1990. However, in November 2019, government of Pakistan started restoring process for 400 Hindu temples in Pakistan. After restoration, the temples will be reopened to Hindus in Pakistan.\n\n\n"}

Many past bearers of the title were homemakers, albeit as hostesses of Malacañang Palace; Ramos raised some eyebrows in conservative circles when, after her husband's accession following the three-way 1992 elections, she refused to resign as registrar at the International School Manila's old Makati campus. Despite her new, exalted rank as consort to the head of state, she dutifully reported to the registrar's office much to the delight of female professionals.\n\nShe was a particularly visible advocate of sport, a field outside the traditional realm of First Ladies. An active sportswoman herself, she was most associated with badminton, having served as president of the Philippine Badminton Association. Her achievements in the environmental field are considerable as well, having campaigned for the rehabilitation and conservation of the Pasig River, which received prominent attention during her husband's rule. She continues to be active in efforts devoted to the Pasig.\n\nAside from being a sportswoman, Ramos is also recognised as a talented amateur pianist, performing on several occasions with the Executive Combo Band of Raul Manglapus. She also received considerable public sympathy in 1993, when the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" published a front-page story revealing an alleged past affair between her husband and the socialite Baby Arenas. Ramos kept a dignified silence, and the scandal has had no visible impact on her decades-long marriage.\n\nIn the early hours of 27 January 2011, Ramos' daughter, Josephine Ramos-Samartino, died of lung cancer at the age of 54 at The Medical City in Pasig, Metro Manila.

Buckingham employed his expertise in English racing car and aircraft design in the manufacturing of new Australian racing cars. He used aircraft technology to help build triangulated, multi-tubular, space framed racing cars, which had in the past been seen in Australia only as imported automobiles.\n\nBefore going to Australia, Buckingham took on the skills he learned in the RAF through aeronautical engineering to build along with a team, a light weight car to take place in a 6-hour race at Silverstone against the likes of Jaguar, Healey, Aston Martin, etc. and won.\n\nWhile in Australia, among numerous other car design and manufacture projects, Guy built five Formula Junior class racing cars. The first two are the only Australian-built front engine cars. These still exist and are known as the \"89\" and \"90\" cars. The 1959 car won the first FJ race held in Australia at Warwick Farm with Buckingham as the driver. Their history was short, racing through to 1963/4. The 89 car has a continuous history to the present day. The 90 car was never raced from 1964 onwards until it was rebuilt in 2004. They are raced under the historic register HSRCA in Australia as 1959 and 1960 Nota FJ. The third car was rear engined Nota FJ Renault, History unknown. This car was owned by Ian Cook 1970 till 1972 and raced at Oran Park and Amaroo as a Formula 3 and was not that reliable motor wise. Cook then sold it on to Peter Taylor who with Brian Morrow lengthened the chassis by 70 mm to suit Peter's 1850 mm height and fitted it with a Toyota 1198cc engine built by McGrath in Victoria the car went well at Oran Park and Amaroo until Peter sold it on.

While they had originally planned on naming the new entity \"Daggville,\" after the name of a pioneer family, they opted instead to name it \"Shawville\" after James Shaw promised to donate 0.8 ha of land to the new municipality. Shawville was officially established in 1874 and was populated by Irish Protestant immigrants. Shaw, who had settled in the area in 1843, was the first mayor, serving from 1856 to 1877.\n\nThe municipality has a Methodist church that was built in Shawville in 1835, while the Catholic Parish of Saint-Alexandre-de-Clarendon opened its doors in 1840. This church would later be renamed as Sainte-Mélanie, and still later as Saint-Jacques-le-Majeur in 1917.\n\nIn recent times, Shawville has been the site of several conflicts between local shopkeepers and the Office québécois de la langue française over the province's language laws.\n\nThe town is completely enclosed within the municipality of Clarendon. Shawville is situated approximately west of Gatineau and southeast of Fort-Coulonge.\n\nShawville is an overwhelmingly anglophone (with 85 percent of its residents listing English as their first language in the Canada 2006 Census) and Protestant (75%) community. This is unusual in Quebec, a province that is overwhelmingly French-speaking and Roman Catholic. The population has been known to quite literally run the so-called \"language police\" \"out of town\" in defiance of the Charter of the French Language.\n\nThe town is characterized by its red-brick buildings, and unlike nearly every other municipality in Quebec, it has no Catholic church. Shawville is home to an elementary school, a high school, a regional hospital, and the SRPC national head office. Its businesses are mostly small and family-run.\n\nThe Shawville Fair, held the first weekend in September, is the town's major event. It has run every year since 1856 and includes typical county fair features such as livestock shows, auctions, truck pulls, demolition derbies, art/craft/hobby shows, diverse food stands and a midway. In recent years, it has drawn headline entertainers such as Terri Clark, Stompin' Tom Connors, Paul Brandt, April Wine, Dean Brody and Corb Lund, with total attendance reaching around 50,000. It will not run for the first time in its history in 2020, amid fears of Covid-19.\n\nShawville is represented in the Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League by the Shawville Pontiacs.\n\nFamous people from Shawville include the former general manager of the Ottawa Senators, Bryan Murray, Terry Murray (current assistant coach of the Buffalo Sabres and former coach of the L.A. Kings), Tim Murray (former general manager of the Buffalo Sabres), NHL legend Frank \"The Shawville Express\" Finnigan and race horse owner and lawyer Clay Horner. Former NHL referee Blaine Angus also comes from the area.\nRay Harris, a prominent singer-songwriter in the Ottawa area, was raised in Shawville and later wrote the song \"Shawville Girl\". In addition to this, former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark has a residence on Main Street and volunteers at the annual fair.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939300", "title": "Women in Pakistan", "text": "Women in Pakistan\n\nThe status of women in Pakistan is one of systemic gender subordination even though it varies considerably across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide due to uneven socioeconomic development and the impact of tribal, feudal, and capitalist social formations on women's lives. Many religious groups in Pakistan, who have had more political power since the Zia-ul-Haq regime in the 1980s, advocate subordination of women in Pakistan. Even rape victims have not been allowed to use DNA evidence to prove their cases. All Pakistan Ulema Council recently issued fatwas denouncing \"honour killings\". Other improvements are also being made as Lahore has inaugurated its first service of lady traffic wardens to manage the traffic and the country's most conservative province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, is planning to increase the percentage of women in the police force.\n\nEven with these improvements, rampant domestic abuse and a high rate of child marriages and forced marriages still remain.\n\nPakistan has a dual system of civil and sharia law. The Constitution of Pakistan recognizes equality between men and women (Art. 25(2) states \"There shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex\") but also recognizes as valid Sharia law (Chapter 3A. – Federal Shariat Court). In Pakistan, women have held high offices including that of the Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Assembly, Leader of the Opposition, as well as federal ministers, judges, and serving commissioned posts in the armed forces. Major General Shahida Malik, attaining the highest military post for a woman.\n\nHistorically, Muslim reformers such as Syed Ahmad Khan tried to bring education to women, limit polygamy, and empower women in other ways through education. The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was known to have a positive attitude towards women. After the independence of Pakistan, women's groups and feminist organisations started by prominent leaders like Fatima Jinnah started to form that worked to eliminate socio-economic injustices against women in the country.\n\nJinnah points out that Muslim women leaders from all classes actively supported the Pakistan movement in the mid-1940s. Their movement was led by wives and other relatives of leading politicians. Women were sometimes organised into large-scale public demonstrations. Before 1947 there was a tendency for the Muslim women in Punjab to vote for the Muslim League while their menfolk supported the Unionist Party.\n\nMany Muslim women supported the Indian National Congress Quit India Movement. Some like Syeda Safia Begum of Muslim Town Lahore started the first English School for Muslim Children in Muslim Town in 1935.\nPakistani women were granted the suffrage in 1947, and they were reaffirmed the right to vote in national elections in 1956 under the interim Constitution. The provision of reservation of seats for women in the Parliament existed throughout the constitutional history of Pakistan from 1956 to 1973.\n\nHad General Ayub Khan run fair elections, Ms. Fatima Jinnah of Pakistan would have become the first Muslim President of the largest Muslim country in the world. However, despite that setback, during 1950–60, several pro-women initiatives were taken. Also the first woman Lambardar or Numberdar (Village Head Person) in West Pakistan Begum Sarwat Imtiaz took oath in Village 43/12-L in Chichawatni, District Montgomery (now Sahiwal) in 1959. The 1961 Muslim Family Law Ordinance, which regulated marriage, divorce, and polygamy continues to have a significant legal impact on the women of Pakistan.\n\nThe regime of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1970–1977) was a period of liberal attitudes towards women. All government services were opened to women including the district management group and the foreign service (in the civil service), which had been denied to them earlier. About 10% of the seats in the National Assembly and 5% in the provincial assemblies were reserved for women, with no restriction on contesting general seats as well. However, the implementation of these policies was poor as the Government faced a financial crisis due to the war with India and consequent split of the country.\n\nGender equality was specifically guaranteed in the Constitution of Pakistan adopted in 1973. The constitution stipulates that \"there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex alone.\" The Constitution additionally affords the protection of marriage, family, the mother and the child as well as ensuring \"full participation of women in all spheres of national life.\". However, many judges upheld the \"laws of Islam\", often misinterpreted, over the Constitution's guarantee of non-discrimination and equality under the law.\n\nIn 1975, an official delegation from Pakistan participated in the First World Conference on Women in Mexico, which led to the constitution of the first Pakistan Women's Rights Committee.\n\nGeneral Zia ul-Haq, then Army Chief of Staff, overthrew the democratically elected Zulfikar Ali Bhutto government in a military coup on 5 July 1977. The Sixth Plan during the martial law régime of General Zia-ul-Haq (1977–1986) was full of policy contradictions. The régime took many steps toward institutional building for women's development, such as the establishment of the Women's Division in the Cabinet Secretariat, and the appointment of another commission on the Status of Women. A chapter on women in development was included for the first time in the Sixth Plan. The chapter was prepared by a working group of 28 professional women headed by Syeda Abida Hussain, chairperson of the Jhang District council at that time. The main objective as stated in the Sixth Plan was \"to adopt an integrated approach to improve women's status\". In 1981, General Zia-ul-Haq nominated the \"Majlis-e-Shoora\" (Federal Advisory Council) and inducted 20 women as members, however Majlis-e-Shoora had no power over the executive branch. In 1985, the National Assembly elected through nonparty elections doubled women's reserved quota (20 percent).\n\nHowever, Zia-ul-Haq initiated a process of Islamization by introducing discriminatory legislation against women such as the set of Hudood Ordinances and the \"Qanun-e-Shahadat\" Order (Law of Evidence Order). He banned women from participating and from being spectators of sports and promoted purdah. He suspended all fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution that had been adopted in 1973, including the right to be free of discrimination on the basis of sex. He also proposed laws regarding Qisas and Diyat, Islamic penal laws governing retribution (\"qisas\") and compensation (\"diyat\") in crimes involving bodily injury. When the victim was a woman, the amount of \"diyat\" was halved\n\nThe Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 was a subcategory of the Hudood Ordinance. \"Zina\" is the crime of non-marital sexual relations and adultery. The Zina Ordinance included \"zina-bil-jabr\", the category of forced intercourse. If the woman who accuses a man of \"zina-bil-jabr\" (rape) cannot prove to the judicial system that she was raped, she faces adultery charges. In order for a rapist to receive \"hadd,\" the maximum punishment provided for under the Quran, either the rapist must confess to the rape, or four pious adult Muslim men must witness the \"act of penetration\" itself and testify against the rapist.\n\nUnder \"Qanun-e-Shahadat\", a woman's testimony was not weighed equally to that of a man. Thus, if a woman does not have male witnesses but does have female witnesses, their testimony would not satisfy the evidence requirement. The perpetrator may be acquitted and the victim may face adultery charges. The threat of being prosecuted discourages victims from filing complaints.\n\nIn addition, the legal possibility of marital rape was eliminated; by definition, rape became an extramarital offence according to the Zina ordinance. The ordinance prompted international criticism. Women's rights groups helped in the production of a film titled \"Who will cast the first stone?\" filmmaker by Sabiha Sumar to highlight the oppression and sufferings of women under the Hudood Ordinances.\n\nIn September 1981, the first conviction and sentence under the Zina Ordinance, of stoning to death for Fehmida and Allah Bakhsh were set aside under national and international pressure. In September 1981, women came together in Karachi in an emergency meeting to oppose the adverse effects on women of martial law and the Islamization campaign. They launched what later became the first full-fledged national women's movement in Pakistan, the Women’s Action Forum (WAF). WAF staged public protests and campaigns against the Hudood Ordinances, the Law of Evidence, and the Qisas and Diyat laws (temporarily shelved as a result).\n\nIn 1983, an orphaned, thirteen-year-old girl Jehan Mina was allegedly raped by her uncle and his sons, and became pregnant. She was unable to provide enough evidence that she was raped. She was charged with adultery and the court considered her pregnancy as the proof of adultery. She was awarded the \"Tazir\" punishment of one hundred lashes and three years of rigorous imprisonment.\n\nIn 1983, Safia Bibi, a nearly blind teenaged domestic servant was allegedly raped by her employer and his son. Due to lack of evidence, she was convicted for adultery under the Zina ordinance, while the rapists were acquitted. She was sentenced to fifteen lashes, five years imprisonment, and a fine of 1000 rupees. The decision attracted so much publicity and condemnation from the public and the press that the Federal Shariah Court of its own motion, called for the records of the case and ordered that she should be released from prison on her own bond. Subsequently, on appeal, the finding of the trial court was reversed and the conviction was set aside.\n\nThe International Commission of Jurists' December 1986 mission to Pakistan called for repeal of the sections of the Hudood Ordinances relating to crimes and of Islamic punishments that discriminate against women and non-Muslims.\n\nThere is considerable evidence that legislation during this period has negatively impacted Pakistani women's lives and made them more vulnerable to extreme violence. The majority of women in prison had been charged under the Hudood Ordinance. Similarly, a national study found that 21% of those residing in shelters for women (Darul Aman) had Hudood cases against them. According to a 1998 report by Amnesty International, more than one-third of all Pakistani women in prison were being held due to having been accused or found guilty of zina.\n\nAfter Zia-ul-Haq's regime, there was a visible change in the policy context in favour of women. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth plans formulated under various democratically elected governments have clearly made efforts to include women's concerns in the planning process. However, planned development failed to address gender inequalities due to the gap between policy intent and implementation.\n\nIn 1988, Benazir Bhutto (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's daughter) became the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan, and the first woman elected to head a Muslim country. During her election campaigns, she voiced concerns over social issues of women, health and discrimination against women. She also announced plans to set up women's police stations, courts and women's development banks. She also promised to repeal controversial Hudood laws that curtailed the rights of women However, during her two incomplete terms in office (1988–90 and 1993–96), Benazir Bhutto did not propose any legislation to improve welfare services for women. She was not able to repeal a single one of Zia-ul-Haq's Islamisation laws. By virtue of the eighth constitutional amendment imposed by Zia-ul-Haq, these laws were protected both from ordinary legislative modification and from judicial review.\n\nIn early 1988, the case of Shahida Parveen and Muhammad Sarwar sparked bitter public criticism. Shahida's first husband, Khushi Muhammad, had divorced her and the papers had been signed in front of a magistrate. The husband however, had not registered the divorce documents in the local council as required by law, rendering the divorce not legally binding. Unaware of this, Shahida, after her mandatory 96-day period of waiting (\"iddat\"), remarried. Her first husband, rebounding from a failed attempt at a second marriage, decided he wanted his first wife Shahida back. Shahida's second marriage was ruled invalid. She and her second husband, Sarwar were charged with adultery. They were sentenced to death by stoning. The public criticism led to their retrial and acquittal by the Federal Shariah Court.\n\nMinistry of Women's Development (MWD) established Women's Studies centres at five universities in Islamabad, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar, and Lahore in 1989. However, four of these centres became almost non-functional due to lack of financial and administrative support. Only the center at University of Karachi (funded by the Canadian International Development Agency) was able to run a master of arts programme.\n\nThe First Women Bank Ltd. (FWBL) was established in 1989 to address women's financial needs. FWBL, a nationalised commercial bank, was given the rôle of a development finance institution, as well as of a social welfare organisation. It operates 38 real-time online branches across the country, managed and run by women. MWD provided a credit line of Rs 48 million to FWBL to finance small-scale credit schemes for disadvantaged women. The Social Action Programme launched in 1992/93 aimed at reducing gender disparities by improving women's access to social services.\n\nPakistan acceded to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on 29 February 1996. The Ministry of Women Development (MWD) is the designated national focal machinery for its implementation. However MWD faced a lack of resources initially. Pakistan failed to submit its initial report that was due in 1997. Pakistan neither signed nor ratified the Optional Protocol of the Women's Convention, which has led to non-availability of avenues for filing grievances by individuals or groups against Pakistan under CEDAW.\n\nIn 1997, Nawaz Sharif was elected as the Prime Minister. He had also held office for a truncated term (1990–1993), during which he had promised to adopt Islamic law as the supreme law of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1997, the Nawaz Sharif government formally enacted the Qisas and Diyat Ordinance, which institutes shariah-based changes in Pakistan's criminal law. The ordinance had earlier been kept in force by invoking the president's power to re-issue it every four months.\n\nSharif then proposed a fifteenth amendment to the Constitution that would entirely replace the existing legal system with a comprehensive Islamic one and would override the \"constitution and any law or judgment of any court.\". The proposal was approved in the National Assembly (lower house), where Sharif's party has a commanding majority, but, it remained stalled in the Senate after facing strong opposition from women's groups, human rights activists, and opposition political parties.\n\nA 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court, in the highly publicised Saima Waheed case, upheld a woman's right to marry freely but called for amendments to the 1965 Family Laws, on the basis of Islamic norms, to enforce parental authority to discourage \"love marriages\".\n\nThe report of the Inquiry of the Commission for Women (1997) clearly stated that the Hudood legislation must be repealed as it discriminates against women and is in conflict with their fundamental rights. A similar commission during Benazir Bhutto's administration had also recommended amending certain aspects of Hudood Ordinance. However, neither Benazir Bhutto nor Nawaz Sharif implemented these recommendations.\n\nThe enhancement of women's status was stated as one of the 16 goals listed in the \"Pakistan 2010 Program\" (1997), a critical policy document. However, the document omits women while listing 21 major areas of interests. Similarly, another major policy document, the \"Human Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy\" (1999), mentioned women as a target group for poverty reduction but lacks gender framework.\n\nThe country's first all-women university, named after Fatima Jinnah, was inaugurated on 6 August 1998. It suffered from delays in the release of development funds from the Federal Government.\n\nIn 2000, the Church of Pakistan ordained its first women deacons. In 2002 (and later during court trials in 2005), the case of Mukhtaran Mai brought the plight of rape victims in Pakistan under an international spotlight. On 2 September 2004, the Ministry of Women Development was made an independent ministry, separating from the Social Welfare and Education Ministry.\n\nIn July 2006, General Pervez Musharraf asked his Government to begin work on amendments to the controversial 1979 Hudood Ordinance introduced under Zia-ul-Haq's régime. He asked the Law Ministry and the Council of Islamic Ideology (under the Ministry of Religious Affairs) to build a consensus for the amendments to the laws. On 7 July 2006 General Musharraf signed an ordinance for the immediate release on bail of around 1300 women who were currently languishing in jails on charges other than terrorism and murder.\n\nIn late 2006, the Pakistani parliament passed the Women's Protection Bill, repealing some of the Hudood Ordinances. The bill allowed for DNA and other scientific evidence to be used in prosecuting rape cases. The passing of the Bill and the consequent signing of it into law by President General Pervez Musharraf invoked protests from hard-line Islamist leaders and organisations. Some experts also stated that the reforms will be impossible to enforce.\n\nThe Cabinet has approved reservation of 10% quota for women in Central Superior Services in its meeting held on 12 July 2006. Earlier, there was a 5% quota for women across the board in all Government departments. In December 2006, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz approved the proposal by Ministry of Women Development, to extend this quota to 10%.\n\nIn 2006, The Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act was also passed. In December 2006, for the first time, women cadets from the Military Academy Kakul assumed guard duty at the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\n\nThe Women's Protection Bill, however, has been criticised by many including human rights and women's rights activists for only paying lip service and failing to repeal the Hudood Ordinances.\n\nComing into power it appointed a female member of parliament and party loyalist Dr. Fehmida Mirza as the first female speaker in South Asia. During the tenure Pakistan saw its first female foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, first secretary of defence, Nargis Sethi, deputy speaker of a province Shehla Raza and numerous female ministers, ambassadors, secretaries including Farahnaz Ispahani, Media Advisor to former President of Pakistan and co-chairman PPP, Sherry Rehman former ambassador of Pakistan to US, Fauzia Wahab, Firdous Ashiq Awan, Farzana Raja, Shazia Marri, Sharmila Faruqi and others held prestigious positions within the administration.\n\nOn 29 January 2010 the President signed the 'Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace Bill 2009' which the parliament adopted on 21 January 2010. Two additional bills were signed into law by the President in December 2012 criminalising the primitive practices of Vani, watta-satta, swara and marriage to the Quran which used women as tradable commodities for settlement of disputes. In addition the punishment for acid throwing to life imprisonment. The government further established special task force in the interior Sindh region to for action against the practice of Karo-Kari establishing helplines and offices in the districts of Sukkur, Jacobabad, Larkana and Khairpur.\n\nIn 2012 the government revived the National Commission on Status of Women established by General Musharraf for three years in 2000, later being revived for three years at a time. The bill moved by government established the commission as a permanent body with the task to ensure the implementation of women protection legislation and abuses against women.\n\nIn February 2012, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement held the world's largest women's political rally in Karachi, with an estimated 100,000 women in attendance.\n\nTraditional lives of south Asian women in general & Muslim women in Pakistan in Particular were restricted to \"Chulha\" Cawka \"Char Diwari\" i.e. Kitchen stove with four walls; with additional burden of chastity, modesty and family honor being governed by misogyny & patriarchy, where in various levels of social seclusion from mandating pallu to dupatta, Purdah to Burqua were imposed on women and free dignified access to public places usually denied to women.\n\nIn May 2015 one of influential \"Maulana Fazlur Rehman faced satirical comment claiming he links earth quakes in Pakistan on some of the women sporting Jeans.\" \"In April 2020 another Maulana Tariq Jamil,in a live talk over a virtual platform provided by Imran Khan, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, blamed the COVID-19 pandemic on women in Pakistan opting for dancing and wearing skimpy clothes .\"\n\nPurdah norms are followed in few communities of Pakistan. It is practised in various ways, depending on family tradition, region, class, and rural or urban residence. Purdah is most likely to be practised among the Pashtuns and the Muslim Rajputs. Now, many women in Pakistan don't practice Purdah, which is opposed by many religious scholars. Generally, women living in more developed areas like Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad are more liberal in terms of dressing than women living in less developed areas.\n\nAlthough the Child Marriages Restraint Act makes it illegal for girls under the age of 16 to be married, instances of child marriages are commonly found in rural areas. Vani is a child marriage custom followed in tribal areas and the Punjab province. The young girls are forcibly married off in order to resolve the feuds between different clans; the Vani can be avoided if the clan of the girl agrees to pay money, called Deet, to other clans. Swara, Pait likkhi and Addo Baddo are similar tribal and rural customs that often promote marriage of girls in their early teenage years. In one extreme case in 2012, a local Jirga in Aari village, Swat ordered that Roza Bibi, a girl of six, must be married off to settle a dispute between her family and the rival family. As of 2018, the trend of Vani is decreased very much, allowing more young girls to live their childhood freely.\n\nWatta satta is a tribal custom in which brides are traded between two clans. In order to marry off a son, one must also have a daughter to marry off in return. If there is no sister to exchange in return for a son's spouse, a cousin, or a distant relative can also do. Even though Islamic law requires that both partners explicitly consent to marriage, women are often forced into marriages arranged by their fathers or tribal leaders. Watta satta is most common in rural parts of northwest and west Pakistan, and its tribal regions.\n\nLike in other parts of South Asia, the custom of dowry is practised in Pakistan, and conflicts related to it often result in violence, even dowry deaths. At over 2000 dowry-related deaths per year, and annual rates exceeding 2.45 deaths per 100,000 women from dowry-related violence, Pakistan has the highest reported number of dowry death rates per 100,000 women in the world.\n\nIn 1999, at least 1000 women were murdered in Pakistan and 90% of women reported being subject to domestic violence. Law enforcement authorities routinely dismiss domestic violence as private disputes. With domestic violence cases, it is important to acknowledge that marital rape is not considered a crime. Most women do not report the abuse they experience because they want to avoid ruining their family's reputation, they are scared the abuse will worse, and they are afraid they would be separated from their husband and kids. For the women that do report abuse, they are often harassed by the police and their families; about 33% of women were a victim of physical abuse and did not make any reports. When it comes to marital abuse, pregnant women are even victims. In order to cope, some women enter religious communities or religious events to avoid being home and further altercations. Some ask for help from their friends and family, but most are reluctant to make formal complaints because they feel as if they would not be understood\n\nWomen who report rape or sexual assault by strangers are often disbelieved and treated with disrespect by abusive police, forensic doctors who focus on virginity status instead of injuries and skeptical judges. Police in Pakistan often refuse to record the complaint of women when an officer may have been involved. Pakistan's rape law allows marital, does not define statutory rape and in some cases women are not allowed to testify. Instances such as rape are not taken towards action because of Islamic beliefs. The words of rape victims are not taken with serious matter and fail to prove that the victim is telling the truth. In the year 2006, President Pervez Musharraf passed the Protection of Women Act. The purpose of it was for women to be provided with relief and to be able to have protection under the Hudood Ordinance and back into the prosecution under the Pakistani Criminal code. The act recognized rape under five circumstances, against [a woman's] will, without [a women's] consent, with [a woman's] consent, when the consent has been obtained by putting a women in fear or of hurt, with her consent, when the man knows that he is not married to her and that the consent is given because she believes that the man is another person to whom she is or believes herself to be married; or with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age. Because of the act, a person in Pakistan was punishable by either death or imprisoned up to 10 to 25 years. Although the act was passed, there were no significant effects in which investigations were done on rape victims. On April 17, 2002, a woman by the name Zafran Bibi, who was 26 at the time, was sentenced to death by stoning in Pakistan. Zafran Bibi stepped forward as a rape victim in Pakistan. Bibi was recast as guilty for having sexual intercourse outside of valid marriage and was sentenced to death because of this incident. Bibi stated that she was tortured and raped by her brother-in-law, Jamal Khan. Her husband was in jail when the incident occurred. Human rights groups saw that Zafran Bibi sentence was bizarre and the actions that were taken towards her case were not taken in the matter that it should have been. The pressure of the Human Rights group ultimately led the court to overturn her sentence.\n\nA majority of the victims of honour killings are women and the punishments meted out to the murderers are very lenient.\n\nThe practice of summary killing of a person suspected of an illicit liaison is known as \"karo kari\" in Sindh and Balochistan. In December 2004, the Government passed a bill that made \"karo kari\" punishable under the same penal provisions as murder. In 2016, Pakistan repealed the loophole which allowed the perpetrators of honour killings to avoid punishment by seeking forgiveness for the crime from another family member, and thus be legally pardoned. Many cases of honour killings have been reported against women who marry against their family's wishes, who seek divorce or who have been raped. In addition, women of lower classes are more prone to being victims of honor killings or rape.\n\nAcid attacks occur within the public sphere. Acid and kerosene are thrown at women, mostly in the direction of their faces, as a form of permanent punishment. Many women do not report these attacks out of fear of getting attacked again or to protect the groups of people committing the attacks. Hundreds of women are victims of these attacks and some die from their injuries. When these attacks are reported they are written off as mistakes or suicides at times. In order to help with these attacks, the Depilex Smileagain Foundation provides victims of acid attacks with the opportunity to undergo surgery to heal their faces with the help of experienced doctors, while receiving the medical services they need to recover.\n\nUnder the Qisas (eye-for-an-eye) law of Pakistan, the perpetrator could suffer the same fate as the victim, if the victim or the victim's guardian chooses. The perpetrator may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes. Section 336B of Pakistan Penal Code states: \"Whoever causes hurt by corrosive substance shall be punished with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description which shall not be less than fourteen years and a minimum fine of one million rupees.\" Additionally, section 299 defines \"Qisas\" and states: \"\"Qisas\" means punishment by causing similar hurt at the same part of the body of the convict as he has caused to the victim or by causing his death if he has committed qatl-iamd (intentional manslaughter) in exercise of the right of the victim or a Wali (the guardian of the victim).\"\n\nFounder of Aware Girls, Gulalai Ismail, was threatened with death by the Inter-Services Intelligence after she raised awareness of sexual assault committed by Pakistani security forces on women. The Pakistani military has tried to silence attempts to highlight sexual assault against women and planned to arrest Ismail, forcing her to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nThree different research studies, according to Klausen and Wink, note that Pakistan had the world's highest percentage of missing girls, relative to its total pre-adult female population.\n\nIn some parts of Sindh, the practice of marrying a woman to the Quran is prevalent among landlords; it requires that the woman live without a husband throughout her life. Although it is alien to Islam and has no religious basis, the practice is often used by men to keep and grab the land of their sisters and daughters.\n\nAccording to Prof Huma Arshad Cheema (HOD Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology of the Children’s Hospital, Lahore), 50 per cent of infant mortality in Pakistan is attributed to Inherited Metabolic Disorders besides inherited or genetic diseases affecting liver, heart, kidney and brain in children. As per Dr Areeba Farrukh, a Pediatric Resident at National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Karachi, cousin marriages are also an important reason for diseases like thalassemia and faulty haemoglobin build-up, which can eventually lead to iron deficiency and anemia.\n\nAccording to joint research study conducted in 2016-2017 by scholars of Department of Biological Science Gomal University, and Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering University of Agriculture Peshawar; high rate of consanguinity in Pakistan does contribute to hereditary hearing loss and to minimize such risks genetic counseling is required. Many girls groomed and pressured to accept cousin marriages to keep familial feudal properties and relations intact, in process kids do suffer various kind of genetic disabilities on account of traditions of cousin marriages. According to Sadia Saeed deformed 'A DCY3' mutations lead to slow learning and from mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, loss of sense of smell to gaining obesity with more likelihood of diabetes in here in life. 'MARK3' mutation may leads to progressive Phthisis bulbi (shrinkage of the eyeball). Mutation \"IQSEC1 can be a cause of intellectual disability, developmental delays, short stature, speech loss, low muscle tone and, in some cases, seizures and aggressive behavior.\"\n\nWhile some feminists contest the term, still the word Aurat is most used term for women in Pakistan.\n\nAlthough Pakistan's population is almost entirely Muslim (96.4% as of 2010), women's status differs significantly by community.\nWomen's dress varies depending on region, class and occasion, but shalwar kameez is the principal garment worn by Pakistani women. Ghararas (a loose divided skirt worn with a blouse) and lehengas were once common, but are now worn mostly at weddings.\n\nFew Pakistani women wear the hijab or burqa in public, and the degree to which they choose to cover varies; with the use of the burqa being primarily predominant in Pashtun territories. Some traditionally Afghan clothing styles have become prevalent in recent decades in some areas of Pakistan. \nPakistan has no laws banning or enforcing the hijab. Surveys conducted in Pakistan show that most women wearing the hijab do so of their own choice. The veil is not an absolute requirement, and women may even wear jeans and T-shirts in urban areas of Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and other big cities. In the last five years, western dressing has become much more common among women in cities. Many women wear pants, plazzo and tight jeans with long shirts as well as short shirts. Most women in small cities and rural areas wear the Shalwar Kameez, which consists of a tunic top and baggy trouser set which covers their arms, legs and body. A loose dupatta scarf is also worn around the shoulders, upper chest and head. Men also have a similar dress code, but only women are expected to wear a dupatta in public.\n\nSome Pakistani women who do not wear the hijab may wear the dupatta or chadar instead.\nA sari is a formal dress worn on special occasions by some, mainly urban, women. The Islamization under General Zia ul Haq's dictatorship branded the sari as an \"un-Islamic\" form of dress. but it has made a comeback in fashionable circles.\n\nIn Pakistan, the women's access to property, education, employment etc. remains considerably lower compared to men's. The social and cultural context of Pakistani society has historically been predominantly patriarchal. Women have a low percentage of participation in society outside of the family.\n\nDespite the improvement in Pakistan's literacy rate since its independence, the educational status of Pakistani women is among the lowest in the world. The literacy rate for urban women is more than five times the rate for rural women. The literacy rate is still lower for women compared to men: the literacy rate is 45.8% for females, while for males it is 69.5% (aged 15 or older, data from 2015).\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, the school drop-out rate among girls was very high (almost 50 percent), even though the educational achievements of female students were higher than male students at different levels of education. Since then, education for women has improved rapidly. In Lahore there are 46 public colleges out of which 26 are female colleges and some of the others are co-educational. Similarly the public universities of Pakistan have female enrollment than male.\n\nUNESCO and the Orascom subsidiary of Pakistan telco, Mobilink have been using mobile phones to educate women and improve their literacy skills since 4 July 2010. The local BUNYAD Foundation of Lahore and the UN's work via the Dakar Framework of Action for EFA are also helping with this issue.\nAs of 2010, the literacy rate of females in Pakistan was at 39.6 percent compared to that of males at 67.7 percent. More recent statistics provided by the UNICEF - shows that female education amongst 15-24 year olds has increased substantially to 61.5% - an increase of 45%. Male education is at a steady rate of 71.2%.\n\nThe objectives of education policies in Pakistan aim to achieve equality in education between girls and boys and to reduce the gender gap in the educational system. However, the policy also encourages girls, mainly in rural areas of Pakistan, to acquire basic home management skills, which are preferred over full-scale primary education. The attitudes towards women in Pakistani culture make the fight for educational equality more difficult. The lack of democracy and feudal practices of Pakistan also contribute to the gender gap in the educational system. \nGirls of rural areas are facing many problems regarding their studies. There are several issues and causes of education problems for girls in rural areas of Pakistan.\nInaccessibility of education in Pakistan, especially in backward areas is a result of distance, child labor, scarcity of teachers, local leaders, frequent policy changes and fear of losing power. In KPK and Balochistan women are severely bound by cultural constraints and prejudices. They are involved in reproductive and productive and community work for 14 to 18 hours. Women which are the 51% on the country population, have been forced to just bear children for their husband and remain within their houses. In Balochistan, female literacy rate stands between 15 and 25%.\nIn backward areas, girls schools are far away from their homes, many families cannot afford traveling expenses for their children. Separate schools for girls are not available. Girls live in fear due to extremist policy. In KPK militant groups have blasted thousands of schools because they are against women education, they have given threats to several governments and private girls school for stopping girls education.\n\nThis feudal system leaves the underpowered, women in particular, in a very vulnerable position. The long-lived socio-cultural belief that women play a reproductive role within the confines of the home leads to the belief that educating women holds no value. Although the government declared that all children of the ages 5–16 can go to school, there are 7.261 million children out of school at the primary level in Pakistan, and 58% are female (UNESCO, Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2011). Although girls have the right to get an education legally, in many rural regions of Pakistan girls are strongly discouraged from going to school and discriminated against, as there are violent acts such as acid throwing which many girls fall victim to for attending school.\n\nFemales are educated equally like Males in urban areas such as Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi. However, in rural areas, the education rate is substantially lower. This has begun to change with the issuance of government policy, in which 70% of new schools are built for girls, and also plans to increase the size of women's school so that the infrastructure matches those of men's schools and more female colleges have also been established in order to provide women with higher education.\n\nWomen in elite urban districts of Pakistan enjoy a far more privileged lifestyle than those living in rural tribal areas. Women in urbanized districts typically lead more elite lifestyles and have more opportunities for education. Rural and tribal areas of Pakistan have an increasingly high rate of poverty and alarmingly low literacy rates. In 2002 it was recorded that 81.5 percent of 15- to 19-year-old girls from high-income families had attended school while 22.3 percent of girls from low-income families had ever attended school.\n\nIn comparison, it was recorded that 96.6 percent of Pakistani boys ages 15–19 coming from high-income families had attended schooling while 66.1 percent of 15- to 19-year-old boys from low-income families had attended school. Girls living in rural areas are encouraged not to go to school because they are needed in the home to do work at a young age. In most rural villages, secondary schooling simply does not exist for girls, leaving them no choice but to prepare for marriage and do household tasks. These rural areas often have inadequate funding and schooling for girls is at the bottom of their priorities.\n\nPakistan is a largely rural society (almost two thirds of the population lives in rural areas) and women are rarely formally employed. This does not mean that women do not participate in the economy: quite on the contrary, women usually work on the farm of the household, practice subsistence agriculture, or otherwise work within the household economic unit. However, women are often prevented from advancing economically, due to social restrictions on women's movement and gender mixing, as well as due to low education.\n\nAlthough women play an active role in Pakistan's economy, their contribution has been grossly underreported in some censuses and surveys. Part of the understimation of women's economic role is that Pakistan, like many other countries, has a very large informal sector. The 1991–92 Labour Force Survey revealed that only about 16% of women aged 10 years and over were in the labour force. According to World Bank, in 2014, women made up 22.3% of the labour force in Pakistan.\n\nAccording to the 1999 report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, only two percent of Pakistani women participate in the formal sector of employment. However, the 1980 agricultural census stated that the women's participation rate in agriculture was 73%. The 1990–1991 Pakistan Integrated Household Survey indicated that the female labour force participation rate was 45% in rural areas and 17% the urban areas. Pakistani women play a major role in agricultural production, livestock raising and cottage industries.\n\nIn 2008, it was recorded that 21.8 percent of females were participating in the labor force in Pakistan while 82.7 percent of men were involved in labor. The rate of women in the labor force has an annual growth rate of 6.5 percent. Out of the 47 million employed peoples in Pakistan in 2008, only 9 million were women and of those 9 million, 70 percent worked in the agricultural sector. The income of Pakistani women in the labor force is generally lower than that of men, due in part to a lack of formal education. The low female literacy rate is a large obstacle in women taking part in the workforce.\n\nDue to the religious and cultural values in Pakistan, women who do try to enter the workforce are often pushed into the lower of the three employment structures. This structure level, unorganized services sector, has low pay, low job security and low productivity. In order to improve this situation, governmental organizations and political parties need to push for the entrance of women into the organized services sector. Conservative interpretations of Islam have not promoted women's rights in the workforce, since they value women as keepers of the family honor, support gender segregation, and institutionalization of gender disparities.\n\nFurthermore, women who do work are often paid less than minimum wage, because they are seen as lesser beings in comparison to men, and “their working conditions vis-à-vis females are often hazardous; having long working hours, no medical benefits, no job security, subjected to job discrimination, verbal abuse and sexual harassment and no support from male oriented labor unions”(An In-Depth Analysis of Women's Labor Force Participation in Pakistan).\n\nAlthough these religious and cultural barriers exist keeping women away from the workforce, studies have shown that women-only entrepreneurial training that allows participants to develop capital and competences, can break these down. Programs such as this can go a long way in an Islamic socio-cultural context to develop tolerance and understanding.\n\nAround 90% of the Pakistani households are headed by men and most female-headed households belong to the poor strata of the society\n\nWomen lack ownership of productive resources. Despite women's legal rights to own and inherit property from their families, in 2000 there were very few women who had access and control over these resources.\n\nIn Pakistan, Hindu and Christian girls in Pakistan are kidnapped,raped,forcibly converted to Islam and married to Muslim men. These girls are generally 12 to 18 years old. According to the Aurat Foundation,about 1,000 non-Muslim girls are forcibly converted to Islam in Pakistan every year.\n\nPakistan is a patriarchal society where men are the primary authority figures and women are subordinate. Gender is one of the organizing principles of Pakistani society. Patriarchal values embedded in local traditions, religion and culture predetermine the social value of gender. Islam heavily influences gender roles in particular. An artificial divide between production and reproduction, made by the ideology of sexual division of labor, has placed women in reproductive roles as mothers and wives in the private arena of home and men in a productive role as breadwinners in the public arena.\n\nPakistani women lack social value and status because of negation of their roles as producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male members of the family are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the public arena, while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in the public arena.\n\nThis situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships. However, the spread of patriarchy is not even. The nature and degree of women’s subordination vary across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide. Patriarchal structures are relatively stronger in the rural and tribal setting where local customs establish male authority and power over women's lives. On the other hand, women belonging to the upper and middle classes have increasingly greater access to education and employment opportunities and can assume greater control over their lives.\n\nAccording to Pakistani standards, 'good women' could be either educated or uneducated and are expected to be unselfish, calm, tolerant, empathetic, reliable, able to organize, compromise, coordinate and maintain hospitality within the house and in keeping good relationships. They are also expected to do household chores, care for her children, husband and in-laws and, when needed, provide the home with external income. Women are also expected to marry a man of their parent's choice, follow Islam's code of dress and sacrifice their own dreams.\n\nIn a study carried out by Gallup Pakistan, the Pakistani affiliate of Gallup International, majority of the Pakistanis believe that both males and females have different roles to play in the society. Although women’s role has broadened beyond being a housewife over time, many people still give priority to men in politics, education, employment, and related walks of life. When the respondents were asked to give their opinion on a number of statements about gender roles 63% of the respondents agreed with the statement that \"Boys’ education is more important than girls’\"; 37% disagreed with it. The percentage of people agreeing with this statement was higher among rurallites (67%) as compared to the urbanites (53%). However, more than 90% believe that female children should be educated, nearly half of them believing that, should opportunity be available, they should rise to college education and beyond.\n\nFifty five percent (55%) of the respondents believe that \"Both husband and wife should work\"; while 45% said it is wrong for both husband and the wife to work. More than 50% of men including those from rural areas agree that both husband and wife should work for a better living. When the respondents were asked whether \"Men are better politicians as compared to women or not\"; 67% agree men are better politicians while 33% think otherwise. More women agree with this statement as compared to men. In response to the following statement \"If jobs are in shortage should men be given priority for employment\"; 72% of the respondents believe they should be given priority while 28% disagree. Eighty three percent (83%) of the respondents think that \"To live a happy life women need children\"; while only 17% think they do not. A vast majority of all respondents including 82% of women respondents believe that \"prosperous women should raise their voice to support the rights of poor women.\"\n\nThe average age of women for marriage increased from 16.9 years in 1951 to 22.5 years in 2005. A majority of women are married to their close relatives, i.e., first and second cousins. Only 37 percent of married women are not related to their spouses before marriage. A study published in 2000 recorded that the divorce rate in Pakistan was extremely low due to the social stigma attached to it.\n\nMany girls are still married off into a child marriage, and many complications with this can occur as childbirth from a child can cause complications with the baby and mother. A common system in place with marriage is the Dowry system in which a low or no status is assigned to a girl right from the prenatal stage.There are issues around the dowry system such as dowry related violence, in which the wife is abused by her husband. Before the marriage, the groom will make heavy financial demands on the bride's family as a condition of marrying their daughter.\n\nIn order for many parents' daughters to get married, they start \"obtaining loans from people, getting interest based loans from banks, utilising their life savings and even sell their homes\" (JAHEZ (Dowry Conditions Set by the Groom for Marriage)). Within the dowry system, abuse is likely to occur after the marriage has taken place. Prior to the marriage, if certain conditions that the groom and his family have put in place are not met, they will threaten to break off the marriage, which would be devastating for the bride and her family because of the lengths the bride's family already had to go through to pay her dowry and because traditionally it is a great dishonor to the family.\n\nAccording to 1998 figures, the female infant mortality rate was higher than that of male children. The maternal mortality rate was also high, as only 20 percent of women were assisted by a trained provider during delivery. Only 9 percent of women used contraceptives in 1985, but by 2000 this figure had increased substantially, and as of 2012/13, the contraceptive prevalence rate was 35.4%. The total fertility rate is 2.75 children born/woman (2015 est.).\n\nPakistan has taken certain initiatives in the health sector to redress gender imbalances. The SAP was launched in 1992–1993 to accelerate improvement in the social indicators. Closing the gender gap is the foremost objective of the SAP. The other major initiative is the Prime Minister's program of lady health workers (LHWs). Under this community-based program, 26,584 LHWs in rural areas and 11,967 LHWs in urban areas have been recruited to provide basic health care including family planning to women at the grassroots level. Other initiatives include the village-based family planning workers and extended immunisation programs, nutritional and child survival, cancer treatment, and increased involvement of media in health education.\n\nWomen in Pakistan have progressed in various fields of life such as politics, education, economy, services, health and many more.\n\nIn 2000, women's presence in political parties as well as in the political structure at the local, provincial, and national levels was insignificant due to cultural and structural barriers. The situation gradually improved, and by 2014, 20.7% of elected representatives were female, a statistic well ahead of the United States and less than 2% behind the United Kingdom.\n\nMiss Fatima Jinnah, sister of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, was an instrumental figure in the Pakistan movement. In 1947, she formed the Women's Relief Committee, which later formed the nucleus for the All Pakistan Women's Association (APWA).

The first Aurat March was held in Pakistan on 8 March 2018 (in the city of Karachi). In 2019, it was organised in Lahore and Karachi by a women's collective called \"Hum Auratein\" (We the Women), and in other parts of the country, including Islamabad, Hyderabad, Quetta, Mardan, and Faislabad, by Women democratic front (WDF), Women Action Forum (WAF), and others. The march was endorsed by the Lady Health Workers Association, and included representatives from multiple women's-rights organizations. The march called for more accountability for violence against women, and to support for women who experience violence and harassment at the hands of security forces, in public spaces, at home, and at the workplace. Reports suggest that more and more women rushed to join the march until the crowd was became scattered. Women (as well as men) carried posters bearing phrases such as ‘Ghar ka Kaam, Sab ka Kaam’, and ‘Women are humans, not honour’ became a rallying cry.\n\nPakistani civil society and Pakistani feminists have produced a significant number of big and small, courageous NGOs and proactive activism including that of Me Too Movement and annual Aurat March which work towards improve Pakistani women's global situation and particularly to prevent violence against women, for instance:\n\n\n\n\nSportswomen of Pakistan have always been plagued by the patriarchal society and many have come forward to claim that coaches, selectors and others who are in position of power demand sexual favours. Sexual abuse of this kind has led some athletes to commit suicide due to inaction of authorities in pursuing the suspects. In some cases the female athletes who register the cases of sexual abuse and harassment are banned or put on probation.\n\nIn 1996, when sisters Shaiza and Sharmeen Khan first tried to introduce women's cricket in Pakistan, they were met with court cases and even death threats. The government refused them permission to play India in 1997, and ruled that women were forbidden from playing sports in public. However, later they were granted permission, and the Pakistani women's cricket team played its first recorded match on 28 January 1997 against New Zealand in Christchurch.\n\nShazia Hidayat was the only female athlete on the Pakistan team competing at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, becoming the second woman to ever represent Pakistan in an Olympic event.\n\nSidra Sadaf, a woman cyclist won a silver medal at the 11th South Asian Games in Dhaka, Bangladesh in January 2010.

{"id": "1939303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939303", "title": "Rosemarie Arenas", "text": "Rosemarie Arenas\n\nRose Marie \"Baby\" Arenas is a Manila society figure who featured prominently in the political scene of the Philippines in the 1990s. She was a relatively unknown socialite until 1993, when the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" reported that she had a past intimate relationship with the then-Philippine President Fidel V. Ramos. The scandal grew when within days after the revelation, the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission ruled against the owners of the Philippine Daily Inquirer in a dispute involving one-third of the stock ownership of the newspaper. It was widely reported that the adverse ruling came about due to presidential displeasure over the report, although no concrete proof of such ever emerged.\n\nPresident Fidel Ramos never publicly acknowledged a past relationship with Ms. Arenas, although neither did he emphatically deny the report. The scandal, though widely reported at that time, had no visible impact on the Ramos presidency, and quickly passed. For her part, Ms. Arenas attempted to parlay her unexpected fame into electoral victory, running for the Philippine Senate in 1995 and for the House of Representatives in 1998.\n\nMs. Arenas is also known for her considerable philanthropic efforts and support for the arts. She famously convinced the legendary Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti to perform in Manila for the first time.\n\nArenas' daughter, Rachel, was the incumbent representative of Pangasinan's third district. She was set to run unopposed in the 2013 elections but gave way to her mother.\n\nShe is currently serving as Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines.\n\nArenas was born Rose Marie Bosch Jimenez in 1938 in Malasiqui, Pangasinan. Her parents were Alfredo Jimenez, an accountant at the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and a member of a modestly rich family from Makati; and Remedios Bosch, an opera singer and a music professor at the University of the East (UE). Her father was known as the disciplinarian in the family while her mother influenced her love for charity work, culture, and the performing arts. Due in part to her well-connected mother who sang in the prestigious opera galas in Manila and abroad, Arenas was exposed early to Manila's high society.\n\nHer strict upbringing resulted in an almost planned life during her formative years. She took up piano and voice lessons when she was a child; an obvious consequence of her mother's profession and passion. In college, her father insisted that she take up accountancy at the University of Santo Tomas (UST); again, following the footsteps of her father. Throughout her student years, she was not allowed to go out with friends, to have a boyfriend, or to enjoy life the way other teenagers of her time did. She led a life that had a very definite pattern – home-school-home.\n\nDiscipline was so stern in the young life of Arenas that it was almost ironic that she was allowed by her parents to become a professional model. For three years during the 1960s, she modelled for some of the leading stores and designers in the Philippines. She was even allowed to join the Miss Philippines pageant– convincing her parents that the proceeds of the event would go to charity – and even became a finalist in the event.\n\nThe choice of her husband was also the result of parental influence in her personal life. After graduating from college, her parents arranged her wedding to Ramon Arenas, a businessman engaged in the shipping industry. Ramon's mother is the very wealthy Doña Julieta Hofileña Lopez, sister to industrialist Don Eugenio Hofileña Lopez (ex-owner of Meralco, Negros Navigation, ABS-CBN) and former Vice President Fernando Lopez (owner of the University of Iloilo). The Lopezes of Iloilo were one of the wealthiest clans in the Philippines. Although an adopted child, Doña Julieta was the only recognized daughter of Doña Presentacion Hofileña and as such was an equal beneficiary of all the Lopez assets and haciendas when Doña Presentacion and her husband died. As the favorite daughter-in-law of Doña Julieta who inherited much of her own heirloom jewelry, this may explain why Arenas is one of the very few females outside of the tightly-knit Lopez clan to own such select Philippine jewel sets.\n\nAlthough Baby and Ramon had five children, the two eventually separated and she never married again.\n\nArenas is an effective businesswoman. Although she was a Blue Lady of Imelda Marcos, much of her wealth came before her association with the Philippine first lady. From her husband Ramon she received numerous houses in Forbes Park and Dasmariñas Village on top of priceless jewelry and personal effects from her mother-in-law. After 1986 and essentially on her own, Arenas dabbled into supplying the Philippine Military with footwear and other essentials, adding more to her family's assets on her own stewardship.\n"}

The other controversy was created by a photo of one of the tanks which was named \"The New Testament.\" This was used by some parties including Michael Moore to claim that the US was religiously motivated and was conducting a crusade while in Iraq.

{"id": "1939324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939324", "title": "Westminster Dragoons", "text": "Westminster Dragoons\n\nThe Westminster Dragoons (WDs) is central London’s only Army Reserve cavalry subunit. One of the Royal Yeomanry's six squadrons, the squadron's current role is light cavalry: to provide a rapidly deployable force with fast mobility and substantial firepower in support of operations. Formed in the aftermath of Second Boer War as part of the County of London Yeomanry, the WDs fought in the Battle of Gallipoli and led British forces onto the beaches during the Normandy Invasion in 1944. The squadron most recently saw action on Operation Telic, when it was mobilised for the 2003 war in Iraq and again in 2006 for peace support operations there. Soldiers and officers of the squadron have also deployed as individual replacements on Operation Herrick in Afghanistan and on Operation Cabrit in Poland.\n\nThe regiment was first recruited from wealthy merchants and bankers as the London and Westminster Light Horse in 1779. It was disbanded in 1783 but in 1793 the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, proposed that the English Counties form a force of Volunteer Yeoman Cavalry that could be called on by the King to defend the country against invasion or by the Lord Lieutenant to subdue any civil disorder within the country. So the regiment was reformed again the following year. The regiment was renamed the Westminster Volunteer Cavalry in 1797. and barracks were built to accommodate the regiment in Gray's Inn Road in 1812. The regiment was disbanded again in 1829 and the barracks were decommissioned in 1830.\n\nFollowing a string of defeats during Black Week in early December 1899, the British government realised that it would need more troops than just the Regular Army to fight the Second Boer War. On 13 December, the decision to allow volunteer forces to serve in South Africa was made, and a Royal Warrant was issued on 24 December. This officially created the Imperial Yeomanry (IY). The force was organised as county service companies of approximately 115 men signed up for one year, and volunteers from the Yeomanry Cavalry and civilians (usually middle and upper class) quickly filled the new force, which was equipped to operate as Mounted infantry (see dragoon). Second and third contingents were sent out in the following years.\n\nOne such unit was the 24th (Metropolitan Mounted Rifles) Battalion, consisting of 94th, 95th, 96th and 97th (Metropolitan Mounted Rifles) Companies raised in London for the second contingent on 30 March 1901.\n\nIn 1901, 16 new IY regiments raised from veterans of the first IY contingent returning from South Africa were added to the existing Yeomanry Cavalry. The 2nd County of London Imperial Yeomanry was formed on 24 August 1901 with four squadrons and a machine gun section, perpetuating the 24th (Metropolitan Mounted Rifles) Battalion. Over 800 members of the regiment served in South Africa, and the regiment was awarded the Battle Honour South Africa 1902. On 2 August 1902 Westminster Council granted permission for the regiment to adopt the subtitle '(Westminster Dragoons)' (to perpetuate the 1779-1829 units) and to use the city's coat-of-arms as its cap badge.\n\nFrom the start it was smart regiment filled with wealthy gentlemen from the City and the West End. Their attitude and attire was such that, as they strutted across West London, members became known as the 'Piccadilly Peacocks'. Several of the unit's first officers were former officers of the 1st The Royal Dragoons, forerunners of the Blues and Royals; one of the first troop leaders was Raj Rajendra Narayan, Maharaj Kumar (Prince) of Cooch Behar. They brought with them the Royals' pre-Waterloo cap badge, which was later adopted by Colonels and Brigadiers of the staff, which is why, until a common Royal Yeomanry capbadge was adopted in 2006, young WD officers often found themselves amused at being saluted by officers of higher rank. The WD stable belt (worn in barracks) bears the Royal racing colours – the imperial hues of purple, gold and scarlet as a result of the personal friendship of its first commanding officer, Colonel Charles Rosedew Burn, with King Edward VII, whose Aide-de-camp Burn had been when he was Prince of Wales.\nAs an urban regiment, the yeomen were unable to supply their own horses, so the senior Westminster officers made use of their links to the highest ranks of Society to borrow mounts from the Household Cavalry for summer training camps. Later horses were hired. Even at this time, the WDs were at the forefront of using new equipment, being the second unit in the British army after the Westmorland and Cumberland Yeomanry to be equipped with mobile wireless. In 1910, Lord Howard de Walden presented two Marconi pack sets to the regiment.\n\nIn 1907 the regimental headquarters (RHQ) was at 102 Victoria Street, but by 1914 it had moved to 1 Elverton Street, Westminster.\n\nWhen the IY were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the regiment simply dropped 'Imperial' from its title. It was attached to the London Mounted Brigade for training, but was otherwise under the command of London District.\n\nThe Westminster Dragoons' summer camp in 1914 was at Goring-on-Thames. It began on 25 July, but the regiment was recalled to Westminster when mobilisation orders arrived on 5 August. The regiment reorganised on the three-squadron basis used by the Regular cavalry and purchased horses.\n\nIn accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (\"7 Edw. 7, c.9\"), which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.\n\nThe regiment sailed on 10 September for Egypt, thereby being one of the first Yeomanry regiments to go overseas on active service. It arrived at Alexandria on 25 September and went to relieve the 3rd Dragoon Guards as the Cairo Garrison cavalry regiment. On 19 January 1915, it joined the 1/1st Hertfordshire Yeomanry to form the Yeomanry Mounted Brigade. The regiment carried out security and escort duties in Cairo and patrols on the fringe of the Sinai Desert to protect the Suez Canal.\n\nThe brigade joined the 2nd Mounted Division on 13 August and was redesignated as the 5th (Yeomanry) Mounted Brigade. It was dismounted to take part in the Gallipoli Campaign, leaving a squadron HQ and two troops (about 100 officers and men) in Egypt to look after the horses.\n\nThe regiment sailed from Alexandria on 14 August, arriving at Mudros on 17 August. It landed at \"A\" Beach, Suvla Bay the following day and moved into reserve positions at Lala Baba on the night of 20 August. On 21 August, it advanced to Chocolate Hill and was in reserve for the attacks on Scimitar Hill and Hill 112. Due to losses during the Battle of Scimitar Hill and wastage during August 1915, the 2nd Mounted Division had to be reorganised. On 4 September 1915, the 1st Composite Mounted Brigade was formed from 1st (1st South Midland), 2nd (2nd South Midland) and 5th (Yeomanry) Mounted Brigades. Each dismounted brigade formed a battalion sized unit, hence the regiment was amalgamated with the Hertfordshire Yeomanry to form 5th Yeomanry Regiment.\n\n5th Yeomanry Regiment left Suvla on 31 October 1915 for Mudros. It left Mudros on 27 November, arrived at Alexandria on 1 December and went to Mena Camp, Cairo. The brigade left the 2nd Mounted Division on 7 December, was reformed and remounted, and joined the Western Frontier Force. The Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was broken up by March 1916, and the regiment was attached to the 6th Mounted Brigade, still in the Western Frontier Force.\nThe regiment was split up at the beginning of 1917:\n\nThe Westminster Dragoons now joined the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) for the Sinai and Palestine campaign. In August 1917, the regiment was concentrated and formed XX Corps Cavalry Regiment. The WDs were involved in fierce fighting, both mounted and dismounted. Early on 31 October the regiment took part in the attack on Beersheba. In the first phase it held a position on the right flank of XX Corps under shrapnel and machine gun fire. A and B Squadrons fired intermittent bursts of rifle and Hotchkiss machine gun fire, but expected a counter-attack. The infantry attacked at 12.15 in the second phase, and the Turks began retiring from their central position. At 14.00 the WD moved out in mounted pursuit but were held up after about a mile by heavy shrapnel and machine gun fire. At 16.30 the enemy retired. The WD's casualties amounted to one other rank (OR) and two horses killed, one officer, 16 ORs and several horses wounded; the engagement resulted in awards of one Military Cross (MC) and three Military Medal (MM) to members of the regiment.\n\nAfter the fall of Beersheba, the regiment was briefly split with C Sqn covering the advance of 53rd (Welsh) Division and A & B Sqns attached to the Australian Mounted Division operating between Beersheba and Gaza. It came back under XX Corps in November. A Squadron was the first formed body of troops to enter Jerusalem after the city had been surrendered to two sergeants of 2/19th Battalion, London Regiment, and the regiment bears the liberation of that city as a battle honour.\n\nAll squadrons were then withdrawn for security duties at Bethlehem, then operated on the right flank of the army, where on 27 December C Sqn repulsed a serious attempt by the Turks from Deir Ibn Obeid to recapture Jerusalem.\n\nWhen the EEF resumed its advance in March 1918, the WD advanced 10 miles beyond Jerusalem, but the German Spring Offensive led to an urgent call for troops to be sent from the EEF to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and nine Yeomanry regiments were hurriedly converted to the machine gun role.\n\nIn April 1918, the regiment left XX Corps and was reformed as F Battalion, Machine Gun Corps. F Battalion, MGC was posted to France, arriving on 1 June 1918. On 19 August 1918 it was renumbered as 104th (Westminster Dragoons) Battalion, Machine Gun Corps. It remained on the Western Front for the rest of the war. At the Armistice, it was serving as Army Troops with the Second Army.\n\nThe 2nd Line regiment was formed at Westminster in August 1914. Early in 1915, it went to Feltham and in the summer to Harlow. There are three versions of its subsequent history:\nThere are no battle honours to support overseas service in France. It appears that the unit was absorbed into the Tank Corps.\n\nThe 3rd Line regiment was formed in 1915 and in the summer was affiliated to a Reserve Cavalry Regiment in Eastern Command. In 1916, it was with the 9th Reserve Cavalry Regiment at The Curragh and in early 1917 it was absorbed into the 4th Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Aldershot.\n\nAfter World War I the WDs once again embraced new technology, making the decision to become an armoured car unit at a time when many yeomanry units were determined to remain mounted. The decision to accept immediate conversion was that of its then commanding officer, Lord Howard de Walden. On 11 March 1920, the regiment reformed with the title 4th Armoured Car Company (Westminster Dragoons), but this was quickly changed to 22nd (London) Armoured Car Company (Westminster Dragoons), Tank Corps in the retitled Territorial Army (TA), thus forming its link with the Tank Corps (Royal Tank Corps from 18 October 1923, and Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) from 11 April 1939).\n\nThe armoured car company was expanded to a full battalion (22nd (Westminster Dragoons) Battalion, RTR) in January 1938.\n\nOn mobilisation at the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the Westminster Dragoons became an Officer Cadet Training Unit, with over 90 per cent of pre-war Westminster Dragoons gaining their commissions and transferring into units throughout the British Army before the Regiment reverted to an armoured role in 1940. Among them was Captain Philip John Gardner VC MC, who had joined as a trooper before the war, commissioned and then transferred to the RTR, going on to win the Victoria Cross for saving the life of a badly wounded officer of the King's Dragoon Guards whose armoured car was out of action and under heavy fire.\n\nThe regiment regained its combat status in 11 November 1940, when it became 2nd County of London Yeomanry (Westminster Dragoons) in the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) – always known as simply the Westminster Dragoons. The regiment joined the newly-formed 30th Armoured Brigade in 11th Armoured Division on 8 March 1941. In May 1942 the brigade transferred to 42nd Armoured Division, and then in October 1943 to 79th Armoured Division under Major-General Percy Hobart. This division was equipping with specialist armour ('Hobart's Funnies') for the planned Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord), and 30th Armoured became the Flail tank brigade of the division.\n\nThe Germans planted over four million mines along the French coast to hinder the Allied landings in 1944. To break through these defences at the start of the Normandy Invasion, the British produced a number of novel armoured fighting vehicles under Hobart's ingenious direction, including the Sherman Crab. The Crab bore a rotating drum with dozens of chains attached; these detonated mines in its path to produce a beaten passage through the thickest of minefields.\n\nOn 1 January 1944, then under the command of Lt-Col W.Y.K. Blair-Oliphant, the regiment moved to Thorpeness in Suffolk to begin flail training, though no flail tanks had yet arrived. In the meantime it received a draft of men who had experience with the Scorpion flail, and some tanks equipped with anti-mine rollers. By February the regiment had a mixed roster of tanks for training: 19 Sherman V, 17 Centaur 1, 4 Cromwell, 6 Valentine II Scorpions, but only 3 of the Sherman Crabs that they would take into action. The slow, unsafe Scorpions were too unlike the Crab to be much use for training. The regiment practised driving on and off a concrete mock-up of a tank landing craft (LCT), the entrance of which was only wider than the rotor of the Crab. It also practised indirect gunfire techniques controlled by a Forward Observation Officer (FOO).\n\nIn March the regiment received its orders to mobilise, and training intensified. The last major exercise ('Fabius') was held in early May, but there were still too few Crabs: the regiment collected more Sherman V 'Quick Fix' gun tanks that could be fitted as 'pilot' roller tanks, but in the event these were used as command tanks. Later in the month the regiment concentrated in camp at Stanswood in Hampshire, ready to embark for Normandy with 56 Crabs, 26 Shermans, 3 Armoured recovery vehicles (ARVs) and 13 Scout cars; it still had 6 Scorpions on charge, but these were left behind, as were the 'Rollers'.\n\nFor the assault landings the Westminster Dragoons were under the command of 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division on Gold Beach, with A Squadron detached under the command of 22nd Dragoons to work with 3rd Canadian Division on Juno Beach and 3rd British Division on Sword Beach. The Crabs were to form composite breaching teams with Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) fitted with a variety of devices to make lanes through the enemy's beach defences. These teams had trained together at Stanswood and on the morning of 6 June, D Day, they were deployed as follows:\n\nThe LCTs were supposed to be preceded by Sherman DD 'swimming' tanks, but in Gold sector the surf was too bad and they were not launched, so the breaching teams were the first vehicles ashore at H-Hour (07.25). They then got to work. For example, Lt Pear leading two Crabs with No 1 Breaching Team of X Breaching Sqn drove off the LCT and waded to the beach, where his rear tank got bogged in clay. Pear flailed a lane across the beach up to the lateral road and turned left as planned. His role now was to remain in reserve, giving covering fire. However, the team at No 3 Lane had failed, and Pear was ordered to carry on inland. He crossed a stream and an anti-tank ditch, finding to his surprise that the bridges had not been blown by the enemy. He was then stopped by a large crater (probably from a British shell or bomb), but this was quickly bridged by an AVRE and Pear continued to flail a lane up the hill so that the DD tanks go move inland. No 2 Team was held up beyond the lateral road by boggy ground and craters, despite making a 'sporting effort to get past'. Both Crabs of No 3 Team got to the beach but were hit in the rotor by a German 88 mm gun on the sea wall at La Rivière. The squadron commander ordered the AVRE bridgelayer to reverse and go to help No 2 Team.\n\nIn Z Bridging Sqn, Captain Roger Bell, leading No 6 Breaching Team, suffered a burnt-out starter motor, had to be towed off the LCT by an AVRE and was late on the beach. He saw an AVRE hit by the troublesome '88' at La Rivière, so he moved to a position where he could engage it, and destroyed the gun. Bell then began flailing a lane across the beach, but got bogged just as he crossed the lateral road. Corporal Thorpe took over, but had a track blown off by a mine. Bell's Crab was then towed out by an AVRE that dropped its Fascine into the bog by the road, and Bell proceeded up the road. The Crabs of Nos 4 and 5 Breaching Teams got bogged before they reached the road, but No 5 Team gave covering fire with High explosive shell and smoke shell to No 6 Team and the infantry attacking La Rivière.\n\nB Squadron Westminster Dragoons had similar experiences. The breaching team for Lane 1 could not be landed because the LCT was hit on the run in, and the team for Lane 2 was landed at Lane 3. Lieutenant Townsend-Green's Crab flailed for before it got bogged, so he took over Cpl Barton's Crab and took a different route towards the vital ramp near La Hamel. However, he was then bogged and the Crab hit three times by a German field gun at La Hamel. The Lane 3 team was more or less in the right place and Serjeant Lindsay flailed a path onto the mainland. He then turned to support the attack by 1st Battalion Hampshire Regiment on La Hamel but the Crab was destroyed by anti-tank fire in the town. Although wounded, Lindsay evacuated his crew. Captain Taylor in the second flail cleared a lane before his Crab was destroyed by a double mine, but the lane provided a clear exit. The team in Lane 4 was completely bogged, but Lanes 5 and 6 were successfully cleared within 15–22 minutes of landing, despite the breach commander's Crab being hit by shellfire on the landing craft ramp and burning out. Major Stanyon therefore took to his feet to direct the mass of Crabs, AVREs and DD tanks, despite heavy machine gun fire: he was awarded a Military Cross (MC). The Lane 5 team then flailed paths through the inland minefield for the infantry, self-propelled (SP) artillery and anti-aircraft gunners.\n\nThe landings on Juno beach began at 07.50, those at Sword at 07.25. Both were successful, and the Crabs flailed routes through the minefields. Once Sword was secure, the remaining 2 and 4 Trps of A Sqn were landed there at H + 3 hours to work with A Sqn 22nd Dragoons and 629 Assault Sqn, RE, to help in a thrust towards Caen (they were a late addition to the plan, and had not practised landing from LCTs). The mobile battlegroup was to consist of the tanks of the Staffordshire Yeomanry carrying infantry of 2nd Battalion King's Shropshire Light Infantry, supported by SP guns of 7th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery. Congestion on the beach was so bad that the Staffordshire Yeomanry only linked up at 13.00; the RE squadron was ineffective after heavy casualties in the landing and B Trp 22nd Dragoons had just two flails left to join the WDs in preparing the route. The infantry had been ready since 11.00 and set off on foot at 12.30, leaving the armour and their heavy weapons to catch up. The armoured column made slow progress, restricted to a single road by bad going on one side and a deep minefield on the other. It overtook the infantry at the Périers-sur-le-Dan ridge and reached Beuville by 14.30, but the flails had to wait while the mobile column fought off a large-scale counter-attack by 21st Panzer Division from Caen. Four WD Crabs were knocked out in this engagement, which stopped 3rd British Division from achieving its ambitious objective of taking Caen that day.\n\nLt-Col Blair-Oliphant had landed an hour after H-Hour (aboard C Sqn's ARV, because his command tank was not due to arrive until later). By the time the regiment 'harboured' that night, B Sqn's ARV and C Sqn's M14 half-track had landed with four ammunition and petrol lorries. C Squadron harboured at Crépon with 11 Crabs (seven of them recovered from the beach). At 05.45 next morning (D+1, 7 June) they moved cautiously forward to a hedgerow but came under heavy fire, suffering several casualties among the dismounted crews. The squadron leader spotted an enemy field gun at a range of just and jumped onto Lt Hoban's tank to direct fire: one shot was enough to knock out the German gun. The squadron moved back and attended to its casualties. A composite force was then formed to deal with the Germans, consisting of Hoban's I Trp, two Churchill Crocodiles of 141st Regiment, RAC, and a few men of the Royal Artillery and Royal Signals to act as infantry. The Crocodiles 'flamed' a pillbox, the Crabs engaged dugouts with HE and machine gun fire, and 100 Germans surrendered with five guns. The Crabs were used later that day to round up prisoners of war round Crépon. By D+2 (8 June), B and C Sqns were at Saint-Gabriel-Brécy, with nine fit Crabs: seven were damaged beyond repair and 10 were repairable.\n\nOn D+2 four of A Sqn's Crabs assisted 3rd British Division at Lion-sur-Mer, clearing lanes through mines and barbed wire and engaging strongpoints with their main guns and machine guns. The following day A Sqn and a troop of AVREs helped 1st East Riding Yeomanry and 2nd Bn Royal Ulster Rifles in an attempt to advance beyond Périers. They had of open country to cross under shell, mortar and machine gun fire, the 2nd Bn RUR losing almost 200 men and the 1st EYR four tanks. The Crabs performed well in the unaccustomed role of infantry tanks, but all the AVREs were knocked out.\n\nThe Westminster Dragoons continued to serve as part of 79th Armoured Division throughout the campaign in Normandy and North West Europe, usually detached to assist other formations of 21st Army Group as required.\n\nFor example, during Operation Constellation to capture Overloon and Venray, the Crabs of A and C Sqns deployed with the AVREs 617 Assault Sqn, RE, to support 3rd British Division and 6th Guards Tank Brigade. At noon on 12 October 4th (Tank) Bn Coldstream Guards advanced to Overloon, where it encountered a minefield and A Sqn was ordered up to flail a path. One Crab (Lt Sutton) was disabled by a mine, and Sjt Harmston flailed a diversion round the wreck; other Crabs flailed two other lanes, and the Guards' Churchills advanced to take the town. Next day the Crabs continued flailing in front of the Coldstreamers, without finding any mines, but Lt Hall's tank engaged an enemy Panther tank. On 14 October the Crabs flailed a path where RE mine-lifting parties had previously come under fire, but the advance was halted by a Tiger I that 'brewed up' seven Coldstream Churchills before starting on Lt Cooper's partly Hull-down Crab, which was subjected to a hail of fire. Inexplicably, the Tiger withdrew before destroying the Crab. 15 October was spent on maintenance, then on 16 October the squadron advanced again, in pouring rain, mud and a flooded brook (the Molen Beek). Although four crossings were attempted on 3rd Division's front, only Lance-Sjt Carter was successful, his Crab covered by smoke fired by the rest of his troop. The Churchills followed over what for the next 24 hours was the only crossing. On 17 October the Crabs were at work again, losing two to mines, and rapidly wearing out their flail chains when repeatedly requested to flail along roads. (6th Guards Tank Bde noted that the concentrations of minefields in Operation Constellation were the heaviest they had yet encountered, including a new mine powerful enough to disable their heavy Churchill tanks.) By 18 October the squadron was down to five serviceable tanks, but Cooper and Carter pushed on into Venray, flailing the town's main street and piles of rubble ahead of the Guards' Churchills.\n\nMeanwhile, C Sqn had been operating with 4th (Tank) Bn Grenadier Guards since 12 October. Fifteen minutes before H-hour a minefield was discovered just short of the start line, and the Crabs had to deal with this despite badly broken ground. That attack went in successfully. Next day Lt Pear's 3 Trp had to flail a path followed by another of so the Grenadiers could reach their objective, followed by another of almost in the afternoon. On 16 October the squadron got badly bogged in full view of the enemy while trying to cross the Molen Beek and the attempt had to be abandoned. Next day a composite troop, comprising the fittest tanks and least tired crews was sent to help 29th Armoured Brigade, losing some tanks but carrying on and engaging anti-tank guns and capturing prisoners. The rest of C Sqn (three Crabs under Capt Bell, Lt Pear and Sjt Birch) helped 1st Bn Herefordshire Regiment in an attack north-east of Deurne on 17 October, under heavy fire. On 20 October A and C Sqns were pulled out to rejoin the regiment, receiving many compliments for their work.\n\nB Squadron had been operating miles away with 7th Armoured Division and 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division against 's-Hertogenbosch. 1 Troop operated so closely with A Sqn 1st Royal Tank Regiment that it was dubbed '5th Trp, A Sqn'. Small actions continued through early November. Lieutenant Michael Sutton won an MC on 2 November when he was supporting 23rd Hussars with two flails. A Hussars tanks was blown up on a mine, but the heavy fire prevented the crew from bailing out or sappers from clearing a path to it. Sutton flailed a path up to and round the disabled tank, then carried on flailing the road until an anti-tank gun disabled two Hussars' tanks and shot off his flail gear. Ordered to withdraw he had to do so slowly in reverse. While doing so he spotted a wounded man in a ditch: calling for smoke he got out of his tank and ran to bring the wounded man back to the tank, where another crew member dismounted to help get him aboard, all under heavy machine gun fire. Lieutenant Brian Pear was killed the following day while supporting 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division in an attack on Meijel: when Sjt Birch's Crab was hit and the crew unable to bale out he placed his tank between them and the enemy. Both Crabs were destroyed by anti-tank fire and only one man survived to be taken prisoner. The volume of fire was so great that 15th (Scottish) postponed all operations for 48 hours. C Squadron then flailed a path for 6th Guards Tank Bde, though 23 Churchills and one Crab were lost in an hour.\n\nThe Westminster Dragoons were once more with 15th (Scottish) Division for the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder) in March 1945, but were not called forward until bridges had been built. The regiment was surprised to learn from BBC radio reports that they had crossed a day before they actually did so. Once across the river barrier the campaign moved swiftly, with fewer prepared defensive positions to overcome, so there was little call for flail tanks. In early April RHQ and A Sqn were assigned to VIII Corps' Reserve, B Sqn to 1st Assault Bde in 21st Army Group Reserve, and C Sqn to 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division. By now the Crabs were being used as normal gun tanks: on 15 April C Sqn provided armoured support to 3rd Division at Wildeshausen, where they repelled a number of enemy counter-attacks as well as carrying out a minor offensive operation of their own.\n\nThe Westminster Dragoons' war ended with the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath on 4 May 1945.\n\nIn 1947 the regiment was reconstituted in the TA as three squadrons with RHQ at Westminster. On 1 September 1951 it reversed its title to become The Westminster Dragoons (2nd County of London Yeomanry). When the TA was reduced on 1 May 1961, the regiment merged with R (Berkshire Yeomanry) Battery, 299 (Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry, Berkshire Yeomanry and The Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, to form the Berkshire and Westminster Dragoons, RAC, in which the Berkshire Yeomanry component formed C Squadron.\n\nThe Westminster Dragoons were disbanded on 30 March 1967 as part of the disbandment of the Territorial Army under the Reserve Forces Act 1966 and its replacement by a newly-constituted organisation, the TAVR (Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve). The legal effect of the Act and the orders implementing it (Army Order 2 dated 28 January 1967 and the Army Reserves Succession Warrant 1967) was that there was no succession of lineage from the disbanded units to those that were being raised. However, the warrant also stated ‘the wish to provide for succession of units raised' and then listed those new units which would be deemed to be successors to previous Territorial Army Units. The Royal Yeomanry Regiment (Volunteers) was to be regarded as the successor to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, the Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry, the North Irish Horse, and the Berkshire and Westminster Dragoons. The squadron based at Chelsea, London was given the title 'Berkshire and Westminster Dragoons', somewhat anomalously given that the Berkshire Yeomanry element was separated to form 94 (Berkshire Yeomanry) Sqn in 71 (Yeomanry) Signal Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals; the situation was belatedly recognised in 1984 when the 'Berkshire' part of the HQ squadron's title was dropped and it was rebadged accordingly as Westminster Dragoons.\n\nA bomb which detonated at the regiment's drill hall in Elverton Street caused minor damage in November 1971. The squadron operated as a medium reconnaissance unit equipped with armoured cars. It continued in this role until 1996, when it became part of the British Army's nuclear, biological and chemical defence regiment. It served in the NBC role until 1999. In that year, the Joint NBC Regiment was formed as a joint regular Army and Royal Air Force unit composed of four squadrons of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment and 27 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment.\n\nIn January 2003, the Westminster Dragoons and A (Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry) Squadron were mobilised (along with augmentees from the Royal Yeomanry's three other squadrons and from the Royal Logistic Corps) for the impending war in Iraq. Together, these mobilised elements became a much-enlarged squadron of the Joint NBC Regiment. Westminster Dragoons found themselves serving with 16 Air Assault Brigade, 7 Armoured Brigade (the Desert Rats) and 3 Commando Brigade as NBC specialists, before switching roles to infantry \"peace support\" operations once Saddam Hussein's regime had collapsed. The squadron also provided individual replacements for Operation Herrick in Afghanistan.\nFollowing the Army 2020 review, the squadron's role became that of light cavalry: providing a rapidly deployable force with fast mobility and substantial firepower as part of the British Army's combat arm. Its soldiers provide reconnaissance, reassurance, security and, if the situation demands it, decisive tactical effects by raiding and attacking the enemy.\n\nThe Imperial Yeomanry's service dress was Khaki with a Slouch hat, officially replaced by a Service cap in 1906. Thanks to Col Burns' links to King Edward VII, the regimental flash worn on the \"pagri\" of the Slouch hat and later Wolseley helmet consisted, with Royal permission, of the King's horseracing colours of purple, gold and red (still used today for the WD's stable belt, \"see above\"). However, when the regiment marched into Palestine with XX Corps in 1917 the flash may have been changed to red, white and blue.\n\nThe regiment's full dress uniform was a scarlet Dragoon tunic with purple facings, blue overalls (tight fitting cavalry trousers) or pantaloons with a single yellow stripe, and a white metal Dragoon helmet with purple plume. The unique plume was changed to white in 1910, shortly after King Edward's funeral, when a detachment of Westminster Dragoons lined the street at Marble Arch: it is thought that the purple dye had run in the rain.\n\nThe other ranks' cap and collar badge was the pre-1965 Coat of arms of the City of Westminster, with portcullis and Tudor rose, but the officers – many of whom had served in the Royal Dragoons – wore a gold-embroidered staff badge used by that regiment before the Battle of Waterloo (\"see above\"). The plate on the original dragoon helmet bore the figure 2 (for 2nd CoL Yeomanry) surrounded by the Garter, with the letters IY beneath.\n\nAt Gallipoli in 1915 the dismounted 1/2nd CoLY wore khaki serge infantry uniforms and webbing equipment with a Wolseley helmet carrying the regimental flash; the only concession was that the puttee tapes were fastened at the bottom, cavalry style. When the regiment rode into Palestine in 1917 the serge tunic was replaced in hot weather with a blue-grey shirt, and brown leather cavalry equipment was worn.\n\nThe black beret became the official headgear of the Royal Tank Corps in 1926 and was thereafter also adopted by the Westminster Dragoons.\n\nThe following officers have served as Honorary Colonel of the unit:\n\n\nThe 2nd County of London Yeomanry (Westminster Dragoons) have been awarded the following battle honours:\nSouth Africa 1902\nCourtrai, France and Flanders 1918, Suvla, Scimitar Hill, Gallipoli 1915, Suez Canal, Egypt 1915–17, Gaza, El Mughar, Jerusalem, Palestine 1917–18\nNormandy Landing, Villers Bocage, Venraij, Meijel, Venlo Pocket, Roer, North-West Europe 1944–45\nIraq 2003 (as part of the Royal Yeomanry)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1939339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939339", "title": "Hearts of Stone", "text": "Hearts of Stone\n\n\"Hearts of Stone\" is an American R&B song. It was written by Eddie Ray and Rudy Jackson, a member of the San Bernardino, California-based rhythm and blues vocal group the Jewels (no relation to the female group The Jewels from Washington, DC) which first recorded it for the R&B label in 1954.

The Charms' version of the song went to number one on the R&B Best Sellers and number fifteen on the pop charts.\n\nA different song, also with the name \"Hearts of Stone\", was written by Bruce Springsteen and recorded during the \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" sessions (appears on the anthology box set \"Tracks\").

Litharge is a secondary mineral which forms from the oxidation of galena ores. It forms as coatings and encrustations with internal tetragonal crystal structure. It is dimorphous with the orthorhombic form massicot. It forms soft (Mohs hardness of 2), red, greasy-appearing crusts with a very high specific gravity of 9.14–9.35. PbO may be prepared by heating lead metal in air at approximately 600 °C (lead melts at only 300 °C). At this temperature it is also the end product of oxidation of other lead oxides in air. This is often done with a set of bellows pumping air over molten lead and causing the oxidized product to slip or fall off the top into a receptacle, where it quickly solidifies in minute scales.\n\nHistorically, the term \"litharge\" has been combined to refer to other similar substances. For example, \"litharge of gold\" is litharge mixed with red lead, giving it a red color; \"litharge of bismuth\" is a similar result of the oxidation of bismuth; \"litharge of silver\" is litharge that comes as a by-product of separating silver from lead, in fact \"litharge\" originally meant the mineral residue from silver refining. The term has also been used as a synonym for white lead or red lead.\n\nAccording to Probert, \"silver ore, litharge (crude lead oxide) flux and charcoal were mixed and smelted in very small clay and stone furnaces. Resulting silver-bearing lead bullion was later refined in a second furnace which yielded fine silver, and litharge skimmings which were used again.\"\n\n"}

The route was designated in 1956 and has remained unchanged since.\n\nHighway 538 is a short and narrow highway which follows a former alignment of Highway 17, at which it begins and ends. It starts in the west at Algoma Mills, travelling east initially before turning south and passing beneath a CPR rail line. The route descends along the western bank of Lauzon Creek before turning southeast and crossing it.\nIt passes several shops and continues towards the shoreline, at which point it curves northeast. The highway travels around Bootlegger's Bay before diverging from the shoreline, turning north and ascending towards Highway 17. From this point until its eastern terminus, the highway travels alongside a parcel of the North Channel Inshore Provincial Park, a waterway park scattered along the North Channel shoreline.\nImmediately south of Highway 17 and the CPR tracks, the route curves east and follows parallel to Highway 17 for several kilometres. Following this, it abruptly curves north, crosses the railroad tracks and ends.\n\nLike other provincial routes in Ontario, Highway 538 is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In 2010, traffic surveys conducted by the ministry showed that on average, 140 vehicles used the highway daily along the section between Highway 17 and Miranda Boulevard in Algoma Mills while 60 vehicles did so each day along the section east of there, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.\n\nHighway 538 was designated in 1956.\nIt was once an alignment of Highway 17, but was bypassed due to several sharp corners.

{"id": "1939368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939368", "title": "Imogiri", "text": "Imogiri\n\nImogiri (also Imagiri) is a royal graveyard complex in Yogyakarta, in south-central Java, Indonesia, as well as a modern village located near the graveyard in Bantul Regency. Imogiri is a traditional resting place for the royalty of central Java, including many rulers of the Sultanate of Mataram and of the current houses of Surakarta and Yogyakarta Sultanate. The name Imagiri is derived from Sanskrit \"Himagiri\", which means 'mountain of snow'. The latter is another name for \"Himalaya\".\n\nThe Royal Graveyard that preceded was Kota Gede. The graveyard was constructed by Sultan Agung of Mataram in the later years of his reign, probably in the 1640s.\n\nThe graveyard is a significant pilgrimage ziarah site, particularly on significant dates in the Javanese calendar (such as Satu Suro, New Year's Day), and the Islamic calendar.\n\nIt also belongs to a larger network of significant locations in Javanese pilgrimage traditions. It is possibly the only major location remaining in Java where the Palaces of Surakarta and Yogyakarta have personnel manning a jointly administered royal graveyard.\n\nAmong the site's most prominent graves are that of early Mataram ruler Sultan Agung, and Sultan of Yogyakarta Hamengkubuwono IX, a leader during Indonesia's war for independence. The most recent is that of Pakubuwana XII of Surakarta who was buried in 2004.\n\nFolklore collected by Pranata in the 1970s, suggest that unusual stones in the steps preceding Sultan Agung's section of the graveyard cover the remains of Jan Pieterszoon Coen, which were allegedly stolen from the grave of 1629 in Batavia during the Siege of Batavia. \n\nThe Imogiri complex is separated into three parts, named Giriloyo, Banyusumurup and Imogiri. Traditionally it is accepted that Giriloyo was the earliest of the three graveyards. In some local folklore, Sultan Agung had commenced work on his own graveyard at Giriloyo - but because his uncle Juminah died at the graveyard, Agung was guided by various portents to choose his graveyard on a hill some three kilometres to the southwest, at Imogiri. A later ruler, needing to bury outcasts in a graveyard separate from Giriloyo and Imogiri, chose Banyusumurup as an appropriate site. However it is possible to find rivals and enemies within Javanese royal families buried within metres of each other inside the walls of Imogiri.\n\nThe Imogiri complex has had ongoing renovations since initial construction, due to exposure to tropical rain and weather, most materials at the graveyard have requires continual upkeep. Pakubuwono X during his reign spent a large amount of money on upgrading the Juru Kunci administration buildings in Imogiri village, the Mosque at the foot of the stairs, the stairs and the Graveyard in general. He also constructed the Girimulya section as well. Hamengkubuwana VIII in the process of constructing Saptorenggo in the 1920s also conducted repairs on the earlier structures that required repairs. Various Suharto-era bureaucrats and army personnel with connections with branches of earlier rulers contributed to a number of roof renewals and other renovations. The Indonesian Government contributed to a project that rehabilitated the yard known by its split gate - the Supit Urang - under the auspices of the archaeology service and appropriate agencies in the 1980s. In the 1990s the main gate into Sultan Agungan also required repairs.\n\nThe 2006 earthquake in the region saw considerable damage to the complex. It is not known yet to what extent repairs and renovations are possible again, and from where the funds will emanate.\n\nMany travel accounts, tourist guides and references to Imogiri imply a simple single whole. On closer examination the graveyard has more complexity within its structure. The complex is divided in two ways. First, there are separate Yogyakartan and Surakartan sections. Second, the whole graveyard is divided into eight sections which constitute three generations of ruler in each section. Some are jointly governed by custodians (\"Juru Kunci\") from Surakarta and Yogyakarta, while some are governed by representatives of one of these palaces only. The original area within the Imogiri graveyard is that area with Sultan Agung's grave - it is jointly governed. The western wing of the graveyard is the Surakartan section, while the eastern wing is the Yogyakartan section.\n\nNot all rulers of the Sultanate of Mataram are buried in the Imogiri complex; there are a number of rulers who are buried elsewhere in Java. Some immediate families of rulers were also buried in Imogiri, but not all; this was dependent upon each ruler's preferences. Printed lists of the burial plots within the royal graveyard complex are maintained for Imogiri to provide guidance for researchers looking for a specific grave site. This process is sometimes complicated by the multiple names some individuals were known by during their lives.\n\nEach section is a walled compound with three internal sections - variation may occur in transcription for these terms.\n\nNote that dates after rulers name are supposed dates of interment, variant dates are possible in some sources. They are given in Gregorian calendar years. Dates after construction are arbitrary and may vary up to 10 years. In most cases the new walled compounds have been built prior to the death of the first ruler interred. However it is possible that the grave precedes the walls, as is probably the case in Sultan Agungan, and those that follow. Most names listed have abbreviated forms, for Javanese royalty there are usually extra titles when written, any abbreviation here is for purposes of the list and not out of disrespect for the deceased or their status.\n\nThe following list is in the assumed order of construction of the walled areas at Imogiri. The first two are in the shared parts; afterwards, as the kingdom split, the sections are for the Yogyakartan and Surakartan rulers are separate.\n\nMost sections have a sequence of three generations - 'Ego' or Father, Son and grandson, where the succession is that simple. The ones that don't are: Kasuwargan Yogyakarta has a missing person (Hamengkubuwana II is buried at Kota Gede); Kapingsangan Surakarta has four due to family dynamics. Much earlier, Amangkurat I was buried at Tegal on the north coast of Java, and as a consequence is not in Paku Buwanan.\nJuru Kunci Surakarta and Yogyakarta share the tending of the graves and courtyards in Sultan Agungan and Paku Buwanan.\nInternational tourists are usually encouraged to enter the yard prior to Sultan Agungan, pay a registration, put on appropriate clothing, and visit Sultan Agungan.\nImogiri is now 'full up', both the Girimulya and Saptorenggo sections have three generations interred, unless the traditional practice is changed for any reason, the current living rulers in Surakarta and Yogyakarta would now need to prepare a new section each on each 'side' of the graveyard to continue the practice of the last 400 years. The construction works of the new section of the Yogyakarta side has been started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sarah, after giving birth to two more daughters died when Jessie was about seven. William remarried Clara King who gave birth to five more children. The elder siblings were born in Surrey, but youngest son Clarence was born in Kent. Jessie, her sister Frances and brother Clarence later moved to Bournemouth, where Jessie began her writing career, remaining there until around 1903. Her home at 65 Lansdowne Road still stands, as of 2010. Jessie studied in Hildesheim then Paris, France under Gaston Paris. She also studied at the Crystal Palace School of Art.\n\nOne of her first printed works was a lengthy sentimental verse called \"The Rose-Tree of Hildesheim\". A narrative about \"sacrifice and denial\", it was modelled on the story of the Thousand-year Rose, which grows on a wall at Hildesheim Cathedral. Published in 1896, it was the title verse in an omnibus of her poems.\n\nHer best-known work is \"From Ritual to Romance\" (1920). In it she brought to bear an analysis harking back to James George Frazer on the Grail legend, arguing for origins earlier than the Christian or Celtic sources conventionally discussed at the time. It was cited by T. S. Eliot in his notes to \"The Waste Land\". He later claimed, in his lecture The Frontiers of Criticism (1956), that his original intention was merely to add the references he had employed, to counter earlier criticisms of his work as plagiarizing. More extensive notes were requested by the publisher to bulk out the length of the poem in book form, calling them \"bogus scholarship\".\n\nIt also caused her to be dismissed as a theosophist by F. L. Lucas, in a hostile review of Eliot's poem. The interpretation of the Grail quest as mystical and connected to self-realisation, which she added to the anthropological layer of reading, was to become increasingly popular during the 1920s. According to Richard Barber in \"The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief\", the Wasteland as theme in the Grail romances is of minor importance until the last works of the cycle, and the emphasis on fertility is \"an interpretation which has haunted twentieth-century literature to a degree quite disproportionate to its basis in fact\". The book appears in the film \"Apocalypse Now\" amongst those kept by the character Kurtz, along with \"The Golden Bough\".\n\nWhile Weston's work on the Grail theme has been derided as fanciful speculation in the years since the publication of \"From Ritual to Romance\" (even one-time supporter Roger Sherman Loomis eventually abandoned her hypothesis), her editions of numerous medieval romances have been commended as valuable translations.\n\nA biography \"In Quest of Jessie Weston\" by Janet Grayson appears in \"Arthurian Literature,\" Vol 11 (1992).\n\n\n"}

Varnum was active, but brief. He graduated at \"twenty\"; was admitted to the bar at \"twenty-two\"; entered the army at \"twenty-seven\"; resigned his commission at \"thirty-one\"; was member of Congress the same year; resumed practice at \"thirty-three\", and continued four years, was elected to Congress again at \"thirty-seven\"; emigrated to the west at \"thirty-nine\", and died at the early age of \"forty\".\"\n\nJames Mitchell Varnum was \"a man of boundless zeal, of warm feelings, of great honesty, of singular disinterestedness; and, as to talents, of prodigal imagination, a dextrous reasoner, and a splendid orator. He was a man made on a gigantic scale; his very defects were masculine and powerful, 'and, we shall not soon look upon his like again.'\"\n\nJames Mitchell Varnum was born in Dracut, Massachusetts. As a young man he matriculated at Harvard College only to transfer to the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, more commonly known as \"Rhode Island College\" (the college later named Brown University), He graduated with honors in the college's first graduating class in September 1769. In Rhode Island he met his future wife, Martha \"Patty\" Child, whom he married on February 2, 1770.\n\nHe then studied law under Rhode Island Attorney General Oliver Arnold and was admitted to the bar in 1771. He settled in East Greenwich, Rhode Island and pursued the practice of law. He began construction of his home, a colonial mansion now known as the Varnum House, in 1773.\n\nIn October 1774, while tensions were rising between the American colonies and Great Britain, Varnum was elected as captain in command of the newly organized Kentish Guards, a chartered militia company in Varnum's home town of East Greenwich. Another member of the company was Private Nathanael Greene who would rise to become one of the most distinguished officers in the Continental Army and would soon be Varnum's immediate superior. No fewer than 30 other members of the Kentish Guards would also serve as officers in the Continental Army.\n\nIn May 1775, following the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Varnum was commissioned as colonel in command of one of the three regiments from Rhode Island, under the command of Brigadier General Nathanael Greene, which served in the Army of Observation during the Siege of Boston. In early July 1775 General George Washington arrived in Cambridge to take command of the Army of Observation which then became the Continental Army.\n\nIn the early part of war regiments were identified by the name of their commanding officer. Varnum's Regiment was renamed as the 9th Continental Regiment on January 1, 1776.\n\nVarnum's regiment served throughout the Siege of Boston which ended with the evacuation of the British army on March 17, 1776. In early April the regiment marched to New York where it participated in several battles, including the Long Island and White Plains, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the British from occupying the city.\n\nIn December 1776 Varnum returned to Rhode Island to recruit more soldiers for the Rhode Island units in the Continental Army who's enlistments were about to expire. On December 12 Varnum accepted a commission as a brigadier general in Rhode Island Militia and given command of the state's brigade which guarded the state's mainland from possible attack from the British forces which had recently occupied the important port city of Newport.\n\nVarnum's stay in Rhode Island was brief because he was commissioned as a brigadier general in the Continental Army in February 1777. He then served as a brigade commander until he resigned in March 1779. During this period he served at the battles of Red Bank, New Jersey in 1777 and the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778. He was also at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777 to 1778.\n\nVarnum advocated allowing freed African American slaves to enlist in the Continental Army, which resulted in the reorganization of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment as a racially integrated unit in 1778. Varnum was a disciple of Major General Charles Lee and a serious critic of the position of Inspector General held in 1778 by Baron Von Steuben.\n\nIn March 1779 Varnum resigned his Continental Army commission because of personal business matters. He was commissioned as the major general in command of the Rhode Island Militia in May 10, 1779 and held the position until he was relieved by Major General (and future U.S. Senator) Joseph Stanton, Jr. on May 7, 1788. He led Rhode Island troops in the service of the United States in July and August, 1780, under the Comte de Rochambeau who commanded the French army sent by King Louis XVI of France.\n\nIn common with 33 of the 81 generals in the Continental Army, Varnum was a Freemason. He attended St. John's Lodge, No. 1 in Providence.\n\nIn 1783, at the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, along with General George Washington, Nathanael Greene, Henry Knox, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and numerous others, General Varnum became an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati and served as president of the Rhode Island Society, following the death of Nathanael Greene, from 1786 until his death in 1789.\n\nHe represented Rhode Island at the Continental Congress in Philadelphia from May 3, 1780 to May 1, 1782 and in the 8th Confederation Congress which convened in New York from November 6, 1786 to October 30, 1787. The 8th Confederation Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance on July 13, 1787 which opened settlement in the Northwest Territories (now the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota).\n\nVarnum was also well known as a jurist. He successfully represented the defendant in \"Trevett v. Weeden\", one of the earliest cases of judicial review.\n\nOn August 29, 1787 he was chosen as one of the directors of the Ohio Company of Associates. On October 14 of the same year, Varnum was appointed as one of two \"supreme\" judges for the Northwest Territory. He then moved to Marietta, Ohio, to take up his duties. He was one of the early pioneers to the Northwest Territory, arriving in Marietta on June 5, 1788.\n\nShortly after his arrival Varnum was chosen to be the orator of the day for the celebration of American independence on July 4.\n\nVarnum then assisted Territorial Governor Arthur St. Clair, who took office on July 15, in creating a code of laws for the territory. This proved to be Varnum's only significant accomplishment in Ohio as he was overcome with consumption which was exacerbated by his long journey westward.\n\nGeneral Varnum died in January 1789, only seven months after his arrival in Marietta, of consumption. He was originally interred in the Mound Cemetery near the original settlement and later reburied the Oak Grove Cemetery in Marietta.\n\nHis college classmate the distinguished physician Solomon Drowne eulogized him during an oration at the one-year anniversary celebration of the founding of Marietta:\n\nBut of these worthies who have most exerted themselves in promoting this settlement, one, alas! is no more; one whose eloquence, like the music of Orpheus, attractive of the listening crowd, seemed designed to reconcile mankind to the closest bonds of society. Ah! what avail his manly virtues now! Slow through yon winding path his corse was borne, and on the steepy hill interred with funeral honors meet. What bosom refuses the tribute of a sigh, on the recollection of that melancholy scene, when, unusual spectacle, the fathers of the land, the chiefs of the aboriginal nations, in solemn train attended; while the mournful dirge was rendered doubly mournful mid the gloomy nodding grove. On that day even nature seemed to mourn. O Varnum ! Varnum! thy name shall not be forgotten, while gratitude and generosity continue to be the characteristics of those inhabiting the country, once thy care. Thy fair fame is deeply rooted in our fostering memories ...\nGeneral Varnum was the son of Samuel Varnum (1715–1797) and his second wife Hannah Mitchell. He had three brothers and two sisters of which only two brothers, Joseph Bradley Varnum (1751–1821) and Samuel Varnum (1762–1822), lived to maturity.\n\nJoseph Bradley Varnum served as a United States Representative from Massachusetts from 1795 to 1811 and then as a United States Senator from 1811 to 1817.\n\nGeneral Varnum's home, the Gen. James Mitchell Varnum House in East Greenwich, Rhode Island is a historic house museum today. Varnum's brother was Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Joseph Bradley Varnum.\n\nThe Varnum Continentals, an historic military command in East Greenwich, were founded in 1907 and are named after General Varnum.\n\n\n\n"}

They are lightweight and can be put up rapidly, and camouflaged simply with foliage specific to the area of operation. Their low profile gives them a small silhouette, and many are also infra-red reflective, which makes them, and their occupants, less visible to infrared detection equipment. Normally bashas are erected in woods, as the trees both serve to give visual cover and support the basha through bungee cords or rope. Because they are nearly invisible if well camouflaged, they are ideal for forming covert observation posts.\n\nThe word 'basha' is an Assamese word meaning a 'hut' taking the form of naturally fabricated shelters made of bamboo and palm materials, it most probably first entered British Army vocabulary to mean a temporary shelter by Chindits operating behind enemy lines in Burma, with the sheet taking its name from this usage.

The majority of Latin American Canadians are multilingual, primarily speaking Spanish or Portuguese. Most are fluent in one or both of Canada's two official languages, English and French. Spanish, Portuguese and French are Romance languages and share some similarities in morphology and syntax.\n\nLatin American Canadians have made distinguished contributions to Canada in all major fields, including politics, the military, music, philosophy, sports, business and economy, and science.\n\nThe largest Latin American immigrant groups in Canada are Mexican Canadians, Colombian Canadians and Salvadoran Canadians.\n\nLatin Americans comprise a heterogeneous variation of ancestral and racial origins that span from South and North America to Europe, Africa, and Asia. Therefore, a Latin American can be of any ancestry but the most frequent ancestral backgrounds found in the region are Mestizos, Whites and Native Americans. Blacks/Afro-Latinos, Arabs and Asians are also common.\n\nThe majority of Latin American Canadians are recent immigrants who arrived in the late 20th century from Mexico, Colombia, El Salvador, Peru, and Brazil, with smaller communities from Chile, Venezuela, Argentina, Cuba, Guatemala, and elsewhere, with nearly all Latin American countries represented. Reasons for immigrating include Canada's better economic opportunities and politics or civil war and political repression in their native countries, as in the case of Cubans fleeing from the Fidel Castro revolution, Chileans escaping from Augusto Pinochet's rule, Salvadorans fleeing from the Salvadoran Civil War, Peruvians escaping from the Juan Velasco Alvarado dictatorship, Dominicans opposed to the regimes of Rafael Trujillo and Joaquin Balaguer, Mexicans escaping from the Mexican Drug War, Colombians from the violence in their country and Venezuelans opposed to the rule of the Socialist Unity Party.\n\nAs of the 2016 Canadian Census, the largest Latin American Canadian communities are in the census metropolitan areas of Toronto (132,945), Montreal (110,200), Vancouver (34,800), Calgary (27,710), Edmonton (18,755), Ottawa (15,635), and Hamilton (10,910). The fastest growing are in the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia.\n\n\nSource: Canada 2016 Census<br>National average: 1.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2002, 82% of those who reported Latin American origin said they had a strong sense of belonging to Canada. At the same time, 57% said that they had a strong sense of belonging to their ethnic or cultural group.\n\nPeople with Latin American origins are also active in Canadian society. For example, 66% of Canadians of Latin American origin who were eligible to vote did so in the 2000 federal election.\n\nThe Latin American community of Quebec was brought into the spotlight when 18-year-old Honduran immigrant Fredy Alberto Villanueva was shot and killed by police officers of the SPVM on 9 August 2008. The following day, what started out as a peaceful protest against the officers' actions in the borough of Montréal-Nord erupted into a riot in which neighborhood stores were looted, several cars and garbage cans were set on fire, one paramedic and two police officers were wounded and one female police officer was shot.\n\n"}

According to the 2016 Census, there were 482,610 or 1.4% of Canadians claimed full or partial Portuguese ancestry, an increase compared to 410,850 in 2006 (1.3% of the nation's total population). Most Portuguese Canadians live in Ontario - 282,865 (69%), followed by Quebec 57,445 (14%) and British Columbia 34,660 (8%).\n\nThe Portuguese Canadian community chose 2003 as the year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their officially sponsored immigration to Canada. The Honourable David Collenette, Minister of Transport and Minister Responsible for Canada Post, said that \"the Portuguese Canadian community is a vibrant group that enriches the Canadian mosaic with its history, language, culture and work ethic.\" He added that Canada Post was proud to be issuing a stamp honouring Portuguese Canadians during the month of June, when cultural celebrations honouring the life of 16th-century poet Luís de Camões, considered Portugal's greatest poet, were taking place in many communities across the country.\n\nPortugal played a pioneering role in the explorations of the New World in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the 15th century, Prince Henry of Portugal, better known as Henry the Navigator, established a school of navigation in Sagres, in the Algarve region of Portugal. From this school emerged explorers who found their way to the Indies, South America, North America and Africa, including Gaspar Corte-Real, who was one of the earliest European explorers of Canada. Corte-Real explored the northeast coast of \"Terra Nova\", naming Conception Bay, Portugal Cove, and Labrador, named after Portuguese explorer João Fernandes Lavrador. João Alvares Fagundes also explored Nova Scotia.\n\nDuring the 1950s, a large number of immigrants from the Azores and Madeira, fleeing political conflict with the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar, moved into the downtown core of Canada's major cities such as the area of Portugal Village in Toronto, Ontario and further west along Dundas Street to Brockton Village. The stretch of Dundas Street passing through Brockton Village is also known as \"Rua Açores\". From the 1970s, increasing numbers of Brazilians moved into this area.\n\nThe Toronto suburbs of Brampton and Mississauga contain large Portuguese communities.\n\nAs Azoreans came to Canada from 1953 into the 1970s, numerous Holy Spirit Societies, reminiscent of the spiritual celebration of the Holy Spirit and cultural tradition present in each village in the Azores Islands, were set up by individuals from the community coming together. They participate in the International Conference of the Festivals of the Holy Spirit, which united Azorean communities around the world yearly.\n\nMontreal has the second most populous number of Portuguese immigrants with an estimated 47,000. Most started immigrating in the 1960s and settled in the Le Plateau-Mont-Royal mainly around Saint Laurent Boulevard and Rachel Street. Many Portuguese stores and restaurants are located in Little Portugal.\n\nHamilton, Ontario also has a solid Portuguese community concentrated in the downtown core around Barton and James Street and nearby the St. Mary's Roman Catholic church. This area in Hamilton is known as \"Jamesville\" and is shared with a neighbouring Italian population. London, Ontario's significant Portuguese community is concentrated in the east end and south end of the city, with Portuguese restaurants and shops situated on Hamilton Road.\n\nRecently, a number of Canadians of Goan heritage have opted to pursue Portuguese citizenship they are entitled to through their heritage as a result of Goa being an overseas province of Portugal till 1961, thus adding to the Portuguese Canadian population in Canada.\n\nThe first recorded Portuguese individual to immigrate to British Columbia was \"Portuguese Joe\" Silvie, from Pico Island. He arrived in BC around 1858 via California, after years in the American whaling industry. He married Khaltinaht a daughter of Grand Chief Kiapilano, and their daughter was the first child born in Vancouver of European origin, Elizabeth Walker (née Silvey). They lived in a cabin built in what is now Stanley Park and he ran Vancouver's second saloon, and was a fisherman as well. However his wife died in 1871, and in years later married a Sechelt First Nation (Shishalh) woman named Kwaham Kwatleematt (Lucy). They later moved to Reid Island where their family grew to 10 children. Portuguese Joe died in 1902, and has approximately 500 descendant. A statue in his memory now stands in Stanley Park, meters away from the totem pole display. \n\nBritish Columbia has around 35 000 Portuguese-Canadians, concentrated in the Lower Mainland (Vancouver, Surrey, Richmond, Burnaby, Delta, Coquitlam) with around 20 000 Portuguese Canadians. Other centres for Portuguese immigrants and their descendants are Kitimat, Prince Rupert, Victoria, and the Okanagan Region where many are fruit farmers. Many are of Azorean heritage.\n\nIn Vancouver there is a Portuguese Catholic Church, Portuguese Canadian Senior's Society, Portuguese Brotherhood of the Divine Holy Spirit with members originally from Flores Island, Azores and São Miguel Island, Tradition of Terceira (Tradição da Terceira), Friends of Pico (Amigos do Pico), and several folk dance groups, including. Cruz de Cristo (regions of Mainland Portugal), Pico, Sao Miguel Island and Madeira.\n\nAs Azoreans came to Canada from 1953 into the 1970s, numerous Holy Spirit Societies, reminiscent of the spiritual celebration of the Holy Spirit and cultural tradition present in each village in the Azores Islands, were set up by individuals from the community coming together. They participate in the International Conference of the Festivals of the Holy Spirit, which united Azorean communities around the world yearly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Portuguese-Canadians adopt the name \"Luso-Canadians\" for their local social and business clubs, in reference to Lusitania, the ancient name associated with Portugal under the Roman Empire (and nowadays used in the Portuguese language as a synonym for \"Portuguese\". The attendance growth of organizations indicate the growth in small business and universities throughout the community.\n\nLeading as a national voice, one can find the \"Congresso\", the Luso-Canadiano National Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The movies in which she was paired opposite Uttam Kumar became classics in the history of Bengali cinema.\n\nSen was the first Indian actress to receive an award at an international film festival when, at the 1963 Moscow International Film Festival, she won the Silver Prize for Best Actress for \"Saat Pake Bandha\". In 1972, she was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India. From 1979 on, she retreated from public life and shunned all forms of public contact; for this she is often compared to Greta Garbo. In 2005, she refused the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest cinematic award in India, to stay out of the public eye. In 2012, she was conferred the West Bengal Government's highest honour: Banga Bibhushan. Her first official release was Sukumar Dasgupta's \"Saat Number Kayedi\" (1953). She was catapulted to stardom after she was cast as Vishnupriya by Devaki Kumar Bose in his \"Bhagaban Shree Krishna Chaitanya\" (1953).\n\nRama Dasgupto aka Suchitra Sen was born on 6 April 1931, in a Bangali family of Bhanga Bari village of Belkuchi Upozila, now in Sirajgonj District, Greater Pabna. Her father, the late Korunamoy Dasgupto was a sanitation officer in Pabna Municipality. Her mother, the late Indira Devi was a homemaker. She was their fifth child and second daughter. Sen is a granddaughter of the poet Rajonikant Sen. She received her formal education in Pabna Government Girls High School. The violence of Partition in 1947, brought her family to West Bengal, which was comparably a safe zone for Bengalis. where she married Dibanath Sen, son of wealthy industrialist Adinath Sen, in 1947, at the age of 15 years. and had one daughter, Moon Moon Sen, who is a former actress. Her father-in-law, Adinath Sen, was supportive of her acting career in films after her marriage. Her industrialist husband invested greatly in her career and supported her.\n\nSen had made a successful entry into Bengali films in 1952, and then a less successful transition into the Hindi movie industry. According to persistent but unconfirmed reports in the Bengali press, her marriage was strained by her success in the film industry.\n\nSuchitra Sen made her debut in films with \"Shesh Kothaay\" in 1952, but it was never released. The following year saw her act opposite Uttam Kumar in \"Sharey Chuattor\", a film by Nirmal Dey. It was a box-office hit and is remembered for launching Uttam-Suchitra as a leading pair. They went on to become the icons for Bengali dramas for more than 20 years, becoming almost a genre unto themselves. She has acted in 30 of her 60 films with Uttam Kumar. She received a Best Actress Award nomination for the film \"Devdas\" (1955), which was her first Hindi movie. Her Bengali melodramas and romances, especially with Uttam Kumar, made her the most famous Bengali actress ever.\n\nHer films ran through the 1960s and '70s. Her husband died in 1970 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Suchitra went on to act in films such as in the Hindi film \"Aandhi\" (1974). \"Aandhi\" was inspired by India's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Sen received a Filmfare Award nomination as Best Actress, while Sanjeev Kumar, who played the role of her husband, won the Filmfare as Best Actor.\n\nOne of her best known performances was in \"Deep Jwele Jaai\" (1959). She played in a character named Radha Mitra, a hospital nurse employed by a progressive psychiatrist, Pahadi Sanyal, who is expected to develop a personal relationship with male patients as part of their therapy. Sanyal diagnoses the hero, Basanta Choudhury, as having an unresolved Oedipal dilemma. He orders Radha to play the role though she is hesitant as in a similar case she had fallen in love with the patient. She finally agrees and bears up to Choudhury's violence, impersonates his mother, sings his poetic compositions and in the process falls in love again. In the end, even as she brings about his cure, she suffers a nervous breakdown. The film is noted for its partly lit close-ups of Sen, which set the tone of the film. Asit Sen remade the film in Hindi as \"Khamoshi\" (1969), with Waheeda Rehman in the Suchitra Sen role.\n\nSuchitra Sen's other landmark film with Asit Sen was \"Uttar Falguni\" (1963). She plays the dual role of a courtesan, Pannabai, and her daughter Suparna, a lawyer. Critics note that she brought a great deal of poise, grace and dignity to the role of a fallen woman determined to see her daughter grow up in a good, clean environment.\n\nSuchitra Sen's international success came in 1963, when she won the best actress award at the Moscow International Film Festival for the movie \"Saat Paake Bandha\", becoming the first Indian actress to receive an international film award.\n\nA film critic summed up Suchitra Sen's career and continuing legacy as \"one half of one of Indian cinema's most popular and abiding screen pairs, Suchitra Sen redefined stardom in a way that few actors have done, combining understated sensuality, feminine charm and emotive force and a no-nonsense \"gravitas\" to carve out a persona that has never been matched, let alone surpassed in Indian cinema\"\n\nSuchitra Sen refused Satyajit Ray's offer due to a scheduling problem. As a result, Ray never made the film \"Devi Chaudhurani\", based on the novel written by Rishi Bankim Chandra Chattopadhya. She also refused Raj Kapoor's offer for a film under the RK banner.\n\nSen continued to act after her husband's death in 1970, but called it a day when \"Pronoy Pasha\" flopped, and retired from the screen in 1978 after a career of over 25 years to a life of quiet seclusion. She was to do a film project; \"Nati Binodini\", also starring Rajesh Khanna, but the film was shelved mid-way after shooting when she decided to quit acting.\n\nShe assiduously avoided the public gaze after her retirement and devoted her time to the Ramakrishna Mission.\n\nSuchitra Sen was admitted to the hospital on 24 December 2013 and was diagnosed with a lung infection. She was reported to have been recovering well in the first week of January. She died at 8.25 am on 17 January 2014, due to a heart attack. She was 82 years old.\n\nSuchitra Sen's death was condoled by many leaders, including the President of India Dr. Pranab Mukherjee, the Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, and BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. A gun salute was given before her cremation, upon the orders of Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal.\n\nRespecting her fierce desire for complete privacy, her last rites were performed at Kolkata's Kaioratola crematorium, barely five and half hours after she died, with her coffin reaching the crematorium in a flower-decked hearse with dark-tinted windows. Despite being Bengal's greatest star, referred to as \"Mahanayika\", she had consciously chosen to step into oblivion and she remained an enigma till her last, although thousands of fans had converged at the crematorium to catch one last glimpse of their idol. Her entire medical treatment had also been done in seclusion and secrecy.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1978, both in Bengali and Hindi, Suchitra Sen acted in 61 films. \n\nSen received 10 awards during her lifetime. In 1963, she became the first Indian actress to receive an international award.\n\n"}

He is noted for his victories at the Battle of Dungans Hill and the Battle of Rathmines, which facilitated the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.\n\nThe son of Lewis Jones (1560–1646), a Welshman who settled in Ireland, becoming Bishop of Killaloe, the young Jones was a student at Lincoln's Inn when the Civil War began, but fought in the army of Charles I during the early part of the Irish Rebellion of 1641.\n\nAfter the cessation of hostilities in Ireland in 1643 the extreme party among the Irish Protestants determined to send Jones and other representatives to press their views on the king during the negotiations for the treaty with the Irish rebels, which were to take place at Oxford in the spring of 1644. Carte prints a speech which Jones addressed to Ormonde on behalf of his fellow-commissioners. Finding, however, that he would be expected to bring over his company to join the Royalist army in England, Jones declined to act, and shortly afterwards entered the service of Parliament.\n\nJones speedily distinguished himself as a cavalry leader. He took part in the defeats of the royalists at Tarvin (21 August 1644), at Malpas (26 August 1644), and in the repulse of John, Lord Byron's attempt to relieve Beeston Castle on 18 January 1645. On 18 September 1645 Jones, together with Adjutant-general Lowthian, stormed the suburbs of Chester, and six days later helped Poyntz to gain a victory at the Battle of Rowton Heath. On 1 November 1645 Colonels Jones and Thomas Mytton defeated at Denbigh the troops which Sir William Vaughan had collected for the relief of Chester, and in December Jones routed another relieving force at Holt-bridge, and captured its commander, Sir William Byron. On 6 February 1646 the surrender of Chester, Jones was appointed governor of the city by Parliament.\n\nBut his skill and courage, his family connection with Ireland, and his knowledge of the conditions of Irish warfare marked him out for employment in the suppression of the Irish rebellion. On 3 July 1646 it was voted that the horse regiments of Colonels Jones and Sydney should be immediately despatched to Ireland, but he did not actually set out till a year later. Originally it was intended to appoint him deputy-governor of Dublin under Algernon Sydney, but as early as 24 March 1647 he is spoken of as \"commander-in-chief of the forces employed in this service of Dublin\", and on 9 April an ordinance was passed appointing him governor. Jones and the other parliamentary commissioners landed at Dublin on 7 June 1647, and concluded a treaty with Earl of Ormonde (His old Royalist commander) for the delivery of Dublin and other places still in his possession on 18 June 1647. Ormonde agreed the terms and surrendered Dublin to him without a fight in June 1647 saying that he \"preferred English rebels to Irish ones\".\n\nWhen Jones landed in Dublin, he brought with him 5,000 English Parliamentarian soldiers. In addition to this, he inherited 3,000 English Royalist soldiers who had been under Ormonde's command. Jones persuaded these men to switch their allegiance to the Parliamentarians in order to fight the Irish Confederates. He began by reorganising the army and suppressing free quarter.\n\nHis first expeditions from Dublin were unsuccessful, but he was obliged to fight not so much for victory, but, as Bellings expresses it, \"for bread and elbow-room\".\n\nOn 1 August he set out to relieve Trim, and General Thomas Preston seized the opportunity to make a dash at Dublin during his absence. Jones relieved Trim and then overtook Preston, defeating him at Battle of Dungans Hill, by routing his horse, destroying his infantry, and capturing all his artillery and baggage. More than two hundred officers were taken, and over three thousand Irish killed. Borlase terms it \"the greatest and most signal victory the English ever had in Ireland\". This was the best trained and best equipped Confederate army and the loss of its manpower and equipment was a body blow to the Confederation.\n\nWant of money and supplies prevented Jones from availing himself of his success to its full extent, but it enabled him considerably to enlarge his area of control. The skilful strategy of Owen Roe O'Neill checked his further progress. In 1648 the outbreak of the Second English Civil War and the return of Ormonde with a new commission from the king caused a revolution in the relations of Irish parties. Jones resorted to diplomacy, sought to play off the extreme catholic party against the Royalists and the Confederates, concluded a temporary cessation of arms with O'Neill, and assisted the ambitious efforts of the Earl of Antrim. He provided against the anticipated desertion of some of his own officers to Ormonde by arresting them and shipping them to England. On the news of the execution of Charles I Ormonde wrote to Jones, urging him to abandon the cause of the regicides, and join the Irish in asserting the authority of Charles II. \"I conceive it\", characteristically answered Jones, \"no part of my work and care to take notice of any proceedings of state foreign to my charge and trust here … The intermeddling of governors and parties in this kingdom, with sidings and parties in England, have been the very betraying of this kingdom to the Irish\".\n\nIn the summer of 1649 Ormonde marched against the last English garrisons. Drogheda and Dundalk were taken, and on 19 June he laid siege to Dublin with an army of about seven thousand foot and four thousand horse. Jones's forces were weakened by desertion, his stores of corn spent, his troops paid only by a weekly assessment on Dublin. He could not take the field for fear of mutiny or treachery in his absence. Fortunately between 22 July and 26 July sixteen hundred foot and six hundred horse arrived from England. Ormonde seized the old castle of Baggotrath, intending to erect a work there and cut off the besieged from further reinforcement by sea. On 2 August Jones made a sudden sally, drove the besiegers out of Baggotrath, fell on Ormonde's camp at Rathmines, and took camp, artillery, baggage, and eighteen hundred prisoners. \"There never was any day in Ireland like this\", says Whitelocke, \"to the confusion of the Irish, and raising up the spirits of the English, and restoring their interest, which from their first footing in Ireland was never in so low a condition as at that time\". A few days later Ormonde wrote to Jones for a list of his prisoners. \"My Lord\", replied Jones, \"since I routed your army I cannot have the happiness to know where you are that I may wait upon you\". He tried to use his victory to recover Drogheda, but Ormonde was still strong enough to oblige him to raise the siege (8 August).\n\nOn 15 August Oliver Cromwell landed at Dublin, and as commander-in-chief superseded Jones. The latter became his second in command, with the rank of lieutenant-general. He took part in the capture of Wexford and the siege of Waterford, but the fatigues of the campaign proved fatal to him. On 19 December 1649 Cromwell announced his death to the speaker. \"The noble lieutenant-general, whose finger, to our knowledge, never ached in all these expeditions, fell sick; we doubt upon a cold taken upon our late wet march and ill accommodation; and went to Dungarvan, where, struggling some four or five days with a fever, he died, having run his course with so much honour, courage, and fidelity, as his actions better speak than my pen. What England lost hereby is above me to speak. I am sure I lost a noble friend and companion in labours\". Jones was buried in St. Mary's Church at Youghal, in the Earl of Cork's chapel.\n\nParliament had voted him lands to the value of £500 a year, after his victory at Dungan Hill, and after Rathmines they increased the gift to £1,000 a year. It is doubtful whether these votes were carried out, for on 5 December 1650 the house voted £300 to \"the Lady Dame Mary Culme, widow, late wife of Lieutenant-general Jones, for the relief of her present necessities\".\n\nA poem on Jones's victory at Rathmines was printed by George Wither.\n\n"}
{"id": "1939485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939485", "title": "Polish Armed Forces rank insignia", "text": "Polish Armed Forces rank insignia\n\nThis article presents the military ranks of the entire Polish Armed Forces as well as the rank insignia used today. The system of rank insignia is a direct descendant of various systems used throughout history by the Polish Army. Some of the grades trace their name back to the Middle Ages, for instance the rank of \"chorąży\" literally means a \"flag bearer\" or an Ensign.\n\nNames of Polish ranks are often of foreign origin, like the ones introduced by the 17th-century mercenaries serving for the Polish Crown. These include the rank of \"kapral\", which is a derivative of the Italian \"caporale\" - much like the English equivalent of corporal.\n\nAs the structure of Polish rank names substantially differs from the English one, it seems more appropriate to give the U.S. or U.K. equivalent ranks, based on the common NATO codes, rather than to provide a literal translation which can lead to numerous misinterpretations.\n\nMost rank titles are cognates to the ones in English, with some exceptions. Notably \"colonel's\" literal meaning is \"regimental-leader\", likewise \"plutonowy\" means \"platoon-leader\". Also, the title equivalent to petty officer is identical to the word for boatswain, so a \"Bosman\" may or may not be a \"bosman\".\n\nUntil World War II, each of the branches of the Land Forces used a set of different names for the same grades. For instance a sergeant was called \"sierżant\" in the infantry, \"ogniomistrz\" (literally \"master of fire\") in the artillery and \"wachmistrz\" (from German \"Wachtmeister\", or \"Master of the Guards\") in the cavalry. This is similar to the German army calling a cavalry officer which is equivalent to Hauptmann a Rittmeister\n\nModern Polish military practices were heavily influenced by Prussian/German and Russian traditions, as most founding officers after 1918 independence were veterans of those respective armies.\n\nThe Polish language requires the use of a prior honorific before stating the addressee's rank e.g. 'Panie Kapitanie...' (\"Mr Captain...\"). This is directly equivalent to French practice where the possessive \"Mon\" is pre-pended to the addressee's rank. During the communist period use of the formal 'Pan' (\"Sir\") was frowned upon and 'Obywatel' (\"Citizen\") (as in: \"Obywatelu Kapitanie!\") was used. This has reverted to prior style in the post-communist era.\n\nIt is customary to include other titles when referring to an officer in writing. This can lead to some interesting abbreviations. For example, a Lt. Col. in the airforce by the name Nowak who is a pilot and has an MSc in engineering would be written ppłk pil. mgr inż. Nowak (LtCol plt MEng Nowak).\n\nUniquely, Polish forces use a two-fingered version of the salute, and the saluting custom does not allow saluting with the fingers to the head without having headgear on (cap/beret or helmet).\n\nMarshal of Poland (Marszałek Polski) is the highest rank in the Polish Armed Forces. Note that unlike the remaining ranks, it does not belong to any particular service but to the armed forces as a whole. So far only six individuals have been promoted to this rank. With the death of the last surviving holder, Michał Rola-Żymierski in 1989 the rank of Marshal of Poland has been vacant.\n\nUntil 2004 the ranks of \"chorąży\" (OR-9 and OR-8) constituted a separate group, roughly corresponding to U.S. Warrant Officers. On July 1, 2004 the number of these ranks was reduced and they were included in the group of non-commissioned ranks.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2014 all reserve NCOs, holders of the rank of \"chorąży sztabowy / chorąży sztabowy marynarki\" and \"młodszy chorąży sztabowy / młodszy chorąży sztabowy marynarki\" were promoted to the rank of \"starszy chorąży sztabowy / starszy chorąży sztabowy marynarki\"; holders of the rank of \"starszy sierżant sztabowy / starszy bosman sztabowy\" and \"sierżant sztabowy / bosman sztabowy\" were promoted to the rank of \"młodszy chorąży / młodszy chorąży marynarki\"; and holders of the rank of \"starszy plutonowy / starszy bosmanmat\" were promoted to the rank of \"sierżant / bosman\".\n\nThus the ranks discontinued on July 1, 2004 were officially abolished in the Polish Armed Forces.\n\n\n\n"}

After a year, for the 1984–85 season he resumed his coaching career with two four-year stints with PEC Zwolle and FC Den Haag, where he would be sacked for the first time. He was then chosen to direct the youth side of Ajax, a position he would occupy for five seasons.\n\nWillem II followed in his career, and after ending his first season fifth place, achieved a second place and the title of best Dutch team of the year. This meant that Willem II, a team better known for finishing in the bottom half of the Dutch league, would be playing in the Champions League. The Champions was a bridge too far for Willem II, and the team ended up last in the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League group stage, and after failing to achieve a European spot, Adriaanse resigned on 20 May 2000.\n\nAdriaanse returned to Ajax as manager, but after a third place season he was released early in the next season, on 29 November 2001, after some poor results. During his tenure, he made a number of controversial statements to the press – he called the chairman of PSV a \"talking lampshade\", and most famously said of Marco van Basten (mooted to join the Ajax staff at the time), \"A good horse does not make a good rider.\"\n\nAfter beginning the 2002–03 season without a club, Adriaanse was signed to AZ in November 2002. A tenth-place finish in the first season was followed by a fifth-placed finish, which allowed the Alkmaar team to join the UEFA Cup in the 2004–05 season. There, the club upset Spanish side and top contenders Villarreal in the quarter-finals before being knocked out on away goals in the semi-finals by Sporting Clube de Portugal, in the final minute of extra time. In the Eredivisie, AZ also performed above expectations, finishing third after topping the league for a week at the end of the first half and spending most of the second in second place. Adriaanse again coined a number of colourful phrases while at AZ, the best known being \"Scoreboard journalism\", \"Cheese viewers\", \"Woonerf football\" and \"Evening footballer\".\n\nAfter much speculation and his stated desire to leave the club (he was succeeded by Louis van Gaal), on 24 May 2005 Adriaanse was presented as the new manager of Portuguese club Porto (replacing José Couceiro), and became the fourth manager to sign for the Portuguese side since the departure of José Mourinho. In the first season as Porto coach, he achieved the \"\"Dobradinha\"\" for the first time since the departure of Mourinho, winning the Primeira Liga and the Taça de Portugal.\n\nOn 9 August 2006, Adriaanse resigned as manager of Porto. Four months later, he became coach of Ukrainian club Metalurh Donetsk. On 17 May 2007, Adriaanse resigned as manager of Metalurh Donetsk with four games to play in the Ukrainian Premier League.\n\nOn 27 August 2007, Adriaanse signed a one-year deal with Al-Sadd and resigned as coach on 28 January 2008.\n\nOn 13 March 2008, Adriaanse signed a two-year deal with the Austrian champion Red Bull Salzburg and he left the club after the end of his contract on 30 June 2009.\n\nOn 12 January 2010, it was confirmed Adriaanse's appointment at the helm of the Qatar Olympic team. His Middle East stint, however, lasted only 14 months, as his contract was terminated by mutual consent in March 2011.\n\nOn 20 June 2011, Twente announced on their website to have appointed Adriaanse as new trainer in place of departing manager Michel Preud'homme. In his first official match with the club, Adriaanse won the Johan Cruyff Shield against former team Ajax. On 3 January 2012, Adriaanse, halfway through a one-season contract, was terminated by Twente.\n\nIn the 2014–15 season, Adriaanse acted as technical advisor at Utrecht. He also decided to leave the club at the end of the season when manager Rob Alflen announced his resignation.\n\nAdriaanse gained a lot of fame in the Netherlands after qualifying for the Champions League with the average Dutch club Willem II. It was even more impressive, because Willem II often played attacking football, a style Adriaanse has adopted throughout his managerial career.\n\nAdriaanse is famous for his controversial training approach. At Willem II, he once ordered his whole squad to follow him by car, while they drove 13 km away from their training ground. At a remote spot, all players had to give their car keys to Adriaanse. Then he drove back to town, while the squad had to run in front of his car. Back at the training ground, the players got their car keys back. Since their cars were still parked far from the training ground, however, they all had to walk back another 13 km. At AZ Alkmaar he once ordered the whole squad to search for Easter eggs during a training session. They looked for an hour until Co Adriaanse finally revealed there were no eggs hidden. Adriaanse already had these strange training methods at the start of his career, because when he was a youth trainer at Ajax, he sometimes ordered his players to lie on the ground. Then a teammate (with football boots on) would run over the bodies. Because of all these infamous incidents, Adriaanse is sometimes nicknamed \"Psycho Co\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1939489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939489", "title": "Darlington, Western Australia", "text": "Darlington, Western Australia\n\nDarlington, Western Australia, is a locality in the Shire of Mundaring on the Darling Scarp, dissected by Nyaania Creek and north of the Helena River.\n\nAbout one kilometre to the west of Darlington and lower on the Darling Scarp lies the locality of Boya. Between Darlington and Boya there are two abandoned quarries: C. Y. O'Connor's \"Fremantle Harbour Works Quarry\", now known as \"Hudman Road Amphitheatre\", and the Mountain Quarry which is also called Boya quarry. They are situated on the southern slope of Greenmount Hill which is defined by the Great Eastern Highway to the north, and the Helena River to the south. The boundary with Glen Forrest to the east has shifted a few times.\n\nDarlington is located upon the escarpment of the Darling Fault which trends north-south across the south-west of Western Australia, defining what is known as the Perth Hills.\n\nDarlington developed as a locality from the establishment of the Darlington Winery in the late nineteenth century. Unlike Glen Forrest and Greenmount, Darlington was unplanned. Darlington Hall was originally built for the winery.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1954, Darlington was served by the Mundaring Loop on the Eastern Railway, which bisected the town. Darlington was included in \"picnic\" and \"excursion\" train itineraries in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1966, the line was officially closed by act of parliament and the tracks removed. The Railway Reserves Heritage Trail, or \"bridle trail\" as it is known by locals, now occupies the former railway route, and has become a popular walking and bike trail.\n\nDarlington had extensive orchards during the early 20th century. Due to its cooler \"hills climate\", it also had a number of guest houses. D. H. Lawrence stayed in one for a short time during his visit to Australia. Guest houses were also used as convalescent homes during the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, significant numbers of artists had lived in or been associated with the small community. By the late 20th century, the break-up of farms and orchards, with the resulting subdivision of land, had contributed to an increase in the local population.\n\nIn the 2016 census, there were 3,656 people in Darlington. 65.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 14.0%. 90.3% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.9%, Anglican 19.3% and Catholic 13.9%.\n\nVery early on, because of its altitude and separation from the Swan Coastal Plain, Darlington became established as a popular picnic area, country drive destination, and a place for holiday homes.\n\nWriters, artists and others seeking to be separate from Perth's extensive suburban sand plain had sought the location for its natural surroundings. The artists gained the most publicity for their residence, while the writers and others tended to keep their privacy.\n\nSome of the community groups are over 40 years old. For example, the Darlington Residents and Ratepayers Association evolved from the earlier Darlington Progress Association, the Darlington Arts Festival as well. The tennis, cricket and other sports clubs have similar heritage.\n\nA newer arrival, the Darlington Club, is less than two years old and as a social club, is involved in sustaining community involvement and use of the Darlington Hall.\n\nIt is one of the few hills communities to be served by several primary schools—the Darlington Primary School (state school), Tree-Tops Montessori School, and Helena College.\n\nThe Darlington Arts Festival, an annual event, has been going for more than 40 years. It includes art exhibitions and other events on the Darlington oval.\n\nThe 2006 \"Trek the Trail\" event was organised on the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail and went from Mundaring to Darlington, and included events on the oval.\n\nThe Darlington Review is a monthly publication of some 50 years standing, featuring stories, news, advertisements and other material of local interest. It is one of the few of its kind to serve any hills community for such a long time and is delivered to each address in the locality.\n\nThe Mundaring shire council has publicised the locality by placing \"Locality of Darlington\" signs on its entrance roads at the administrative boundary.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939511", "title": "Huayna Potosí", "text": "Huayna Potosí\n\nHuayna Potosí is a mountain in Bolivia, located near El Alto and about 25 km north of La Paz in the Cordillera Real.\n\nHuayna Potosí is the closest high mountain to La Paz. Surrounded by high mountains, it is roughly 15 miles due north of the city, which makes this mountain the most popular climb in Bolivia. The normal ascent route is a fairly straightforward glacier climb, with some crevasses and a steep climb to the summit. However, the other side of the mountain -- Huayna Potosí West Face -- is the biggest face in Bolivia. Several difficult snow and ice routes ascend this 1000 meter high face.\n\nThe first ascent of the normal route was undertaken in 1919 by Germans Rudolf Dienst and Adolf Schulze. Some climbing books report this mountain as the \"easiest 6000er in the world\", but this claim is debatable. The easiest route entails an exposed ridge and sections of moderately steep ice, with a UIAA rating of PD. There are many 6000m mountains that are easier to climb in terms of technical difficulty. Perhaps therefore, the main reason Huayna Potosí has been referred to as the easiest 6000m climb is that the elevation gain from trailhead to summit is less than 1400 m; with easy access from La Paz. Since La Paz is at 3640 m, climbers have an easier time acclimatizing.\n\nIn 1877 a group of six German climbers tried to climb Huayna Potosí for the first time. Without proper equipment and with little practical information, they set off toward the unclimbed peak. Their unsuccessful attempt met with tragedy. Four climbers died at an altitude around 5600m; the remaining two managed to retreat in deteriorating conditions, but died by exhaustion just after finding their way to the Zongo Pass. 21 years later, on 9 September 1898, an expedition of Austrian climbers attempted the mountain ascension again but after five days spent at 5900m they were forced to descend. Finally, in 1919 the Germans R. Dienst and O. Lhose reached the south summit (marginally higher than the north summit) climbing the mountain on the east face on a route that later would become the current normal route, with some variants.\n\nThe normal route to climb Huayna Potosí is a straightforward climb on glacier. Following this route the mountain can be climbed in two daily stages. Climbers generally take a 4x4 up the valley on a gravel road from El Alto taking about two hours to reach a car park at 4700m, Zongo Pass(). Where a base camp is established. There is a recently established hut here. Staff are usually happy to book walk ins if they have rooms available, and a reduced price can be negotiated outside of the peak season.\n\nFrom the hut here it is a 1 - 3 h hike up to the high camp at 5200 m () on the snow line (Time taken depends greatly on acclimatization and fitness). This camp is called locally Campo Argentino and consists of a number of areas of leveled rocks suitable for pitching tents. As of 2006, there is a refuge at the high camp where it is possible to stay the night for around $10. Booking is preferable, and essential during peak season. Conditions are spartan, with all sleeping mattresses placed next to each other on the upper level in two rows.\n\nMost climbers begin their summit attempt between midnight and 3 AM. Fit and well acclimatized climbers rise and leave later, overtaking other groups during the climb, and can reach the summit in around 3–4 hours, but people frequently take twice that time. The route is usually very clearly visible between the penitentes, and follows the main glacier up directly (across the bergschrund and directly up a ridge) or along an arête on the right. Following that it curves behind the mountain when viewed from Zongo pass. The final approach is fairly exposed, either directly to the summit, or along the summit ridge. The summit is small and frequently has a pronounced cornice, reducing usable space.\n\nThe entire climb from the high camp take between 8 and 12 hours. Very acclimatised parties climb the mountain directly from the hut at Zongo Pass and in this case the whole climb takes the most of the day.\n\nMorning sunshine causes the snow to become less stable for walking, and increases avalanche risk from 8 am onwards. The views on a clear morning from the summit are unbelievable - the mountain is far higher than anything else anywhere nearby, and the Cordillera Real, Lake Titicaca, La Paz, and part of the Altiplano they reside on are all visible. Until early 2004 there was a guest book for summitting climbers to sign. Unfortunately this overhang collapsed in mid-2006 leaving the original metal container protruding out of the summit ridge hanging above the city of La Paz below.\n\nIn addition to the normal route, a large variety of routes (some of them very technical) to the two summits exist.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939516", "title": "Eastern Railway (Western Australia)", "text": "Eastern Railway (Western Australia)\n\nThe Eastern Railway is the main railway route between Fremantle and Northam in Western Australia. It opened in stages between 1881 and 1893. The line is continued east to Kalgoorlie as the Eastern Goldfields Railway.\n\nThe first sod of the Fremantle-Guildford Railway was turned by Governor Ord at Guildford on 3 June 1879. The event coincided with the celebration of the 50th anniversary of settlement of Western Australia. The alignment of the first section of the railway, from Fremantle to Guildford, has remained generally unchanged since it opened on 1 March 1881.\n\nThe centenary of the railway was celebrated on 1 March 1981.\n\"Source: West Australian Government Gazette of 1885, 5 January\"\n\nThe \"First Route\" was opened on 11 March 1884. The principal contractor of the works was J.W. Wright & Co. The route ascended the escarpment around Greenmount Hill passing through Boya, Darlington, Glen Forrest, Mundaring and Sawyers Valley before turning north to Mount Helena, originally known as White's Mill then as Lion Mill. A significant delay in construction was experienced at a site that became popularly known as Devil's Terror - a location between Darlington and Glen Forrest. Clay was struck when a cutting was under construction followed by a subsurface spring. The resulting flooding turned the clay into a bottomless bog. The rail alignment had to be moved 100 metres south along the bed of Nyaania Creek, which was diverted into a specially constructed channel.\n\n\"Source: West Australian Government Gazette of 1885, 5 January\"\n\nIt soon became apparent that this route was too steep for the increasingly heavier trains and engines required for the route. As a result, another route was quickly devised in the 1890s.\n\nAfter the completion of the Second Route, this line became known in Western Australian Government Railways records as the \"Smith's Mill Branch\", then the Mundaring Branch, and later as the \"Mundaring Loop\".\nPassenger traffic ceased between Boya and Mount Helena on 24 January 1954 and the route was closed from Koongamia to Mount Helena on 12 March 1965.\n\nThe current condition of the stations on this route today are as follows:\nThe Eastern Railway was then later extended beyond Northam to the Kalgoorlie goldfields. The line was known as the \"Eastern Goldfields Railway\".\n\nAlso known as the \"Parkerville deviation\", the \"Second Route\" via Swan View, John Forrest National Park, Hovea, Parkerville and Stoneville, through to Mount Helena, opened on 1 July 1896, little over a decade after the \"First Route\". Its grades were less demanding, and the line did not suffer from the more serious problems of the first route.\n\nThe line was originally only a single track, and featured Western Australia's first (and, until 1990, only) railway tunnel. As traffic increased the newer route was duplicated, with the second track bypassing the tunnel, resulting in a slightly longer journey for trains heading across the Darling Scarp. The \"Second Route\" closed on 13 February 1966.\n\nIn the 1940s, it became clear to the Western Australian Government Railways that the original Eastern Railway alignments were not suitable for future traffic and the loadings that were to be carried between the coast and the areas east of the Darling Scarp.\n\nAs part of the Federal Government's program to build a standard gauge line across Australia, and the passing of the \"Railways (Standard Gauge) Construction Act 1961\" work commenced on gauge converting the line to dual gauge with a new alignment further north through the Avon Valley built with easier grades.\n\nThe Third Route was originally built with timber sleepers and rail. It was later upgraded using heavy () continuously welded rail laid on new concrete sleepers during the late 1970s through into the early 1980s.\n\nIt is a dual gauge ( and narrow gauge) double line throughout its entirety, also including a few crossing loop sections, where there are three tracks. These loops are located at Jumperkine, Moondyne and Toodyay West. Numerous cuttings were also constructed, including the deep Windmill Hill Cutting east of Toodyay. A major marshalling yard is located five kilometres west of Northam.\n\nThis new route opened on 14 February 1966 and coincided with the closure of the earlier two routes of the Eastern Railway.\n\nThe original Eastern Railway alignments still survive today, in the form of a shared path used for cycling, horse riding and walking, see below re the built up are in the Mundaring area as the 'Rail Reserves Heritage Trail'. Further east and beyond that trail, is the Kep Trail, from Mundaring through to Northam.\n\nThe original section from Fremantle to Midland is still in use as part of Transperth's suburban network. Transwa's \"AvonLink\", \"MerredinLink\" and \"Prospector\" services from Perth to Northam, Merredin and Kalgoorlie use the line as does Great Southern Rail's \"Indian Pacific\" to Sydney. Other named trains to previously traverse the line were \"The Westland\", \"The Kalgoorlie\" and the \"Trans-Australian\".\n\nIntrastate and interstate freight services are operated by Aurizon, Mineral Resources, Pacific National and SCT Logistics. CBH Group operate grain trains.\n\nThe Railway Reserves Heritage Trail is the result of the Mundaring Shire Council being allocated funds from a number of external authorities to maintain and improve the old railway alignment as a walking trail. Between 2004–2006, the trail has had considerable signage and track maintenance conducted along the trail.\n\nIt is also used for the annual \"Trek the Trail\" event conducted in conjunction between Mundaring and Hills Historical Society, the Mundaring Shire Council and the Mundaring Visitor Centre. The event was conducted between Wooroloo and Chidlow in 2004,and Mount Helena and Parkerville in 2005, in 2006 event was between Mundaring and Darlington.\n\n"}

His chief claim to fame is that he is enumerated as one of the Thirty Tyrants who supposedly tried to overthrow the emperor Gallienus.\n\nCyriades is listed first in the catalogue of usurpers that comprise the chapter on the Thirty Tyrants within the notoriously unreliable \"Historia Augusta\" (and writing under the fictitious name of Trebellius Pollio), whose narrative is brief, indistinct, and largely inaccurate. According to this source, Cyriades was the son of a rich man, also named Cyriades, and whose debauched lifestyle offended his father. After stealing from his father, he fled to the Persians, stimulated Shapur I to invade the eastern Roman provinces and helped in the capture of Antioch and Caesarea. At this point he assumed the purple together with the title of Augustus, possibly killing his father before being slain by his own followers after a short, cruel and crime filled reign.\n\nThe \"Historia Augusta\" dates this as occurring when the emperor Valerian was on his way to the east to fight the Persians, so the traditional assumption is that the date of this rebellion was 259. Edward Gibbon instead dated the usurpation as occurring after the defeat and capture of Valerian in 260.\n\nThe events of the Persian invasion of the east are also mentioned by other sources, but they attribute the fall of Antioch to the intrigues of an individual named Mareades or Mariades or Mariadnes, none of whom claimed the imperial dignity.\n\nAmmianus Marcellinus mentioned that during the attack on Antioch during the reign of Gallienus, \"Mareades, who had inconsiderately brought the Persians there to the destruction of his own people, was burned alive.\" Outside of the reference to Gallienus' reign, Ammianus Marcellinus does not date this event, but some scholars date this to 256.\n\nThe \"Anonymous Continuator of Cassius Dio\" refers to a Mariadnes, and describes the same event, but with some variations. Firstly, the people of Antioch were aware of the upcoming invasion, and that a large part of the population of Antioch remained in the city, being well-disposed toward Mariadnes and also favouring a change from the Romans to the Persians. Since this part of the work immediately precedes a section on the approaching formal recognition of Aemilianus as Augustus in 253, its author set the event described therein in the early 250s. This date, and the fall of Antioch occurring during the reign of Trebonianus Gallus, is favoured by a number of modern scholars.\n\nFinally, according to John Malalas, during Valerian's reign, Mariades, one of the officials of Antioch, was expelled from the city council on charges of embezzlement. He was responsible for the running of the chariot races, had not bought the horses for one of the factions, and had stolen money that had been set aside for the Hippodrome. As a result, he fled to Persia, and in an interview with Shapur I, agreed to betray Antioch to the Persians. After the capture of the city, which was plundered and burnt to the ground, Shapur had Mariades beheaded as he was a traitor to his own people. Although John Malalas dates this event to 265/6, his narrative also implies that it occurred around 252/3.\n\nIt is now accepted that Cyriades and Mariades are one and the same person. One possibility is that the name Cyriades is a Hellenized version of the Aramaic name Maryad'a (\"My Lord Knows\"), with CYRI the Latin transliteration of the Greek KYPI (\"Lord\"). This may give rise to the claim made in the \"Historia Augusta\" that Cyriades was firstly made Caesar and then Augustus, as KYPI could be used for the holder of either title.\n\nThere is no numismatic and epigraphic evidence that Cyriades (or Mariades) was ever proclaimed Augustus. The coins published by Groltzius and Mediobarbus are rejected by Numismatics as unquestionably spurious.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1939531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939531", "title": "Jinsei Shinzaki", "text": "Jinsei Shinzaki\n\nKensuke Shinzaki (新崎 健介 \"Shinzaki Kensuke\", born December 2, 1966) is a Japanese professional wrestler and professional wrestling executive, better known by his ring name, Jinsei Shinzaki (新崎 人生 \"Shinzaki Jinsei\"). He is currently signed to Michinoku Pro Wrestling promotion as the executive president of the promotion as well as being the sole heavyweight wrestler on the roster. Shinzaki is also known for his appearances with other Japanese promotions such as All Japan Pro Wrestling, New Japan Pro-Wrestling and Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling and in the United States with the World Wrestling Federation from 1994 to 1996 under the ring name Hakushi.\n\nA former soccer player, Shinzaki trained in amateur wrestling in high school. He firstly started working a career as an actor, but he left for professional wrestling when he met Gran Hamada. Shinzaki trained in the Mexican style of lucha libre before debuting in Hamada's promotion Universal Lucha Libre in 1992, wrestling under a mask and the name of Mongolian Yuga.\n\nIn 1993, Shinzaki followed The Great Sasuke to his promotion Michinoku Pro Wrestling, becoming one of its founders. In June 1993, Kensuke unmasked and changed his gimmick, re-debuting as Jinsei Shinzaki (\"Jinsei\" meaning \"life\" in Japanese), an \"aruki henro\" or Shikoku pilgrim. Under this persona, Shinzaki wrestled in a slow, meditated style, and constantly performed prayers in the ring before every movement. He also came to the arenas in full pilgrimage garments, including white robes and \"suge-kasa\" hats, and carried a \"shakujo\" staff and a \"kongo-zue\". Jinsei debuted as a silent heel, being introduced by Mr. Yamaguchi as a special member of Super Delfín's heel unit in order to \"curse\" The Great Sasuke with his prayers. However, after disagreements with them, Shinzaki turned face in 1994 and joined Sasuke and his allies.\n\nIn mid-1994, Shinzaki wrestled on a World Wrestling Federation tour of Japan. This led to him being offered a contract with the promotion later that year after the promotion was looking for a Japanese wrestler on the roster and Hayabusa had rejected the offer to work for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling and Shinzaki was given the Japanese wrestler spot on the offer.\n\nIn late 1994, Shinzaki traveled to the United States to wrestle for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He wrestled as Hakushi (\"White One\"), a derivation of his Michinoku Pro Wrestling persona. This new character resembled Jinsei Shinzaki, but he was characterized by sporting Buddhist shakyo written all over his skin, in a reference to Japanese folk character Hoichi the Earless. He was also accompanied by a facepaint-wearing cultist named Shinja. Initially a heel, his first few matches were highlighted by victories over jobbers which included future star Matt Hardy and midcarders like Aldo Montoya, and 1-2-3 Kid. Hakushi brought the wrestling style of \"lucharesu\" to the company, utilizing many aerial maneuvers, and stood out for using many of them to finish his matches as opposed to a single, established finishing move.\n\nHakushi had a brief alliance with ninja wrestler Kwang, calling themselves collectively \"Shogun\". After losing a tag team match, Hakushi blamed Kwang and turned on him. Hakushi subsequently defeated Kwang, in the Shogun team’s breakup and blow-off match. This also happened to be the Kwang’s last appearance. Hakushi then feuded with former WWF Champion Bret Hart, wrestling a number of competitive matches against him. He also participated in a three-way feud with perennial jobber Barry Horowitz and Bodydonna Skip. Horowitz, who lost for years on WWF programming to get over new talent, surprisingly used his three-quarter nelson to secure a victory over Skip. Hakushi would also fall to Horowitz soon after because of interference from Skip. His loss was a surprise to the fans, not only given Horowitz's long time losing record, but also given how well Hakushi did during his feud with Bret Hart in what had been Hakushi's first major feud in the company. Hakushi and Horowitz would briefly form a tag team, leading to a face turn for Hakushi. In Survivor Series, Hakushi was a member of The Underdogs team, but was eliminated after a kick from his enemy 1-2-3 Kid. He also was a competitor in the 1996 Royal Rumble, where he was eliminated by Bret Hart's brother, Owen Hart.\n\nDuring a match on \"Raw\" against Justin \"Hawk\" Bradshaw on the March 6 episode, Hakushi was hit by Bradshaw's branding iron after a loss. That week on \"WWF Superstars\", commentator Jim Ross reported that he had been so humiliated by the branding that he (kayfabe) left the WWF.\n\nUpon leaving his stint in WWF, Shinzaki returned to Japan. He made a single night appearance with New Japan Pro Wrestling at \"Battle Formation\" on April 29, 1996, where he wrestled The Great Muta. Shinzaki was introduced as a mystic, supernatural character very much like Muta, who embodied evil while Shinzaki embodied good. Shinzaki was defeated in a spirited brawl. One year later on January 4's \"Wrestling World In Tokyo Dome 1997\", he faced and defeated Heisei Ishingun member Michiyoshi Ohara, who had a similar gimmick to his, and mimicked everything Shinzaki did.\n\nShinzaki returned to Michinoku Pro Wrestling in October 1996 at the Michinoku Pro 3rd Anniversary event, defeating Hayabusa. Once again aligning himself with The Great Sasuke, Shinzaki was undefeated in singles matches until 1997.\n\nIn October 1997, the Hakushi character was brought up to go against WWF's \"Dead Man\" The Undertaker. Hakushi was now an undead as well due to having been \"killed\" in his match with Muta, and was introduced in a coffin by an entourage of Japanese traditional pallbearers, showing in his clothes the same blood stains he had got in said match. He faced Undertaker, but was defeated after a Tombstone Piledriver and entombed in the mountains of Tohoku.\n\nIn mid-1997, Shinzaki started appearing in Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling helping Hayabusa in his battles against Mr. Gannosuke. They also had a brief stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling competing against Rob Van Dam and Sabu.\n\nShinzaki and Hayabusa competed in All Japan Pro Wrestling's Real Tag League 1998. In January 1999, they won the All Asia Tag Team Championship from Jun Izumida and Tamon Honda. They retained it until June 1999, when they lost it to Takao Omori and Yoshihiro Takayama. Shinzaki then kept a feud against Mitsuharu Misawa's Untouchables faction, but his appearances in AJPW became more sparse until ceasing in favour of Michinoku Pro in 2002.\n\nIn 2001, still as an AJPW representative, Shinzaki made a surprise appearance in New Japan Pro Wrestling, wearing a white mask and causing Kazunari Murakami's defeat to Keiji Mutoh. Jinsei then unmasked, and Mutoh introduced him as the new member of his personal faction Bad Ass Translate Trading.\n\nShinzaki has been the president of Michinoku Pro Wrestling company since 2003 as a result of Sasuke dedicating more of his time to his political career as a member of the Iwate Prefectural (state) Assembly.\n\nShinzaki is also the co-founder of the \"joshi\" promotion Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling along with \"joshi\" wrestler Meiko Satomura.\n\nOn April 15, 2011, Shinzaki returned to the United States to wrestle for Chikara in the 2011 King of Trios tournament, where he would represent Michinoku Pro with Dick Togo and the Great Sasuke. In their first round match Team Michinoku Pro defeated Team Minnesota (1-2-3 Kid, Arik Cannon and Darin Corbin). The following day, Team Michinoku Pro defeated Jigsaw, Manami Toyota and Mike Quackenbush to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On April 17, Team Michinoku Pro was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinal stage by F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Johnny Gargano).\n\nFollowing the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Shinzaki helped victims in the Tōhoku region by travelling around and providing them with food and drinks. Initial reports falsely noted that Shinzaki himself was living in his car due to losing his home and restaurant. However, this was incorrect as he was really just spending a lot of time traveling to help the needy.\n\n\n"}

At the 2016 Census, there were 1,106,585 Canadians who claimed full or partial Polish heritage.\n\nThe first Polish immigrant on record, was Dominik Barcz, came to Canada in 1752. He was a fur merchant from Gdańsk who settled in Montreal. He was followed in 1757 by Charles Blaskowicz, a deputy surveyor-general of lands. In 1776 arrived army surgeon, August Franz Globensky. His grandson, Charles Auguste Maximilien Globensky, was elected to the House of Commons in Ottawa in 1875.\n\nAmong the earliest Polish immigrants to Canada were members of the Watt and De Meuron military regiments from Saxony and Switzerland sent overseas to help the British Army in North America. Several were émigrés who took part in the November Uprising of 1830 and the 1863 insurrection against the Russian Empire in the Russian sector of partitioned Poland.\n\nIn 1841, Casimir Stanislaus Gzowski arrived in Canada from partitioned Poland via the US, and for 50 years worked in the engineering, military and community sectors in Toronto and Southern Ontario, for which he was knighted by Queen Victoria. His great-grandson, Peter Gzowski, became one of Canada's famous radio personalities.\n\nCharles Horecki immigrated in 1872. He was an engineer with the cross-Canada railway construction from Edmonton to the Pacific Ocean through the Peace River Valley. Today, a mountain and a body of water in British Columbia are named after him.\n\nPolish immigration stopped during World War I and between the wars, over 100,000 Polish immigrants arrived in Canada.\n\nThe first significant group of Polish group-settlers were ethnic Kashubians from northern Poland, who were escaping Prussian and German oppression resulting from the occupation after the partitions. They arrived in Renfrew County of Ontario in 1858, where they founded the settlements of Wilno, Barry's Bay, and Round Lake. By 1890 there were about 270 Kashubian families working in the Madawaska Valley of Renfrew County, mostly in the lumber industry of the Ottawa Valley\n\nThe consecutive waves of Polish immigrants in periods from 1890–1914, 1920–1939, and 1941 to this day, settled across Canada from Cape Breton to Vancouver, and made numerous and significant contributions to the agricultural, manufacturing, engineering, teaching, publishing, religious, mining, cultural, professional, sports, military, research, business, governmental and political life in Canada.\n\nAll Polish Canadians including their descendants are encouraged by organizations such as the Congress, to preserve their background and retain some ties with Poland and its people. In the past, the most significant role in the preservation of various aspects of Polish traditions and customs among the Polish communities in Canada fell for the Polish urban parishes, which retain the use of Polish language during services.\n\nThe first Polish Catholic priest visited Polish immigrants in 1862 in Kitchener. The first church serving Polish immigrants was built in 1875 in Wilno, Ontario. In Winnipeg, the Holy Ghost Church was built in 1899 with the church in Winnipeg publishing the first Polish newspaper in Canada, \"Gazeta Katolicka\" in 1908. In Sydney, Nova Scotia, St. Mary's Polish Parish was established in 1913 by immigrant steelworkers and coal miners, many of whom had previously formed the St. Michael's Polish Benefit Society (est. 1909). The parish remains the only Polish parish in Atlantic Canada, although there is a Polish mission (St. Faustina) in Halifax.\n\nThe first Polish-Canadian Roman Catholic bishop is Reverend Mathew Ustrzycki, consecrated in June 1985, auxiliary bishop of the Hamilton Diocese. There are Polish-Canadian priests in many congregations and orders, such as the Franciscans, Jesuits, Redemptorists, Saletinians, Resurrectionists, Oblates, Michaelites, and the Society of Christ. In addition, 80 priests serve in 120 parishes.\n\nNumerous Polish-Canadians have been recognized with awards and appointments by the Queen and the Canadian governments as well as universities and various organizations. One of the most notable recipients was Andrew Mynarski, pilot-gunner from Winnipeg, awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously for extreme valor in World War II.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939537", "title": "Dutch Canadians", "text": "Dutch Canadians\n\nDutch Canadians are any Canadian citizens of Dutch ancestry. According to the Canada 2006 Census, there were 1,035,965 Canadians of Dutch descent, including those of full or partial ancestry. This increased to 1,111,655 in 2016.\n\nThe first Dutch people to come to Canada were Dutch Americans among the United Empire Loyalists. The largest wave was in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century when large numbers of Dutch helped settle the Canadian west. During this period significant numbers also settled in major cities like Toronto. While interrupted by the First World War this migration returned in the 1920s, but again halted during the Great Depression and Second World War. After World War II a large number of Dutch immigrants moved to Canada, including a number of war brides of the Canadian soldiers who liberated the Netherlands. There were officially 1,886 Dutch war brides to Canada, ranking second after British war brides. During the war Canada had sheltered Crown Princess Juliana and her family. The annual Canadian Tulip Festival held in May commemorates her with a generous number of tulips coming from The Netherlands. Due to these close links Canada became a popular destination for Dutch immigrants. The Canadian government encouraged this, recruiting skilled workers. This post-war wave went mainly to urban centres such as Toronto, Ottawa, and Vancouver. With the economic recovery of the Netherlands in the post-war years immigration to Canada slowed.\n\nWhile one of the largest minority groups in Canada, Dutch Canadians have tended to rapidly assimilate and there are relatively few Dutch Canadian organizations and media. One important institution is the Christian Reformed Church in North America, with most congregations found throughout Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario. The Institute for Christian Studies in Toronto, The King's University in Edmonton, and Redeemer University College in Ancaster, Ontario are associated with this Dutch Reformed/Calvinist denomination. Christian Schools International, the Christian Labour Association of Canada, and the Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario are organizations with strong Dutch-Canadian roots.\n\nDutch Canadians, because of their shared cultural and religious heritage, tend to form tight-knit communities. This has led to an in-joke known as \"Dutch bingo\", where it is said that a Dutch Canadian is able to figure out his/her connection to another Dutch Canadian by asking questions about the other's last name, town of birth, church and the college they attended.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The nearest settlement, north of the cape, is Augusta. South-east of Cape Leeuwin, the coast of Western Australia goes much further south. Located on headland of the cape is the Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse and the buildings that were used by the lighthouse keepers.\n\nIn Australia, the Cape is considered the point where the Indian Ocean meets the Southern Ocean; however most other nations and bodies consider the Southern Ocean to only exist south of 60°S.. It should also be noted that Cape Leeuwin is not the southernmost point of Western Australia, with that distinction belonging to West Cape Howe, further to the southeast near Albany.\n\nCape Leeuwin is often grouped with the next headland north, Cape Naturaliste, to identify the geography and ecology of the region. One example is in the name \"Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park\". Another is in the use of the phrases \"Cape to Cape\" or \"the Capes\" in tourist promotional materials. A shore base and a ship of the Royal Australian Navy have been named after the cape.\n\nThe Wardandi Aboriginals were the first peoples in the area. They called it \"Doogalup\".\n\nThe English navigator Matthew Flinders named Cape Leeuwin after the first known ship to have visited the area, the (\"Lioness\"), a Dutch vessel that charted some of the nearby coastline in 1622. The log of the \"Leeuwin\" has been lost, so very little is known of the voyage. However, the land found by the \"Leeuwin\" was recorded on a 1627 map by Hessel Gerritsz: Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht (\"Chart of the Land of Eendracht\"), which appears to show the coast between present-day Hamelin Bay and Point D’Entrecasteaux. Cape Leeuwin itself cannot be recognised.\n\nOther European vessels passed by for the next two centuries, including the Dutch , commanded by François Thijssen, in 1627 and the French \"Gros Venture\", under Louis Aleno de St Aloüarn, in 1772.\n\nThe first known European sighting of the cape was by Bruni d'Entrecasteaux in 1791. d'Entrecasteaux thought the cape was an island, and named it \"Isle St Allouarn\" (\"St Allouarn Island\"), in honour of Captain de St Aloüarn. Ten years later, Matthew Flinders began his survey of the South coast of New Holland from Cape Leeuwin in 1801 when he named it. Flinders landed in the bay to the east of Cape Leeuwin, today's Flinders Bay. Flinders was aware that the area had been known to the Dutch as \"Leeuwin's Land\".\n\nThe St Alouarn Islands is a group of islands off the tip of Cape Leeuwin.\n\nThe hillside to the west of the lighthouse, and the land nearby is now part of Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park. It has extensive heath vegetation and thick scrub which supports a very high number of plant species and also bird species that utilise this habitat. The bay just east of Cape Leeuwin is Flinders Bay, named after Matthew Flinders, the circumnavigating explorer of the early 19th century.\n\nShipwrecks within sight of this location include , an iron-screw steamer built in Belfast in Northern Ireland, which sank after hitting an uncharted rock on a clear calm day in 1910.\n\nThe wreck was found by Tom Snider in 1957 at 34°25.33′S 115°08.24′E. He dived on the wreck to recover the lead that was being carried by the ship.\n\nSome shipwrecks are identified as being within the vicinity of Augusta, Cape Leeuwin or Hamelin Bay that might not be within visual distance of the lighthouse.\n\n\n"}

He received his doctorate in 1903 and completed his \"Habilitation\" (attainment of professor's status) eight years later. His habilitation work about \"Shakespeare and the German spirit\" (\"Shakespeare und der deutsche Geist\", 1911), marked a turning point in German language and literature studies.\n\nHe also was an important member of the \"Georgekreis\", which he joined in 1899. He published first poems in Stefan George's periodical, the \"Blätter für die Kunst\". During 1910 and 1911, he edited the \"Jahrbuch für die geistige Bewegung\" (\"Yearbook for the Spiritual Movement\"), which preached the cultural political opinions of the \"Georgekreis\". Gundolf and Stefan George stayed on good terms for more than twenty years, but later, George broke completely with him, on the occasion of Gundolf's marriage in 1926.\n\nIn his works in literary studies, Gundolf took a new, historically-oriented view on literature, which centered on the philosophically determined registration of the poet. To him, the great writers (such as Shakespeare and Goethe) were symbolic figures of their time, and in his academic research he sought to present not only the artists themselves, but also the effects of their works.\n\nFrom 1916 to the late 1920s, Friedrich Gundolf was professor at Heidelberg University. In 1921, one of his students was Joseph Goebbels, later the Nazi propaganda minister, who at that time admired Gundolf and his colleague Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Von Waldberg subsequently became Goebbels's advisor when he wrote his doctoral dissertation. Gundolf also befriended the economist and fellow Heidelberg professor Arthur Salz.\n\nIn 1927, Gundolf was diagnosed with cancer, and died of it four years later. Gundolf's works were banned by the Nazis in 1933. He had married Agathe Mallachow (1884-1983) who was a pianist. Their daughter who became an Italian language professor and expert in literature, Cordelia Gundolf, was the godchild of graphic artist, Melchior Lechter. After the death of her father and as Hitler assumed power in Germany, her mother asked Albert Einstein for advice. This led the family to escape to Capri and subsequently to Rome.\n\nHis best known publication is \"Goethe\" (1916) (13th edition in 1930), in which he radicalized the principles of his view on figures. In 1964 the Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung founded the annual \"Friedrich-Gundolf-Preis\" for the intermediation of German culture in foreign countries.\n\n\n"}

He then set her house on fire in an attempt to conceal his crime.\nJohnson sought a reprieve, asserting that he wanted to donate a portion of his liver to his ailing sister, 48-year-old Deborah Otis, who was suffering from non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver and was in need of a transplant. His reprieve was denied because most doctors believe that it is unethical to harvest organs after death by lethal injection, and because Johnson was not a suitable donor himself. Another possibility – though not in Indiana, where all organ recipients (except kidney recipients) are chosen by state law according to their places on a waiting list, on which list Johnson's sister herself did not appear – would have been a living partial organ donation prior to execution. The case for delaying execution probably was not helped by the fact that Johnson was infected with Hepatitis B himself, and that his liver was too large to be suitable for his sister. Patients in Indiana generally receive a liver after at least twenty days on a waiting list.\nIn a statement before his death, Johnson criticized the Parole Board for refusing his request.\n\n"}

The community exists in major cities including the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton, Ottawa, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Windsor, Montreal and Waterloo Region.\n\nPopular events celebrated in the Croatian-Canadian community include the Canadian-Croatian Folklore Festival (held in eastern and western Canada) and the Croatian-North American Soccer Tournament.\n\nThere were approximately 114,880 Canadians of Croatian ethnic origin as reported in the 2011 Census compiled by Statistics Canada, rising to 133,965 by the 2016 Census. Although predominantly found in Ontario, Croatian Canadians are present in most major Canadian cities throughout the country. The ten largest Croatian communities are found in the following cities:\n\n\nThe town with the largest percentage of people of Croatian ethnic origin is Kenaston, Saskatchewan - 17.5% of its 285 inhabitants claim Croatian ethnic origin.\nStatistics Canada also designates Census Metropolitan Areas in the collection of its data. The ten Census Metropolitan Areas with the highest concentration of Croatian Canadians are:\n\n\nMost Croatian Canadians are Roman Catholic who follow the Latin Rite of their ancestors in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is in line with the population in Croatia, which is also majority Catholic. A very small minority of Croatians are Byzantine Rite Roman Catholics. There is also a very small community of Croats who follow Islam, the descendants of those who converted after the 16th century, after the conquest of much of Croatia by the Ottomans. Communities of Protestants have historically been negligible in Croatia.\n\nIn Canada, the first ethnic Croatian parish was established in Windsor in 1950. Soon, parishes were established in Toronto (1951), Hamilton (1958), Vancouver (1967), Winnipeg (1969). Today there are ethnic Croatian parishes and missions in seventeen cities in Canada. One of the most prominent Croatian Catholic parishes is the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Norval, Ontario. The establishment of the parish began in 1976 when community members, under the guidance of the Franciscan Friars, gathered for one evening to discuss the necessity and logistics of creating a place of gathering and cultural and faith building and preservation for the large Croatian immigrant population. In May 1977, 160 acres of property were purchased by the organizing committee with the specific dedication to Croatian Catholics. In the Norval Croatian Centre, as is in many other Croatian Catholic parishes, brochures, books, CDs and other forms of Croatian media are offered. \n\nThe Croatian Catholic youth in particular have started and taken part in many faith developments of their own. The Croatian Catholic Youth Group (CCY) is a faith-based group that comes together by schedule to discuss Catholic subjects and strengthen their religious belief. In addition, Mladifest is an annual event started in 2013 by the Queen of Peace Parish and has each year attracted hundreds of young Catholic Croatian to further explore the intersection of their faith and culture. As the event continued to develop over the years, the rotation of it between host parishes started, with the 2013, 2014, and 2015 Mladifest being in Norval, 2016 in Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 2017 in Immaculate Heart of Mary, Vancouver, British Columbia, 2018 in Croatian Martys Church, Mississauga, Ontario, and 2019 in Saint Nicholas Tavelic, Montreal, Quebec. It is an event funded by each parishes' members donations and contributions to bake sales, banquets and other events held to amass funds.\n\nPreviously unorganized Croats of the Muslim faith, with the arrival of eminent physician Asaf Duraković founded the Croatian Islamic Centre on June 23, 1973 in Etobicoke (75 Birmingham Street, Etobicoke, ON M8V 2C3), helped by the Croatian Catholic community. An old Catholic school was bought for 75,000 CAD and readjusted into masjid. There was also a community of Bosnian Muslims of Yugoslav option, but the Croat option of Bosnian Muslims never cooperated with them, since Muslim Croats considered Yugoslavs and Communists as chetniks and as their worst enemies due to violence and historical oppression. Since the old building was in bad condition, a new mosque was built on the site of the old one in 1983. \n\nToday, given changing political affiliations and political pressures from 1990's, and influx of non-Croat option of Bosnian Muslims, the center is now known as the Bosnian Islamic Centre. Despite that, today 4 out of 64 Canadian mosques have the attribute \"Croatian\". In Croatian Islamic Centre the children are taught the Croatian and Arabic languages, but there also Croatian Islamic newspapers, books, brochures, etc. Croatian Islamic Center called on Muslim governments, organisations, and individuals to press the Yugoslav regime, to end the persecution of Islam and to grant genuin equality of Muslims in Yugoslavia. The director of Centre Kerim Reis wanted that Belgrade releases the Muslim prisoners of conscience and to end to restrictions on the building of mosques. During Yugoslavia, this group often spoke accused Tito's Yugoslavia for practising discrimination both Muslim and Catholic Croats.\n\nWhile an overwhelming percentage of Croatians in Canada remain Roman Catholic, there are non-Catholic populations, including Protestants (most of whom have been in Canada for more than one generation) and Eastern Orthodox (the majority of whom are of mixed ethnic background).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the 2016 Census, there are 348,085 Canadians of Hungarian ancestry. The Hungarian minority is the 24th largest ethnic group of Canada. The bulk of Hungarian immigration occurred after World War II, with the wave peaking after the 1956 Hungarian revolution against communist rule, when over 100,000 Hungarian refugees went to Canada. The Hungarian Canadian community is among the country's multiple ethnicities; Canada is one of the top five countries of the Hungarian diaspora.\n\nAs of the 2016 Census 56,270 people (1.41% of the population) in Alberta have Hungarian roots, of which 7,660 have some knowledge of the language.\nThe first Hungarians arrived in Alberta in 1866 with Paul Oskar Eszterhazy, who wanted Hungarians that had earlier settled in Pennsylvania to re-settle in the province. The memorial of János Mráz, in 1895 in Bashaw indicated that there were already 25 Hungarian families, each of which farmed a homestead. The 1900 Census counted 167 Hungarians in the Lethbridge area.\n\nA larger influx of immigrants into Alberta was recorded in 1914-1915. At that time 300 Hungarian labourers arrived in the area. In the 1930s there was a greater immigration wave to Alberta. In 1921, there were 1,045 Hungarians living in the province, and by 1931 this number had grown to 5,502.\n\nThe 2016 Census showed 27,880 people living in Saskatchewan who have Hungarian roots or were born in Hungary. In local, spoken Hungarian the name of the province is \"Saskanada\".\n\nIn 1921 the Hungarian population was 8,946. By 1931 it had grown to 13,363, and by 1941 to 14,576. Because of interprovincial migration to Ontario and eastern Canada, the population declined to 12,470 by 1951. In 2001 there were 24,340 people of Hungarian ancestry living in Saskatchewan, of whom 24% (5,875 people) claimed to be born in Hungary.\n\nSignificant Hungarian populations exist in the Saskatchewan settlements of St. Benedict, Prud'homme, Yellow Creek, Zichydorf, East Central, Cudworth, Whitewood and Mistatim.\n\nIn 1885 Hungarian immigrants established several settlements in the eastern region of Saskatchewan. One of them was Esterhaz colony, which still exists. In 1888 a new settlement was founded near Esterhazy, which was named \"Kaposvár\" (named after Kaposvár, now part of Esterhazy). By 1902 these two settlements had over 900 people. The nearby Stockholm also became Hungarian settlement (in Hungarian \"Sokhalom\"). In 1894 a Hungarian settlement was established Rev. Janos (John) Kovacs in Otthon (which means 'Home'). After 1902 somewhere the current town of Kipling there was a settlement called \"Békevár\" ('Peaceburgh'). Later Hungarians settled down also in the northern part of Saskatchewan, close to Wakaw, there was the \"Buda School District\". West of Wakaw was the \"Dunafoldvar district\" (named after Dunaföldvár), south of Wakaw was \"Matyasfold\" (Mátyásföld - 'Land of Matthew').\n\nAfter the 2016 Census there were 10,120 people in Manitoba that have Hungarian ancestry or were born in Hungary. In 1996 there were 9,025 Hungarians living in Manitoba.\n\nThe first wave of the Hungarian immigrants reached Manitoba in 1885, many of whom settled in or near Winnipeg. In 1906 the Hungarian Presbyterian church was established there. The first Hungarian newspaper in Canada \"Kanadai Magyarság\" ('Canadian Hungarians') was published in Winnipeg in 1905. During the First World War, citizens of enemy allies were interned. Between 1918 and 1924 the Hungarian clubs in Winnipeg were very active. By 1920 there were 13,181 Hungarians in the country, most in Saskatchewan, with Manitoba only home to a small number. The second wave of immigration came during the inter-war years. The new immigrants established a Roman Catholic church and a Protestant church in 1924. A new newspaper was founded, \"Kanadai Magyar Újság\" ('Canadian Hungarian Newspaper'). In 1927 the Hungarian consulate was opened in Winnipeg.\n\nAs of 2016 Census, Ontario had 163,500 people that have Hungarian ancestry or were born in Hungary, accounting for 1.23% of the population. 54,240 Hungarians live in Toronto.\n\nMost Hungarians lived in Welland, Windsor, Brantford and in Hamilton. In 1931, more than 1,000 Hungarians lived in Hamilton, Toronto and in Welland. There were significant Hungarian populations in Brantford, Kitchener, Oshawa, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and in Port Colborne. Many Hungarians worked at the construction of the Welland Canal. By 1961 Hungarians accounted for 40% of the population of Welland.\n\nAfter the First World War thousands of Hungarians emigrated to Canada, especially from the rural classes. After the Second World War people from several classes came to the country. Ontario's climate was similar in some ways to the Hungarian climate so people from the Great Hungarian Plain moved to Ontario. The first Hungarians (60 people) to arrive in Welland did so in 1906. The first Hungarian society was established in Hamilton in 1907, the second was founded in Hamilton in 1913. In 1921 the Hungarian Self Culture Society was established in Welland where the first Hungarian newspaper was also published in 1928. In 1931 three quarters of the Hungarian Canadian population lived in Ontario. In 1933 two Hungarian newspapers were established by John Rapai, the \"Kanadai Magyar Újság\" and the \"Wellandi Kisújság\".. In 1949 a so-called \"Delhi & Tobacco District Hungarian House\" was dedicated in Delhi-Tillsonburg, which had been initiated by Rapai two years earlier. 40 percent (about 1,500 people) of the tobacco factory was Hungarian. After 1956 about 6,000 refugees arrived in Ontario. In 1964 a Roman Catholic church was built in London, Ontario. Roman Catholic churches are still in Toronto, Hamilton and in Courtland. There are still four Greek Catholic churches in Ontario: in Welland, Courtland, Windsor and in Hamilton. Presbyterian churches are in Delhi and in Ottawa.\n\n1956-1957 saw a large wave of Hungarian migration to Prince Edward Island, and probably the largest ever. A special Emergency Relief Committee was established to manage the arrival of Hungarian refugees, led by Minister of Health M.L. Bonnell. In addition to a reception centre which was established in the neighbourhood of Falconwood, in Charlottetown, a number of other groups participated in supporting the settlement of the Hungarians including the province's Red Cross, Women's Institute, Catholic Women's League, as well local volunteer doctors and nurses.\n\nIn general, the Hungarians were welcomed to the province, as reported by The Guardian newspaper. It was believed that the Hungarians were the \"right type\" of immigrant and could contribute to the province's agricultural sector.\n\n\n"}

It is the nearest town to Cape Leeuwin, on the furthest southwest corner of the Australian continent. In the it had a population of 1,091; by 2016 the population of the town was 1,109 (excluding East Augusta).\n\nThe town is within the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River local government area, and is in the Leeuwin Ward. It is connected by public transport to Perth via Transwa coach service SW1.\n\nAugusta was a summer holiday town for many during most of the twentieth century, but late in the 1990s many people chose to retire to the region for its cooler weather. As a consequence of this and rising land values in the Augusta-Margaret River area, the region has experienced significant social change.\n\nThe coastline near the Augusta area was first sighted by Europeans in March 1622 when the Dutch East India Company ship \"Leeuwin\" (Lioness) mapped and named the land north of Cape Leeuwin between Hamelin Bay and Point D'Entrecasteaux \"'t Landt van de Leeuwin\". In 1801 Captain Matthew Flinders named the \"south-western, and most projecting part of Leeuwin's Land\" Cape Leeuwin.\n\nAugusta was founded in 1830. In March of that year, a number of settlers, including John Molloy and members of the Bussell and Turner families, had arrived at the Swan River Colony on board the \"Warrior\". On their arrival the Lieutenant-Governor Captain James Stirling advised them that most of the good land near the Swan River had already been granted, and suggested that they form a new sub-colony in the vicinity of Cape Leeuwin.\n\nThe following month, Stirling sailed with a party of prospective settlers on board the \"Emily Taylor\". After arriving at the mouth of the Blackwood River, the party spent four days exploring the area. Stirling then confirmed his decision to establish a subcolony, the settlers' property was disembarked, and the town of Augusta declared at the site.\n\nStirling named the town in honour of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, the sixth son of George III, due to its location within Sussex County, one of the 26 counties of Western Australia that were designated in 1829 as cadastral divisions.\n\nDuring the 1880s, an expansion of the timber industry occurred following the construction of a timber mill at nearby Kudardup and the completion of jetties at Hamelin Bay and Flinders Bay.\n\nAugusta was a stopping place on the Busselton to Flinders Bay Branch Railway, which was government run from the 1920s to the 1950s.\nPrior to that M. C. Davies had a timber railway system that went to both Hamelin Bay and Flinders Bay jetties in the 1890s.\nOn 30 July 1986, a pod of 114 false killer whales became stranded at Town Beach, Augusta. In a three-day operation, co-ordinated by the Department of Conservation and Land Management, volunteers from around Western Australia, including forestry workers, wildlife officers, surfers and townsfolk, carried 96 of the whales on trucks to more sheltered waters. The surviving whales were then successfully guided out into the bay, flanked by a flotilla of boats, board riders and swimmers. A memorial to the rescue now overlooks Town Beach.\nThe Augusta boat harbour on the coast towards Cape Leeuwin has replaced a range of points where boats have operated from between the mouth of the Blackwood River around to the area of the former Flinders Bay etties.\n\nMany tourist websites and information conflate \"Augusta\" and \"Cape Leeuwin\" with features that exist nearby. The Augusta townsite now also includes the former separate \"Flinders Bay\" community at its southern end, where there had been a jetty, railway terminus, and whaling location. The new \"Augusta Boat Harbour\" to the south of Flinders Bay is well outside of the townsite.\n\nIn 2009, 2 Oceans FM was set up at the Augusta Community Center and began broadcasting on 97.1 MHz FM.\n\nIn 1961, over of farms, bushland and forests between Margaret River and Augusta were destroyed by bushfires. Augusta was saved from these because a serious fire a few months earlier had created a low fuel zone north of the town. The Augusta residents cared for the school children who had been evacuated from Karridale and Kudardup.\n\nA bushfire threatened the town in 2011 and over 200 residents were evacuated. The fire had already claimed before reaching the outskirts of East Augusta, but was later brought under control and no homes were destroyed.\n\nIn January 2018 the town was threatened by a bushfire.\n\n\n\n"}

The name \"Čelik\" means \"Steel\" in Bosnian and it symbolizes the strength and power of the club and the city since Zenica is an industrial city well known in this part of Europe.\n\nNK Čelik is one of the most prominent and successful football teams in Bosnia and Herzegovina being one of only two Bosnian clubs to win the national championship three times in a row – from 1994 to 1997. The club also won two national cups in a row – from 1995 to 1996. During the time of the former Yugoslavia, Čelik had played 17 seasons in the Yugoslav First League.\n\nČelik won the Mitropa Cup two times, and was joint winner of the UEFA Intertoto Cup once. Today, Čelik is in the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is active in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe club has produced many important players including Elvir Bolić, Mirsad Hibić and Mladen Krstajić.\n\nČelik play their home games at the Bilino Polje stadium which is also the biggest stadium in the city. Over the years the club had changed four different stadiums settling at their current ground in 1972.\n\nDuring the first few years of the club's existence, following World War II, Čelik's stadium was located roughly on the place of the current Bilino Polje stadium, close to the Bosna river. The ground was covered in clay, as was the practice of lower-level football grounds at the time. The stadium itself had one wooden stand which was built over time and the club often played in front of full capacity.\n\nHowever, due to the increased popularity of the club and the need for a better surface, during the early 1950s the club moved to the nearby Stadion Blatuša which was located in the Blatuša neighborhood of Zenica. It was there that Čelik started its first run of successes when they had reached promotion to the Yugoslav First League in 1966 and won the Mitropa Cup in 1971 (the final was played on neutral ground in Gorizia, Italy).\n\nShortly after the first Mitropa Cup victory, plans were made for a new, modern stadium, built in place of Čelik's first stadium. The construction took 8 months to complete and it was officially opened on 4 October 1972 for the second leg of the 1972 Mitropa Cup final against Fiorentina which Čelik won 1–0 to claim their second title in a row. The attendance record of 35,000 still stands today due to the introduction of seats on the stadium over the years. The stadium went through a number of renovations and reconstructions, the most recent being in 2012.\n\nFrom July to August 2012, the stadium went through another renovation process where the pitch had been changed and under-soil heating installed beneath. During the reconstruction, Čelik played two Bosnian Premier League matches as well as one Bosnian Cup match on the Stadion Kamberovića Polje, winning all of them. In the second part of the same season, the club played one more game there which ended in a draw.\n\nThe youth squads of Čelik usually play their games at the smaller stadium Kamberovića Polje.\n\nThe ultras supporter group of Čelik was established in 1988 in Zenica. The home team supporters group is called Robijaši (\"Convicts\" in English) because Zenica is famous for its prison.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n"}

JB Landscaping is not doing well due to Jeph's laziness and poor behavior.\n\nPhil and Rona (Jamie Lee Curtis), who are having an affair, meet at the Charm Motel. Phil expresses his happiness about Mona's death but denies involvement. Bobby meets Murph (Mark Pellegrino), his older brother. Due to his financial difficulties, Bobby has been receiving money from Murph, who thinks he had a hand in Mona's death.\n\nWyatt's investigation takes him to Jeph, who claims that Bobby threatened and attacked Mona. Lucinda (Kathleen Wilhoite), the local mechanic specializing in Yugos (which everyone in town drives) informs Wyatt that the car Mona was driving had been tampered with in multiple ways.\n\nPhil tells Wyatt that he had been a battered husband since Mona suspected he was having an affair. He also claims Jeph and Mona had had an argument on the evening before the accident. Bobby tells Wyatt that he hated Mona and that they had had an argument over Jeph's pay. Mona would not let him dissolve the partnership unless Bobby bought them out. Phil and Jeph leave Mona's wake very early.\n\nMeanwhile, Wyatt breaks into the Dearly house and finds that Mona's and Jeph's car keys had been switched. Phil expresses his gratitude to Bobby for killing Mona. Bobby then confesses to Ellie that he rigged Jeph's car, because Jeph was destroying their business. Ellie then announces that she is pregnant. This conversation is overheard by Clarence.\n\nPhil tells Wyatt that he spotted Bobby near the Dearly residence on the night prior to the accident, claiming that he did not say this earlier because Wyatt and Bobby are soon to be family. Jeph, who it turns out is \"also\" involved with Rona, finds out about Phil's affair with her. Bobby tells Wyatt that Mona threatened him, not the other way around, and that he was in the Hideaway the evening before the accident, which, as Valerie tells Wyatt, is not true. Murph later tries to cover Bobby on this. Valerie also gives him a sharp gardening tool with the letters \"JB\" on it.\n\nPhil is discovered dead in a pond at the Charm Motel. Murph tells this to Ellie, who fears that Bobby, who left their house that night, has killed again. When Rona finds out, she tries to leave town. It turns out Jeph did not help Phil when he fell into the water after Phil threatened Jeph that he was going to expose him, Rona, and Bobby.\n\nPolice learn that Jeph is threatening suicide because of Rona's leaving. Jeph reveals that a drunken Mona had, accidentally but unrepentantly, chopped off his right hand when they fought over a bottle of beer. He also states that Phil was not his biological father, adding that, despite all that, he did not kill either of them. Wyatt manages to take the gun away from Jeph.\n\nWyatt then tells Bobby in private that Clarence confessed to killing Phil, because he could not stand the idea of Bobby going to jail, especially with the baby on the way. It turns out that Clarence was watching Phil - who had seen Bobby rig the car - tampering with it some more and then switching the keys in the house. The initial tampering by Bobby had been superficial and did not contribute to the accident, whereas Phil's did.\n\nWyatt promises Bobby to keep quiet about Bobby's involvement as long as he takes good care of Ellie and the baby. Finally, Bobby and Ellie get married and Clarence gets taken away.\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 29% based on 76 reviews, and an average rating of 4.41/10. The critical consensus reads, \"Despite Danny De Vito's top billing, \"Drowning Mona\" drowns itself in humor that never rises above sitcom level. Contributing to the Mona's problems is that the characters are never really interesting, and there is a noticeable lack of energy in the character roles.\"\n\nThe film opened at #4 at the North American box office making $5.8 million USD in its opening weekend behind \"My Dog Skip\", \"The Next Best Thing\" and \"The Whole Nine Yards\". Ultimately, however, the box office gross was an impressive $15.9 million compared with a budget of $6 million. \n\n\n"}

The first units were equipped in UK in the summer of 1941 and in North Africa a year later, 20 guns equipped British and Free French batteries at El Alamein. Subsequently, it also equipped Canadian, Australian, South African, Polish and Indian regiments, and after the war, it was also used by New Zealand. In the Second World War the normal organisation was a regiment of 16 guns organised into two batteries.\n\nThe 5.5 was retained in service after the war. It was used by the Royal Artillery on operations in Korea, South Arabia and Borneo. It was probably used by the Indian Army in wars against Pakistan, and was used by the Pakistan Army against India in the mountains of Kashmir during the Kargil War of 1999.\n\nThe South African Defence Force used it extensively in the early stages of the South African Border War, including Operation Savannah, calling it the G2. Approximately 72 are still held in reserve by the South African Army.\n\nIn British post-war service it also replaced the BL 4.5-inch medium field gun. When 6-gun batteries were introduced in the late 1950s, medium regiments had 18 guns and the third battery in each field regiment was equipped with 5.5 inch guns instead of 25-pounder guns. It remained in UK service with Territorial Army regiments until 1980 and in Australian service until replaced by M198 in about 1984.\n\nThe UK replacement for 5.5 inch was the FH-70 155 mm towed howitzer, in service as the L121. The last 5.5 rounds were fired in the UK in 1995.\n\nIn use, the 5.5 was generally towed by the AEC Matador artillery tractor. From the 1950s in British service, the 5.5 was typically towed by an AEC Militant Mk 1 6x6 truck and subsequently the FV 1103 Leyland Martian 6x6 Medium Artillery Tractor .\n\nAll 5.5 guns were manufactured in the UK.\n\nThere were four marks of 5.5 inch ordnance although only three and, after World War II, four entered service, and the differences were only minor. There were two marks of carriage where the differences were greater use of welding and less of riveting. The carriages were identical to those used with Ordnance BL 4.5 inch Mark 2. No limber was ever used and the gun fired with its wheels in contact with the ground.\n\nDuring World War II the PL Locks and AC Slide Boxes, (a component separate to the gun attached to the bottom and face of the breech block using a rifle-calibre tube insert to initiate firing of the bagged charge) utilising 0.5 inch tubes were replaced by PK Locks and Y Slide Boxes using 0.303 inch tubes.\n\nIt used one man laying and had Probert pattern calibrating sights. The Dial Sight was initially the No 7 but was gradually replaced by the No 9. In the 1960s sights were converted from degrees, minutes and yards to mils and metres. There was no anti-tank telescope. Late in the war a sight adapter was introduced to permit upper register (high angle) fire when the wheels were raised significantly above the level of the spades.\n\nThe normal gun detachment was 10 men.\n\nInitially, the 5.5 inch gun fired a shell, using four charges in two cartridges to give a maximum range table muzzle velocity of and a maximum range of .\n\nIn 1944 an shell was introduced along with Charge Super giving a maximum muzzle velocity of and a range of yards. The new lighter shell contained more explosive and gradually replaced the older, heavier shell.\n\nIn addition to high explosive rounds, there were several types of chemical shell weighing between and coloured smoke shells; coloured flare shells were also developed. After World War 2, only HE was used. There was no AP (armour-piercing) round for the gun but, in an emergency, gunners were taught to remove the impact fuze and fire the unfuzed high explosive as an AP substitute.\n\nThe normal HE fuze was No 117, a percussion, impact fuze that was introduced in 1920 and saw use until the 1960s. In late 1944, the T100 proximity fuze became available.\nNo variants entered service although the UK developed two self-propelled versions to prototype stage. The first in 1945 used the Crusader gun tractor (developed from the Crusader tank to tow 17-pounder anti-tank guns). It was a turretless design with no casemate.\n\nThe second, FV3805, in the 1950s used a Centurion tank carriage, the gun being in a barbette mounting in a fully enclosed casemate. The chassis was reversed, with the enclosed fighting compartment at the rear and the engine, previously at the rear, now at the front. Two prototypes were built, one of which survives and is being restored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside 47 Regt Royal Artillery lines Larkhill\n\n\n"}

He would travel with the Circus and go to local schools when at a location for a lengthy period. One school was 'All Saints' at Blackheath, London in 1958, the heath being a popular location for the circus. The first appearance of the Billy Smart circus was on 5 April at Southall Park in Middlesex. The circus toured alongside Smart's funfair; the tents blew down and the circus carried out its performances for two days in the open air. Smart made his circus debut with \"Billy Smart's New World Circus\" as assistant ringmaster aged 12. He was soon performing with ponies and horses, but became best known later for his elephant acts. In one famous incident, he tamed a herd of performing elephants when they stampeded in the ring. At its peak, Billy Smart's four-masted Big Top could hold over 6,000 people, with a show including hundreds of animals and performers.\n\nSmart, together with his brothers, Ronald Smart and David Smart, took over management of the circus when their father died in 1966 at Ipswich. The circus ceased touring in 1971, but televised performances continued until 1983, drawing audiences of up to 22 million at its height. The Smart Brothers also developed Guernsey Zoo, selling it in 1972, and opened Windsor Safari Park in 1969 before selling it in 1977, for the equivalent of £30m in 2017 (it is now the site of Legoland Windsor). He lost the sight in his right eye in 1978 after cosmetic surgery severed the optic nerve, ending his career as an animal trainer.\n\nIn 1985, the Smart circus Winkfield winter quarters were sold for the equivalent of £20m in 2017.\n\nThe \"Billy Smart's\" touring circus was revived by his brother Ronald and nephew Gary in 1993, but Smart concentrated on a second career as a property developer, based in Spain.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Billy Smart was famous for the annual \"Billy Smart's Kinderkerstcircus\" (\"Billy Smart's Children Christmas Circus\") TV broadcast. Dutch singer Fay Lovsky listed Billy Smart in her 1981 hit \"Christmas Was A Friend of Mine\" as one of her favourite Christmas traditions.\nHis circus was used in the 1967 movie \"Berserk!\", starring Joan Crawford and Diana Dors. In the movie the circus was called the Great Rivers Circus.\nIn 1960, the cult classic \"Circus of Horrors\" directed by Sydney Hayers, was filmed in Billy Smarts Circus. In the picture, it was called the \"Schuler\" circus.\n\nhttp://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/783f280333a248838f44ee38104f6907 - Only Circus attended by a reigning monarch.\n\n\n"}

Urner Goodman\n\nEdward Urner Goodman (May 15, 1891 – March 13, 1980) was an \ninfluential leader in the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) movement for much of the twentieth century. Goodman was the national program director from 1931 until 1951, during the organization's formative years of significant growth when the Cub Scouting and Exploring programs were established. He developed the BSA's national training center in the early 1930s and was responsible for publication of the widely read \"Boy Scout Handbook\" and other Scouting books, writing the \"Leaders Handbook\" used by Scout leaders in the United States during the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1950s, Goodman was Executive Director of Men's Work for the National Council of Churches in New York City and active in church work.\n\nGoodman is best remembered today for having created the Order of the Arrow (OA), a popular and highly successful program of the BSA that continues to honor Scouts for their cheerful service. Since its founding in 1915, the Order of the Arrow has grown to become a nationwide program having thousands of members, which recognizes those Scouts who best exemplify the virtues of cheerful service, camping, and leadership by membership in BSA's honor society. As of 2007, the Order of the Arrow has more than 183,000 members.\n\nGoodman was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where his father, George, was a printer and real estate agent. His mother, Ella, died of typhoid fever in early 1895 when Goodman was just three years old. He attended Central High School, graduating in 1909. He enjoyed writing and began keeping a detailed journal of daily activities during his senior year of high school, expressing his aspirations for the future along with occasional doubts. With several classmates, he began a literary club and published a newsletter, \"The Inkstand\". He also showed interest in music, playing the piano and violin, and composed a song for his high school senior class. When it was not selected by the class officers, he wrote in his journal of his disappointment.\n\nGoodman also took an early interest in church activities as a youth, participating in a boys' brotherhood group and Sunday school and becoming a member of Tioga Presbyterian Church at age 14, an event he described as \"the most important step I ever took or ever will take in my life.\" Just barely out of his teens, Goodman became a popular and highly respected Sunday school teacher and led the Philadelphia chapter of a young men's group called the Brotherhood of Andrew and Philip.\n\nAspiring to a career in education, Goodman enrolled in the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy in 1911. He was selected to be the commencement speaker at his graduation in 1913 and his address was entitled, \"The Call to Teach\". Goodman then did graduate work in education at Temple University, while teaching at the Potter School in Philadelphia.\n\nOn June 18, 1920, Goodman married Louise Wynkoop Waygood, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister and a 1918 honors graduate of Swarthmore College. They had three children: Theodore (born 1921), George (born 1923), and Lydia Ann (born 1927). He was a member of Kiwanis, Rotary International, and a Freemason, joining Robert A. Lamberton Lodge No. 487, Free and Accepted Masons of Philadelphia on March 5, 1918.\n\nWhile studying for his degree in Education, Goodman first became involved in Boy Scouting in 1911 when only 20 years old, as a volunteer Scoutmaster of Troop 1, the first Scout troop in Philadelphia. As far as can be established, this would make him the second-youngest Scoutmaster in the history of the BSA. In his four years as Scoutmaster, the troop grew to more than 100 Scouts. A contemporary of Goodman described him in 1912 as \"well beloved by the boys, enjoys their confidence and is heart and soul in this phase of the work.\" In later years, he would recall with nostalgia his troop, noting that renowned composer Albert Hay Malotte was \"one of his boys\" in Troop 1. In April 1915, he entered full-time professional service in Boy Scouting as a field executive, serving that summer as director of the Philadelphia Scout Council's summer camp. He was promoted in December 1917 to Scout executive of the Philadelphia Council.\n\nGoodman's professional Scouting career was interrupted during World War I, when he was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly after his promotion to Scout executive. He served in the infantry as a first lieutenant, but his unit was never sent overseas. In December 1918, he was discharged from the Army and resumed his professional career as Scout executive in Philadelphia. He served as Scout executive there until May 1927, when he was promoted to the larger Chicago Area Council as Scout executive (1927–1931). During his four-year tenure in the \"Windy City\", he reversed a decline in finances and increased Scout membership from 11,806 to 16,920.\n\nOn April 1, 1931, Goodman was promoted by Chief Scout Executive James E. West to become national program director of the BSA, as part of an organizational restructuring. Goodman was one of four division directors reporting to West (the other divisions were operations, personnel, and business). As national program director, he was responsible for professional and volunteer training, relations with sponsoring organizations, public relations, and program development. The Cub Scouting and Exploring programs were established under his leadership. He greatly expanded BSA training programs for adult leaders, establishing the BSA's highly regarded national training center at Schiff Scout Reservation in New Jersey in 1932 and, later, the training program at Philmont Scout Ranch, beginning in 1938. He also oversaw the publication of the \"Boy Scout Handbook\", edited by his good friend and colleague William \"Green Bar Bill\" Hillcourt, as well as the \"Handbook for Scoutmasters\" and the first edition of the widely read \"Scout Field Book\". Goodman also wrote the \"Leader's Handbook\", a key instructional guide for Scout leaders.\n\nIn early July 1937, the BSA held its first national Scout jamboree in Washington, D. C., attended by 25,000 Scouts and Scouters. In addition to overseeing the innovative event itself, Goodman's public relations service did yeoman work to ensure extensive news media coverage. A jamboree press tent accommodated 626 news media reporters, photographers, and broadcasters. Sixty-four news releases were issued and the public relations service assisted in the making of 11 newsreels and 53 magazine articles. The three major U.S. radio networks of the time, NBC, CBS and Mutual, all set up complete broadcasting studios near the jamboree headquarters to produce almost 19 hours of live, on-site jamboree coverage broadcast coast-to-coast. Celebrities also visited the jamboree, including well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While at the jamboree, Scouts also attended a three-game baseball series between the Washington Senators and the Boston Red Sox at Griffith Stadium, with Goodman arranging for Eagle Scouts to have a place of honor with President Roosevelt in the stands (pictured).\n\nIn his comprehensive biography of E. Urner Goodman, Nelson Block writes that the mutual respect between Goodman and West grew over their 12 years of working together at the national BSA office: \"West, the hardworking, detail-oriented executive, came to rely on Goodman and his style of accomplishing big things through diligent organization and planning, executed by carefully recruited staff...\".\n\nWhen the venerable youth leader and longtime National Scout Commissioner Daniel Carter Beard died shortly before his 91st birthday in June 1941, Goodman was selected to be in charge of the beloved pioneer's funeral in Suffern, New York. An estimated 2,000 people lined the funeral route to the cemetery in Monsey, New York, where formed an honor guard and assisted with traffic control.\n\nAs war clouds cast an ominous shadow over Europe in the late 1930s amidst the rise of fascism, West, Goodman, and other BSA leaders considered how Scouting might better train youth in democratic principles of government. Referring to the Nazi \"Kristallnacht\" rampage against Jews in 1938, Goodman wrote shortly afterwards: \"...the program of persecution has stirred up our hearts and minds as nothing else that has happened before has done. It has furnished the impetus of a wave of resentment against the evil; but more than that, for a surge of satisfaction and thanksgiving concerning our own happier state under a democracy.\" During World War II, various BSA programs were developed under his leadership in support of the nation's war effort, such as the collection of scrap aluminum, tires, and waste paper for recycling into war material, distribution of war bond and air raid posters, assisting Civil Defense officials, and planting of fruit and vegetable \"victory gardens\".\n\nOn September 16, 1951, Goodman retired as national program director, ending a professional Scouting career spanning 36 years. He was given the title of National Field Scout Commissioner, to continue his service to Scouting on the national level as a layman.\n\nAs the Philadelphia Council's newly hired field executive in 1915, one of Goodman's assignments was to serve as director of the council's summer camp at Treasure Island Scout Reservation on the Delaware River. He believed that the summer camp experience should do more than just teach proficiency in Scoutcraft skills; rather, the principles embodied in the Scout Oath and Scout Law should become realities in the lives of Scouts. Along with his assistant camp director, Carroll A. Edson, he started an experimental program to recognize those Scouts best exemplifying those traits as an example to their peers.\n\nGoodman and Edson were strongly influenced by the use of American Indian culture by Ernest Thompson Seton in his Woodcraft Indians program. They decided to create an honor society of their own at camp that summer, in a manner befitting a boy's interest and understanding. Goodman utilized the appeal of Indian lore and recognition by a Scout's peers as motivational tools. He devised a program where troops chose, at the camp's conclusion, those boys from among their number who best exemplified the ideals of Scouting. Those elected were acknowledged as having displayed, in the eyes of their fellow Scouts, a spirit of unselfish service and brotherhood. Edson helped Goodman research the traditions and language of the Lenni Lenape—also known as the Delaware—who had once inhabited Treasure Island.\nThe brotherhood of Scout honor campers with its American Indian overtones was a success and was repeated again the following summer at Treasure Island. Those Scouts honored at Treasure Island in 1915 and 1916 would eventually become members of the Order of the Arrow's Unami Lodge.\n\nBy 1921, Goodman had spoken to Scout leaders in surrounding states about the OA, and lodges were established in a score of Scout councils in the northeast. In October 1921, he convened the first national meeting of what was then called the National Lodge of the Order of the Arrow in Philadelphia, and Goodman was elected Grand Chieftain. Committees were organized to formulate a constitution, refine ceremonial rituals, devise insignia, and plan future development. Reflecting Goodman's ongoing interest in music, he composed the words to the Order of the Arrow's song, \"Firm Bound in Brotherhood\", set to the stirring melody of a hymn found in the Presbyterian hymnal of the 1920s, \"God the Omnipotent\" in 11.10.11.9 meter, which was adapted from the Russian national anthem, \"God Save the Tsar!\", composed by Alexei Lvov in 1833.\n\nIn the early 1920s, many Scout executives were skeptical of what they called \"secret camp fraternities\". By September 1922, opposition to the Order of the Arrow was such that a formal resolution opposing \"camp fraternities\" was proposed at a national meeting of Scout executives. Goodman argued against the motion: \"Using the Scout ideals as our great objective\", he said, a camp activity that will \"further the advancement of those ideals\" should not be suppressed. The motion was narrowly defeated, and the fledgling Order continued as an experimental program throughout the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nGoodman maintained his active support of the OA's National Lodge, as it was then called, during his years as Scout executive in Chicago and then BSA national program director. In observance of the 15th anniversary of the brotherhood's founding, the National Lodge presented Goodman with a medal in 1930 formally recognizing him as founder. In 1940, the National Lodge presented him with the first Distinguished Service Award on the OA's 25th anniversary. The citation said, in part, \"As the founder of the Order of the Arrow, through his ability, wisdom, and foresight, his vision of service to others was transformed into a national honor brotherhood which has been a positive influence in the lives of thousands of boys...\". When he was first appointed as director in 1931, there were OA lodges in seven percent of BSA councils nationwide. By 1948, about two-thirds of the BSA councils had established OA lodges. In that year, three years before Goodman's retirement from the BSA, his \"honor society of Scout camping\" innovation was fully integrated as an official part of the Scouting program. Kenneth Davis, in his book \"The Brotherhood of Cheerful Service: A History of the Order of the Arrow\", concludes that the National Council's approval in 1948 \"...was due largely to his [Goodman's] personal efforts and recommendation...\".\n\nOver the decades since the Order of the Arrow's founding, more than one million Scouts and Scouters have worn the OA sash on their uniforms, denoting membership in the Brotherhood of Cheerful Service. There are presently 183,000 members of the Order of the Arrow in all but two of BSA councils nationwide. Summarizing what he felt the order signified, E. Urner Goodman wrote in the foreword to the \"Order of the Arrow Handbook\" from the perspective of more than a half century after the brotherhood's inception:\n\nFollowing his retirement from professional Scouting, Goodman served the National Council of Churches (NCC) during 1951–1954 as the NCC's first general director of the \"United Church Men\", a laymen's program he formed to strengthen men's ties to local churches and their communities. Goodman publicly inaugurated the laymen's group on October 7, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio. By the end of 1952, United Church Men departments were formed in more than 24 states, providing financial support to NCC-affiliated colleges and missionary work. His new post entailed working closely with Eugene Carson Blake, NCC president (1954–1957), and meeting frequently with officials of the participating denominations in the NCC. Speaking with various men's church groups in the U.S. and abroad was, he believed, a means of promoting brotherhood. Reflecting on his NCC service with these notable church leaders, Goodman said more than a decade later, \"Great faith and devoted service, I am very sure, are for ordinary folk as well as for the clergy. ... I have been privileged to know some great clergymen in my day ... but I have also known and loved some truly great laymen, men whose lives and works matched their faith\". Goodman retired from his NCC post on September 1, 1954 because of tuberculosis.\n\nMaintaining his lifelong interest in music, Goodman was active in the Hymn Society of America (now the Hymn Society in the United States and Canada) in the 1960s and 1970s, and three hymns he composed were published: \"Christ Calls Men\", \"As Within the Pillared Temple\", and \"O God of Love, Who Gavest Life\".\n\nIn 1965, Goodman wrote \"The Building of a Life\", a collection of reminiscences recounting some of his Scouting experiences and giving advice to young men. Summing up his years in Scouting and church work, he wrote, \"In the last analysis, it is the things of the spirit rather than material possessions that count.\" Later that year, the Goodmans moved to the Penney Retirement Community at Penney Farms, Florida. Goodman then served as Director of Christian Education at Flagler Presbyterian Church in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\nIn retirement, the Goodmans enjoyed a rich family life, visiting often with son Theodore (\"Ted\") and his wife Carol, and daughter Lydia Ann (\"Ann\") and son-in-law Bob. To his unabashed delight, Urner and Louise Goodman had nine grandchildren. Their son George was killed in action in France during World War II, however. Upon hearing the news in December 1944, Goodman was deeply grieved, and Louise, his wife of 60 years, said it was the only time she ever saw him cry.\n\nAlthough retired, Goodman remained active in Order of the Arrow affairs during the 1960s and 1970s. Acclaimed as an eloquent orator, his keynote addresses at the OA's biennial National Order of the Arrow Conferences reportedly made an unforgettable impression upon his youthful audiences. Nelson Block writes in \"A Thing of the Spirit\", that even in the 1970s the octogenarian founder \"crisscrossed the country to attend lodge and section events... surrounded by young Arrowmen...witty and charming, keeping everyone enthralled with his stories.\" Displaying his self-deprecating humor, Goodman himself was more prosaic about all of the adulation he received at OA gatherings, writing that, \"to many of the young men I was a museum piece. In fact I have been informed that there was considerable surprise because I didn't hobble in on a cane and mumble in my dentures.\" But, he added, \"I looked upon them with deep emotion, for there was a spiritual bond\".\n\nReflecting on his career, Goodman said late in life:\n\nHe continued speaking with OA members until shortly before his death at age 88, when he succumbed to pneumonia on March 13, 1980, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was buried at Penney Farms, Florida, on March 29, 1980. At his funeral, held at the Penney Memorial Church in Penney Farms, Goodman was eulogized by Executive Secretary of the Order of the Arrow William F. Downs: \"The shake of [his] hand, sincerity of greeting, twinkle in the eye, smile and dignity immediately relayed...the feeling of confidence from the leader, so necessary to build teamwork.

Ruppelt (July 17, 1923 – September 15, 1960) was a United States Air Force officer probably best known for his involvement in Project Blue Book, a formal governmental study of unidentified flying objects. He is generally credited with coining the term \"unidentified flying object\", to replace the terms \"flying saucer\" and \"flying disk\" - which had become widely known - because the military thought them to be \"misleading when applied to objects of every conceivable shape and performance. For this reason the military prefers the more general, if less colorful, name: unidentified flying objects. UFO (pronounced \"Yoo-foe\") for short.\"\n\nRuppelt was the director of Project Grudge from late 1951 until it became Project Blue Book in March 1952; he remained with Blue Book until late 1953. UFO researcher Jerome Clark writes, \"Most observers of Blue Book agree that the Ruppelt years comprised the project's golden age, when investigations were most capably directed and conducted. Ruppelt was open-minded about UFOs, and his investigators were not known, as Grudge's were, for force-fitting explanations on cases.\"\n\nRuppelt was born and raised in Iowa. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps during World War II, and served with distinction as a decorated bombardier: he was awarded \"five battle stars, two theater combat ribbons, three Air Medals, and two Distinguished Flying Crosses\".\n\nAfter the war, Ruppelt was released into the Army reserves. He attended Iowa State College where, in 1951, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering. Shortly after finishing his education, Ruppelt was called back to active military duties after the Korean War began.\n\nHe was assigned to the Air Technical Intelligence Center headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nWhen Project Grudge was ordered dissolved, Project Blue Book was planned to replace it. Lt. Col. N. R. Rosengarten asked Ruppelt to take over as the new project's leader, partly because Ruppelt \"had a reputation as a good organizer\", and had helped get other wayward projects back on track. Though he was initially scheduled to stay with Blue Book for only a few months, when Project Grudge was upgraded in status in late 1951 and renamed Project Blue Book, Ruppelt (then a captain) was kept on as director.\n\nRuppelt wrote that the Air Force's approach to the UFO question \"was tackled with organized confusion.\" In defending General Samford's press conference on 29 July 1952, after the big UFO flap at Washington National Airport, Ruppelt wrote that \"his [Samford's] people had fouled up in not fully investigating the sightings.\" Astronomer and Blue Book consultant J. Allen Hynek thought that Ruppelt did his best, only to see his efforts stymied. Hynek wrote \"In my contacts with [Ruppelt] I found him to be honest and seriously puzzled about the whole phenomenon\".\n\nRuppelt requested reassignment from Blue Book in late 1953 shortly after the Robertson Panel issued its conclusions (based partly on the panel's official report, Ruppelt's Blue Book staff was reduced from more than ten personnel to three, including Ruppelt). He retired from the Air Force not long afterwards, then worked in the aerospace industry. In 1956 he worked as a research engineer for Northrop Aircraft Company, according to publisher information in the online version of his 1956 book \"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects\". Hynek suggested that Ruppelt's \"book should be required reading for anyone seriously interested in the history of this subject\". In the book, Ruppelt detailed his time with Projects Grudge and Blue Book, and offered his assessments of some UFO cases.\n\nIn 1956, Donald Keyhoe asked Ruppelt to join to serve as an adviser to the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) . Ruppelt had recently suffered a heart attack, and declined Keyhoe's offer. Ruppelt's book indicates that Ruppelt held some dim views of Keyhoe and his early writings; Ruppelt stated that while Keyhoe generally had his facts straight, his \"interpretation\" of the facts was another question entirely. He thought Keyhoe often sensationalized the material and accused Keyhoe of \"mind reading\" what he and other officers were thinking.\n\nIn 1960 the expanded edition of Ruppelt's book (20 chapters) was published by Doubleday & Co. In the new chapters, Ruppelt declared UFOs a \"space age myth\".\n\nRuppelt died of a heart attack on September 15, 1960, at the age of 37.\n"}

Hutts are rotund, voracious and grotesque-looking slug-like creatures with a predisposition to being involved as leaders in organized crime. The most famous Hutt and the first to be depicted, from whose design template that later used for other members of the race is derived, is Jabba the Hutt, who appears in the films \"Return of the Jedi\", the Special Edition release of \"A New Hope\", and \"\". Both Jabba and numerous other Hutts additionally feature in various works of the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe, which greatly elaborates on their kind's history, culture and role in galactic society at large.\n\nA Hutt first appeared in the film \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), and was designed by Phil Tippett. Jabba the Hutt is a crime lord that keeps an imprisoned Han Solo as a trophy. He reappeared in a deleted scene that was completed for the Special Edition of \"A New Hope\" in 1997. In \"The Phantom Menace\" (1999), Jabba appears alongside Gardulla the Hutt, the prior owner of main character Anakin Skywalker and his mother, Shmi. She is explained as having lost them while betting on a podrace with junk dealer Watto, and reappeared in \"\" episode \"\". Jabba's infant son Rotta is featured in ; other Hutts feature in the series.\n\nAdult Hutts are similar to shell-less gastropods in appearance and movement. In the novelization of \"Return of the Jedi\", it is mentioned that Hutts are born bipedal, but their \"rump legs\" fuse together over time due to lack of movement. Hutts are extremely long-lived and reproduce asexually, nursing their young in pouches like those of marsupials. Hutts have separate sexes in canon, no longer being hermaphroditic as they were in the Legends continuity. According to Legends, all members of the species are hermaphroditic.\n\nHutt Space is a \"special autonomous region\" of the \"Star Wars\" galaxy on the border between the Mid Rim and the Outer Rim Territories, and located to the galactic east of the Core Worlds. It encompassed the Si'Klaata Cluster, bordered on the Tion Hegemony, and consisted of a thousand inhabited worlds. Hutt Space was named for the Hutt species, who dominated the region.\n\nHutt Space remain freed of Imperial rule owing to its trade of wealth, influence and cooperation with the authorities on Imperial Coruscant. Noted as being a haven of corruption, piracy, and home to the disreputable elements of the galaxy, the Galactic Empire considered Hutt Space an \"open festering wound\" carved across Imperial space.\n\nThe Hutt Cartel was a loose confederation of criminal families, mercenary elements, and front organizations. The Hutt Cartel were financially invested in every illicit enterprise in the Outer Rim; engaged in spice smuggling, slavery, gambling, extortion, and bounty hunting. The nature of this consortium prohibited any strong central authority.\n\nHutts live on the planet Nal Hutta—\"Glorious Jewel\" in Huttese. Nal Hutta is the capital of Hutt Space, the species' empire. The primary moon of Nal Hutta is Nar Shaddaa. Before the establishment of the Old Republic, the Hutts were the dominant species in the galaxy, although they never built up an extensive empire; their dominance focused instead on trade and economic empires.\n\nThe Grand Hutt Council is the \"de facto\" ruling body of the Hutt species, and by extension, the highest authority in all of Hutt-controlled space. The Council was composed of the most influential and high-profile Hutt leaders, its members were responsible for the day-to-day affairs of Hutt Space. When dealing with a foreign power, they elect one of their own to act as 'Head of State'. Despite pretense of legitimacy, its kleptocratic-\"government\" reflected the corrupt nature of its enterprises, being prone to instability as hutt families engaged in endless shadow wars against their rivals.\n\nThe Hutts' native language, Huttese, is a \"lingua franca\" of galactic organized crime.\n\nThe language is a constructed language, with many distorted English words, most having the same syllables as the English. Its phonology is said to be based on the Quechua language. Non-Hutts also speak Huttese, including the Max Rebo Band, Bib Fortuna, and C-3PO.\n\nDue to Jabba's iconically hideous appearance, the image of the Hutt species has been a subject of numerous parodies in popular culture, often invoking the creatures as symbols of gluttony/obesity, greed and corruption. Of particular note is \"Pizza the Hutt\" from the \"Star Wars\" spoof film \"Spaceballs\".\n\n"}

It had nothing in common with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer or the QF 4.5 inch AA gun.\n\nBy the end of the 1930s, the World War 1-era BL 60-pounder of 1905 had reached the end of its usable service life within the ranks of the British Army. A successor was sought and work began on an all-new design that would result in the Ordnance BL 4.5\" medium field gun, a long-range medium gun designed for counter-battery fire. The gun was in use throughout the Second World War and it equipped a number of medium regiments, including half the Canadian ones. In service, the guns were fielded at the regiment level and were taken on by both British and Canadian artillery field groups during the war.\n\nThe 4.5inch (114mm) field gun was a good weapon that could fire a 25 kg HE shell up to 11.6 miles with Charge 3. It matched German 10.5 cm and 150 mm howitzers in range and firepower.\n\nFor the sake of expediency, Mk 1 ordnance was designed to be mounted on the 60-pounder carriage. The Mk 2 was on a new carriage that was also used with the BL 5.5 inch gun that replaced the 6-inch howitzer. There were slight differences between the Mk 1 and Mk 2 equipment, but the maximum range was almost identical. The Mk 1 gun was first issued in 1938 and equipped one or two regiments of the British Expeditionary Force, where they saw their baptism of fire. They also equipped at least one regiment in the North Africa campaign and some were lost in Greece. The 4.5 inch Mk 1 is sometimes mistaken for the 60-pounder. Both Mks were normally towed by the AEC Matador 4 × 4 medium artillery tractor. The Germans gave captured guns the designation \"11.4 cm K 365(e).\"\n\nIn 1941, the 114mm gun was set atop a standardized carriage common to 4.5 inch and 5.5 inch artillery systems. This created the Mk 2 designator. Issues of the Mk 2 ordnance on the common carriage started in 1941 and served in North Africa, Italy and North West Europe. It was withdrawn from field service in 1945, relegated to training purposes and finally declared obsolete in 1959.\n\nThe US 4.5 inch gun M1 used the same shell design, Mk 1D in UK service with a 6/10 crh. This design was noted for its small amount of HE ( in a shell) but the larger fragments that resulted were suited to its counter-battery role. Apart from HE, the only other type of shell was flare used to indicate targets for air attack. It had propellant in charges 1, 2 and 3. Intense rate of fire was 2 rounds per minute, normal rate was one round; gunfire was 2 to 3 rounds per minute.\n\n\n\n"}

(For a discussion of the dynastic politics that motivated this process, see the related article on Saloninus). \n\nThe young Caesar was then established in Sirmium to represent the Licinius family in the government of the troubled Illyrian provinces while Gallienus transferred his attentions to Germany to deal with barbarian incursions into Gaul. Because of his youth (he was probably no more than fifteen at the time), Valerian was put under the guardianship of Ingenuus, who seems to have held an extraordinary command as governor of the Illyrian provinces, i.e. Upper and Lower Pannonia and Upper and Lower Moesia. \n\nIt is reported that Salonina was not happy with this arrangement. Although she could not publicly dispute the decisions of Valerian, the \"pater patriae\" which had been formally agreed by her husband, Gallienus, she suspected Ingenuus's motives and asked an officer called Valentinus, otherwise unknown, to keep an eye on him. Despite this precaution, Valerian died in early 258 in circumstances sufficiently suspicious for Gallienus to attempt to demote Ingenuus. It was this action that sparked the attempted usurpation of the Empire by Ingenuus, who had widespread support among the Illyrian garrisons and the provincial establishment.\n\nAs in case of his brother, Saloninus, who was later made Caesar in Gaul, the little we know of Valerian's short reign in Illyria is indicative of the chaotic situation that prevailed on the northern frontiers of the Empire under Valerian and Gallienus. It seems to show that the mere presence of a member of the Imperial House in a troubled region was not sufficient to assuage local fears of being neglected by the distant Emperor. The local Caesar had to wield undisputed authority in his region and command the resources and the experience to deal with the internal and external threats to its security. Diocletian and Maximian seem to have understood this when they set up Constantius Chlorus and Galerius as Caesars in Gaul and Illyria respectively some thirty-five years later.\n"}

The Akie were featured by Bruce Parry in the BBC series \"Tribe\" (10th episode, 2007).\n\nThe Akie are one of the last actual hunter-gatherers left on the African savanna. Beside hunting they collect honey, which involves 'steaming' out the bees, making it possible for to reach into the hive and grab the honey. They enjoy beer which they make from honey. Due to competition for land with the Maasai, they have recently been more reliant on maize, although this rarely produces enough food to last year around.\n\nThe Akie's closest ethnic and linguistic relatives may be the Ogiek who live farther north in Tanzania and mainly Kenya. They may have been farmers, but were forced to migrate south and resume a hunter-gatherer lifestyle after some hardship. \nThe Akie used to cover the Maasai Steppe, but now agriculture, poaching and other hunters have diminished the natural resources forcing the Akie into a bitter rivalry with the Maasai over land and water.\n\nThe Akie people have their own language, also called Akie. Akie is a moribund endangered language, with only a few elders who speak it.

He was the author of numerous books proposing a systematic interpretation of nature. Boodin's work preserved the tradition of philosophical idealism within the framework of contemporary science. Boodin also focused on the social nature of human behavior believing an understanding required an appreciation of individual participation in social life and interpersonal relationship.\nJohn Elof Boodin was born in Pjätteryd Parish in Älmhult, Kronoberg County, Sweden. Boodin was a younger son of sizable rural family. In his youth, several of his brothers had already immigrated to the United States. During his lifetime additional siblings continued to settle in America. He attended the mission training school established by Swedish Lutheran missionary Peter Fjellstedt in Uppsala. He emigrated to the United States from Småland, Sweden in 1887 at the age of 18. He taught at the parochial school of the First Evangelical Lutheran Church of Galesburg, Illinois.

Al Hidayah (organisation) is a part of Minhaj-ul-Quran \n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran runs a radio station from its mosque in Forest Gate London, it operates Minhaj Welfare Foundation from the mosque and organised a candle lit vigil for people who died in all sorts of terrible ways.\n\nThe Danish branch of the Minhaj-ul-Quran International organization was founded in 1987. It consists of four departments, in which three are located in the Copenhagen area and one in Odense.\n\nIn 2003 about 130 Danish Pakistanis canceled their memberships in Minhaj-ul-Quran in a mass protest against what they described as a closed and undemocratic organization run as a one-man-show by Muhammad Tahir ul-Qadri.\n\nIn 2006 newspaper Jyllands-Posten revealed how the Danish imam and member of Minhaj-ul-Quran Naveed Baig urged the murder of apostates from Islam in a video recording from a gathering held in Minhaj-ul-Quran’s mosque in Valby in 1994. Baig was translating to Danish a speech held in Urdu by a guest imam from Pakistan.\n\nHaving established in Copenhagen during the late 1980s, Ul-Qadri's cassettes and videotapes started spreading throughout much of the Pakistani diaspora community in Norway. In 1990 the Norwegian branch of the Minhaj-ul-Quran International organization was founded in Oslo in 1990. It was started out by 20-30 people renting two small rooms in Tøyengata at Tøyen in central Oslo. Its number of memberships quickly increased. In February 1999 a department of Minhaj-ul-Quran was founded in Stavanger. In 2006 the Oslo department had close to 4 000 members, and was the third largest mosque in Oslo after Central Jamaat-e Ahl-e Sunnat and World Islamic Mission. Drammen Moské, founded in 1987, was affiliated with Minhaj-ul-Quran for some time, but chose to cut their ties.\n\nMQI has various community related projects which are supported by the Norwegian Government. One of the main projects is the Minhaj conflict resolution or Minhaj Konfliktråd (MKR).\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran differs from other mosques in Oslo by openly endorsing the Pakistani political party Pakistan Awami Tehreek, while other mosques either do not participate in similar political activities or claim not be involved in politics. Their engagement in this specific political party is due to both organizations sharing the same founder in Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri.\n\nWhen Tahir-ul-Qadri backed Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa of 1989 demanding the execution of Salman Rushdie for writing a book perceived as blasphemous towards Islam, he received support from the leader of the Norwegian branch of Minhaj-ul-Quran, who also criticized the Norwegian authorities for even communicating with Rushdie.\n\nA conflict erupted in the Kristiansand department after an imam sent to Norway in 1995 from the organizations headquarters in Lahore discovered that the leadership of the congregation showed unwilling to subordinate themselves to the governing body in Pakistan. The imam had a new, loyal board elected, and statuted new regulations that reaffirms that the congregation at any given time was to be subordinate to the headquarters in Lahore and Tahir-ul-Qadri. This act in turn lead to a dispute over whether power was to lie with Tahir ul-Qadri in Pakistan or the local faction which wanted a locally rooted mosque. After lawsuits and police reports filed back and forth, the conflict reached its climax in court in March 1998 when the fraction supporting Ul-Qadri came out on the losing end. The imam sent from Pakistan had his residence permit revoked and was expelled back home to Lahore. The newly elected leader Akmal Ali expressed that his congregation in Kristiansand does not want to be associated with Ul-Qadri whatsoever. Ali claimed Ul-Qadri insisted that everything was to belong to Pakistan, while the congregation in Kristiansand wished to remain independent.\n\nIn 2000 the Oslo department deposed its imam Syed Ikram Jillani on the grounds that the board asserted his teachings were contrary to that of Tahir ul-Qadris. Leader of Minhaj Ungdom, Faiz Alam, justified the dismissal by pointing out that the congregation is following the philosophy of its religious head Tahir ul-Qadri in Pakistan, using his books and videos, and cannot accept that an imam runs a different scheme. Syed Ikram Jillani was later hired as an imam at World Islamic Mission.\n\nMaking use of undercover journalism newspaper Dagens Næringsliv in October 2004 revealed how Minhaj-ul-Quran in Oslo will assist Pakistani Norwegian parents looking to send their children off to Quranic schools in Pakistan in order to rid them of what they perceive to be excessive influence from the modern Western environment they live in. The president of Minhaj-ul-Quran Oslo, who otherwise speaks the importance of integration and active participation in Norwegian society, showed willing to provide a place among a selection of Quranic schools he recommended. Confronted a few days later, he denied the statements he had made, until he was informed the conversation had been recorded.\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran holds one of the largest annual Itikaf gatherings during the month of Ramadan with approximately 37,000 people sitting congregational Itikaf in 2007. It holds the largest Laylat ul Qadr night event on the 27th Ramadan with millions of attendees.\n\nOn 3 December 2005 Minhaj-ul-Quran established a full-time institution called \"Gosha-e-Durood\" where any individual can apply to sit for reciting salutations on Muhammad. A building dedicated to this purpose with \"Mawlana\" Rumi style minarets is under construction.\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran International is the first organisation of its kind that has initiated interfaith dialogues with religious minorities in Pakistan. Its founder is the Chairman of the 'Muslim Christian Dialogue Forum' to highlight and promote their citizen rights.\n\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has formally recognised and granted a 'Special Consultative Status' to Minhaj-ul-Quran International for its work.\n\nIn September 2011, Minhaj-ul-Quran organised a major \"Peace for Humanity\" conference at Wembley Arena in London at which, under the auspices of Tahir-ul-Qadri, its 12,000 attendees announced a global declaration denouncing racism, interfaith intolerance, extremism and terrorism. Minhaj-ul-Quran strategist Joel Hayward wrote the declaration text for Qadri and was its second formal signatory after Qadri himself. Notably, senior Al-Azhar University leaders and dignitaries then signed it before Minhaj-ul-Quran opened it up via the internet for public signing. They aim to get one million signatures within a year. The London Declaration for Global Peace and Resistance against Extremism is intended as an interfaith document which unequivocally condemns all extremism and terrorism, ”because at the heart of all religions is a belief in the sanctity of the lives of the innocent.” The Declaration adds: “The indiscriminate nature of terrorism, which has in recent years killed far more civilians and other non-combatants than it has combatants, is un-Islamic, un-Judaic, un-Christian and it is indeed incompatible with the true teachings of all faiths.” The London Declaration also “unequivocally condemn[s] anti-Semitism (including when sometimes it is disingenuously clothed as anti-Zionism), Islamophobia (including when it is sometimes disingenuously dressed up as patriotism) and all other forms of racism and xenophobia.” Some extremists have already tried to prevent the success of the Declaration via cyber-attacks on the website hosting it.\n\nTahir-ul Qadri announced the largest March in modern times in Pakistan; a march to take place on 14th Jan 2013 at 'Tahrir Square' Islamabad. The agenda of long march is to voice elimination of feudalism, introduction of real democracy, rule of law and implementation of constitution.\n\n\n"}

They were the second variety of British Rail's standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs derived from PEP stock, which eventually encompassed 755 vehicles and five Classes (Class 313/314/315/507/508). The 507s were the first variant to be 750 V DC third rail only. They have worked on the Merseyrail network from new, and continue to do so, having been refurbished by Alstom's Eastleigh Works.The Class 507 unit is now years old, making them among the oldest units still in service on the UK mainland rail network, after the Class 313.\n\nWith the Class 502 units life-expired, unable to cope with the demands of the new \"Link\" tunnel and approaching 40 years old, by 1977 a replacement was sought. Owing to the success of the Class 313 fleet on suburban services from King's Cross, four sets were temporarily transferred to Merseyside and based at Hall Road TMD. Sets 313013/063 were used for clearance trials on the Southport, Ormskirk and Kirkby-Garston lines. The results showed that a similar type of stock would be suitable for the Merseyrail Northern Line.\n\nInitially, 47 sets were ordered (507001-507047) but cost issues forced this number to be reduced to 38 units, then 30 by early 1978 when the first sets were under construction. Ultimately, 33 units were built between September 1978 and October 1979.\nThe first set was delivered to Birkenhead North depot during September 1978, with the first test run taking place on 9 October 1978.\n\nOn 25 October 1978, a Royal Special involving units 507001 and 507002 conveyed HM the Queen and several other VIPs on a special service between Moorfields and Kirkby. Following the journey, she declared the new-look Merseyrail network officially open. The first passenger working occurred on 1 November 1978 with 507001 working the 0739 Southport-Liverpool Central with a commemorative headboard. It worked between Liverpool and Southport for the remainder of the day, while 507002 operated between Liverpool and Ormskirk. Further 507s steadily entered service and the 502s were in turn withdrawn. By mid 1980, Northern Line services were entirely in the hands of the 507s, and all of the sets were in service by October 1980.\n\nFollowing privatisation, the 507s were used interchangeably between both the Northern Line and the Wirral Line, working a further four routes regularly. A host of new liveries appeared following sectorisation of British Rail. The remaining 32 units were refurbished by Alstom Eastleigh during 2002-2005. They received new interiors, CCTV, light clusters dot matrix displays and the 2+3 seating replaced with 2+2 seats. Unit 507033 was the last Merseyside set to be refurbished, entering service having been named \"Cllr George Howard\" in August 2005.\n\n507022 was written off as a result of a serious collision with 507004 at Kirkdale TMD on 30 September 1991. Driving motor 64388 is now in 507004, as the latter's was damaged beyond repair, and the other motor carriage, renumbered, went to Glasgow-based 314203. To date, this is the only withdrawn Class 507 set.\n\nCollisions with buffer stops at terminal stations have also occurred. Sets 507029 and 507032 both received damage due to overrunning at Kirkby in 1991 and 1997 respectively. Set 507019 was involved in a collision at West Kirby on 11 January 2007 and carriage 64423 had to be sent to Crewe Works for repair.\n\nOn 30 June 2009 unit 507002 without a driver rolled out of Kirkdale TMD, derailing at a set of points further down. The incident, which caused disruption to many services, was caused by failure to apply the brakes whilst maintenance was performed so that when isolating wooden paddles were removed from between the conductor rail and pick-up shoes, the train moved off without a driver on board. On 23 May 2011, it was announced by the Office of Rail Regulation that Merseyrail were fined £85,000 and ordered to pay legal costs of £20,970.15 due to the breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 leading to this incident.\n\n507s are formed of three cars, and numbered 507001 to 507033. Original plans were drawn up for 47; later 38 507s to be built, but costs enforced a reduction in the number. Sets are made up of two driving motor cars ('A' DMSO with the compressor; 'B' BDMSO with the battery) and a trailer. Car numbering is as follows:\n\nOriginally, each 3-car set seated 234 passengers, this figure being reduced to 222 following interior modifications during the 1990s. After the introduction of high back seats during refurbishment in 2004/2005 this was reduced to 192 with space for cyclists and disabled people improved.\n\nThe 507s (and 508s) replaced LMS-designed Class 502 EMUs on the Northern Line and Class 503 EMUs on the Wirral Line.\n\nFrom new, all 507s have worked the Merseyrail network. Sets have been used interchangeably between the Northern Line and the Wirral Line since 1997, so work the following:\n\n\n\n507s have appeared in various colours over their lifetimes.\n\nMerseyrail expected that the 507s and 508s would be withdrawn around 2014 and replaced by a new EMU, but this was postponed following a refurbishment. In May 2012, Merseytravel announced that it had formally begun a project for replacement of the 507s and 508s. The fleet received a refresh package including external re-livery, internal enhancements and engineering work.\n\nIn January 2016 Merseytravel announced the short list of companies bidding to build new trains which will replace the Class 507 and Class 508s on the Merseyrail network. In December 2016, Merseytravel announced that Stadler had won the £460 million contract and that the new trains would be delivered from summer 2019 with all the old trains replaced by 2021.\n\nNamed units are as follows:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939689", "title": "Nattens madrigal", "text": "Nattens madrigal\n\nNattens Madrigal – Aatte Hymne Til Ulven I Manden (translated as \"\"Madrigal of the Night – Eight Hymns to the Wolf in Man\"\") is the third studio album by Norwegian band Ulver, issued on 3 March 1997 via Century Media. Composed and arranged during the first half of 1995, \"Nattens\" is a concept album about wolves, the night, the moon, and the dark side of mankind.\n\nThe third and final album in what has become known as Ulver's “\"Black Metal Trilogie\",” \"Nattens madrigal\" marked the band's international debut and showcases an abrasive black metal style similar to the darker, heavier tracks on \"Bergtatt\", abandoning acoustic and atmospheric elements with an intentionally underproduced sound. The album has been described as “raw and grim black metal at its blackest.”\n\nAn urban legend regarding the album is that band spent the recording budget on Armani suits, cocaine and a Corvette and recorded the album outdoors in a Norwegian forest on an 8-track recorder. Kristoffer Rygg, however, has stated that this is not true and possibly a rumour started by Century Media.\n\nMetal Injection concluded \"\"Kveldssanger\" had no electric instruments, \"Nattens Madrigal\" had no acoustic instruments, but \"Bergtatt\", has both acoustic and electric instruments; it’s like they spliced the elements from \"Bergtatt\" into two separate albums. If that’s the case, then \"Nattens Madrigal\" really showcases the black metal prowess of the band. The album answers exactly why people were so angered by Ulver’s transition away from black metal, and why people are still bitter at their direction today.” However, there are acoustic instruments on the album, for example on the first track.\n\nCommenting on the rumours surrounding \"Nattens Madrigal\", Rygg said, \"Do you really think that Century Media advanced us so much that we could buy a black Corvette? Maybe some suits and drugs; I won't deny that. Or deny that we recorded it cheap. I'll let the myth carry on.” Continuing, \"We didn't have anything to do with those rumours. The moment the big labels picked up black metal, that was the beginning of the end of black metal as far as I see it. They started to exploit the genre by stuff like that-dumb sales pitches-that took the heart out of a lot of it. It became very banal. I'm not blaming Century Media, but I definitely think that that marked the beginning of the end of black metal for me. Putting out \"Nattens Madrigal\" via a big label was kind of an antagonistic move. They probably expected a prettied-up \"Bergtatt\", you know? We didn't want to conform to any business model. We still don't. It got into the mainstream and people became very adept at playing and producing professional records, and as a result of that it lost a lot of the magic that it held to me when I was a teenager listening to old Celtic Frost rehearsals, or old Mayhem demos. I'm still very much like that. I'd rather listen to old lo-fi recordings than the perfect retro-band, you know. So I was part of a different scene, a different vibe.\" Adding, \"We composed \"Nattens Madrigal\" quite quickly after \"Bergtatt\". And while we were rehearsing the Madrigal we recorded \"Kveldssanger\", the second one. So I think that we spent about a year on that record. It was written in '95, recorded in '96, and was finally released early '97.\"\n\nWriting for AllMusic, Steve Huey said “It's so fast and ferocious and the vocals so garbled that it's best just to take the sheer sonic force as reflecting the band's concept, rather than trying to piece it all together.”\n\nJohn Chedsey, writing for Satan Stole My Teddybear, said that \"\"Nattens Madrigal\" thus has to be taken on two levels: the actual immediate aesthetics of the production and then the compositional department. Based on songwriting alone (which takes a bit of effort to discern), \"Nattens Madrigal\" is a tour de force that would have redefined the most extreme of black metal had it been more palatable. Played at warp speed with hidden melodies, sublime guitar leads and a sense of apocalyptic devastation, \"Nattens Madrigal\" is one of the most impressive albums of its kind. That is, of course, assuming one has put aside the way it sounds. It's a bit like ignoring the quills of a porcupine and telling others what a cuddly housepet it makes.”\n\nIn 2009, IGN included \"Nattens Madrigal\" in their \"10 Great Black Metal Albums\" list.\n"}

It is the fifth-oldest women's college in the United States, having been founded by members of Siloam Baptist Church in 1838. Judson was named after Ann Hasseltine Judson, the first female foreign missionary from the United States to Burma (now Myanmar). It has been affiliated with the Alabama Baptist Convention throughout its history and is funded by the convention.\n\nEnrollment at Judson in 2019 was 268. The college offers bachelor's degrees in both liberal arts and pre-professional programs.\n\nThe principal building of the campus is Jewett Hall, the third of this name. The first Jewett Hall, built in 1840, was a four-story Greek revival building named after Dr. Milo P. Jewett, first president of the college. It was destroyed by fire in 1888. The rebuilding of Jewett Hall was begun that same year. In 1947 the dome was hit by a lightning strike and fire consumed the building. Rebuilding efforts began almost immediately, and funds were raised by the sale of bricks from the rubble. A third fire occurred in the attic of this building as mattresses were lit on fire, but the fire was put out without much damage to the building.\n\nOther notable buildings on campus include A. Howard Bean Hall, a former Carnegie library which now houses the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame as well as 2 classrooms, the Alumnae Auditorium, and the Women's Missionary Union residence hall.\n\nJudson College participates in joint social and civic events with Marion Military Institute, also located in Marion. Many of these events and traditions date as far back as the civil war and are connected culturally to that era.\n\nJudson College students participate in big sister/little sister activities. In the spring semester of their first year, freshman students will receive a big sister from the sophomore class. Throughout the second year, students will go through several secret tradition ceremonies. The big sister leads the little sister through these ceremonies and provides for them the materials and things they need to pass on the traditions to later classes.\n\nEvery April, Judson hold its J-Day. J-Day is like a homecoming event, and alumnae come from all over the country to celebrate and hold reunions. J-Day replaced the older tradition of May Day, which involved a May Pole. J-Day has a court similar to many homecoming celebrations, but one can liken the Pageant or Hockey Day as much closer to homecoming. J-day is usually within a week of Marion Military Institute's Alumni Day and is much closer in content to that event.\n\n\n\n"}

It borders the Dnieper to its west with Holosiivskyi District of Kiev is lying across it, Dniprovskyi District of Kiev city to its north, Brovary Raion of Kiev Oblast to its east and Boryspil Raion of Kiev Oblast to its east and south. The population of the city raion is estimated around 250,000 inhabitants.\n\nAlthough an exact date of establishment of the area is not known, there is evidence that during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, a Neolithic settlement existed near lake \"Svyatyshche\" (). During the 9th century, Darnytsia was an important center of the Kievan Rus', where ambassadors and delegations from other powers were housed while waiting to meet the \"kniaz\" and offer gifts. This gave the area its name \"Darnytsia\" (derived from Slavic/Ukrainian \"dar\", meaning gift).\n\nWhile throughout the 19th century the area was progressively becoming more densely populated, the dwellers were technically residing outside of Kiev in village-like (but non-village by status) settlements called Slobidkas (Sloboda, \"Slobodka\" in Russian). Certain parts on Darnytsia still bear the names of the Slobidka they displaced (notably \"Mykilska Sloboda\" St. Nicholas Settlement).\n\nUntil the late 19th century, the name Darnytsia was commonly applied to the plain on the left bank of Dnieper river () across from the Kiev city center. Up to the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the area was legally part of the Chernigov Governorate (Chernihiv), despite being adjacent to Kiev, also a center of its Guberniya, with the Dnieper river being the official division line. The village of Nova-Darnytsia and the rest of the area of the today's raion were incorporated into the city of Kiev in 1927. In 1935 Darnytsia became a separate raion of the city.\n\nThe urbanized area started industrializing between World War I and World War II, after becoming a part of Kiev. Following World War II, the area underwent a major reconstruction and modernization and became heavily industrialized, with the installation of chemical, textile, pharmaceutical and food processing industries. Major infrastructure projects, including heat-and-power co-generation units, railroad stations, highways and Metro lines were accomplished. Several research institutes found their new home here, including three major chemical institutes of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.\n\nToday, the term \"Darnytsia\" is sometimes broadly (but incorrectly) applied to the entire Left Bank area of Kiev, except the distant areas of Vigurovshchyna-Troyeshchyna to the North and Pozniaky to the South. Formally, the district underwent many border changes, and today encompasses approximately one-third of the Left Bank. A planned district change could make Darnytsia district either expand to encompass half of the Left Bank area or cease to exist being redistributed between Desna and Dnipro Raions.\n\nThe Darnytsia neighbourhood borders are generally understood to be:\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1913. Judson was formed out of the liberal arts component of Northern Baptist Theological Seminary. When the seminary moved from Chicago to Lombard, Illinois, it was decided to make the college separate from the seminary. Originally known as Judson College, it was named after Adoniram Judson, the first American Baptist missionary to foreign shores. The university has campuses in Elgin and Rockford, Illinois, and a student body of approximately 1,300. Judson College became Judson University on August 28, 2007.\n\nJudson was formed out of the liberal arts component of Northern Baptist Theological Seminary (NBTS), which was founded in 1913. In the early 1960s, when the seminary portion of Northern moved from Chicago to Lombard it was decided to make the college an independent entity. Under the guidance of Dr. Benjamin P. Browne, the college and seminary president, Judson College was founded along the shores of the Fox River in Elgin in 1963. The college was named after Adoniram Judson, the first American missionary abroad, who went to Burma in 1813 and would spend 37 years overseas.\n\nThe land where Judson College was founded was an estate belonging to Mrs. Margaret Deuterman, a doctor's widow. Mrs. Deuterman was ready to sell the estate at $150,000 to a business that was planning to convert it into an entertainment club, but she was willing to listen to Browne and the other men from NBTS in their effort to use the estate to build the college. Mrs. Deuterman agreed to sell the estate for $100,000, and all she required was $500 earnest money to secure the property. No one else had any cash, except for Browne, who had $5. But Dr. Amos Barton, a college trustee who owned a construction business, had his company checkbook, and he agreed to “loan” the college the $500 needed to secure the property. The college received a charter from the State of Illinois, dated March 11, 1963.\n\nJudson College was financially strapped for most of its first ten years of existence and faced fierce opposition from the trustees of NBTS, other Baptist seminaries, other Baptist colleges, and even from the leadership of the American Baptists. Despite this, enrollment continued to grow, and by its fifth year, Judson was sending more graduates to Baptist seminaries than all the other established Baptist colleges.\n\nJudson College became Judson University on August 28, 2007.\n\n\nJudson University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and has more than 60 undergraduate majors, minors and pre-professional programs and is currently the only evangelical Christian college or university to offer a fully accredited graduate program in architecture.Its Master of Architecture degree is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). \n\nIn addition, Judson offers a Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, a Master of Arts in Human Services Administration, a Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership, a Master of Business Administration, a Master of Education in Literacy, and a Master of Leadership in Ministry. Furthermore, Judson offers three doctorate degrees including: Doctor of Education in Computer Science, Doctor of Education in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies, and our distinctive Doctor of Education in Literacy.\n\nJudson was ranked 24th in the list of Midwest Regional colleges by \"U.S. News & World Report\" in 2014..\n\nThe university offers programs and extra curricular activities in fine arts, including degrees in art and design, music, and concentrations in theater. \n\nThe Draewell Gallery, housed in the Harm A. Weber Academic Center, hosts student work as well as exhibits from artists across the country and around the world. The School of Art, Design and Architecture features a Lecture and Exhibition Series each fall and spring semester. Invited artists tend to show three-to-five times a semester along with one-to-three student shows mainly for senior exhibition.\n\nThe Judson University Theater Program, directed by faculty members Dr. Brenda Buckley-Hughes, Professor Kimberly Schmidt, and alumnus Dave Hunter, offers a musical, traditional play and a Nowhere Near Broadway production each fall and spring semester. In recent years, the theater program has produced Shakespeare performances and such plays as \"Steel Magnolias\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"The Wizard of Oz\", and coming October 2011, \"Children of Eden.\" \nOff-Stage Improv is a student-led, school-approved group that performs once a month.\n\nThe Music Department at Judson University offers degrees in professional music performance, music education, music ministry, and most recently, music business and entrepreneurship. The university has a variety of performing musical groups including symphonic and orchestral bands, choral groups and ensembles.\n\nJudson is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) as well as the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA).

She attended Klein High School in Houston before going to University of Texas. As a child, Wilkinson was a gymnast, but had to give up on the sport after a growth spurt during puberty made her too tall to continue. It was then that she turned to diving. When she first started diving, a teacher told her she was too old to start a new sport and was later kicked off her high school team because they thought she was a \"waste of space\". Wilkinson is a 2001 graduate of the University of Texas, where she majored in public relations. While attending school on a scholarship, she decided that she would rather put school on hold and go after her dream to become an Olympian. She trained in The Woodlands, Texas and is married to Eriek Hulseman. They welcomed their first child, a girl, Arella Joy, on May 11, 2011. In December 2012, they adopted a baby from China named Zoe. Wilkinson gave birth to a son, Zadok, in January 2014. Their fourth child, Dakaia, joined the family from Ethiopia in March 2018. She also travels around the country speaking to girls at The Revolve Tour, a Christian girls' conference.\n\nWilkinson's interest in the sport began as she was swimming in the gym's pool and watched a young female diver in training execute an impressive dive. Her first jump off the 10 meter platform didn't occur until she was 15 years old. She took up platform diving and joined the U.S. national team in 1995.\n\nSix months prior to the 2000 Summer Olympics, Wilkinson suffered a serious foot injury that kept her out of action for a couple of months. She employed a visualization technique to practice her dives during this time, and wasn't fully healed when she qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Still in pain from her foot injury, she landed in eighth place after the first of five dives in the platform finals. She went on to earn the first gold medal for a female American platform diver since 1964.\n\nWilkinson finished in fifth place at the 2004 Summer Olympics, but had left an impact on her competitors. Several of them repeated the techniques she used at the 2000 Olympics by starting their dives with a handstand.\n\nOn June 26, 2008, Wilkinson qualified as a member of the 2008 U.S. Olympic Diving Team in diving by taking first place in the trials. She had already announced her retirement and this Olympics would be her final competition.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

It was considered a very distinct subspecies of the sharp-beaked ground finch (\"Geospiza difficilis\") endemic to Wolf and Darwin Islands. The International Ornithologists' Union has split the species supported by strong genetic evidence that they are not closely related, and divergences in morphology and song. Other taxonomic authorities still consider it conspecific.\n\nThe vampire finch is sexually dimorphic as typical for its genus, with the males being primarily black and the females grey with brown streaks. It has a lilting song on Wolf, a buzzing song on Darwin, and whistling calls on both islands; only on Wolf, a drawn-out, buzzing call is also uttered.\n\nThis bird is most famous for its unusual diet. When alternative sources are scarce the vampire finch occasionally feeds\nby drinking the blood of other birds, chiefly the Nazca and blue-footed boobies, pecking at their skin with their sharp beaks until blood is drawn. Curiously, the boobies do not offer much resistance against this. It has been theorized that this behavior evolved from the pecking behavior that the finch used to clean parasites from the plumage of the booby. The finches also feed on eggs, stealing them just after they are laid and rolling them (by pushing with their legs and using their beak as a pivot) into rocks until they break. Finally guano and leftover fish from other predators additionally serve as diet options. \n\nMore conventionally for birds, but still unusual among \"Geospiza,\" they also take nectar from Galápagos prickly pear (\"Opuntia echios\" var. \"gigantea\") flowers at least on Wolf. The reason for these peculiar feeding habits is the lack of freshwater on these birds' home islands.

IL is closely related to information management, information operations and information technology.\n\nThe term \"Information Logistics (IL)\" may be used in either of two ways:\n\nA term which is closely related to the first meaning of Information Logistics is \"Data Logistics\", a concept used in Computer Networking.\n\"The study of solutions to problems in Computer Systems that flexibly span resources and services relating to Data Movement, Data Storage and Data Processing.\" [ref?]\nSystems that support general Data Logistics solutions thus must span the traditionally separate fields of Networking, File/Database Systems and Process Management.\nData Logistics is a more general form of the term \"Logistical Networking\", used as the name of a particular network storage architecture and software stack.\n\nThe goal of Information Logistics is to deliver the right product, consisting of the right information element, in the right format, at the right place at the right time for the right people at the right price and all of this is customer demand driven.\nIf this goal is to be achieved, knowledge workers are best equipped with information for the task at hand for improved interaction with its customers and machines are enabled to respond automatically to meaningful information.\n\nMethods for achieving the goal are:\n\n\nThe expression was formed by the Indian mathematician and librarian S. R. Ranganathan .\n\nThe supply of a product is part of the discipline Logistics. The purpose of this discipline is described as follows:\n\nLogistics is the teachings of the plans and the effective and efficient run of supply. The contemporary logistics focuses on the organization, planning, control and implementation of the flow of goods, money, information and flow of people.\n\nInformation Logistics focusses on information. Information (from Latin informare: \"shape, shapes, instruct\") means in a general sense everything that adds knowledge and thus reduce ignorance or lack of precision. In stricter sense information becomes information only to those who can interpret it. Interpreting information will provide knowledge.\n\nAn information element (IE) is an information component that is located in the organizational value chain.\nThe combination of certain IEs leads to an information product (IP), which is any final product in the form of information that a person needs to have.\nWhen a higher number of different IEs are required, it often results in more planning problems in capacity and inherently leads to a non-delivery of the IP.\n\nTo illustrate the concept of an IP, an example is shown of a bottleneck analysis in HR (by J. Willems 2008). Here, the illustration shows how the information elements (e.g. qualifications) build up the information product (e.g. HR file).\n\nData logistics is a concept that developed independently of information logistics in the 1990s, in response to the explosion of Internet content and traffic due to the invention of the World Wide Web (WWW).\nSome motivations for the emergence of interest in Data Logistics included:\n\nThe growth in the volume of Web hits, combined with the steady increase in the size of Web-delivered objects such as images, audio and video clips resulted in the localized overloading of the bandwidth and processing resources of the local and/or wide area network and/or the Web server infrastructure.\nThe resulting Internet bottleneck can cause Web clients to experience poor performance or complete denial of access to servers that host high volume sites (the so-called Slashdot effect).\n\nThese factors led to interest in the use of large scale storage (and to a lesser extent, processing) resources to cache the response to network requests, first at the Internet endpoint using a Web browser cache and later at intermediate network locations using shared network caches.\nThis line of development also gave rise to Web server replication and other techniques for offloading and distributing the work of delivering large volume Web services to widely dispersed client communities, ultimately resulting in the creation of modern Content delivery networks.\n\nAt the same time, research efforts in server replication and content delivery gave rise to a number of related projects and strategies, including Logistical Networking (LN).\nThe name LN was intended as an analogy to physical supply chain logistics, in which goods are not only carried from source to destination on networks of roads, but are also stored at warehouses located throughout the transportation infrastructure.\nThis led to a nomenclature in which LN network storage resources are termed \"storage depots\".\nThe principles that underpin LN have been abstracted into the more general study of scheduling and optimization across the traditional infrastructure silos of Storage, Networking and Processing which was named Data Logistics.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although the date and place of the ship's construction are uncertain, it was originally believed she was built for merchant service in Bristol, England in 1710 and named Concord, later captured by French privateers and renamed La Concorde. This origin hypothesis was found to be incorrect and has been dismissed by the project crew. After several years' service with the French (both as a naval frigate and as a merchant vessel – much of the time as a slave trading ship), she was captured by Blackbeard in 1717. Blackbeard used the ship for less than a year, but captured numerous prizes using her as his flagship.\n\nIn May 1718, Blackbeard ran the ship aground at Topsail Inlet, now known as Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, United States, in the present-day Carteret County. After the grounding, her crew and supplies were transferred to smaller ships. In 1996 Intersal, Inc., a private firm, discovered the remains of a vessel that was later determined to be \"Queen Anne's Revenge\", which was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe ship that would be known as \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" was a 200-ton vessel believed to have been built in 1710. She was handed over to René Duguay-Trouin and employed in his service for some time before being converted into a slave ship, then operated by the leading slave trader René Montaudin of Nantes, until sold in 1713 in Peru or Chile. She was briefly re-acquired by the French Navy in November 1716, but was sold by them for commerce five months later in France, again for use as a slaver. She was captured by Blackbeard and his pirates on 28 November 1717, near the island of Saint Vincent in the West Indies.\n\nAfter selling her cargo of slaves at Martinique, Blackbeard made the vessel into his flagship, adding more heavy cannon and renaming her \"Queen Anne's Revenge\". The name may come from the War of the Spanish Succession, known in the Americas as Queen Anne's War, in which Blackbeard had served in the Royal Navy, or possibly from sympathy for the Jacobite cause (Queen Anne being the last Stuart monarch). Blackbeard sailed this ship from the west coast of Africa to the Caribbean, attacking British, Dutch, and Portuguese merchant ships along the way.\n\nShortly after blockading Charleston harbor in May 1718, and refusing to accept the Governor's offer of a pardon, Blackbeard ran \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" aground while entering Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina on 10 June 1718. A deposition given by David Herriot, the former captain of the sloop \"Adventure\", states \"Thatch's [Teach's] ship \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" run a-ground off of the Bar of Topsail-Inlet.\" He also states that \"Adventure\" \"run a-ground likewise about Gun-shot from the said Thatch\" in an attempt to kedge \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" off the bar. Blackbeard then disbanded his flotilla and escaped by transferring supplies onto the smaller \"Adventure\". He stranded several crew members on a small island nearby, where they were later rescued by Captain Stede Bonnet. Some suggest Blackbeard deliberately grounded the ship as an excuse to disperse the crew. Shortly afterward, he surrendered and accepted a royal pardon for himself and his remaining crewmen from Governor Charles Eden at Bath, North Carolina. However, Blackbeard eventually returned to piracy and was killed in combat in November 1718.\n\nIntersal Inc., a private research firm, discovered the wreck believed to be \"Queen Anne’s Revenge\" on November 21, 1996. It was located by Intersal's director of operations, Mike Daniel, who used historical research provided by the company's president, Phil Masters and maritime archaeologist David Moore. The shipwreck lies in 28 feet (8.5 m) of water about one mile (1.6 km) offshore of Fort Macon State Park (34°41′44″N 76°41′20″W), Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. Thirty-one cannons have been identified to date and more than 300,000 artifacts have been recovered. The cannons are of different origins including Sweden, England and possibly France, and of different sizes as would be expected with a colonial pirate crew.\n\nRecognizing the significance of \"Queen Anne's Revenge\", the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (NCDNCR), Intersal, and Maritime Research Institute (MRI) entered into a memorandum of agreement in 1998. Intersal agreed to forego entitlement to any coins and precious metals recovered from the wreck site in order that all artifacts remain as one intact collection, and in order for NCDNCR to determine the ultimate disposition of the artifacts. In return, Intersal was granted media-, replica- and other rights related to an entity known as Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge Shipwreck Project; MRI was granted joint artifact touring rights with NCDNCR. NCDNCR, Intersal, and Rick Allen of Nautilus Productions signed a settlement agreement on October 24, 2013 connected to commercial-, replica- and promotional opportunities for the benefit of \"Queen Anne's Revenge\". The State of North Carolina owns the wreck since it lies in state waters (within the three-mile limit).\n\nFor one week in 2000 and 2001, live underwater video of the project was webcast to the Internet as a part of the \"QAR DiveLive\" educational program that reached thousands of children around the world. Created and co-produced by Nautilus Productions and Marine Grafics, this project enabled students to talk to scientists and learn about methods and technologies utilized by the underwater archaeology team.\n\nIn November 2006 and 2007, more artifacts were discovered at the site and brought to the surface. The additional artifacts appear to support the claim that the wreck is that of \"Queen Anne's Revenge\". Among evidence to support this theory is that the cannons were found loaded. In addition, there were more cannons than would be expected for a ship of this size, and the cannons were of different makes. Depth markings on the part of the stern that was recovered point to it having been made according to the French foot measurements.\n\nBy the end of 2007, approximately one third of the wreck was fully excavated. Part of the hull of the ship, including much of the keel and part of the stern post, has survived. The stern post was recovered in November 2007. The NCDNCR set up the website \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" to build on intense public interest in the finds. Artifacts recovered in 2008 include loose ceramic and pewter fragments, lead strainer fragments, a nesting weight, cannon apron, ballast stones, a sword guard and a coin.\n\nGoals during the 2010 field season included staging of one of the ship's largest main deck cannons to the large artifact holding area on site, taking corrosion readings from anchors and cannon undergoing \"in situ\" corrosion treatment, attaching aluminum-alloy anodes to the remaining anchors and cannons so as to begin their \"in situ\" corrosion treatment and continuing site excavations.\n\nIn 2011, the anchor from the ship was brought to the surface along with a range of makeshift weaponry including langrage or canister shot.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, the National Geographic Society reported that the State of North Carolina had confirmed the shipwreck as \"Queen Anne's Revenge\", reversing a conclusion previously maintained because of a lack of conclusive evidence. Specific artifacts that support this conclusion include a brass coin weight bearing the bust of Queen Anne of England, cast during her reign (1702–1714); the stem of a wine glass decorated with diamonds and tiny embossed crowns, made to commemorate the 1714 coronation of Queen Anne's successor, King George I; the remains of a French hunting sword featuring a bust that closely resembles King Louis XV, who claimed the French throne in 1715; and a urethral syringe for treating venereal diseases with a control mark indicating manufacture between 1707 and 1715 in Paris, France.\n\nOn June 21, 2013, the National Geographic Society reported recovery of two cannons from \"Queen Anne's Revenge\". Several months later, on October 28, archaeologists recovered five more cannons from the wreck. Three of these have been identified as iron 6-pounders manufactured at works in Södermanland, Sweden, in 1713. Thomas Roth, the head of Sweden's Armament Museum Research Department, derived the origin of the iron cannons by a mark on their tubes.\n\nThe 23rd of 31 cannons identified at the wreck site was recovered on October 24, 2014. The gun is approximately long, weighs over and may be a sister to a Swedish gun that was previously recovered. Nine cannonballs, bar shot halves, an iron bolt and a grenado were also recovered during the 2014 field season.\n\nArchaeological recovery ceased on the shipwreck after the 2015 season because of lawsuits filed against the State of North Carolina, the NCDNCR, and the Friends of the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" nonprofit. Intersal, which discovered the \"Queen Anne's Revenge,\" filed suit in state court over contract violations. In a unanimous decision on November 2, 2019, the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed Intersal's complaint and voted to send the lawsuit back to complex business court for reconsideration. Nautilus Productions, the company documenting the recovery since 1998, filed suit in federal court over copyright violations and the passage of \"Blackbeard's Law\" by the North Carolina legislature. On November 5, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in \"Allen v. Cooper\". A decision in the case is expected in the late spring of 2020.\n\nIn January 2018, sixteen fragments of paper were identified after being recovered from sludge inside a cannon. The scraps were from a copy of the book \"A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform'd in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711\" by Captain Edward Cooke, in which Cooke travels under Woodes Rogers; it is likely the pages were torn from the book and used as wadding in that cannon.\n\n\"Queen Anne's Revenge\" was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The reference number is 04000148. It is listed as owned by the State of North Carolina and located near Morehead City. The wreck site is designated 31CR314 by the state of North Carolina.\n\n\n"}

It has a foreword by Timothy Leary, which he wrote in the summer of 1977. The first volume was published without numbering, as the second volume did not appear for nearly 15 years. \n\nWilson is perhaps best known as the co-author of the award-winning science fiction work \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\". \"Cosmic Trigger\" revisits many of the themes from that earlier work in a more autobiographical fashion. After publishing the first volume of \"Cosmic Trigger\", Wilson wrote two sequels, \"\" (1991) and \"\" (1995), the title of the first book retroactively changing to reflect the series.\n\n\"Cosmic Trigger I\" deals with Wilson's experiences during a time in which he put himself through a process of \"self-induced brain change\" as well as vignettes of his earlier life. The main discovery of this process—which, he tells us, is known in certain traditions as Chapel perilous—is that \"reality\" (although a noun in most Indo-European language systems, and therefore commonly conceptualized as being a definite, unchanging \"'thing\") is mutable and subjective to the observer.\n\nWilson employs several models for his experiences, such as the interstellar ESP connection, during which time Wilson enters what he refers to as a 'reality tunnel', in which he claims to communicate telepathically with extraterrestrials residing in the Sirius star system. Wilson states however, that this belief system does not necessarily have any objective truth, which highlights his main point: that all such models—whether spiritual or scientific—are just that: models, or maps, of the world, and they should not be confused with an objective, permanent reality. Throughout the book, he makes references to specific paranormal personal and group experiences, yet he does not allow himself to become convinced of their reality apart from his perception of them. He calls this approach \"model agnosticism\".\n\nThe book also deals with the Bavarian Illuminati conspiracy (which Wilson neither rejects as utterly false nor embraces as true, in keeping with his theme) and other related intrigues. The work also touches on a wide range of other subjects, from Timothy Leary's thoughts on brain circuits and JFK's assassination, through to Sufism and numerous occult practises.\n\n\"Cosmic Trigger\" has been adapted as a theatrical stage play by Daisy Eris Campbell, daughter of Ken Campbell the British theatre maverick who staged \"Illuminatus!\" at the Royal National Theatre in 1977. The new play opened on 23 November 2014 in Liverpool before transferring to London and Brighton. Some of the costs were met through crowdfunding. Wilson's book is itself dedicated to \"Ken Campbell and the Science-Fiction Theatre of Liverpool, England.\"\n\nA new edition of \"Cosmic Trigger I\", edited and with a new introduction by John Higgs, was published by Hilaritas Press on February 23, 2016. Hilaritas Press is the new publishing house created by the Robert Anton Wilson Trust.\n\n\n"}

It forms the western part of the state of Upper Austria and borders the German state of Bavaria. The Innviertel is one of the four traditional \"quarters\" of Upper Austria, the others being Hausruckviertel, Mühlviertel, and Traunviertel.\n\nThe quarter spans the Austrian political districts of Schärding, Ried im Innkreis and Braunau am Inn. Major towns in Innviertel include the district capitals Braunau am Inn, Ried im Innkreis and Schärding as well as Mattighofen and Altheim.\n\nLocated within the Alpine foothills, the rural Innviertel is approximately 2250 km² in area and comprises the broad Inn valley, which is largely flat and fertile, and the adjacent undulating landscape in the east, which is rich in granite in the north and coal.\n\nSince the Early Middle Ages the region had belonged to the German stem duchy of Bavaria and was called \"Innbaiern\". Administered from the town of Burghausen, the lands beyond the Inn river for centuries had two important roles: strategically as an eastern defence line against the rising Archduchy of Austria, and economically as arable land for crop farming. In the course of the Bavarian People's Uprising against the occupation by the Habsburg Emperor Joseph I, the short-lived Braunau Parliament convened in 1705, an early occurrence of a parliamentary system in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nFollowing the War of the Bavarian Succession and the Treaty of Teschen in 1779 it had to be ceded to Austria. During the Napoleonic Wars it was once again restored to Bavaria after the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn, together with the adjacent Hausruckviertel, but finally attached to the Austrian Empire in 1815 according to the Final Act of the Vienna Congress.\n\nToday the Innviertel has about 215,000 people in its towns, villages and hamlets. Its Bavarian roots show in the local German dialect, \"Innviertlerisch\", a Western Central Austro-Bavarian variant similar to the languages spoken in adjacent Lower Bavaria.\n\nInnviertel is the birthplace of Franz Xaver Gruber (the composer of \"Silent Night\"), the opera singer Franz Xaver Gerl, the Schwanthaler family of Baroque sculptors, the SS general Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the beatified conscientious objector Franz Jägerstätter and of the physicist Anton Zeilinger. Both Adolf Hitler and the diplomat Egon Ranshofen-Wertheimer were born in the town of Braunau am Inn on the German border.\n\n"}

Traditionally, its preparation and consumption was an important economizing custom, especially for the rural poor. Particularly, it allowed farmers to use various less-desirable parts of pork, which were made more palatable by being added to a seasoned porridge of groats or flour. The closely related 'Panhas', 'Pannas' or 'Möppkenbrot' are widely known in the whole northwest of Germany; the last variety is a speciality of middle Westphalia.\n\nOriginally, balkenbrij was prepared upon farms at the end of the pig-slaughtering process, in the pot used to cook the swill. It was eaten soon because of its poor shelf life. \n\nIt is traditionally made of stock left over from the making of sausages like liverwurst, boiled with flour (and sometimes blood, which turns the color from white to black) and bacon, together with odd scraps and various organ meats of the animal such as liver, kidney and/or lungs. All of these are cooked, ground, then cooked again with flour (either wheat or buckwheat) or oatmeal, and a special spice mix (\"\") consisting of liquorice, sugar, anise, cinnamon, clove, white pepper, mace, ginger powder and sandalwood, and finally poured into a pan or mold and cooled off to achieve the form of a loaf. The loaf of balkenbrij is then sliced (about 1 cm thick), and the slices are dusted with flour and fried, traditionally in lard.\n\nToday, products for the broad consumer market are specially made of a planned portion of the slaughtered swine (blood, fat, minor muscle meat and sometimes organ meats such as liver or stomach). A staple ingredient in most German versions is pearl barley.\n\nThere are as many recipes as there are Dutch regions, and especially well known is the variety from Gelderland with raisins. Balkenbrij is technically a relative of scrapple, and is claimed as a distant relative of black pudding and Scottish haggis though it does not use a casing, the distinctive feature of haggis.\n\nBalkenbrij was one of the classic foods brought by Dutch settlers to the New World.

{"id": "1939754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939754", "title": "Iron–sulfur protein", "text": "Iron–sulfur protein\n\nIron–sulfur proteins are proteins characterized by the presence of iron–sulfur clusters containing sulfide-linked di-, tri-, and tetrairon centers in variable oxidation states. Iron–sulfur clusters are found in a variety of metalloproteins, such as the ferredoxins, as well as NADH dehydrogenase, hydrogenases, coenzyme Q – cytochrome c reductase, succinate – coenzyme Q reductase and nitrogenase. Iron–sulfur clusters are best known for their role in the oxidation-reduction reactions of electron transport in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Both Complex I and Complex II of oxidative phosphorylation have multiple Fe–S clusters. They have many other functions including catalysis as illustrated by aconitase, generation of radicals as illustrated by SAM-dependent enzymes, and as sulfur donors in the biosynthesis of lipoic acid and biotin. Additionally, some Fe–S proteins regulate gene expression. Fe–S proteins are vulnerable to attack by biogenic nitric oxide, forming dinitrosyl iron complexes. In most Fe–S proteins, the terminal ligands on Fe are thiolate, but exceptions exist.\n\nThe prevalence of these proteins on the metabolic pathways of most organisms leads some scientists to theorize that iron–sulfur compounds had a significant role in the origin of life in the iron–sulfur world theory.\n\nIn almost all Fe–S proteins, the Fe centers are tetrahedral and the terminal ligands are thiolato sulfur centers from cysteinyl residues. The sulfide groups are either two- or three-coordinated. Three distinct kinds of Fe–S clusters with these features are most common.\n\nThe simplest polymetallic system, the [FeS] cluster, is constituted by two iron ions bridged by two sulfide ions and coordinated by four cysteinyl ligands (in FeS ferredoxins) or by two cysteines and two histidines (in Rieske proteins). The oxidized proteins contain two Fe ions, whereas the reduced proteins contain one Fe and one Fe ion. These species exist in two oxidation states, (Fe) and FeFe. CDGSH iron sulfur domain is also associated with 2Fe-2S clusters.\n\nA common motif features a four iron ions and four sulfide ions placed at the vertices of a cubane-type cluster. The Fe centers are typically further coordinated by cysteinyl ligands. The [FeS] electron-transfer proteins ([FeS] ferredoxins) may be further subdivided into low-potential (bacterial-type) and high-potential (HiPIP) ferredoxins. Low- and high-potential ferredoxins are related by the following redox scheme:\n\nIn HiPIP, the cluster shuttles between [2Fe, 2Fe] (FeS) and [3Fe, Fe] (FeS). The potentials for this redox couple range from 0.4 to 0.1 V. In the bacterial ferredoxins, the pair of oxidation states are [Fe, 3Fe] (FeS) and [2Fe, 2Fe] (FeS). The potentials for this redox couple range from −0.3 to −0.7 V. The two families of 4Fe–4S clusters share the FeS oxidation state. The difference in the redox couples is attributed to the degree of hydrogen bonding, which strongly modifies the basicity of the cysteinyl thiolate ligands. A further redox couple, which is still more reducing than the bacterial ferredoxins is implicated in the nitrogenase.\n\nSome 4Fe–4S clusters bind substrates and are thus classified as enzyme cofactors. In aconitase, the Fe–S cluster binds aconitate at the one Fe centre that lacks a thiolate ligand. The cluster does not undergo redox, but serves as a Lewis acid catalyst to convert citrate to isocitrate. In radical SAM enzymes, the cluster binds and reduces S-adenosylmethionine to generate a radical, which is involved in many biosyntheses.\n\nProteins are also known to contain [FeS] centres, which feature one iron less than the more common [FeS] cores. Three sulfide ions bridge two iron ions each, while the fourth sulfide bridges three iron ions. Their formal oxidation states may vary from [FeS] (all-Fe form) to [FeS] (all-Fe form). In a number of iron–sulfur proteins, the [FeS] cluster can be reversibly converted by oxidation and loss of one iron ion to a [FeS] cluster. E.g., the inactive form of aconitase possesses an [FeS] and is activated by addition of Fe and reductant.\n\nMore complex polymetallic systems are common. Examples include both the 8Fe and the 7Fe clusters in nitrogenase. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and the [FeFe]-hydrogenase also feature unusual Fe–S clusters. A special 6 cysteine-coordinated [FeS] cluster was found in oxygen-tolerant membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenases.\n\nThe biosynthesis of the Fe–S clusters has been well studied.\nThe biogenesis of iron sulfur clusters has been studied most extensively in the bacteria \"E. coli\" and \"A. vinelandii\" and yeast \"S. cerevisiae\". At least three different biosynthetic systems have been identified so far, namely nif, suf, and isc systems, which were first identified in bacteria. The nif system is responsible for the clusters in the enzyme nitrogenase. The suf and isc systems are more general. The yeast isc system is the best described. Several proteins constitute the biosynthetic machinery via the isc pathway. The process occurs in two major steps:\n(1) the Fe/S cluster is assembled on a scaffold protein followed by (2) transfer of the preformed cluster to the recipient proteins.\nThe first step of this process occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic organisms or in the mitochondria of eukaryotic organisms. In the higher organisms the clusters are therefore transported out of the mitochondrion to be incorporated into the extramitochondrial enzymes. These organisms also possess a set of proteins involved in the Fe/S clusters transport and incorporation processes that are not homologous to proteins found in prokaryotic systems.\n\nSynthetic analogues of the naturally occurring Fe–S clusters were first reported by Holm and coworkers. Treatment of iron salts with a mixture of thiolates and sulfide affords derivatives such as (EtN)FeS(SCHPh)].\n\n\n\n"}

The enforcement of law and order is typically the role of the police in modern states.\n\nAmong the first modern experiments in civil government took place in 1636 when Roger Williams, a Christian minister, founded the colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. He sought to create a \"wall of separation\" between church and state to prevent corruption of the church and maintain civil order as expounded upon in his 1644 book, \"Bloudy Tenent of Persecution\".\n\nThus three forms of authority may be seen:\n\nIt can also mean the moral power of command, supported (when need be) by physical coercion, which the State exercises over its members. In this view, because man can not live in isolation without being deprived of what makes him human, and because authority is necessary for a society to hold together, the authority has not only the power but the right to command. It is natural to man to live in society, to submit to authority, and to be governed by that custom of society which crystallizes into law, and the obedience that is required is paid to the powers that be, to the authority in possession. The extent of its authority is bound by the ends it has in view, and the extent to which it provides for the government of society.\n\nIn modern states enforcement of law and order is typically the role of the police although the line between military and civil units may be hard to distinguish; especially when militias and volunteers, such as yeomanry, act in pursuance of non-military, domestic objectives.\n\n\n"}

She débuted in 1886 at the Kraków Association of Friends of Fine Arts exhibition. \n\nFrom 1886–1890 she studied art in the private schools of Karl Kricheldorf and Wilhelm Dürr in Munich - as women were not yet permitted at the Munich Academy. From then on she devoted herself mostly to portraits, still lifes and occasionally landscapes. She became well connected within the Polish artistic community of Munich, notably Józef Brandt who became her mentor. Her 1893 \"Portrait of Paul Nauen\" obtained her first public success - being awarded the gold medal at the International Exhibition in Vienna the following year.\n\nIn 1898, she joined the Society of Polish Artists \"Sztuka\" and in the same year moved to Paris, where she became a member of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and started teaching at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and joined the Polish Society of Literature and Art (Polskie Towarzystwo Literacko-Artystyczne). \n\nHer most famous 1894 portrait of an unknown child \"Girl with Chrysanthemums\" fascinated her contemporaries by its symbolist atmosphere and psychological insight. Boznańska received the French Legion of Honour in 1912, the Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature in 1936, the Grand Prix at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques la Vie Moderne in 1937, and the Order of Polonia Restituta in 1938. The same year, at the Venice Biennale, one of her portraits was purchased by King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III. Her paintings can be found in the National Museums in Wrocław, Kraków, Poznań and Warsaw as well as Musée d'Orsay in Paris and Ca' Pesaro – International Gallery of Modern Art in Venice. She died in Paris at the age of 75.\n\n\n"}

It was invented by American chemist Irvine W. Grote in the late 1920s, and originated with manufacturing in Chattanooga, Tennessee under one of Chattem's forerunner companies, which manufactured the brand for Warner-Lambert; Warner-Lambert merged with Pfizer in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, acquired the brand from Pfizer Consumer Healthcare. In 2013, McNeil sold the brand to Sanofi, following a two-year period where the brand was pulled off the market due to product recalls resulting from quality control and manufacturing issues that also left former fellow antacid brand Pepcid AC's \"chewables\" product and other fellow McNeil products like some varieties of Tylenol off store shelves for the same period. Rolaids returned to the market at the beginning of September 2013 under Chattem ownership with new packaging, trade dress, and a new liquid variety.\n\nRolaids tablets come in many different flavors, including original peppermint, cherry, freshmint, fruit, tropical, punch, cool mint, berry, and apple.\n\nMcNeil Consumer Healthcare voluntarily recalled Rolaids products in the Americas, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Fiji on January 15, 2010, in consultation with the FDA. The company initiated the recall following an investigation of consumer reports of an unusual moldy, musty, or mildewlike odor that, in a small number of cases, was associated with temporary and nonserious gastrointestinal events. These events included nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. At that time, the Rolaids website carried the following statement regarding product availability: \"You may have noticed that ROLAIDS® products are not available at your local retailers. We are changing some of our manufacturing facilities where our products are made, a process that will take time to complete. We apologize for the inconvenience this may be causing you. Your health and comfort are important to us, and we assure you we are working hard to get ROLAIDS® product back on store shelves.\"\n\nAnother recall was issued around December 9, 2010, as a result of foreign objects that contained metal and wood particles. The foreign materials were caused by a third-party manufacturer during the production process. Several people complained when they took the product; they also had vomiting, strange taste, and tooth and gum injury. After this recall, beyond the small \"candy aisle\" rolls and chewable lines, the Rolaids line of products was drastically reduced and disappeared from most American retailers until Chattem returned the product to the market in the fall of 2013.\n\nRolaids' best-known commercial from the 1970s featured the famous tag line:\n\nIn connection with the famous slogan, Rolaids sponsored the Major League Baseball award for top relief pitchers called the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award. The award was given yearly from 1976 through 2012.\n\nPfizer released a new version of Rolaids on April 6, 2006, branded \"Extra Strength Rolaids Plus Gas Relief Softchews\". The product was produced as an alternative for people averse to the chalky consistency of regular Rolaids. They were widely advertised in multiple media formats.\n\nRolaids Softchews were originally developed and test marketed in Oklahoma City under the brand name Remegel by Warner Lambert in 1984.\n\nThe active ingredients are calcium carbonate (550 mg) and magnesium hydroxide (110 mg). The inactive ingredients are dextrose, flavoring, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, pregelatinized starch, sucralose and sucrose. The new Chattem varieties have increased the amount of the active ingredients in the product, up to 1000 mg of calcium carbonate and 200 mg of magnesium hydroxide for the \"ultra strength\" varieties.\n\nMinor side effects may include constipation or stomach cramps. Serious side effects include loss of appetite, vomiting, dizziness, and headache.\n"}

{"id": "1939782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939782", "title": "Propositional representation", "text": "Propositional representation\n\nPropositional representation is the psychological theory, first developed in 1973 by Dr. Zenon Pylyshyn, that mental relationships between objects are represented by symbols and not by mental images of the scene.\n\nA propositional network describing the sentence \"John believes that Anna will pass her exam\" is illustrated below.\n\nEach circle represents a single proposition, and the connections between the circles describe a network of propositions.\n\nAnother example is the sentence \"Debby donated a big amount of money to Greenpeace, an organisation which protects the environment\", which contains the propositions \"Debby donated money to Greenpeace\", \"The amount of money was big\" and \"Greenpeace protects the environment\". If one or more of the propositions is false, the whole sentence is false. This is illustrated in Figure 2:\n\nPropositional representations are also:\n\n\nEach proposition consists of a set of predicates and arguments which are represented in the form of predicate calculus. For instance:\n\nAn event; (X) John hit Chris with a unicycle, the unicycle broke, because of this John started to cry, which caused Chris to be happy.\n\n\"A propositional representation\"\n\n\nEach set of predicates (words like hit, broke, cry, happy are first order-predicates; Cause is a second-order predicate) and arguments (often consisting of an agent/subject (e.g. John in ‘P’), a recipient/object (e.g. Chris in ‘P’) and an instrument (e.g. the unicycle in ‘P’)) are in turn manipulated as propositions: event/statement “John hit Chris with the unicycle” is represented as proposition ‘P’.\n\nAlso, features of particular objects may be characterized through attribute lists. ‘John’ as a singular object may have the attributes ‘plays guitar’, ‘juggles’, ‘eats a lot’, ‘rides a unicycle’ etc. Thus reference to ‘John’ identifies him as the object of thought in virtue of his having certain of these attributes. So in predicate calculus, if “John (F) has the property of being ‘rides a unicycle’ (x)” we may say salva veritate: (x)(Fx). These elements have been called semantic primitives or semantic markers/features. Each primitive may in turn form part of a propositional statement, which in turn could be represented by an abstract figure e.g. ‘P’. The primitives themselves play a crucial role in categorizing and classifying objects and concepts.\n\nThe meaningful relations between ideas and concepts expressed between and within the propositions are in part dealt with through the general laws of inference. One of the most common of these is Modus Ponens Ponendum (MPP), which is a simple inference of relation between two objects, the latter supervening on the former (P-›Q). Thus if we have two propositions (P, Q) and we assume a law of inference that relates to them both (P-›Q), then if we have P we must necessarily have Q. Relations of causation and may be expressed in this fashion, i.e. one state (P) causing (-›) another (Q)\n\nSo a purely formal characterization of the event (X) written above in natural language would be something like:\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"The Rebels\", the team competes in the National League South, the sixth tier of English football, following promotion from the Southern League at the end of the 2017-18 season.\n\nThe history of the club began in 1890 when three teams Swifts, Slough Albion and Young Men's Friendly Society formed a new club, Slough F.C., between them. The team initially played in the Southern Alliance alongside the likes of Tottenham Hotspur and Windsor & Eton before later moving on to the Great Western Suburban League. In 1921 it attempted to join the Isthmian League but lost out to Wycombe Wanderers in the voting. Instead Slough chose to join the Spartan League.\n\nIn 1936 the owners of the club's ground, The Dolphin Stadium, sold up to a greyhound racing consortium, which ordered the football club to vacate the stadium three years later. After being forced to groundshare with Maidenhead United for several years, the club agreed to a merge with Slough Centre F.C. to return to a ground in their home town. The new club took the name Slough United F.C.\n\nAfter The Second World War Slough Utd was reluctant to rejoin the Spartan League and led a breakaway movement to form a new league, which became the Corinthian League. It was from this that the club derived its nickname of \"The Rebels\". Shortly after this the two clubs which had merged to form Slough United separated once again, with the former Slough F.C. continuing under the new name of Slough Town F.C.\n\nSlough Town won the Corinthian League in 1950–51 but in 1964 the league folded and Slough, along with many other former Corinthian clubs, joined an expanded Athenian League. The Rebels were champions of this league on three occasions, with the third win earning promotion to the Isthmian League in 1973. During the 1980s they were league champions on two occasions, the second of which brought promotion to the Football Conference. Slough lasted four seasons at this level, were relegated back to the Isthmian League, bounced back at the first attempt, and then played three more seasons of Conference football. In 1998 the consortium which had bought the club out of receivership seven years earlier decided that they were not prepared to pay for ground improvements required to remain in the Conference, and so the club was demoted back to the Isthmian League despite having finished in 8th place.\n\nFurther relegation to the Isthmian League Division One followed in 2000–01 but the club regained its Premier Division status in 2003–04 and remained there until the end of the 2006–07 season, when they finished bottom and conceded over 120 goals. In the 2004–05 season, Slough knocked Walsall of Football League One out of the FA Cup. Highlights of the game were shown on Match of the Day, though because of the team sharing the Stag Meadow ground at the time, the programme showed overhead shots of Windsor instead of Slough when introducing the rarely featured team. Slough transferred over to the Southern Football League Division One South & West for the 2007–08 season, where they finished 21st out of 22 teams. Although initially relegated (for the second year running), they were one of the teams given a provisional reprieve after Halifax Town went into administration.\n\nIn the season of 2004–05 Slough Town beat Walsall to reach the 2nd round of the FA Cup however they then lost to Yeading. Slough Town were also the Isthmian League Cup winners in 2004–05 after they beat Hampton & Richmond Borough 3–1 in the final with 2 goals from Ian Hodges and 1 from Josias Carbon to help them secure the win and the silverware.\n\nOver the next two seasons, and now playing in the Southern Football League Division One Midlands, Slough's performance continued to improve. In the 2009–10 season, Slough Town finish 5th in the table, qualifying the team for the promotion play-off matches. Having beaten second-placed Hitchin Town 2–1 in the play-off semi-final, Slough lost 4–0 to Chesham United in the final, meaning they had to remain in the same division for the 2010–11 season. Once again they finished 5th in the 2010–11 season, but lost to Hitchin Town in the play-off semi-final 4–1.\n\nHaving come close to promotion to the Premier Division in the last few seasons, including two play-off final defeats, Slough parted company with manager Steve Bateman following the 2012–13 season after four years at the helm, the last of which saw them miss out on the play-offs by a solitary point. The club looked to take a new direction in 2013–14 and appointed Neil Baker and Jon Underwood, the management duo who had taken league rivals Godalming Town to the play-offs in the previous season. With Godalming forced to relocate to the South & West Division following their failure to win the play-offs, the majority of their squad decided to follow Baker and Underwood to Slough. In their very first season, the new management team steered the club to promotion via the play-offs. Slough claimed a 3-0 victory at Rugby Town in the semi-final before winning the play-off final against Kettering Town in front of 2,331 at Kettering's home of Latimer Park on 5 May 2014. Slough trailed 0-2 at half-time before staging a second half comeback. Two goals from Johnnie Dyer brought the Rebels level before James McClurg scored the goal that ultimately returned Slough Town to the third tier of non-league football after several years away.\n\nThe 2017-18 season was one of their best for many years. In December they reached the second round of the FA Cup against Rochdale at home. The game was televised by BT Sport and Slough lost 4-0. With records broken for points attained and goals scored they went on to finish 3rd in the league. Slough were in play off action again. After a home 3-1 win against Kettering Town they played away to King's Lynn Town in the final. By virtue of an 89th-minute winner from Manny Williams, they won 2-1 and thus secured promotion to the National League South for the forthcoming season.\n\nSlough Town started the 2016-17 season playing their early home games at Holloways Park, Windsor Road, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. They moved back into the borough of Slough for the first time in over a decade on 29 August 2016 when they played their first game at the new ground, Arbour Park, against Hayes and Yeading United, winning 2-1.\n\nThe pitch at Arbour Park is 3G and has been approved by FIFA, one of only 24 to be so in the UK.\n\nFor many years since the 1930s, Slough Town played at the Dolphin Stadium, just to the east of the town centre. From 1973 Slough Town played at the Wexham Park Stadium. At the end of the 2002–03 season, financial disagreements with the stadium's owners led to the club's eviction. The Stadium is still in existence, but has since fallen into a state of serious disrepair. During the next four seasons (2003–04 to 2006–07) the club was based in Windsor, ground-sharing with Windsor & Eton at their Stag Meadow ground. In the summer of 2007, the club agreed a three-year ground-share with Beaconsfield SYCOB. This was extended to cover the 2010–11 season, and continued until Slough moved into their new ground, Arbour Park, on 29 August 2016.\n\nIn June 2009, Slough Town made a proposal that was submitted to Slough Borough Council for permission to build a new stadium within the Borough of Slough. The proposed location for the development was the Arbour Vale school site on Stoke Road, to the north of the town. In addition to a state-of-the-art stadium, the plans included affordable housing and sports fields. An artist's impression of the new ground was released in March 2012. In 2018, after opening two years prior, Arbour Park hosted a number of games in the 2018 CONIFA World Football Cup.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}

The reason for this correction is partly that the rate of rotation of the Earth is not constant, due to tidal braking and the redistribution of mass within the Earth, including its oceans and atmosphere, and partly because the SI second (as now used for UTC) was already, when adopted, a little shorter than the current value of the second of mean solar time.\n\nForecast values of DUT1 are published by IERS Bulletin A.\n\nWeekly updated values of DUT1 with 0.1 s precision are broadcast by several time signal services, including WWV and MSF. These services transmit one pulse per second of some sort. To represent positive DUT1 values from +0.1 to +0.8 seconds, the pulses sent during seconds 1 through 8 are \"emphasized\" in some way, generally by transmitting a double pulse. The number of emphasized pulses gives the value of DUT1. Negative DUT1 values, from −0.1 to −0.8 seconds, are similarly represented by emphasizing pulses 9 through 16.

Le Banner fought for most of his career in K-1 and became known for his aggressive fighting style and knockout power. He holds notable victories over Ernesto Hoost (twice), Francisco Filho, Mark Hunt (three times), Sam Greco, Mike Bernardo (twice), Peter Aerts, Rick Roufus, Remy Bonjasky, Tyrone Spong, and Stefan Leko.\n\nJérôme Le Banner was born in the French city of Le Havre, in the \"région\" of Normandy and began training in judo at the age of five. When he was fourteen, Bruce Lee's \"Fist of Fury\" influenced him so much that he became interested in striking instead and started trying to incorporate the techniques of Jeet Kune Do he had seen in the film. At sixteen however he started practicing kyokushin, while Jeet Kune Do gave him the southpaw stance which he has maintained throughout his career, even though he is right-handed. He eventually took up Muay Thai at the age of 18. Le Banner holds a black belt in the Kyokushin Kaikan karate and in judo.\n\nAt the age of 18, he debuted in his first full contact kickboxing competitions. By 19 he held the ISKA French title and soon after that, he won the European belt against Andy Mayo, and the Intercontinental belt in South Africa against Mike Bernardo. He turned down the chance to fight Richard Vince for the IKL World Kickboxing title at the age of 21.\n\nOn March 3, 1995, Jerome Le Banner made his K-1 debut, winning a five-round decision over Nokweed Davy. Le Banner was at 107 kg while Nokweed was at 74 kg. Two months later, on May 4, 1995 he made his first K-1 World Grand Prix appearance in Tokyo, Japan, knocking out both Masaaki Satake and Mike Bernardo, before losing to Peter Aerts in the tournament finals.\n\nAfter the 1995 K-1 GP, Le Banner was drafted by the French Army, and also had trouble with his trainer so he could not train for a year. His conscription ended in April 1996. He also hired a new trainer.\n\nOn June 1, 1996 in Paris, Le Banner won the ISKA Muay Thai World Super Heavyweight Championship against Curtis Schuster.\n\nOn October 18, K-1 Star Wars '96, Le Banner beat Ernesto Hoost via second-round knockout.\n\nDuring 1997 Le Banner had trouble with his trainer again. As a result, Le Banner contracted former Christophe Tiozzo's promoter Jean-Christophe Courrèges. In 1998, Le Banner contracted boxing promoter Don King and well-known boxing trainer Don Turner. He was training with Evander Holyfield.\n\nOn July 18, K-1 DREAM '98, Le Banner fought against Sam Greco. Le Banner was knocked down in the first round but managed to knock Greco out in the second round.\n\nOn September 19, Le Banner fought in Evander Holyfield vs Vaughn Bean's undercard. Le Banner beat Espedito da Silva via first-round knockout by high kick, to become WKN Muay Thai world super heavyweight champion.\n\nLe Banner's pro boxing record was 6 fights, 6 wins, 5 KOs, 1 win by DQ. He was supposed to fight under boxing rules in the Madison Square Garden on February and March 1999, but had trouble with Don King about his contract so these matches were cancelled by King.\n\nLe Banner could not fight both kickboxing and boxing due to contract problems. In 1999, K-1 producer Kazuyoshi Ishii solved his contract problem so that he could return to K-1.\n\nOn October 3, K-1 World Grand Prix '99 Opening Round, Le Banner fought against Matt Skelton. Skelton became pro boxing WBA world Heavyweight title contender, WBO world Heavyweight number 5 contender. Skelton had never been knocked down by punches in his fighting career but Le Banner dominated Skelton with his boxing skills and knocked out Skelton in the first round.\n\nOn December 5, at the Tokyo Dome, K-1 Grand Prix '99 Final Round, Le Banner fought against three-time defending K-1 GP champion Peter Aerts in the Quarter Final. Le Banner wanted to have Aerts as his opponent in the tournament draw. Le Banner was knocked down by Aerts's high kick but managed to knock out Aerts by left hook at 1:11 of the first round. In the semifinal, Le Banner fought Ernesto Hoost. Le Banner dominated Hoost in the first round but lost by KO in the second round.\n\nOn April 23, 2000 at K-1 The Millennium, Le Banner fought against Kyokushin World Open Karate Tournament 1999 champion Francisco Filho. Just 1 year before from this match, Filho had beat 1999 K-1 GP champion Ernesto Hoost by knockout. But Le Banner knocked out Filho unconscious with a left straight punch in the first round. This knock out is called \"The biggest KO of this thousand years\" (or the Millennium KO) by the ringside announcers and Japanese media. Le Banner's left arm and left punch have been called the \"Golden Left\" since this match.\n\nOn July 30, Le Banner beat Mark Hunt, Nicholas Pettas and Ernesto Hoost, to become K-1 World Grand Prix 2000 in Nagoya tournament Champion. But he was not able to fight in K-1 World Grand Prix 2000 Final due to illness from Infectious mononucleosis.\n\nOn April 29, 2001, Le Banner won the K-1 World Grand Prix tournament by three first-round KOs, the fastest win in K-1 history in a total time of 4 minutes and 4 seconds in K-1 World Grand Prix 2001 in Osaka.\n\nOn December 8, Le Banner lost to Mark Hunt by KO in K-1 World Grand Prix 2001 Final Quarter Finals. The match is one of the biggest upsets ever in K-1. After this event, Japanese combat sports magazine SRS-DX published a picture of the moment Hunt hit Le Banner's face with an elbow; however, this didn't change the match's result into disqualification.\n\nIn 2002, Le Banner had begun to train with Stéphane Nikiéma.\nOn May 25, 2002, Le Banner fought Mark Hunt at K-1 World Grand Prix 2002 in Paris in a rubber match.

{"id": "1939818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939818", "title": "CHERUB", "text": "CHERUB\n\nCHERUB () is a series of teenage spy novels written by English author Robert Muchamore, focusing around a division of the British Security Service called CHERUB, which employs children, predominantly orphans, under the age of 17, as intelligence agents.\n\nInitially, the series follows James Choke, better known as James Adams (his adopted name at CHERUB), as he enters CHERUB and performs various missions. However, the focus later expands to other characters, such as James' sister Lauren and several other characters who work alongside him and in separate missions. The initial series of twelve novels runs from the recruitment of Adams to his retirement from CHERUB at age seventeen. The second series of five novels, Aramov, follows Ryan Sharma, another CHERUB agent; James Adams is re-introduced into the series as a CHERUB staff member.\n\nMuchamore also wrote a seven-part series called Henderson's Boys, which takes place during World War II and explains how CHERUB was created, following the path of a twelve-year-old French orphan named Marc Kilgour who meets Charles Henderson and shows him how much help children can be to win the war. Henderson, following this, creates a small unit of children to be trained in espionage.\n\nThe series has achieved great critical success. Christopher Middleton of \"The Times\" called the series \"convincing\" and praised the way it allows readers to \"grow up with the characters.\" After release in the United Kingdom, the novels have been released in the US, New Zealand, and Australia, and translated into several languages including Polish, French, Danish, Spanish, Russian, Czech, Norwegian and Portuguese. On his website, Muchamore states that over 8 million copies have now been sold. A film adaptation was hinted at in 2009, but no further information was ever given. In 2018, Sony announced they were developing a TV series based on the CHERUB books.\nThe first series primarily follows James Adams, a twelve-year-old boy who is later joined at CHERUB by his sister Lauren, after their mother dies after consuming alcohol while taking painkillers.\n\nAfter the death of his mother, James Choke joins CHERUB. With the help of fellow trainee, Kerry Chang- he passes basic training. Meanwhile, James' half-sister Lauren Onions joins CHERUB following the imprisonment of her father, Ron. A couple of months later, James goes on a mission to Wales to thwart an attack on an oil conference by eco-terrorist group Help Earth.\n\nTitled \"The Dealer\" in the United States and \"The Mission\" for 5,000 copies. James, Kyle, Kerry, Nicole, and mission controllers Zara and Ewart Asker help to take down the cocaine supplier gang KMG. They move into a house on the same estate as Keith Moore and his children. James' duty is to befriend the head of KMG's son, Junior Moore, to attempt to get valuable information on his father's illegal activities. Things take an unexpected turn and a trip to Keith's holiday home in Miami is in order. \n\nMany CHERUB missions have resulted in criminals being put behind bars, but one is now scheduled for James and Dave to bust someone out. James and Dave go undercover inside a maximum security prison in Arizona to break out Curtis Oxford, the son of an illegal arms dealer. Their hope is that Curtis will lead them to her.\n\nJames and Dave go to find out why a small-time crook called Leon Tarasov suddenly appears to become extremely rich, and they uncover a plot much larger than a robbery: the murder of Will Clarke.\n\nJames, Lauren and Dana investigate a religious cult named The Survivors in Australia with suspected links to an eco-terrorist organisation Help Earth.\n\nJames, Lauren and Kyle infiltrate a pro-animal rights terrorist group.\n\nWhen a mission in Russia goes wrong, James tries to clear his name after being implicated in the deaths of two MI5 agents, while Lauren goes on a mission to expose a sex slave trafficking gang.\n\nJames and Bruce infiltrate a gang tussling with rivals for control of the Luton underworld after the collapse of KMG. \n\nJames' sister Lauren and Jake Parker go undercover to befriend a boy who claims that his father is responsible for a deadly plane crash in the Atlantic. Meanwhile James is put into an uncomfortable situation as he is forced to do work experience with his ex girlfriend\n\nJames, Lauren, and other CHERUB agents join the SAS and play insurgents in a US army training exercise in Las Vegas. However the odds are stacked against them and only a master plan from Cherub instructor Yosyp Kazakov can win the war for the Brits. Kazakov and James also cheat casinos to win a lot of money.\n\nJames, Lauren and Dante Scott infiltrate a violent biker gang called the Brigands M.C trying to incriminate their ruthless leader for arms dealing charges and to avenge the deaths of Dante’s family years before.\n\nJames turns down a final mission at CHERUB guarding a politician, instead helping his best friend Kyle Blueman to expose the politician's wrongdoings.\n\nThis series involves an almost completely new cast of CHERUB agents, centred upon Ryan Sharma. However, characters from the original series appear occasionally. The first three books focus on a mission to dismantle the fictional Aramov Clan. As of December 2016, five novels have been announced.\n\nRyan investigates (and befriends) a young boy called Ethan whose extended family are the leaders of a Kyrgyzstan-based terrorist group known as the Aramov Clan.\n\nRyan is tasked with destroying the Aramov Clan after Ethan is kidnapped by his uncle who seeks to take over the business \n\nRyan has to stop the biggest terrorist attack in US history as Aramov operations wind down, and James Adams returns to CHERUB campus. Meanwhile The Tfu find a way to stop Leonid once and for all and it’s up to James and Leonids ex wife and son to put a stop to the ruthless mobster before he disappears forever.\n\nRyan infiltrates a drug gang. Ning befriends Fay, a girl whose mother was murdered by the gang and may have vital information on how the organisation works.\n\n\"New Guard\" is the final novel in the CHERUB series.It features characters from both the first and second CHERUB series in one big mission to rescue two hostages from the Islamic state in a high stakes mission to end all.\n\nReleased for World Book Day, Rat and Andy go undercover to befriend a boy whose father is a member of Dark Sun, a criminal organisation dealing in nuclear weapons technology. Chronologically, the story fits in between \"The Sleepwalker\" and \"The General\".\n\n\"CHERUB: Ultimate Edition\" consists of a map of CHERUB campus, a biography of Muchamore, and the novels \"The Recruit\" and \"Class A\".\n\n\"The Recruit\" was released as a graphic novel, illustrated by Ian Edginton and John Aggs.\n\nThe \"CHERUB\" novels have been released in twenty-seven countries to date.\n\nThe series' main location is CHERUB campus, the headquarters of the fictional titular British government agency CHERUB for which the children work. It was formed during World War II by Charles Henderson; a British spy who had used children during an operation in France. It is populated by around 350 adolescents and children, who live on the campus when not on a mission to help the police. No-one in the world knows where CHERUB campus is situated except its employees, members and certain police and high level members of the British government.\n\nCHERUB began with a small number of boys which swelled in size as the government realised its worth. After several years of operation it took in a trial group of girls, which proved successful. Since then CHERUB campus has grown a significant amount, improving many of its facilities. The dojo was built on behalf of a successful operation that took place in Japan and the new mission preparation building was built by the chairman of the first 6 novels, Dr. McAfferty, better known as Mac. After retiring at the end of \"Man Vs Beast\", he is replaced by Zara Asker, who holds the role for ten years until stepping down to be replace by husband Ewart Asker shortly before \"New Guard\".\n\nAfter years of speculation, Muchamore said in the Henderson's Boys novel \"Eagle Day\" that CHERUB stood for Charles Henderson Espionage Research Unit B; this was later confirmed in \"Secret Army\" by Eileen McAfferty in a telegram.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939821", "title": "Faust (Guilty Gear)", "text": "Faust (Guilty Gear)\n\nHis unpaired appearance and personality has led to different commentaries by video game reviewers; while a reviewer described him as \"iconic\", another critic called Faust \"goofy\". Faust was also noted to be a good fighting game character while his moves received both praise and criticism.\n\nFaust is introduced in the series' first and homonymous installment of \"Guilty Gear\", where he is a renowned physician. His medical prowess and healing power was the envy of other physicians, who cause the death of a girl who is under his medical treatments. Faust blames himself and, consumed by guilt, becomes insane and turns himself into a serial killer named Dr. Baldhead. After killing millions of people, he is arrested. However, he is allowed to enter in a tournament to kill more people unknowingly for Justice's resurrection. After it, he decides to atone for his crimes by committing suicide but he receives a visit from the ghost of the dead girl who tells him that her death is not his fault. Then, he abandons his Baldhead persona, assumes his real name, puts paper bag on his head, and dedicates himself to saving as many lives as he can while he tries to find out the truth about the girl's death.\n\nIn \"Guilty Gear X\" (2000), while Faust is trying to help people and fulfilling his duties as a doctor, he meets with Dizzy and persuades her to abandon her life in the forest to prevent further attacks on her. In another possible ending, he heals Zato-1 from his illness, and leaves him under the care of his right hand Venom. In \"Guilty Gear X2\" (2002), he wants to pursue I-No since he knows she could cause people harm. This game features three possible endings for Faust: he finds I-No but she confronts him with his past, and he admits that he still enjoys causing pain, yet vows to continue in his duty as a doctor; he meets Zappa, a man with spirits in his body, and he does not know how to help him; and in a fight alongside Venom against several Robo-Kys, he discovers that the Assassin's Guild participated in the death of the young girl he thought he killed. In \"Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus\" (2008), Faust's storyline revolves around his attempt to find a cure for Zappa's condition. Depending on the player's decision, he can discover a cure and perform surgery on Zappa.\n\nIn \"Guilty Gear Xrd\" (2014), Faust confronted the resurrected Zato-1, who revealed that he was framed for his malpractice incident by the Conclave because his procedure held the secret of resurrection. The Conclave needed to keep this technique hidden, which is why they hired Zato-1 to kill Faust's patient. Later, Faust is found by Johnny, who revealed that May was having a severe headache and that she was Japanese. He provided May with medicine for the pain, but they were then attacked by Bedman. Faust and the Jellyfish Pirates were able to escape when Chipp Zanuff distracted the assassin. After helping Sol in stopping Justice's revival, Faust confronted Chronus of the Conclave and discovered that they were merely manipulated by someone with a higher authority.\n\nFaust is also a playable character in the spin-off games \"Guilty Gear Petit 2\" (2002), \"Isuka\" (2004), \"Dust Strikers\" (2006), and \"Judgment\" (2006).\n\nFaust has received public and critical reception as a standout character in the \"Guilty Gear\" series due to his appearance and unconventional in-game behavior. He was voted the twelfth-most popular out of the series' 33 characters in a 2013 fan poll conducted by Arc System Works, while fans voted him 91st in a vote of the top 100 fictional doctors in a 2014 poll held by Dorkly. GamesRadar described him as \"a spear equipped monkey kung-fu warrior replete with a paper bag on his head\", and included Faust in their list of \"gaming's maddest mad doctors\", and \"gaming's masked maniacs\", where they remarked \"his moves took on a more comedic tone\" after renouncing his Baldhead persona. IGN compared him to \"Soul\" series character Voldo, adding that he \"has enough humorous patterns to keep you entertained for days.\" Mark Smith of \"Game Chronicles\" praised the representation of Faust's personality in his moveset, which \"The Escapist\" described as \"full of wild lunges and sudden extensions\" in a 2010 article about \"masters of drunken combat\", but criticized by \"NowGamer\" as his \"fool attacks\".\n\nJohnny Liu of Game Revolution cited Faust as his favorite \"Guilty Gear\" character, declaring that he \"really personifies the quirkiness\" of \"Guilty Gear X2\". \"Pocket Gamer\" described him as \"one of the best creations in 2D scrap-'em-ups history.\" In 2010, WeDoTech.net ranked Faust as the best fighting video game character of all time, calling him \"iconic, funny and possessing of one of the meanest weapons in the business\" while \"his bizarre moves ... without doubt make him the single best fighting character in any video game.\" Elton Jones of \"Complex\" ranked Faust (\"a beast on the battlefield\") 42nd in his 2012 selection of \"The 50 Most Dominant Fighting Game Characters\", and in pitching a fantasy crossover fighting game between the \"Guilty Gear\" characters and the cast of \"Darkstalkers\", he wrote, \"All the horror movie archetypes and whatever the hell Faust is would look sweet doing battle against each other with heavy metal playing in the background.\"\n\nUGO Networks ranked his \"Instant Kill\" finisher (\"which involves medical experiments, a trap door, and a nuclear bomb\") as the 36th-most gruesome finishing move in gaming history, while \"Complex\" elected it the third-coolest fighting game combo. On the other hand, he was mentioned with I-No and Millia among the series' \"goofy characters\" by 1UP.com. Faust's third \"Guilty Gear X2\" ending was ranked 133rd by 4thletter.net in their 2013 selection of the top 200 fighting game endings. \"It’s the closest the games have come to outright saying that [Faust and Dr. Baldhead are] the same character, as if being a 9-foot-tall doctor with a giant scalpel wasn’t enough.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1939823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939823", "title": "Battle of Vinegar Hill", "text": "Battle of Vinegar Hill\n\nThe Battle of Vinegar Hill (\"Irish\": Cath Chnoc Fhíodh na gCaor), was an engagement during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 on 21 June 1798 when over 13,000 British soldiers launched an attack on Vinegar Hill outside Enniscorthy, County Wexford, the largest camp and headquarters of the Wexford United Irishmen. It marked a turning point in the rebellion, as it was the last attempt by the United Irishmen to hold and defend ground against the British military. The battle was actually fought in two locations: on Vinegar Hill itself and in the streets of nearby Enniscorthy.\n\nBy 18 June, the British had surrounded county Wexford with between 13,000 and 18,000 troops and were ready to pour into Wexford to crush the insurgency. The United Irishmen leadership issued a call to all its fighters to gather at Vinegar Hill to meet the army in one great, decisive battle. The number assembled was estimated at between 16,000 and 20,000, but the majority lacked firearms and had to rely on pikes as their main weapon. The camp also included many thousands of women and children who were staying there for protection against the rampaging military.\n\nThe British plan, as formulated by General Gerard Lake, envisaged the complete annihilation of the United Irishmen, Women and Children by encircling the hill and seizing the only escape route to the west, the bridge over the Slaney. Lake divided his force into four columns to accomplish this; three columns, under Generals Dundas, Duff and Needham were to assault Vinegar Hill, while the fourth column, under General Johnson, was to storm Enniscorthy and its bridge.\n\nThe battle began shortly before dawn with an artillery bombardment of Irish positions on the hill. Advance units quickly moved against the United Irishmen outposts under cover of the bombardment and moved artillery closer as forward positions were secured. The tightening ring forced the United Irishmen into an ever-shrinking area and increased exposure to the constant bombardment, including new experimental delayed-fuse shells (called Shrapnel's shells; later known as shrapnel shell) resulting in hundreds of dead and injured. At least two mass charges were launched by the United Irishmen which failed to break the lines of the military and the situation on Vinegar Hill soon became desperate for the United Irishmen.\n\nMeanwhile, a detachment of light infantry under the command of General Johnson attacked the town of Enniscorthy but met with fierce resistance. Buildings in the town had been fortified, and the initial attack was driven back, with the loss of munitions and men. A second attack commenced with reinforcements including cavalry, which retook the lost cannon and ammunition while also incurring considerable casualties. The United Irishmen were slowly driven out of the town but managed to hold the Slaney bridge and prevent the British from crossing.\n\nWhen British troops crested the eastern summit of Vinegar Hill, the rebels began to slowly withdraw through a gap in the British lines later known as \"Needham's Gap\", so-named because the late arrival of General Needham's troops prevented a total encirclement of the hill. Although the bulk of the United Irishmen army escaped, many were left behind and killed in the routing phase of the battle, from both cavalry and infantry attack, but also from the advanced field guns which were switched to grape shot to maximize casualties.\n\nIn addition to conventional casualties, there were also instances of rape of females amongst the United Irishmen and in Enniscorthy, United Irishmen wounded were burned to death when soldiers set fire to a building used as a casualty station. These atrocities may have been perpetrated in revenge for the execution by the United Irishmen of numbers of (mostly Protestant) loyalist prisoners of war in the preceding weeks. The United Irishmen abandoned much of the supplies they had taken from surrounding areas, and thirteen cannons were captured by the British, a number of which had been taken from the British forces previously.\nMeanwhile, the bulk of the United Irishmen force streamed unmolested towards the Three Rocks camp outside Wexford town and, following the decision to abandon the town, split into two separate columns in a new campaign to spread the rebellion beyond Wexford. One immediately set out to the west, the other northwards towards the Wicklow Mountains to link up with General Joseph Holt's forces.\n\nThe defeat was therefore not the immediate crushing blow to the Wexford United Irishmen that it has falsely been depicted as, but it did alter the course of the fighting as continued resistance now took the form of mobile warfare, raids, and large scale, guerilla-type operations.\n\nMurphy was subsequently captured near Tullow, County Carlow and hanged. Casualties for the United Irishmen have been variously reported, with estimates ranging from 400 to around 1,200. Kevin Whelan estimates a figure of between 500 and 1,000 including camp followers, while Archibald McLaren, a British soldier eyewitness, wrote that the United Irishmen casualties totalled about 1,200 men. British casualties were around 100.\nThe Battle of Vinegar Hill and the atrocities that occurred in its wake are depicted in the 2015 American musical \"Guns of Ireland\".\n\nIn his poem \"Requiem For the Croppies\" Seamus Heaney depicts Vinegar Hill as 'the fatal conclave' where the hopes of the rebels were finally crushed, but his final line shows the barley in the pockets of the dead buried in mass graves growing up out of their pockets, symbolizing that their dreams of independence live on. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939833", "title": "Nokia 770 Internet Tablet", "text": "Nokia 770 Internet Tablet\n\nThe Nokia 770 Internet Tablet is a wireless Internet appliance from Nokia, originally announced at the LinuxWorld Summit in New York City on 25 May 2005. It is designed for wireless Internet browsing and e-mail functions and includes software such as Internet radio, an RSS news reader, ebook reader, image viewer and media players for selected types of media.\n\nThe device went on sale in Europe on 3 November 2005, at a suggested retail price of €349 to €369 (£245 in the United Kingdom). In the United States, the device became available for purchase through Nokia USA's web site on 14 November 2005 for $359.99. On 8 January 2007, Nokia announced the Nokia N800, the successor to the 770. In July 2007, the price for the Nokia 770 fell to under US$150 / 150 EUR / 100 GBP.\n\n\nThe device was manufactured in Estonia and Germany.\n\nThe 770, like all Nokia Internet Tablets, runs Maemo, which is similar to many handheld operating systems and provides a \"Home\" screen—the central point from which all applications and settings are accessed. The home screen is divided into areas for launching applications, a menu bar, and a large customisable area that can display information such as an RSS reader, Internet radio player, and Google search box, for example. Maemo is a modified version of Debian.\n\nThe 770 is bundled with applications including the Opera web browser, Macromedia Flash and Gizmo.\n\nA critical bug has been identified that causes memory corruption when using the WLAN connection. This could result in system instability and data corruption. Owners of the 770 are encouraged to apply the bugfix; preferably before having used the WLAN connection for the first time.\n\nBecause of the Linux-based operating system and the open-source contributions from Nokia, the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet has a great appeal to the hacker and DIY markets. Programmers are porting applications to the Maemo platform, allowing a much more rapidly growing application catalog than other mobile platforms would enjoy. The inclusion of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB host functionality (through a hack) permits enthusiasts to expand their tablets to include USB mass storage, Bluetooth GPS receivers, a normal USB keyboard, or other devices.\n\nThe Nokia 770 has received criticism from some technology reviewers. The most common complaint was about the overall speed of the system, due to the relatively slow CPU and the size of the on-board memory (64 MiB). Short battery life (less than 4 hours in the case of continuous Wi-Fi usage) was also a concern. Some reviews suggested problems with the handwriting recognition, and some said tapping the on-screen keyboard was too slow.\n\nAnother common complaint was that it lacked the functions of a mobile PDA, although there are now several PIM options created by the community. Also, for Internet access away from Wi-Fi hotspots, the Nokia 770 relies upon a Bluetooth 1.2 phone acting as a modem, and not all bluetooth phones will work with the tablet. Additionally, some complained that the device used Reduced-Size MMC (RS-MMC or Micro-MMC) cards that were originally difficult to find. However, the format has since been used in other products and has become widely available. The device originally could only use cards up to 1 GB, but 2 GB cards are supported with the current version of the operating system.\n\n\n\n"}

The Swedish exclamation \"ojdå\" is similar in meaning and usage.\n\nIn Norwegian, \"uff\" or \"huff\" is an interjection used when something is unpleasant, uncomfortable, hurtful, annoying, sad, or irritating. \"Uff da\" is most often used as a response when hearing something lamentable (but not too serious), and could often be translated as \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that\".\n\n\"Uff da\" can be used as an expression of surprise, astonishment, exhaustion, relief and sometimes dismay. Within Scandinavian-American culture, \"Uff da\" frequently translates to: \"I am overwhelmed\", somewhat similar to the Yiddish phrase \"oy vey\". \"Uff da\" can often be used as an alternative for many common obscenities.\nThe phrase has become a marker of Scandinavian heritage. As a result, the term is predominantly prevalent in the Upper Midwest, United States––a region with large populations of people with Scandinavian roots––and has been applied to names of places and events, such as:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the so-called Thirty Tyrants enumerated by Trebellius Pollio. His historicity is doubted by some scholars, who consider him an invention of the \"Historia Augusta\".\n\nAccording to the \"Historia Augusta\", in the twelfth year of Gallienus' reign (265), when usurpers were springing up in every quarter of the Roman world, a certain Celsus, who had never risen higher in the service of the state than the rank of a military tribune, living quietly on his lands in Africa, in no way remarkable except as a man of upright life and commanding person, was suddenly proclaimed emperor by Vibius Passienus, proconsul of the province, and Fabius Pomponianus, general of the Libyan frontier. So sudden was the movement, that the appropriate trappings of dignity had not been provided, and the hands of Galliena, a cousin it is said of the lawful monarch, invested the new prince with a robe snatched from the statue of a goddess.\n\nThe downfall of Celsus was not less rapid than his elevation: he was slain on the seventh day, his body was devoured by dogs, and the loyal inhabitants of Sicca testified their devotion to the reigning sovereign by devising an insult to the memory of his rival unheard-of before that time.

His younger brother Malcolm, also prominent in Herefordshire and an MP in several Parliaments, died childless. His sister Joan married Simon Brockbury and their daughter Margaret married William Seymour, having a son Roger (died 1420) who inherited his great-uncle's estates, which implies that Sir Peter died childless and may never have married.\n\nBefore becoming Speaker, Mare worked as a toll collector, was Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1374, and served as a steward to Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March. It may have been his connection with Mortimer which led to his election to Parliament.\n\nPeter de la Mare attended the Good Parliament in 1376 as a knight of the shire for Herefordshire. After being elected as Speaker, he served as a spokesman for the House of Commons in the House of Lords during the indictment of various figures close to King Edward III, including the king's mistress Alice Perrers, who was accused of having gained an undue degree of influence over the king. However, the political influence of the Good Parliament was brief. In November 1376, Peter de la Mare was imprisoned in Nottingham Castle by John of Gaunt. Despite pleas for his release, the Bad Parliament of 1377 refused to pardon him. However, he regained his freedom in June 1377, following the death of Edward III. Following his release, Mare was pardoned and compensated by King Richard II. He was re-elected as Speaker of the Commons in the Parliament of October 1377.\n\nPeter de la Mare served in several more Parliaments during the 1380s. The last recorded mention of him was as a feoffee to Richard Burley in 1387.\n\nMany scholars agree that the parliament of rats and mice in the prologue of \"Piers Plowman\" is a direct reference to the Good Parliament. Peter de la Mare is portrayed as the \"rat of renown\" who proposes belling the cat (who is probably John of Gaunt), thus casting him as a well-intentioned reformer who would not or could not follow through.\n\n"}
{"id": "1939870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939870", "title": "Dale's principle", "text": "Dale's principle\n\nIn neuroscience, Dale's principle (or Dale's law) is a rule attributed to the English neuroscientist Henry Hallett Dale. The principle basically states that a neuron performs the same chemical action at all of its synaptic connections to other cells, regardless of the identity of the target cell. However, there has been disagreement about the precise wording.\n\nBecause of an ambiguity in the original statement, there are actually two versions of the principle, one that has been shown definitively to be false, and another that remains a valuable rule of thumb. The term \"Dale's Principle\" was first used by Sir John Eccles in 1954, in a passage reading, \"In conformity with Dale's principle (1934, 1952) that the same chemical transmitter is released from all the synaptic terminals of a neurone…\" Some modern writers have understood the principle to state that \"neurons release one and only one transmitter at all of their synapses\", which is false. Others, including Eccles himself in later publications, have taken it to mean that \"neurons release the same set of transmitters at all of their synapses\".\n\nDale himself never stated his \"principle\" in an explicit form. The source that Eccles referred to was a lecture published by Dale in 1934, called \"Pharmacology and nerve endings\", describing some of the early research into the physiology of neurotransmission. At that time, only two chemical transmitters were known, acetylcholine and noradrenaline (then thought to be adrenaline). In the peripheral nervous system, cholinergic and adrenergic transmission were known to arise from different groups of nerve fibers. Dale was interested in the possibility that a neuron releasing one of these chemicals in the periphery might also release the same chemical at central synapses. He wrote:\nIt is to be noted, further, that in the cases for which direct evidence is already available, the phenomena of regeneration appear to indicate that the nature of the chemical function, whether cholinergic or adrenergic, is characteristic for each particular neurone, and unchangeable.\nAnd near the end of the paper:\nWhen we are dealing with two different endings of the same sensory neurone, the one peripheral and concerned with vasodilatation and the other at a central synapse, can we suppose that the discovery and identification of a chemical transmitter of axon-reflex vasodilatation would furnish a hint as to the nature of the transmission process at a central synapse? The possibility has at least some value as a stimulus to further experiment.\nWith only two transmitter chemicals known to exist at the time, the possibility of a neuron releasing more than one transmitter at a single synapse did not enter anybody's mind, and so no care was taken to frame hypotheses in a way that took this possibility into account. The resulting ambiguity in the initial statements led to some confusion in the literature about the precise meaning of the principle. Nicoll and Malenka, for example, understood it to state that a neuron always releases one and only one neurotransmitter at all of its synapses. In this form it is certainly false. Many neurons release more than one neurotransmitter, in what is called \"cotransmission\". Although there were earlier hints, the first formal proposal of this discovery did not come until 1976. Most neurons release several different chemical messengers. In modern neuroscience, neurons are often classified by their neurotransmitter and most important cotransmitter, for example striatal GABA neurons utilize either opioid peptides or substance P as the primary cotransmitter.\n\nIn a 1976 publication, however, Eccles interpreted the principle in a subtly different way:\n\n\"I proposed that Dale’s Principle be defined as stating that at all the axonal branches of a neurone, there was liberation of the same transmitter substance or substances.\"\nThe addition of \"or substances\" is critical. With this change, the principle allows for the possibility of neurons releasing more than one transmitter, and only asserts that the same set are released at all synapses. In this form, it continues to be an important rule of thumb, with only a few known exceptions, including David Sulzer and Stephen Rayport's finding that dopamine neurons also release glutamate as a neurotransmitter, but at separate release sites.\n"}

It was released on 16 August 1987 by the Posercorpse record label.\n\nThough influential to black metal, its lyrics and sound were largely influenced by early death metal bands. After vocalist Dead joined the group, the band adopted darker lyrical topics and guitarist Euronymous (Øystein Aarseth) started rejecting most death metal bands as their lyrics turned towards \"social awareness\" and \"normal\" topics instead of death worship; he \"wanted things to be more serious and extreme\". Dead stated that the lyrics \"aren't bad at all, but they are later what would become gore and trendy\".\n\nThe opening track \"Silvester Anfang\" was provided to the band by German electronic composer Conrad Schnitzler, after Euronymous found Schnitzler's home address and sat outside his house until he was eventually invited in. Euronymous then asked Schnitzler to compose an intro for the album; rather than record a new composition Schnitzler gave Euronymous a random piece from his archives, which turned out to be \"Silvester Anfang\".\n\nDrummer Kjetil Manheim later stated that the band's sound was \"something that [the studio technician] did not know how to record (...) so he just set the settings and we recorded\".

It was produced with a conventional undercarriage for carrier use, although this could be exchanged for floats for catapult use aboard capital ships.\n\nThe Flycatcher was designed to meet the requirements of Specification N6/22 for a carrier and floatplane fighter to replace the Gloster Nightjar, powered by either the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar or the Bristol Jupiter radial engines. Both Fairey and Parnall submitted designs to meet this specification, with Fairey producing the Flycatcher, and Parnall the Parnall Plover. The first of three prototype Flycatchers made its maiden flight on 28 November 1922, powered by a Jaguar II engine, although it was later fitted with a Jupiter IV. Small orders were placed for both the Flycatcher (for nine aircraft) and Plover (for ten aircraft) to allow service evaluation. After trials, the Flycatcher was ordered for full production.\n\nThe Flycatcher was a remarkable design for its time, and was one of the earliest aircraft specifically designed for operation from aircraft carriers. Flaps ran the entire trailing edges of both wings. These could be lowered for landing and takeoff, providing the aircraft with the capability of using only of deck space \"to come and go.\"\n\nThe fuselage was made of both wood and metal with fabric covering. A rather cumbersome undercarriage could be changed for twin floats or a wheel/float combination for amphibian use.\n\nHydraulic wheel brakes were added to assist the aircraft to stop in the confined space of an aircraft carrier. Arrestor hooks on the undercarriage spreader bar were a feature of early models, designed to engage the arrestor wires strung out on the carrier deck.\n\nProduction of the Flycatcher began at Fairey's Hayes factory in 1923, entering service with No. 402 Flight Fleet Air Arm. The Flycatcher was flown from all British carriers of its era. Some 192 were produced. A typical deployment was on the aircraft carrier , where 16 Flycatchers served alongside 16 Blackburn Ripons and 16 reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nVery popular with pilots, the Flycatchers were easy to fly and very manoeuvrable. It was in these aircraft that the Fleet Air Arm developed the combat tactics used in the Second World War.\n\nThe Flycatcher saw service with the Home, Mediterranean, East Indies and China fleets.\nDuring its service on the China station, the Flycatcher was active against Chinese pirates in the waters near Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nNo aircraft survives, but the Fleet Air Arm Museum holds a replica Flycatcher that was built in 1977. Registered as G-BEYB, it was flown until 1996, when it was put on static display. It is currently held in the museum's reserve collection, to which the public has only occasional access.\n\n"}

He worked as a film director for more than a decade before his best known film \"La battaglia di Algeri\" (\"The Battle of Algiers\", 1966) was released. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1966.\n\nHis other films include \"Kapò\" (1960), which takes place in a World War II concentration camp, \"Burn!\" (\"Queimada\", 1969), starring Marlon Brando about the machinations of colonial powers in small countries, and \"Ogro\" (1979), which reconstructs the murder of Luis Carrero Blanco by ETA. In 2000, he received the Pietro Bianchi Award at the Venice Film Festival. He was also a screenwriter and composer of film scores, and a close friend of Italian President Giorgio Napolitano.\n\nPontecorvo, born in Pisa, was the son of a wealthy secular Italian Jewish family. His father was a businessman. Gillo's siblings included brothers Bruno Pontecorvo, an internationally acclaimed nuclear physicist and one of the so-called Via Panisperna boys, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950; Guido Pontecorvo, a geneticist; and Polì [Paul] Pontecorvo, an engineer who worked on radar after World War II; and David Maraoni; and sisters Giuliana (m. Talbet); Laura (m. Coppa); and Anna (m. Newton).\n\nGillo Pontecorvo studied chemistry at the University of Pisa, but dropped out after passing just two exams. There he first became aware of opposition political forces, coming into contact for the first time with leftist students and professors. In 1938, faced with growing anti-Semitism, he followed his elder brother Bruno to Paris, where he found work in journalism and as a tennis instructor.\n\nIn Paris Pontecorvo became involved in the film world, and began by making a few short documentaries. He became an assistant to Joris Ivens, a Dutch documentary filmmaker and well-known Marxist, whose films include \"Regen\" and \"The Bridge\". He also assisted Yves Allégret, a French director known for his work in the film noir genre, whose films include \"Une si jolie petite plage\" and \"Les Orgueilleux\". In addition to these influences, Pontecorvo began meeting people who broadened his perspectives, among them artist Pablo Picasso, composer Igor Stravinsky and political thinker Jean-Paul Sartre. During this time Pontecorvo developed his political ideals. He was moved when many of his friends in Paris packed up to go and fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nIn 1941 Pontecorvo joined the Italian Communist Party. He traveled to northern Italy to help organize partisans. Going by the pseudonym \"Barnaba\", he became a leader of the Resistance in Milan from 1943 until 1945. Pontecorvo broke ties with the Communist party in 1956 after the Soviet intervention to suppress the Hungarian Revolution. He did not, however, renounce his dedication to Marxism.\n\nIn a 1983 interview with the UK's \"The Guardian\" newspaper, he said, \"I am not an out-and-out revolutionary. I am merely a man of the Left, like a lot of Italian Jews.\"\n\nAfter World War II and his return to Italy, Pontecorvo decided to leave journalism for filmmaking, a shift that appears to have been developing for some time. The catalyst was his seeing Roberto Rossellini's \"Paisà\" (1946). He bought a 16mm camera and shot several documentaries, mostly self-funded, beginning with \"Missione Timiriazev\" in 1953. He directed \"Giovanna\", which was one episode of \"La rosa dei venti\" (1957), a film made of episodes by several directors.\n\nIn 1957 he directed his first full-length film, \"La grande strada azzurra\" (\"The Wide Blue Road\"), which foreshadowed his mature style of later films. It explores the life of a fisherman and his family on a small island in the Adriatic. Because of the scarcity of fish in nearby waters, the fisherman, Squarciò, has to sail out to the open sea, where he fishes illegally with bombs. The film won a prize at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. Pontecorvo spent months, and sometimes years, researching the material for his films in order to accurately represent the social situations he explored. In the next two years, Pontecorvo directed \"Kapò\" (1960), a drama set in a Nazi death camp. The plot of the film is about an escape attempt from a concentration camp by a young Jewish girl. In 1961 it was the Italian candidate for the United States' Academy Awards, and it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film. In this same year, the film won two awards: the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists awarded Didi Perego a Silver Ribbon for best supporting actress, and the Mar del Plata Film Festival awarded Susan Strasberg for best actress.\n\nPontecorvo is best known for his 1966 masterpiece \"The Battle of Algiers\" (released in Italian as \"La battaglia di Algeri\"). It is widely viewed as one of the finest films of its genre: a neorealistic film. Its portrayal of the Algerian resistance during the Algerian War uses the neorealist style pioneered by fellow Italian film directors de Santis and Rossellini. He used newsreel-style footage and non-professional actors. He focused primarily on the native Algerians, a disenfranchised population who were seldom featured in the general media. Though very much Italian neorealist in style, Pontecorvo co-produced with an Algerian film company. The script was written with intention that actual Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) leaders would act in it. (For example, the character Djafar was played by an FLN leader, Yacef Saadi.) Pontecorvo's theme was clearly anti-imperalist. He later described the film as a \"hymn ... in homage to the people who must struggle for their independence, not only in Algeria, but everywhere in the third world\" and said, \"the birth of a nation happens with pain on both sides, although one side has cause and the other not.\"\n\n\"The Battle of Algiers\" achieved great success and influence. It was widely screened in the United States, where Pontecorvo received a number of awards. He was nominated for two Academy Awards for direction and screenplay (a collaboration). The film has been used as a training video by government strategists for dealing with guerrilla resistance, as well as by revolutionary groups. It has been and remains extremely popular in Algeria, providing a popular memory of the struggle for independence from France.\n\nThe semi-documentary style and use of an almost entirely non-professional cast (only one trained actor appears in the film) was a great influence on a number of future filmmakers and films. Its influence can be seen in the few surviving works of West German filmmaker Teod Richter, made from the late 1960s up to his disappearance, and presumed death, in 1986. In addition, more recent commercial American films, such as the \"Blair Witch Project\", \"Paranormal Activity\" and others draw from these techniques for less lofty purposes.\n\nPontecorvo's next major work, \"Queimada!\" (\"Burn!\", 1969), is also anti-colonial, this time set in the Antilles. This film (starring Marlon Brando) depicts an attempted revolution of the oppressed. Pontecorvo continued his series of highly political films with \"Ogro\" (1979), which addresses the occurrence of Basque terrorism at the end of Francisco Franco's dwindling regime in Spain. He continued making short films into the early 1990s and directed a follow-up documentary to \"The Battle of Algiers\" entitled \"Ritorno ad Algeri\" (\"Return to Algiers\", 1992). In 1992, Pontecorvo replaced Guglielmo Biraghi as the director of the Venice Film Festival and was responsible for the festivals of 1992, 1993 and 1994. In 1991, he was a member of the jury at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nGillo Pontecorvo directed films with an eight or nine years gap in between. In an interview that Pontecorvo gave in 1991, when asked why he had directed so few movies, his response was that he could only make a movie with which he is totally in love. He also stated that he had rejected many other movies. Pontecorvo was a director who only directed movies in which he was going to be able to give it his all.\n\nIn 2006, he died from congestive heart failure in Rome at age 86.\n\n\n\n"}

Established in 2001 and managed jointly by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Canadian Wildlife Service, it is in the heart of a major metropolitan area. Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge is one of over 540 National Wildlife Refuges managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within the Department of the Interior. It occupies 7.88 square miles (20.42 km) of scattered property but has drawn boundaries for further expansion.\n\nThe Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge consists primarily of coastal wetlands, several islands in the Detroit River, and waterfront parks. The Refuge includes islands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along of the Detroit River and Western Lake Erie shoreline. It encompasses Humbug Marsh, a wetland in Gibraltar and Trenton in southeastern Wayne County, which is classified as a wetland of international importance.\n\nMuch of the land surrounding the Detroit River is urbanized and, in some places, heavily industrialized. This has resulted in excessive water pollution from the unregulated dumping of chemicals and industrial waste for many decades. Much of the garbage and sewage from Detroit's rapid industrialization found its way into the river. Much of the Detroit River and its shoreline were heavily polluted and unsafe for recreational use. Large quantities of this pollution collected around the mouth of the Detroit River at Lake Erie. The pollutants were so high after the spring thaw that thousands of migrating birds were killed by oil slicks and contaminated water every year. Oxygen levels in the river were depleted to the point where fish were unable to inhabit its waters. Because much of this pollution drained into and affected Lake Erie, portions of the lake itself were considered \"dead\" and unable to support aquatic life. Swimming in the water or consuming any of its remaining fish were considered health risks.\n\nIn 1961, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was founded by congressional order thanks in part to Michigan politician John Lesinski, Jr., who was Michigan's 16th congressional district representative from 1951–1965. The refuge paved the way for tighter restrictions on industries and allocated much needed government funding to clean up the river. However, there was little support from Detroit businesses toward cleaning up the river, because it would negatively affect Detroit's industrialism and economy. In 1970, the entire fishing industry in the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, and Lake Erie had to be temporarily closed due to toxic levels of mercury found in the water. This caused the fishing industry and all those related to lose substantial amounts of money. This, in turn, spurred a massive conservation effort aimed at cleaning up the Detroit River. For years before, conservation efforts were halted by the enormous multimillion-dollar cost of removing pollutants from the river. In addition to that, industries, which had significant political influence, detested the regulations necessary to lessen the amount of pollutants in the river. The Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was very small though and only occupied the area surrounding Grassy Island, and the refuge's existence could not prevent Grassy Island from becoming highly contaminated from toxic soil dredged from the nearby River Rouge.\n\nIn 2001, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was absorbed into the much larger Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, which was largely advocated by veteran Michigan representative John Dingell. The refuge was officially signed into law as the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge Establishment Act (H.R. 1230) by President George W. Bush on December 21, 2001. The Congressional Budget Office originally estimated that the creation of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge would cost between $13–21 million over the first five years, in which the majority of the money spent would be through land acquisitions.\n\nMillions of dollars so far have been used for land acquisitions and to improve the environment around the river. The recent cleaning up and restoration of the Detroit River is remarkable, although other problems are still at hand. Today, many species of native animals — some endangered species — are returning to the area after being driven out by human development. The Detroit River is home to a growing number of bird species, such as eagles (including reintroduced bald eagles), ospreys, and peregrine falcons. Fish species in abundance in the area include lake whitefish, sturgeon, salmon, perch, and walleye. Numerous mammal species also occupy the coastline throughout the refuge. The area serves as a vital migratory route and resting place for countless species of birds. Over 30 species of waterfowl, 17 species of raptors, 31 species of shorebirds, 160 species of songbirds, and 117 species of fish live along or regularly migrate through the Detroit River.\n\nAt its inception, the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge included only areas that were part of the former Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge. This included only 304 acres (123 ha) surrounding Grassy Island and Mamajuda Island just north of Grosse Ile in the Detroit River. Soon after, Mud Island just north of Grassy Island was donated to the refuge by the National Steel Corporation. The refuge continued to expand through land acquisitions to include Calf Island in 2002. In 2003, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stuck a cooperative agreement with DTE Energy to include portions of their properties into the refuge, including the Lagoona Beach Unit and Brancheau Unit of the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station. This was the refuge's first expansion into Monroe County along the coast of Lake Erie. Other areas in Lake Erie extending as far south as the Michigan–Ohio border were eventually included into the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. Many of these lands were through cooperative management acquisitions, where the property would be included into the refuge but not owned directly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nIn 2004, the refuge grew to include Humbug Marsh, which is in Gibraltar and Trenton and also includes Humbug Island. At the same time, the refuge acquired the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Strong Unit just north of Estral Beach. In 2005, the refuge acquired joint management over the 243-acre (98 ha) Eagle Island Marsh in Monroe, Michigan. This land is at the mouth of the River Raisin in between the Monroe Power Plant and Sterling State Park. This section, which was once very polluted, is owned by Automotive Components Holdings and is the location of a large Ford factory. In 2006, the refuge grew to include the 780-acre (315 ha) Lake Erie Metropark in Brownstown Charter Township. With the acquisition of the Erie Marsh in 2006, the refuge doubled its size to include the southern wetlands of Erie Township near the Ohio border, including Gard Island in the North Maumee Bay Archeological District. This was a major milestone for the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. The refuge grew from its original 304 acres (123 ha) in 2001 to 5,047 acres (2,042 ha) by 2007. The last of these acquisitions was an area referred to as Howard Fix at 65 acres (26 ha). It is near the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, but little has been published about this property.\n\nThe Refuge also owns the shoals around these islands and has entered into cooperative agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Detroit Edison, a local electricity company, to manage hundreds of acres of habitat on Lake Erie. Within the authorized boundaries of the Refuge are several existing parks including Elizabeth Park, Sterling State Park, Lake Erie Metropark, as well as Pointe Mouillee State Game Area and Erie State Game Area.\n\nThe headquarters of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge are in Grosse Ile Township, which is not officially listed as part of the refuge. In Canada, the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge does not have any formal boundaries, and no Canadian portions of the Detroit River or Lake Erie are officially included into the refuge. All properties and potential future land acquisition sites are within the United States and governed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nWhile the boundaries of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge encompass only 7.88 square miles (20.42 km) of property scattered along the west coast of the Detroit River and Lake Erie, the Department of the Interior has approved of future land acquisitions by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service totaling 18.75 square miles (48.56 km) of land and water. Expanding the territory through land acquisitions is a top priority for the refuge. The expansion of the refuge is limited due to finances and the fact that most areas within the proposed range are privately owned. Most of the land within the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge is jointly operated by individual landowners and the federal government. The expansion could also include areas of significant permanent populations, such as the islands of Grosse Ile Township, the riverfronts of several Downriver communities, Berlin and Frenchtown charter townships, and Monroe.\n\nThe proposed range stretches for 48 miles from the southern border of Detroit at Zug Island in the city of River Rouge south all the way to the Michigan–Ohio border. The expansion would not include any areas within the city limits of Detroit. Potential areas within this realm include Zug Island, Grosse Ile, Elizabeth Park, Pointe Mouillee State Game Area, Sterling State Park, and Turtle Island. Potential Canadian additions to the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge include the large Fighting Island, which has already undergone major recovery after serving as an industrial dumping ground for decades, Grass Island, Turkey Island, Crystal Island, and Bois Blanc Island.\n\n"}

Instrumentation is sometimes used as a synonym for orchestration. This juxtaposition of the two terms was first made in 1843 by Hector Berlioz in his \"Grand traité d'instrumentation et d'orchestration modernes\", and various attempts have since been made to differentiate them. Instrumentation is a more general term referring to an orchestrator's, composer's or arranger's selection of instruments in varying combinations, or even a choice made by the performers for a particular performance, as opposed to the narrower sense of orchestration, which is the act of scoring for orchestra a work originally written for a solo instrument or smaller group of instruments .\n\nWriting for any instrument requires a composer or arranger to know the instrument's properties, such as:\n\nWhereas \"orchestration\" refers to the deployment and combination of instruments in large ensembles, \"instrumentation\" is a wider term that also embraces the ingenuity of composers and arrangers in the handling of small ensembles. J. S. Bach experimented with a variety of instrumental groups throughout his composing life. A striking example is the band that he selected to accompany the solo bass singer in the \"Quoniam\" movement from his Mass in B minor.\nAccording to George Stauffer, \"The 'Quoniam' is one of Bach's most extraordinary arias. The setting—bass voice, horn, two bassoons and continuo—is unique in his oeuvre. Indeed, one is hard pressed to ﬁnd the combination elsewhere in the Baroque repertory.\" \n\nThe haunting second movement of Schubert's Trio in E-flat major exemplifies the variety and interest that is possible with just three instruments. Writing of this movement Charles speaks of how Schubert \"often concentrated, not on the motif, but on the space outlined by the motif, rearranging the elements within that space in different permutations.\" The movement opens with the main theme played on the cello with the piano providing a trudging accompaniment consisting of repeated chords:\nWhen the theme repeats a few bars later, these roles are exchanged. The piano plays the melody in octaves, while the violin and cello play the accompaniment:\nLater in the movement, the piano plays both the theme in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left, leaving the violin and cello free to provide decorative countermelodies:\nThe concluding bars of the movement ring the changes in instrumentation yet again, adding further ideas, such as the falling octave figure in the first and final bars, while varying and enriching the harmony and instrumental color. The strings here accompany the piano playing pizzicato, before returning to their bows for the deeply expressive final bars:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1939939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939939", "title": "Tony Jannus", "text": "Tony Jannus\n\nAntony Habersack Jannus, more familiarly known as Tony Jannus (July 22, 1889 – October 12, 1916), was an early American pilot whose aerial exploits were widely publicized in aviation's pre-World War I period. He flew the first airplane from which a parachute jump was made, in 1912. Jannus was also the first airline pilot, having pioneered the inaugural flight of the St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line on January 1, 1914, the first scheduled commercial airline flight in the world using heavier-than-air aircraft. The \"Tony Jannus Award\", created to perpetuate his legacy, recognizes outstanding individual achievement in the scheduled commercial aviation industry and is conferred annually by the Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society founded in Tampa, Florida, in 1963.\n\nJannus was born in Washington, D.C., where his father Frankland Jannus was a patent \nattorney and his great-grandfather, Roger C. Weightman, had previously been mayor (1824–1827). By 1910, the 21-year-old young man was employed as a boat engine mechanic. He became interested in flying when he saw an airshow in Baltimore, Maryland, in November, 1910, and began flight training that year at College Park Airport in Maryland. In 1911, Jannus was the first pilot to fly the \"Lord Baltimore II\", an amphibious airplane built in Baltimore, from the city's Curtis Bay. His older brother, Roger Weightman Jannus (1886-1918), also learned to fly and both brothers became test pilots for airplane builder Thomas W. Benoist in St. Louis, Missouri, in late 1911.\n\nOn March 1, 1912, Tony Jannus piloted a Benoist biplane when Albert Berry made the first parachute jump from a moving airplane near St. Louis. Later that year, Jannus set a overwater flight record following the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers from Omaha, Nebraska, to New Orleans in a Benoist Land Tractor Type XII mounted with floats.\n\nDuring the Great Lakes Reliability Cruise in 1913, Thomas W. Benoist entered three aircraft, flown by Antony Jannus, Hugh Robinson, and Benoist himself.\n\nAlso in 1913, Jannus participated in a \"New York Times\"-sponsored air exhibition. He flew actress Julia Bruns in a Baldwin Red Devil 4,000 ft above Staten Island for twenty minutes on October 12, 1913. The next day, he flew in an air race over Manhattan, the \"Times\" reporting that \"The graceful Benoist biplane sailed along on an even keel...driven by the famous Tony Jannus\". Jannus described flying as, \"...poetry of mechanical motion, a fascinating sensation of speed, an abstraction from things material into an infinite space.\" On 15 October, Jannus crashed on take off while setting off to search for Albert Jewell, an aviator who had disappeared over off southern Long Island while flying to join the race on 13 October; Jannus was unhurt in the crash, though the airplane was written off.\n\nThe following month, Jannus moved to St. Petersburg, Florida\n\nPrior to 1914, travel from Tampa, Florida, to St. Petersburg, located on a then-isolated peninsula, required a slow steamboat trip across Tampa Bay or a circuitous, five-hour journey by railroad. A bumpy automobile or horse and buggy ride took many hours over primitive, unpaved roads. The airplane at the time was a rare novelty, lacking any practical application. Impressed by the record-setting overwater flight made by Jannus in 1912, Florida businessman Percival Fansler approached some St. Petersburg businessmen the next year with a proposal to use Benoist flying boats for \"a real commercial line\" over open water between the two cities. Convinced by Fansler's plan, several St. Petersburg community leaders, led by L. A. Whitney of the local chamber of commerce and Noel Mitchell, agreed to provide financial support for the creation of an airline service to connect the two cities. A 90-day contract with Benoist was signed on December 17, 1913 (the 10th anniversary of Wilbur and Orville Wright's historic first airplane flight), to provide airplanes and crew for two daily round trips across Tampa Bay, dubbed the \"St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line\" — the world's first scheduled airline. Fansler told the \"St. Petersburg Times\": \"The St. Petersburg waterfront is an ideal place for starting and landing as the trip to and from Tampa will be one of the most beautiful in the country. Skimming a few feet above the surface of the water... with the purr of a 75 h.p. engine and the whirring of a propeller turning several hundred times a minute, the rush of the cool salt air and the shimmering sunlight on Tampa Bay — no trip could be more enjoyable.\".\nDeparting from a location on January 1, 1914, near the downtown St. Petersburg Municipal Pier on Second Avenue North, Jannus piloted the twenty-three-minute inaugural flight of the pioneer airline's Benoist XIV flying boat biplane. A crowd of 3,000 gathered at the pier to watch the history-making takeoff at 10 a.m. and were told by Fansler that \"What was impossible yesterday is an accomplishment today, while tomorrow heralds the unbelieveable\" . Abram C. Pheil, former mayor of St. Petersburg, won an auction for the first ticket with a winning bid of $400 and was a passenger on the inaugural flight . It was the first time a ticket was sold to the general public for point-to-point scheduled air travel. The Benoist reportedly reached a maximum speed of during the flight, according to a United Press account. Other reports indicate that Jannus flew over the Bay at an altitude of less than . Upon the airboat's arrival in Tampa, the \"Tampa Tribune\" reported, \"a crowd of two thousand was waiting...Messrs. Jannus and Pheil bowed and smiled\". Thereafter, flights departed St. Petersburg daily except Sundays at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.. Return flights left Tampa at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.\n\nFollowing the end of the St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line's scheduled service between the two Florida cities on March 31, 1914, Jannus left St. Petersburg and quit flying for Benoist, becoming a test pilot for Curtiss Aeroplane Company. In July, 1915, Jannus successfully flew the prototype Curtiss JN-3, forerunner of the JN-4 \"Jenny\" of World War I fame. On October 1, 1915, he was sent by Glenn Curtiss to Russia as the company's test pilot and trainer of Russian pilots flying Curtiss airplanes in combat during World War I.\n\nJannus died on October 12, 1916, near Sevastopol (then part of Czarist Russia) when his plane, a Curtiss H-7 he was using to train Russian pilots, had engine problems and crashed into the Black Sea, killing Jannus and his two-man Russian crew. His body was never recovered.\n\nThe \"Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society\" founded in 1963, perpetuates the memory of Jannus as the first commercial airline pilot, by annually conferring the \"Tony Jannus Award\" for outstanding achievement in scheduled air transportation. Past recipients of the award include such luminaries as Eddie Rickenbacker, Donald Douglas, Jimmy Doolittle, C. R. Smith (the founder of American Airlines), William A. Patterson (president of United Airlines 1934–1966), and Chuck Yeager. Those so honored are enshrined at the St. Petersburg Museum of History's Tony Jannus exhibit.\n\nAn operational replica of the Benoist Model XIV airplane flew across Tampa Bay in a 75th anniversary re-enactment of Jannus' flight, on January 1, 1989. It is now exhibited at the St. Petersburg Museum of History at the St. Petersburg Pier, approximately from the site of the inaugural flight. On January 29, 2011, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics dedicated an historic site plaque on the museum's grounds, commemorating the site of the world’s first regularly scheduled airline. The birth of the commercial air transportation industry is also commemorated by another replica of the Benoist airplane at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport's baggage claim area in the terminal and a Tony Jannus Award exhibit at Tampa International Airport.\n\nOn December 17, 2006, Jannus was posthumously inducted into the \"Paul E. Garber First Flight Shrine\" at the Wright Brothers National Memorial at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, joining other honorees such as Wilbur and Orville Wright, Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, and Chuck Yeager, who have shaped the aviation industry. Jannus was designated a \"Great Floridian\" by the State of Florida in 2010. The St. Petersburg concert venue Jannus Landing is named for him.\n\n\n"}

In 1951, Modin arranged the defections of Maclean and Guy Burgess. Modin's predecessors in control of the damaging Cambridge spy ring were executed during Stalin's Great Purge.\n\nModin said of Kim Philby in February 1994:\n\nHe never revealed his true self. Neither the British, nor the women he lived with, nor ourselves [the KGB] ever managed to pierce the armour of mystery that clad him. His great achievement in espionage was his life's work, and it fully occupied him until the day he died. But in the end I suspect that Philby made a mockery of everyone, particularly ourselves.\n\nModin published a book, \"Mes Camarades de Cambridge\", in France in 1994. The book identified Baron Rothschild as an important member of the Cambridge Spy Ring. For the British translation, the British publisher Headline Book Publishing, made some changes, first to the title, making it \"My Five Cambridge Friends\" with the sub-heading: \"For the first time, their KGB controller reveals the secrets of the world's most famous spy ring—Burgess, Maclean, Philby, Blunt and Cairncross.\" Second, Headline changed lines on page 104, now saying that John Cairncross was the Fifth Man: 'At the close of 1944, the name of John Cairncross, code-named the Carelian, was added to the four agents to whose cases I had been assigned. He was the \"Fifth Man\". Cairncross had at one time or another been in contact with the others, but he was hardly a member of the group.'\n\nThe words changed and inserted by Headline were a fabrication, according to Modin, who pointed out that Cairncross, to his knowledge, had never been in contact with any member of the group. \"The Guardian\" journalist Richard Norton-Taylor rang Modin to check on this and found him angry that the false claims, changes and fraud on the British (and later US) public, had been made without his being consulted. Alan Rusbridger, who agreed with Perry's assessment that Rothschild was the fifth man, also wrote in \"The Guardian\": \"Yuri Modin ... says in the English edition of his recent book that Cairncross was \"the fifth man.\" Modin says he never used the term, which is not contained in the French edition of his book.' \n\nYuri Modin died in 2007 in Moscow.\n\n"}
