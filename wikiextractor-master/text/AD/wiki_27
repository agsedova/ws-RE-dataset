Commonly distributed in the Palearctic region, the marsh fritillary's common name derives from one of its several habitats, marshland. The prolonged larval stage lasts for approximately seven to eight months and includes a period of hibernation over the winter. The larvae are dependent on the host food plant \"Succisa pratensis\" not only for feeding but also for hibernation, because silken webs are formed on the host plant as the gregarious larvae enter hibernation. Females lay eggs in batches on the host plant and are, like other batch-layers, selective about the location of oviposition because offspring survivorship levels for batch-layers are more tied to location selection than they are for single-egg layers.\n\nAs of 2019 the butterfly's global conservation status is considered of least concern, but it has faced rapid decline and is considered regionally vulnerable or endangered over much of its range.\n\n\"E. aurinia\" is represented by many subspecies. The most widely accepted are:\nbut the total number of described subspecies is much higher, especially in the eastern Palaearctic. The insect may be best considered a superspecies.\n\n\"Euphydryas aurinia\" has a wingspan of in males. The females are usually larger than the males, with a wingspan of . These small butterflies are variable in markings and colouration, with many forms and subspecies. The adult butterflies usually show a chequered pattern of brown, orange, and yellow markings. Silver markings are present on the hindwing edge. The underside of the wings is patterned with yellow, orange, and brown without any silver colouration at all. The eggs are yellow, and easily identified because of the large batch size. The larvae are black.\n\nThis species is widespread in the east Palaearctic ecozone from Ireland in the west to Yakutia in the east, and to north-west China and Mongolia in the south. The marsh fritillary is in decline in Europe and it is one of eleven butterflies covered by the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan. Within the British Isles, it is more frequent in the south and west, but especially in Wales where there is a stronghold \nThis species lives in calcareous grassland, in woodland clearings, in damp marshy areas (hence the common name), and in heathy grassland, dominated by tussock forming grasses, including purple moor and rush pastures. In Finland, \"E. aurinia\" has been shown to favor semi-permanent grasslands and impermanent clearcuts in the forest. Young clearcuts were preferred over old clearcuts due to the dense growth of vegetation in old clearcut forests. In the United Kingdom, two types of grasslands can be inhabited by \"E. aurinia\": damp grasslands that are either neutral or acidophilus and dry grasslands that have an abundance of plants growing in lime-rich soil (calcicolous grasslands). These butterflies can reach an elevation of above sea level.\n\nIn the British Isles, the marsh fritillary is usually found in damp, heathy grasslands that are called \"rhos pastures,\" from the Welsh word \"\" meaning heath. Small populations can be an important element of the ecology because they produce many mobile individuals which can then found other populations. The marsh fritillary is protected under UK law, listed under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, and the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex II). The Devon Wildlife Trust owns a number of sites at which it monitors this species. Examples include Stowford Moor (near Holsworthy, Devon), Dunsdon nature reserve (near Bude), Mambury Moor (near Great Torrington), Vealand Farm nature reserve (near Holsworthy), and Volehouse Nature Reserve (near Holsworthy). In 2009, population counts had significantly increased from years 2007 and 2008. In 2018, a breeding population was found in Carmarthenshire, Wales, after an absence of 50 years.\n\nIn Lithuania (included into the Lithuanian Red Data Book since 2000, red list category-3 (R))(Rašomavičius, 2007) is protected insect species. Euphydryas aurinia usually is found in natural and seminatural moist or wet oligotrophic grasslands (purple moorgrass and heath rush meadows), base rich fens, mostly in Eastern, North-Western and Central Lithuania, where its main foodplant Succisa pratensis (Dipsacaceae) is abundant. Inhabited patches frequently are situated along woodland edges or surrounded by bushes. Species is not found in Southern Lithuania where sandy soils predominate and in South-Western Lithuania where agriculture is very intensive. \n\nThe availability of larval food plant \"S. pratensis\" and grass height are the most important factors in providing an optimal habitat for \"E. aurinia\".\n\nBecause caterpillars live in communal webs formed around their host plant and hibernate through the winter inside the web, the density of host plant is a crucial factor in forming the habitat of \"E. aurinia\". Studies have shown that the density of host plant is directly correlated to the number of larval webs found, which in turn is directly related to the number of adult butterflies. Therefore, a habitat suitable for the larvae can indirectly influence the proliferation of adult butterflies.\n\nNot only is the density of host plant crucial for a favorable habitat, but also the height of the sward, the expanse of grass covering the area where \"E. aurinia\" lives. Sward height that is too short can lead to increased exposure of the larvae to predators and can cause limited food availability, leading to starvation. However, if the sward height is too tall and densely packed, then it becomes difficult for adult butterflies to locate the host plant to oviposit on. Thus, the level of sward height is most optimal when it is medium height.\n\nThe caterpillars are known to feed primarily on \"Succisa pratensis\" and species of \"Digitalis\", \"Plantago lanceolata\", \"Knautia arvensis\", \"Scabiosa succisa\", \"Scabiosa columbaria,\" \"Veronica\" (\"Veronica dubravnaya\", etc.), \"Geranium\", \"Sambucus\", \"Gentiana\", \"Valeriana\", \"Lonicera implexa\", \"Filipendula\", \"Spiraea\" and \"Viburnum\".\n\nOne study measuring the level of volatiles released by plants that are consumed by herbivores has shown that huge amounts of methanol and other volatile substances (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and lipoxygenase-derived volatile compounds) are emitted by \"E. aurinia\" caterpillars feeding on the host plant \"S. pratensis\". Methanol is a biochemically active compound that is commonly released by metabolic activities of anaerobic bacteria.\n\nAdult butterflies feed on nectar opportunistically, so the density of host plant \"S. pratensis\" does not affect adult butterfly feeding. In fact, by the time adult butterflies emerge, \"S. pratensis\" does not even flower. Adults are polyphagous and generally feed on \"Ranunculus\" ssp., \"Cirsium\" ssp., \"Leucantherum vulgare\", \"Myosotis\" ssp., \"Rubus\" ssp most often. They have also been observed feeding on \"Caltha palustris\", also known as kingcup or marsh-marigold, and \"Ajuga reptans\", also known as bugle or bugleweed.\n\n\"E. aurinia\" females are batch-layers, meaning they lay a large number of eggs at one site. Because 200-300 eggs are at stake every time an egg-laying site is chosen, batch-laying females tend to undergo a discrimination phase in searching for a location to lay eggs on. Each plant can serve as an egg-laying site for four to five clusters of eggs, meaning that more than a thousand larvae may hatch on a single plant. If so, the newly-hatched larvae will face serious food shortage and fierce competition for food, which has huge repercussions for offspring survivorship. Therefore, \"Euphydryas\" and other batch-laying females, such as \"Melitaeini\" females, spend more time choosing a place to lay eggs and are more selective when looking for a host plant.\n\nFemale oviposition depends largely on the size of host plant as well as density of vegetation cover. Studies have shown that females prefer to lay eggs on large host plants as opposed to smaller plants. This is to prevent food shortage and starvation of the larvae. Also, sparse, open vegetation structure is favored over dense, thick grasslands when the host plant \"S. pratensis\" is used for oviposition. The presence of a tall non-host plant (e.g. \"Deschampsia caespitosa\") is negatively correlated with egg nests. Therefore, abandoned meadows with lime-rich soil have been identified as oviposition sites. Often, \"E. aurinia\" will lay eggs at edges of such meadows because the vegetation structure and plant height fit the female butterfly preference for oviposition. For such reasons, croplands are generally favored over meadows for oviposition because croplands tend to have concentrated numbers of large-sized host plants.\n\nFemales prefer to lay eggs on leaves with the highest chlorophyll contents. Therefore, the reflectance and chlorophyll concentration of leaves also affects the choice of oviposition site for \"E. aurinia\". Chlorophyll content (the \"greenness\" of plants) can be an indicator for increased fitness of the host plant, which in turn will provide optimal growth opportunities for the newly hatched larvae. Females therefore use visual cues to seek out the greenest leaves to lay their eggs on. However, there are also indications that it is not high chlorophyll concentration but the presence of conspecific egg clusters which attracts females to oviposit on a certain leaf.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the presence of short grasses that can serve a cushion-like function (especially \"Nardus stricta)\" in the vicinity of the host plant was positively correlated with nest numbers. In general, conditions that promote host plant growth and proliferation are also favorable for nests. Dry, acidic conditions with limited nitrogen resources are preferred for nests because these conditions lead to short swards. Short swards facilitate larval basking, and thus is a factor considered by females during oviposition.\n\n\"Euphydryas aurinia\" is a univoltine species.\n\nThe eggs are laid in groups on the underside of leaves in May and June. Up to 350 are laid in a single batch. They turn from pale yellow when first laid, to bright yellow, then crimson, and finally to dark grey just prior to hatching.\n\nThe caterpillars hatch in about three weeks from the end of June onwards. There are six instars for \"E. aurinia\" larvae. The first four are gregarious, the first three being prehibernation instars and the fourth being post-hibernation. The first three instars form a communal web around the food plant \"S. pratensis\" and feed on the host plant for about three weeks. The young caterpillars become conspicuous by the end of August. In the autumn, they make stronger webs closer to the ground, usually within a dense grass tussock, where they will start to hibernate.\n\nIn the spring, the fourth instar emerges from hibernation. All three of the post-hibernation instars bask in the sun. Basking is a behavior in which the instar increases its body temperature using heat from solar radiation. This allows them to be relatively independent of ambient temperature, which promotes faster development. During this time, they change color from brown to black.\n\nAt the end of the sixth instar, pupae start forming. This occurs in the spring, around the end of March or beginning of April. Pupation occurs low down deep within grass tussocks or dead leaves.\n\nAdults emerge and undergo the flight period between May and June. However, in southern regions, they can be on wing starting from late May. Adults have short life spans, usually lasting about two weeks.\n\nResearch on the population dynamics of the marsh fritillary has shown that they live in metapopulations. A metapopulation is defined as a collection of local populations that are connected together as a result of occasional dispersal. Amongst these some will disappear and others will be founded. An important feature of metapopulations is that there will always be empty habitat within the system. It is possible for the majority of the habitat patches to be empty. The security of suitable places where the butterfly does not presently inhabit is essential to its survival in the long term.\n\n\"E. aurinia\" butterflies tend to exhibit sedentary behavior, which leads to an increase in local dispersal rather than regional or long-distance dispersal. Males are more likely to emigrate than females, and even so, \"E. aurinia\" rarely move to neighboring patches. The average local population size increases as a result of the limited mobility of adult butterflies. Thus, the fluctuation of one habitat patch population size is unlikely to affect the population size of another habitat patch. The relative turnover rate of extinction and recolonization of previously empty habitat patches is high for \"E. aurinia\", which indicates that extinction of one local population can be balanced by re-colonization of another. Such classic metapopulation characteristics explain why there is greater within-population genetic structuring in \"E. aurinia\".\n\nMating is believed to occur randomly, as shown by the fact that there is no significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in \"E. aurinia\" populations. Adult males display sedentary behavior, perching on bushes or grass. They observe and seek out females. Females mate once in their short lifetime and lay multiple batches of eggs. Due to their short lifetime, females mate soon after they emerge from chrysalis. They bear so many eggs that they are unable to fly far distances until they lay the eggs and only crawl to nearby vegetation. Females are larger and less vibrant in color than males.\nKnown predators of \"E. aurinia\" are cuckoos, frogs, and toads, and the ground beetle \"Pterostichus versicolor\". All of these predators prey on the larvae. The caterpillars are liable to be attacked by the parasitoid wasp \"Apanteles bignellii\", especially in warm spring weather. The parasitoid displays gregarious parasitoid larval behavior, meaning more than one parasitoid progeny can develop fully in or on the host. In fact, three regular generations of \"A. bignelli\" occur in one generation of \"E. aurinia,\" usually between the pupae, adult, and egg stages of the host. Also, parasitoid oviposition behavior is selective, meaning that \"A. bignelli\" is a specialist parasitoid. The percent of host population parasitized varies greatly, ranging from 0-80%.\n\nEndosymbiotic bacteria \"Wolbachia\" have been detected in 19 United Kingdom populations at 100% prevalence. When tested for phenotypes such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, sex ratio distortion, mutualistic or neutral relationship, there seemed to be no conclusive phenotype of the endosymbiotic bacteria. Although strains closely matched to the identified \"Wolbachia\" bacteria strain were shown to be sex ratio distorters, no sex ratio distortion was observed in the \"E. aurinia\" populations. Therefore, further research needs to be done to conclude what the phenotype of this symbiotic bacteria is. Possible explanation for the stable sex ratio in \"E. aurinia\" despite the presence of \"Wolbachia\" may be the evolution of traits in the host that suppress the \"Wolbachia\" phenotype from being expressed. If this is the case, then the apparent lack of phenotype of the \"Wolbachia\" bacteria can be explained as phenotype suppression.\n\nAs of 2019 the butterfly's conservation status is globally considered of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. However, several areas report regional decreases in population.\n\nMajor fluctuations of local patch populations of \"E. aurinia\" have been reported in western England, with the population number reaching peaks in the 1890s and mid 1920s at population sizes around 40,000 and 1,000 respectively. Despite the massive number of larvae and pupae observed during these two periods of maximal population growth, the population frequency of \"E. aurinia\" fluctuated drastically as the number of caterpillars observed dropped as low as 16 caterpillars in 1920 after a \"diligent search\". Thus, \"E. aurinia\" serves as a good indicator of environmental changes due to its vulnerability to habitat changes.\n\nAs of 2017, rapid decline of the population had been observed in Denmark due to loss of habitat and host plants.\n\nBecause the larval stage is highly dependent on the host food plant \"S. pratensis\", decline in the availability of the host plant leads to negative effects on the \"E. aurinia\" population. Decline of natural habitats for \"S. pratensis\" is correlated with decline in the host plant population. Due to cultivation and shift of land use from traditional farming to grazing, the frequency of \"S. pratensis\" populations has declined over the past few years. Damp, basic soil is suitable for high \"S. pratensis\" frequency. Environmental changes such as acidification and eutrophication have led to a decline in available optimal habitat for \"S. pratensis\", and consequently for \"E. aurinia\".\n\nAs of 2019 the butterfly had become regionally extinct over much of its former range in the UK. The population size in the UK had decreased by 60% over the period during which records have been kept. Human activities such as modern farming altered their main habitat – England's damp meadows – and have changed the climate as well. This loss of major habitats has led to fragmentation and isolation of \"E. aurinia\" populations, thus leading to metapopulation formation. \"E. aurinia\" is more vulnerable to extinction in the small subpopulations that comprise the metapopulation.\n\nAccording to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee in 2019, the population has \"declined dramatically in Europe and is regarded as endangered or vulnerable in most of its European range,\" and the remaining populations in the UK and Spain are considered the \"European strongholds\" for the species.\n\nModerate farming activity can be beneficial to the \"E. aurinia\" population because it can lead to sparsely-vegetated, open landscape which is suitable for \"E. aurinia\" larvae. Research has shown that the female butterflies prefer to lay their eggs in cropland over meadows. This can be explained by the fact that vegetation is less dense and the host plants tend to be larger in size on cropland. However, excessive landscape changes that come with modern farming techniques can lead to drastic changes in the \"E. aurinia\" population. There have been efforts made to re-introduce butterflies into empty patches of habitat to increase re-colonization, and techniques such as controlled burns and cattle grazing have also been utilized to promote \"E. aurinia\" population growth. These areas are monitored for indicators of success such as the frequency of larval webs and the frequency of flowers and larval food plant.\n\nCattle grazing is a common method which has been adopted in response to the declining \"E. aurinia\" population. An intermediate level of grazing can help maintain moist grasslands, which are optimal for \"S. pratensis\" and \"E. aurinia.\" However, overgrazing can lead to short host plants, which can lead to shortage of food for the newly hatched larvae. Under-grazing can lead to growth of dense, scrubby plants, which is also unsuitable and unfavored by the female butterflies. The aim is to produce an uneven patchwork of short and long vegetation by the end of the grazing period, between 8 and 25 cm.\n\nAnother common method for conservation efforts is swaling, which is a form of land management where controlled burning is used to prevent overgrowth of vegetation and promote wildlife biodiversity. Though it is a temporary solution, swaling can provide suitable habitat conditions for \"E. aurinia\". Criticism against swaling include the fact that it is only a temporary solution, and the possibility that swaling can kill masses of \"E. aurinia\" larvae if done at the wrong time of the year.\n\nLastly, in extreme cases, efforts to re-introduce \"E. aurinia\" butterflies into empty patches of habitat have been attempted in order to increase the colonization rate. Because this method involves extreme human intervention to promote patch population formation, this method is also a temporary fix and used only in rare, extreme cases of local extinction.\n\n\n"}

This new institution was given the name of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, to whom Claparède attributed the \"Copernican reversal\" of putting the child, rather than the teacher, at the centre of the educational process (cf.

According to Piaget, he came to organize his research once he arrived at the Institute in such a way that he \"gain objectively and inductively knowledge about the elementary structures of intelligence\" and use it develop a psychological and biological epistemology.

Born in England, to a British Army father, Mellows grew up in Ashton-under-Lyne, Dublin, Cork and Wexford (where his mother was born). He was active with the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Irish Volunteers, and participated in the Easter Rising in County Galway, and the War of Independence. Elected as a TD to the First Dáil, he rejected the Anglo-Irish Treaty and was captured by pro-Treaty forces during the Irish Civil War. Mellows was executed by Free State forces in 1922.\n\nMellows was born at Hartshead Military Barracks, Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, England, to William Joseph Mellows, a British Army non-commissioned officer, and Sarah Jordan, of Inch, County Wexford. His family moved to 10 Annadale Avenue, Fairview, Dublin, in February 1895 when Sergeant Mellows was transferred there; however, Liam remained in Wexford with his grandfather Patrick Jordan due to ill health. He attended the military school in Wellington Barracks in Cork and the Portobello garrison school in Dublin, but ultimately refused a military career much to his father's disappointment, instead working as a clerk in several Dublin firms, including the Junior Army & Navy Stores on D'Olier Street.\n\nA nationalist from an early age. He purchased a bicycle when resident at 21 Mont Shannon Road, Dublin. Then in 1911 he purchased a copy of \"Irish Freedom\", which began \"We stand for Ireland...\" Mellows approached Thomas Clarke in his shop, who recruited him into Fianna Éireann, an organisation of young republicans. He also met Secretary Patrick O'Ryan, Con Colbert, Eamon Martin, who would be a lifetime friend. At the next meeting, Mellows' brothers all signed up. On 7 April 1911 he was sworn to secrecy by the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Mellows was proposed for the post of Organiser and travelling instructor. He founded the \"Sluagh\" at Dolphins Barn, Co Wexford, which was a success. He established more \"Sluagdste\" at Ferns and Enniscorthy in Easter 1912. Mellows cycled everywhere, which was cheap and convenient; he was promoted Captain by \"Ard Choisde\". In June 1913, Mellows stayed at Waterford IRB Centre with Liam Walsh in the Gaelic League Room, Williams street.\nMellows was organising sports in Tuam, September 1913, when he was introduced to socialist James Connolly at Countess Markievicz's residence, where Connolly was recuperating after his hunger strike. Connolly was deeply impressed and told his daughter Nora 'I have found a real man'. Mellows was called back to Dublin on 25 November 1913. He was active in the IRB and was a founder member of the Irish Volunteers, being brought onto its Organising Committee to strengthen the Fianna representation. He was given a full-time job on 30 s. p/wk. He joined forces with Eamon Ceannt and Sir Horace Plunkett at the Provisional Committee choosing to support the parliamentary route taken by Roger Casement. But as an employee he was compelled to agree with Redmondite candidates; although he had voted against the Nationalists pro-British policy.\n\nHe was arrested and jailed on several occasions under the Defence of the Realm Act. On 1 August his company were taking an arms shipment from Howth to Dublin, when they fired on RIC at Clontarf. That evening De Valera took him by car to Kilcoole. Guns were loaded on a charabanc in Bray at night and then distributed in Dublin from a fleet of taxis. He was sent to Galway, and made his base at Athenry. There he met Sean MacDiarmada and was appointed as election scrutineer at Tuam. On Sunday 18 May 1915, they were at an anti-enlistment rally, when arrested by Inspector Comerford with a gun in his back. MacDiarmada was searched: they found a note book of IRB lists on his person. He was sentenced to 6 months. Mellows got away. He started a training group at Kynoch's Fort, south Galway recruiting men from miles around. On 1 July he was arrested at Courttown Harbour. He was sentenced to 3 months. Both men were sent to Mountjoy Prison. Months later he was with volunteers at Tullamore, when they were attacked by machine-guns, and fleeing the Hall over rooftops, made off by motor-bike; Mellows returned to post a letter to protect comrades. A week later he was arrested at Julia Morrissey's house. The British took him by train to Arbour Hill Prison, before he was shipped to England, and Leek.\n\nEventually escaping from Reading Jail he returned to Ireland to command the \"Western Division\" (forces operating in the West of Ireland) of the IRA during the Easter Rising of 1916. He led roughly 700 Volunteers in abortive attacks on Royal Irish Constabulary stations at Oranmore, and Clarinbridge in county Galway taking over the town of Athenry. However, his men were very badly armed and supplied and they dispersed after a week, when British troops and the cruiser were sent west to attack them. In the aftermath of the Uprising over three hundred Galway Volunteers were deported to jails across England and Scotland.\n\nAfter this insurrection failed, Mellows escaped to the United States, where he was arrested and detained without trial in the \"Tombs\" prison, New York, on a charge of attempting to aid the German side in the First World War. This was in the context of incidents like the Black Tom and Kingsland explosions, where German agents had bombed neutral American ports and industrial facilities.\n\nAfter his release in 1918, he worked with John Devoy and helped to organise Éamon de Valera's fund raising visit to America in 1919–1920. He returned to Ireland to become Irish Republican Army \"Director of Supplies\" during the Irish War of Independence, responsible for buying arms. At the 1918 general election, he was elected to the First Dáil as a Sinn Féin candidate for both Galway East and for North Meath. (According to United Kingdom law, these were Westminster constituencies but Sinn Féin did not recognise them as such, but rather took them as de facto Dáil constituencies).\n\nMellows considered the Anglo-Irish Treaty as signed to be a betrayal of the Irish Republic, saying, in the \"Treaty Debates\" of 1921–22:\nA conference of nine TDs was deputed to meet privately on 5 January 1922 to resolve the dispute and to achieve a unified front by compromise. The four other anti-Treaty TDs said there was agreement but Mellows did not, and was seen thereafter by pro-Treaty TDs as one of their most implacable opponents. The following day the Dáil voted to approve the Treaty by a majority of 64 to 57. Details on the private conference and the private Dáil session debate were not made public until the 1970s.\n\nHe wrote a social programme based on the Dáil's Democratic Programme of 1919 aimed at winning popular support for the anti-Treaty cause.\n\nMellows was one of the more strident TDs on the approach to the Irish Civil War. On 28 April 1922 he told the Dáil:\n\nIn June 1922, he and fellow republicans Rory O'Connor, Joe McKelvey and Richard Barrett, (among others) entered the Four Courts, which had been occupied by anti-Treaty forces since April. However, they were bombarded by pro-Treaty Free State forces and surrendered after two days. Mellows had a chance to escape along with Ernie O'Malley, but did not take it. (See also Battle of Dublin).\n\nImprisoned in Mountjoy Gaol, Mellows, O'Connor, McKelvey and Barrett were executed by firing squad on 8 December 1922, in reprisal for the shooting of TD Seán Hales (see Executions during the Irish Civil War). These executions and their effects on their fellow prisoners are described in Peadar O'Donnell's Irish Civil War memoir, \"The Gates Flew Open.\"\n\nIn 1922 The Irish Labour Party posthumously published a document entitled \"Liam Mellow's Jail Programme\", based on notes Mellows had smuggled out of jail after being captured by the Irish Free State. In this document, Mellows outlines a 10 point programme he proposed that the Anti-Treaty IRA adopt in 1922:\n\nWriting for An Phoblacht in January of 2010, Sinn Fein's Eoin O'Broin also discussed Mellows' Marxist political positions. In the article, O'Broin quotes Mellows' \"Jail notes\", in which Mellows' applies Marxist theory to Ireland and advocates for a \"People's Republic\". O'Broin concludes the article by suggesting that Sinn Féin should take up these positions.\n\nMellows is commemorated by statues in Eyre Square in Galway, in the official name of the Irish Defence Forces army barracks at Renmore (\"Dún Úi Maoilíosa\") and in the naming of Mellows Bridge in Dublin. He is also commemorated in the names of two GAA clubs (one in Galway, and Castletown Liam Mellows GAA Club in Wexford), and by Unidare RFC in Ballymun and their \"Liam Mellows Perpetual Cup\".\n\nMellows is buried in Castletown cemetery, County Wexford, a few miles from Arklow. An annual commemoration ceremony is held at his grave site, in which a wreath is laid by a member of the Liam Mellows Commemoration committee. \"Liam Mellows Avenue\" in Arklow is named in his honour, as is \"Liam Mellows Street\" in Tuam, County Galway, \"Liam Mellows Park\" in Renmore, Galway and Wexford town, and Mellowes (sic) Road in Finglas, Dublin.\n\nIn 2016, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin TD unveiled a new gravestone for Mellows.\n\nIn December 2019, a memorial statue was unveiled in Finglas, Dublin.\n\n\n"}

In the United Kingdom, during both world wars of the 20th century, the majority of the employees were women. \n\nIn World War I, a filling factory belonging to the Ministry of Munitions was known as a National Filling Factory.\n\nIn World War II, a filling factory belonging to the Ministry of Supply was known as a Royal Filling Factory (RFF), or a Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF). These were all part of the Royal Ordnance Factory organisation, owned by the MoS.\n\nThe filling of smoke screen canisters and other pyrotechnic devices was also carried out by fireworks manufacturers, particularly in World War II, but these are not specifically covered by this article.\n\nThe Filling Factory's raw materials, such as TNT, RDX, or propellants, such as cordite, were manufactured in National Explosives Factories (World War I) or Explosive ROFs (World War II) and transported, by railway trains, to the Filling Factories for filling into munitions, produced at other plants.\n\nHigh-explosives, such as TNT, had to be heated to melt them and the liquid was poured hot into heated shell cases. Care had to be taken to ensure that there were no voids in the poured explosive charge as this could lead to the shell detonating in the gun barrel during firing.\n\nShells and gun cartridges were manufactured in the UK, in World War II, by both the Engineering ROFs and private steel works / forging companies. It is believed that the empty brass cartridge cases for small arms were made at the Small Arms Ammunition Factories.\n\nThe Filling Factories produced their own pyrotechnics, such as fuses and screening smokes; as many of these were sensitive materials. They were then filled or assembled directly into the munitions.\n\nThey also would have sewn cotton bags for filling with primer composition or cordite charges.\n\nFilling factories had a large number of buildings. Buildings were needed on the various Groups for filling of munitions. Explosives magazines were required by each Group to store the incoming explosive materials and to store the outgoing filled shells or gun cartridges, usually packed in ammunition boxes. Storage buildings were also needed on each Group to store the incoming empty shells and the empty ammunition boxes.\n\nFor safety purposes, munitions were segregated into different compatibility Groups. A World War II Filling Factory would generally fill several different Groups of Munitions; and these Groups would be located in different geographical areas within the Danger Area of the Filling Factory.\nThe World War II Groups were:\nIn addition, a Filling Factory would have provision for limited proofing and testing of its munitions; and burning grounds for disposal of waste explosive material.\n\nOutside of this Danger Area, but still within the factory site, would be located:\n\nIt is believed that the Ministry of Munitions owned up to 12 factories.\n\n\nThere were also some additional munitions plants built by the Ministry of Munitions but privately operated:\n\n\nSome of these Filling Factories were temporary \"war duration\" only factories and they closed after the end of World War II.

She was the fourth wife of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who acted as her legal guardian during his third marriage to Henry VIII's sister Mary. Her second husband was Richard Bertie, a member of her household. Following Charles Brandon's death in 1545, it was rumoured that King Henry had considered marrying Catherine as his seventh wife, while he was still married to his sixth wife, Catherine Parr, who was Katherine's close friend.\n\nAn outspoken supporter of the English Reformation, she fled abroad to Wesel and later the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the reign of Queen Mary I, to avoid persecution.\n\nKatherine Willoughby, born at Parham Old Hall, Suffolk, on 22 March 1519 and christened in the church there four days later, was the daughter of William Willoughby, 11th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, and his second wife, María de Salinas. Lord Willoughby's first wife, Mary Hussey, the daughter of William Hussey, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, had died childless before 1512, and in June 1516 he married Maria de Salinas. Dona Maria de Salinas had come to the English court with Henry VIII's Queen consort, Catherine of Aragon, and was one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting and closest friends. The King favoured another match bolstering his own marital alliance with Spain, and even named one of his warships the \"Mary Willoughby\". It seems Katherine was named for the Queen, but her mother's lifelong friendship with Catherine of Aragon did not prevent her daughter from becoming one of England's Marian exiles later in life.\n\nKatherine had two brothers, Henry and Francis, who died as infants.\n\nAccording to Goff, Katherine likely spent her early childhood at Parham, as her mother was in almost constant attendance on Henry VIII's Queen, Catherine of Aragon. On 14 October 1526, when Katherine was seven years of age, Lord Willoughby died after falling ill during a visit to Suffolk, and was buried at Mettingham. As his only surviving child, Katherine inherited the barony. Her father held some thirty manors in Lincolnshire, and almost the same number in Norfolk and Suffolk, worth over £900 per annum, and Katherine is said to have been 'one of the greatest heiresses of her generation'. However her inheritance became a subject of dispute for many years, as there was doubt as to which lands had been settled on the heirs male and which on the heirs general, and the matter was further complicated by a deed which Lord Willoughby had drawn up before leaving for France to campaign in Henry VIII's wars in 1523. In 1527 Katherine's uncle, Sir Christopher Willoughby, accused his sister-in-law, Catherine's mother, Maria de Salinas, of withholding documents from him which established the title to various estates, and of having kept him out of possession of estates which rightfully belonged to him.\n\nAt her father's death, Katherine's wardship fell to the king, who on 1 March 1528 sold it to his brother-in-law, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. On acquiring Katherine's wardship, Suffolk immediately intervened in the family quarrel with a letter to Cardinal Wolsey, and his intervention appears to have cowed Sir Christopher Willoughby, who wrote to Wolsey that the Cardinal's anger was 'worse to him than death'.\n\nKatherine is said to have been betrothed to Henry Brandon, 1st Earl of Lincoln (died 1534), Suffolk's son by his third wife, Mary Tudor. Mary Tudor died at Westhorpe, Suffolk, on 25 June 1533, and on 21 July the young Katherine was one of the chief mourners at her funeral. As early as 1531 it had been rumoured in the household of Henry VIII's future wife, Anne Boleyn, that Suffolk was personally interested in Catherine, and six weeks after Mary Tudor's death the Imperial Ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, reported to Charles V that:\n\nOn Sunday next the Duke of Suffolk will be married to the daughter of a Spanish lady named Lady Willoughby. She was promised to the Duke's son, but he is only ten years old, & although it is not worth writing to your Majesty, the novelty of the case made me mention it'.\n\nAlthough Suffolk was forty-nine and Katherine only fourteen, the marriage was a successful one. The Willoughby inheritance was not fully settled until the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, but Suffolk was able to force Sir Christopher Willoughby to relinquish possession of some of the contested Willoughby estates, and Suffolk eventually became the greatest magnate in Lincolnshire. As such, he played an important role in quelling the Lincolnshire rebellion in 1536, and built an imposing residence at Grimsthorpe, which came into Catherine's possession at the death of Elizabeth de Vere, Dowager Countess of Oxford, widow of the 13th Earl.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess had two sons, Henry Brandon, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, born 18 September 1534 at Catherine's mother's house in the Barbican, and Charles Brandon, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, born 1537. The marriage brought Catherine into the extended royal family, because Henry VIII's will made his younger sister Mary Tudor's descendants the next heirs to the throne after his own children. The Duke and Duchess of Suffolk officially greeted Anne of Cleves when she arrived in England in 1539 to marry the King, and in 1541 they helped arrange a royal progress for the King and his next wife, Catherine Howard. This progress later became notorious for the Queen's alleged adulterous trysts with her kinsman, Thomas Culpeper, though the Duke and Duchess's home at Grimsthorpe Castle was \"one of the very few places on the route ... where Katherine Howard had not misbehaved herself\".\n\nNoted for her wit, sharp tongue, and devotion to learning, by the last years of Henry VIII's reign the Duchess of Suffolk was also an outspoken advocate of the English Reformation. She became a close friend of Henry's last queen, Catherine Parr, particularly after the Duke died in 1545, and was a strong influence on the Queen's religious beliefs. In 1546, as these views grew controversial, the King ordered the Queen's arrest, though his wife managed to cajole him into cancelling this.\n\nThe Duchess of Suffolk once gave a banquet and during a party game afterwards named Bishop Gardiner as the man she loved least. She named her pet spaniel \"Gardiner\", provoking much amusement when she called her dog to heel. Several years later when Gardiner was imprisoned during the reign of King Edward VI, she is quoted as saying, \"It was merry with the lambs when the wolf was shut up.\"\n\nSuffolk died 22 August 1545, and it was rumoured that the King was considering the Duchess – still only in her mid-20s – as his seventh wife. In February 1546, Van der Delft wrote: \"I hesitate to report there are rumours of a new queen. Some attribute it to the sterility of the present Queen, while others say that there will be no change during the present war. Madame Suffolk is much talked about and is in great favour; but the King shows no alteration in his behaviour to the Queen, although she is said to be annoyed by the rumour\". But their friendship remained strong, and after Henry VIII's death in 1547, the Duchess helped fund the publication of one of Catherine Parr's books, \"The Lamentation of a Sinner\". She also became a patron of John Day, England's leading religious publisher; Day printed various books with the Duchess of Suffolk's coat of arms from 1548 onward. Beginning in 1550, the Duchess helped establish stranger churches for foreign Protestants, principally Dutch, who were fleeing religious persecution on the Continent.\n\nThe Dowager Queen Catherine Parr remarried to Thomas Seymour shortly after the death of the King. In August 1548, she gave birth to a daughter and died several days later, presumably of childbed fever. Upon her death, her widower went for London with their new baby daughter. Months later, Seymour was arrested, tried, and executed for treason. Their daughter, Mary, was left an orphan aged only seven months. The Duchess of Suffolk was appointed guardian. The Duchess could not support the young infant so she wrote to Sir William Cecil, asking for funds. The letter reflects her resentment towards the child. The letter was obviously taken into account for in January 1550, an act in Parliament was passed restoring Mary to what was left of her father's property. No claim was ever made and the queen's daughter seems to disappear from history at this time. Parr's biographer Linda Porter believes that the child died and was buried near the Duchess's estate in Grimsthorpe. Years later, the Duchess also became the custodian of one of her Brandon step-granddaughters, Lady Mary Grey, when the latter was placed under house arrest after marrying without royal consent.\n\nIn 1551 both the Duchess's sons, already students at Cambridge, died within an hour of each other of the sweating sickness. Four months afterwards, attempting to reconcile herself to this tragedy, Catherine wrote to Sir William Cecil that 'truly I take this [God's] last (and to the first sight most sharp and bitter) punishment not for the least of his benefits, in as much as I have never been so well taught by any other before to know his power, his love, and mercy, my own wickedness, and that wretched state that without him I should endure here'. In recovering from this misfortune and its severe test to her faith, Catherine built a new life. In this period she employed Hugh Latimer as her chaplain.\n\nShe married her second husband, Richard Bertie (25 December 1516 – 9 April 1582), a member of her household, out of love and shared religious beliefs, but she continued to be known as the Duchess of Suffolk, and her efforts to have her husband named Lord Willoughby de Eresby were unsuccessful. In 1555, during the reign of Queen Mary I, the Berties were among the Marian exiles who left for the Continent. Their persecution by Stephen Gardiner, the Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, and subsequent wanderings were recounted in \"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\", in an account probably written by Richard Bertie himself for the 1570 edition. During this period Sigismund II Augustus, the King of Poland and Duke of Lithuania appointed them as administrators of Lithuania, based at Kražiai.\n\nAfter their return to England, they lived at Katherine's estate, Grimsthorpe in Lincolnshire, and at court. By Richard Bertie, Catherine was the mother of Peregrine Bertie (named for their peregrinations in exile), who married Mary de Vere, only sister of the whole blood of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, and of Susan Bertie, who married firstly, Reginald Grey, 5th Earl of Kent, and secondly, Sir John Wingfield, a nephew of Catherine's friend, Bess of Hardwick.\n\nKatherine and Richard Bertie's exile became the basis of a ballad by Thomas Deloney (1543–1600), \"The most Rare and Excellent History, Of the Duchess of Suffolks Calamity\", and of Thomas Drue's play, \"The Life of the Duchess of Suffolk\", published in 1624. It may also have been the subject of an unpublished play from 1600 by William Haughton, \"The English Fugitives\". Katherine's second marriage to one of her servants and subsequent persecution also present parallels to the plot of John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2218782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218782", "title": "Mental poker", "text": "Mental poker\n\nMental poker is the common name for a set of cryptographic problems that concerns playing a fair game over distance without the need for a trusted third party. The term is also applied to the theories surrounding these problems and their possible solutions. The name comes from the card game poker which is one of the games to which this kind of problem applies. Similar problems described as two party games are Blum's flipping a coin over a distance, Yao's Millionaires' Problem, and Rabin's oblivious transfer.\n\nThe problem can be described thus: \"How can one allow only authorized actors to have access to certain information while not using a trusted arbiter?\" (Eliminating the trusted third-party avoids the problem of trying to determine whether the third party can be trusted or not, and may also reduce the resources required.)\n\nIn poker, this could translate to: \"How can we make sure no player is stacking the deck or peeking at other players' cards when we are shuffling the deck ourselves?\". In a physical card game, this would be relatively simple if the players were sitting face to face and observing each other, at least if the possibility of conventional cheating can be ruled out. However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as online poker, where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, this is impossible unless the method used is such that it cannot allow any party to cheat by manipulating or inappropriately observing the electronic \"deck\".\n\nSeveral protocols for doing this have been suggested, the first by Adi Shamir, Ron Rivest and Len Adleman (the creators of the RSA-encryption protocol). This protocol was the first example of two parties conducting secure computation rather than secure message transmission, employing cryptography; later on due to leaking partial information in the original protocol, this led to the definition of semantic security by Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali. The concept of multi-player mental poker was introduced in Moti Yung's 1984 book Cryptoprotocols. The area has later evolved into what is known as secure multi-party computation protocols (for two parties, and multi parties as well).\n\nOne possible algorithm for shuffling cards without the use of a trusted third party is to use a commutative encryption scheme. A commutative scheme means that if some data is encrypted more than once, the order in which one decrypts this data will not matter.\n\nExample: Alice has a plaintext message. She encrypts this, producing a garbled ciphertext which she gives then to Bob. Bob encrypts the ciphertext again, using the same scheme as Alice but with another key. When decrypting this double encrypted message, if the encryption scheme is commutative, it will not matter who decrypts first.\n\nAn algorithm for shuffling cards using commutative encryption would be as follows:\n\n\nThe deck is now shuffled.\n\nThis algorithm may be expanded for an arbitrary number of players. Players Carol, Dave and so forth need only repeat steps 2-4 and 8-10.\n\nDuring the game, Alice and Bob will pick cards from the deck, identified in which order they are placed in the shuffled deck. When either player wants to see their cards, they will request the corresponding keys from the other player. That player, upon checking that the requesting player is indeed entitled to look at the cards, passes the individual keys for those cards to the other player. The check is to ensure that the player does not try to request keys for cards that do not belong to that player.\n\nExample: Alice has picked cards 1 to 5 in the shuffled deck. Bob has picked cards 6 to 10. Bob requests to look at his allotted cards. Alice agrees that Bob is entitled to look at cards 6 to 10 and gives him her individual card keys A to A. Bob decrypts his cards by using both Alice's keys and his own for these cards, B to B. Bob can now see the cards. Alice cannot know which cards Bob has because she does not have access to Bob's keys B to B which are required to decrypt the cards.\n\nThe encryption scheme used must be secure against known-plaintext attacks: Bob must not be able to determine Alice's original key A (or enough of it to allow him to decrypt any cards he does not hold) based on his knowledge of the unencrypted values of the cards he has drawn. This rules out some obvious commutative encryption schemes, such as simply XORing each card with the key. (Using a separate key for each card even in the initial exchange, which would otherwise make this scheme secure, doesn't work since the cards are shuffled before they're returned.)\n\nDepending on the deck agreed upon, this algorithm may be weak. When encrypting data, certain properties of this data may be preserved from the plaintext to the ciphertext. This may be used to \"tag\" certain cards. Therefore, the parties must agree on a deck where no cards have properties that are preserved during encryption.\n\nChristian Schindelhauer describes sophisticated protocols to both perform and verify a large number of useful operations on cards and stacks of cards in his 1998 paper \"A Toolbox for Mental Card Games\" [SCH98]. The work is concerned with general-purpose operations (masking and unmasking cards, shuffling and re-shuffling, inserting a card into a stack, etc.) that make the protocols applicable to any card game. The cryptographic protocols used by Schindelhauer are based on quadratic residuosity, and the general scheme is similar in spirit to the above protocol. The correctness of operations can be checked by using zero-knowledge proofs, so that players don't need to reveal their strategy to verify the game's correctness.\n\nThe C++ library libtmcg [STA05] provides an implementation of the Schindelhauer toolbox. It has been used to implement a secure version of the German card game Skat, achieving modest real-world performance. The game Skat is played by three players with a 32-card deck, and so is substantially less computationally intensive than a poker game in which anywhere from five to eight players use a full 52-card deck.\n\nTo date, mental poker approaches based on the standard Alice-Bob protocol (above) don't offer high enough performance for real-time online play. The requirement that each player encrypts each card imposes a substantial overhead. A recent paper by Golle [GOL05] describes a mental poker protocol that achieves significantly higher performance by exploiting the properties of the poker game to move away from the encrypt-shuffle model. Rather than shuffle the cards and then deal as needed, with the new approach, the players generate (encrypted) random numbers on the fly, which are used to select the next card. Every new card needs to be checked against all the cards that have already been dealt to detect duplicates. As a result, this method is uniquely useful in poker-style games, in which the number of cards dealt is very small compared to the size of the whole deck. However, the method needs all cards that have already been dealt to be known to all, which in most poker-style games would beat its very purpose.\n\nThe card-generation algorithm requires a cryptosystem with two key properties. The encryption E must be additively homomorphic, so that \"E(c)+E(c) = E(c + c)\". Second, collisions must be detectable, without revealing the plaintext. In other words, given \"E(c)\" and \"E(c)\", it must be possible to answer whether \"c=c\", without the players learning any other information (specifically, the identities of \"c\" and \"c\"). The Elgamal encryption scheme is just one example of a well-known system with these properties.\nThe algorithm operates as follows:\n\nIn this way, the players need only to compute encryption for the cards that are actually used in the game, plus some overhead for the collisions that is small as long as the number of cards needed is much less than the size of the deck. As a result, this scheme turns out to be 2-4 times faster (as measured by the total number of modular exponentiations) than the best-known protocol [JAK99] that does full shuffling using mix-networks.\n\nNote that the random number generation is secure as long as any one player is generating valid random numbers. Even if \"k-1\" players collude to generate the number \"r*\", as long as the \"k\"th player truthfully generates a random formula_3, the sum formula_4 is still uniformly random in {0, 51}.\n\nMeasured in terms of the number of single-agent encryptions, the algorithm in [GOL05] is optimal when no collisions occur, in the sense that any protocol that is fair to every player must perform at least as many encryption operations. At minimum, every agent must encrypt every card that is actually used. Otherwise, if any agent doesn't participate in the encryption, then that agent is susceptible to being cheated by a coalition of the remaining players. Unknown to the non-encrypting agent, the other agents may share the keys to enable them all to know the values of all the cards. Thus, any approach relying on the agents to perform the encryption must focus on schemes that minimize the effect of collisions if they are to achieve better performance.\n\nAny mental poker protocol that relies on the players to perform the encryption is bound by the requirement that every player encrypt every card that is dealt. However, by making limited assumptions about the trustworthiness of third parties, significantly more efficient protocols may be realized. The protocol for choosing cards without shuffling may be adapted so that the encryption is handled by two or more servers. Under the assumption that the servers are non-colluding, such a protocol is secure.\n\nThe basic protocol using two servers is as follows:\n\nIn this protocol, servers \"S1\" and \"S2\" must collude if either is to learn the values of any cards. Furthermore, because players ultimately decide which cards are dealt, non-trustworthy servers are unable to influence the game to the extent that is possible in traditional online poker. The scheme may be extended to allow more servers, (and thus, increased security), simply by including the additional servers in the initial encryption. Finally, step one in the protocol may be done offline, allowing for large numbers of shuffled, encrypted \"decks\" to be pre-computed and cached, resulting in excellent in-game performance.\n\n\n"}

A variety of designs were studied during the lifetime of the project, including most of the early efforts on liquid air cycle engines (LACE) and even a nuclear-powered ramjet.\n\nThe effort was started largely due to the work of Weldon Worth at the Wright-Patterson AFB, who published a short work outlining a manned spaceplane. AF officials were interested enough to start SR-89774 (\"SR\" stands for \"study requirement\") for a reusable spaceplane in 1957. By 1959 this work had resulted in the Recoverable Orbital Launch System, or ROLS, based around a LACE engine, known at the time as a \"Liquid Air Collection System\", or \"LACES\".\n\nFurther work showed that more performance could be gained by extracting only the oxygen from the liquid air, a system they referred to as \"Air Collection and Enrichment System\", or \"ACES\". A contract to develop an ACES testbed was placed with Marquardt and General Dynamics, with Garrett AiResearch building the heat exchanger for cooling the air. The original ACES design was fairly complex; the air was first liquified in the heat exchanger cooled by liquid hydrogen fuel, then pumped into a low-pressure tank for short-term storage. From there it was then pumped into a high-pressure tank, where the oxygen was separated and the rest (mostly nitrogen) was dumped overboard. In late 1960 and early 1961 a 125 N demonstrator engine was being operated for up to 5 minutes at a time.\n\nIn early 1960 Air Force offered a development contract to build a spaceplane with a crew of three that could take off from any runway and fly directly into orbit and return. They wanted the design to be in operation in 1970 for a total development cost of only $5 billion. Boeing, Douglas, Convair, Lockheed, Goodyear, North American, and Republic all responded. Most of these designs ignored the ACES system and instead used a scramjet for power. The scramjet had first been outlined at about the same time as the original LACES design in a NASA paper of 1958, and many companies were highly interested in seeing it develop, perhaps none more than Marquardt, whose ramjet business was dwindling with the introduction of newer jet engines and who had already started work on the scramjet. Both Alexander Kartveli and Antonio Ferri were proponents of the scramjet approach. Ferri successfully demonstrated a scramjet producing net thrust in November 1964, eventually producing , about 80% of his goal.\n\nLater that year a review suggested that the basic concepts of the aerospaceplane were far too new for development of an operational system to begin. They pointed out that far too much was being spent on development of the aircraft, and not nearly enough on basic research. Moreover, the designs were all extremely sensitive to weight, and any increase (and there always is some) could result in all of the designs not working. In 1963 the Air Force changed their priorities in SR-651 and focused entirely on development of a variety of high-speed engines. Included were LACES and ACES engines, as well as scramjets, turboramjets and a \"normal\" (subsonic-combustion) ramjet with an intake suitable for use up to Mach 8. In October a further review concluded that the technology was simply too new for anyone to predict when any such aerospaceplane could ever be built, and funding was wound down in 1964.\n\n"}

{"id": "2218807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218807", "title": "Conestoga River", "text": "Conestoga River\n\nThe Conestoga River, also referred to as Conestoga Creek, is a tributary of the Susquehanna River flowing through the center of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States.\n\nIts headwaters rise mostly in southern Berks County and northeastern Lancaster County, in an area known as \"Bortz's Swamp\" or \"Penngall Field\" (a small area rises in Chester County). The East Branch and West Branch of the Conestoga join to form the main river just north of Morgantown, and the stream flows from northeast to southwest for more than , passing close to the center of Lancaster and ending at Safe Harbor along the Susquehanna River, approximately north of the Pennsylvania-Maryland state line.\n\nThe principal tributaries of the Conestoga River are Cocalico Creek, Mill Creek, and Little Conestoga Creek; they drain into the Conestoga River watershed in the order listed. The Conestoga River and its principal tributaries comprise approximately 114 stream miles, and they drain a watershed area of approximately if the main stream is alone considered, rising to when the Cocalico, Mill, and Little Conestoga Creek watersheds are also included.\n\nThe stream was named after a small tribe of the indigenous Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock people, called the Susquehannocks by the English of Maryland and Virginia (an Algonquian name, \"Sasquesahanough\", meaning \"people of the muddy river\") and the Conestoga by the English of Pennsylvania (from \"Kanastoge\", meaning \"place of the immersed pole\", the name of their village in Pennsylvania). The village of Conestoga was reported to have two thousand inhabitants in the 17th century, and up to seven thousand people or more may have then lived in the watershed of the Conestoga River. By the early 18th century most of the Conestoga-Susquehannock were compelled to move to the Ohio area, where they gradually lost their distinctiveness as a nation. In 1763 the remaining Susquehannocks at Conestoga were attacked by the Paxton Boys, a group of anti-Indian vigilantes, who killed six of them at their village of Conestoga, and, two weeks later, despite official protection, killed fourteen of the remaining sixteen at the Lancaster workhouse. The two surviving Conestoga-Susquehannock worked as servants on a local farm until they died and were buried there.\n\nThe first steamboat in America floated on the stream in 1763. In the 19th century the name of the stream gained wider recognition with the spread of the Conestoga wagon, first built in and named after this valley. The wagon assisted the transportation of freight throughout the east, and later was adapted to help transport goods to the western frontier of the United States. So many cigars were made in the watershed in the late 19th century that a local cigar named the Conestoga became known as the \"stogie\" throughout the US. In the early nineteenth century, it was possible to travel by boat to Lancaster city from the Chesapeake Bay through a system of locks. Though the stream is hardly the size generally designated a river, local boosterism in the late 19th century insisted that any stream holding scheduled commercial transport should be so called; steamboat service to a local amusement park along its banks (Rocky Springs Amusement Park in Lancaster,Pa) barely qualified, but the designation caught on. The name Conestoga has also been applied to the Conestoga Rocket, a rocket produced from Minuteman I parts and launched from Matagorda Island, the ship \"Conestoga\", which is a popular diving wreck in the Thousand Islands, the C-93 Conestoga cargo aircraft, and, in \"Star Trek\", the name of the starship used in the failed first attempt at deep space colonization.\n\nLand use along the stream has been traditionally agricultural, though spreading urbanization has affected the stream with erosion problems. Though extremely scenic, the Conestoga River is drastically impaired from nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, mostly runoff from animal waste and excessive commercial fertilizer. Other pollution sources are sediments from intense cropping, development, and urban runoff. The stream flows through a pastoral landscape farmed extensively by Pennsylvania German farmers and along the eastern and southern outskirts of the city of Lancaster. Many covered bridges span its banks. Northeast of Lancaster city are many Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite farms; horse and carriage traffic frequents local roads. Many small dams impound its waters, most of them built long ago to power mills or generate electricity. Most dams are in disrepair and have been abandoned, though there is an active movement to remove as many as possible. Seven were removed between 1996 and 1999.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2218811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218811", "title": "Southern hairy-nosed wombat", "text": "Southern hairy-nosed wombat\n\nThe southern hairy-nosed wombat (\"Lasiorhinus latifrons\") is one of three extant species of wombats. It is found in scattered areas of semiarid scrub and mallee from the eastern Nullarbor Plain to the New South Wales border area. It is the smallest of all three wombat species. The young often do not survive dry seasons. It is the state animal of South Australia.\n\nAmong the oldest southern hairy-nosed wombats ever documented were a male and a female from Brookfield Zoo just outside Chicago. Their names were Carver, who lived to be 34, and his mother, Vicky, who lived to be 24. In South Australia in 2010, a domesticated wombat named Wally was also reported as having reached the age of 34. Hamlet, a wombat at the Toronto Zoo, similarly died at age 34.\n\nThe southern hairy-nosed wombat is adapted to digging; it has a stocky and robust build, flattened claws, and five digits. It is also plantigrade. The body length ranges from with a body mass ranging from . Its short tail is hidden by its fur. The pelage is silky and is typically greyish or tan in colour. The wombat grooms itself with its second and third toes, which are fused together, except at the tips. The head is robust and flattened and the ears are pointed. The snout resembles that of a pig. The animal gets its name from the hairs that cover its rhinarium.\nThe wombat's incisors resemble those of rodents, and its molars are widely spaced by the palate. The teeth keep growing for the entirety of the animal’s life, which is likely an adaptation to its harsh diet. Compared to the common wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat has a larger temporalis muscle and a smaller masseter muscle. Also, unlike the northern hairy-nosed wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat’s nasal bone is longer than the frontal bone.\n\nSouthern hairy-nosed wombats range though Western Australia, southern South Australia, and south-western New South Wales. They live in semiarid to arid grasslands and woodlands.\n\nSouthern hairy-nosed wombats, along with other wombat species, select native perennial grasses and sedges, but do consume introduced pasture species, forbs, and the leaves of woody shrubs if their favoured food is not available. Much of the southern hairy-nosed wombat's diet is \"Austrostipa nitida\", which grows around its warren complex and is trimmed as it grazes. This creates an area with a higher density of new green shoots, a sign of delayed growth of individual grass. The teeth of the wombat are more effective in grinding food into small particles than the western grey kangaroo. Its digestive tract has a tiny caecum and a colon divided into parts. The anterior part is relatively small and serves as the site for fermentation, while the posterior part is larger and is where water is reabsorbed. The wombat conserves water by recycling more urea to the colon rather than releasing it as urine. Wombats release less than other herbivorous mammals. As such, the southern hairy-nosed wombat produces very dry faeces, with water contents as low as 40%.\n\nThe harsh environment in which the southern hairy-nosed wombat lives is further reflected in its energetics. In captivity, their standard metabolic rate was found to be 130 kl/kg^0.75 per day, which is very low compared to most placental animals and other marsupials. They also have the lowest thyroid hormone levels among mammals. The food wombats eat provides more than enough energy. As long as enough food is available, the forage consumed by the wombat can support it during late lactation. It is more effective than a donkey at maintaining its weight on low-quality food.\n\nSouthern hairy-nosed wombats dig and live in burrows which they connect into warrens with many entrances. These warrens are their prime refuges and are shared by up to 10 individuals. A wombat digs with its fore claws while sitting up. It leaves its new burrow backwards and pushes out soil with all its paws. The central warren is surrounded by a circle of small, simple burrows 100–150 m from it. The small burrows along the outer edges is where young wombats go when they are displaced from the central warren. Wombats may favour a certain burrow and not share it with others. However, there is no monopolization of burrows. Wombats move between burrows and even warrens. Male wombats are territorial towards wombats from other warrens, possibly to defend food resources and the warren refuges. Trails of droppings connect the burrows. The males also mark their territory with anal scent secretions by rubbing their backs and rumps on objects. Fights between males over territories or mates do occur and involve bites to the ears, flanks, or rumps. Also, a dominance hierarchy exists among males.\n\nThe burrows of a southern hairy-nosed wombat can have air temperatures around of 14 °C in midwinter to 26 °C in midsummer, the wombat's preferred thermo-neutral zone, while the ambient temperatures outside range from down to around 2 °C in Winter and up to 36 °C or above during Summer. Warrens can make surface conditions in habitats of low humidity and high temperatures better for the wombat. A wombat retires deep in the burrow after foraging. The next night, the wombat moves to the entrance to check if conditions are right before emerging again. In the evening, wombats leave their burrows as the ambient temperature and burrow temperature are the same. In the early morning, when the surface temperature is lower, they retire.\n\nThe breeding of the southern hairy-nosed wombat occurs when their favoured food is at its peak growth rates. Their reproduction relies on the winter rainfall, which germinates the grasses. Between August and October, when rainfall is sufficient, females enter ovulation and the males' testosterone levels and prostate gland sizes increase. In years of low rainfall, neither occurs. When breeding, dominance hierarchies among males are established through aggression. Copulation takes place in the warren, with males remaining in one burrow and females moving among them. Mating takes place underground and involves the male mounting the female from behind while she is on her side. The gestation period of the wombat lasts 22 days and most births occur in October. When a young is born, it climbs into the pouch and clings to a teat. It stays in the pouch for six months growing to around 0.45 kg, with a light pelage and open eyes. It soon leaves the pouch and starts grazing at the surface. The young is fully weaned when it is a year old and reaches full size at the age of three years, which is also when it becomes sexually mature.\n\nSouthern hairy-nosed wombats use vocalisations and scents for communication. While most communication between wombats occurs through olfaction and scent-marking, as they do not often encounter each other directly, they emit rough, coughing noises when they pass each other, and emit a more strident call for alarm.\n\nThe southern hairy-nosed wombat was listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN in 2016, because \"many subpopulations are now isolated and may be non-viable\". It was previously listed as Least Concern because \"While there are sporadic outbreaks of sarcoptic mange, competition with introduced herbivores, susceptibility to drought, and severe fragmentation in parts of its range, the species has a wide distribution, large population, occurs in a number of protected areas, and it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category\". Wombats were hunted by aboriginal people for their meat. However, capturing a wombat takes considerable time and energy, so they were not hunted too frequently. The indigenous people of Australia value the wombat culturally and keep their local wombat populations healthy by hunting wombats in other areas.\n\nWombats have been considered as agricultural pests by landholders. Their digging can destroy crops and can increase the risk of livestock breaking their legs by falling through their burrow systems. Competition between livestock, rabbits, and wombats can lead to overgrazing. Overgrazing and the spread of invasive weeds in some areas has led to the flora being dominated by annual grass and weed species, from which wombats cannot get enough of their metabolic needs, resulting in reports of emaciation and mass starvation. The competition from introduced rabbits threatens the survival of wombats.\n\n"}
{"id": "2218814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218814", "title": "Northern hairy-nosed wombat", "text": "Northern hairy-nosed wombat\n\nThe northern hairy-nosed wombat (\"Lasiorhinus krefftii\") is one of three extant species of wombats. It is one of the rarest land mammals in the world and is critically endangered. Its historical range extended across New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland as recently as 100 years ago, but it is now restricted to one place, a 3-km range within the 32-km Epping Forest National Park in Queensland. In 2003, the total population consisted of 113 individuals, including only around 30 breeding females. In the last census taken in 2013, the estimated population was 196 individuals, with an additional 9 individuals at the Richard Underwood Nature Refuge at Yarran Downs near St. George in southern Queensland. In recent years, the population has experienced a slow but steady increase to an estimated 230 individuals in 2015.\n\nIn general, all species of wombat are heavily built, with large heads and short, powerful legs. They have strong claws to dig their burrows, where they live much of the time. It usually takes about a day for an individual to dig a burrow.\n\nNorthern hairy-nosed wombats have bodies covered in soft, grey fur; the fur on their noses sets them apart from the common wombat. They have longer, more pointed ears and a much broader muzzle than the other two species. Individuals can be 35 cm high, up to 1 m long and weigh up to 40 kg. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with females being somewhat larger than males due to the presence of an extra layer of fat. They are slightly larger than the common wombat and able to breed somewhat faster (giving birth to two young every three years on average).\n\nThe northern hairy-nosed wombat's nose is very important in its survival because it has very poor eyesight, so it must detect its food in the dark through smell. Examination of the wombat's digestive tract shows that the elastic properties of the ends of their large intestines are capable of turning liquid excrement into cubical scat.\n\nThe northern hairy-nosed wombat is nocturnal, living underground in networks of burrows. They avoid coming above ground during harsh weather, as their burrows maintain a constant humidity and temperature. They have been known to share burrows with up to 10 individuals, equally divided by sex. Young are usually born during the wet season, between November and April. When rain is abundant, 50-80% of the females in the population will breed, giving birth to one offspring at a time. Juveniles stay in their mothers' pouches for 8 to 9 months, and are weaned at 12 months of age.\n\nThe fat reserves and low metabolic rate of this species permit northern hairy-nosed wombats to go without food for several days when food is scarce. Even when they do feed every day, it is only for 6 hours a day in the winter and 2 hours in the summer, significantly less than a similar-sized kangaroo, which feeds for at least 18 hours a day. Their diet consists of native grasses: black speargrass (\"Heteropogon contortus\"), bottle washer grasses (\"Enneapogon\" spp.), golden beard grass (\"Chrysopogon fallax\"), and three-awned grass(\"Aristida\" spp.), as well as various types of roots. The teeth continue to grow beyond the juvenile period, and are worn down by the abrasive grasses they eat.. Its habitat has become infested with African buffel grass, a grass species introduced for cattle grazing. The grass outcompetes the more nutritional and native grasses on which the wombat prefers to feed by limiting its quantity, forcing the wombat to travel further to find the native grasses it prefers, and leading to a reduction in biomass.\n\nThe genus name \"Lasiorhinus\" comes from the Latin words \"lasios\", meaning hairy or shaggy, and \"\", meaning nose. The widely accepted common name is northern hairy-nosed wombat, based on the historical range of the species, as well as the fur, or \"whiskers\", on its nose. In some older literature, it is referred to as the Queensland hairy-nosed wombat.\n\nThe northern hairy-nosed wombat shares its genus with one other extant species, the southern hairy-nosed wombat, while the common wombat is in the genus \"Vombatus\". Both \"Lasiorhinus\" species differ morphologically from the common wombat by their silkier fur, broader hairy noses, and longer ears.\n\nThe koala is the most closely related marsupial to wombats, and is categorised in the same suborder, Vombatiformes.\n\nThreats to the northern hairy-nosed wombat include small population size, predation, competition for food, disease, floods, droughts, wildfires, and habitat loss. Its small, highly localised population makes the species especially vulnerable to natural disasters. Originally there were two main groups of hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) that were separated by Spencer Gulf in Australia, both species experienced a population decline between 1870 and 1920, with the main influences of competition for food, competition, and predation. Wild dogs are the wombat's primary predator. As well, rabbits and the actions of land owners have contributed to the decline of these wombats. The necessity to control rabbits through methods that do not harm wombats can combat wombat decline. The habitat at Epping Forest National Park is now well-protected for better chances of survival.\n\nDue to these threats, the northern hairy-nosed wombat is listed as \"endangered\" by the Australian Species Profile and Threats Database (SPRAT), and \"critically endangered\" by the IUCN.\nIts range is restricted to about 300 ha (750 acres) of the Epping National Forest in east-central Queensland, 120 km northwest of Clermont.\n\nIn 2003, researchers performed a study to analyse the demography of the northern hairy-nosed wombat. In the study, researchers used double-sided tape in the burrows to collect hair of the wombats. Through DNA analysis, they found that the ratio of female to male NHN wombats was 0.308 out of 113 wombats. These findings allowed researchers to understand the demographics of the NHN wombat and opened up further research to better understand why there is a significant difference in males and females in the wild.\n\nThere have been two reports of male northern hairy-nosed wombats contracting a fungal infection caused by \"Emmonsia parva,\" a soil saprophytic fungus. It is likely that the northern hairy-nosed wombats are inhaling the infection from the soil. These 2 case studies provide insightful new information on how we can prevent further deaths.\n\nTo combat the vulnerability of this species, a number of conservation projects have been put into action over recent years. One example was the construction of a two-metre-high, predator-proof fence around 25 km of the park in 2000. A second, insurance colony of this species of wombat has been established at Richard Underwood Nature Refuge at Yarran Downs near St. George in southern Queensland. This second population was established in 2008 and is also in a reserve surrounded by a predator-proof fence. Within Epping Forest National Park, increased attention and funds have been given for wombat research and population monitoring, fire management, maintenance of the predator-proof fence, general management, and control of predators and competitors, and elimination of invasive plant species. In addition, the species recovery plan of 2004 to 2008 included communication and community involvement in saving the species and worked to increase the current population in the wild, established other populations within the wombat's historical range, and worked with zoos to establish a captive husbandry program. Also, a volunteer caretaker program allows volunteers to contribute in monitoring the population and keeping the predator fence in good repair. Finally, DNA fingerprint identification of wombat hairs allows research to be conducted without an invasive trapping or radio-tracking program. Due to the combined efforts of these forces, the northern hairy-nosed wombat population is slowly making a comeback.\n"}

The common wombat grows to an average of long and a weight of .\n\nThe common wombat was first described by George Shaw in 1800. Three subspecies are noted, though their distinctness is somewhat uncertain:\nHackett's wombat (\"Vombatus hacketti\") was the other species in the genus, inhabiting the southwest of Australia. Being around the same size as \"V. ursinus\", with an average weight of 30 kg\",\" \"V. hacketti\" went extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene, in the Quaternary extinction event.\n\nCommon wombats are widespread in the cooler and better-watered parts of southern and eastern Australia, including Tasmania, and in mountain districts as far north as the south of Queensland, but is declining in western Victoria and South Australia.\n\nCommon wombats can be found at any elevation in the south of their range, but in the north of their range are only found in higher, more mountainous areas. They may be found in a variety of habitats including rainforest, eucalyptus forest, woodland, alpine grassland, and coastal areas. In some regions, they have adapted to farmland and can even be seen grazing in open fields with cattle and sheep.\n\nCommon wombats are sturdy and built close to the ground. When fully grown, they can reach between 80 and 130 cm, and weigh between 17 and 40 kg. The wombats found on Tasmania and Flinders Island are often smaller than their mainland counterparts. It is distinguished from both hairy-nosed wombats by its bald nose.\n\nCommon wombats are a solitary, territorial species, with each wombat having an established range in which it lives and feeds. In this area, they dig a tunnel system, with tunnels ranging from 2 to 20 m in length, along with many side tunnels. Usually, only one entrance to the burrow exists, although they may create a smaller one with which to escape. \n\nRecent bushfires in Australia's Eastern and South Eastern areas showed that burrows are frequently much longer than originally thought, with some having over 20 entrances and that many wombat burrows were used by other species including the rock wallaby and the swamp wallaby, to shelter from the bushfires. It was not clear whether this was with the approval of the \"owner\" or whether sheltering species had found an unpopulated burrow.\n\nMany wombats can live in the same burrow, and wombats normally live in the same burrow for their whole lifespan unless the wombat is forced out of the burrow by farmers or other animal species, or unless the burrow is destroyed. Often nocturnal, the common wombat does come out during the day in cooler weather, such as in early morning or late afternoon.\n\nCommon wombats are herbivorous, subsisting on grass, snow tussocks, and other plant materials. Foraging is usually done during the night. They are the only marsupial in the world whose teeth constantly grow which allows them to maintain a diet consisting of mainly native grasses.\n\nThe common wombat can breed every two years and produce a single joey. The gestation period is about 20–30 days, and the young remain in the pouch for five months. When leaving the pouch, they weigh between . The joey is weaned around 12 to 15 months of age, and is usually independent at 18 months of age. Wombats have an average lifespan of 15 years in the wild and 20 years in captivity.\n"}

{"id": "2218843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218843", "title": "Antitheism", "text": "Antitheism\n\nAntitheism (sometimes anti-theism) is the opposition to theism. The term has had a range of applications. In secular contexts, it typically refers to direct opposition to the belief in any deity.\n\nThe word \"antitheism\" (or hyphenated \"anti-theism\") has been recorded in English since 1788. The etymological roots of the word are the Greek \"anti\" and \"theos.\"\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines \"antitheist\" as \"One opposed to belief in the existence of a god\". The earliest citation given for this meaning dates from 1833. \"Antitheism\" has been adopted as a label by those who regard theism as dangerous, destructive, or encouraging of harmful behavior. Christopher Hitchens offers an example of this approach in \"Letters to a Young Contrarian\" (2001), in which he writes: \"I'm not even an atheist so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful.\"\n\nOther definitions of antitheism include that of the French Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain (1953), for whom it is \"an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God\" (p. 104), and that of Robert Flint (1877), Professor of Divinity at the University of Edinburgh. Flint's Baird Lecture for 1877 was entitled \"Anti-Theistic Theories\". He used it as a very general umbrella term for all opposition to his own form of theism, which he defined as the \"belief that the heavens and the earth and all that they contain owe their existence and continuance to the wisdom and will of a supreme, self-existent, omnipotent, omniscient, righteous, and benevolent Being, who is distinct from, and independent of, what He has created.\" He wrote:\n\nIn dealing with theories which have nothing in common except that they are antagonistic to theism, it is necessary to have a general term to designate them. Anti-theism appears to be the appropriate word. It is, of course, much more comprehensive in meaning than the term atheism. It applies to all systems which are opposed to theism. It includes, therefore, atheism, but short of atheism, there are anti-theistic theories. Polytheism is not atheism, for it does not deny that there is a deity; but it is anti-theistic since it denies that there is only one. Pantheism is not atheism, for it asserts that there is a god; but it is anti-theism, for it denies that God is a being distinct from creation and possessed of such attributes as wisdom, and holiness, and love. Every theory which refuses to ascribe to a god an attribute which is essential to a worthy conception of its character is anti-theistic. Only those theories which refuse to acknowledge that there is evidence even for the existence of a god are atheistic.\n\nHowever, Flint also acknowledges that antitheism is typically understood differently from how he defines it. In particular, he notes that it has been used as a subdivision of atheism, descriptive of the view that theism has been disproven, rather than as the more general term that Flint prefers. He rejects \"non-theistic\" as an alternative, \"not merely because of its hybrid origin and character, but also because it is far too comprehensive. The theories of physical and mental science are non-theistic, even when in no degree, directly or indirectly, antagonistic to theism.\"\n\nOpposition to the existence of a god or gods is frequently referred to as dystheism, which would actually mean \"belief in a deity that is not benevolent\", or misotheism – strictly speaking, this means \"hatred of God\". Examples of belief systems founded on the principle of opposition to the existence of a god or gods include some forms of Atheistic Satanism and maltheism.\n\nAnother use of the term \"antitheism\" was coined by Christopher New in a thought experiment published in 1993. In his article, he imagines what arguments for the existence of an evil god would look like: \"Antitheists, like theists, would have believed in an omnipotent, omniscient, eternal creator; but whereas theists in fact believe that the supreme being is also perfectly good, antitheists would have believed that he was perfectly evil.\" New's usage has reappeared in the work of Wallace A. Murphree.\n\n"}

He went 10-2 with a 2.79 earned run average and led the Carolina League with 126 strikeouts with the Lynchburg Mets in his second professional season.\n\nAllen came up with the Mets as a starting pitcher in 1979, and he made his major league debut on April 15 against the Philadelphia Phillies and former Met Nino Espinosa, giving up three runs in six innings and taking the loss. Allen was 0-5 as a starter when the Mets moved him to the bullpen. He won his next four decisions in a row as a reliever, and on July 28, he earned his first major league save.\n\nSoon Allen emerged as the club's closer, earning eight saves by the end of the season and 69 total in his Mets career. In May 1981, the Mets reached a deal to acquire Ellis Valentine from the Montreal Expos for Dan Norman and either Allen or Jeff Reardon. Unwilling to part with their closer, the Mets sent Reardon to the Expos.\n\nAllen got off to a rough start to the season. With Allen's record standing at 0-4 with a 5.68 ERA and a .301 batting average against, the Mets made the unusual decision to converted Allen back into a starter. As unconventional as this move was, it seemed to work. Allen won his first two decisions, including a shutout of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Two weeks later, on June 15, he and Rick Ownbey were traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Keith Hernandez.\nAllen's first start as a Cardinal came against the Mets at Shea Stadium. He held the Mets to four hits with six strikeouts (2 of Hernandez) over eight innings, and drove in one of the Cardinals' six runs. His second win for the Cards also came against his former club. This time, he held them to one run over seven innings. He also had an RBI double, and scored a run in the second inning. All told, he went 3-0 with a 0.87 ERA against the Mets in 1983. Against the rest of the National League, he was 9-13 with a 4.76 ERA.\n\nIn 1984, he was returned to the bullpen, making only one emergency start. By 1985, the Mets and Cardinals had become archrivals atop the National League East. Hernandez emerged as a leader of his new team, and had become a fan favorite in New York City. Allen, meanwhile, was 1-4 with a 5.59 earned run average, and began incurring the wrath of Cardinals fans. On July 16, he was sold to the New York Yankees. Allen was 1-0 with one save and a 2.76 ERA out of the Yankees' bullpen.\n\nFollowing the '85 season, Allen was traded to the Chicago White Sox with Scott Bradley and Glen Braxton for Ron Hassey, Matt Winters, Chris Alvarez and Eric Schmidt. The ChiSox converted him back to a starter, and he earned his first win of the season against Ron Guidry at Yankee Stadium on May 15. Allen gave up only one earned run, four hits and two walks in seven innings for the first White Sox victory over Guidry at Yankee Stadium since August 13, 1980.\n\nHis next start at Yankee Stadium was even better. On July 20, Allen pitched a complete game two hitter to lead the White Sox to an 8-0 victory over the Yankees. For the season, Allen went 7-2 with a 3.82 ERA.\n\nThe White Sox released Allen during the 1987 season after he posted an 0-7 record and 7.07 ERA. He signed with the Yankees for the remainder of the season, and returned again for 1988. He signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians in 1989, making three appearances for the big league club. He pitched for the Cincinnati Reds' AAA affiliate, the Nashville Sounds in 1990 before retiring.\n\nAllen was an above average fielding pitcher. He did not commit an error from 1983 to 1986.\n\nAllen began coaching shortly after his retirement. After a brief stint in the independent Texas–Louisiana League as pitching coach with the Mobile BaySharks, Allen joined the Toronto Blue Jays in 1996 as pitching coach of their New York–Penn League affiliate, the St. Catharines Stompers.\n\nAfter four seasons with the Jays' organization, Allen returned to the Yankees in 2000 as pitching coach of the Staten Island Yankees. He was pitching coach for the Columbus Clippers from 2003 to 2004, and returned to that position again in 2006 after serving as the bullpen pitching coach for the New York Yankees during the 2005 season. Allen, while the Columbus Clippers pitching coach, introduced Chien-Ming Wang's sinker, which became his signature pitch.\n\nIn 2007, he joined the Rays' organization, working in their minor league system with his final stop as the pitching coach for the Durham Bulls.\n\nIn November 2014, the Minnesota Twins hired him as their major league pitching coach.\n\nOn May 26, 2016, Allen was booked into Hennepin County jail on suspicion of DUI and suspended indefinitely by the Twins. After he completed a five-week outpatient treatment program at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation that the team had checked him in to, the Twins brought him back in early July. \n\nAt the end of the 2017 season, Allen retired from his coaching career, and did not return to the Twins in 2018.\n\n, or The Ultimate Mets Database\n"}
{"id": "2218848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218848", "title": "Musica poetica", "text": "Musica poetica\n\nMusica poetica was a term commonly applied to the art of composing music in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century German schools and universities. Its first known use was in the \"Rudimenta Musicae Planae\" (Wittenberg: 1533) of Nicolaus Listenius. Previously, music had been divided into musica theoretica and musica practica, which were categorised with the quadrivium and trivium, respectively. Since music of the time primarily meant vocal music, it was natural for theorists to make analogies between the composition of music and the composition of oratory or poetry. Hence, the term \"musica poetica\".\n\nAnalogies between music and the rhetorical arts were made on several levels. Gallus Dressler (1563) suggested to liken the structure of a musical composition with that of a speech, as outlined in Classical sources, dividing it into such sections as exordium, medium and finis (literally, \"beginning\", \"middle\" and \"end\"). Another kind of analogy was to liken the rules or grammar of composition with those of speech, as illustrated by Joachim Burmeister's use of \"tautoëpia\" to label consecutive fifths and octaves (which were generally regarded as illegal except in special circumstances). \n\nMost significantly, though, special melodic, harmonic, or technical devices in music began to be associated with the figures of Classical oratory: for example, a rising or falling sequence in music was usually called climax in the literature of \"musica poetica\". However, it must be pointed out that such analogies were not always direct: terms used in \"musica poetica\" do not always correspond equivalently to their rhetorical counterparts (for example, in oratory, \"anaphora\" means a straightforward repetition of a word, but in music it can denote various kinds of repetitive device, such as the development of a subject through imitation (fugue); also, the presence of a rhetorical figure in the text being set to music did not imply an automatic application of that figure's musical equivalent (that is, it was never mandatory for composers to respond to such verbal ideas as \"going up\" with rising musical phrases (known as \"anabasis\" or \"ascensus\" in \"musica poetica\"). \n\nA knowledge of both Classical rhetoric and \"musica poetica\" can greatly enhance the listener's understanding and appreciation of works composed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, especially by such figures as Heinrich Schütz and Giacomo Carissimi. However, it is also important not to seek examples of musical figures on every page; while rhetoric and musical theory were strongly associated, the nature of this association was complex and variable.\n\nJones, T.D.: \"Passions in Perspective: An Analytical Discussion of the Three Passion Settings of Heinrich Schütz (1585-1672) against their Historical and Stylistic Backgrounds\", (Ph.D. thesis, University of Birmingham, UK, 2000).\n"}

{"id": "2218869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218869", "title": "Finnic languages", "text": "Finnic languages\n\nThe Finnic (Fennic) or Balto-Finnic (Balto-Fennic; Baltic Finnic, \"Baltic Fennic\") languages are a branch of the Uralic language family spoken around the Baltic Sea by Finnic peoples. There are around 7 million speakers who live mainly in Finland and Estonia.\n\nTraditionally, eight Finnic languages have been recognized. The major modern representatives of the family are Finnish and Estonian, the official languages of their respective nation states. The other Finnic languages in the Baltic Sea region are Ingrian and Votic, spoken in Ingria by the Gulf of Finland; and Livonian, once spoken around the Gulf of Riga. Spoken farther northeast are Karelian, Ludic and Veps, in the region of Lakes Onega and Ladoga.\n\nIn addition, since the 1990s, several Finnic-speaking minority groups have emerged to seek recognition for their languages as distinct from the ones they have been considered dialects of in the past. Some of there groups have established their own orthographies and standardised languages. Võro and Seto, which are spoken in southeastern Estonia and in some parts of Russia, have been considered dialects of Estonian in the past but modern day linguistics consider them their own languages. Meänkieli and Kven are spoken in northern Sweden and Norway respectively and have the legal status of independent minority languages. They were earlier considered dialects of Finnish and are somewhat mutually intelligible with it, depending on the dialect. Additionally the Karelian language wasn't officially recognised as its own language in Finland until 2009 despite there being no linguistic confusion about its status.\n\nThe smaller languages are endangered. The last native speaker of Livonian died in 2013, and only about a dozen native speakers of Votic remain. Regardless, even for these languages, the shaping of a standard language and education in it continues.\n\nThe geographic centre of the maximum divergence between the languages is located east of the Gulf of Finland around Saint Petersburg. A glottochronological study estimates the age of the common ancestor of existing languages to a little more than 1000 years. However, Mikko Heikkilä dates the beginning of the diversification (with South Estonian as the first split) rather precisely to about 150 AD, based on loanword evidence (and previous estimates tend to be even older, like Pekka Sammallahti's of 1000–600 BC). There is now wide agreement that Proto-Finnic was probably spoken at the coasts of the Gulf of Finland.\n\nThe Finnic languages are located at the western end of the Uralic language family. A close affinity to their northern neighbors, the Sami languages, has long been assumed, though many of the similarities (particularly lexical ones) can be shown to result from common influence from Germanic languages and, to a lesser extent, Baltic languages. Innovations are also shared between Finnic and the Mordvinic languages, and in recent times Finnic, Samic and Mordvinic are frequently considered together.\n\nThere is no grammatical gender in any of the Finnic languages, nor are there articles or definite or indefinite forms.\n\nThe morphophonology (the way the grammatical function of a morpheme affects its production) is complex. Morphological elements found in the Finnic languages include grammatical case suffixes, verb tempus, mood and person markers (singular and plural, the Finnic languages don't have dual) as well as participles and several infinitive forms, possessive suffixes, clitics and more. The number of grammatical cases tends to be high while the number of verb infinitive forms varies more by language.\n\nOne of the more important processes is the characteristic consonant gradation. Two kinds of gradation occur: radical gradation and suffix gradation. They both affect the plosives , and , and involve the process known as lenition, in which the consonant is changed into a \"weaker\" form. This occurs in some (but not all) of the oblique case forms. For geminates, the process is simple to describe: they become simple stops, e.g. \"kuppi\" + \"-n\" → \"kupin\" (Finnish: \"cup\"). For simple consonants, the process complicates immensely and the results vary by the environment. For example, \"haka\" + \"-n\" → \"haan\", \"kyky\" + \"-n\" → \"kyvyn\", \"järki\" + \"-n\" → \"järjen\" (Finnish: \"pasture\", \"ability\", \"intellect\"). The specifics of consonants gradation vary by language (see the separate article for more details). Apocope (strongest in Livonian, Võro and Estonian) has, in some cases, left a phonemic status to the phonological variation in the stem (variation caused by the now historical morphological elements), which results in three phonemic lengths in these languages.\n\nVowel harmony is also characteristic of the Finnic languages, despite having been lost in Livonian, Estonian and Veps. \n\nThe original Uralic palatalization was lost in proto-Finnic, but most of the diverging dialects reacquired it. Palatalization is a part of the Estonian literary language and is an essential feature in Võro, as well as Veps, Karelian, and other eastern Finnic languages. It is also found in East Finnish dialects, and is only missing from West Finnish dialects and Standard Finnish.\n\nA special characteristic of the languages is the large number of diphthongs. There are 16 diphthongs in Finnish and 25 in Estonian; at the same time the frequency of diphthong use is greater in Finnish than in Estonian due to certain historical long vowels having diphthongised in Finnish but not in Estonian. On a global scale the Finnic languages have a high number of vowels.\n\nThe Finnic languages form a complex dialect continuum with few clear-cut boundaries. Innovations have often spread through a variety of areas, even after variety-specific changes.\nA broad twofold conventional division of the Finnic varieties recognizes the Southern Finnic and Northern Finnic groups (though the position of some varieties within this division is uncertain):\n\n† = extinct variety; (†) = moribund variety.\n\nA more-or-less genetic subdivision can be also determined, based on the relative chronology of sound changes within varieties, which provides a rather different view. The following grouping follows among others Sammallahti (1977), Viitso (1998), and Kallio (2014):\n\nThe division between South Estonian and the remaining Finnic varieties has isoglosses that must be very old. For the most part, these features have been known for long. Their position as very early in the relative chronology of Finnic, in part representing archaisms in South Estonian, has been shown by Kallio (2007, 2014).\n\nHowever, due to the strong areal nature of many later innovations, this tree structure has been distorted and sprachbunds have formed. In particular, South Estonian and Livonian show many similarities with the Central Finnic group that must be attributed to later contact, due to the influence of literary North Estonian. Thus, contemporary \"Southern Finnic\" is a sprachbund that includes these languages, while diachronically they are not closely related.\n\nThe genetic classification of the Finnic dialects that can be extracted from Viitso (1998) is:\n\n\nViitso (2000) surveys 59 isoglosses separating the family into 58 dialect areas (finer division is possible), finding that an unambiguous perimeter can be set up only for South Estonian, Livonian, Votic, and Veps. In particular, no isogloss exactly coincides with the geographical division into 'Estonian' south of the Bay of Finland and 'Finnish' north of it. Despite this, standard Finnish and Estonian are not mutually intelligible.\n\nThe Southern Finnic languages consist of North and South Estonian (excluding the Coastal Estonian dialect group), Livonian and Votic (except the highly Ingrian-influenced Kukkuzi Votic). These languages are not closely related genetically, as noted above; it is a paraphyletic grouping, consisting of all Finnic languages except the Northern Finnic languages. The languages regardless share a number of features, such as the presence of a ninth vowel phoneme \"õ\", usually a close-mid back unrounded (but a close central unrounded in Livonian), as well as loss of \"*n\" before \"*s\" with compensatory lengthening.\n\n(North) Estonian-Votic has been suggested to possibly constitute an actual genetic subgroup (called varyingly Maa by Viitso (1998, 2000) or Central Finnic by Kallio (2014)), though the evidence is weak: almost all innovations shared by Estonian and Votic have also spread to South Estonian and/or Livonian. A possible defining innovation is the loss of \"*h\" after sonorants (\"*n, *l, *r\").\n\nThe Northern Finnic group has more evidence for being an actual historical/genetic subgroup. Phonetical innovations would include two changes in unstressed syllables: *ej > *ij, and *o > \"ö\" after front-harmonic vowels. The lack of \"õ\" in these languages as an innovation rather than a retention has been proposed, and recently resurrected. Germanic loanwords found throughout Northern Finnic but absent in Southern are also abundant, and even several Baltic examples of this are known.\n\nNorthern Finnic in turn divides into two main groups. The most Eastern Finnic group consists of the East Finnish dialects as well as Ingrian, Karelian and Veps; the proto-language of these was likely spoken in the vicinity of Lake Ladoga. The Western Finnic group consists of the West Finnish dialects, originally spoken on the western coast of Finland, and within which the oldest division is that into Southwestern, Tavastian and Southern Ostrobothnian dialects.

{"id": "2218879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218879", "title": "Toropets", "text": "Toropets\n\nToropets () is a town and the administrative center of Toropetsky District in Tver Oblast, Russia, located where the Toropa River enters Lake Solomennoye. Population: \n\nIn 1074, when the town was first mentioned in chronicles, Toropets belonged to the Princes of Smolensk. By 1167, it was large enough to have its own princes. The most famous of its rulers was Mstislav the Bold, whose grandson Alexander Nevsky wed Alexandra of Polotsk in Toropets in 1239.\n\nIn the mid-14th century the town passed to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which had to surrender it to Ivan III following the Battle of Vedrosha in 1503. In the early 17th century, Toropets was ransacked by the Polish army. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Toropets was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. Toropets was included into Velikiye Luki Province. In 1772, as a result of the First Partition of Poland, Inflanty Voivodeship and eastern Belarus were transferred to Russia. In order to accommodate these areas, Pskov Governorate was created, and Velikiye Luki was transferred to Pskov Governorate. The town of Opochka was made the administrative center of the governorate. Pskov Governorate has proven to be too big to be administered properly, and in 1776, the decree of the empress, Catherine the Great, was issued. It divided the governorate into Pskov and Polotsk Governorates. Pskov was made the administrative center of Pskov Governorate, and Toropets remained in Pskov Governorate. In 1777, Pskov Governorate was transformed into Pskov Viceroyalty, which was administered from Novgorod by Jacob Sievers. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished, and on 31 December 1796 the emperor Paul I issued a decree restoring Pskov Governorate. Toropets was the center of Toropetsky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate.\n\nThe Soviet authority in Toropets was established on October 30 (November 12), 1917. On August 1, 1927 Pskov Governorate was abolished, and Leningrad Oblast was established. Toropetsky Uyezd was abolished as well, and Toropetsky District, with the administrative center in Toropets, was established. It belonged to Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On June 17, 1929, the district was transferred to Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Toropetsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. The town was occupied by the Wehrmacht during WWII, from August 29, 1941 until January 21, 1942, when it was retaken during the Toropets–Kholm Offensive. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and Toropetssky District was transferred back to Kalinin Oblast. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Toropets serves as the administrative center of Toropetsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Toropetsky District as Toropets Urban Settlement. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Toropetsky Municipal District.\n\nThere are enterprises of chemical, metallurgical, textile, and food industries in Toropets.\n\nThe railway connecting Bologoye with Velikiye Luki passes through Toropets. There is infrequent passenger traffic.\n\nThe M9 highway connecting Moscow with Riga also crosses the southern part of Toropetsky District. Toropets has access to it via a paved road. The same road continues to the north to Kholm and further to Staraya Russa.\n\nToropets contains 66 cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally 30 objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments include plenty of buildings in the historical center of Toropets. The oldest brick churches in the town are dedicated to St. Nicholas (1666–1669), to Our Lady of Kazan (1698–1765), and to John the Baptist (1704).\n\nThere are a number of museums in Toropets, which include the Toropets District Museum, the Museum of the History of Photography, the house-museum of Patriarch Tikhon (Tikhon, in the future the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, lived here as a child for ten years).\n\nThe town is where Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow spent his childhood (between 1869 and 1878) and attended school .\n\n\n\n"}

When the roots are considered, however, Matsuzakaya has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in Ginza allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time. These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or rather displayed, luxurious products, which contributed to their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of the Japanese department store is from railway companies. There have been many private railway operators in the nation and, from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' termini. Seibu and Hankyu are the typical examples of this type.\n\nSince the 1980s Japanese department stores have been facing fierce competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, gradually losing their presence. Still, \"depāto\" are bastions of several aspects of cultural conservatism in the country. Gift certificates for prestigious department stores are frequently given as formal presents in Japan.\n\nDepartment stores in Japan generally offer a wide range of services and can include foreign exchange, travel reservations, ticket sales for local concerts and other events.\n\nDue to their roots, many Japanese department stores have sections devoted to kimono and Japanese traditional crafts, including pottery and lacquerware. The basement level usually has a grocery and food court, and on the roof may be garden and aquatic supplies, pets, and a children's play area.\n\nOperating hours are usually from 10am to 8pm. Some close one day a week, often a weekday.\n\nSome stores also have branches outside Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was hoped that the size of the prize and the potential speed of the participating boats would make it the most-exciting round-the-world race to date. Record prize money of $1 million was offered by Qatar Sports International which was headed by HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Heir Apparent of Qatar, which hoped to gain publicity as a tourism destination. The prize money however, along with the £6 million sponsorship was never paid by Qatar Sports International.\n\nOn 5 February four multihulled yachts began the route, off Doha.\n\nThe participants were:\n\n\n\"Geronimo\" was the first elimination on 2 March, as a result of hull damage following a collision with flotsam. de Kersauson returned to Australia to have the boat repaired, and to break the record for the circumnavigation of the continent in July. A week later the mast of \"Cheyenne\" broke just after the boat had rounded Cape Horn. With two remaining boats, \"Doha 2006\" won the race, finishing with an overall time of 62 days, 21 hours and 1 minute. The more-than-20-year-old \"Daedalus\" crossed the finishing line some 13 days later.\n\nMedia coverage in the Middle East, Far East and Asia (Qatar's key target markets) was valued at $46 million and the weekly race programmes made by APP were seen in 600 million homes, making it the most widely watched race in yachting history. The website including the children's 'Ali the Albatross' education pages received over 20 million hits. Tracy and her team also put together Qatar's first Sports Education Programme to which over 10,000 Qatari school children signed up.\n\nHSBC paid £3 million towards the event and Edwards personally borrowed £8 million to pay suppliers, her team and each of the competitors was paid between $1 million and $2 million each to enter (the first time a yacht race has managed to do this). However, Qatar Sports International reneged on the £6 million sponsorship deal and $1 million prize money and Edwards was consequently forced into bankruptcy and lost her home. She was discharged in September 2005. Edwards' legal team in Qatar won the first stage of her legal action in Qatar on 31 January 2006. Legal action to recover monies owed to Quest, its suppliers and Edwards herself is still ongoing.\n\nOrganiser Edwards was criticised by Bruno Peyron for splitting the field of potential participants by insisting on her own event, so that as a result Peyron was not able to recruit enough participants for his own event: a second edition of The Race. He won the 2005 Jules Verne Trophy instead, improving the record for circumnavigation which had previously been held by \"Cheyenne\".\n"}

These companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital funded companies, able to generate revenue and profit but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions, acquisitions or other investments. Because of this lack of scale, these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth, so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion, sales and marketing initiatives, equipment purchases, and new product development.\n\nGrowth capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a company's balance sheet, particularly to reduce the amount of leverage (or debt) the company has on its balance sheet.\n\nGrowth capital is often structured as preferred equity, although certain investors will use various hybrid securities that include a contractual return (i.e., interest payments) in addition to an ownership interest in the company. Often, companies that seek growth capital investments are not good candidates to borrow additional debt, either because of the stability of the company's earnings or because of its existing debt levels.\n\nGrowth capital resides at the intersection of private equity and venture capital and as such growth capital is provided by a variety of sources. The types of investors that provide growth capital to companies span a variety of both equity and debt sources, including private equity and late-stage venture capital funds, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, Business Development Companies (BDC), and mezzanine funds.

{"id": "2218913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218913", "title": "Michael Hussey", "text": "Michael Hussey\n\nMichael Edward Killeen Hussey (born 27 May 1975) also known as Mike Hussey is an Australian cricket coach, commentator and former international cricketer, who played all forms of the game. Hussey is also widely known by his nickname 'Mr Cricket'. Hussey was a relative latecomer to both the one-day international and Test Australian teams, debuting at 28 and 30 years of age in the respective formats, with 15,313 first-class runs before making his Test debut.\n\nHowever, he had a highly successful international career, being the top-ranked ODI batsman in the world in 2006. He played first-class cricket as vice-captain of the Western Warriors in Australia and played for three counties in England, as well as the Indian Premier League for the Chennai Super Kings. Michael Hussey announced his retirement from international cricket on 29 December 2012. He continued to play for Big Bash side Sydney Thunder after this date before announcing his retirement from all forms of cricket after the completion of BBL|05.\n\nHussey initially played for his native Western Australian Warriors, and his career total of 6471 runs ranks eighth in the list of that state's run-makers in the Sheffield Shield. He then moved to England, where in July 2001 he scored an unbeaten 329 (a Northamptonshire club record) at Wantage Road in his side's 633 for six declared on the way to a 10-wicket victory. He later captained Northamptonshire. In August 2003 he surpassed his own Northamptonshire record, when he scored 331 not out against Somerset at Taunton.\n\nWhen Hussey was playing for Australia A, the Australian reserve team, Allan Border once jokingly suggested he get match practice by staying in the nets for a full six hours; surprisingly, Hussey went on to do just that.\n\nHussey earned a Cricket Australia contract in 2004–05 after excelling in the ING Cup.\nStatistically, Hussey's international career was very successful, with his career batting average in Tests being 51.52 and in ODIs 48.15. He was a very occasional medium pace bowler, bowling only 98 overs in his Test career, 23 of them in 2008. He was brought into the attack usually to give the pace bowlers a rest, although he was once brought on in India to stop Ricky Ponting getting a one-match ban for a slow over rate. On 28 December 2008, Day 3 of the Boxing Day test, he got his first test wicket, Paul Harris caught by Mitchell Johnson. He ended with figures of 1/22. He took two wickets in One Day Internationals.\n\nHussey debuted for the Australian One-day team against India on 1 February 2004 at his home WACA ground in Perth. In this match Hussey made 17* helping Australia win the match by five wickets.\n\nIn the third Super Series match on 9 October 2005, Hussey became the first person to hit the roof of the Telstra Dome (the ICC World XI's Makhaya Ntini was the bowler in this case). On 6 February 2006, he tied with Adam Gilchrist, Andrew Symonds and Brett Lee on 22 votes for the Australian One-Day Player of the Year at the annual Allan Border Medal presentation. However, Symonds was ruled ineligible after an alcohol-related indiscretion, and after Lee and Gilchrist were eliminated on countback, Hussey was named the outright winner. Hussey had also come second overall in the Allan Border medal his first year in international cricket. On 3 November 2006, Hussey became the ICC's ODI Player of the Year at the annual ICC Awards in Mumbai. He was also named in its World ODI XI in 2006 and as 12th man in 2007.\nOn 18 September 2006, owing to Australia's rotation policy, and in Ricky Ponting's absence, Hussey captained Australia for the first time in the DLF Cup second round match against West Indies at Kuala Lumpur. Australia lost the game by three wickets, but Hussey and Brad Haddin put together a sixth-wicket partnership of 165, a world record for that wicket in all ODIs.\n\nIn the 2007 Commonwealth Bank Triangular Series, Australia were in trouble while chasing a target against England, and in a later match New Zealand. Both times Hussey guided the Australians to victory, and on both occasions was the only recognised batsman at the crease at the end of the match.\n\nHussey led Australia in the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy after selectors rested captain Ricky Ponting and vice-captain Adam Gilchrist. The first match against New Zealand saw a 10-wicket loss, the first time Australia had lost by this margin in their One Day International history, although Hussey top scored with 42 off 96 balls. Hussey's record as captain was further marred when Australia lost the top place in the ODI rankings to South Africa for the first time since they were introduced in 2002 after losing to New Zealand two days later. Hussey top-scored for Australia with an aggressive 105 off 84 before another loss in the final match left him with a captaincy record of four losses from four matches.\n\nIn early 2007, Hussey had a major slump in form with an average of only eight in over 10 innings, which scarcely improved in the World Cup where he gained an average of 17.4 with 87 runs. However, this was also due to a lack of opportunities to bat because of Australia's top-order dominance.\n\nIn the fourth ODI in the Commonwealth Bank Series played at the MCG on 10 February 2008 against India, Australia's top order and middle order collapsed, which saw Hussey come in at 5/72 with the side in deep trouble. He made a 53-run partnership for the seventh wicket with Brett Lee (which was the highest partnership of the innings) until Lee fell to Pathan. Hussey batted through the rest of the innings, making an unbeaten 65 off 88 being the only Australian to really contribute to the poor total of 159.\n\nIn the first ODI of the 2008 Bangladesh ODI series, Hussey top-scored with 85 and received the man-of-the-match award. This coincided with his rise to second in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI player rankings.\n\nAfter initially being left out, Michael Hussey was named in the Australian 2011 World Cup squad as the replacement of Doug Bollinger after recovering from hamstring injury that needed surgery.\n\nOn 19 February 2012, Michael Hussey became the 13th batsman to score 5000 runs for Australia in ODI cricket, when he scored 59 runs against India at the Gabba.\nHussey made his Test debut at the Gabba in Brisbane on 3 November 2005, as a replacement for fellow Western Australian batsman Justin Langer in the Australia vs. West Indies series. In the first innings Hussey managed only one run, caught by Denesh Ramdin off the bowling of Daren Powell. In the second innings Hussey turned in an unimpressive 29. In the following Test, at Bellerive Oval (Tasmania) he scored 137 and 31* and was named man of the match. In the third Test at Adelaide Oval, Hussey was moved down the order to number five to accommodate the return of Langer. He made 133 not out in the first innings and 30 not out in the second, bringing his Test average to 120.\n\nOn being moved down the order, Hussey proved invaluable to the Australian team, often building impressive partnerships with the tail-end batsmen, the most impressive being a 107-run 10th-wicket partnership with Glenn McGrath in the second Test in South Africa's 2005–06 tour of Australia. Hussey continued his remarkable batting with tail-enders against Bangladesh in their Spring 2006 2-Test series when he and Jason Gillespie (as a nightwatchman) put together a 320-run partnership, with Hussey making a then career-best 182.\n\nOn 18 April 2006 Hussey set a record as the fastest player in terms of time to reach 1,000 Test runs. He reached the milestone in just 166 days. Hussey was also the fastest player to reach the top 10 of the LG ICC cricket ratings. He maintained an exceptional average of 105.25 in the 2006–07 Ashes series, which Australia won 5–0.\n\nIn the second Test of the 2006–07 Ashes, Hussey made 91 before he was bowled (playing on) by Matthew Hoggard and fell nine runs short of his fifth Test century. In the second innings Australia was chasing 168 off 35 overs for victory for a chance to go 2–0 up in the series. After the fall of two early wickets, Ponting and Hussey, who was promoted to No. 4 instead of Damien Martyn, formed a steady partnership to guide Australia to victory. Ponting fell on 49 but the battle was well over. Hussey scored the winning runs and made 61 not out from 66 balls. His partner, Michael Clarke, scored 21 not out.\n\nOn 16 December Hussey scored 103 runs off 156 balls—his fifth Test century—on the third day of the third match of the series at the WACA Ground in Perth. On 6 January 2007 after Australia's 5–0 Ashes whitewash, Justin Langer anointed Hussey to be the next leader of the team's victory song Under the Southern Cross I Stand.\n\nIn the first Test of the Warne-Muralidaran Trophy against Sri Lanka, Hussey scored his sixth Test century with a score of 133 runs off 249 balls. He was also part of a record-breaking fourth-wicket partnership with Clarke. Their 245-run partnership is the third-highest partnership for Australia against Sri Lanka in Test matches. In the following match of the Warne-Muralitharan Trophy, Hussey scored his seventh Test century with a score of 132 and following it up in the second innings with 34 not out.\n\nOn 6 January 2008, at the SCG, Hussey scored his eighth Test century against India. This was the first time he scored more than 50 runs at that ground. He ended up not out on 145, before Ponting declared. However, in the first innings of the next Test he scored his first Test duck.\n\nHussey claimed his first Test wicket against South Africa on the third day of the 2008 Boxing Day Test at the MCG, when Paul Harris skied a ball over Mitchell Johnson's head and the latter ran back and took a running catch as the ball fell down past his shoulder.\n\nHussey played in all five of Ashes Test matches in England in 2009, scoring 276 runs in 8 innings. This gave him an average of 34.5. This included a century in Australia's second innings in the Fifth and final Test at The Oval where he scored 121, potentially saving his Test career after a long run without a century. He also scored two half centuries at Lord's in the Second Test, which England won, and in the Third Test at Edgbaston, which ended in a draw. He also took five catches in the field.\n\nIn the summer of 2009/10 Hussey scored his eleventh test century. Australia were playing Pakistan and were losing badly when Hussey proved yet again that he was brilliant with the tail end, scoring an unbeaten 134. This innings with Peter Siddle who scored 38 potentially saved the match as Australia went from a terrible position to a reasonable one and ended up winning the match with Michael Hussey named man of the match for his heroic effort.\n\nIn the first Test of the Frank Worrell Trophy against the West Indies in 2009 at the Gabba, Hussey took his second Test wicket after Dwayne Bravo hooked a short ball straight to deep backward square leg which was caught comfortably by Ben Hilfenhaus.\n\nPrior to the 2010/11 Ashes series, Hussey was experiencing poor form in the warm-up games and many were speculating that he should be dropped, but he was not. In the first test, he scored a magnificent 195, his highest test score, in a partnership of 307 with Brad Haddin, the highest partnership ever at the Gabba, later broken by Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott in the next innings; the test ended in a draw. In the second test, he scored 93 in the first innings following up with a 52 in the next. The next match, he helped Australia to a 267 run win scoring 61 and 116.\n\nIn the 2011 tour (3 test series) of Sri Lanka, he scored 95 & 15 in the first test which rewarded him with the Man of the Match honour. In the second test he made 142 and took two wickets, including a vital one in Kumar Sangakkara, and took a spectacular one-handed full length diving catch in the gully and also being rewarded with the Man of the Match honour. In the third test, he made 118 in the 1st innings.\n\nIn the first Test Match of 2012, Hussey scored an unbeaten 150* to help the Aussies to 659/4(dec). He was involved in a 344 run partnership with Michael Clarke, who managed to score an unbeaten 329*. He was praised for his efforts and he once again cemented himself in the team after being under some serious pressure from critics and selectors.\n\nHussey started the 2012/13 Australian summer well with a century against South Africa in the first test. A partnership with Michael Clarke proved to be vital, as the pair put on more than 200 runs during the fourth and fifth days. This feat was repeated in the 2nd test with another century, and a 272 run partnership with Clarke.\n\nHe played his final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, the last of Australia's three match series against Sri Lanka. In the first innings he was run out by Michael Clarke for 25, while in the second he guided Australia to victory with 27*.\n\nHussey was part of Australia's 2007 ICC World Twenty20 squad which was knocked out in the semi-finals. He played in all of Australia's matches, scoring 65 runs with a best of 37 before injuring a hamstring, which prevented his participation in Australia's tour of India that followed.\n\nIn May 2010, he scored 60 runs off 24 balls in the semi-final of the ICC World Twenty20 to help defeat Pakistan and secure a place for Australia in the final. It is considered to be one of the most stunning run chases in Twenty20 cricket.\n\nHussey played for the IPL team Chennai Super Kings, and he became the second batsman to score a century in the competition, after New Zealand's Brendon McCullum. He scored 116 not out against the team Kings XI Punjab.\n\nHussey chose to play for his Indian Premier League team Chennai Super Kings instead of his Australian state side Western Warriors in the inaugural Champions Twenty20 League although the 2008 event was eventually cancelled and neither side qualified in 2009.\n\nHussey due to national duties was unable to play the second edition of the Indian Premier League.\n\nHussey joined the Chennai Super Kings for the second half of the 2010 Indian Premier League along with teammate Doug Bollinger to reverse the fortunes of the side which eventually went on to win the title that year.\n\nIn the 2010 Champions League Twenty20, Michael Hussey replaced Matthew Hayden and opened the innings for the side along with Murali Vijay. He played a crucial knock in the group-clash against the Chevrolet Warriors which was a must-win game for the Chennai Super Kings. Hussey's innings fetched him the Man of the match award and helped the Chennai Super Kings to proceed to the knockout stage where they got to win the league altogether.\n\nIn IPL 2011 he was the fifth highest run getter in all IPL matches. He scored 492 runs from his fourteen innings with his highest score is 81 not out against the RCB. He has scored four half centuries and three man of the matches as well.\n\nIn January 2018, Chennai Super Kings appointed Michael Hussey as their batting coach.\n\nHussey scored 19 Test centuries and three ODI centuries.\n\nHussey is married to Amy and has four children. His father is a former athletics coach and his younger brother, David, is also a professional cricketer who plays for Victoria, Nottinghamshire, Chennai Super Kings and Australia. Prior to his entry into first-class cricket, Hussey studied to become a science teacher. He is also a fan of Manchester United due to his dad. Hussey attended Whitford Catholic Primary School in his early years and later attended Prendiville Catholic College in the northern suburbs of Perth. After finishing school he won a scholarship to the Australian Cricket Academy, where his contemporaries included Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie.\n\nHussey has the nickname \"Mr Cricket\", due to his encyclopaedic knowledge of his sport. He has repeatedly stated that he dislikes the nickname finding it \"a bit embarrassing\". England rival Andrew Flintoff and Graeme Swann's brother Alec were reportedly responsible for coining it. The sobriquet appeared on the back of his shirt in the Twenty20 international against South Africa in 2006, in which all the players displayed their nicknames. During the 2007 Twenty20 against England, however, he was seen with \"Huss\" on his shirt instead, further suggesting he is fed up with the tag Mr Cricket. Nevertheless, the nickname features prominently in his television ads for the national real estate chain LJ Hooker.\n\nHe announced his retirement from international cricket after the 2012 Boxing Day Test at Melbourne. His last Test appearance was the New Year’s fixture against Sri Lanka at the SCG, starting on 3 January 2013. He planned to play out the rest of the Australian summer in limited overs cricket but was surprisingly dropped with Australian selectors planning for the 2015 world cup and to give Phillip Hughes and Usman Khawaja an opportunity at ODI level. Hussey explained that his motivation for his retirement was to spend more time with his family. Hussey also delayed his announcement until before the Sydney Test in 2013, fearing that he would have been dropped before the Australian summer season was over.\n\nHussey also worked as a batting consultant for Australia for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the Big Bash League, Hussey was appointed the role of Director of Cricket for the Sydney Thunder. He was a cricket commentator in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the 2016 season. He was appointed as the Batting Coach of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for 2018 Season of Indian Premier League (IPL)\n"}

They are frequently used in people with chronic kidney failure (CKF), who are less able to excrete phosphate, resulting in an elevated serum phosphate.\n\nThese agents work by binding to phosphate in the GI tract, thereby making it unavailable to the body for absorption. Hence, these drugs are usually taken with meals to bind any phosphate that may be present in the ingested food. Phosphate binders may be simple molecular entities (such as magnesium, aluminium, calcium, or lanthanum salts) that react with phosphate and form an insoluble compound. Phosphate binders such as sevelamer may also be polymeric structures which bind to phosphate and are then excreted.\n\nFor people with chronic kidney failure, controlling serum phosphate is important because it is associated with bone pathology and regulated together with serum calcium by the parathyroid hormone (PTH).\n\nThey are also used in hypoparathyroidism which presents with hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia.\n\nWith regard to phosphate binders, aluminium-containing compounds (such as aluminium hydroxide) are the least preferred because prolonged aluminium intake can cause encephalopathy and osteomalacia. If calcium is already being used as a supplement, additional calcium used as a phosphate binder may cause hypercalcemia and tissue-damaging calcinosis. One may avoid these adverse effects by using phosphate binders that do not contain calcium or aluminium as active ingredients, such as lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer.\n\nThere have been limited trials comparing phosphate binders to placebo in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in people with chronic kidney disease. When compared with people receiving calcium-based binders, people taking sevelamer have a reduced all-cause mortality.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2218925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218925", "title": "Stellar engine", "text": "Stellar engine\n\nStellar engines are a class of hypothetical megastructures which use a star's radiation to create usable energy. The concept has been introduced by Badescu and Cathcart. Some variants use this energy to produce thrust, and thus accelerate a star, and anything orbiting it, in a given direction. The creation of such a system would make its builders a Type-II civilization on the Kardashev scale.\n\nThree classes of stellar engines have been defined.\n\nOne of the simplest examples of stellar engine is the Shkadov thruster (named after Dr. Leonid Shkadov who first proposed it), or a Class A stellar engine. Such an engine is a stellar propulsion system, consisting of an enormous mirror/light sail—actually a massive type of solar statite large enough to classify as a megastructure—which would balance gravitational attraction towards and radiation pressure away from the star. Since the radiation pressure of the star would now be \"asymmetrical\", i.e. more radiation is being emitted in one direction as compared to another, the 'excess' radiation pressure acts as net thrust, accelerating the star in the direction of the hovering statite. Such thrust and acceleration would be \"very\" slight, but such a system could be stable for millennia. Any planetary system attached to the star would be 'dragged' along by its parent star. For a star such as the Sun, with luminosity 3.85 × 10 W and mass 1.99 × 10 kg, the total thrust produced by reflecting half of the solar output would be 1.28 × 10 N. After a period of one million years this would yield an imparted speed of 20 m/s, with a displacement from the original position of 0.03 light-years. After one billion years, the speed would be 20 km/s and the displacement 34,000 light-years, a little over a third of the estimated width of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nA Class B stellar engine is a Dyson sphere—of whichever variant—built around the star, which uses the difference in temperature between the star and the interstellar medium to extract usable energy from the system, possibly using heat engines or photovoltaic cells. Unlike the Shkadov thruster, such a system is not propulsive.\n\nA Class C stellar engine, such as the Badescu-Cathcart engine, combines the two other classes, employing both the propulsive aspects of the Shkadov thruster, and the energy generating aspects of a Class B engine.\n\nA Dyson shell with an inner surface partly covered by a mirror would be one incarnation of such a system (although it suffers from the same stabilization problems as a non-propulsive shell), as would be a Dyson swarm with a large statite mirror (see image above). A Dyson bubble variant is already a Shkadov thruster (provided that the arrangement of statite components is asymmetrical); adding energy extraction capability to the components seems an almost trivial extension.\n\nAstronomer Matthew E. Caplan of Illinois State University has proposed a variant of the Dyson swarm of mirrors that uses concentrated stellar energy to excite certain regions of the outer surface of the star and create beams of solar wind for collection by a multi-Bussard ramjet assembly, producing directed plasma to stabilize its orbit, and jets of oxygen-14 to push the star. Using rudimentary calculations that assume maximum efficiency, Caplan estimates the Bussard engine would use 10 grams per second of solar material to produce a maximum acceleration of 10 m/s, yielding a velocity of 200 km/s after 5 million years, and a distance of 10 parsecs over 1 million years. While theoretically the Bussard engine would work for 100 million years given the mass loss rate of the Sun, Caplan deems 10 million years to be sufficient for a stellar collision avoidance. His proposal was commissioned by the educational YouTube channel Kurzgesagt.\n\nIn Olaf Stapledon's 1937 science fiction novel \"Star Maker\", some advanced galactic civilizations attempt to use stellar engines to propel their planetary systems across the galaxy in order to physically contact other advanced galactic civilizations. However, it turns out that the stars are life forms with a consciousness of their own, and their consciousnesses are extremely upset by this happening to them, because it violates the canon of the galactic ballet dance the stars feel they are a part of and which the stars feel is the primary focus and most sacred ritual of their lives. So, those stars whose surrounding civilizations attempt to force them to move in a different direction take revenge by committing suicide by exploding as supernovae, thus destroying their attendant worlds. This initiates the \"War of Stars and Worlds\", lasting millions of years, which becomes a pivotal event in the history of the galaxy. The war only ends when the galactic civilizations figure out how to telepathically communicate with the stars and arrange a truce.\n\nThe novel \" Manifold: Space\" by Stephen Baxter has a Shkadov thruster being built around a neutron star which is destined to collide with another neutron star; the intention is to delay the collision, so that Galactic civilization will not be wiped out.\n\nThe novel \"Bowl of Heaven\" by Larry Niven and Gregory Benford describes a bowl shaped megastructure that uses magnetic fields to cause its star to emit a plasma jet, which moves the star accompanied by the megastructure.\n\nThe film \"\" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has a series of scenes that take place at Nidavellir, a stellar engine used as a weapons forge.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2218927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218927", "title": "The Triffids", "text": "The Triffids\n\nThe Triffids were an Australian alternative rock and pop band, formed in Perth in Western Australia in May 1978 with David McComb as singer-songwriter, guitarist, bass guitarist and keyboardist. They achieved some success in Australia, but greater success in the UK and in Scandinavia in the 1980s before disbanding in 1989. Some of their best-known songs include \"Wide Open Road\" (February 1986) and \"Bury Me Deep in Love\" (October 1987). SBS television featured their 1986 album, \"Born Sandy Devotional\", on the \"Great Australian Albums\" series in 2007, and in 2010 it ranked 5th in the book \"The 100 Best Australian Albums\" by Toby Creswell, Craig Mathieson and John O'Donnell.\n\nThe Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) recognised The Triffids' importance on 1 July 2008 when inducting them into the Hall of Fame. Music historian Ian McFarlane declared,\n\"The Triffids remain one of Australia's best-loved, post-punk groups [...] McComb was an authoritative singer and accomplished songwriter [...] he infused his melancholy songs with stark yet beautiful and uniquely Australian imagery. Few songwriters managed to capture the feeling of isolation and fatalistic sense of despair of the Australian countryside.\"\n\nIn 1976 in Perth, high school students David McComb, on acoustic and bass guitars and vocals, and Alan \"Alsy\" MacDonald, on drums and vocals, formed Dalsy as a multimedia project, making music, books and photographs. They wrote and performed songs with Phil Kakulas on guitars and vocals (all three later in The Blackeyed Susans), then soon became Blök Musik and Logic (for a day). In May 1978, they became The Triffids, taking their name from the post-apocalyptic novel by John Wyndham, \"The Day of the Triffids\". They were soon joined by Andrew McGowan on guitar and Julian Douglas-Smith on piano. When Byron Sinclair joined on bass guitar in September, McComb switched to rhythm guitar. The Triffids began partly in response to the punk rock movement. Writing in his diary as a teenager, McComb traced the band's emergence in Perth:\n\n\"On the night of 27 November 1976, a tape was made by Alsy MacDonald, playing a single toy drum, and Dave McComb playing acoustic guitar. The multimedia group 'Dalsy' had come into being. Dalsy went on to make several remarkable tapes (mainly of original material): \"The Loft Tapes\", \"Rock 'n' Roll Accountancy\", \"Live at Ding Dongs\", \"Bored Kids\", \"Domestic Cosmos\", \"People Are Strange Dalsy Are Stranger\", \"Steve's\" and the seminal punk work, \"Pale Horse Have a Fit\" ... Dalsy did paintings, sculptures and poetry, and wrote a book named \"Lunch\". They were tinny and quirky, obsessive and manic, versatile and productive. They were also immensely unpopular ... The members of Dalsy grew to hate their audience. They still do, and this hate is an integral part of their music. Dalsy split up towards the end of 1977 ... They launched into 1978 as Blok Musik, with their famous \"Blok Musik\" tape ... In April, they played at the Leederville Town Hall Punk Fest, alongside Perth's punk rock contingent but, as usual, no one danced. After that they went home and metamorphosised into Logic. Within a day they changed their minds, and metamorphosised into the Triffids.\"\n\nBetween 1978 and 1981, McComb had written over 100 original songs and The Triffids had recorded and independently released six cassette tapes, simply called, \"1st\" (1978), \"2nd\" (1978), \"3rd\" (1979), \"4th\" (1979), \"Tape 5\" (1980) and \"Sixth\" (1981) (see List of The Triffids Cassettes). By 1979, Kakulas and Sinclair had left and were replaced by David's older brother, Robert McComb on violin and guitar, and Will Akers on bass guitar, and in 1980 Margaret Gillard joined on keyboards. At year's end, the band won a song competition run by the Western Australian Institute of Technology (now Curtin University) Student Guild's radio show on 6NR (now Curtin FM), and in July 1981 they released their first single, \"Stand Up\", on the Shake Some Action label. MacDonald had briefly left the band for two months, and the single was recorded with Mark Peters as drummer.\n\nGillard and Akers left in February 1982 and were replaced by Jill Yates on keyboards and a returning Sinclair. April saw the release of \"Reverie\", a four-track EP on Resonant Records. Around this time, due to the small population/market in Perth, the band started the long journey driving from Perth to Sydney, then Melbourne (and back again) to play shows, do some recording and to live for large periods of time, often in quite squalid conditions. By mid-year Sinclair had left again, and Martyn P. Casey joined the band on bass guitar in September 1982. For $150 a night, The Triffids' services as a support act were procured by The Reels, The Sunnyboys, The Church, Hunters & Collectors or Uncanny X-Men.\n\nAs a four-piece — Casey, David & Robert McComb, and MacDonald — they signed to Mushroom Records' White Label in Melbourne and released a single, \"Spanish Blue\", in October 1982 and the \"Bad Timing and Other Stories\" EP in March 1983. By then, back in Sydney again, Jill Birt had joined on piano, organ and vocals. Soon after the release of \"Bad Timing and Other Stories\", Mushroom Records let the band go. They signed with new Australian independent label Hot Records, which brought the independent scene some much needed cohesion. The Triffids were one of the bands leading Hot's drive into overseas markets, which partly led to the label's demise. The Triffids' debut album, \"Treeless Plain\", released in November 1983, was critically acclaimed  — described as a \"magnificent, muscular piece of work that pounds out simple powerful rock songs — one of the best indie rock albums of its day\" — but no singles were released from it. All tracks for \"Treeless Plain\" were recorded over twelve midnight-to-dawn sessions at Emerald City Studios, Sydney, in August and September 1983 with The Triffids producing. Their next single, \"Beautiful Waste\", appeared in February 1984 and was followed by the \"Raining Pleasure\" 12\" EP in July—the title track, \"Raining Pleasure\", featured Birt on lead vocals and was cowritten by David McComb with Sydney musician James Paterson (JFK & the Cuban Crisis). Another track, \"St. James Infirmary\", is a traditional blues folksong, with their version preferred by Australian rock music journalist Toby Creswell in his book, \"1001 Songs\".\n\nThe Triffids, without Birt, recorded \"Lawson Square Infirmary\" at the Sydney Opera House, where they worked with Paterson on vocals, guitar, mandolin, and piano; Graham Lee (John Kennedy's Love Gone Wrong and in Eric Bogle's backing band) on vocals, dobro and pedal steel guitar; and Daubney Carshott (a.k.a. Martyn Casey) on bass guitar. The six-track country music-style EP was issued by Hot Records in October under the band name, Lawson Square Infirmary. Lee recalled:\n\n\"I taught primary school, travelled and ended up in Sydney, where I met the Triffids and first sat behind a pedal steel (in that order actually) [...] I met Dave [McComb] through James Paterson, who played in a band in Sydney called JFK and the Cuban Crisis. My initial impressions of Dave were: slightly eccentric, driven, something of a perfectionist, very intelligent.\"\n\nBy mid-1984, The Triffids had spent so much time travelling the between Perth in the west and Sydney on the east coast of Australia — David McComb estimated that they made this trip between 12 and 16 times — that they decided to travel that little bit further and headed to Europe.\n\nIn late August 1984, the band relocated to London, where \"Treeless Plain\" and \"Raining Pleasure\" had been issued by Rough Trade Records to positive critical reception. With little savings and five return plane tickets due to expire by Christmas, they gave themselves three months to make inroads in the UK. For their London debut they supported Rough Trade labelmates The Monochrome Set. Success was confirmed when they graced the January 1985 cover of the influential UK magazine \"NME\", which predicted it would be 'The Year of The Triffids'.\n\nOn 6 November 1984, they recorded \"Field of Glass\", a three track 12\" EP, mostly live in BBC Studio 5 in London, which was issued in February 1985. The title track, \"Field of Glass\", was not released on CD as the master tape could not be found—it was eventually discovered under David McComb's bed. During the Australian tour in early 1985, the band acquired their final permanent member, Lee, who had performed on the mini-album \"Lawson Square Infirmary\". Together the six-piece—Birt, Casey, Lee, MacDonald, David & Robert McComb—recorded a 12\" EP \"You Don’t Miss Your Water\". The A-side is a countrified version of William Bell's \"You Don't Miss Your Water\", which was released in August by Hot Records, but by then they were already back in London.\n\nDuring 1985, The Triffids had toured Europe, they were feted by the European press and played from tiny clubs to stadiums supporting Echo & the Bunnymen. A grass roots following developed as they toured western European countries, finding pockets of popularity in the Netherlands, Greece, Scandinavia, Ireland and Belgium. The band toured as part of the Summer Eurofestival circuit, performing at Glastonbury, Pinkpop, Waterpop, Seinäjoki, Roskilde (40,000), T&W Belgium (35,000) and den Haag's Parkpop (pushing 100,000).\n\nUnable to raise a major record deal and with low finances, \"Born Sandy Devotional\" was recorded in London in August 1985 with Gil Norton producing (who has also worked with Echo & the Bunnymen), and was released in March 1986. According to Ian McFarlane, Australian rock music historian, \"[It] was full of some of the most lonely, spacious songs ever written, and it remains one of the best Australian albums of the 1980s.\" In 2007, the album was featured by SBS Television on the \"Great Australian Albums\" series. The band issued two versions of the \"Wide Open Road\" single—both a 7\" and a 12\" version. \"Born Sandy Devotional\" reached # 27 on the UK albums chart, and \"Wide Open Road\" peaked at No. 26 on the UK singles charts but only reached No. 64 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart.\n\nCreswell stated that \"Wide Open Road\" was \"an angry song that finds the cost of freedom is aloneness\" in his book, \"1001 Songs\". In May 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named it one of their Top 30 Australian songs of all time.\n\nTheir critical success in the UK boosted their profile back in Australia where they recorded \"In the Pines\" in early 1986, while awaiting the release of \"Born Sandy Devotional\", which eventuated in March. \"In The Pines\" was recorded at the McCombs' family property in Ravensthorpe, south east of Perth, in a shearing shed on basic eight-track equipment. It was issued in January 1987 and took The Triffids deeper into folk and country music, with a lo-fi sensibility reminiscent of Bob Dylan's \"Basement Tapes\". The band backed Scottish musician Bill Drummond for his 1986 solo album \"The Man\". The Triffids toured UK later in the year.\n\nFrom 26 December 1986 to 26 January 1987, The Triffids were on the bill of the Australian Made tour, which was the largest touring festival of Australian music talent attempted to that point. Jimmy Barnes and INXS headlined, and the rest of the line-up featured Mental As Anything, Divinyls, Models, The Saints, and I'm Talking. A concert film, \"Australian Made: The Movie\", was directed by Richard Lowenstein and released later that year. The lead singer of INXS, Michael Hutchence, had insisted on The Triffids being part of the bill. 1987 also saw the release of three tracks recorded for John Peel on 5 May 1985, \"The Peel Sessions\".\n\nThe Triffids were courted by several UK major record labels, based on the success of \"Born Sandy Devotional\", eventually signing a three-record contract with Island Records in the UK in November 1986. Between April and August 1987, the band worked again with Norton, to record \"Calenture\", their Island Records debut. The album, released in February 1988, saw them explore themes of insanity, deception and rootlessness—the title refers to a fever suffered by sailors during long hot voyages. The Triffids were nomadic, travelling back and forth from Australia to England to record the 'difficult' album—initial recordings with US producer Craig Leon were abandoned—and obviously related to the disoriented sailors. It provided the singles \"Bury Me Deep in Love\" in October 1987 and \"Trick of the Light\" in January 1988.\n\nAfter \"Born Sandy Devotional\", they graduated to the festival circuit and played alongside Iggy Pop, the Ramones, The Fall, Anthrax and Echo & the Bunnymen. By 1988, their fame was such that \"NME\" invited them to contribute a cover version of The Beatles' song \"Good Morning Good Morning\" to the tribute album, \"Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father\", alongside songs by Billy Bragg and Wet Wet Wet.\n\nThe Triffids wanted to record the next album in Australia, but after the \"Calenture\" experience Island wanted to keep the band nearby. \"The Black Swan\" was recorded between September and October 1988 in Somerset, UK, and produced and engineered by Stephen Street. It was well received by critics, but the commercial success was not overwhelming, which disappointed band members. That, together with being tired from the constant travelling and touring, led to The Triffids being dissolved. The group travelled to the US in 1989 for a pair of New York dates before taking a much-needed vacation – one which turned permanent:\n\nWe didn't know they were final performances. Dave wanted to do a solo album and we were due to get back together after that. Much to his chagrin his solo album took longer than expected and he kept writing songs that sounded like Triffids songs. Domesticity snuck up on most of us, poor health snuck up on Dave, a planned '94 reunion tour was put on hold, and the Triffids faded into the mist. – Graham Lee \n\nThe band's last Australian shows were towards the end of 1989, with the final at the Australian National University in Canberra on 14 August 1989. 1990 saw the release of the live album, \"Stockholm\", which completed their contractual obligations with Island.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the band, Alsy MacDonald, Jill Birt and Robert McComb took \"proper jobs\" as a lawyer (currently with the Equal Opportunity Commission), architect and teacher respectively, with MacDonald and Birt marrying (Robert McComb currently teaches at Melbourne High School). David McComb and Lee continued to be involved with The Blackeyed Susans, a group David McComb formed as a side band during an earlier Triffids' summer tour of Australia. Martyn Casey briefly joined the Blackeyed Susans and then became a permanent member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in April 1990.\n\nIn 1990, David McComb moved back to London with the aim of pursuing his solo career. Since sustaining crushed vertebrae in the UK in 1986 McComb had suffered chronic and severe back pain that plagued him till his death. In 1992, after no success, he returned to Australia to make some solo recordings for Mushroom Records (featuring both Casey and Lee), releasing just one solo album, \"Love of Will\", in 1994. He also worked with many other musicians on various projects, including assembling a band, the Red Ponies, to tour Europe. In June 1993 three former members of The Triffids: David McComb, Robert McComb and Lee; as well as Charlie Owen and Chris Wilson guested on Acuff's Rose's debut studio album, \"Never Comin' Down\". Another project, costar, was formed when David moved to Melbourne, but due to his ill health they only played sporadically around Melbourne, although recordings had begun and a single was ready for a limited release.\n\nFollowing the Red Ponies tour David McComb suffered substance abuse-related health problems, which ultimately resulted in him undergoing a heart transplant in 1996. Despite the exacerbation of his back problem from the transplant procedure he embarked on a university course and his prolific output of songs continued. He recorded\n7 demos at the studio of Julian Wu, a long time supporter with old friends Martin Casey, Mick Harvey, Warren Ellis, Kiernan Box and Stuart Solar on drums. Forming 'costar' with Graham Lee, Kiernan Box on piano, Stuart Soler on drums Will Akers on bass and Matt Habbin on Saxophone. Ill health limited live performances but writing, arranging and other literary projects continued at a furious pace. Following a car accident in Melbourne, he was admitted to St Vincent's hospital. Three days later he died at home, on 2 February 1999, a few days short of his 37th birthday.\n\nIn February 2000, after the State Coroner of Victoria published his findings, \"The West Australian\" newspaper wrote: \"[Coroner] Johnstone said McComb's mental and physical condition had deteriorated after his (car) accident but his death was due to heroin toxicity and mild acute rejection of his 1996 heart transplant.\"\n\nThe Triffids back catalogue began being reissued in 2006. Graham Lee has taken on the role of guardian of David McComb's musical legacy. The Domino label in the UK is handling the reissues in Europe, while Liberation Music deals with Australia and New Zealand. An extended version of fan favourite \"Born Sandy Devotional\" came first, with staggered release dates in Europe, Australasia and North America between June and July 2006. A joint release of \"In the Pines\" and \"Calenture\" followed in February 2007. \"In the Pines\" was given a full remix by Bruce Callaway, the original engineer, who had been looking after the master tapes for 20 years. The album was also extended with a number of tracks that were recorded during the sessions for \"In The Pines\" but held over for inclusion on \"Calenture\" because, in David McComb's words, \"we have to keep something good for later.\" (\"In The Pines\" was essentially a low-budget 'holiday' album, recorded while the band was still looking for a deal with one of the major labels.) \"Calenture\" was extended with B-sides from the same period, and with a second disc of demo recordings for the album. A re-release of the last Triffids album \"The Black Swan\" with an extra disc of rarities and demos have, so far, ended the reissue programme.\n\nIn 2010 the best-of album \"Come Ride With Me...

Wide Open Road – The Deluxe Edition\", contained nine discs of bonus material, including early demos, tracks previously available on cassette only and full-length live recordings.\n\nLater stages of the re-issue programme is said to include further rarities, extended liner notes, remastering, a DVD and a live album. There is, currently, a selection of free downloads available on the official site, overseen by Lee.\n\nDavid McComb was posthumously inducted into the WAM (West Australian Music Industry Association) Hall of Fame as a composer on 21 February 2006.\n\nIn June 2006, in conjunction with the re-issue of \"Born Sandy Devotional\", the band re-formed to play three live performances, two concerts in Hasselt, Belgium, and one in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with guest vocalists (including Mark Snarski (The Jackson Code) and Belgian Harald Vanherf (The Hoodoo Club / Wicona Airbag) replacing David McComb. A huge collection of band memorabilia was also displayed, along with the airing of a Triffids concert film and question-and-answer sessions with the band members. According to Lee the experience was, \"more than I could have hoped for – a true celebration of the music, and an intensity from band and audience that I’ve rarely felt.\"\nThe five remaining members of The Triffids gave a series of performances on 17–20 January 2008, as part of the 2008 Sydney Festival celebrating the music and the memory of David McComb. The band were joined on stage by a number of Australian musicians including Mark and Rob Snarski (The Blackeyed Susans), Toby Martin (Youth Group), Steve Kilbey (The Church), Mick Harvey (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds), Chris Abrahams (The Necks) and Melanie Oxley. Youth Group in fact opened these shows with 4 covers of Early Triffids classics and rarities in praise of band's earlier years. A feature-length documentary of these shows, \"It's Raining Pleasure\", was to be released in early 2009.\n\nIn May 2008, Liberation Music continued with the reissuing of The Triffids' back catalogue, with the release of \"The Black Swan\", which includes five songs which had previously been left off the album at the time of its initial release, together with an encore. The album had originally been envisaged by David McComb as a double album. The re-released album also included a bonus disc of demos and unreleased material. Also released was \"Treeless Plain\" which was re-mixed by the original sound engineer, Nick Mansbridge. The last of the re-releases was a collection of songs from various EPs, \"Raining Pleasure\", \"Lawson Square Infirmary\" and \"Field of Glass\", under the title \"Beautiful Waste and Other Songs (Mini-Masterpieces 1983–1985)\". The compilation album also includes the title song, \"Beautiful Waste\", together with \"Dear Miss Lonelyhearts\" and \"Native Bride\".\n\nThe Triffids repeated their 2008 Sydney performances, 'A Secret in the Shape of a Song', at the Melbourne Arts Centre on 29 January 2009 and at the Perth International Arts Festival on 20–22 February 2009. The shows included guest appearances by Mick Harvey (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds), Melanie Oxley, Mark and Rob Snarski (The Blackeyed Susans), Steve Kilbey (The Church), Alex Archer and Brendon Humphries (The Kill Devil Hills), Ricky Maymi (The Brian Jonestown Massacre), and Toby Martin (Youth Group) on stage with the remaining members of the band. After the Perth performances video artists VJzoo showed a selection of David McComb's personal photographs live on screen to a soundtrack compiled from his mixtape collection. 'The Triffids and Friends' is a loose collective of some of the aforementioned musicians with remaining Triffids members. Youth Group once again reprised their renditions of early Triffids songs at these shows. Performances by the band along with The Church and Ed Keupper were scheduled for late 2011 in Perth.\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed bands from Greece, Raining Pleasure, took their name from the song \"Raining Pleasure\" by The Triffids.\n\nMelbourne-based acoustic rock group The Paradise Motel are frequently likened to the work of The Triffids whose work they have covered.\n\nARIA announced in June 2008 that The Triffids would be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Upon the announcement Graham Lee commented that David McComb would find the accolade ironic, given that the band were hardly superstars in their home country, but would have appreciated the belated recognition. On 1 July 2008, The Triffids were inducted by Nick Cave into the ARIA Hall of Fame; former members of The Triffids were joined on-stage by Rob Snarski as vocalist for \"Red Pony\" and Steve Kilbey as vocalist for \"Wide Open Road\".\n\nIn 2009, Australian scholars Chris Coughran and Niall Lucy's rock biography on The Triffids, \"Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids,\" was published by Fremantle Press, and includes contributions by Mick Harvey, Nick Cave, John Kinsella, DBC Pierre and Judith Lucy.

{"id": "2218939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218939", "title": "Dove Campaign for Real Beauty", "text": "Dove Campaign for Real Beauty\n\nThe Dove Campaign for Real Beauty is a worldwide marketing campaign launched by Unilever in 2004 that includes advertisements, video, workshops, sleepover events and the publication of a book and the production of a play, aiming to build self confidence in women and young children. Dove's partners in the effort include such marketing and communications agencies as Ogilvy & Mather, Edelman Public Relations, and Harbinger Communications (in Canada) along with other specialized consultants. Part of the overall project was the \"Evolution\" campaign.\n\nIn 2004, Dove and Ogilvy & Mather organized a photography exhibit titled \"Beyond Compare: Women Photographers on Real Beauty.\" The show featured work from 67 female photographers and was the beginning of the conversation on beauty that would lead to the Real Beauty campaign. The Dove Real Beauty campaign was conceived in 2004 during a 3-year creative strategic research effort, conducted in partnership with three universities in four cities around the world, led by Joah Santos. The creative was conceived by Ogilvy & Mather Düsseldorf and London.\n\nThe research created a new consumer-centric vs product-centric advertising strategy, which Joah Santos named (iconic Point Of View) P.O.V. - Purpose | Objective | Vision. The new strategy led to all top 5 Campaigns of the Century, as rated by Advertising Age and increased sales from $2B to $4B in 3 years. The strategy discarded the brand essence ladder typically used by Unilever and called for a POV strategy \"To make women feel comfortable in the skin they are in, to create a world where beauty is a source of confidence and not anxiety.\" All campaigns for Dove Real Beauty need then to follow the POV set forth, each with their own insight. The initial campaign insight/tension was an indication that only 2% of women consider themselves beautiful. It was created by Ogilvy & Mather Düsseldorf and London. \nThe first stage of the campaign centered on a series of billboard advertisements, initially put up in Germany and United Kingdom, and later worldwide. The spots showcased photographs of regular women (in place of professional models), taken by noted portrait photographer Rankin. The ads invited passers-by to vote on whether a particular model was, for example, \"Fat or Fab\" or \"Wrinkled or Wonderful\", with the results of the votes dynamically updated and displayed on the billboard itself. Accompanying the billboard advertisements was the publication of the \"Dove Report\", a corporate study which Unilever intended to \"[create] a new definition of beauty [which] will free women from self-doubt and encourage them to embrace their real beauty.\"\n\nThe series received significant media coverage from talk shows, women's magazines, and mainstream news broadcasts and publications, generating media exposure which Unilever has estimated to be worth more than 30 times the paid-for media space. Following this success, the campaign expanded into other media, with a series of television spots (\"Flip Your Wigs\" and the \"Pro-Age\" series, among others) and print advertisements (\"Tested on Real Curves\"), culminating in the 2006 \"Little Girls\" global campaign, which featured regional versions of the same advertisement in both print and screen, for which Unilever purchased a 30-second spot in the commercial break during Super Bowl XL at an estimated cost of US$2.5M.\n\nIn 2006, Ogilvy & Mather were seeking to extend the campaign further, by creating one or more viral videos to host on the Campaign for Real Beauty website. The first of these, \"Daughters,\" was an interview-style piece intended to show how mothers and daughters related to issues surrounding the modern perception of beauty and the beauty industry. The film, \"Daughters\", touches upon the self-esteem issues found in many young girls today. Dove's Self-Esteem Fund supports their campaign by using statistics that demonstrate how young women and girls are more apt to have distorted views of beauty. It was during the production of \"Daughters\" that a series of short films entitled \"Beauty Crackdown\" was pitched to Unilever as an \"activation idea.\" The concept was one that art director Tim Piper, who proposed to create \"Evolution\" with the budget left over from \"Daughters\" (C$135,000), pushed. It was originally intended to get people to the Campaign for Real Beauty website to see \"Daughters\", and to participate in the workshops featured on the site. After \"Evolution\", Ogilvy produced \"Onslaught\" and \"Amy\". Onslaught is an emotional video about the harsh reality of young girls and the influence that the beauty industry can have on them.\n\nIn April 2013, a video titled \"Dove Real Beauty Sketches\" was released as part of the campaign, created by Hugo Veiga. It went viral attracting strong reactions from the public and media. In the video, several women describe themselves to a forensic sketch artist who cannot see his subjects. The same women are then described by strangers whom they met the previous day. The sketches are compared, with the stranger's image invariably being both more flattering and more accurate. The differences create strong reactions when shown to the women.\n\nIn October 2013, \"Free Being Me\", a collaboration between Dove and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts was launched, with the aim of increasing \"self-esteem and body confidence\" in girls.\n\nIn 2017, Dove and Ogilvy London created limited-edition versions of body wash bottles meant to look like different body shapes and sizes. Dove produced 6,800 bottles of the six different designs and sent them to 15 different countries.\n\nIndividual ads caused different reactions, some positive and some negative. \"Evolution\" won two Cannes Lions Grand Prix awards. Writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", Katy Young called \"Real Beauty Sketches\" \"[Dove's] most thought provoking film yet ... Moving, eye opening and in some ways saddening, this is one campaign that will make you think, and hopefully, feel more beautiful.\"\n\nThe campaign has been criticized on the grounds that Unilever also produces Fair and Lovely, a skin-lightening product marketed at dark-skinned women in several countries. It was also widely noted that Unilever brand Lynx's advertising campaign would seemingly contradict the sentiment of the Campaign for Real Beauty. Moreover, Unilever owns Axe hygiene products, which are marketed to men using overtly sexualized women, and Slim Fast diet bars. Writing for \"Forbes\", Will Burns called such criticism \"totally irrelevant\". He explained: \"No one thinks of Dove as a Unilever brand, for starters (nor should Dove) ... But more to the point, does Dove’s idea mean teen boys don’t still want to smell good for the ladies? Or that people who are overweight don’t want to lose a few pounds? These are different brands solving problems for completely different audiences.\" The criticism has also been justified from others that state their concerns that the images that Dove portrays in their ads are supposed to be unedited and \"real\"; however, there have been comments made stating they have been photoshopped to smooth the appearance of the women's skin, hide wrinkles and blemishes, fix stray hairs, etc. Photo retoucher Pascal Dangin, who works for Box Studios in New York, told \"The New Yorker\" he made edits to the photos, “Do you know how much retouching was on that?” he asked. “But it was great to do, a challenge, to keep everyone’s skin and faces showing the mileage but not looking unattractive.” The women who are targeted by these ads have mixed reviews as well. Some women were turned off that Dove was in essence telling them they knew the insecurities they felt and what all women felt. Social networking sites such as Facebook became an outlet for women to express their praise and criticism.\n\nThe campaign has been criticized positively and negatively by consumers, critiques, and other companies because of the way Dove has chosen to portray their messages for their audience. Writing for \"The New York Times\", Tanzina Vega produced the article \"“ Ad About Women’s Self-Image Creates a Sensation\"”. In this piece it portrayed how different people viewed the Dove Real Beauty Campaign in different ways. First, was “Brenda Fiala, a senior vice president for strategy at Blast Radius, a digital advertising agency. Fiala stated that Dove was trying to create a sense of trust with the consumer by tapping into deep-seated emotions that many women feel about themselves and their appearance”. What she also believed for The Dove Real Beauty Campaign was that the campaign “hits on a real human truth for women,” and that,“Many women undervalue themselves and also the way they look\". On the other hand in this same ad it states that some people criticized the Ad’s for the campaign believing they were contradicting with their true message. In the article by Vega; Jazz Brice, 24 a viewer of the campaign, explains during an interview how she took the messages from the Dove Real Beauty Campaign “I think it makes people much more susceptible to absorbing the subconscious messages, and that at the heart of it all is that beauty is still what defines women. It is a little hypocritical\". The campaign has had an impact worldwide in both positive and negative ways with the help of Dove’s social media outlets such as; Facebook and Twitter. The Dove Campaign was one of the first campaigns to be considered as going \"viral\" in the sense that to be viral was new and generally unknown at the time of the beginning of the campaign (2004). Some viewers received the message as a positive impact to the way women were viewed while other viewed it as the opposite.\n\nWith the positive and negative feedback received from the viewers and consumers of the campaign the Dove Company did not just want to “talk” to media about the problem they wanted to “act” on the issues and embrace the advantages of the campaign for the future. In the article, \"“Dove’ Real Beauty Campaign Turns 10: How a Brand Tried To Change The Conversation About Female Beauty”\", written by Nina Bahadur from the HuffPost interviewed a spokesperson for the Dove Company about the types of feed back they have got from the Dove Real Beauty Campaign and how it has impacted the company. Sharon MacLeod, vice president of Unilever North America Personal Care, told HuffPost\"[We were thinking], we have to walk the talk” she also stated “We can't just be getting people stirred up; awareness and conversation isn't enough. We actually have to do something to change what's happening.” Since the start of the campaign, Dove has started funds for women and girls to promote their message along with more advertisings in attempt to bring more awareness to women of different ages and cultural background. The company of Dove believes they still have a chance to bring a greater impact on society and the generations to come when it comes to the impact of societies views of beauty and the impact it has on women and young girls. As stated in the interview with MacLeod \"We're going to try to change a generation,\" MacLeod tells HuffPost”You have to wait until they grow up to see what happens.” Some critiques on the other hand believe that the campaign focuses to greatly on the physical aspect of beauty instead of other areas that should have more focus. From The Cut, Ann Friedman states the following about the Dove Real Beauty Campaign: “These ads still uphold the notion that, when it comes to evaluating ourselves and other women, beauty is paramount. The goal shouldn’t be to get women to focus on how we are all gorgeous in our own way. It should be to get women to do for ourselves what we wish the broader culture would do: judge each other based on intelligence and wit and ethical sensibility, not just our faces and bodies.” Critics and defenders of the Dove Real Beauty Campaign have both pointed out on occasion that because just cause Dove is trying to redefine what society and women believe as beauty does not essentially mean that women and younger girls will feel different about themselves, this is also stated by Ann Friedman when she suggests to the HuffPost as evidence that Dove's message about beauty is important and necessary. An estimated 80 percent of American women feel dissatisfied with their bodies, and 81 percent of 10-year-old girls are afraid of becoming \"fat.\" Can a series of ad campaigns really change institutionalized body hatred?\n"}
{"id": "2218940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218940", "title": "Quarterly Review", "text": "Quarterly Review\n\nThe Quarterly Review was a literary and political periodical founded in March 1809 by the well known London publishing house John Murray. It ceased publication in 1967.\n\nInitially, the \"Quarterly\" was set up primarily to counter the influence on public opinion of the \"Edinburgh Review\". Its first editor, William Gifford, was appointed by George Canning, at the time Foreign Secretary, later Prime Minister.\n\nEarly contributors included the Secretaries of the Admiralty John Wilson Croker and Sir John Barrow, the Poet Laureate Robert Southey, the poet-novelist Sir Walter Scott, the Italian exile Ugo Foscolo, the Gothic novelist Charles Robert Maturin, and the essayist Charles Lamb.\n\nUnder Gifford, the journal took the Canningite liberal-conservative position on matters of domestic and foreign policy, if only inconsistently. It opposed major political reforms, but it supported the gradual abolition of slavery, moderate law reform, humanitarian treatment of criminals and the insane, and the liberalizing of trade. In a series of brilliant articles in its pages, Southey advocated a progressive philosophy of social reform. Because two of his key writers, Scott and Southey, were opposed to Catholic emancipation, Gifford did not permit the journal to take a clear position on that issue.\n\nReflecting divisions in the Conservative party itself, under its third editor, John Gibson Lockhart, the \"Quarterly\" became less consistent in its political philosophy. While Croker continued to represent the Canningites and Peelites, the party's liberal wing, it also found a place for the more extremely conservative views of Lords Eldon and Wellington.\n\nDuring its early years, reviews of new works were sometimes remarkably long. That of Henry Koster's \"Travels in Brazil\" (1816) ran to forty-three pages.\n\nTypical of early nineteenth-century journals, reviewing in the \"Quarterly\" was highly politicized and on occasion excessively dismissive. Writers and publishers known for their Unitarian or radical views were among the early journal's main targets. Prominent victims of scathing reviews included the Irish novelist Lady Morgan (Sydney Owenson), the English poet and essayist Walter Savage Landor, the English novelist Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and her husband the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\nIn an 1817 article, John Wilson Croker attacked John Keats in a review of \"Endymion\" for his association with Leigh Hunt and the so-called Cockney School of poetry. Shelley blamed Croker's article for bringing about the death of the seriously ill poet, 'snuffed out', in Byron's ironic phrase, 'by an article'.\n\nIn 1816, Sir Walter Scott reviewed his own, but anonymously published, Tales of My Landlord, partly to deflect suspicion that he was the author; he proved one of the books's harshest critics. Scott was also the author of a favourable review of Jane Austen's \"Emma\".\n\n\n\n"}

Nurutdinov states that the original, written in \"Bulgar Turkic\" (here equated with the language of the Volga Tatars), in the Arabic script, was translated into Russian in the late 1930s by his uncle I.M.-K.-Nigmatullin, who did this in order to save it from an NKVD campaign of confiscation and destruction of old Bulgarian documents written in the Arabic script. The manuscript containing the Bulgarian text was destroyed by NKVD agents. Nigmatullin himself was killed in World War II, and the translation was preserved by his mother, who eventually passed it over to her grandson, Nurutdinov, in 1976. He managed to copy parts of the translation, but the original translation and some of the copies were stolen from his father's country house in the 1980s by unknown perpetrators. Finally, Nurutdinov published the remaining text.\n\nThe text refers to numerous persons and historical events unattested in other sources; for example, it makes references to mid 7th century Khazar rulers named Khalga and Kaban, who do not appear in the account of al-Tabari, in the Schechter Letter, in the Khazar Correspondence, or any other extant document. It also associates the Bulgarians with what Nurutdinov interprets as references to Troy, Sumer and America.\n\nSome scholars view the work as a mixture of (previously known) factual data and outright fabrications, while others view the work as authentic.\n\n\n"}

Ennis and Gort are two major towns on the route, and Shannon Airport is reached via the connecting N19. The west coast route continues on to Sligo as the N17. The section from Limerick to the N19 junction forms part of European route E20, and the entire route is part of the proposed Atlantic Corridor. The section of motorway from Shannon to Claregalway is designated the M18 motorway. The tolled Limerick Tunnel forms part of the route.\n\nAs of 27 July 2010, the N18 commences at the Rosbrien interchange, a major interchange south of Limerick city, where it joins the M7 motorway to Dublin and M20 motorway towards Cork and Tralee. The dual carriageway continues north, intersecting with the N69 road, before crossing under the River Shannon using the Limerick Tunnel, this section of the route forms phase II of the Limerick Southern Ring Road. North of the River Shannon the N18 continues as dual-carriageway bypassing Cratloe, Sixmilebridge and Bunratty. The road passed alongside Bunratty Castle before the completion of the neighbouring dual-carriageway section in the late 1980s/early 1990s. The other nearby junctions were also converted to fly-overs in the 1990s.\n\nThe road continues north with junctions at Hurler's Cross and Shannon Town, there is a fly-over connecting Shannon Airport via the N19 dual-carriageway.\n\nThe N18 continues north of the N19 junction where motorway regulations are enforced and the N18 route is designated as the M18 bypassing the towns of Newmarket-on-Fergus, Ennis and Gort. The motorway currently ends at Gort where the route continues as a single carriageway through County Galway. The dual-carriageway between Shannon and Ennis (including the Ennis bypass) was included in the second tranche of motorway redesignations and gained motorway status on the 28th of August 2009.\n\nThe Gort to Tuam (M18/M17) scheme consists of of motorway and of Type 2 dual-carriageway. DirectRoute (Tuam) Ltd., a consortium consisting of Marguerite Fund, InfraRed Capital Partners, Sisk Group, Lagan Construction Group, Roadbridge and Strabag began construction of the scheme in 2015 and was officially opened on 27 September 2017.\n\nIt completed the existing M18 motorway, bypassing the towns of Kilcolgan and Oranmore. The route then continues north to the M6 Dublin–Galway motorway, forming interchange junction 19 on the M6. It then continues northwards bypassing Claregalway. The M18 had terminated at a temporary junction near Gort. In addition, a new section of the N17 was constructed as motorway. This motorway begins at a new junction with the M6 near Athenry, and ends with a dual-carriageway bypass of Tuam, which was also constructed as part of the scheme but was not designated a motorway. The N17 then continues into County Mayo towards Sligo.\n\nMajor improvements to the N18 route have been made over the past decade. Originally the route was a narrow single carriageway route that ran through all the main towns and villages between Limerick and Claregalway where the route terminates. The first improvements involved the dualling of the Limerick, Bunratty and Shannon route. The Newmarket on Fergus bypass opened in December 2002 and the Ennis bypass opened in 2007. Both were redesignated as motorway in August 2009. The Limerick Tunnel and phase II of the Limerick Southern Ring Road opened in July 2010 forming a continuous motorway dual-carriageway from the N/M18 to the M7 and M20 outside Limerick. On 12 November 2010 the €207 million Gort to Crusheen(M18) bypass was opened.

Construction was funded by landowner William Ellis, and Dublin Corporation. It was named after Richard, Earl of Arran, second son of the Duke of Ormonde. From a drawing made by Francis Place in 1699, it appears to have been a four-span stone arched bridge.\n\nIt was also known as \"Bridewell Bridge\" due to its proximity to the Smithfield Bridewell, and as \"Ellis's Bridge\" because of its association with Sir William and Sir John Ellis.\n\nThis structure stood for 80 years, but was swept away by a flood in 1763. The collapse was described by George Semple as being an unlucky accident when a raft of timber was swiftly carried downstream in a flood where it got lodged across the middle arch. The water flow increased under the raft at this point, and since the piers of the bridge were built on top of the river bed - \"This raft of timber obstructing the current of the surface, in like manner increased the power of it at the bottom and within the space of a few hours totally demolished the bridge\".\n\nDesigned by Charles Valency (a military engineer) a replacement bridge on the same site was built between 1764 and 1768 as a three elliptical arch stone bridge with a total span of 42 m, and named \"Queens Bridge\" after Charlotte of Mecklenburg, queen consort of George III.\n\nThe bridge was renamed for the legendary Queen Maeve at a meeting of the Municipal Council on 2 January 1922. However, it was renamed again in 1942 to its current name, after Lieutenant General Liam Mellows Irish Republican army who was executed during the Irish Civil War.\n\nBeing 250 years old, Mellow's Bridge remains the oldest of all Dublin city bridges still in use, although the parapets were replaced with cast iron balustrades and stone copings between 1816 and 1818.\n\nAs with other bridges on the Liffey in Dublin, and chiefly due to the many name changes, Mellow's Bridge is known locally by several names, including: \"Queen's Bridge\", \"Queen's Street Bridge\", \"Queen Maeve Bridge\", and \"Mellowes Bridge\" (with an \"e\").\n"}

This is usually not a safe assumption, so solutions need to be efficient using only limited network information.\n\nGiven the complexity of RWA, there are two general methodologies for solving the problem:\n\nFixed path routing is the simplest approach to finding a lightpath. The same fixed route for a given source and destination pair is always used. Typically this path is computed ahead of time using a shortest path algorithm, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm. While this approach is very simple, the performance is usually not sufficient. If resources along the fixed path are in use, future connection requests will be blocked even though other paths may exist.\n\nThe SP-1 (Shortest Path, 1 Probe) algorithm is an example of a Fixed Path Routing solution. This algorithm calculates the shortest path using the number of optical routers as the cost function. A single probe is used to establish the connection using the shortest path. The running time is the cost of Dijkstra's algorithm: formula_16, where formula_17 is the number of edges and formula_15 is the number of routers. The running time is just a constant if a predetermined path is used.\n\nThis definition of SP-1 uses the hop count as the cost function. The SP-1 algorithm could be extended to use different cost functions, such as the number of EDFAs.\n\nFixed alternate routing is an extension of fixed path routing. Instead of having just one fixed route for a given source and destination pair, several routes are stored. The probes can be sent in a serial or parallel fashion. For each connection request, the source node attempts to find a connection on each of the paths. If all of the paths fail, then the connection is blocked. If multiple paths are available, only one of them would be utilized.\n\nThe SP-formula_19 (Shortest Path, formula_19 Probes, formula_21) algorithm is an example of Fixed Alternate Routing. This algorithm calculates the formula_19 shortest paths using the number of optical routers as the cost function. The running time using Yen's algorithm is formula_23 where formula_17 is the number of edges, formula_15 is the number of routers, and formula_19 is the number of paths. The running time is a constant factor if the paths are precomputed.\n\nThe major issue with both fixed path routing and fixed alternate routing is that neither algorithm takes into account the current state of the network. If the predetermined paths are not available, the connection request will become blocked even though other paths may exist. Fixed Path Routing and Fixed Alternate Routing are both not quality aware. For these reasons, most of the research in RWA is currently taking place in Adaptive algorithms. Five examples of Adaptive Routing are LORA, PABR, IA-BF, IA-FF, and AQoS.\n\nAdaptive algorithms fall into two categories: traditional and physically aware. Traditional adaptive algorithms do not consider signal quality, however, physically aware adaptive algorithms do.\n\nThe lexicographical routing algorithm (LORA) algorithm was proposed in. The main idea behind LORA is to route connection requests away from congested areas of the network, increasing the probability that connection requests will be accepted. This is accomplished by setting the cost of each link to be formula_27 where formula_28 is parameter that can be dynamically adjusted according to the traffic load and formula_29 is the number of wavelengths in use on link formula_30. A standard shortest path algorithm can then be used to find the path. This requires each optical switch to broadcast recent usage information periodically. Note that LORA does not consider any physical impairments.\n\nWhen formula_28 is equal to one, the LORA algorithm is identical to the SP algorithm. Increasing the value of formula_28 will increase the bias towards less used routes. The optimal value of formula_28 can be calculated using the well-known hill climbing algorithm. The optimal values of formula_28 were between 1.1 and 1.2 in the proposal.\n\nThe physically aware backward reservation algorithm (PABR) is an extension of LORA. PABR is able to improve performance in two ways: considering physical impairments and improved wavelength selection. As PABR is searching for an optical path, paths with an unacceptable signal quality due to linear impairments are pruned. In other words, PABR is LORA with an additional quality constraint.\n\nNote that PABR can only consider linear impairments. The nonlinear impairments, on the other hand, would not be possible to estimate in a distributed environment due to their requirement of global traffic knowledge.\n\nPABR also considers signal quality when making the wavelength selection. It accomplishes this by removing from consideration all wavelengths with an unacceptable signal quality level. The approach is called Quality First Fit and it is discussed in the following section.\n\nBoth LORA and PABR can be implemented with either single-probing or multi-probing. The maximum number of probes formula_19 is denoted as LORA-formula_19 or PABR-formula_19. With single-probing, only one path is selected by the route selection. With multi-probing, multiple paths are attempted in parallel, increasing the probability of connection success.\n\nIA-BF - The Impairment Aware Best Fit (IA-BF) algorithm was proposed in. This algorithm is a distributed approach that is dependent upon a large amount of communication to use global information to always pick the shortest available path and wavelength. This is accomplished through the use of serial multi-probing. The shortest available path and wavelength are attempted first, and upon failure, the second shortest available path and wavelength are attempted. This process continues until a successful path and wavelength have been found or all wavelengths have been attempted.\n\nThe multi-probing approach will allow IA-BF to outperform both PABR-1 and LORA-1. However, as the number of probes increases, the performance of the algorithms is similar.\n\nIA-FF - Impairment Aware First Fit (IA-FF) is a simple extension of IA-BF. Instead of picking the wavelengths in terms of the minimum cost, the wavelengths are selected in order according to their index. IA-BF tends to outperform IA-FF under most scenarios.\n\nAQoS - Adaptive Quality of Service (AQoS) was proposed in. This algorithm is unique in a couple of ways. First, each node maintains two counters: formula_38 and formula_39. The purpose of each counter is to determine which issue is a bigger factor in blocking: Path and wavelength availability or Quality requirements. The algorithm chooses routes differently based upon the larger issue.\n\nAnother distinction is that AQoS uses the Q-factor as the link cost. The cost of the formula_40 link is calculated by this formula formula_41 where formula_42 is the number of lightpaths on the formula_40 link, formula_44 and formula_45 are the quality factor measurements of the formula_46 lightpath at the source and destination nodes of the formula_40 link, respectively. The repeated quality factor estimations are computationally very expensive.\n\nThis algorithm is single probing approach. The multi-probing approach, which the paper names ALT-AQoS (alternate AQoS) is a simple extension upon the same basic idea.\n\nTwo of the most common methods for wavelength assignment are First Fit and Random Fit. First Fit chooses the available wavelength with the lowest index. Random Fit determines which wavelengths are available and then chooses randomly amongst them. The complexity of both algorithms is formula_48, where formula_49 is the number of wavelengths. First Fit outperforms Random Fit.\n\nAn extension to First Fit and Random Fit was proposed in to consider signal quality. Quality First Fit and Quality Random Fit eliminate from consideration wavelengths which have an unacceptable signal quality. The complexity of these algorithms is higher though, as up to formula_49 calls to estimate the Q-factor are required.\n\nThere are several other wavelength assignment algorithms: Least Used, Most Used, Min Product, Least Loaded, Max Sum, and Relative Capacity Loss. Most Used outperforms Least Used use significantly, and slightly outperforms First Fit. Min Product, Least Loaded, Max Sum, and Relative Capacity Loss all try to choose a wavelength that minimizes the probability that future requests will be blocked.\n\nA significant disadvantage of these algorithms is that they require a significant communication overhead, making them unpractical to implement unless you have a centralized network structure.\n\nAn alternate approach to selecting a route and wavelength separately is to consider them jointly. These approaches tend to more theoretical and not very practical. As this is a NP-complete problem, any exact solution is likely not be possible. The approximation techniques usually aren't very useful either, as they will require centralized control and, usually, predefined traffic demands. Two joint approaches are ILP formulation and Island Hopping.\n\nThe ILP formulation listed above can be solved using a traditional ILP solver. This is typically done by temporarily relaxing the integer constraints, solving the problem optimally, and converting the real solution to an integer solution. Additional constraints can be added and the process repeated indefinitely using a branch and bound approach.\n\nIn the authors report on the algorithm which can be used to solve efficiently and optimally a constrained RWA problem. The authors study a constrained routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) problem, which can be reduced to a constrained RWA problem by requesting one slice. The constriction limits the path length.\n\nIn the authors report on the generalized Dijkstra algorithm, which can be used to efficiently and optimally solve the RWA, RSA, and the routing, modulation, and spectrum assignment (RMSA) problems, without the limit on the path length.\n"}

As its name suggests, is adjacent to the Victoria Tower, the south-western corner of the Palace of Westminster. The park, which extends southwards from the Palace to Lambeth Bridge, sandwiched between Millbank and the river, also forms part of the Thames Embankment.\n\nVictoria Tower Gardens is a Grade II* listed park created in 1864–1870, following the embankment of the Thames. It is in a Conservation Area, is partly within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Westminster, and is designated a zone of Monument Saturation.\n\nThe Gardens were created during the 1870s by Joseph Bazalgette, and was part of a project for the Metropolitan Board of Works to provide London with a modern sewerage system.\n\nThe gardens were later expanded. This expansion was discussed in parliament in 1898 in the 'Victoria Embankment extension and St John's improvement bill'. A number of wharves were compulsorily purchased, including Dorset Wharf (shown on 1885 map) which was purchased from George Taverner Miller, son of Taverner John Miller, from where he ran a \"\"Sperm Oil Merchants and Spermaceti refining\"\" business. The effects from this business and others were sold in 1905.\n\nThe park features:\n\nIn January 2015 David Cameron announced on behalf of the Holocaust Memorial Foundation that there was to be a new UK Holocaust Memorial and associated Learning Centre built in central London. At that stage three particular sites were proposed: the Imperial War Museum, Potter's Field near London City Hall, and on Millbank, south of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. However, in July 2016 it was announced that Victoria Tower Gardens had been chosen for both the memorial and underground learning centre. A design competition was launched, and in October 2017 the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation jury announced their chosen design. The proposed construction will be submitted for planning permission to Westminster City Council who will have to consider breaching their own rules on new monuments in this zone and the effect on heritage views of the Palace of Westminster. The memorial plans attracted strong opposition to the use of this small park, both from the grassroots campaign of local residents through the 'Save Victoria Tower Gardens' and international organisations like the UNESCO advisor ICOMOS. \n\nThe nearest London Underground stations are Westminster and Pimlico.\n\n"}

Hamilcar, grandson of Hanno the Great, led the Carthaginians, while the Syracusans were led by Agathocles. Agathocles initially surprised the Carthaginians with an attack on their camp, but the Greeks lost the battle when they were attacked by unexpected Carthaginian reinforcements. The Greek army took many casualties as it retreated. Agathocles managed to gather the remains of his army and retreat to Syracuse, but lost control of Sicily.\n\nIn classical antiquity the name Himera was used for two rivers on Sicily: the Imera Settentrionale and the Salso. The Imera Settentrionale flows north towards its mouth at the site of ancient Himera, the Salso follows a southern course to its mouth in modern Licata. The battle took place near the mouth of the Salso river because the Carthaginians positioned themselves on the hill of Ecnomus during the battle. This hill lies west of Licata.\n\nAfter Agathocles was exiled for an attempt to usurp power in his own city Syracuse, he was received by Morgantina, an enemy of Syracuse. As their general-in-chief he conducted a war for them, took Leontini and besieged Syracuse. The Syracusans turned to their enemy Carthage for help and were given reinforcements under the command of the Carthaginian general Hamilcar. Agathocles realized he could not take Syracuse, so he decided to make an alliance with Hamilcar instead. Hamilcar agreed, out of fear of the power of Agathocles, but also because he was promised favors to increase his power in Carthage.\n\nThe specific terms of the treaty stipulated that the Sicilian Greek towns Heraclea Minoa, Selinunte and Himera were to be controlled by Carthage as had previously been the case, and all the others were to be autonomous under the hegemony of Syracuse. The treaty also included an end to the war of Acragas, Gela and Messene with Agathocles. Hamilcar turned over Syracuse to Agathocles and left him with five thousand African troops. Agathocles then massacred the senate and the richest common people of the city and made himself tyrant.\n\nAgathocles then proceeded to raise an army and broke the treaty. He attacked the neighbouring cities of Syracuse and the Sicilian cities allied with Carthage, but Hamilcar did not act against him. These cities complained to the senate of Carthage. The senate was not able to do much about it because Hamilcar was in command of the army. They decided to delay punishing Hamilcar until another Hamilcar, the son of Gisco, returned from Sicily. Hamilcar died before this could happen, and upon his return the other Hamilcar was sent to Sicily with an army.\n\nHamilcar was sent to Sicily with 130 triremes, 2,000 citizen soldiers, 10,000 Libyans, 1,000 mercenaries, 200 Etruscans, and 1,000 Balearic slingers. After the army's departure from Carthage, sixty triremes and two hundred supply ships were lost in a storm. Some of the citizens soldiers, of which many were nobles, died in the storm. Once on Sicily, Hamilcar managed to reinforce his army with more mercenaries and troops of the Sicilian allies, as well as the Carthaginian troops already present there. At this point his force numbered about 40,000 infantry and nearly 5,000 cavalry.\n\nAgathocles recognized that the Carthaginian army was superior to his own and feared that several of the cities under his control would desert him for Carthage. In particular he was concerned for Gela because the Carthaginian army was positioned in its territory. At the same time he suffered a considerable loss of twenty ships, which had been captured by the Carthaginians. Even so, he gave priority to keeping Gela under his control. He did not send in a garrison straight away because he feared the Geloans would shut him out, but sent in his troops a few at a time to trick them. When his troops eventually surpassed those of the Geloans, he took over the city and ordered four thousand Geloans to be slain. He confiscated their property and commanded the other inhabitants to turn over their money, gold and silver. He left the city with a garrison and then marched towards the Carthaginians.\n\nThe Carthaginians occupied the hill Ecnomus, which was said to have been a stronghold of Phalaris, a tyrant of Acragas. The hill acquired its name, which literally means 'lawless', because Phalaris had reputedly tortured people there in his brazen bull. On the other side Agathocles occupied another stronghold which had belonged to Phalaris, the Phalarium. Between the strongholds ran the Himera river, which both sides used as a defense against each other.\n\nFor a long time both sides did not risk crossing the river in force. Diodorus attributes this to sayings from earlier times which foretold that a great number of men were destined to die in battle at this place. Both sides engaged in raiding their enemy's territory and camp. When Greeks were driving away beasts of burden from the enemy camp, Carthaginian troops pursued them. Agathocles set up an ambush for the pursuers near the river, who were easily driven back when they tried to cross the river.\n\nAgathocles exploited this opportunity to start the battle. He ordered his whole army to cross the river and attacked the enemy camp. The Greeks threw down the palisade and took the Carthaginians by surprise. They had no opportunity to form a line of battle and fought fiercely for the moat, but the Greeks won the contest.\n\nTo counter the attack Hamilcar ordered his elite Balearic slingers to unleash a hail of stones on the attackers. Many Greeks were wounded or killed and driven away from the camp. Agathocles continued to attack the camp at other points and was close to taking the camp. The Greeks were then attacked by unexpected reinforcements from Libya which arrived by ship. The battle reversed itself and the Greeks fled to the Himera river or their camp.\n\nThe Greeks withdrew over a distance of forty stades, about , while being pursued by the Carthaginian cavalry. Because the pursuit took place during the middle of the day most of the fleeing Greeks became thirsty due to the heat and drank the water from the Himera river. Because the Himera river is naturally salty (which is reflected by its modern name \"Salso\") many Greeks died from drinking its water. According to Diodorus the number of casualties caused by the river were roughly equal to the number of Greeks killed in the pursuit. He states that in the whole battle 500 Carthaginians and 7,000 Greeks fell. Agathocles had managed to survive and collected those who had survived the rout. He burned his camp and withdrew into Gela.\n\nAgathocles decided to remain in Gela for some time to divert the Carthaginian army from Syracuse. This allowed the Syracusans to harvest their crops. Hamilcar first tried to besiege the city, but gave up when he discovered that Agathocles had large supplies and enough soldiers to defend the city. He then visited the cities and strongholds which were still siding with Agathocles to win them over. Because they despised Agathocles they soon deserted to the Carthaginians. Agathocles retreated to Syracuse and lost control over the rest of Sicily, while Carthage had gained superiority in land and naval forces. Agathocles supplied Syracuse with grain, left it with an adequate garrison and then crossed over to Libya to transfer the war to Africa.\n"}

He was educated at the Clara School and Stockholms lyceum and in 1860 became a student at the University of Uppsala. He was trained for diplomacy, which he quit for work at the Swedish Foreign Ministry. As early as 1861, under the pseudonym of Sven Tröst, he began to print poems, and he soon became the center of the brilliant literary society of the capital. In 1862 he published a collection of lyrics called \"Orchideer\" (\"Orchids\"). During 1864 and 1865 he was in Madrid and Paris on diplomatic missions. It was in 1869, when he first collected his \"Dikter\" under his own name, that Snoilsky took rank among the most eminent contemporary poets. His \"Sonnetter\" in 1871 increased his reputation. Then, for some years, Snoilsky abandoned poetry, and devoted himself to the work of the Foreign Office and to the study of numismatics.\n\nIn 1876, however, he published a translation of the ballads of Goethe. Snoilsky had in 1876 been appointed keeper of the records (\"expeditionssekreterare\") and head of the Foreign Ministry`s political department, in 1878 he was raised to chancery councillor ( \"swedish: kansliråd\" ), and succeeded Bishop Paul Genberg as one of the eighteen of the Swedish Academy. But in 1879 he resigned all his posts, and left Sweden abruptly for Florence with the Dowager Countess Ebba Piper, \"née\" Baroness Ruuth, whom he married in 1880. Count Snoilsky sent home in 1881 a volume of \"Nya Dikter\" (\"New Poems\"). Two other volumes of \"Dikter\" appeared in 1883 and 1887, and 1897; \"Savonarola\", a poem, in 1883, and \"Hvita frun\" (\"The White Lady\") in 1885. In 1886, he collected his poems dealing with national subjects as \"Svenska bilder\" (2nd ed., 1895), which ranks as a Swedish classic. In 1891 he returned to Stockholm and was appointed principal librarian (\"överbibliotekarie\") of the Royal Library. He died at Stockholm on May 19, 1903. His \"Samlade dikter\" were collected (Stockholm, 5 vols.) in 1903–1904.\n\nHis literary influence in Sweden was very great; he always sang of joy and liberty and beauty, and in his lyrics, more than in most modern verse, the ecstasy of youth finds expression. He is remarkable, also, for the extreme delicacy and melodiousness of his verse-forms.\n"}

A trip to Naples in the company of Jacques-Louis David sparked his interest in Greek and Roman architecture.\n\nHe was involved in the troubles of the French Revolution. He was a royalist in the Legislative Assembly of 1791-2, and his politics were monarchist and Catholic. As a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Public Instruction his set of three \"Considerations on the arts of design in France\" was offered before the Assemblée Nationale at a time (1791) when the continuation of the former academies was under question; he offered a program for their reform. in part by opening up the Paris salons. In 1791-92 he orchestrated the conversion of the Church of Ste-Geneviève in Paris (under the direction of Jean-Baptiste Rondelet) into the Panthéon, infilling the windows to give it the character of a mausoleum. In 1795 he was accused of taking part in the preparations for the royalist insurrection of \"13 vendémiaire\" and condemned to death, but acquitted in time.\n\nIn July 1796, Quatremere wrote a pseudo-epistolary treatise against the French plans to seize works of art from Rome, arguing that European powers should instead contribute a sum to the papacy for protecting art and knowledge. Shortly afterward, he was behind a petition signed by forty-seven Parisian artists including Jacques-Louis David which questioned the benefits of displacing art from Rome; although prudently worded, there was a vituperative official response.\n\nIn the same year he was elected to the Council of Five Hundred from the Seine department, then went into hiding after taking part in a royalist coup; in exile in Germany, he read Immanuel Kant and Gotthold Lessing, whose philosophy informed his own theories of aesthetics. In 1800, back in Paris, he was appointed secretary general of the Seine council. From 1816 until 1839 he was perpetual secretary to the \"Académie des Beaux-Arts\", which gave him great influence upon official architecture, and in 1818 he became a professor of archaeology at the Bibliothèque Nationale. He briefly returned to politics in 1820. In 1826 he became an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.\n\nQuatremère de Quincy was the author of numerous articles and books. From 1788 to 1825, he wrote the three Architecture volumes of the \"Encyclopédie Méthodique\". His \"Dictionnaire historique de l'Architecture\" was published in 1832-33. He wrote biographies of several artists: Antonio Canova (1823), Raphael (1824) and Michelangelo (1835).\n\nQuatremère de Quincy transformed the simple metaphor of architecture as language into a framework for reconceptualizing the structure of architecture; modern writers describing \"vernacular\" architecture, or the Baroque \"idiom\" or the \"vocabulary\" of Classicism owe a debt to Quatremère de Quincy\n\nHis essay \"De l'Architecture Égyptienne\", written for a competition posed by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1785 and published in 1803, just as the \"Description de l'Egypte\" was in preparation, nevertheless was an important influence on the Egyptian Revival phase of Neoclassical architecture, for its theoretical observations concerning the origins of architecture rather than for its historical naiveté. He was among the first to point out the use of polychromy in Greek sculpture and architecture. Though he insisted that landscape gardening could not be admitted among the fine arts, he was a key figure in the establishment of the first landscaped cemeteries, and his essay, translated into English as \"The Nature, the End and the Means of Imitation in the Fine Arts\" influenced J.

She has often played strong and complicated female characters, from fictional to literary, in both mainstream and independent films. Though her career has gone through certain periods of decline, she has gained a reputation for reinventing herself numerous times and has been credited for her ability to sustain her status.\n\nThe extramarital daughter of actors Gemini Ganesan and Pushpavalli, Rekha started her career in 1958 as a child actress in the Telugu film \"Inti Guttu\", though her film debut as a lead happened twelve years later with \"Sawan Bhadon\" (1970). Despite the success of several of her early films, she was often panned for her looks and weight, and it was not until later in the decade that change was taking place. Motivated by criticism, Rekha started working on her appearance and put effort into improving her acting technique and command of the Hindi language. Early recognition came for her performances in films such as \"Ghar\" and \"Muqaddar Ka Sikandar\" (both 1978). This period marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career, and she was one of Hindi cinema's leading stars through most of the 1980s until the early 1990s.\n\nFor her performance in the comedy \"Khubsoorat\" (1980) she received her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

While mostly prolific in popular Hindi cinema, during this time she ventured into arthouse films, a movement of neo-realist films known in India as parallel cinema. These films included dramas such as \"Kalyug\" (1981), \"Vijeta\" (1982) and \"Utsav\" (1984), and her portrayal of a classical courtesan in \"Umrao Jaan\" (1981) won her the National Film Award for Best Actress. In 1988, she starred as an avenger in \"Khoon Bhari Maang\", for which she won a second Best Actress award at Filmfare.\n\nHer work was much less frequent in subsequent decades. Her early roles in the 1990s mostly met with lukewarm reviews. In 1996, she took a negative turn of an underworld don in the action thriller \"Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi\" (1996), for which won a third Filmfare Award in the Best Supporting Actress category, and a year later appeared in \"\" and \"Aastha\" to critical acclaim but some public scrutiny. During the 2000s, she was praised for her supporting roles in the 2001 dramas \"Zubeidaa\" and \"Lajja\", and started playing mother roles, among which was her role in the science fiction \"Koi Mil Gaya\" (2003) and its superhero sequel \"Krrish\" (2006), both blockbusters. In 2010, she was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India.\n\nRekha's private life and public image have been the subject of frequent media interest and discussion. Her only marriage to Mukesh Aggarwal in 1990 ended a year later with his death. Her pairing opposite Amitabh Bachchan starting in the 1970s in a number of successful films was accompanied by speculation about a love affair between the two, which culminated in their starring film \"Silsila\" (1981), reflective of media projections. Her public image has often been tied to her perceived sex appeal. Rekha is reluctant to give interviews or discuss her life, which resulted in her being labelled a recluse.\n\nRekha was born in Madras on to Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan and Telugu actress Pushpavalli. Her father did not acknowledge his paternity during her childhood. Rekha has a sister, one half-brother and five half-sisters. It was in early 1970s, when she was looking for a footing in Bollywood, that she revealed her origins. Later, at the peak of her career, Rekha told a magazine interviewer that her father's neglect still rankled and that she had ignored his efforts at reconciliation. Her mother tongue is Telugu, although she has stated that she thinks in English.\n\nRekha attended Church Park convent school Tamil Nadu. At the age of 13, she quit school to start a career in acting. She did not have any personal aspirations in this direction, but the troubled financial state of her family compelled her to do so.\n\nRekha appeared as a child (credited as Baby Bhanurekha) in the Telugu film \"Intti Guttu\". After dropping out of school at age 13, she appeared in the Telugu film \"Rangula Ratnam\". She had no interest in acting and was basically forced to work to sustain her family financially, as her mother's salary would still not make ends meet. This was a difficult period in her life; still a teenager, adapting to her new surroundings was an uneasy process. Coming from the South, she did not speak Hindi and struggled to communicate with co-workers, and was constantly missing her mother, who was critically ill. Moreover, she was required to follow a strict diet. Recalling this phase, Rekha was later quoted as saying (Reacting to it, many years later, she said, \"I'm healed, I am not bitter anymore, I don't think I ever was.\"):\n\nRekha's first film as a lead was in the successful Kannada film \"Operation Jackpot Nalli C.I.D 999\" opposite Rajkumar in 1969. In that same year, she starred in her first Hindi film, \"Anjana Safar\". She later claimed that she was tricked into a kissing scene with the leading actor Biswajit for the overseas market, and the kiss made it to the Asian edition of \"Life\" magazine. The film ran into censorship problems, and would not be released until almost a decade later in 1979 (retitled as \"Do Shikaari\").\n\n1970 saw the release of the Hindi film \"Sawan Bhadon\", which was considered her acting debut in Bollywood. She had to learn Hindi, as that was not her naturally spoken language. \"Sawan Bhadon\" became a hit, and Rekha – a star overnight. Despite the success of the film, she was often scorned for her looks. Critics complimented her confidence and comic timing in the film, but made remarks about her weight. She subsequently got several offers but nothing of substance, as her roles were mostly just of a glamour girl. She was highly prolific during the decade, working on average in ten films a year, most of which were deemed potboilers and failed to propel her career forward in terms of roles and appreciation. She appeared in several commercially successful films at the time, including \"Raampur Ka Lakshman\" (1972), \"Kahani Kismat Ki\" (1973), and \"Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye\" (1974), yet she was not regarded for her acting abilities and—according to Tejaswini Ganti—\"the industry was surprised by her success as her dark complexion, plump figure, and garish clothing contradicted the norms of beauty prevalent in the film industry and in society.\" In 1975, she appeared in the war film \"Aakraman\"; Qurratulain Hyder called the film \"well-meaning but incredibly corny\" and labelled Rekha \"a clothes horse\".\n\nRekha recalls that the way she was perceived at that time motivated her to change her appearance and improve her choice of roles: \"I was called the 'Ugly Duckling' of Hindi films because of my dark complexion and South Indian features. I used to feel deeply hurt when people compared me with the leading heroines of the time and said I was no match for them. I was determined to make it big on sheer merit.\" This period marked the beginning of Rekha's physical transformation. She started paying attention to her make-up, dress sense, and worked to improve her acting technique and perfect her Hindi-language skills. To lose weight, she followed a nutritious diet, led a regular, disciplined life, and practised yoga, later recording albums to promote physical fitness. According to Khalid Mohamed, \"The audience was floored when there was a swift change in her screen personality, as well as her style of acting.\" She began choosing her film roles with more care; her first performance-oriented role came in 1976 when she played Amitabh Bachchan's ambitious and greedy wife in \"Do Anjaane\". An adaptation of Nihar Ranjan Gupta's Bengali novel \"Ratrir Yatri\", the film was directed by Dulal Guha and became a reasonable success with audiences and critics.\n\nHer most significant turning point, however, came in 1978, with her portrayal of a rape victim in the movie \"Ghar\". She played the role of Aarti, a newly married woman who gets gravely traumatised after being gang-raped. The film follows her character's struggle and recuperation with the help of her loving husband, played by Vinod Mehra. The film was considered her first notable milestone, and her performance was applauded by both critics and audiences. Dinesh Raheja from Rediff, in an article discussing her career, remarked, \"\"Ghar\" heralded the arrival of a mature Rekha. Her archetypal jubilance was replaced by her very realistic portrayal...\" She received her first nomination for Best Actress at the Filmfare Awards.\n\nIn that same year, she attained fame with \"Muqaddar Ka Sikandar\", in which she co-starred once again with Amitabh Bachchan. The movie was the biggest hit of that year, as well as one of the biggest hits of the decade, and Rekha was set as one of the most successful actresses of these times. The film opened to a positive critical reception, and Rekha's performance as a courtesan named Zohra, noted for a \"smouldering intensity\", earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare.\n\nIn 1980, Rekha appeared in the comedy \"Khubsoorat\", directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, with whom she had developed a strong father-daughter bond during their previous collaborations. In a role written specially for her, she played Manju Dayal, a young vivacious woman who visits her recently married sister at her in-law's house and tries to bring joy to the wide family, much to the displeasure of the matriarch of the household. Rekha said she easily identified with the bubbly nature of her character, calling it \"quite a bit me\". \"Khubsoorat\" was a success and Rekha was appreciated for her comic timing. It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film and Rekha won her first Best Actress award. \"The Tribune\" described the film as \"a lively comedy,\" noting that \"Rekha's spunky performance gives the film its natural zing.\" \"Film World\" magazine reported in that same year, \"Rekha's done it. Smoothly, successfully. From a plump, pelvis-jerking, cleavage-flashing temptress, she has metamorphosed into a sleek, accomplished actress. Gone are most of the inane mannerisms, pouts, wiggles and giggles.\" It further noted that her career prospects had begun to improve significantly, as leading filmmakers had started taking more notice of her and become more keen to cast her in their films.\n\nRekha starred opposite Bachchan in a number of films, most of which were hits. She also had an alleged love affair with him, which was widely reported on in the media, as well as sharply criticised, as he was a married man. Media interest and coverage of their alleged off-screen relationship culminated when they starred in Yash Chopra's drama \"Silsila\". The film was the most scandalous of their films together as it reflected the rumours by the press: Rekha played Bachchan's past love interest and current lover, while Bachchan's real-life wife, Jaya Bhaduri, played his wife. Rekha and Bachchan's relationship reportedly ended in 1981 while making the film. This was their last film together.\n\nCritics noted Rekha for having worked hard to perfect her Hindi and acting, and media reporters often discussed how she had transformed herself from a \"plump\" duckling to a \"swan\" in the early 1970s. Rekha's credits to this transformation were yoga, a nutritious diet, and a regular, disciplined life. In 1983, her diet and yoga practice were published in a book called \"Rekha's Mind and Body Temple\".\n\nIn 1981, she starred in \"Umrao Jaan\", a film adaptation of Mirza Hadi Ruswa's Urdu novel \"Umrao Jaan Ada\" (1905). Rekha played the title role of a courtesan and poet from 19th century Lucknow. The film follows Umrao's life story right from her days as a young girl named Amiran when she is kidnapped and sold in a brothel to her later position as a popular courtesan seeking happiness amid love affairs and other tribulations. Rekha once confessed, \"After reading the script, I had a strange feeling that I had Umrao in me.\" In preparation for the role, Rekha, who at the beginning of her career did not speak Hindi, took the task of learning the finer nuances of the Urdu language. Director Muzaffar Ali later noted that she had \"given more than my conception of the role\". The response to her work was universally positive. Her portrayal is considered to be one of her career-best performances, and she was awarded the National Film Award for Best Actress for it. She played a courtesan with a heart of gold in several of her films; \"Muqaddar Ka Sikandar\" and \"Umrao Jaan\" were followed by a number of films which had her playing similar roles.\n\nIn that same year, Rekha starred in Ramesh Talwar's family drama \"Baseraa\", which saw her playing a woman who marries her sister's husband, after the latter loses her mental balance. She appeared as Sadhna in the commercially successful \"Ek Hi Bhool\" (1981), opposite Jeetendra, playing the role of a betrayed wife who leaves her husband. In 1982, she received another Filmfare nomination for \"Jeevan Dhaara\", in which she played a young unmarried woman who is the sole breadwinner of her extended family. In 1983, she took the supporting role of a lawyer in \"Mujhe Insaaf Chahiye\", garnering another Filmfare nomination in the Supporting Actress category.\n\nDuring this period, Rekha was willing to expand her range beyond what she was given in mainstream films. She started working in arthouse pictures with independent directors, mostly under Shashi Kapoor's production, in what was used to be referred to as parallel cinema, an Indian New Wave movement known for its serious content and neo-realism. Her venture into this particular genre started off with \"Umrao Jaan\", and was followed by other such films as Shyam Benegal's award-winning drama, \"Kalyug\" (1981), Govind Nihalani's \"Vijeta\" (1982), Girish Karnad's \"Utsav\" (1984) and Gulzar's \"Ijaazat\" (1987), among others. Benegal's \"Kalyug\" is a modern-day adaptation of the Indian mythological epic Mahabharat, depicted as an archetypal-conflict between rival business houses. Rekha's role was that of Supriya, a character based on Draupadi. Benegal said he decided to cast her in the role after seeing her work in \"Khubsoorat\", besides noticing that she was \"very keen, very serious about her profession\". Critic and author Vijay Nair described her performance as \"a masterful interpretation of the modern Draupadi\". Madhu Trehan of \"India Today\" complimented her for playing \"flawlessly\" the part of \"a woman of intelligence, strength and a barely suppressed yearning for her young brother-in-law\".\n\nIn \"Vijeta\" she played a woman who struggles through her marital problems and tries to support her adolescent son, who, undecided about his future plans, eventually decides to join the Indian Air Force. She described her performance in the film as one of her favourite from her own repertoire. For her portrayal of Vasantsena in \"Utsav\", an erotic comedy based on the fourth-century Sanskrit play \"Mrichhakatika\" (\"The Little Clay Cart\"), she was acknowledged as the Best Actress (Hindi) of the year by the Bengal Film Journalists' Association. Maithili Rao wrote for \"Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema\", \"Rekha – forever the first choice for the courtesan's role, be it ancient Hindu India or 19th-century Muslim Lucknow – is all statuesque sensuality...\" In Gulzar's drama \"Ijaazat\", Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah star as a divorced couple who meet unexpectedly for the first time after years of separation at a railway station, and recall together their life as a married couple and the conflicts which brought about their eventual split.\n\nApart from parallel cinema, Rekha took on other increasingly serious, even adventurous roles; she was among the early actresses to play lead roles in heroine-oriented films, the first of which was \"Khoon Bhari Maang\" in 1988. She won her second Filmfare Award for her performance in the film. Rekha went on to describe \"Khoon Bhari Maang\" as \"the first and only film I concentrated and understood all throughout.\" One critic wrote about her performance in the film, \"Rekha as Aarti is just flawless and this is one of her best performances ever! In the first half as the shy and not so sexy Aarti she is excellent and after the plastic surgery as the model and femme fatale she is excellent too. Some scenes show that we are watching an actress of a very high calibre here.\" M.L. Dhawan from \"The Tribune\", while documenting the famous Hindi films of 1988, remarked that \"Khoon Bhari Maang\" was \"a crowning glory for Rekha, who rose like a phoenix ... and bedazzled the audience with her daredevilry.\" \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"'s \"Encyclopædia of Hindi Cinema\" listed her role in the film as one of Hindi cinema's memorable female characters, noting it for changing \"the perception of the ever-forgiving wife, turning her into an avenging angel.\" In a similar list by \"Screen\" magazine, the role was included as one of \"ten memorable roles that made the Hindi film heroine proud.\"\n\nIn later interviews, Rekha often described the moment she received the Filmfare Award for this role as a turning point, explaining that only then did she start genuinely enjoying her work and seeing it as more than \"just a job\": \"...when I went up on the stage, and received my award for \"Khoon Bhari Maang\"... Boom, it hit me! That's the first time I realised the value of being an actor and how much this profession meant to me.\" In 2011 she further stated, \"I felt even more charged to give my best and knew right then, that this was my calling, what I was born to do, to make a difference in people's lives, through my performances.\"\n\nThe 1990s saw a drop in Rekha's success. Few of her films were successful and many of her roles were condemned by reviewers. Critics did note, however, that unlike most of the actresses of her generation, like Hema Malini and Raakhee, who succumbed to playing character parts, typically of mothers and aunts, Rekha was still playing leading roles at a time when younger female stars rose to fame. The first year of the decade saw four releases featuring Rekha, including \"Mera Pati Sirf Mera Hai\" and \"Amiri Garibi\", all of which went unnoticed. Still recovering from the recent suicide of her husband and struggling with the ensuing press antagonism towards her, Rekha retained considerable success with her starring role as Namrata Singh, a young woman who joins the police force to avenge her husband's death in K. C. Bokadia's \"Phool Bane Angaray\" (1991). The film was a box-office hit and Rekha received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her work, in reference to which Subhash K. Jha remarked, \"Khaki never seemed sexier\". The public's acceptance of this film and \"Khoon Bhari Maang\" prompted several filmmakers to come with similar offers to Rekha, and she played such roles—labeled \"avenging angels\"—in several of her proceeding projects to a much less consequential effect. These included her next film \"Insaaf Ki Devi\" (1992), and later films such as \"Ab Insaf Hoga\" (1995) and \"Udaan\" (1997), all of which were major duds. She followed with a dual role of twin sisters in Shakti Samanta's \"Geetanjali\" opposite Jeetendra and the title role in the box-office disaster \"Madam X\", in which she starred as a young woman hired by the police to impersonate a female underworld don.\n\nHalfway through the decade, Rekha managed to halt her decline when she accepted several highly-controversial films, including \"\" and \"Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi\" (1996). \"Kama Sutra\", a foreign production directed by Mira Nair, was an erotic drama, and many felt her role of a Kama Sutra teacher in the film would damage her career. She was undeterred by the criticism. Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" described her as \"exquisitely composed\" in the part. \"Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi\", an action film directed by Umesh Mehra, was a major financial success, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of the year. It featured Rekha in her first negative role as Madam Maya, a vicious gangster woman running a secret business of illegal wrestling matches in the US, who, during the course of the film, romances the much younger Akshay Kumar. Her portrayal earned her several awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Star Screen Award for Best Villain. In spite of the positive response to her performance from both fans and critics, she maintained on more than one occasion that she did not like herself in the film, noting that her work was not up to her own, personal standards.\n\nAnother controversial film at that time was \"\" (1997), where Basu Bhattacharya, making the last film of his career, cast her as a housewife who moonlights as a prostitute. While her performance earned her positive notices and a Star Screen Award nomination, she was criticised by the audience for the nature of the part, to which she later replied, \"...people had a lot to say about my role... I don't have problems playing anything. I've reached a stage where I could do justice to any role that came my way. It could be role of a mother, a sister-in-law; negative, positive, sensational or anything.\" She next acted in \"Qila\" (1998) and \"Mother\" (1999).\n\nIn the 2000s, Rekha appeared in relatively few movies. She started the decade with \"Bulandi\", directed by Rama Rao Tatineni. The other was Khalid Muhammad's Zubeidaa, co starring Karisma Kapoor and Manoj Vajapayee playing the first wife Maharani Mandira Devi of the King.\n\nIn 2001, Rekha appeared in Rajkumar Santoshi's feminist drama \"Lajja\", an ensemble piece inspired by a true incident of a woman being raped in Bawanipur two years before. The film follows the journey of a runaway wife (Manisha Koirala) and unfolds her story in three main chapters, each one presenting the story of a woman at whose place she stops. Rekha was the protagonist of the final chapter, around which the film's inspiration revolves, playing Ramdulari, an oppressed Dalit village woman and social activist who becomes a victim of gangrape. Speaking of the film, Rekha commented, \"I am Lajja and Lajja is me\". Highly praised for her portrayal, she received several nominations for her work, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare. Taran Adarsh wrote that \"it is Rekha who walks away with the glory, delivering one of the finest performances the Indian screen has seen in the recent times.\"\nIn Rakesh Roshan's science-fiction film \"Koi... Mil Gaya\", Rekha played Sonia Mehra, a single mother to a developmentally disabled young man, played by Hrithik Roshan. The movie was a financial and critical success and became the most popular film of the year; it won the Filmfare Award for Best Film, among others. Rekha received another Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare for her performance, which Khalid Mohamed described as \"astutely restrained\".\n\nIn 2005, Rekha guest starred in an item number in connection with the song \"Kaisi Paheli Zindagani\", in Pradeep Sarkar's \"Parineeta\". In \"Bachke Rehna Re Baba\" (2005), Rekha played a con woman who, along with her niece, uses one scheme to rob men of their property. The film was a major critical failure. \"Mid Day\" remarked, \"why Rekha chose to sign this film is a wonder,\" noting that she is \"riddled with bad dialogue, terrible cakey makeup and tawdry styling\". This was followed in 2006 by \"Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana\", a poorly received sex comedy about four female friends and their personal troubles. In a scathing review, Indu Mirani noted that \"Rekha hams like she was never going to do another film.\" In a 2007 article by \"Daily News and Analysis\", critic Deepa Gahlot directed an advice to Rekha: \"Please pick movies with care, one more like \"Bach Ke Rehna Re Baba\" and \"Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana\" and the diva status is under serious threat.\"\n\nIn 2006, she reprised the role of Sonia Mehra in \"Krrish\", Rakesh Roshan's sequel to \"Koi... Mil Gaya\". In this superhero feature, the story moves 20 years forward and focuses on the character of Sonia's grandson Krishna (played again by Hrithik Roshan), whom she has brought up single-handedly after the death of her son Rohit, and who turns out to have supernatural powers. \"Krrish\" became the second-highest grossing picture of the year and, like its prequel, was declared a blockbuster. It received mostly positive notices from critics, and Rekha's work earned her another Filmfare nomination in the supporting category. Ronnie Scheib from \"Variety\" noted her for bringing \"depth to her role as the nurturing grandmother\".\n\nIn 2007, she once again portrayed a courtesan in Goutam Ghose's \"Yatra\". Unlike the initial success she experienced in playing such roles in the early stages of her career, this time the film failed to do well. In 2010, Rekha was awarded the Padma Shri, the 4th highest civilian award given by the Government of India.\n\nRekha has also been nominated as a Rajya Sabha member. She currently is the member of the Rajya Sabha (May 2012).\n\nRekha starred in the 2010 film \"Sadiyaan\" alongside Hema Malini and Rishi Kapoor. The film marked the debut of Shatrughan Sinha's son Luv Sinha. The film failed to do well at the box office.\n\nIn 2014, Rekha was working on Abhishek Kapoor's \"Fitoor\", but left the film due to unknown reasons and later Tabu was signed as her replacement. In 2014 she also worked in \"Super Nani\" released on Diwali (24 October). Super Nani was a family drama, in which the grandmother (Rekha) is unappreciated by her children and husband, Randhir Kapoor. Her grandson, Sharman Joshi convinces her to change. The grandmother 'transforms' herself into a glamorous model.\n\nIn 2015, she appeared in R. Balki's Shamitabh, where she played herself.\n\nIn 1990, Rekha married Delhi-based industrialist Mukesh Aggarwal. A few months later—while she was in London—he committed suicide, after several previous attempts, leaving a note, \"Don't blame anyone\". She was pilloried by the press at that time, a period which one journalist termed as \"the deepest trough in her life.\" Bhawana Somaaya observed the period speaking of \"a strong anti-wave against the actress — some called her a witch, some a murderess,\" but added that soon \"Rekha came out of the eclipse once again unblemished!\"\n\nShe was rumoured to have been married to actor Vinod Mehra in 1973, but in a 2004 television interview with Simi Garewal she denied being married to Mehra referring to him as a \"well-wisher\". Rekha currently lives in her Bandra home in Mumbai.\n\nShe was also rumoured to have been in a relationship with Amitabh Bachchan after they first acted together in \"Do Anjaane\", and later in \"Silsila\".\n\nIn 1986, \"The Illustrated Weekly of India\" wrote of Rekha, \"There has never been anyone quite like Rekha. Tempestuous woman. Troublemaker extraordinary. A woman once known, never quite forgotten. And an accomplished actress who can often startle you with a truly great performance.\" In 2011, Rediff listed her as the ninth-greatest Indian actress of all time, noting, \"It's hard not to be bowled over by Rekha's longevity, or her ability to reinvent herself... the actress took on a man's job and did it stunningly well, holding her own against all the top actors and being remembered despite them.\" \"Filmfare\" described her acting style, writing, \"...when it comes to style, sexiness or sheer onscreen presence, she's unparalleled... [she is] a fierce, raw, flinty performer with unbridled honesty. Her acting isn't gimmicky.\" Critic Khalid Mohamed commends her technical control: \"She knows how to give and to what degree. She has all that it takes to be a director. There is a kind of vulnerability in her control. She explores when she is acting.\" Shyam Benegal, who directed her in two movies, believes she is \"a director's actress\". M.L. Dhawan from \"The Tribune\" wrote, \"Rekha's flowering as an actress post \"Ghar\" and \"Khubsoorat\" climaxed in [...] \"Umrao Jaan\". As a tragic courtesan she gave a performance of quality artistry, adopting a much-admired huskiness and despondency of tone. Rekha communicated much with a delicately raised eyebrow. In 2010, \"Filmfare\" included two of her performances—from \"Khubsoorat\" (1980) and \"Umrao Jaan\" (1981)—in their list of \"80 Iconic Performances\". Her work in the latter was included on \"Forbes India\"'s list of \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\".\n\nRekha has often been compared to Greta Garbo, and has been cited by media as her Indian equivalent. \"Hindustan Times\" described her physical change and loss of weight as \"one of cinema's and perhaps\nreal life's most dramatic transformations,\" arguing that \"Rekha morphed from an overweight, dark ordinary girl into a glamorous and beautiful enigma, shrouding her life in an intriguing Garbo-like mystery.\" According to Rediff, \"Rekha's reclusive nature has gone a long way towards building an aura of mystery around her.\" Rekha rarely gives interviews, and she mostly avoids parties and events. Asked once about her mysterious image, she denied several times trying to live up to this image, asserting it is press-created: \"What mystery? The media is the one that creates this image. It's just that I am basically shy by nature, an introvert and fiercely private.\" Film journalist Anupama Chopra, who visited Rekha in 2003, wrote that while tabloids had portrayed her as \"a reclusive woman twisted bitter by lecherous men and loneliness\", in reality Rekha was \"none of these\", describing her as \"chatty and curious, excited and energetic, cheerful and almost illegally optimistic\".\n\nWriting for \"The Tribune\", Mukesh Khosla spoke of her transformation, writing, \"From the giggling village belle in \"Saawan Bhadon\" to one of country's reigning actresses, Rekha has come a long way.\" According to critic Omar Qureshi, \"the term diva (in India) was coined for Rekha.\" Mira Nair, who directed Rekha in \"Kama Sutra\" (1997), likens her to a \"Jamini Roy painting\" and says, \"Like Marilyn Monroe is shorthand for sex, Rekha is shorthand for charisma\". Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali labels her the \"last of the great stars\".\n\nShe was referred to as the reigning Queen of Indian Cinema at the 2012 IIFA Awards held in Singapore, where she was given the \"Outstanding Contribution to Indian Cinema (Female)\" award, also referred to as the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\n"}

He is a former amateur cyclist and received a professional contract in 1967; instead of turning professional, he saw a future in sports journalism after writing articles in cycling magazines about races in which he participated.\n\nLiggett initially wrote for \"Cycling\" magazine, and moved on to do freelance work for \"The Guardian\", the \"Daily Telegraph\" and \"The Observer\". In 1997, he was appointed \"Cycle Sport\" magazine's international editor. He has also written books on cycle racing.\n\nLiggett has reported on 15 Olympic Games and 44 Tours de France, generally alongside fellow veteran cycling commentators and former cyclists Paul Sherwen (UK) and Bob Roll (US). Liggett has covered other sports including triathlons and ski jumping. Because of his varied assignments, Liggett has worked for all of the American Big Three networks: ABC, CBS, and NBC.\n\nLiggett has also been associated with the Australian network SBS covering Australian events such as the Tour Down Under in addition to the Tour de France. In 2010, he covered Johannesburg's 94.7 Cycle Challenge for South Africa's SuperSport. Liggett also commentated for London 2012 with Australian broadcaster Foxtel.\n\nBetween 1972 and 1993, Liggett was technical director of the Milk Race. His involvement with organising cycle racing events led to his becoming vice-president of the \"Association Internationale Organisateurs des Courses Cycliste\". In 1973, age 30, Liggett became the youngest ever UCI international commissaire.\n\nLiggett has been president of the Cyclists' Touring Club (CTC), Britain's national cyclists' organisation.\n\nIn 2009, he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame.\n\nLiggett was a long-time supporter of Lance Armstrong and was a regular speaker at \"Livestrong\" functions along with his Tour De France co-presenter Paul Sherwen. He repeatedly defended Armstrong, challenging the investigations which he called \"a waste of money\". When Floyd Landis tested positive at the 2006 Tour de France Liggett denigrated the verdict saying \"The fact that the lab knew whose sample it was testing is just one of the anomalies\", but when Landis admitted to doping in 2010 and implicated Armstrong, Liggett dismissed it as \"sour grapes\" and called the accusations \"ridiculous\". He also stated that UCI President Pat McQuaid was \"vehemently anti doping\".\n\nIn 2012 after the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) had stripped Armstrong of his Tour de France titles, Liggett claimed on South African Radio to have proof that unnamed politicians motivated by jealousy had fabricated the evidence against Armstrong by bribing witnesses. This provoked an angry response from USADA, who dismissed his claims, and a comprehensive, point by point, rebuttal by Michael Ashenden PhD, a leading doping expert. In October 2012 Liggett maintained his defence of Armstrong, calling the investigation a \"witch hunt\" without evidence. Later that month, in a documentary by ABC's \"Four Corners\" entitled \"The World According to Lance\", he stated that he now found it difficult to believe that Armstrong had never doped and that he was disappointed that Armstrong had lied to him in 2003 when asked about doping.\n\nLiggett's home town is Bebington, Wirral, though he now lives in Bayford, Hertfordshire. He spends most of his leisure time in South Africa where he has a house in the Western Cape and a game farm near the Kruger National Park.\n\nIn 2005, Liggett was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to cycling.\n\n\n"}

These proofs are used in the article Addition of natural numbers.\n\nThis article will use the Peano axioms for the definitions of addition of the natural numbers, and the successor function S(a). In particular:\n\nFor the proof of commutativity, it is useful to define another natural number closely related to the successor function, namely \"1\". We define 1 to be the successor of 0, in other words,\n\nNote that for all natural numbers \"a\",\n\nWe prove associativity by first fixing natural numbers \"a\" and \"b\" and applying induction on the natural number \"c\".\n\nFor the base case \"c\" = 0,\n\nEach equation follows by definition [A1]; the first with \"a\" + \"b\", the second with \"b\".\n\nNow, for the induction. We assume the induction hypothesis, namely we assume that for some natural number \"c\",\n\nThen it follows,\n\nIn other words, the induction hypothesis holds for \"S\"(\"c\"). Therefore, the induction on \"c\" is complete.\n\nDefinition [A1] states directly that 0 is a right identity.\nWe prove that 0 is a left identity by induction on the natural number \"a\".\n\nFor the base case \"a\" = 0, 0 + 0 = 0 by definition [A1].\nNow we assume the induction hypothesis, that 0 + \"a\" = \"a\".\nThen\n\nThis completes the induction on \"a\".\n\nWe prove commutativity (\"a\" + \"b\" = \"b\" + \"a\") by applying induction on the natural number \"b\". First we prove the base cases \"b\" = 0 and \"b\" = \"S\"(0) = 1 (i.e. we prove that 0 and 1 commute with everything).\n\nThe base case \"b\" = 0 follows immediately from the identity element property (0 is an additive identity), which has been proved above:\n\"a\" + 0 = \"a\" = 0 + \"a\".\n\nNext we will prove the base case \"b\" = 1, that 1 commutes with everything, i.e. for all natural numbers \"a\", we have \"a\" + 1 = 1 + \"a\". We will prove this by induction on \"a\" (an induction proof within an induction proof). We have proved that 0 commutes with everything, so in particular, 0 commutes with 1: for \"a\" = 0, we have 0 + 1 = 1 + 0. Now, suppose \"a\" + 1 = 1 + \"a\". Then\n\nThis completes the induction on \"a\", and so we have proved the base case \"b\" = 1. Now, suppose that for all natural numbers \"a\", we have \"a\" + \"b\" = \"b\" + \"a\". We must show that for all natural numbers \"a\", we have \"a\" + \"S\"(\"b\") = \"S\"(\"b\") + \"a\". We have\n\nThis completes the induction on \"b\".\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his work on \"2000 AD\", especially the flagship titles \"Judge Dredd\" and \"Rogue Trooper\".\n\nFollowing work in commercial art in his hometown of Glasgow, Kennedy went freelance and worked as an illustrator on D.C. Thomson's \"Commando\", a well-known British war comic, between 1967 and 1972, before leaving comics altogether to become a professional fine artist. Kennedy's work has been described as gritty, energetic, chunky and raw.\n\nIn 1978 he was lured back to comics work again, beginning by drawing the \"Fighting Mann\" (1980-81) strip for Fleetway Publications' \"Battle\" comic. As \"Battle\" began to wind down, Kennedy moved across to its stablemate, the weekly sci-fi anthology comic \"2000 AD\"\n\nWorking during the title's \"Golden Era\", Kennedy was instrumental in several well-known strips that continue to this day, including \"The V.C.s\" (written by Gerry Finley-Day, \"Judge Dredd\" (with John Wagner and Alan Grant, most notably on the \"Midnight Surfer\" story which reintroduced Chopper) and \"Rogue Trooper\" (again with Finley-Day). His association with the comic, which is largely produced by fellow Scotsmen, has never faltered: in 2005, Kennedy designed and produced a brand new strip, \"Zancudo\", written by Simon Spurrier for the \"Judge Dredd Megazine\", and Wagner has written three stories about character Kenny Who?, an alter-ego for Kennedy, based on Kennedy's early problems getting work at American companies (as well as making jokes on issues like creator's rights and censorship).\n\nIn America, Kennedy established a profitable working relationship with writer Tom Veitch, producing the creator-owned Vietnam War-inspired science fiction fantasy \"The Light and Darkness War\" for Marvel Comics' Epic imprint. This led to the pair working on a Star Wars spin-off, \"Dark Empire\", for Dark Horse Comics. Kennedy has worked on other Star Wars licensed comics, including Boba Fett stories with writer John Wagner. For DC Comics Kennedy has worked on \"Lobo\", \"Batman\", \"Outcasts\" and \"The Spectre\". For Marvel, he has illustrated the \"Punisher\", \"Daredevil\" and \"Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"\n\nAs part of the UNESCO City of Literature in 2007 he has drawn \"Kidnapped\", an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Kidnapped\", written by Alan Grant, published by Waverley Books.

A good faith estimate (or a loan estimate) is a standard form intended to be used to compare different offers (or quotes) from different lenders or brokers.\nThe estimate must include an itemized list of fees and costs associated with the loan and must be provided within 3 business days of applying for a loan. Since RESPA does not apply to Business Purpose Loans, no GFE is provided in those transactions.\n\nThese mortgage fees, also called settlement costs or closing costs, cover every expense associated with a home loan, including inspections, title insurance, taxes and other charges.\n\nThe good faith estimate is only an estimate. The final closing costs may be different; however the difference can only be 10% of the third party fees. Once a good faith estimate is issued the lender/broker cannot change the fees in the origination box.\n\nThe fees included within a good faith estimate fall into six basic categories:\n\n\nThe following is a list of the typical charges. Each charge starts with a number – the same number as the number of the charge on a HUD-1 Real Estate Settlement Statement. This makes it easier to compare the charges a loan applicant receives on the good faith estimate to the HUD-1.\n\n800 ITEMS PAYABLE IN CONNECTION WITH LOAN:\n\nThis fee is a charge for originating or creating the loan\n\nThis is an upfront charge paid to the lender to get a lower mortgage rate – the same as “buying the rate down”\n\nThis is the cost of the independent appraisal. It is usually paid by the buyer.\n\nThis is the cost of the credit report\n\nThis is the lender's cost of inspecting a property – some may double check the appraisal provided by an independent appraiser\n\nThis is the upfront charge that a mortgage broker charges. Brokers can also earn a “rebate” from the lender which is not listed here\n\nLender fee, usually small, for handling tax related matters\n\nThis is the charge for processing the loan – collecting the buyer's application, running credit, collecting pay stubs, bank statements, ordering appraisal, title, etc.\n\nThis is the cost of the loan underwriter (approver)\n\nThis is the cost of wiring the money around, which is usually done by escrow.\n\n900 ITEMS REQUIRED BY LENDER TO BE PAID IN ADVANCE\n\nThis is the prepaid interest for a mortgage loan.\n\nThis is the prepaid mortgage insurance premium, if needed. This is the insurance premium some lenders charge for loans with little equity.\n\nThis is used to record hazard insurance premiums that must be paid at settlement in order to have immediate insurance on the property. It is not used for insurance reserves that will go into escrow.\n\nThis is the Veterans Administration funding fee, which is only applicable if the loan is through a VA program.\n\n1000 RESERVES DEPOSITED WITH LENDER\n\nThis is any prepayment of future hazard insurance expense\n\nThis is any prepayment of future mortgage insurance expense\n\nThis is any prepayment of future school tax expense\n\nThis is any prepayment of future tax expenses, such as property taxes\n\nThis is any prepayment of future flood insurance expense\n\nThis is a credit to the buyer. By law, the lender is not allowed to collect more than the sum of initial payments for reserve items. The aggregate adjustment is the amount the lender must 'credit' the borrower at closing, so that they don't collect more than the law allows.\n\n1100 TITLE CHARGES\n\nThis is the cost of escrow. This is the service of a neutral party that actually handles the money between all the different parties in a real estate transaction, including: the lender, the buyer, the seller, the agents, notary, etc. This is often done by the “Title Company” – a related entity in the same office that provides title insurance\n\nThis is the charge for preparing the loan documents. Lenders often email the loan documents to the escrow company, which in turn prints them out and reviews them before signing. However, some title companies are owned by an attorney who will also draw certain legal documents for the buyer's closing.\n\nThis is the cost of the notary. This is to have all of the legal documents surrounding this transaction notarized. When closing inside the title company office, there is usually no charge for this.\n\nAny legal charges associated with clearing the title to the property.\n\nThis is the cost of insuring the title of the property. If there is a question about title (who really owned the property), or if a judgment or lien was really paid off, after the transaction is done then this insurance protects the lender and owner from future problems.\n\n1200 GOVERNMENT RECORDING & TRANSFER CHARGES\n\nThis is the cost of updating relevant government records\n\nUnavoidable government charge\n\nUnavoidable government charge\n\nMany counties now allow documents to be recorded electronically. This expedites the issuance of a title policy by several weeks.\n\n1300 ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT CHARGES\n\nAnything 'extra' that is not included in the 800-1200 charges are itemized in the 1300 section. This includes things like the survey, HOA fees, and repairs.\n\nThis is the cost of the pest inspector. Their purpose is to document the state of the property that the lender is making the loan on.\n\n\n"}

It is one of England's main hospitals for coronary care and respiratory diseases. It is a tertiary referral university teaching hospital, with a strong international reputation for medical research in cardiac and respiratory health. It is managed by the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.\n\nGlenfield Hospital is a modern hospital that was built in several phases the first phase of which was completed in October 1984. A formal opening ceremony was conducted by the Duchess of Kent in March 1986. A second phase to the hospital followed in 1989.\n\nIn December 2017, surgeons announced successful surgery on a baby girl born with her heart and part of her stomach growing externally. The treatment, which was carried out by a team of fifty, required three operations and the child is believed to be the \"first baby in UK to survive with the extremely rare condition.\"\n\nIn July 2012 it was announced that the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre which served 5 million people and treated 230 children and 70 adults a year, would close to focus surgical expertise in fewer locations. The unit would however continue to provide diagnosis and non-surgical treatment. The unit had the largest ECMO unit in the UK and had been in operation for 20 years and a petition to save it attracted 100,000 signatures.\nIn a letter to Andrew Lansley, ECMO expert Kenneth Palmer of the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm warned that about 50 babies and children will die over a five-year period if treatment moved to Birmingham. Palmer said that Leicester and Stockholm were world-leading ECMO centres with survival rates about 10% to 20% higher than the normal rate elsewhere.\n\nIn August 2012, it was announced that the hospital had carried out the world's first percutaneous coronary intervention procedure on a two-year-old child.\nThe child had been born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a deformed left heart and had had two heart operations before his first birthday. A life-threatening clot had formed in the heart and was successfully removed drawing on the combined experience of paediatric and adult interventional cardiologists. The combined expertise may not be available in alternate facilities if Glenfield children's cardiac care unit closes. Campaigners in Leeds won a legal challenge criticising the fairness and legality of the review process in March 2013 and the plans were suspended in June \"as the decision was based on a flawed analysis.\"\n\nIn July 2015, NHS England announced that following a \"conclusive, open and transparent and rigorous\" review, the heart unit would move to a new paediatric unit at the Leicester Royal Infirmary. The unit would employ 4 surgeons and take more cases becoming operational by April 2016. A year later, the hospital was told it had failed newly imposed congenital heart surgery standards and would close. Liz Kendall claimed that the unit was one of the \"best performing surgical centres\" in England and the decision wasn't justified – a view shared by both John Adler, the chief executive of University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and Leicestershire County Council. According to the unit's former head, Professor Giles Peek, the hospital supported every other hospital in the region and its closure could seriously damage paediatric services. According to the trust website, its Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation facility, the largest of 5 in the UK, is the largest in Europe and one of the busiest in the world. It first provided treatment in 1989.\nOn 29 October hundreds of people marched to protest about its proposed April 2017 closure with Adler reiterating that clinical outcomes were \"amongst the best in the country\" though NHS England said it wouldn't meet the mininimum number of operations required by the new standards. The \"Leicester Mercury\" reported that more than 1000 people took part, most of them with family stories to tell. The organisers hope to get sufficient signatures for a debate in Parliament.\n\nIn November 2017, an NHS England board meeting in London conditionally agreed to continue the unit's work provided it moves to the Leicester Royal Infirmary and the unit's workload is increased as promised up to 2021.\n\n"}

He was a professor of natural philosophy (the precursor of natural science) at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nA member of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society when it received its royal warrant, he was appointed as the first general secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1783–98). Robison invented the siren and also worked with James Watt on an early steam car. Following the French Revolution, Robison became disenchanted with elements of the Enlightenment. He authored \"Proofs of a Conspiracy\" in 1797—a polemic accusing Freemasonry of being infiltrated by Weishaupt's Order of the Illuminati. His son was the inventor Sir John Robison (1778–1843).\n\nThe son of John Robison, a Glasgow merchant, he was born in Boghall, Baldernock, Stirlingshire (now East Dunbartonshire) and attended Glasgow Grammar School and the University of Glasgow (MA 1756). After a brief stay in London in 1758 Robison became the tutor to the midshipman son of Admiral Knowles, sailing with the Royal Navy on General Wolfe's expedition to Quebec and Portugal (1756–62). His mathematical skills were employed in navigation and surveying. Returning to Britain in 1762, he joined the Board of Longitude — a team of scientists who tested John Harrison’s marine chronometer on a voyage to Jamaica.\n\nSubsequently he settled in Glasgow engaging in the practical science of James Watt and Joseph Black in opposition to the systematic continental European chemistry of Antoine Lavoisier and its adherents such as Joseph Priestley. In 1766 he succeeded Black as Professor of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow. He in turn was succeeded in 1770 by Black's assistant, William Irvine.\n\nIn 1769, he announced that balls with like electrical charges repel each other with a force that varies as the inverse-square of the distance between them, anticipating Coulomb's law of 1785.\n\nIn 1770 he travelled to Saint Petersburg as the secretary of Admiral Charles Knowles, where he taught mathematics to the cadets at the Naval Academy at Kronstadt, obtaining a double salary and the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nRobison moved to Scotland in 1773 and took up the post of Professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. He lectured on mechanics, hydrostatics, astronomy, optics, electricity and magnetism. His conception of mechanical philosophy’ became influential in nineteenth-century British physics. His name appears in the 1776 \"Minute Book of The Poker Club\", a crucible of the Scottish Enlightenment. In 1783 he became General Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1797 his articles for the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" gave a good account of the scientific, mathematical and technological knowledge of the day. He also prepared for publication, in 1799, the chemical lectures of his friend and mentor, Joseph Black.\n\nRobison worked with James Watt on an early steam car. This project came to nothing and has no direct connection to Watt's later improvement of the Newcomen steam engine. He along with Joseph Black and others gave evidence about Watt's originality and their own lack of connection to his key idea of the Separate Condenser.\n\nRobison did however invent the siren, though it was Charles Cagniard de la Tour who named it after producing an improved model.\n\nTowards the end of his life, he became an enthusiastic conspiracy theorist, publishing \"Proofs of a Conspiracy ...\" in 1797, alleging clandestine intrigue by the \"Illuminati\" and Freemasons (the work's full title was \"Proofs of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and Governments of Europe, carried on in the secret meetings of Freemasons, Illuminati and Reading Societies\"). The secret agent monk, Alexander Horn provided much of the material for Robison's allegations. French priest Abbé Barruel independently developed similar views that the \"Illuminati\" had infiltrated Continental Freemasonry, leading to the excesses of the French Revolution. In 1798, the Reverend G. W. Snyder sent Robison's book to George Washington for his thoughts on the subject in which he replied to him in a letter:\n\nIt was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the \"Lodges\" of Free Masons in \"this\" Country had, as \"Societies,\" endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of separation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the \"founder,\" or \"instrument\" employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a separation of the \"People\" from their \"Government\" in view, is too evident to be questioned.\n\nModern conspiracy theorists, such as Nesta Webster and William Guy Carr, believe the methods of the Illuminati as described in \"Proofs of a Conspiracy\" were copied by radical groups throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in their subversion of benign organizations. Spiritual Counterfeits Project editor Tal Brooke has compared the views of \"Proofs of a Conspiracy\" with those found in Carroll Quigley's \"Tragedy and Hope\" (Macmillan, 1966). Brooke suggests that the New World Order, which Robison believed Adam Weishaupt (founder of the Illuminati) had in part accomplished through the infiltration of Freemasonry, will now be completed by those holding sway over the international banking system (e.g., by means of the Rothschilds' banks, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

An uncle, who was a member of the priesthood, gave him instruction until the age of 15, when he passed the entrance exam for the University of Padua. He was a pupil of Giovanni Battista Morgagni and Marc Antonio Caldani. Under the former, he became doctor of medicine on 19 May 1770; in 1772, he became professor at the University of Modena.\n\nFor a time he chose to travel, visiting Holland, France and England.

The population of the Wigan ward called Shevington and Lower Ground had increased to 11,482 at the 2011 Census.\n\nLying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire, Shevington lies approximately from Wigan town centre, from Skelmersdale and at the 2001 census had a population of 9,786.\n\nShevington, a farmstead near a hill called \"shevin\", derives from the Celtic \"cevn\" meaning a ridge and the Old English \"tun\", a farmstead. It is a hill slope settlement in the Douglas Valley recorded in documents in 1225 as Shefington. Other recorded spellings include Scheuynton in 1253, Sheuington in 1277, Sewinton 1288 and Sheuynton in 1292.\n\nShevington became a manor, an estate system of local government held of the king by a lord of the manor from the 12th to the 18th centuries. The area was included within the ecclesiastical parish of Standish until 1887 when it was granted separate status with the consecration of St Anne's Church.\n\nFrom earliest times the area had a sparse and scattered population eking out a living from the common and wood and farmlands owned by the church including Burscough Priory, Cockersand Abbey and the Knights Hospitallers until the Dissolution of the Monasteries from 1536 and that of the local gentry included Sir Adam Banastre, Lord of the Manor in 1288 and the Standish, Catterall, Stanley, Rigby, Hulton, Dicconson and Hesketh families – the last being the last lord of the manor in 1798.\n\nIn Tudor times only a handful of families existed, possibly as few as 30, the population reached 335 by 1764, and the first official census in 1801 recorded 646. The 1851 census 1,147, 1,753 in 1,901, reaching 3,057 by 1951 and 8,001 in 1971.\n\nBy the 18th century most of the common land had been enclosed forming landed estates and tenant farms where mixed farming was practised. Corn was ground into flour at local water mills – Finch Mill on the Calico Brook and Standish Mill on Mill Brook and skills associated with agriculture developed – smithies, wheelwrights and so on. Handloom weaving and basket making were also undertaken together with primitive coal mining in the Elnup Woods area.\n\nDemand for coal mining during the Industrial Revolution led to an intensification of mining with coal from many local pits transported via the River Douglas at Gathurst when the river was made navigable in 1742 but replaced from the 1780s by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal when much of the coal was loaded on to barges at Crooke.\nPast industries have included a glue factory and brick and tile works in Appley Bridge and the Roburite Explosives Works (now Orica) at Gathurst from 1941-42 which employed over 500 workers during the Second World War, but was first established south of the River Douglas in 1888.\n\nShevington's scattered communities became more cohesive with the development of the village school from 1814, residential development from the 1850s the original Plough & Harrow public house, post office and shops near or in the long-recognised centre of the village at Broad o' th' Lane.\n\nAnciently Shevington lay in the hundred of Leyland in Lancashire, it was a township in the parish of Standish and in 1837 became part of the Poor Law Union of Wigan.\nIn 1894 under the Local Government Act the village achieved the status of a parish council which included Shevington Vale, part of Appley Bridge, Shevington Moor and Crooke within its ancient boundaries defined by the Calico Brook, Almond Brook, Mill Brook and the River Douglas.\nSince local government reforms which took place in 1974, Shevington has formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan of Greater Manchester, having previously been part of the administrative county of Lancashire.\n\nFollowing the local elections in May 2012, Shevington now has three Labour District Councillors. This is the first time since 2006 that Labour has held all three seats.\n\nThe village currently has a parish council, which receives a precept from the Council Tax.\n\nShevington is built on sloping land between Standish and Wigan to the north-east of the River Douglas. Its area is . The underlying rocks are coal measures. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs parallel to the River Douglas.\nShevington is located close to Junction 27 of the M6 motorway and is bordered by the villages of Appley Bridge and Standish, but also has close links to the villages of Wrightington and Standish Lower Ground.\n\nToday there is little evidence of past industrial activity though there has been a marked increase in residential development between the 1950s and 1980s attracted by Shevington's pleasant rural setting, still surrounded by much open land and ancient woods. Further residential development, on the former Orica site to the south of the village, is currently underway with an expected completion date of late 2012. The 2001 census recorded a population of 11,725 in the Shevington with Lower Ground ward.\n\nShevington High School is a secondary school. There are four primary schools in and around the village; Millbrook Primary School, St. Bernadette's Roman Catholic Primary School, Shevington Vale Primary School and Shevington Community Primary School. Unusually, the primary school associated with St. Anne's Church in Shevington is in the neighbouring village of Standish Lower Ground.\n\nShevington has good communications via the M6 motorway (junction 27) which progressed through the parish in 1963 and the Manchester to Southport Line railway, with stations at Gathurst and Appley Bridge which first opened in the 1850s.\nFrom these stations there are direct rail links to both Southport and Manchester, as well as connections at Wigan to the West Coast Main Line.\nThere is also a connection to the M58 motorway via nearby junction 26 of the M6.\n\nThere are three churches and two vicarages in Shevington, the oldest being St. Anne's Church. There is also Shevington Methodist Church and St. Bernadette's Roman Catholic Church. All three churches provide worship for Christians and social and community activities for the whole village.\n\nThe Shevington community consists of a mixture of private and council housing, predominantly centred on two rows of shops in the centre of the village. Shevington has two pharmacies, two newsagents, a post office, a small supermarket, two bakers' shops, a carpet shop, a fish and chip shop, an estate agent, two hairdressers, a hardware store, three takeaways, a Conservative club and a public house. There is also a clinic, a doctors' surgery and a library.\n\nShevington also has a public park, containing a war memorial to those lost during the 20th century's both world wars.\n\nShevington has an amateur rugby league club called Shevington Sharks who play in the North West Counties League. Home games are played at St. John Rigby College. The Shevington football, Shevington Strikers, plays its matches on the recreation ground behind the Methodist church.\nGathurst Golf Club is also in the village.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

At the time Randle Cotgrave thought the name was just a synonym for Trump. The game was also known as Slamm, a less popular form was called Whist, and it was closely related to Ruffe and Trump described by Francis Willughby.\n\nWillughby speculated that there was an earlier simple trick-taking game without the ruff and honours. Cavendish and others state that ruff and honours was a descendant of the French game of Triomphe (→ Middle English \"triumph\" → Modern English \"trump\"). Triomphe, known as French Ruff in England, was a five-card game using a shortened deck, an up-turned trump card and played either in partnership or singlehandedly with 2-7 players. The earliest reference to a card game called \"Triumph\" in English is a 1522 translation of a French book. The earliest reference of \"Triumph\" being played in England is in a sermon by Hugh Latimer in 1529. The earliest mention of Triomphe goes back to France in the 1480s.\n\nRuff originates from an obscure 15th-century Italian game known as Ronfa and probably entered the English language through the French equivalent of Ronfle where it meant \"point\" as formerly in the game of Piquet. By the late 16th-century, due to confusion by English players, ruff acquired its English meaning of \"to trump\".\n\nThe game has been reconstructed from Cotton's \"ruff and honours\" and Willughby's similar \"ruffe and trump\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They were the main strike force of the anarchists. They were created in the Summer of 1917 in Ukraine by Maria Nikiforova, and expanded in January 1918 to Moscow, under the control of anarchists at industrial enterprises by Factory and Plant Committees and by Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups cells.\n\nMaria Nikiforova organized the Black Guards' first unit. Nikiforova, often known by her nickname Marusya, was a Ukrainian anarchist organiser who put together the first Black Guards cell in the city of Alexandrovsk in the Ukraine. Nikiforova, who is often compared to Joan of Arc, due to her important role in a male dominated conflict from a young age, started the first\nBlack Guards cell in an attempt to bring the land reform and wealth redistribution called for by the peasants to fruition. Nikiforova, a self-proclaimed terrorist, directed her unit of Black Guards to terrorize the Alexandrovsk local government in order to achieve the political change she desired. Later similar cells were established by Nestor Makhno throughout other portions of the Ukraine. Makhno led a \"Robin Hood-like existence\" during the revolution, seizing land and distributing wealth among the peasants.\n\nOn the night of April 11, 1918, Dzerzhinsky, director of the Cheka, had a force of approximately 5,000 Soviet troops attack the anarchist headquarters in Moscow.\n\nThere was no need to mount a negative political campaign as part of the suppression of the Black Guards because the Black Guards had no political power or support; their power was simply derived from their military strength. Russian revolutionary writer Victor Serge, who was initially part of anarchist movement, believed that much of the Black Guards real capacities was \"wasted on small and chaotic struggles.\"\n\nUltimately the legacy of the Black Guards was its serving as a model for the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, otherwise known as the Black Army. Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Nestor Makhno formed a Black Guards unit in Ukraine that would later grow into what was formally known as the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine (RIAU). The RIAU may have been considered a continuation of the Black Guards if it were not on a far larger, more organized, and unified scale.\n\n"}

It is situated approximately 22 km east of Quedlinburg, and 45 km northwest of Halle (Saale).\n\nAschersleben was first mentioned in 753, making it the oldest town of Saxony-Anhalt. The Latin name of the town's castle, \"Ascharia\", provided the name of the House of Ascania. From 1252–1315 Aschersleben was the capital of Anhalt-Aschersleben, after which it passed to the Bishopric of Halberstadt. After the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, it became part of the Principality of Halberstadt. Aschersleben became part of the Prussian Province of Saxony in 1815.\n\nA Junkers serial fuselage production facility was located in Aschersleben during the time of Nazi Germany. In April 1935 tools were transferred to Aschersleben, and by May 1935 the first fuselages were built there. The facility was located in the Wilslebener Strasse 9 near the so-called Seewiesen, where an airfield was erected as well. The Aschersleben shop area reached 564,000 square metres and about 6,000 people were employed at it.\n\nDuring World War II, a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp was located in the town. It was established to provide slave labour for Junkers (aircraft) and Motorenwerk (automotive).\n\nSince July 1944 about 950 KZ prisoners were forced to work at the Junkers Flugzeugwerke in Aschersleben. In April 1945 the production was ceased. On 17 April U.S. forces occupied Aschersleben, but on 23 May the city was handed over to the British forces and later on 1 July it was finally handed over to the Soviets.\n\nAschersleben was bombed on the following dates during the war:\n\nAt the end of World War II Junkers-Aschersleben was mostly intact and the production was just changing for the production of the jet fighter Heinkel He 162. Most installations were dismantled and transferred to Kiev in the Soviet Union by the Soviets in 1946. The remaining facility buildings at Aschersleben were later used by VEB Kombinat Fritz Heckert. Today the area is used by Schiess AG.\n\nAschersleben was part of East Germany until 1990, when it became part of Saxony-Anhalt during German reunification. On 1 January 2008, the municipalities of Drohndorf, Freckleben and Mehringen were incorporated into Aschersleben.\n\nSeveral architectural styles are represented in Aschersleben. The historic centre is dominated by romanesque (\"Grauer Hof\"), gothic (St. Stephani Church), renaissance (City Hall, \"Krukmannsches Haus\") and baroque architecture.\n\nThere is a ring of buildings in neoclassical and Jugendstil styles around the historic Old Town. This, in turn, is surrounded and interspersed with buildings of early modernism like the Heckner-Bauten and buildings from the GDR era. Large new areas are mainly in the north and south-east of the city.\n\nAschersleben is one of few German towns showing large segments of the medieval city wall preserved through the centuries, although often integrated into later residential buildings. The city wall defines a promenade ring around the historic Old Town. In the 19th century, several city gates and towers had been demolished, but out of 51 towers and bastions there are still 15 existing.\nThere are few half-timbered buildings in the old town of Aschersleben. The reasons for this is the availability of good stone material and the absence of large forests in the vicinity, as well as numerous fires before the 16th century. Nevertheless, there are numerous buildings, which are partly half-timbered, usually the upper floors.\n\n\nWendell Lewis Willkie (1892–1944) was the Republican Party (GOP) nominee for the 1940 presidential election.

Though minor cases of DAMP are roughly defined as a combination of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and a pervading attention deficit, severe cases are seen to exhibit 5 properties of DAMP: Problems of attention, gross and fine motor skills, perceptual deficits, and speech-language impairments.\n\nDAMP is similar to minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), a concept that was formulated in the 1960s. Both concepts are related to certain psychiatric conditions, such as hyperactivity. The concept of MBD was strongly criticized by Sir Michael Rutter [Gillberg, 2003, p. 904] and several other researchers, and this led to its abandonment in the 1980s. At the same time, research showed that something similar was needed. One alternative concept was ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Gillberg proposed another alternative: DAMP. Gillberg's concept was formulated in the early 1980s, and the term itself was introduced in a paper that Gillberg published in 1986 (see Gillberg [1986]). (DAMP is essentially MBD without the etiological assumptions.)\n\nThe concept of DAMP met with considerable criticism. For example, Sir Michael Rutter stated that the concept of DAMP (unlike ADHD) was \"muddled\" and \"lacks both internal coherence and external discriminative validity ... it has no demonstrated treatment or prognostic implications\"; he concluded that the concept should be abandoned. Another example is the criticism of Per-Anders Rydelius, Professor of Child Psychiatry at the Karolinska Institute, who argued that the definition of DAMP was too vague: \"the borderline between DAMP and conduct disorders [is] unclear ... the borderline between DAMP and ADHD [is] unclear\"; he concluded that \"the concept is in need of revision\". And in 2000, Eva Kärfve, a sociologist at the University of Lund, published a book which argued that Gillberg's work on DAMP should be rejected.\n\nPerhaps the strongest criticism of DAMP is that Gillberg and his co-workers in Gothenburg are almost the only people doing research on DAMP. Indeed, in a review of DAMP published by Gillberg in 2003, it was noted that there were only \"about 50\" research papers that had been published on DAMP and that the \"vast majority of these have either originated in the author's own clinical and research setting or have been supervised and/or co-authored by him\" [Gillberg, 2003, p. 904]. This is in contrast to ADHD, on which \"several thousand papers\" had been published [Gillberg, 2003, p. 905]. As far as clinical practice goes, DAMP has been primarily accepted only in Gillberg's native Sweden and in Denmark [Gillberg, 2003, p. 904], and even in those countries acceptance is mixed.\n\nIn 2003, Gillberg revised his definition of DAMP. The new definition is as follows:\n\nStrong criticism of DAMP, however, has continued. In particular, it has been observed that \"the validity and utility of DAMP will remain unclear until stronger evidence of the special status of the overlap between its constituent disorders is provided\".\n\nIn 2005, there was an hour-long television program broadcast on Swedish TV, questioning why Sweden, almost alone in the world, would accept the DAMP construct. The program featured critical commentary from Sir Michael Rutter. It also considered some of the controversies over Gillberg's Gothenburg study.\n\nThe concept of DAMP (deficits in attention, motor control, and perception) has been in clinical use in Scandinavia for about 20 years. DAMP is diagnosed on the basis of concomitant attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and developmental coordination disorder in children who do not have severe learning disability or cerebral palsy. In clinically severe form it affects about 1.5% of the general population of 7 year old children; 3-6% are affected by more moderate variants. Boys are overrepresented; girls are currently probably underdiagnosed. There are many comorbid problems/overlapping conditions, including conduct disorder, depression/anxiety, and academic failure. There is a strong link with autism spectrum disorders in severe DAMP. Familial factors and pre- and perinatal risk factors account for much of the variance. Psychosocial risk factors appear to increase the risk of marked psychiatric abnormality in DAMP. Outcome in early adult age was psychosocially poor in one study in almost 60% of unmedicated cases. There are effective interventions available for many of the problems encountered in DAMP.\n\n\n"}

In September of that year, Charles La Trobe, Superintendent of the Port Phillip District and a keen amateur geologist, was examining marine deposits revealed by excavations associated with lime production in the area. A worker showed him two of a set of five keys he claimed to have found the day before, in a layer of shells down an excavation for a lime kiln, which was about from the shoreline. La Trobe was fascinated by the find and believed, from their appearance, that the keys were between 100 and 150 years old (~1700-1750 AD).\n\nSince the 1802 expedition of Matthew Flinders is the earliest proven European presence in the vicinity, writer Kenneth McIntyre has suggested the keys may have originated with some earlier European explorers of the region, possibly the Portuguese. McIntyre has connected the discovery of the Geelong Keys with the presence of the so-called Mahogany Ship, further west on Victoria's Shipwreck Coast, claiming that it could be another possible relic of early Portuguese exploration.\n\nThe editor of the Geelong Advertiser at the time, James Harrison, noted that metal objects were often embedded in new diggings to detect the leaching of payable metal. For instance, a copper oxide coating on the keys would suggest the presence of copper. Ronald Gunn, a friend of La Trobe, told the Royal Society of Victoria in September 1849 that he had gone to Geelong to investigate the discovery. On questioning the limeburner he found that the keys had not, in fact, been dug out of the shell layer but were found with shells at the bottom of the pit. It was only assumed that they had fallen from the upper layer. In practice they could have fallen from any layer, including the top of the excavation.\n\nThe keys were the subject of two pamphlets published by the Royal Society of Victoria in the 1870s. The first of these suggested that the depth at which the keys allegedly lay indicated an age closer to 200–300 years. The second pamphlet repudiated this claim and was based on an interview with a limeburner, who said that the keys may have been dropped down a hole to that depth. Research in the 1980s by geologist Edmund Gill, and engineer and historian Peter Alsop, showed the age of the deposit in which the keys were supposedly found was between 2330 and 2800 years. According to Gill and Alsop, La Trobe's error is quite understandable, given that in 1847 most people thought the earth was only 6000 years old.\n\nThe keys themselves, and all original drawings of them, have been lost. By the time they were shown to La Trobe, one had been lost by the limeburners' children and one had been given to a passer-by. La Trobe gave one to his friend Ronald Gunn and the other two went to the Melbourne Mechanic's Institute, from which they were lost after the institute went bankrupt. \n\nThe keys are referred to in the children's books \"The Voyage of the Poppykettle\" and \"The Unchosen Land\" by Robert Ingpen. In the stories, the keys are used as ballast in a clay-pot ship sailed by migrant Peruvian gnomes. The stories were so popular in Ingpen's hometown, Geelong, that a fountain and an annual Poppykettle Festival celebrate the mythical landing of the \"hairy Peruvians\".\n\n"}

He was tasked by the Nazi Party to oversee the purging of what the Nazi Party described as \"degenerate art\", by most of the German modern artists. He was Hitler's favourite painter.\n\nBorn to an architect father and a family of architects on his mother's side, Ziegler was always surrounded by artists. He studied at the Weimar Academy from 1910 under master of technique Max Doerner at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich. However, the First World War interrupted his studies when he signed up to become a front-line officer.\nAfter the war, he settled in Munich and continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich in 1919, where he attended classes by art nouveau artist Angelo Jank. He ultimately achieved the position of professor at the Munich Academy in 1933, when the Nazis came to power. His works fitted the Nazi ideal of \"racially pure\" art, and, as the President of the Reich Chamber for the Visual Arts, he was entrusted with the task of eliminating avant-garde styles. This he did by expelling Expressionist artists such as Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Writing to Rottluff, he forbade him from any artistic activity \"professional or amateur\".\n\nAlready a member of the Nazi Party in the early 1920s, he met Hitler in 1925 and became one of his advisors in artistic matters. Hitler commissioned Ziegler to paint a memoriam portrait of his niece, Geli Raubal, who had committed suicide. In 1937 he painted the \"Judgement of Paris\", which Hitler personally acquired some time later, hanging it in his residence at Munich—Hitler later also hung Ziegler's \"The Four Elements\" at a residence in Munich. It became an overnight sensation through frequent reproduction. This painting was much liked, judging by the enormous numbers of postcards and reproductions of it sold. The National Socialist celebrations of the human figure without conflict or suffering were immensely popular. By this time, Ziegler had become the foremost official painter of the Third Reich and was awarded the Golden Party Badge, in recognition for outstanding service to the Nazi Party or State.\n\nNot much is known about his early works except that his early style exhibited modernist forms. Exiled museum director noted in the late thirties that Ziegler was\n\nin former times a modern painter and a zealous admirer of the works of Franz Marc.…His transmutation proceeded by slow degrees.…before he took this position, he was one of the most extreme modern painters, but one of inferior rank.\n\nThere are no examples of such early works. He gave up the modern style for a representational and realistic style in the 1920s, during which time he had increased contact with Hitler. Ziegler exhibited eleven canvases at the Great German Art Exhibitions at the House of German Art between 1937 and 1943. A technically accomplished painter, Ziegler was known for mainly floral compositions, genre paintings, allegorical paintings inspired by Greek mythology, portraits, and numerous female nudes. His static, pseudo-classical nudes depicted ideal Aryan figures. In an interview with American playwright Barrie Stavis, Ziegler explained that a painting of a beautiful nude German woman encourages the ideal of a perfect body and gives German men the incentive to have many German children. However, the artistic ‘naturalism’ of the racially pure figures left nothing to the imagination, earning him the disparaging nickname of ‘Meister des Deutschen Schamhaares' (\"Master of German Pubic Hair\").\n\nZiegler occupied several important administrative positions during the Third Reich. He was appointed Senator of the Fine Arts at the Reich Chamber of Culture in 1935. Propaganda Minister Goebbels later appointed him to the Presidential Council, then vice-president of the Reich Chamber of Art. Finally, on December 1, 1936, he succeeded architect Eugen Hönig as president of the Chamber of Art, which then had 45,000 members. Ziegler's replacement of Hönig as president was a clear signal of the Reich's growing distaste for nonconformity in the arts.\n\nZiegler served as the president of the Prussian Academy of Arts in 1937.\n\nZiegler headed a five-man commission that toured state collections in numerous cities, hastily seizing works they deemed degenerate. The works were then rushed to Munich for installation in the narrow rooms of the Hofgarten arcade for display, including some 16,000 examples of expressionist, abstract, cubist and surrealist works of art. The paintings of such \"degenerate\" artists, including the works of Max Beckmann and Emil Nolde, were confiscated on Ziegler's orders as head of the sluice commission. Ziegler managed to organize the Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich in less than two weeks. On July 19, 1937, he opened the exhibition and condemned those museum directors from whose collections the works came and their tolerance of the decadent art. However, his name must not be confused with that of Hans Severus Ziegler, who organized in May 1938 the Entartete Musik or Degenerate music exhibition in Düsseldorf.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Ziegler was temporarily sent to a prison camp after he publicly expressed doubts about the viability of Hitler's campaign. When Hitler was notified of Ziegler's “defeatist” attitude, he ordered his arrest. Ziegler was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp for six weeks. However, Hitler personally ordered that he be released from Dachau and be allowed to retire.\n\nBecause his paintings were so closely associated with National Socialism, Ziegler was unable to successfully revive his career as an artist after the war. He repeatedly petitioned for reappointment to the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from 1955 to 1958, but was denied because the Academy determined that he initially received the position due to Hitler's personal appointment. There were some reports that Ziegler exhibited works in 1955 at the Ben Uri Gallery in London, but the gallery's records indicate the artist was an “Adolf Zeigler,” a Jewish painter from London, not the German Ziegler. He also wrote a response to Paul Ortwin Rave's first-hand accounts of the Entartete Kunst exhibition in Munich, arguing with Rave's assertions, but experts like Rave were not ready to analyze his standpoint objectively at that time. Unable to revive his career, Ziegler lived quietly in the village of Varnhalt near Baden-Baden for the last years of his life. He died in September 1959, at the age of sixty-seven.\n"}

The movie runs for 22 minutes, and is most famous for an opening sequence in which Keaton plays every role.\n\nThe film is set up as a series of humorous tricks on the audience, with constant doubling, and in which things are rarely what they at first seem to be. It opens with Keaton attending a variety show. In this first sequence, Keaton plays the conductor and every member of the orchestra, the actors, dancers, stagehands, minstrels, and every member of the audience, male and female. As an audience member, Keaton turns to the \"woman\" sitting beside him and remarks, \"This fellow Keaton seems to be the whole show.\" This was a gibe at one of Keaton's contemporaries, Thomas Ince, who credited himself generously in his film productions. In interviews with Kevin Brownlow, Keaton claims he gave the director's credit to Cline mainly because he did not want to appear too Ince-like himself: \"Having kidded things like that, I hesitated to put my own name on as a director and writer.\"\n\nThis elaborate trick-photography sequence turns out to be only a dream when Joe Roberts rouses Keaton from bed. The bedroom then turns out to be not a bedroom, but a set on a stage.\n\nThe second half of the film features Keaton's character falling for a girl who happens to be a twin. He has difficulty telling the twin who likes him from the one who does not. An uncredited Virginia Fox plays one of the twins. Edward F. Cline co-wrote the production and appears, uncredited, as a monkey trainer, whose monkey Keaton impersonates onstage after accidentally letting the animal escape.\n\n\nKeaton's portrayal of nine members of a minstrel show required the use of a special matte box in front of the camera lens. It had nine exactingly-machined strips of metal which could be moved up and down independently of each other. Elgin Lessley, Keaton's cameraman, shot the far-left Keaton with the first shutter up, and the others down. He then rewound the film, opened the second segment, and re-filmed the next Keaton in sequence. This procedure was repeated seven more times. The camera was hand-wound, so Lessley's hand had to be absolutely steady to avoid any variation in speed. Keaton synchronized his movements to the music of a banjo player who was playing along with a metronome -- not a problem in a silent film. It was decades before Keaton, who masterminded this, revealed his technique to other filmmakers.\n\n\n"}

He was returned to the Commons at a by-election in November 1843, for Kendal, but did not seek re-election in 1847.\n\nOn Parliament he was active in the reform of bankruptcy, the repeal of stamp duty on newspapers, introduction of the penny post and in the campaigns of the Anti-Corn Law League.\n\nThe son of John Warburton of Eltham, Kent, a timber merchant, he was educated at Eton College, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted 24 June 1802, aged 18. He was in the first class of the college examinations as freshman in 1803, and as junior soph in 1804. He was admitted scholar on 13 April 1804, graduated B.A. (being twelfth wrangler and placed next to Ralph Bernal) in 1806, and proceeded M.A. in 1812. George Pryme knew him in his undergraduate days, and both Bernal and Pryme were later his colleagues in politics.\n\nFor some years after leaving the university Warburton was engaged in the timber trade at Lambeth, but his taste for science and politics ultimately led to his abandoning commercial life. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 16 February 1809. William Hyde Wollaston was his closest friend, and in the autumn of 1818 they made a tour together on the continent. When Michael Faraday desired to become F.R.S., Warburton felt objections to his election, thinking that he had in one matter treated Wollaston unfairly. Correspondence ensued, and these objections were dispelled.\n\nWarburton was also a member of the Political Economy Club from its foundation in 1821 to his death, bringing before it on 13 January 1823 the question 'how far rents and profits are affected by tithes'. David Ricardo was one of his friends, and often mentions Warburton in his \"Letters to Malthus\". 'Philosopher Warburton,' as he was known, was one of the leading supporters of Henry Brougham in founding London University, and was a member of its first council in 1827.\n\nAt the general election of 1826 Warburton was returned to parliament in the Radical interest for the borough of Bridport in Dorset, making his first long speech on 30 November on foreign goods, and was re-elected in 1830, 1831, 1833, 1835, 1837, and 1841, all of the elections after the Reform Bill being strongly contested. On 8 September 1841 he resigned his seat for that constituency on the ground that a petition would have 'proved gross bribery against his colleague' in which his own agent would have been implicated. It subsequently came out that before the passing of the Reform Bill he himself had paid large sums of money improperly to certain of the electors. The question whether bribery had been practised at Bridport was referred to a select committee, but nothing resulted from its investigations. Warburton was out of the house until 9 November 1843, when he was returned for the borough of Kendal.\n\nIn the House of Commons he worked with Joseph Hume, and after 1832 found fresh colleagues in Charles Buller, George Grote, and Sir William Molesworth. The medical reformers selected him as their advocate. He brought forward on 20 June 1827, and Robert Peel supported, a motion for an inquiry into the funds and regulations of the College of Surgeons. He was chairman of the parliamentary committee on the study of anatomy, which began its sittings on 28 April 1828, and after one failure, through the action of the House of Lords, succeeded in 1832 in carrying an anatomy bill. A committee on the medical profession was appointed on 11 February 1834, and Warburton became its chairman. He examined Sir Astley Cooper, Sir Charles Bell, and many others; but the conclusions of the committee were not submitted to parliament.\n\nWarburton took an active part in 1831 in debates on bankruptcy. Early in 1833 he formed a project with Grote and John Arthur Roebuck for establishing a society for the diffusion of political and moral knowledge. He was intent in February 1835 on arranging a union of the Whigs under Lord John Russell with the followers of Daniel O'Connell; and it was he that sent to O'Connell a bundle of circulars from Russell, asking his friends to meet him at Lord Lichfield's house in St. James's Square, from which action resulted the Lichfield House compact. Warburton was for the repeal of the newspaper tax, and was active in the work of the Anti-Corn Law League. On the select committee of the House of Commons on postage in 1837 he strongly supported penny postage.\n\nAt the dissolution of 1847 he retired from political life, saying that the reforms which he had at heart had been made. He died at 45 Cadogan Place, London, on 16 September 1858, aged 73.\n\n"}

Each time it takes place, it draws protests from campaigners, politicians and civil society – particularly as many of the regimes invited to buy arms are also accused of human-rights abuses and breaching international humanitarian law.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1991, the British Army Equipment Exhibition and the Royal Navy Equipment Exhibition were held on alternate years in Aldershot and Portsmouth respectively. Overseas delegations attended by invitation only. Despite having been at war with Iran for almost six years, a five-strong delegation from Iraq attended in 1986.\n\nIn 1993 the two exhibitions were combined and held every other year until the British government decided to privatise the exhibition. Exhibitions company Spearhead launched the first DSEI, then known as Defence and \"Systems\" Equipment International, in 1999 at Chertsey in Surrey. In 2001 it moved to its current location at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London Docklands. DSEI's name was changed in 2009, replacing the word \"Systems\" with \"Security\".\n\nIn April 2008, DSEI was acquired by Clarion Events. At the same time Clarion also acquired ITEC - a conference and exhibition dedicated to military simulation, training and education - and Latin American Aerospace and Defence. Clarion's organising of DSEI has made it a target of protests. In July 2017, anti-war campaigners wrote 'war starts here' outside the company's office.\n\nIt was suggested by CAAT (Campaign Against Arms Trade) that former owners Reed Exhibitions' decision to sell followed substantial criticism both from healthcare professionals and academics, as well as criticism from campaigners, over the alleged immoral nature of the arms fair.\n\nDSEI works closely with the Department of International Trade's arms-export promotion arm (DIT DSO) to invite foreign military delegations. Some of these delegations are accused of being undemocratic and abusing human-rights. In 2015, 61 countries were invited to DSEI. Of these, 14 were characterised by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index of having authoritarian regimes. Four (Colombia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan) were also on the UK government's list of countries with wide-ranging human rights concerns. Six countries were characterised by the Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research as being \"at war\" at the time.\n\nCriticism of the DSEI arms fair has been led by Campaign Against Arms Trade but other NGOs such as Amnesty International have also criticised the fair - focusing on the presence of human-rights abusing regimes and on the sale of illegal torture equipment. In 2015, Amnesty International criticised the organiser's decision to bar human-rights researcher Oliver Sprague from the arms fair. Amnesty said it suspected \"organisers wished to prevent human rights experts from detecting the presence of any illegal activity at the event, which has a chequered history\".\n\nAlthough the government has supported the event since its inception, opposition politicians have criticised it. In 2017, London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for it to be banned. He said: “The Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) arms fair is not an event that I support. ExCeL is a commercial space for hire. I am opposed to London being used as a market place for the trade of weapons to those countries that contribute to human rights abuses.”. On the other hand, when Boris Johnson was Mayor of London, he said the arms fair should take place.\n\nPolling of 2,000 UK adults, conducted by Opinium in 2015, showed that 43% believed that the government should not be involved in organising arms fairs like DSEI, with 19% believing that they should. When asked if the government should be involved in organising arms fairs which human rights abusers are invited to, 64% said 'no' and 9% said 'yes'.\n\nAt several DSEI arms fairs, organisers have faced criticism after torture equipment was found for sale at the fair. In 2015, two arms companies exhibiting at the fair (Tianjin Myway and Magforce International) advertised leg irons and electric batons. In 2007, another Chinese company called Famous Glory was found to be advertising banned leg irons in its brochure. In 2011, Amnesty International claimed that illegal torture equipment was again on display.\n\nThe event has attracted much attention from activist groups. In 2001, 2003, and 2005 were all targets of sizeable protests. Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone has been critical of the event and even the Metropolitan Police have spoken out about the cost of policing the event. In 2013 the London Mayor Boris Johnson supported the exhibition, which caused controversy with activists.\n\nProtestors targeted DSEI exhibitor Lockheed Martin by blocking the entrances to their Regent Street office. A networking dinner for DSEI attendees was also targeted by protesters who sat outside of the Troxy venue holding a banner which said: \"Arms dealers here today - this is not OK!\".\n\nDuring protests against the DSEI arms fair in 2015, eight people were arrested for blocking a road which led to the Excel Centre in order to stop tanks and armoured vehicles getting to the fair. The Crown Prosecution Service charged them with blocking a highway but the judge ruled that, by attempting to disrupt the arms fair, the protesters had been trying to prevent greater crimes such as genocide and torture. Defence witnesses in the case argued that the arms fair facilitated the repressive government of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia’s bombing campaign in Yemen and Turkey’s internal repression of its Kurdish population. District judge Angus Hamilton said: \"“[There is] clear, credible and largely unchallenged evidence from the expert witnesses of wrongdoing at DSEI and compelling evidence that it took place in 2015. It was not appropriately investigated by the authorities. This could be inferred from the responses of the police officers, that they did not take the defendants’ allegations seriously.”\n\nCampaigners disrupted the event by blockading entrances to the centre.

Born near Albany, New York, Steele was raised in Oswego. After reading law in the office of Grant and Allen, he was admitted to the New York bar in 1840. He moved west in 1841, practicing law in both Illinois and Wisconsin. Steele was a member of the first Wisconsin constitutional convention of 1846, and briefly served in the Wisconsin State Senate.\n\nIn 1850, Steele traveled to California, prospecting at Shasta, Scott River, Greenhorn and Yreka, among other claims. Before returning to the practice of law on a permanent basis during the mid-1850s, he engaged in a variety of occupations, including express company operator and driver, butcher and rancher. As a Republican Party leader, Steele campaigned actively for Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and was himself elected to the California State Assembly in 1867, where he served as chairman of the judiciary committee. Steele was elected a Superior Court judge for Siskiyou County in 1879 and held the office until his death. In 1865, he was the founder of the Siskiyou County Agricultural Society and served as its first president. During the early 1860s Steele was Agent of Indian Affairs for the Northern District of California, in which office he secured a treaty (known as the Valentine's Day Treaty) with the Modoc Indians which may well have averted the later Modoc War, had the treaty been ratified. During the war with the Modocs (1872–1873), Steele worked tirelessly to secure both peace and justice for the tribe, drawing accusations and recriminations, particularly from Oregon settlers who sought the executions of Modoc raiders.\n\nSteele was married three times, to Lucia Hart (1843–1853), to Louisa B. Hamblin (1858–1866) and to Louisa Lanze (1875–1883). Steele's first name is frequently erroneously reported as Elisha. This is due to an original misreading or misrecording of an early California voter list. This error first received wide circulation in Keith A. Murray's groundbreaking, \"The Modocs and Their War\" in 1959 and it has often been repeated. Steele's grave marker, in Yreka, California's Evergreen Cemetery, clarifies this discrepancy, as does his obituary in the \"Yreka Journal\" of June 30, 1883.\n"}

The estimated population in 2015 was 2,190. \n\nLeyburn was mentioned in the Domesday Book but had no recorded population, the growth of Leyburn as a major hub is linked to the decline in fortunes of nearby Wensley, which had prominence as the only market town in Wensleydale until being devestated by the plague in 1563, leaving what was once an important and prosperous town, mostly abandonded. Leyburn's stature increased in the 17th century when a market charter was granted by Charles II in 1686. A new town hall was built in 1856 by Lord Bolton, which now houses several shops.

After studying with tutors and at Faenza, in 1750 he entered the Collegio Bandinelli in Rome, founded for the education of young Tuscans. His father having died that year, Piero Francesco Foggini took an interest in the young man's education. Fabroni became a priest.\n\nOn the conclusion of his studies he continued his stay in Rome, and having been introduced to the celebrated Jansenist historian, Giovanni Gaetano Bottari, the librarian of the Corsini, he translated some meditative works of Pasquier Quesnel and received from Bottari a canonry at Santa Teresa in Trastevere. With Bottari's aid he presented a polished Latin life of Pope Clement XII Corsini, for which Cardinal Corsini defrayed the printing costs and made a handsome present to its author. Some time after this Fabroni was chosen to preach a Latin discourse in the pontifical chapel before Benedict XIV, with whom he made such a favorable impression that the pontiff settled on him an annuity, in the possession of which Fabroni was able to devote his whole time to study. Fabroni was asked to deliver the funeral oration in 1766 for James Stuart, the \"Old Pretender\" to the throne of Great Britain. He was intimate with Leopold Peter, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who appointed him prior of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence (1767); two years later, Fabroni took leave to pursue promises of preferment at Rome, made by Pope Clement XIV Ganganelli, in which he was disappointed.\n\nHe was at work on the biographical dictionary of Italian men of letters for which he is remembered; the first volume was published in 1766, and was met with criticism, for the Jesuits disliked him on account of his Jansenist views. Besides his other literary labors he began at Pisa in 1771 a literary journal, \"Giornale de' letterati\", which he continued till 1796, by which time 102 fascicles had appeared, many from his own pen. About 1772, funded by the Grand Duke, he made a journey to Paris, where he formed the acquaintance of Condorcet, Diderot, d'Alembert, Rousseau and most of the other \"Encyclopédistes\"whom he found to be leaders of impietyand other eminent Frenchmen of the day. He also spent four months in London, of which he also disapproved, where Benjamin Franklin fruitlessly urged him to go to America. He returned to Tuscany in 1773. Later he corresponded with Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. He died in retirement among the Carthusians at Pisa.\n\nHis principal works were: \"Vitae Italorum doctrina excellentium qui in saeculis XVII. et XVIII. floruerunt\" (20 vols., Pisa, 1778-1799, 1804-1805); \"Laurentii Medicei Magnifici Vita\" (2 vols., Pisa, 1784), which served as a basis for William Roscoe's \"Life of Lorenzo de' Medici\"; \"Leonis X pontificis maximi Vita\" (Pisa, 1797); and \"Elogi di Dante Alighieri, di Angelo Poliziano, di Lodovico Ariosto, e di Torquato Tasso\" (Parma, 1800).\n"}
{"id": "2219230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219230", "title": "Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians", "text": "Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians\n\nThe Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians (Ojibwe language: Mikinaakwajiw-ininiwag) is a Native American tribe of Ojibwa and Métis peoples, based on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota. The tribe has 30,000 enrolled members. A population of 5,815 reside on the main reservation and another 2,516 reside on off-reservation trust land (as of the 2000 census). It is federally recognized and Jamie Azure is the current Tribal Chairman elected for 2016 to 2018 term.\n\nAround the end of the eighteenth century, prior to the advent of white traders in the area, the formerly woodland-oriented Chippewa, who had been in what is now Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, moved out onto the Great Plains in pursuit of the bison and new beaver resources to hunt and trade. They successfully reoriented their culture to life on the plains, adopting horses, and developing the bison-hide tipi, the Red River cart, hard-soled footwear, and new ceremonial procedures. By around 1800, these Indians were hunting in the Turtle Mountain area of present-day North Dakota.\n\nFor more than a century, as there was no international boundary, the Chippewa freely ranged in the areas that would become Manitoba, Canada and the United States including Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana, where they mingled with Cree and other tribes in the area. Running battles with the Dakota over territorial disputes, were finally settled in 1858 with the signing of the Sweet Corn Treaty which described the 11,000,000 acres of the Chippewa domain and provided for reparations. The agreement was signed by Mattonwakan, Chief of the Yanktons and La Terre Qui Purle, Chief of the Sisseton Band, Chief Wilkie (Narbexxa) of the Chippewa and witnessed by many members of both tribes.\n\nBy 1863, the Chippewa domain encompassed nearly one-third of the land in what would become North Dakota. White settlers, wanting to take advantage of the Homestead Act petitioned Congress to open up the Red River valley for agriculture and to make treaties with the native peoples. On 2 October 1863, at the Old Crossing of the Red Lake River in Minnesota, Red Lake chiefs Monsomo (Moose Dung), Kaw-was-ke-ne-kay (Broken Arm), May-dwa-gum-on-ind (He That Is Spoken To) and Leading Feather, along with chiefs of the Pembina Band, Ase-anse (Little Shell II) and Miscomukquah (Red Bear) met with Alexander Ramsey and Ashley C. Morrill, commissioners for the Government, to negotiate. The government secured all 11-million acres obtained in the Sweet Corn Treaty to open it up to settlement. The Chippewa signed the treaty under duress.\n\nThe 1869–1870 Red River Rebellion was a series of events that started when the Hudson's Bay Company transferred the North-Western Territory trapping franchise to Canada. As a result, Louis Riel and his Métis followers seized Fort Garry on 2 November 1869, and attempted to establish a provisional government for the territory of Manitoba. When Canadian troops arrived, Riel fled to the sanctuary of Montana, married, and became a US Citizen. In 1885, a group of Métis from Prince Albert, Canada asked for his assistance in settling grievances between the Métis and settlers. Riel drafted a petition, but fighting broke out, and he became wanted. Riel surrendered and was tried for treason. He was found guilty and hanged causing his followers to flee and seek refuge with the Turtle Mountain Chippewa.\n\nAs the fur trade and buffalo hunting diminished available resources, the landless Turtle Mountain Chippewas, though recognized by the Government, found it difficult to ward off starvation. In an effort to provide them with a reservation, Congress approved purchase on 3 March 1873, of lands on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota and attempted to relocate the tribe. The Chippewa refused to move and insisted on remaining in the Turtle Mountains. In June, 1884, an agreement had set aside a reservation twelve miles by six miles which was being occupied by the Turtle Mountain Band, but by 1891, again the US wanted a land cession.\n\nIn 1891, Agent Waugh of Fort Totten, convened a committee of 16 full bloods and 16 mixed bloods to take a census of the Chippewa and set boundaries for a new reservation. Little Shell III wanted to obtain a 30 square mile tract at Turtle Mountain, but when that proposal was rejected, he and his followers abandoned the meeting. The McCumber Agreement was reached on 22 October 1892, which granted two townships within the traditional area ceding all other lands the Chippewa might possess in North Dakota. The land granted was inadequate to meet the needs of granting allotments to all tribal members, so negotiations continued. Finally in 1904, Article VI was added which provided that \"All members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewas who may be unable to secure land upon the reservation above ceded may take homesteads upon any vacant land belonging to the United States without charge, and shall continue to hold and be entitled to such share in all tribal funds, annuities, or other property, the same as if located on the reservations.\" With this provision, the Chippewa agreed to the terms and the final agreement was ratified by Congress on 21 April 1904.\n\nIn the decades after signing the McCumber agreement and the Great Depression the Chippewa adopted farming and gardening as a way of survival. They developed a Big Store in 1922 to sell goods and operated a creamery. They sold farm goods, chopped lumber, farm labor and medicinal herbs. Under the WPA, men gained training in construction jobs and women learned to sew and can goods. Congress approved the first charter of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa in 1932 and because of their successful endeavors and distrust of government programs, the tribe chose not to participate in the Indian Reorganization Act.\n\nThe tribe filed numerous claims for a below market value settlement on the lands ceded in the McCumber Agreement. In 1934, Congress passed a law for the Indian Court of Claims to determine a settlement with the Chippewa, but it was vetoed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in May, 1934. As second attempt was also vetoed in June, 1934. Finally in 1946, with the establishment of the Indian Claims Commission, the tribe filed a petition in 1948. On 9 June 1964 an Act established their claim and a method of distribution of the judgment.\n\nOn 1 August 1953, the US Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 108 which called for the immediate termination of the Flathead, Klamath, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Turtle Mountain Chippewa, as well as all tribes in the states of California, New York, Florida, and Texas. Termination of a tribe meant the immediate withdrawal of all federal aid, services, and protection, as well as the end of reservations. Though termination legislation was introduced (Legislation 4. S. 2748, H.R. 7316. 83rd Congress. Termination of Federal Supervision over Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians), the law was not implemented. In 1954, at the Congressional hearings for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, tribal Chairman Patrick Gourneau and a delegation spoke in Washington, DC. They testified that the group was not financially prepared, had high unemployment and poverty, suffered from low education levels, and termination would be devastating to the tribe. Based on their testimony, the Chippewa were dropped from the tribes to be terminated.\n\nAs the fur trade dwindled, many of the bands from the Red, Rainy, Leech and Sandy Lakes areas who had settled near the Post, drifted back into Minnesota and North Dakota. One band, the Mikinak-wastsha-anishinabe, established their community in the Turtle Mountains. An 1849 letter from a Canadian priest, Father Belcourt, described the people of the Pembina Territory in 1849 as being from Red Lake, Reed Lake, Pembina and Turtle Mountain bands mixed with Métis, who far outnumbered the Chippewa. ()\n\nA court case in 2003 ruled that the Little Shell Band of Chippewa Indians (of Montana) is a separate tribe, given the Little Shell Band's independent development since the 1890s and its relocation to Montana to have a separate government. The courts have recognized three independent units claiming the name Chippewa, and several unassociated members of that band. This case refers to cases of the Indian Claims Commission and United States Court of Claims, which can no longer be found online at their original sources, as the cases are old.\n\nThe Turtle Mountain Chippewa became the first tribe in the United States to ban hydraulic fracturing (fracking) on November 22, 2011, by unanimous vote for a tribal resolution drafted by the grassroots tribal member group No Fracking Way Turtle Mountain Tribe. The tribal resolution fracking ban was amended by the tribal council to direct the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to cancel oil and gas bids on 45,000 acres of tribal land that was scheduled to begin on December 14, 2011. The BIA cancelled the bids on December 9, 2011.\n\nThe tribe has founded the Turtle Mountain Community College, one of numerous tribally controlled colleges in the United States.\n\nThe tribe has established online, short-term installment loans as a business to serve underbanked Americans. The business has brought new employment opportunities and has generated financial support for other tribal business ventures and social programs for the reservation. The tribe established BlueChip Financial in 2012, which is based on the reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota and employs more than two dozen enrolled tribal members. BlueChip Financial is doing business under the Spotloan.com brand. The loans are only available online and the maximum loan value is $800, according to the company website. Since launch, the company has made 250,000 loans and operates only in the United States excluding selected states, as per listed on the website.\n\nOther tribes participating in online short-term lending include the Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake, the Otoe-Missouria Tribe, the Chippewa Cree Tribe, the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, the Fort Belknap Indian Community in Montana, and the Santee Sioux Nation of Nebraska. The Native American Financial Services Association (NAFSA) cites “Tribal online lending provides a critical economic lifeline for sovereign tribes in remote areas, whether or not they engage in tribal government gaming. While many out-of-the-way tribal communities have developed gaming facilities as a way to create jobs and generate essential government revenues, remote reservations and gaming properties have been more severely impacted by the economic downturn.\"\n\nThere is high unemployment and poverty rates within the tribes and according to U.S. News & World Report and Pew Research “more than 1 in 4 native people live in poverty and labor force participation rate – which measures the share of adults either working or looking for a job – is 61.6 percent, the lowest for all race and ethnicity groups.”\n\nDelvin Cree, a writer with \"The Tribal Independent,\" criticized tribal lending in an opinion piece published on Indianz.com in February 2012. On the other hand, \"The Wall Street Journal\" and other publications have written about how tribal online lending programs have brought much-needed economic development to tribes without many other economic development opportunities.\n\nChairperson Sherry Treppa of the Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake testified before the House Committee on Financial Services regarding tribal online small dollar lending programs becoming a vital part of many tribes’ economic development strategies, providing much-needed jobs and revenue. She also argued that attempts to regulate tribes engaging in online lending is an attack on state and tribal sovereignty.\n\nIn addressing tribal sovereignty and the relationship with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Saba Bazzazieh argues that “the bureau has disregarded tribal sovereignty since its creation, the problem has recently reached an all-time high.” Additionally, “the bureau has demonstrated a patent misunderstanding of what tribal sovereignty actually means in practice, including the fundamentally important issue of preemption of state law.”\n\nIn 2016, Gavin Clarkson authored an important analysis on the law and economics of tribal online lending programs, finding that the programs were lawful, called “Online Sovereignty: The Law and Economics of Tribal Electronic Commerce.” In this analysis Clarkson also identified ways in which lending has supported the tribal economy to include employment, infrastructure, education, healthcare, tribal services and social services. He notes that “many tribes participating in tribal lending have few other options in the wake of federal funding shortfalls and shrinking tribal budgets.”\n\n\n\n\n"}

They run from the outer edges of a top downwards and inwards to a point on the mast or lower shrouds, and carry the load of the shrouds that rise from the edge of the top. This prevents any tendency of the top itself to tilt relative to the mast. \n\nIn the most traditional ships, the futtock shrouds can be used to gain access to the tops. Sailors ascend ratlines on the ordinary shrouds until nearly at the top, then transfer to the futtock shrouds which will be reaching upwards and outwards above them. Using the futtock shrouds involves climbing the underside of an overhanging rope at about 45 degrees. Futtock shrouds may or may not have ratlines.\n\nAs well as climbing the futtock shrouds, most ships also allowed access to the top through the \"lubber's hole\" at the tip of the ordinary ratlines. However, this was generally scorned by experienced sailors, and reserved for those on their first few trips aloft.\n\nAny traditionally-rigged ship will have futtock shrouds, but on some modern ones they are strictly for structural purposes, with climbing forbidden. These ships may also dispense with lubbers' holes, and instead opt for a \"Jacob's ladder\" that descends from the edge of the top to the ratlines vertically, rather than overhanging like the futtock shrouds.\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century the futtock band was introduced, being a metal collar fitted to the mast below the top, to which the lower point of the futtock shrouds is attached. Before this the futtock shrouds were attached to the lower shrouds that rose directly to the top. In this arrangement lower shrouds must support a greater load, requiring the use of catharpins to provide bracing between port and starboard shrouds.\n\nIn the construction of a wooden-hulled ship, the futtocks are the separate pieces of timber which compose the frame of the ship. There are four futtocks (component parts of the rib), and occasionally five, to a ship. Those next to the keel are called 'ground-futtocks', or navel-futtocks, and the rest are termed 'upper futtocks'. The word itself is derived from a contraction of 'foot hook', indicating their role in providing a secure framework to a ship.\n\n"}

ARTEMIS is considered the first military operation led by the EU, the first autonomous EU operation, the first rapid response mission of the EU, first operation outside Europe, first operation applying the principle of the framework nation and first example of \"relay operation\", conducted in cooperation between the EU and the United Nations. The deployment of EUFOR troops quickly decreased the conflict's intensity. It marked the first autonomous EU military mission outside Europe and an important milestone in development of the European Security and Defence Policy.\n\nDuring the Second Congo War, the Ituri conflict occurred in the Ituri Region alongside Lake Albert and the Ugandan border. The Ituri conflict was fought between two non-governmental informally organised ethnic groups, the Lendu and Hema, that had caused the deaths of thousands of people by 2003.\n\nIn 2003, Lendu and Hema militias were battling for control of the town after Ugandan troops withdrew after the signing of a peace agreement, and Congolese police fled. During discussions regarding the deployment of an international force, UN Security Council diplomats were mindful of a repetition of the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Following a series of massacres, including the Bogoro attack of February 2003, and reports by the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) of serious human rights abuses, the Security Council adopted the Resolution 1484 on 30 May 2003 and authorised the deployment of a French led Interim Multinational Emergency Force (IMEF) to the regional capital of Bunia.\n\nIn the beginning of 2003, the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) observer teams present in that country since 1999, monitored serious combats and human rights violations in Ituri province where the Ituri conflict had been unfolding for the previous four years.\n\nThe withdrawal of 7,000 Ugandan troops in April 2003 led to a deteriorating security situation in the Ituri region, endangering the peace process in DRC. In April 2003, 800 Ugandan soldiers were deployed in Bunia and one observer died in a mine explosion. In May 2003, two military observers were killed by a militia.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for establishing and deploying a temporary multi-national force to the area until the weakened MONUC mission could be reinforced. On 30 May 2003, the Security Council adopted the Resolution 1484 authorising the deployment of an Interim Multinational Emergency Force (IMEF) to Bunia with a task to secure the airport, protect internally displaced persons in camps and the civilians in the town.\n\nThe French Government had already shown interest in leading the operation. It soon broadened to an EU-led mission with France as the \"Lead nation\" providing the bulk of the personnel (900 of the 1400 troops) and complemented by contributions from both EU and non-EU nations. The force was supported by French aircraft based at N'Djamena and Entebbe airfields. A small Swedish Special Forces group (SSG and FJS) was also added.\n\n\nOperation Artemis was launched on 12 June and the IMEF completed its deployment in the following three weeks. The force was successful in stabilising the situation in Bunia and enforcing the UN presence in the DRC. On 1 September 2003, responsibility for the security of the region was handed over to the MONUC mission. The number of authorised personnel in the MONUC mission was previously extended in Resolution 1493.\n\nFollowing the rapid deployment of about 1800 troops to the region in June 2003, Bunia was secured but massacres continued in the countryside. On 1 September 2003, responsibility for the security of the region was handed over to the MONUC mission.\n\nBy December 2003, one of major warring parties in the region, the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) had split and fighting in the region decreased significantly. Artemis was the first autonomous EU military mission outside Europe - an important milestone in development of the European Security and Defence Policy.\n\n\n"}

The brand is produced at the Stevens Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin.\n\nThe brewery was founded by Minneapolis attorney James Page in 1986. It was located on Quincy Street in Northeast Minneapolis, in an aging industrial warehouse building. The brewery's infrastructure was cobbled together from secondhand equipment. Page never exceeded more than about 1500 barrels per year of production until it was sold to new owners in the mid 1990s.\n\nIn addition to operating a brewery, James Page was also a home brewing retailer. It operated a retail store out of the company's tap room and had a mail order shipping/catalog operation.\n\nIn October 1995, James Page sold the brewery to a group of investors with a background in food marketing. Page continued to operate a home brew supply company until 1998 under the name \"James Page Brewing\", although there was no longer any tie to the brewery.\n\nThe new owners of the brewery, led by President David Anderson, thoroughly re-invented the brand. They created a fictional character to personify \"James Page\", who bore little resemblance to the founder of the company; he was a rugged American frontiersman. They also stopped the practice of trucking the beer to distant bottling lines. Instead, they produced the bottled product as a contract brew at regional breweries (Minnesota Brewing Company in St. Paul, and then Stroh's in St. Paul). The draught product continued to be brewed at the Quincy Street brewery.\n\nIn 1998, Page became one of the first American craft breweries to package its beer in cans. The canned product was brewed and packaged under contract at the August Schell Brewing Company in New Ulm, Minnesota. It won a contract with Northwest Airlines to feature the canned beer on certain domestic flights.\n\nDespite a more aggressive marketing push, the brewery's new management was not able to turn a profit. The James Page Brewing Company suffered from an identity crisis: although the Quincy Street brewery produced beer for its draught accounts, the bottled product was a contract brew. The beer in the bottles was not the same product as the beer in the kegs, and this did not help its reputation among beer aficionados. As a result, Page management made the acquisition of a bottling line a top priority during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIn 2000, James Page had a stock offering, and the first $400,000 was specifically earmarked for the bottling line. It advertised the stock offering on six-packs, soliciting investments as small as $285. The company announced that it had successfully raised the maximum $855,000 from over 1,000 investors in January, 2000. But the money was never used to fund expansion; instead it was used to lower the company's debt burdens, and the bottling line was never built. In 2002, the brewery was shut down. The company continued to contract-brew beer at other regional breweries.\n\nIn 2005, the company's final asset was liquidated when the Page brand name was purchased by the Stevens Point Brewery in Steven's Point, Wisconsin.\n\nJames Page's most popular beers in the early period included Private Stock (an amber lager), Boundary Waters Lager (possibly the first commercially-produced beer made with wild rice), Boundary Waters Bock, Burly Brown Ale, and Mill City Wheat. James Page Private Stock and Boundary Waters Lager were available in six-packs year-round.\n\n"}

The word \"sissi\", first attested in the modern meaning \"patrolman, partisan, spy\" in 1787, comes to Finnish from Slavic and refers either to a forest bandit or his yew bow.\n\nThe Finnish Army trained Sissi units to conduct long range reconnaissance patrols, gather intelligence from concealed observation posts, raid enemy installations (especially supply depots), conduct road side ambushes and pursue and destroy enemy special forces units.\n\nIn wartime, an unspecified number of reservists were to be assigned to Sissi battalions and would deploy and operate as small groups up to company size. They were meant to stay behind and covertly operate against enemy forces in their area of responsibility even if regular friendly troops had been forced to retreat. Sissi battalions were part of Finnish Army local troops, unlike the jäger and armored brigades meant for operational use.\n\nIn official Finnish military parlance, the word \"sissi\" has been largely phased out. For example, the Sissi company of the Lappi Border Guard of the Finnish Border Guard was renamed to \"Border Jaeger Company\" in 1994. The conscripts serving in the unit were concurrently renamed to Border Jaegers. Similarly, Finnish Army sissi units are now called \"reconnaissance\" units, and the personnel serving in them called \"tiedustelija\", \"reconnaissance man\". A notable exception are the \"sissiradisti\" or Sissi signalists.\n\nWars between Russia and Finland have a long tradition of Finnish sissi warfare. Famous sissi leaders have included Pekka Vesainen (c. 1540–1627), Tapani Löfving (1689–1777, fought during the Greater Wrath), and Olli Tiainen (1770–1833, fought during the Finnish War).\n\nBefore the hostilities of Winter War, the Finnish Borderguard formed 25 Independent Battalions (Erillinen Pataljoona) from local reservists along the border area. After the outbreak of hostilities, a further five Sissi Battalions (Sissipataljoona) were formed from \"auxiliary personnel\". These battalions especially those of the latter type, were below their nominal strength in both men and weaponry. These units proved to be effective in using motti tactics in their native area with light infantry weapons and skis.\n\nIn the Continuation War the \"ad hoc\" Sissi Battalions were discontinued, but Independent Battalions were raised, 4th Independent Battalion was directly under the command of Supreme Headquarters doing LRRP and raiding missions deep inside Soviet area. In the Battle of Ilomantsi, soldiers of the 4th disrupted the supply lines of the Soviet artillery, preventing effective fire support. In the Ladoga Karelia front the length of the front, absence of roads and lack of troops prevented continuous front lines during the trench warfare period. Both armies used a chain of fortified field bases separated by the wilderness, monitoring and controlling the gaps with patrols. Both Finns and Soviets launched raids and recon patrols into enemy territory. Battles were short clashes of lightly armed infantry groups from squadron to battalion in size, with little chance of support or reinforcements.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Sissi units were decommissioned and officially Sissi training was discontinued, although many units gave Sissi training for their reconnaissance units. In the beginning of the 1960s, Paratrooper School was established at Utti, infantry and border guard established Sissi training companies thereafter.\n\n\nIn Finnish, \"\"sissi\"\" means guerrilla, but the term is somewhat misleading when referring to Finnish Defence Force Sissi troops. Sissi forces are not irregular guerrilla or militia forces; they are part of the regular FDF troops trained for operations behind enemy lines. Like most of the Finnish Defence Forces, Sissi battalions are composed of reservists. Their closest foreign equivalents are the Swedish Armed Forces \"Jägare\" troops.\n\nSissi as a description is a person of extraordinary stamina (or Sisu) – e.g. \"Sissi weather\" (Sissin sää) refers to the worst possible weather conditions, for sissi soldiers prefer these for their operations, since bad weather tends to distract enemy soldiers (any normal soldier tends to think about getting to shelter as soon as possible when bad weather strikes) and hide any noise caused by sissis.\n\nDespite the phasing out of the term in official use, in Finnish military slang \"sissi\" continues to be used as an umbrella term for all unconventional military applications, such as MREs, which are called \"Sissi rations\", also any improvised and/or temporary repair to any equipment is often called \"sissiviritys\", literally \"sissi fix\" or \"sissi patch\", in addition any improvised booby-trap, such as a firearm rigged to fire at doorway of a building once someone opens the door, may be called \"sissijäynä\", literally \"sissi prank\".\n\nThe training of the Sissi troops was not centralized, but they were historically trained in several Finnish Defence Force brigades as well as in the Sissi companies of the Finnish Border Guard. Reserve officers for all Sissi troops were trained at Reserviupseerikoulu.\n\nThe Sissi conscripts were given training in survival, signals and demolitions, extended small arms training as well as training in advanced escape & evasion techniques and ambush tactics. Those unable to cope for either physical or psychological reasons were either given deferments or transferred to a regular infantry training. \n\nSissi troops were un-motorized and are not equipped with heavy weapons or equipment, their uniforms and weaponry almost identical to the regular infantry issued. Distinctive personal equipment used by Sissi were Savotta \"Para Jäger\" backpacks used because of extended hikes, camouflage paint and personal camouflage nets. Sissi units had fewer crew served weapons and more sniper rifles than regular infantry.\n\nMines were an important part of the Sissi tactic of ambushing enemy convoys. They were also used to discourage pursuit after a raid and serve as defences of bivouac. Sissi training included constructing improvised explosive devices, as well as boobytraps (e.g. from dud artillery shells). Sissi units had a wide variety of land mines at their disposal, including:\n\n\nThe Finnish Defence Forces no longer has any sissi companies as part of its peace time training organization. The last sissi company was renamed to a reconnaissance company in 2015 and disbanded completely in 2016.\n\nThe status of sissi troops as part of the wartime FDF is less clear, as there is little available public information. The National Defense University of Finland hasn't published any thesis or paper on the 21st century where sissi units and tactics are mentioned. The FDF's reformed land warfare doctrine is a distributed fighting doctrine which requires every soldier in the army to understand basic principles of asymmetric tactics. FDF continues to provide reconnaissance (formerly sissi) training in many major training formations, where they emphasize reconnaissance, forward observation and fire control but this training no longer leans towards special tactics, weapons, sabotage and woodland area fighting skills. However, the FDF paratroopers trained in the Utti Jaeger Regiment are trained in woodland area fighting, survival skills, unconventional methods and asymmetric tactics though the major role is geared more towards long range reconnaissance and special operations.\nFinnish Border Guard, under the ministry of interior, has renamed its Sissi companies to Border Jaeger companies and has adopted the term (Special) Border Jaeger as a replacement for the term Sissi. These are trained to operate behind the enemy lines with asymmetric tactics and unconventional weapons and methods as well as do long term operational reconnaissance and aggressive short term reconnaissance and sabotage. Aside from classical Sissi training, the training also includes peacetime operational methods and the responsibilities of the Border Guard i.e. border control, patrol and tracking and catching illegal intruders.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2219281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219281", "title": "Mirage (Magic: The Gathering)", "text": "Mirage (Magic: The Gathering)\n\nMirage was the first official block structure in \"\". This new block structure consisted of three expansion sets and would continue for nearly two decades, finally ending with Khans of Tarkir in 2014. The new block structure also set up the precedent that the first set in the block also became the name for the entire block. Mirage block consisted of three sets: \"Mirage\", \"Visions\" and \"Weatherlight\".\n\nThe story concerns three of the most powerful nations of Jamuraa (a tropical continent modeled after Africa) — the militaristic kingdom of the Zhalfirins, the religious state of Femeref, and the trading province of the Suq'Ata empire. Zhalfir was the warrior nation, based mainly on red. Femeref was mainly white, and featured clerics and healers, while the seafaring traders of Suq'Ata were mostly blue. Mirage concerned these three nations and their struggle against the evil wizard Kaervek. Kaervek has imprisoned the powerful wizard and diplomat Mangara in an amber prison and the bulk of the story details the Jamuraans attempting to free Mangara. In addition to these events the planeswalker Teferi has caused his island to disappear from existence for almost 200 years. It is the phasing of the entire island that led Kaervek and Mangara to Jamuraa in the first place.\n\nBy the time of \"Visions\", Femeref has been destroyed and Suq'Ata and Zhalfir begin to have internal problems as well. There is hope, however, when Kaervek's ally Jolrael betrays him at the urging of the planeswalker Teferi. Jamuraa's leaders, led by Jolrael's visions, free Mangara from the amber prison and begin to fight against Kaervek.\n\nThe storyline of \"Weatherlight\" is closely tied to the Weatherlight Saga. The story introduces the Weatherlight and her crew, who travel the planes of the multiverse in search of ancient artifacts known collectively as the Legacy. The captain of the ship, Sisay, is abducted to the shadowy world of Rath. Her old friend and crewmate, a former soldier named Gerrard, is pressed into taking command of the ship to rescue her. The story is continued in \"Magic\"'s \"Tempest\" set.\n\nThe \"Weatherlight\" set was accompanied by a series of fictional works collectively known as the Weatherlight Saga. The saga was intended to be a \"hero's journey\"-style story, in which the characters were classic archetypes. Each was also assigned to represent a color in \"Magic\"'s color wheel, so that the narrative and mechanical elements of the project would be more closely joined.\n\nThen-developer Mark Rosewater chose the skyship Weatherlight and its captain, Sisay, as the germ of the new story. Rosewater has stated that making the story about a ship allowed for narrative flexibility in setting. After developing story and character ideas with Michael Ryan, Rosewater pitched the Saga idea to his bosses. The Saga was heavily referenced in the flavor text and card names of the set.\n\n\"Weatherlight\" marks a turning point in design and marketing philosophy for the \"Magic\" game and brand. While previous sets included allusions to an overarching story, \"Weatherlight\" was the first set to explicitly tell an ordered narrative focused on developed, archetypical characters. Weatherlight marks the first use of a metaplot tied to a \"Magic\" set. The first novel, \"Rath and Storm\", covers events shown in the \"Weatherlight\" set, while later novels tell stories for later game sets. It is referenced in sets until \"Apocalypse\", although the aftermath of Saga events continued to be explored thereafter.\n\nLike , \"Mirage\" began as a set of modifications to Alpha by a group of Richard Garfield's playtesters in winter 1992. Bill Rose, Charlie Catino, Joel Mick, Howard Kahlenberg, Don Felice and Elliott Segal created gameplay modifications and new cards that developed into \"Menagerie\", which developed over the course of three years. In October 1995, \"Mirage\" was sent to Wizards of the Coast for development. Rose lead the development team of Mike Elliott, William Jockusch and Mark Rosewater, while Art Director Sue-Ann Harkey provided \"Mirage\"'s African influenced look.\n\nWhile its origins in playtesting linked it to earlier sets, \"Mirage\" was not designed to stand alone. \"Mirage\" was created as an introduction to Jamuraa, with two more planned expansions to create a cohesive set. This model became the standard for \"Magic: The Gathering\" expansions and began the concept of \"block rotation\".\n\n\"Mirage\"'s public debut was at Pro Tour Atlanta 1996, where professional \"Magic\" players had the challenge of playing sealed deck with cards they had never seen before. \"Mirage\" was also the first set to have pre-releases at more than one city.\n\nWizards of the Coast's design and development team considers \"Mirage\" to be the first set of the \"Silver Age\" or \"modern\" era of \"Magic\". It was the first set to be designed with Limited and Constructed play in mind. Previous designs had been imbalanced for formats like draft and sealed-deck, and cards were designed for casual players rather than with thought of their impact on the tournament scene.\n\nOn December 5, 2005, \"Mirage\" was released on \"\" and was the first retroactively released set there. This was the first time in the three-and-a-half years that the online version of the game had existed that an expansion older than \"\" (2000) became playable on \"MTG Online\". With their introduction on \"MTG Online\", all \"Mirage\" cards received updated creature types and wordings to bring them in line with modern \"Magic\" cards.\n\nIt also introduced rules (5th Edition was released in March 1997).\n\nThe \"Visions\" expansion originated as a split from \"Menagerie\" (the original name for \"Mirage\"), which had grown too large for a single set. For a brief time during its development, \"Visions\" was known by the codename \"Mirage Jr.\" It received its final name shortly later. \"Visions\" was the first set to have the same name as a Magic card printed earlier, and the first set to have a wide dispersal of pre-releases.\n\nAt the time of its release, \"Visions\" was a \"first\" in the release of quality cards at the common level. For instance, River Boa was considered \"very good\" compared to other green creatures, with two abilities (Islandwalk and Regeneration) and a 2/1 power/toughness at a casting cost of only two mana.\n\n\"Visions\" was the last set to contain a poison creature (one that creates poison counters) until Swamp Mosquito was reprinted in \"\". \"Visions\"'s Suq'Ata Assassin was the last new poison creature created by Wizards for 10 years, until Virulent Sliver appeared in \"Future Sight\".\n\nWizards of the Coast started selling \"Visions\" cards for \"\" on April 10, 2006. The cards became legal to use in several formats as they went on sale. Official release events were held on April 13.\n\n\"Mirage\" introduced the first cycle of \"charms\". A charm is a spell that allow a player to choose among three different effects when the charm is played. Since then, similar cycles of charms have appeared in the \"\" block, \"\" block, \"Return to Ravnica\" block, and others. \"Mirage\" also introduced a cycle of enchantments that could be played as instants. It introduced two keywords: flanking and phasing. A creature without flanking gets -1/-1 until end of turn if it blocks a creature with flanking. A permanent with phasing leaves play under certain circumstances, then returns to play at the beginning of its controller's next upkeep.\n\nPhasing and flanking were expanded upon in \"Visions\". \"Visions\" included many creatures that had abilities that triggered upon entering play. \"Visions\" introduced a cycle of lands known as Karoo lands that required you to return a land to your hand to play them.\n\nAlthough \"Weatherlight\" is considered the third set in the Mirage block, it is mechanically distinct and does not prominently feature the keywords introduced in \"Mirage\". Phasing appears on only three cards in \"Weatherlight\", and flanking on only two. \"Weatherlight\" again had a cycle of cantrips, albeit ones that gave a player a card immediately after being played. Many cards in \"Weatherlight\" had graveyard-related abilities. \"Weatherlight\" was the last set to print a card with banding before the keyword was abandoned. It reintroduced the cumulative upkeep keyword with cards whose effects scaled as their cumulative upkeep costs increased. (Cumulative upkeep would not be used again until 2006's \"\").\n\nNotable cards in \"Mirage\" include ', ', ', ', and .\n\nNotable cards in \"Visions\" include ' and '.\n\nNotable cards in \"Weatherlight\" include ' and '\n\nFor \"Mirage\", Wizards signed about 50 artists who had not worked on before, including fan favorites such as John Avon and Donato Giancola.\n\n"}

They are found in all domains of life. These proteins have peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity, which catalyzes the isomerization of peptide bonds from \"trans\" form to \"cis\" form at proline residues and facilitates protein folding.\n\nCyclophilin A is a cytosolic and highly abundant protein. The protein belongs to a family of isozymes, including cyclophilins B and C, and natural killer cell cyclophilin-related protein. Major isoforms have been found within single cells, including inside the Endoplasmic reticulum, and some are even secreted.\n\nHuman genes encoding proteins containing the cyclophilin domain include:\n\nCyclophilin A (CYPA) also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), which is found in the cytosol, has a beta barrel structure with two alpha helices and a beta-sheet. Other cyclophilins have similar structures to cyclophilin A. The cyclosporin-cyclophilin A complex inhibits a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, the inhibition of which is thought to suppress organ rejection by halting the production of the pro-inflammatory molecules TNF alpha and interleukin 2.\n\nCyclophilin A is also known to be recruited by the Gag polyprotein during HIV-1 virus infection, and its incorporation into new virus particles is essential for HIV-1 infectivity.\n\nCyclophilin D (PPIF, note that literature is confusing, the mitochondrial cyclophilin is encoded by the PPIF gene), which is located in the matrix of mitochondria, is only a modulatory, but may or may not be a structural component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The pore opening raises the permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane, allows influx of cytosolic molecules into the mitochondrial matrix, increases the matrix volume, and disrupts the mitochondrial outer membrane. As a result, the mitochondria fall into a functional disorder, so the opening of the pore plays an important role in cell death. Cyclophilin D is thought to regulate the opening of the pore because cyclosporin A, which binds to CyP-D, inhibits the pore opening.\n\nHowever, mitochondria obtained from the cysts of Artemia franciscana, do not exhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore \n\nOverexpression of Cyclophilin A has been linked to poor response to inflammatory diseases, the progression or metastasis of cancer, and aging.\n\nCyclophilin inhibitors, such as cyclosporin, are being developed to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Cyclophilin inhibition may also be a therapy for liver diseases.\n"}

{"id": "2219310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219310", "title": "In Case of Emergency", "text": "In Case of Emergency\n\nIn Case of Emergency (ICE) is a program that enables first responders, such as paramedics, firefighters, and police officers, as well as hospital personnel, to contact the next of kin of the owner of a mobile phone to obtain important medical or support information (the phone must be unlocked and working). The phone entry (or entries) should supplement or complement written (such as wallet, bracelet, or necklace) information or indicators. The programme was conceived in the mid-2000s and promoted by British paramedic Bob Brotchie in May 2005. It encourages people to enter emergency contacts in their mobile phone address book under the name \"ICE\". Alternatively, a person can list multiple emergency contacts as \"ICE1\", \"ICE2\", etc. \n\nThe program has been criticized by some emergency responders and the hoaxbusters site.\n\nFollowing research carried out by Vodafone that showed that fewer than 25% of people carry any details of who they would like telephoned following a serious accident, a campaign encouraging people to do this was started in May 2005 by Bob Brotchie of the East of England Ambulance Service in the UK. The idea has taken off since 7 July 2005 London bombings.\n\nWhen interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 \"Today\" programme on 12 July 2005, Brotchie said:\n\"I was reflecting on some difficult calls I've attended, where people were unable to speak to me through injury or illness and we were unable to find out who they were. I discovered that many people, obviously, carry mobile phones and we were using them to discover who they were. It occurred to me that if we had a uniform approach to searching inside a mobile phone for an emergency contact then that would make it easier for everyone.\"\n\nBrotchie also urged mobile phone manufacturers to support the campaign by adding an ICE heading to phone number lists of all new mobile phones.\n\nWith this additional information and medical information, first responders can access this information from the victim's phone in the event of an emergency. In the event of a major trauma, it is critical to have this information within the golden hour, which can increase the chances of survival.\n\nWhile some emergency responders lauded the suggestion others have criticized it.\n\nIn Germany, the \"In Case of Emergency\" concept has been criticised for many reasons:\nIt is recommended that one carries contact information and relevant medical information in writing inside one's wallet, and not rely on ICE contacts as a primary means of identification. \n\nOther problems include language-dependent text (ICE in English, ECU in French, etc. etc.), the difficulty of accessing locked, discharged or broken phones, differences among mobile models requiring training of emergency responders.\n\nMany smartphone models have dedicated ICE contact information functionality either built into the OS or available as apps. Saving duplicate phone numbers on a phone without dedicated ICE functionality may cause the ICE and regular contacts to be combined, or cause the caller ID to fail for incoming calls from a close friend or relative. (To avoid this, some use the \"tel:\" URI scheme to put the phone number in the ICE contact's \"home page\" field.)\n\nA \"competing proposal\" exists called E.123 which is also an official ITU-T standard.\n\nThe hoaxbuster site classified the claims of the program as \"partly true, partly false\".\n\nFor security purposes, many mobile phone owners now lock their mobiles, requiring a passcode to be entered in order to access the device. This hinders the ability of first responders to access the ICE phone list entry. In response to this problem, many device manufacturers have provided a mechanism to specify some text to be displayed while the mobile is in the locked state. The owner of the phone can specify their \"In Case of Emergency\" contact and also a \"Lost and Found\" contact. For example, BlackBerry mobiles permit the \"Owner\" information to be set in the Settings → Options → Owner menu item. Android users running Android Nougat (Android 7.0) or higher also have the ability to program emergency information and contact details accessible by others through the emergency call screen when the device is locked. Emergency contacts can be added to iPhone lock screens with the iOS Health application, and accessed by tapping or swiping to the Emergency dialer, where calls to 911 or another pre-specified number can be made, and the Medical ID button is displayed as well. When accessing this Medical ID, the user's name, health information, allergies and medications can be listed, along with the ability to directly contact listed emergency contacts.\n\nAlternatively, some handsets provide access to a list of ICE contacts directly from the \"locked\" screen. There are also smartphone \"apps\" (applications) that allow custom ICE and emergency information to be displayed on the \"locked\" screen. For instance, the Medical ID Android app enables quick access to medical information and emergency contacts.\n\nThe popularity of the program is difficult to assess. A CNN article mentioned that the program might be spreading into North America, but gave different instructions to its readers.\n\n\n"}

He was brought up Roman Catholic. After graduating from Clarkston High School, Fuller attended Lewis–Clark State College in Lewiston. He later transferred to the USC School of Cinematic Arts, but dropped out and began working as an office temp.\n\nAs a contributing writer, Fuller's work has been featured on several shows, including \"\" and \"\", earning twenty-two episode writing credits for the \"Star Trek\" franchise. Fuller is himself a fan of science fiction, and in an interview said that his favorite \"Star Trek\" series were the , followed by \"Deep Space Nine\", \"\" and \"Voyager\". Fuller has called \"DS9\" his favorite spin-off, stating: \"There were lots of new and innovative things going on during \"Deep Space Nine\" and that's why it's my favorite of the new series\". It was much more character-based\". Fuller worked on the \"DS9\" episodes \"The Darkness and the Light\" and \"Empok Nor\".\n\nFuller wrote the teleplay for the 2002 adaptation of \"Carrie\", based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. Next, he created \"Dead Like Me\" which ran on Showtime for two seasons from 2003 to 2004, although Fuller left early into the first season. He then co-created \"Wonderfalls\" with Todd Holland, which ran on Fox in 2004, with only four episodes being aired and the rest premiering on DVD. Near the end of 2004, Fuller got a pilot commitment from NBC for \"The Assistants\", although the show never got past the script stage. In 2005, Fuller wrote the pilot to the animated comedy \"The Amazing Screw-On Head\" for the Sci Fi Channel, which aired in 2006 but was not picked up for a series. He next worked on NBC series \"Heroes\", where he joined as a consulting producer after the pilot and became a co-executive producer for the first season. He also wrote a couple episodes for \"Heroes\", including \"Company Man\" which \"TV Guide\" named one of the 100 greatest episodes in television history.\nNext he created \"Pushing Daisies\", about a pie-maker (Lee Pace) who can bring dead things back to life temporarily, debuted on ABC on October 3, 2007. On July 17, 2008, the show was nominated for twelve Emmy Awards from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, including one for Fuller for Outstanding Writing of a Comedy Series. It ultimately won seven Emmy Awards: for Best Supporting Actress (Kristin Chenoweth), Best Art Direction, Best Costume, Best Music, Best Make-Up, Best Editing, and Best Direction of a Comedy Series (Barry Sonnenfeld). The second season of \"Pushing Daisies\" began October 1, 2008, on ABC. In mid-November, ABC announced that it would not order new episodes for season two after the 13th. The series' final episode aired on June 13, 2009.\n\nWith the cancellation of \"Pushing Daisies\", Fuller signed a seven-figure, two-year deal with Universal Media Studios. He rejoined the writing staff of \"Heroes\" for the 20th episode of the third season, and again became a consulting producer, playing a \"key role\" on the writing staff. After working on some of the story arcs for the next season of \"Heroes\", Fuller announced he was moving on to other projects. His next projects, both a result of the Universal deal and developed for NBC, were \"Sellevision\", developed with Bryan Singer and based on the book of the same name by Augusten Burroughs, and \"No Kill\", Fuller's first sitcom. Neither project got past the scripting stage. Fuller's next project, again for NBC, was \"Mockingbird Lane\", a revival of the classic sitcom \"The Munsters\". A pilot was produced, but the show did not receive a series order, and the pilot aired as a Halloween special. Fuller next worked on \"Mind Fields\" with Lisa Joy for USA Network, which was not picked up.\n\nFuller owns Living Dead Guy Productions.\n\nFuller's next project was the Hannibal Lecter series \"Hannibal\", which premiered on NBC in 2013, and renewed for a second season in 2014. Fuller had developed \"High Moon\" for Syfy, based on the book \"The Lotus Caves\", which filmed a pilot in late 2013, but was not given a series order.\n\nBy July 2014, Starz had acquired the airing rights to the novel \"American Gods\", and that Fuller, with producer Michael Green, would develop the novel into a television series. The show premiered April 30, 2017. The show was renewed for a second season, but Fuller and Green left the show due to budgetary issues during the writing stage of the second season. In early 2018, Fuller was working on a television adaptation of \"The Vampire Chronicles\" novel series by Anne Rice. He dropped out of the project in July of the same year.\n\nNicknamed the \"Fullerverse\" by Fuller's fans, all of Fuller's series are implied to take place in the same universe.\n\nMarianne Marie Beetle (played by actress Beth Grant) first appears in the \"Wonderfalls\" episode \"Muffin Buffalo\", and has subsequently appeared in the \"Pushing Daisies\" episode \"Comfort Food\" and in the pilot of \"Mockingbird Lane\". Similarly, Gretchen Speck-Horowitz (played by Chelan Simmons) first appears in the \"Wonderfalls\" episode \"Pink Flamingos\" and subsequently appeared in the \"Hannibal\" episode \"Amuse-Bouche\", reverting to her maiden name after her divorce.\n\nMeanwhile, in the \"Pushing Daisies\" episode \"Bzzzzzzzzz!\", Ned mentions that he works for Happy Time Temp Agency when trying to go undercover, the same place where Georgia \"George\" Lass works in \"Dead Like Me\".\n\nAlso, the fictional brand \"Lil' Ivey's\" first appeared in the \"Wonderfalls\" episode \"Cocktail Bunny\" on a box of cocktail cherries and later appeared in the \"Pushing Daisies\" episode \"Kerplunk\", this time on a bag of macaroni.\n\nIn a more subtle nod, Fuller has also reinterpreted a few of his characters in later series. Georgia \"George\" Lass (played by Ellen Muth), having first appeared in \"Dead Like Me\", was reinterpreted as Georgia Madchen (also played by Muth) in the \"Hannibal\" episodes \"Buffet Froid\" and \"Relevés\". This similarity is furthered by their last names: \"lass\" is an English synonym for girl while \"Mädchen\" is a German word meaning the same. In another nod to Georgia Lass being a reaper (therefore both dead and alive) in \"Dead Like Me\", in \"Hannibal\" Georgia Madchen is a killer who suffers from numerous medical conditions including Cotard's syndrome, a delusion disorder that has her convinced she is actually dead. In a similar manner, Reggie Lass from \"Dead Like Me\" (played by Britt McKillip) was reinterpreted as Miriam Lass (played by Anna Chlumsky), who first appears in the \"Hannibal\" episode \"Entrée\". Similarly, in the \"Hannibal\" episode \"Takiawase\", an acupuncturist (played by Amanda Plummer) who is under investigation for lobotomizing patients is named Katherine Pimms, which is also the cover name used by Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles (played by Anna Friel) in multiple episodes of \"Pushing Daisies\".\n\nA visual nod to \"Wonderfalls\" was given in the \"Heroes\" first-season episode \"Better Halves\" when the smoosh-faced wax lion central to \"Wonderfalls\" was seen on a bedside table.\n\nFuller is in a long-term relationship with interior designer Scott Roberts. In a 2007 interview, he stated that his favorite film was the 2001 French film \"Amélie\", which was one of the inspirations for \"Pushing Daisies\": \"All the things I love are represented in that movie. It's a movie that will make me cry based on kindness as opposed to sadness.\"\n\n"}

Forty of his works are in the National Portrait Gallery in London.\n\nHe was born at Frome, Somerset, in August 1811. He was a pupil of Samuel William Reynolds, the mezzotinto engraver, but the style in which he at first worked was that known as ‘chalk’ or ‘stipple.’ He began his career by engraving plates for the editions of Edmund Lodge's \"Portraits of Illustrious Personages of Great Britain\", and for the series of \"Portraits of Eminent Conservatives and Statesmen\", as well as for Charles Heath's \"Book of Beauty\" and other works.\n\nIn 1861, Ryall was living with his wife Georgina, niece and two servants at 15 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea.\n\nRyall died at his residence at Cookham, Berkshire, on 14 September 1867.\n\nRyall's larger plates are a combination of line and stipple. They include \"The Coronation of Queen Victoria\", after the picture by Sir George Hayter, and \"The Christening of the Princess Royal\", after Charles Robert Leslie, the engraving that gained him the honorary appointment of historical engraver to the queen.

Since its initial release in 1986, \"Zodiac\" has sold 4 million copies worldwide. Graysmith was a cartoonist for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and later also wrote \"Zodiac Unmasked\".\n\nThis book chronicles the history of the self-named \"Zodiac\" killer who was active in the 1960s and 70s in California from first hand details covered by Robert Graysmith's investigative efforts to unmask the \"Zodiac\" killer. The novel describes the investigations of the many law enforcement branches such as the LAPD, the FBI, the CIA , etc., that worked on the case and other murders that the \"Zodiac\" had proclaimed he committed, including the 1966 Cheri Jo Bates stabbing. Later chapters deal with Graysmith's many theories on the case, and the book eventually cites two possible suspects (who are given pseudonyms), Bob Starr and Donald Andrews, and details some of the circumstantial evidence against them. Graysmith received assistance from police departments that fell within the jurisdictions of the murders, and especially from Inspector Dave Toschi from the San Francisco Police Department, who had worked the Zodiac case. Although the case was never solved, there were instances where solid evidence was held among multiple suspects, even after the Zodiac murders had stopped.\n\nRobert Graysmith was a cartoonist working for \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" in the 1960s when the Zodiac murders started. The Zodiac sent letters to \"The Chronicle\" which he wanted published in the paper urgently. The letters included evidence that he was in fact the Zodiac; while committing one of his crimes, the \"Zodiac\" cut a piece of bloody cloth from one of his victims and attached it to several of his hand written letters to disable the thought of a fake \"Zodiac\" writing to the San Francisco Chronicle. Graysmith saw the letters arriving at \"The Chronicle\" and became intrigued. For years the cartoonist kept his own scrapbook of evidence, from which he independently attempted to determine the Zodiac's identity. When asked why he began working on the book, Graysmith replied, \"I saw it going into obscurity. Nobody is sharing all the different jurisdictions, and all this information. What if I as a private citizen went around and got all this information?\" This led to a 10-year period to collect information, and eventually the book was published in 1986 after a number of delays.\n\nThe film adaptation \"Zodiac\" (2007) is roughly based on Graysmith's books, \"Zodiac\" (1986) and \"Zodiac Unmasked\" (2002). The film follows the work of Graysmith as a cartoonist in 1969 aiding the authorities in figuring the identity of the infamous Zodiac killer.\n"}

During the 1994-95 season, Schwab was joined by fellow 1990 draftee Mike Dunham between the pipes.

The band is based at the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, at in northwestern Wisconsin, which surrounds Lac Courte Oreilles (\"Odaawaa-zaaga'igan\" in the Ojibwe language, meaning \"Ottawa Lake\"). The main reservation's land is in west-central Sawyer County, but two small plots of off-reservation trust land are located in Rusk, Burnett, and Washburn counties. The Reservation was established in 1854 by the second Treaty of La Pointe.\n\nThe Lac Courte Oreille ceded land under a treaty they signed with the United States in 1837, the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe, and the first 1854 Treaty of La Pointe. The tribal reservation has a land area of , including the trust lands, and a population of 3,013 persons as of the 2000 census. The most populous community is Little Round Lake, at the reservation's northwest corner. It is south of the non-reservation city of Hayward, the county seat of Sawyer County.\n\nLac Courte Oreilles is a land which is almost entirely covered by a forest and several lakes. To the northeast and east of Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation is Chequamegon National Forest, which was established in 1933 during the Great Depression. White-owned lumber companies had cleared the land of the trees earlier in the century and, during the Depression, Civilian Conservation Corps workers planted new trees.\n\nToday, both the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation and Chequamegon National Forest are recovering from the clear-cutting conducted by the lumber companies. Numerous lakes are within the borders of Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation or border it, including Ashegon, Blueberry, Chief, Cristner, Devils, Green, Grindstone, Gurno, Lac Courte Oreilles, Lake Chippewa, Little Round, Little Lac Courte Oreilles, Pokegama, Rice, Scott, Osprey, Spring, Summit, and Tyner lakes.\n\nWithin the Reservation borders is the protected Grindstone Creek State Wildlife Management Area. Wild rice, called \"manoomin\" in Ojibwe language, grows on many of the waterways on the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation. Citizens of the Reservation still harvest it in the traditional way and it is one of the staples of the community.\n\nThe band is federally recognized as a tribe and has its own elected government, consisting of a chairman and tribal council. Members are elected from enrolled members of the tribe.\n\nIt owns and operates a tribal college, Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa Community College, located in Hayward. The Tribe owns and operates the Sevenwinds Casino, to generate revenue for its people's welfare. It also operates a community radio station, WOJB-FM.\n\nThe reservation hosts an \"Honor the Earth\" Pow Wow every summer. Rock drummer Mickey Hart's recording of some of the performers, \"Honor The Earth Powwow--Songs Of The Great Lake Indians,\" became a minor national hit in 1991.\n\nThe Anishinaabe, part of the Algonquian languages family of peoples originating along the Atlantic Coast, migrated west and have lived in what is now northern Wisconsin for a long time. Following the Seven Fires Prophecy, Anishinaabe leaders ordered their warriors to expand to the west after they learned that the people mentioned in the prophecy had invaded in the East. They also sent their soldiers as far east as Maine and as far south as Florida, to defend Indian land from the white invaders. According to Native American historian William W. Warren, Anishinaabe people were living in northern Wisconsin before 1492 and the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean area.\n\nThe Dakota Indians referred to the Anishinaabe as the \"Ra-ra-to-oans,\" which means \"People of the Falls.\" The French adopted the name. \n\nIn the 17th century, Anishinaabe warriors from the north of Wisconsin were constantly fighting the white invaders (at that time and in that area, the French and French-Canadian colonists) and their Indian allies. Between 1630 and 1665, thousands of Indians who lived along the northeast Atlantic Coast were being driven from their homes by the French and their Indian allies. Many fled west to the north of present-day Wisconsin, seeking the safety of Lake Michigan and Anishinaabe warriors. The whites and their Indian allies invaded the eastern end of the Lake Superior region but were driven off. Their defeats were serious enough they requested a truce, to which Anishinaabe leaders agreed.\n\nThe French and their Indian allies gained control of the lands east of Lake Michigan: what are now known as New York, southern Ontario, and parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania. That changed in 1680 after Anishinabe warriors were sent to the east to war on the white invaders and their Indian allies. By 1700, Anishinaabe soldiers had driven the whites back to the eastern coast, where they had large fortified settlements. Anishinaabe soldiers subjugated the Indian allies of the whites, who are known historically as the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. Anishinaabe people absorbed them into their population in New York and southern Ontario.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, control of northern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota was hotly contested by the Santee Sioux (Dakota) and the Lake Superior Chippewa (Ojibwe/Anishinaabe). By the close of the 18th century, the Ojibwe had pushed the Dakota out of Wisconsin and much of northern Minnesota to areas west of the Mississippi River. Although the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien recognized only a small portion of present-day Wisconsin as Dakota land, throughout the 18th and well into the 19th centuries, the Dakota and Ojibwe continued to launch military expeditions into each other's territories. The Battle of the Brule, which took place in October, 1842 was a battle between the La Pointe Band of Ojibwe Indians and a war party of Dakota Indians, with the Ojibwe being victorious.\n\nLater on in the 18th and early 19th centuries, more wars were fought between the Anishinaabeg and European Americans. English colonists had taken over rule from the French in eastern Canada and also established dominance up to the Appalachian Mountains in the Thirteen Colonies below the Great Lakes. At the end of the 18th century, those colonies achieved independence as the United States of America. Its settlers had already invaded Indian country west of the Appalachians, and more moved west. The US defeated an alliance of tribes in the Northwest Indian War, opening the area north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi to more settlement by European Americans.\n\nThe War of 1812 between the US and Great Britain was entered into by the Great Lakes Anishinaabeg on the side of Britain in an effort to defend their land. After the war, they signed treaties with the United States, but these were not honored. American settlers continued to encroach on their territories around the Great Lakes. In 1854, the second Treaty of La Pointe with the US established what is now the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation, in addition to other reservations for Ojibwe in this region.\n\nIn the late 19th century, with increased European-American settlement, the United States wanted to relocate all Native Americans from Michigan and Wisconsin to west of the Mississippi River, proposing to consolidate them on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota. The proposed relocation plan proved futile. The tribes resisted and a minor rebellion broke out in 1898 on the Leech Lake Reservation of northern Minnesota. The US finally left the tribes in small rural reservations in these areas.\n\nLac Courte Oreilles reservation has several communities within its borders; most are predominately Native American in population. Little Round Lake is the largest community within the reservation, with a population of 1,081 in the 2010 census. Native Americans make up 90% of the community's population.\n\nChief Lake is a predominantly Indian community, with 80% of the population. New Post has 72% Ojibwe residents. Reserve has a population that is 88% Native American. Northwoods Beach is located on the Reservation's west end, between Grindstone Lake and Lac Courte Oreilles.\n\nNone of the Lac Courte Oreilles communities has developed to the level of a city or town. Most of the population of Reserve is scattered, although the heart of the community is a more dense village. The community's housing units are located in the woods.\n\n\nLac Courte Orellies is one of several reservations that has a relatively large non-Native population within its borders. Broken treaty promises allowed settlement by white squatters and the US allowed them to stay.\n\nThe 2000 census reported the population of the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation at 3,013. Native Americans made up 2,306 of the population, with European Americans comprising the remainder. Non-Indians made up the remainder of the Reservation's population.\n\n\n\n"}

He gained international fame as a writer of French periodicals and a translator from English into French, and he is also recognized as one of the most important Dutch language writers of the 18th century and an influential figure of the Dutch Enlightenment.\n\nHe was born in Utrecht, the second child of Melchior and Maria van Effen. Justus van Effen planned a scholarly career, and around 1699 he began his studies at the University of Utrecht, but after the early death of his father (on 6 May 1706) he was forced to become a private tutor, taking responsibilities for his mother and sister. He had made acquaintances among French émigrés, in connection with whom he began literary life in 1713 by editing a French journal.

A translator from English to French, he translated Swift's \"Tale of a Tub\" into Dutch and Defoe's \"Robinson Crusoe\", and is credited with a significant influence in the bringing of English literature to continental Europe.\n\nAn enthusiast for English periodicals, and in particular, \"The Spectator\" of Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, soon after first issues of The Spectator he launched \"Le Misanthrope\" (1711–1712) (a widely read journal referred to as \"the first moralist periodical on the continent\"), \"Le Bagatelle\" (1718–1719), \"Le nouveau Spectateur François\" (1725) and then in his native language, the \"Hollandsche Spectator\" (1731–1735).\n\nThe \"Hollandsche Spectator\" was one of the most notable papers inspired by \"The Spectator\". Its topics consisted of everything a coffeehouse audience would be interested in: politics, religion and morality, fashion, and humor. Socially conservative, written in a pleasing tone and style, it raised important issues, questioning the reasons behind the waning position of the Dutch Republic on the international scene, and served as literary and moral guide for the bourgeoisie. The \"Hollandsche Spectator\" is considered one of the achievements of the late 18th century Dutch literature, and an inspiration to much Dutch journalism and literature.\n\nVan Effen died in 's-Hertogenbosch, aged 51.\n\n"}

He was one of the early pioneers of computer-based comic-book lettering, and is one of the most prolific creators in that industry.\n\nStarkings' lettering style was originally inspired by British comic strip letterers Bill Nuttall and Tom Frame. Starkings' UK career began with lettering jobs in \"2000 AD\"'s \"Future Shocks\" and various strips in \"Warrior\". From there he moved to Marvel UK where he lettered Zoids in \"Spider-Man Weekly\" and \"Transformers\" before becoming an editor for the company in the late 1980s. Titles he edited included \"Death's Head\" and \"Dragon's Claws\". However, by the beginning of the 1990s he devoted himself exclusively to lettering, finding work in the much larger comic-book industry in the United States.\n\nIn 1992 Starkings founded Comicraft, a studio which trains and employs letterers and designers and provides \"Unique Design and Fine Lettering\" services for comic books from many different publishers. In the mid-1990s Comicraft, online as comicbookfonts.com began to sell their Font designs as software applications through their Active Images publishing company.\n\nOriginally Starkings had intended that the advertisements for these fonts would feature Marvel and DC Comics' characters, however when he failed to receive the authorisation to do that, Starkings created his own character to illustrate the ads – Hip Flask an anthropomorphic hippopotamus \"Information Agent\". Hip Flask has since graduated to his own series of one-shot comic books, published by Active Images. Starkings plotted the first two issues with artist Ladrönn and enlisted the assistance of Joe Casey to co-script. \"Mystery City\" and all subsequent issues are plotted and scripted by Starkings. In 2006 Image Comics launched an ongoing prequel series to \"Hip Flask\", \"Elephantmen\", written by Starkings and illustrated by Axel Medellin, Justin \"Moritat\" Norman, Marian Churchland, Tom Scioli, Henry Flint, Chris Bachalo and Chris Burnham.\n\nIn 2001 the character's similarities with an Australian comic book character called Hairbutt (a bumbling anthropomorphic hippopotamus private detective) led Hairbutt co-creator Bodine Amerikah and Darren Close of OzComics to accuse Hip Flask creator Starkings of plagiarism. Starkings replied that he created Hip Flask without any knowledge of Hairbutt, and that their similarities were a bizarre coincidence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2219387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219387", "title": "Prices of production", "text": "Prices of production\n\nPrices of production (or \"production prices\"; in German \"Produktionspreise\") is a concept in Karl Marx's critique of political economy, defined as \"cost-price + average profit\". A production price can be thought of as a type of supply price for products; it refers to the price levels at which newly produced goods and services would have to be sold by the producers, in order to reach a normal, average \"profit rate\" on the \"capital\" invested to produce the products (not the same as the profit on the turnover). \n\nThe importance of these price levels is, that a lot of other prices are based on them, or derived from them: in Marx's theory, they determine the cost structure of capitalist production. The market prices of products normally oscillate around their production prices, while production prices themselves oscillate around product-\"values\" (the average current replacement cost in labour-time required to make each type of product). \n\nThis understanding already existed in classical political economy (the idea of market prices which gravitate to \"natural prices\" or \"natural price levels\") but, according to Marx, the political economists could not really explain adequately how production prices were \"formed\", or how they could \"regulate\" the trade in commodities. In addition, the political economists could not theoretically reconcile their labour theory of value with value/price deviations, unequal profit/wage ratios and unequal capital compositions. Consequently, the labour theory of value of the political economists was more in the nature of a metaphysical belief, than a scientific proposition.\n\nThe concept of production prices is introduced and elaborated systematically in chapter 9 \"et seq.\" of the third volume of \"Das Kapital\", although it is already referred to in earlier texts by Marx. The first significant discussion occurs in the \"Grundrisse\" (1857-1858), followed by numerous references in \"Theories of Surplus Value\" (1862-1863), letters by Marx to Engels of 2 August 1862 and 30 April 1868 outlining his theory, the \"Resultate\" manuscript (1863-1866), \"Capital, Volume I\" (1867) and \"Capital, Volume II\" (1865-1877).\n\nIn \"Capital, Volume III\", Marx considers the operation of capitalist production as the unity of a \"production\" process and a \"circulation\" process involving commodities, money, and capital. Capitalist production cannot exist without market sales, and therefore it is a type of production that fully depends on market trade. For the purpose of the analysis of the immediate process of capitalist production, which is the main subject of \"Capital, Volume I\", successful market transactions are assumed and market fluctuations are initially mostly disregarded - but that gives only one half of the story. The products have to be sold at a profit, and purchased at a competitive price, through market trade and the circulation of capital.\n\nThe argument in \"Capital, Volume III\" (Marx intended to publish still more volumes, but did not manage to do so) is that the sales of newly produced commodities in the capitalist mode of production are \"regulated\" by their production prices. What products will sell for, has to do with what it normally costs to make them, \"plus\" the profit mark-up that will secure a normal average return on capital for the producing enterprise. For efficient producers, there will normally be a larger margin between their costs and their sales-revenue (more profit), and for less efficient producers, there will be a smaller margin between their costs and revenue (less profit). Marx's controversial claim is that the magnitude of the production prices for products is determined ultimately by their current replacement costs in average labour time, i.e. by the \"value\" of products.\n\nA lot of the academic debate about Marx's concept of production prices is probably caused by the fact that Marx never finalized the text of the third volume of \"Capital\" for publication, although he drafted it before publishing the first volume. The book was edited together posthumously by Friedrich Engels, who tried to make a polished story out of a mass of draft manuscripts Marx left behind. Marx sketched complicated issues in a shorthand way which is sometimes ambiguous and incomplete, and does not make all the implications explicit. According to the German Marxian scholar Michael Heinrich, \"Marx was nowhere near solving all of the conceptual problems\". However, Marx's concept is also frequently confused with similar concepts in other economic theories. \nFor most economists, the concept of production prices corresponds roughly to Adam Smith's concept of \"natural prices\" and the modern neoclassical concept of long-term competitive equilibrium prices under constant returns to scale. Nevertheless, the function of prices of production within Marx's theory differs from \"both\" classical political economy \"and\" neoclassical economics.\n\nA production price for outputs in Marx's sense always has two main components: the \"cost-price\" of producing the outputs (including the costs of materials, equipment, operating expenses, and wages) and a \"gross profit margin\" (the additional value realized in excess of the cost-price, when goods are sold, which Marx calls surplus value). \n\nMarx's argument is that price-levels for products are determined by input cost-prices, turnovers and average profit rates on output, which are in turn determined principally by aggregate labour-costs, the rate of surplus value and the growth rate of final demand. These price levels determine how much of the new output value that is created in excess of its cost price can actually be realized by enterprises as their gross profit. \n\nThe suggestion is, that the differences among most producers with regard to their profit rates on capital invested will tend to \"level out\" as a result of business competition, so that a general norm emerges for the profitability of industries.\n\nIn capitalist production, a basic profit impost is the normal precondition for the supply of goods and services. When competition for product markets intensifies, the producers' margin between cost prices and sale prices, their true income, shrinks. In that case, the producers can only maintain their profits, either by reducing their costs and improving productivity, or by capturing a bigger market share and selling more product in less time, or both (the only other option they can try is product differentiation). In a well-established product-market, however, the fluctuations in supply and demand are usually not very large. \n\nThis basic market logic was already well known by medieval merchant capitalists long before the dawn of the modern era in the 15th century. Medieval merchant houses could certainly estimate their own rate of surplus value and profit rate (the amount of (surplus-)labour required to yield a certain financial result or valorization) but they usually did not have so much knowledge about socially average profit rates; few relevant data or statistics were publicly available and a \"general rate of profit\" might not exist anyhow, for lack of an integrated national market for products and capital, and given the limited scope of industrialization.\n\nThe regulating price of a given type of product is a sort of modal average price level, above or below which people would be much less likely to trade the product. If the price is too high, buyers cannot afford to buy it, or try to get cheaper alternatives. If the price is too low, sellers cannot cover their costs and make a profit. So normally there is a limited range of prices within which the product can be traded, with upper and lower bounds. \n\nThe production price then refers basically to the \"normal or dominant price level\" for a type of product that prevails during a longer interval of time. It presupposes that both the inputs and the outputs of production are \"priced\" goods and services—that is, that production is fully integrated in fairly sophisticated market relations enabling a sum of capital invested into it to be transformed into a larger sum of capital. In pre-capitalist economies, this was not the case; many inputs and outputs of production were not priced. \n\nMarx's claim is that the production prices of products themselves are fundamentally determined by the comparative labour requirements of those products, and therefore are constrained by the law of value. Since, however, not all goods are produced or reproducible goods, not all goods have production prices. A production price in Marx's sense can exist only in markets developed sufficiently for a \"normal\" rate of profit on production capital invested to become the ruling average for a group of producers.\n\nSubstantively, Marx argues that the prices of new products sold will, assuming free competition for an open market, tend to settle at an average level that enables at least a \"normal\" rate of profit on the capital invested to produce them, and, as a corollary, that if such a socially average rate of profit cannot be reached, it is much less likely that the products will be produced at all (because of comparatively unfavourable profitability conditions). Marx defines the \"general rate of profit\" as the (weighted) average of all the average profit rates in different branches of production - it is a \"grand average\" profit rate on production capital. The simplest indicator of this rate is obtained by dividing total surplus value by total production capital employed.\n\nAccording to Marx's theory, investment capital is likely to shift out of production activities where the rate of profit is low and toward activities where profitability is higher; the \"leading\" sectors of industry are those where profitability is highest (today, these are in the production of computer facilities & hi-tech, healthcare, oil products and finance which serve the richer strata of the world population). \n\nThe precondition is the free mobility of capital and labour, and thus there is a systemic tendency to remove all obstacles preventing investors from investing in sectors where profits are higher. If, for any reason, the free movement of capital is blocked or restricted, large differences in the profit rates of enterprises are likely to occur. In general, the trajectory of capitalist development is determined by the industries where the profits are the best, because their products are in high demand, because of special production or market advantages, etc. \n\nAccording to Marx, the movements of different production prices relative to one another importantly affect how the total \"cake\" of new surplus value produced is distributed as profit among competing capitalist enterprises. They are the basis of the competitive position of the producers, since they fundamentally determine profit yields relative to costs.\n\nSome writers argue that Marx's production price is similar, or performs the same theoretical function, as the \"natural prices\" of classical political economy found, for example, in the writings of Adam Smith and David Ricardo (though the concept of natural prices is much older). This is the orthodox Marxist view, based on quotations where Marx says that his concept of production prices recalls the classical idea of natural prices. In this case, Marx's production price would be essentially a \"centre of gravity\" around which prices for outputs in a competitive market will fluctuate in the long run (cf. Fred Moseley's view). \n\nThis is an interpretation within the framework of equilibrium economics, which suggests that production prices are really a kind of \"equilibrium prices\". It can be supported with some textual evidence, insofar as Marx sometimes defines the production price as the price that would apply if the supply and demand for products were balanced. At other times, he refers to a \"long-term average price\" or a \"regulating price\". He does not say precisely how these three different concepts are related.\n\nThe main objection against equating production prices with natural prices is that Marx's concept of production prices is precisely a \"critique\" of the \"natural prices\". Support for this interpretation can be found in \"Capital, Volume I\", where Marx criticizes and ridicules the concept of a \"natural price of labour\" - this concept, he argues, rests on confusions of several different economic categories.\nSimilarly, in \"Capital, Volume III\", Marx rejects the concept of a \"natural\" interest rate, arguing that what this really refers to is just the interest rate that results out of free competition. According to this argument, there is actually nothing \"natural\" about the allegedly \"natural\" prices - they are socially determined effects of capitalist production and trade. More importantly, the existence of production prices does not logically depend on, or presuppose, an equilibrium state. \n\nIf the classical economists talked about the \"naturalness\" of price-levels, this was ultimately a theoretical apologism; they could not reconcile their labour theory of value with the theory of the distribution of capital. They \"assumed\" a market balance, without proving how it could exist. \n\nThe general theory behind the concept of natural prices was that the free play of markets would, through successive adjustments in the trading process, \"naturally\" converge on price levels at which sellers could cover their costs and make a normal profit, while buyers could afford to buy products; with the effect, that relative labour requirements would be genuinely proportional to relative prices. Yet classical political economy provided no credible theory of how this process could actually occur. Since it confused and conflated the value of labour power with the price of labour, commodity values with their production prices, and surplus value with profit, i.e. because it mixed up values and prices, it could in the end explain the normal price levels of commodities only as \"natural\" phenomena.\n\nIn the sphere of capitalist production, Marx argues, commodity \"values\" are directly observable only as prices of production for outputs, established jointly by average input costs and by the ruling profit margins applying to outputs sold. It is a result of the establishment of regular, developed market trade; the production price averages reflect the fact that production has become totally integrated into the circuits of commodity trade, in which capital accumulation has become the dominant motive. \n\nWhat prices of production simultaneously hide, he argues, is the social nature of the valorization process—that is, how exactly an increase in capital value has occurred through production. The direct connection between labour time and value, still visible in simple commodity production, is largely effaced; only cost prices and sale prices remain, and it seems that any of the factors of production (which Marx calls the \"Holy Trinity\" of capitalism) can contribute new value to output, paving the way for the concept of the production function.\n\nThe first interpretative difficulty concerns the existence of various production prices. For more than a century, almost all Marxists, Sraffians and Post-Keynesians simply took Marx's concept of production prices for granted, as being more or less the same as Smith's and Ricardo's \"natural price\" idea (that is how it was taught, and presented in textbooks), and they did not inquire into the concept in precise detail. They believed, that the idea of a production price was simple, obvious and not controversial. So they missed altogether the fact that in \"Capital, Volume III\" Marx identified (though often not very clearly) at least \"six\" main types of production prices:\n\n\nThese different prices are revealed when we study the composition of the cost structure of a product at different stages of its production and supply. One source of interpretive difficulty is that Marx often assumes in his shorthand drafts that these six kinds of prices all refer to the same thing. But that is true only in the special case where one enterprise sells directly to the final consumer.\n\nThe reason for this conflation is probably that Marx's real analytical concern was not really with the pricing processes as such, but with the main factors influencing the realisation and distribution of new surplus-value produced, when sales occur. After all, his argument was that competition in capitalism revolves around the quest of obtaining \"maximum surplus-value\" from production in the form of generic profit income (profit, interest, rent). The question was: how does a sum of capital invested in production get transformed into a larger sum of capital? What are the dynamics and overall results of that process? What are the implications for the process of economic reproduction?\n\nThe existence of different types of production prices implies a much more complex picture than Marx initially provides in his discussion of the leveling out of profit rates through price competition. Thus, for example, in his discussion of ground rent, Marx claims that farm products can be persistently sold for more than their price of production, but below their value, while many manufactured products obtain their price of production only because they are sold for more than their value. In Marx's more developed theory of the circulation of commodities, the values of products, their prices of production and their market prices are all semi-autonomous variables which can both diverge and converge, through constant market fluctuations, affecting the profitability of enterprises. Nevertheless, Marx claims they will mostly tend to converge in the long term.\n\nA second source of interpretive difficulty is that in his draft manuscript Marx often conflates (1) \"capital advanced\" (to acquire inputs necessary for production) with (2) \"capital in use\" and with (3) \"capital consumed\" (that fraction of the value of inputs used up in the production of new output). In his simplified quantitative examples, he just assumes very abstractly, for the sake of argument, that:\n\nMost probably the reason was that his real interest was in the overall dynamics of capital accumulation, competition, and the realisation of surplus value produced, assuming output would sell. He was thinking of grand averages and overall results. The simplified picture does not obtain in reality, among other things because, as Marx himself notes, capitalist competition turns on buying commodities below their value and selling them above their value (or, in the ideal competitive situation, to sell them below their value at a good profit, with a high turnover).\n\nMarx's theory is frequently confused with input-output economics and the marginalist theory of capital, in which total inputs and total outputs are always exactly equal in value, an equality accomplished by treating the factor income which is gross profit \"as an input\", so that profit is both a cost and a revenue at the same time. Marx did not talk about inputs and outputs in this double-entry bookkeeping sense, where the source of funds balances against the use of funds; instead, he was concerned with how a sum of capital was transformed into a larger sum of capital through a net addition of new value created by workers in production. He was not really talking about quantities of input commodities and quantities of output commodities, but about quantities of \"capital\" required for commodity production and quantities of \"capital\" created by commodity production.\n\nIf indeed the \"value\" of commodities bought was exactly equal to the value of commodities sold, capitalists would not even invest in production, because they would get no profit out of it. Their income would be offset exactly by their costs, yielding a zero net gain. So from Marx's point of view, input-output economics really mystified the \"capital-relationship\", i.e. the ability of the bourgeoisie to capitalize on the surplus labour of the workforce in virtue of its ownership of the means of production (in chapter 48 of \"Capital, Volume III\", he refers satirically to the factors of production theory as the \"holy trinity\" of political economy).\n\nA third source of interpretive difficulty concerns the question of \"what kinds of prices\" production prices really are. Do these prices really exist, and if so, in what way? Or are they only \"theoretical\" or \"ideal\" prices? What exactly is the \"average\" an \"average\" of? What does the \"cost-price\" really refer to, and at what point in the process (inputs purchased, output produced before sales, output sold)? Marx talks about production prices variously as: \nConsequently, it remains somewhat ambiguous in what way such prices exist in reality. The conceptual challenge in modelling is to show how these three variables are related. It could, in principle, also be argued that \"some\" types of production prices are \"empirical\" price averages, while other ones only express \"theoretical\" price-levels. Obviously, if production prices are regarded only as purely \"theoretical\" entities, then it is not possible to claim also that they \"really regulate\" actual prices. A price level which exists only in theory, and not in reality, cannot be said to \"determine\" real price-levels (other than in the sense of publicly available price information influencing market expectations).\n\nThe problem with the popular Newtonian metaphor of production prices as \"centres of gravity\", or alternatively the stochastic metaphor of production prices as \"attractors\" of market prices (both used in econophysics), is that they do not provide any causal explanation of how the \"gravitation\" or \"attraction\" process actually occurs in the real world, as a social process. The meaning of the metaphors keeps slip-sliding between \"empirical\" price-levels, \"theoretical\" price-levels and \"regulating\" price-levels. The \"gravitation\" could be interpreted as an actual physical process, an empirical stochastic result, or a purely theoretical description. Whatever the case, it must be explained how the gravitation process actually occurs. \"Price-numbers\" ultimately cannot substitute for a realistic \"ontology\" of prices and a realistic explanation of price structures.\n\nIn grappling with these issues, it must also be remembered that when Marx lived there was little macro-economic statistical data available that would enable theoretical hypotheses to be tested and relativised. Marx had deduced the motions of capital essentially from an enormous amount of economic literature he read, plus available commercial and government statistics. When, towards the end of his life, he toyed with the idea of investigating economic fluctuations econometrically, Samuel Moore convinced him this was not possible, because relevant economic data and mathematical tools did not exist yet. Comprehensive macro-economic data became available only half a century later.\n\nMarx had pointed the way to solving the problems raised by the classical political economists, without however providing a complete answer. He really believed though that a \"general rate of industrial profit\", applying economy-wide to all industries, would be formed (at least in the sense of the \"minimally acceptable\" profit rate that is the bottom line for the average business operation) but in truth he lacked the data to prove it. He did not discuss in any detail the difference between distributed and undistributed profit, or tax requirements, and how this might affect profit statements. His discussion was limited to physical capital and labour employed, abstracting from ancillary costs and incomes unrelated to production which enterprises usually have (including tax imposts and subsidies), asset transactions, and changes in market prices.\n\nThe concept of production prices is one \"building block\" in Marx's theory of \"the tendency of differences between rates of profit on production capital to level out through competition\" which aimed to tackle a theoretical problem left unsolved by David Ricardo. This problem concerned the question of explaining how an average or \"normal\" return on production capital invested (e.g. 8-16%) could become established, so that capitals of equal size reaped equal profits, even although the enterprises differed in capital compositions and amounts of labour performed (see labor theory of value) and consequently generated different amounts of new value. \n\nIntuitively, if the labour theory of value is true, then firms which use more labour to produce products would also create more value, and receive bigger profits. In reality, it is just the other way round: more efficient firms which use less labour to produce products receive bigger profits.\n\nAccording to Marx, this was not simply a logical problem, a social accounting problem or theoretical problem, but a \"structural contradiction\" intrinsic to the capitalist mode of production, which had to be continually mediated. The fact that more or less value could be appropriated by investors from the labour-efforts of the workers employed, and thus that different labour efforts were unequally rewarded, was in his eyes central to the competitive process - in which the norms of labour effort continually clashed with the norms of profitability. \n\nOn the surface, it looked to the individual observer as if profit yields on capital determine expenditures on labour, but in aggregate, it is - according to Marx - just the other way around, since the volume of labour-time worked determined how much profit could be distributed among producing capitalists, via the sales of their products. The mass of surplus labour performed in the sphere of production set a limit for the mass of surplus value that could be distributed as profit in the sphere of circulation.\n\nIn some interpretations of the Marxian transformation problem, total \"(production) prices\" for output \"must\" equal total \"values\" by definition, and total profits must by definition equal total surplus value. However, Marx himself explicitly denied in chapter 49 of the third volume of Das Kapital that such an exact mathematical identity actually applies. As soon as synchronic and diachronic variability in labour productivity is admitted, then the two famous identities cannot be true even in theory. \n\nSubsequently, Frederick Engels emphasized in this regard that an idealization of reality is not the same thing as reality itself, in a letter to Conrad Schmidt dated March 12, 1895. At best, it is an assumption used in modelling, which is justified if - as Marx believed - the divergence between total values and total production prices is quantitatively not very great, because actual labour expenditures and market competition constrain their divergence. But all this has never bothered neo-classical scholars such as Paul Samuelson in their interpretation of what Marx tried to do.\n\nLogically, the only way Marx has to express an identity of aggregated output \"prices\" and aggregated output \"values\", is to say that both of the totals are equal to exactly the same quantity of abstract labour time, or a quantity of gold. But this equivalence is only asserted \"by definition.\" In the real world, there exist no causal forces that could guarantee such an exact match. Moreover, the identity cannot be empirically proved in any direct way, since to find the quantitative relationship between labour-time and value, a relationship between labour-time and money must already be assumed.\n\nThe \"accounting\" interpretation of production prices (value/price identity at the macro-level) by economists, according to which price distributions and value distributions can be inferred from each other, would suggest that the production price is empirically obtained from a straightforward \"statistical averaging\" of aggregated cost prices and profits. In that case, the production price is a theoretical midpoint which fluctuating actual prices would match exactly only by exception.\n\nIn another interpretation, however, the production price reflects only an empirical output price-level which \"dominates\" in the market for that output (a \"norm\" applying to a branch of production or economic sector, which producers cannot escape from). That is, the prevailing value proportions and necessary labour requirements set a range or band within which product-prices will move. In practice, that means simply that there exists a minimum sale price at which a commodity can be viably and profitably produced; if it is not possible to sell a product at that price, it is unlikely that it will be produced at all.\nBorrowing an idea from Michio Morishima, Anwar Shaikh modelled the formation and change of production prices mathematically using iterative methods to show a convergence of prices and values. The iterative method was first used by George Charasoff in 1910, and subsequently developed by Japanese economists such as Kei Shibata and Nobuo Okishio. \n\nSubsequently, Anwar Shaikh concretized the concept of the production price as the \"regulating price\" dominating the market for a type of product, using the notion of \"regulating capitals\". \n\nSupporters of the Temporal Single System Interpretation, such as Andrew Kliman, believe that Machover's inequality does not really arise, since, if Marx is read correctly, there is no necessity for the value of total inputs to be equal to the value of total outputs, or for inputs and outputs to be valued simultaneously. \n\nIt is certainly true that \"transactions\" can be \"simultaneous\": buyer and seller can get their money or goods at the same time. But the same is not true for \"production\". You cannot produce an output before you have got an input, and once you have bought an input, it takes time to produce an output, which becomes an input to the next cycle of production. The new output is not reducible to the sum of inputs, because it is a new use-value to which new value has been added by living labor. Once the output has been produced and sold, a production price (or a unit cost price) can be fixed \"after the fact\", but that price is based on the preceding capital outlays which are fixed once the output has been produced, plus a profit mark-up, and usually cannot change later (at least not very significantly, in the ordinary situation). \n\nThat aside, in practice it is not really true that every commodity has a uniquely formed production price, as Machover suggests. At best one could say that a \"particular type\" of commodity (for example, a good quality vacuum cleaner) exhibits a normal, average production price. The production price usually applies to the capital value of the whole new output being sold, on which a profit rate is calculated. \n\nThe profit or surplus value component of an individual commodity is rarely in equal proportion to the total profit on the total turnover of that type of commodity. If, for example, the total gross profit mark-up in the unit-cost structure of a packet of butter at the point of sale to the consumer is (say) 45%, that does not mean that the profit rate on the total production capital of the butter producer equals 45%. The butter producer would need to produce and sell a gigantic amount of butter in a very short time, to obtain such a high profit rate on his output. \n\nMcKinsey analysts found that for every $1.00 of operating profit on consumer goods sold in the US in 2008, retailers collected a profit of about $0.31 (down from $0.60 in 1999) while the suppliers, packagers, and others along the value chain behind retail received $0.69. To obtain the same profit as before, fewer retail outlets have to sell many more products, in a shorter time-span. This can lead among other things to the phenomenon of food deserts.\n\nThese readings of Marx imply that traditional interpretations of the transformation problem are really rather meaningless; the apparent mathematical wizardry is based on false interpretations of the concepts involved, and the reciprocal effects of individual actions and aggregate social outcomes is overlooked. Mathematical equations cannot substitute for conceptual precision in the definition of measuring units; they can only reveal the logical and quantitative implications of concepts and measurement units.\n\nAt the beginning of \"Capital, Volume III\", Marx provides a clue to how he thinks the \"transformation problem\" is solved in reality. He implies that it can be solved only by examining capital and profit distributions as a \"dynamic\" process, rather than statically. His argument is, that what industrial competition really revolves around, is principally the difference between the value of the new commodities produced, and their cost-prices, i.e. the potential surplus-value (the trading gain) which can be realized from them. There are constant disparities in space and time between labour-expenditures and capital returns, but also just as constant attempts to overcome or take advantage of those disparities. Thus, unrestricted economic competition has the result that the law of value regulates the trade in newly produced commodities: the ultimate limits of what products will trade for, i.e. their supply price, are set by comparative costs in labour-time.\nIn the real world,\n\nWhen Marx created a simplified, abstract model of profit distributions, he was not primarily trying to prove that the two famous identities (total profit=total surplus value, and total product value=total production price) are compatible with price-value divergences and with profit distributions according to capital employed (to the contrary: for analytical purposes, Marx \"assumes\" that they are compatible). Instead, he was trying to model the basic parameters of business competition for a share of the new surplus-value from the products produced by the working class. By identifying what the business competition is ultimately about, Marx was able to explain both what really motivates the business owners, and why the surface appearance of the business process perceived by an individual is almost the exact inverse of the real economic process in society as a whole.\n\nMuch criticism of Marx's concept originates from the ambiguities referred to earlier. Consequently, many of the criticisms can, according to some Marxists, be dispelled simply by a more exact definition of the cost, product and revenue aggregates used, and of the timing of transactions (see e.g. Temporal Single System Interpretation).\n\nIn doing so, it must be admitted though that Marx's draft manuscript often shows sloppy use of terminology and concepts, and that Marx's purpose was often not fully explicit. At a high level of abstraction, he moves very easily and cavalierly from values to prices and back again, and restricts his discussion of \"capital invested\" to intermediate goods, fixed capital and labour power only. \n\nIt never becomes quite clear how exactly these different ideas can all be easily reconciled, which makes it difficult for academics to understand the intention of Marx's theory. Quite likely Marx would have ironed out inconsistencies if he had prepared his own draft for publication, but he did not do so, leaving his readers with important issues of interpretation.\n\nIn Marx's view, a capitalist production process was a valorisation process in which new value was formed. The theoretical problem was, that this value-forming process - the process vital for capital accumulation - took place mainly \"external to the market\", being bracketed by the transactions M-C (purchase of inputs, C, using money, M) and C'-M' (sales of new output, C', for more money, M'). Between the successive exchanges, however, economic value was \"conserved\", \"transferred\" and \"added to\". Management then tried to estimate the cost and profit implications of different tasks and activities in production for the growth of capital, without full certainty of results.\n\nBut in that case, the domains of product-\"values\" and product-\"prices\", and consequently the domains of value relations and price relations, were \"separate but co-existing and overlapping domains\" (unless one is willing to argue that goods have an economic value only at the point where they are being sold for a price). \"Price management\" was not really possible insofar as prices were determined by markets which individual producers could not control, but \"value-based\" management was possible.\n\nHow could this business reality best be modelled? In contemporary \"value-based management\" by corporations, we can witness a continual cross-reference between past prices, current prices and future prices occurring, because there is practically no other way to do it for business purposes. In the words of group controller Gerard Ruizendaal of Royal Philips Electronics, \n\nA partner of McKinsey & Company comments:\n.In that case, it is \"impossible\" for the sum of input values to be exactly equal to the sum of output values. Indeed, that is exactly what, according to Marx, capitalists are in business for: to invest a sum of capital in production in order to get a \"larger\" sum of capital out of it. In bourgeois theories, value appears spontaneously out of trading activity in the sphere of circulation. The more the market expands and the more buying and selling there is, the more value there is, on this view. For Marx, it is in reality exactly the other way around: the more value workers create for their company, the faster companies can increase their revenues and deploy more capital at attractive rates of return. Marx regarded the prices of production as the \"outward expression\" of the results of a valorisation process in production, and in order to be able to talk about price aggregates at all, he thought reference to \"value relations\" was completely unavoidable.\n\nNot only was a \"value-theoretic principle\" required simply to group prices, relate them and aggregate them (meaning principles of value equivalence, comparable value, value transfer, value conservation, value creation and value used up or destroyed), but most of the stock of labour-products in an economy at any time \"had no actual price\", simply because they weren't being traded. To what extent their value could be realised through exchange in the future could be known definitely only \"after the fact\", i.e. after they were actually sold and paid for. In the meantime, one could only hypothesize about their price, working from previous data. But in the final analysis, the attribution of value to products implied a social relation, without which value relations could not be understood. A community of independent private producers expressed their co-existence and mutual adjustment through the trading prices of their products; how they were socially related was expressed through the forms of value.\n\nThe concept of \"average profit\" (a general profit rate) suggested that a process of competition and market-balancing had \"already established\" a \"uniform (or ruling average, or normal) profit rate\" previously; yet, paradoxically, what profit volumes would be (and consequently profit rates) could be established only \"after\" sales, by deducting costs from gross revenues. An output was produced before it was definitively valued in markets, yet the quantity of value produced affected the total price for which it was sold, and there was a sort of \"working knowledge\" of normal returns on capital. This was a dynamic business reality Marx sought to model in a simple way.\n\nMarx's critics interpreting his models often argue he keeps assuming what he needs to explain, because rather than really \"transforming values into prices\" by some \"quantitative\" mapping procedure, such that prices are truly \"deduced\" from labour-values, he either (1) equates value quantities and price quantities, or else (2) he combines both value quantities and price quantities in one equation. Somewhat confusingly, the cost price refers at one point to the capital advanced (input), and at another point to a component of the value of the new product (output).\n\nThus, for example, either Marx infers a rate of profit from a given capital composition and a given quantity of surplus-value, or else he assumes a rate of profit in order to find the amount of surplus-value applying to a given quantity of capital invested. That might be fine if the aim is to just investigate what profit an enterprise or sector would receive on average, having produced a certain output value with a certain capital composition. But this manoeuvre of itself cannot contain any \"formal proof\" of a necessary quantitative relationship between values and prices, nor a formal proof that capitals of the same size but different compositions (and consequently different expenditures of labour-time) must obtain the same rate of profit. It remains only a theory.\n\nMarx insists both that output prices obtained will necessarily deviate from values produced, but also that the sum of prices would equal to the sum of values in the pure case, yet, critics claim, he fails to show quantitatively how a distribution process could then occur such that price magnitudes map onto value magnitudes, and such that a uniform profit rate returns equal profits to capitals of equal sizes (a \"mapping\" relation is used here in the mathematical sense of a bijective morphism, involving one-to-one correspondence between value quantities and price quantities via mathematical equations). In that case, there is again no formal proof of any necessary relationship between values and prices, and Marx's manuscript really seems an endless, pointless theoretical detour leading nowhere. In modelling, simple logical paradoxes appear of the type that:\n\n\nBeyond paradoxes, stuff just does not add up, unless more assumptions are introduced into Marx's examples, raising the question of which assumptions are legitimate to make, and whether they can solve anything without creating further inconsistencies.\n\nAll the conceptual and logical issues described in the above become crucial when attempts are made to model value and price aggregates mathematically to study capitalist competition. Different kinds of theoretical assumptions or interpretations will obviously lead to very different results.\n\nIn general, many modern Marxists nowadays think that Marx's idea of \"transformation\" was badly misinterpreted. It does not refer to a \"mathematical conversion of values into prices\". After all, constantly shifting product-values and product-prices co-exist side by side all the time according to Marx's theory, and operate in tandem. Rather, the transformation means that the direct regulation of the exchange of commodities according to their value is, in a capitalist mode of production, transformed into the regulation of the exchange of commodities by their production prices - reflecting the fact, that the supply of commodities in capitalist society has become \"conditional\" on the accumulation of capital, and therefore on profit margins and profit rates, within the framework of market competition. Nevertheless, Marx argues that production prices are still determined by underlying product-values (i.e. the average labour requirements for their supply). There is no logical proof available for that argument, only an empirical proof, insofar as there is a close correspondence between the magnitudes of producers' product prices and the magnitudes of labour-time required to produce them, across longer intervals of time (see below).\n\nIf market trade consisted only of simple exchange (the exchange of things of equal value by the direct producers themselves), then balancing production effort, output and demand would be a fairly simple, straightforward matter. But in reality it is not so straightforward precisely \"because\" capitalist market trade is not simple exchange. Production effort, output and demand can be balanced in capitalism, only if sufficient profits are made and the accumulation of capital grows. In reality, products are constantly being sold above or below their value, according to what makes the best possible profit on the turnover, given market fluctuations.\n\nWhatever view one takes on the theoretical issues, no one can evade the (either simultaneous or sequential) \"reciprocal effects\" of individual business behaviour and aggregate economic outcomes. Additionally, it must also be recognised that \"prices\" are not all of one kind; \"actual market prices realised\" are not the same as ideal prices of various kinds, which may be extrapolated from real prices.\n\nA more serious criticism of Marx is that the theory of prices of production is still pitched at a \"far too abstract theoretical level\" to be able to explain anything like specific real price movements. That is, Marx only illustrated with examples the \"general results towards which the competitive process would tend to move\" in capitalism as a social system. He tried to establish what regulates product prices in the \"simplest and purest case\". He believed that if one could not do that, then one could also not explain all the variations from the pure case. He had not however provided a model for accurately predicting \"specific\" price movements. In this regard, it is interesting to study the writings of Michael Porter, in order to see how Marx's original intent relates to modern competitive business practice, and how it might be elaborated on (see further the important studies by Willi Semmler, Christian Bidard, Peter Flaschel, Anwar Shaikh, and Lefteris Tsoulfidis).\n\nSome critics conclude that because Marx fails to \"transform\" value magnitudes into price magnitudes in a way consistent with formal logic, he has not proved value exists, or that it influences prices; in turn, his theory of labour-exploitation must be false. But the validity of Marx's value theory or his exploitation theory may not depend on the validity of his specific transformation procedures, and Marxian scholars indeed often argue that critics mistake what he intended by them. In particular, since value relations - according to Marx - describe the proportionalities between average quantities of labour-time currently required to produce products, value proportions between products exist quite independently of prices (and irrespective of whether goods are currently priced or not). As the structure of product-values changes across time, the structure of prices is likely to change as well, but product-prices will fluctuate above or below product-values and typically respond to changing value proportions only with a certain time lag.\n\nEssentially, the advantage of distinguishing sharply between values and prices in this context is that it enables us to depict the interaction between shifts in product-values and shifts in product-prices as a \"dynamic process of real-world business and market behaviour\", given the reality of different growth rates of supply and demand, i.e. not a study of the conditions for market balance, but a study of the actual process of market balancing occurring with a specific social framework, through successive adjustments which occur in a specific pattern.\n\nArguably \"ideal\" prices could substitute for values in this analysis, but Marx's argument is that product-values will, ontologically speaking, \"really\" exist irrespective of corresponding product-prices, i.e. irrespective of whether product-values are actually being traded, whereas ideal prices do not really exist other than in computations; they are only an hypothetical description. The reason is that product-values refer to empirical quantities of labour-time performed, which are not hypothetical, but an inescapable physical and social reality. This type of analysis paves the way for an important new Marxian criticism of Piero Sraffa's otherwise brilliant critique of capital theory.\n\nIn Sraffian theory, the value of a commodity \"contains\" both the average labour directly involved in making it (\"direct labour\") and past labour contained in the materials from which it is made (\"indirect labour\" or \"dated labour\"). After some pioneering work by various scholars in the 1960s, Luigi Pasinetti provided a methodological foundation for \"measuring\" the labour content of commodities, in this sense, which was developed further by Anwar Shaikh, Eduardo Ochoa, Ed Chilcote, Ara Khanjian and Lefteris Tsoulfidis. \n\nIn Marx's developed theory, however, the value of the commodity represents the average labour \"currently required\" to make it, given the current state of the whole production complex - it is the current social valuation (the replacement cost) of that commodity. This is a synchronic valuation, not a diachronic one. This was not so clearly realized during the 20th century, because economists could not grasp how, in the course of Marx's dialectical story, \"the meaning of the operative concept of value itself\" could undergo some important changes. Because Marx's developed concept of value differs from the simplified concept of value, economists thought that Marx's theory was formally inconsistent.\n\nSome economists and computer scientists, such as Prof. Anwar Shaikh and Dr. Paul Cockshott, argue with statistical evidence that even just a \"93% accurate Ricardian labour theory of value\", is a better empirical predictor of prices than other theories. That is, the only real proofs of Marx theory and its applicability, beyond showing its internal logical consistency, are to be found in the evidence of experience.\n\nWhether more scholars will take up this challenge for research more comprehensively remains to be seen. Mostly, economists have preferred to build abstract mathematical models on the basis of a bunch of assumptions, rather than comprehensively investigate available \"empirical data\" for the purpose of creating an empirically-based theory about economic life. This contrasts with business managers, who have a strongly empirical theory of how business actually works, based on their daily experience of how things go in business.\n\nIt is not difficult to prove a close positive correlation between the value of net output and the labour hours worked to produce it, since the payments which constitute that value, are themselves earnings which are necessarily proportional to time worked and paid for. Even if it is assumed, that gross profits are \"not\" proportional to time worked, by some margin, the total labour-cost involved in the total net output is nevertheless typically more than half of the value of the total net output or gross value added (in the US, labour compensation is nowadays around 55% of the value of total net output).\n\nThe netted totals in the US National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA's) for 2015 show, that annual labour costs were about $9.7 trillion while the total operating surplus or gross profit (net of depreciation) was about $4.5 trillion. In other words, total US labour earnings are twice the size of total gross profit receipts directly generated by production. Since total wage costs are based on time-wages, it is simple math to understand that any measure of the net value added (gross labour compensation + gross profits) which Marx called the value product must \"necessarily\" show a strong positive correlation with the total labour hours worked.\n\nWhat is statistically much more difficult to prove, is the relationship between prices and values in the actual \"distribution\" of net output (a traditional example mentioned, is that while in South Korea workers on average work the most working hours in the world, per capita per year, Korean value-added per capita has been much lower than might be expected; it is not so easy to explain, why this is the case).\n\nA very interesting confirmation of the basic idea that Marx had is provided from a most unexpected source: post-Keynesian economics. After mustering a lot of empirical evidence about pricing practices, the leading heterodox \"real-world\" economist Fred Lee concluded that:\nHowever, a sharp distinction must be drawn between Marx's own theory and subsequent Marxist or Sraffian theories. As Lee emphasizes, \"the typical statement made by Sraffians and Marxists that prices equal their costs of production (which includes a uniform rate of profit) in long-period positions has no conceptual correspondence to the concepts of costs and prices used by business enterprises.\" Consequently, the Marxist and Sraffian theories are not grounded in the real world of business operations, because Marxists and Sraffians confuse a purely abstract model with empirical reality. Fred Lee admits that the magnitude and the relative stability of the profit mark-up for products in modern capitalism \"remains theoretically underexplained in Post Keynesian theory\"\n\nOne possible solution to the \"transformation problem\", largely ignored in the literature, is that Marx tried to sketch a redistribution of value in too simplistic terms, considering the profitability of different production capitals \"in abstraction from the total circuit of capital\".\n\nThe problem that Ricardo failed to solve, was one of how capitals of equal sizes could empirically attract very similar profits, despite empirically manifest unequal expenditures of labour-time. But that problem may be solved more credibly, if we properly consider competition \"in the sphere of capital finance\", i.e. the sphere of credit. In this sense, David Harvey for example mentions that \"the growing power of the credit system in relation to industry also tends to force an equalization of the rate of profit (the connection between profit of enterprise and the interest rate is now very strong).\"\n\nAndrea Salanti stated in 1985 that there is an \"urgent need\" of \"reconsidering the whole methodological foundations of the theory of prices of production\". In his major 2016 treatise on the economics of capitalist production, Anwar Shaikh has indeed overhauled the whole theory of prices of production in the light of empirical evidence, arguing that production prices in the classical sense can only be \"theoretical\" notions, which strictly speaking do not exist in reality. What does exist in real capitalist competition are a type of regulating prices, the dynamics of which he explicates in detail. Shaikh agrees with Keynes and with businesspeople, that what matters financially in business, is the relationship between the real rate of interest on capital and the real rate of profit on capital (at the micro level of individual firms and at the macro-level of aggregated business results).\n\nAccording to statistical calculations by Shaikh and Tsoulfidis, the discrepancies between the different empirical measures of product-values, prices of production, regulating prices and market prices which are feasible (using input-output data, labour data and capital stock data) turn out to be, on the whole, not very large. This suggests that the enormously long Marxist debate about the relationship between product-values and product-prices was, in a sense, unwarranted; overall, the differences between average product-prices and the underlying product-values are, as far as can be established, just not very great. And if the price/value differences are not very great, then Marx was quite justified in mostly disregarding them in \"Capital, Volume I\" and \"Capital, Volume II\". Had Marxists been able to measure price-value relationships of products empirically, earlier on in the controversy, they might not have given the issue so much weight; but the econometric techniques to do it were perfected only from the 1980s onward. However, the validity of econometric techniques to measure price-value deviations are still in dispute.\n\nShaikh largely side-steps a more precise conceptual discussion of the relationship between Marxian \"values\" and the forms of prices as such, preferring to demonstrate a strong positive correlation between movements in labour requirements and movements in actual price-levels for outputs. His analysis suggests, that the real dynamics of capitalist competition in the sphere of production are indeed remarkably similar to how Smith, Ricardo and then Marx originally described them, even although Marx's theory must be elaborated and modified to complete the classical theory, so that it is fully consistent and can properly explain the economic facts.\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the most distinctive cacti, a member of the relatively small genus \"Stenocereus\". It is endemic to the central Pacific coast of Baja California Sur, and is found only on sandy soils, where it forms massive colonies.\n\nAs with all cacti, creeping devil is succulent, and is reported to contain mescaline and sterols. Growth patterns can be widely scattered as individual stems; in favorable localities they can form impenetrable patches of branching stems measuring several metres across. The creeping devil is columnar, with a very spiny stem which is creamy green in color, averaging 5 cm in diameter and 1.5–2 m long, with only the terminal end raised from the ground. A height of 20–30 cm is normal since this cactus is recumbent (it grows in a horizontal manner). The large, nocturnal flowers are white, pink, or yellow; usually 10–14 cm long with a spiny ovary, and flowering sparingly in response to rain. The spiny fruit is 3–4 cm long with black seeds.\n\nCreeping devil lies on the ground and grows at one end while the other end slowly dies, with a succession of new roots developing on the underside of the stem. The growth rate is adapted to the moderate, moist marine environment of the Baja peninsula, and can achieve in excess of 60 cm per year, but when transplanted to a hot, arid environment the cacti can grow as little as 60 cm per decade. Over the course of many years, the entire cactus will slowly travel, with stems branching and taking root toward the growing tips, while older stem portions die and disintegrate. This traveling chain of growth gives rise to the name \"eruca\", which means \"caterpillar\" as well as the common name creeping devil.\n\n\"Stenocereus eruca\" is considered the \"most extreme case of clonal propagation in the cactus family\" (Gibson and Nobel, 1986). This means that due to isolation and scarcity of pollinating creatures, the plant is able to clone itself. This is done by pieces detaching from the major shoot as their bases die and rot.\n\nOther members of this genus that are found in the Baja Peninsula of California are \"Stenocereus thurberi\" (organpipe cactus, pitaya dulce) and \"Stenocereus gummosus\" (sour pitaya, pitaya agria, pitayha). While once thought to be threatened with extinction, further evidence showed it not to be so. Transplantation, while not recommended due to environmentally specific factors, can be done successfully with strict adherence to maintaining conditions which mirror the native environment.\n\n"}

The annual Bidlake Memorial Prize, was instituted in his memory. He was a timekeeper in cycling, motorcycling and for seaplane races in the 1930s.\n\nBidlake favoured the tricycle, winning championships and setting national records, often beating bicycle riders. In 1893, he set a 24-hour tricycle record of at Herne Hill velodrome in south London. It still stood when he died. At one time, he held all national tricycle records from to 24-hour, plus place-to-place records, and records on the tandem tricycle.

The position of cycle racing was still less certain. The custom was for racers to shelter behind pacers, whose job was to \"bring on\" their riders, in the phrase of the time. On 21 July 1894, Bidlake was one of 50 in a race on the main road north out of London. He and another rider, Arthur Ilsley, and their two pacers, were passing a woman with a horse when the horse reared and both riders crashed into a ditch.\n\nThe greatest damage was to the bicycles but the woman complained to Huntingdonshire police that such races should not take place. The National Cyclists Union, fearing action in Huntingdonshire could spread across the country and lead to another attempt to amend the Highways Act, banned its clubs from racing on the road and ordered them to compete on the track instead.\n\nNot all riders lived near a track or wished to race there. They set up a rival body, the Road Racing Council, and on 5 October 1895 Bidlake was one of the members of the North Road club who organised a race against the clock. Les Bowerman, who researched this and races that followed, said:\n\nThe fact, as Bowerman says, there were unpaced races against the clock before the North Road event in October 1895 means Bidlake can not, as he often is, be described as the founder of time-trialling. Bernard Thompson, a historian of British time-trialling, wrote:\n\nBut he was among those who codified a sport which became the leading part of British cycle-racing, even though its officials were so uncertain of their creation that they refused to tell the police, referred to courses and dates in code, held their races in the country at dawn, demanded riders dress completely in black, and banned even the sport's own press from saying when races would be held. Lists of competitors were headed \"private and confidential\" until the 1960s.\n\nBidlake's organisation started as a rebellion from the ruling of the National Cyclists Union but it soon became an established part of cycling authority.\n\nBidlake's time-trialling was a rebel's exercise against the dictates of the National Cyclists' Union, but in time the two parts of the sport collaborated. Both agreed that massed racing on the road was undesirable and placed all cyclists at risk. The Isle of Man, which being outside the United Kingdom was not subject to the NCU's ban nor in fear of British police, was proposed in 1914 as the site of a world championship road race.\n\n\"Cycling\" quoted Bidlake as calling massed racing – the sort now seen in the Tour de France – \"a superfluous excrescence.\" He continued: \"Unpaced solitary speedmen perform magnificently, unobtrusively, with no obstructive crowds and give no offence. I can't believe that our road men want to alter all this to make a Manxman's holiday.\"\n\nThe First World War ended the idea.\n\nBidlake also objected to the way women had begun to wear knickerbockers to ride a bicycle. He said: \"A skirtless lady on tour is bound to suffer much. She is singularly conspicuous, a centre of observation and exposed to such contumelious ridicule as the ordinary sensitive feminine nature hesitates to provoke.\". Women who wore other than skirts to ride a bicycle called what they wore Rational Dress. Bidlake ridiculed it in Cycling as Laughable Dress. When the Cyclists' Touring Club defended a woman member turned away from a hotel because she was wearing it, Bidlake insisted that the CTC was defending not the outfit but the CTC's contract with the hotel to serve any member of the club.\n\nOf women racing, he said:\n\nBidlake took an interest in motor sports and timed a motorcycling attempt on the Land's End to John o'Groats record by George Pilkington Mills, who already held the record on a bicycle and a tricycle. An undated news cutting says: \"Mr G.P. Mills on his Raleigh motorcycle completed his run from Land's End to John o'Groats on Saturday forenoon and established a new record. He started on his long and trying journey at eight on Thursday morning, and arrived at his destination at 11 am on Saturday, after being 50h 46m 30s on the road. Mr F.T. Bidlake was the timekeeper. Mr J. Silver previously held the record, having done the distance in 64h 29m, and Mr E.H. Arnott in 65h 45m. He has not only beaten the motor cycle record, but is also nearly two hours ahead of best motor car time.\"\n\nHe was a timekeeper for the Royal Aero Club and in the Schneider Trophy seaplane races of the 1930s.\n\nThe magazine \"Cycling\" created its \"Golden Book of Cycling\" in 1933 to record those whose contributions to the sport it considered outstanding. That year, 7,000 cyclists at the Royal Albert Hall in London watched Bidlake sign the first page during a concert to honour time-trialling champions. It was the last time most saw him alive.\n\nBidlake was riding down Barnet Hill, north of London, on Sunday 27 August 1933, when he was hit by a car. His injuries looked superficial and he managed to get home. But he lapsed into semi-consciousness and died on 17 September. By this time, a testimonial fund had been established. It became a memorial fund. \n\nA garden and monument, at Girtford Bridge near Sandy in Bedfordshire, was unveiled on 23 September 1934. More than 4,000 watched as W. P. Cook, president of the Anfield Bicycle Club and the Road Records Association, performed the unveiling ceremony. The rector of Sandy blessed the memorial. The garden is triangular with a wall of local stone on one side. In its centre, a stone reads: “This garden is dedicated to Frederick Thomas Bidlake, a great cyclist, a man of singular charm and character, an untiring worker for cyclists 1867–1933”. A sundial in the centre of the garden is marked “He measured time”. A facsimile milestone is engraved “F. T. B. Few have known this road as he. London 48 – York 148”.\n\nThe balance of the fund was used to create an annual award – the Bidlake Memorial Prize – for the most outstanding performance or contribution to cycling. Several achievements during the 1950s were not marked by the committee, primarily because they involved riders from the breakaway British League of Racing Cyclists. Significant events overlooked included Brian Robinson's first British stage victory in the Tour de France in 1958 and Ian Steel's victory in the 1952 Peace Race.\n\nWinners of the award include:\n\nBidlake's correspondence and other papers are at the National Cycle Archive at the University of Warwick.\n\n"}

Billed as \"The African Adventure\", the park included drive-through animal enclosures, aviaries, a dolphinarium and minor theme park rides.\n\nThe park's drive-through enclosures featured lions, tigers, bears, cheetahs and baboons. In addition, the park had a Serengeti zone (featuring camels, llamas, giraffes, zebras and buffalo), an elephant enclosure, a hippo lake, chimpanzees, birds of prey, parrots and butterflies. The park closed in 1992.\n\nBilly Smart Sr. bought the St.Leonard's Estate in the mid 1960s. After his death, the Royal Windsor Safari Park was founded in 1969 by his sons, the Smart brothers: Billy Smart, Jr., David Smart and Ronald Smart. Built on St Leonards Hill in Windsor in Berkshire, England, the 144 ac estate of rolling parkland and known as the St Leonards Estate included a 110-room country house owned by the American Horace Elgin Dodge Jr (son of Horace Elgin Dodge of Dodge Motor Cars) and occupied by the Kennedy Family during World War II, when JFK's father was US ambassador to the UK.\nA key attraction at Windsor Safari Park was Seaworld, a dolphinarium complex housing dolphins, a killer whale, penguins and sea lions, performing acrobatic displays for members of the public.\n\nWindsor Safari Park was proactive in dolphin research and conservation, employing many wildlife experts and academics. Research efforts included the development of a fishing net warning system for dolphins and the Dolphin Research Project aimed to raise funds for other research on sonar communication and behaviour.\n\nThe Safari Park owed its success in part to the natural roaming habitats that had been created for lions, tigers, cheetahs and baboons. A Serengeti zone was also added (featuring camels, llamas, giraffes, zebras and buffalo), an elephant enclosure, a hippo lake, and a monkey jungle.\n\nThe first job of the financier Robert Hanson was in the 1970s as an assistant keeper of reptiles at the Safari Park.\n\nThe Safari Park attracted up to 2.5 million visitors per annum, from when it opened. It grew significantly throughout the 1970s and 1980s and was eventually sold to Themes International in 1988. The new owners planned to develop an African-themed park introducing themed eateries and games and attractions such as the African Queen Riverboat Ride.\n\nThemes International invested £11m developing the business but, after nine years, ran into financial difficulties. The Windsor business, in particular, had experienced dwindling visitor numbers, and the situation was exacerbated by the early 1990s recession and the cost of building an expensive new Egyptian-themed entrance courtyard and similarly themed market streets.\n\nThemes International and the Safari Park entered receivership in January 1992, with debts of £40m and closed shortly afterwards; the expensive new developments were left largely unused.\n\nThe park was purchased soon afterwards by the Lego Group, whose ambition was to create a Legoland theme park similar to the existing Legoland in Billund, Denmark. The resulting Legoland Windsor opened in 1996.\n\nThe dolphins were relocated to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands.\n\nThe only attraction that remains from the Safari Park days (aside from the mansion) is the gauge funicular railway, now known as the \"Hill Train\", which links The Beginning area of the park to the centre of the park between NINJAGO World and Kingdom of the Pharaohs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2219450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219450", "title": "Simón Iturri Patiño", "text": "Simón Iturri Patiño\n\nSimón Iturri Patiño (1 June 1862 – 20 April 1947) was a Bolivian industrialist who was among the world's wealthiest people at the time of his death. With a fortune built from ownership of a majority of the tin industry in Bolivia, Patiño was nicknamed \"The Andean Rockefeller\". During World War II, Patiño was believed to be one of the five wealthiest men in the world.\n\nPatiño's biographers are not in agreement on the details of his early life. Many wrote that he was a cholo, with a mixed Quechua and Spanish heritage, and born to a poor mother, while his authorized biography holds that he was solely of European ancestry, and the son of a provincial leader. He was actually the illegitimate son of Eugénio Iturri, a Basque, and María Patiño, from Cochabamba. Before entering the mining industry, he either managed a store in Oruro, or spent years in private schools.\n\nEventually, Patiño started in mining with Compañía Hunanchaca de Bolivia, a silver company, and then with Fricke y Compañía. Patiño was assigned to collections for the store, and in 1894, he agreed to accept a deed of land in compromise for a $250 debt owed by a prospector. The deed turned out to be for the rocky side of a mountain, and Patiño was fired from his job for settling an account in exchange for a worthless piece of property. Legend has it that Patiño was forced to pay back the store from his own funds, and was stuck with his own bad bargain.\n\nThe mountain, located near Llallagua, turned out to be richer in minerals than anyone had imagined. Although the first several years of work yielded little, the turning point came in 1900 when Patiño located a very rich vein of tin, later called \"\"La Salvadora\"\" (The Savior). Over the next 10 years he built up the control of nearby mines and other important mines in Bolivia, including Catavi, Siglo XX, Uncia and Huanuni. By the 1920s he had also bought out Chilean interests in his mining company and went on to buy tin smelters in England and Germany. By the 1940s he controlled the international tin market and was one of the wealthiest men in the world, hence his \"title\" \"The Tin King\" (\"Rey del Estaño\").\n\nIn his 2008 book \"Outliers,\" Malcolm Gladwell estimated the total net worth of Simon I. Patiño around USD 81.2 billion in 2008 dollars. That amount placed him in number 26 of all time wealthiest individuals in human history, ahead of Bill Gates, Carlos Slim, Warren Buffett and J.P. Morgan.\n\nPatiño had been living between Europe and Bolivia since around 1912. In 1924, following a heart attack, his doctors told him not to return to Bolivia and he moved abroad permanently, first to Paris, then to New York and finally to Buenos Aires where he died, close to the homeland he was so fond of and wanted so desperately to return to. While living in Paris he was appointed Minister to France and represented Bolivia in 1938 at the Évian Conference.\n\nPatiño is without doubt the greatest industrialist Bolivia has ever had. His substantial wealth made him powerful in Bolivian politics and he was locally both admired and hated.\n\nPrevious to a political shift away from his allies in the government Patiño merged the company owning his Bolivian tin property with a British company active in Malaysia.\n\nPatiño died in 1947 and was buried in the province of Cochabamba, high in the Bolivian mountains of his birth, in a white mausoleum.\n\nSimón I. Patiño was married to Albina Rodriguez, with whom he had five children\n\nSome of the Patiños now reside on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nThe Bolivian Revolution of 1952 confiscated the \"Patiño Mines\". It is claimed that Patiño's son, Antenor Patiño, had a hand in the military coup that deposed the leader of that revolution, the then President Víctor Paz Estenssoro, in the 1960s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2219469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219469", "title": "Watermans Bay, Western Australia", "text": "Watermans Bay, Western Australia\n\nWatermans Bay is a northern coastal suburb of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.\n\nThe area originally formed part of the Hamersley Estate, which also included the suburbs now known as Carine, North Beach and modern-day Hamersley. These areas were owned by the Hamersley family, who arrived from Europe to settle in the Swan River Colony in 1837. The Hamersleys built a summer home just south of Waterman called \"The Castle\" in 1865, where their large family, as well as the Perth elite, congregated for summer holidays. Many of the street names in the suburb honour members of the Hamersley family, including Ethel, Margaret, Mary, Ada and Elsie.\n\nOriginally set aside as a timber reserve, the area was first settled by pastoralists in the 1860s. It served as a stopping point and watering hole along the Coastal Stock Route between Dongara and Fremantle. Cattle drovers frequented the area and Afghan camel drivers were a common sight after the opening of the goldfields in the 1890s.\n\nIn 1908, the first house in modern-day Watermans Bay was built by a business man come recreational fisherman, Alfred Waterman, who named his house \"Zephyr\". The beach front adjacent to his house became known as Watermans Bay, which became a popular fishing spot. The only way into the area at this time was via a wooden block road built by convicts (later Wanneroo Road) and then along a limestone track to North Beach, although numerous tracks through the bushland were developed as time progressed.\n\nIn 1918, the area was subdivided as the Mt Flora Estates, but initial development was largely limited to holiday shacks. After World War II, the area developed rapidly, and in 1954, the postal district of Watermans Bay was approved. By 1961, nearly all of the existing suburb had been built and settled.\n\nIn 1962, the name Watermans Bay was shortened to Waterman because it did not comply with WA state government regulations at the time it was not, strictly speaking, a bay. This move was unpopular with local residents, who lobbied to revert the name. In November 2003, the Geographic Names Committee accepted a City of Stirling proposal to return to the original name following a survey of Waterman households, 491 of whom supported the proposal and 11 of whom opposed it.\nIt is in fact a \"bay\", divided by onshore cliffs and offshore reefs to north and south with a wide sandy beach, and a place to launch fishing boats.\nStar Swamp Bushland Reserve is a bushland reserve occupying about half of the land area of the suburbs of Watermans Bay and North Beach. The precise origin of the name is unknown, but the earliest known use of the name was on a lease application by J.H.Okely of Wanneroo in 1868. \nIt also has a long history as a Noongar camping area, with fresh water and abundant bush tucker and seafood. Some signs of the people are still there. \nIn 1987, the State Government set aside 96 hectares as an A-class reserve, and funding from the Bicentennial Commemorative Program and assistance from local organisations facilitated the establishment of the Star Swamp Heritage Trail within the reserve.\n\nWatermans Bay is bounded by the Beach Road coastal segment to the north, Marmion Avenue to the east, Hale Street to the south and West Coast Drive and the ocean to the west. Star Swamp sits east of Hope Street and represents just over half of the suburb. Reid Highway ends at the southeastern corner, and is the suburb's outlet to the Mitchell Freeway and the Perth central business district.\n\nAt the 2006 Australian census, Waterman had a population of 1,195 people living in 494 dwellings, with an average age of 45 years (the third-oldest in the northern suburbs). Residential styles in Watermans Bay range from timber and fibro workers' homes to modern two storey dwellings constructed of brick. Due to its small size and surroundings, it is one of the most expensive of the northern suburbs in Perth.\n\nWatermans Bay is a residential suburb, relying on a shop on West Coast Drive and nearby shops in Marmion, North Beach and Duncraig for basic commercial services, and nearby Karrinyup Shopping Centre for other services. The suburb contains no schools, but Marmion Primary School is just beyond its northern boundary.\n\nStar Swamp Bushland Reserve is accessible from the eastern edge of the suburb. The WA Marine Research Laboratories are located on the beach off Elvire Street, and until recently were the headquarters of the Research Division of the WA Department of Fisheries, which moved to Hillarys in June 2005. The site has since become the home of the department's International Operations Branch.\n\nOn the southern boundary, on Elvire Street, is the Mount Flora Regional Museum, built in 1936 as a water tower at the highest point of the suburb to provide scheme water to surrounding areas. It was phased out of service in the 1970s, and converted to a museum and lookout in May 1986. It now details the region's history, and is home to the North Suburban Historical Society.\n\nWatermans Bay is served by the 423 bus route between Warwick and Stirling train stations, operated by Swan Transit.\n\nWatermans Bay is a reasonably affluent suburb with a large elderly population. It consistently supports the Liberal Party at both federal and state elections.\n\n"}

{"id": "2219484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219484", "title": "Perl Object Environment", "text": "Perl Object Environment\n\nThe Perl Object Environment or POE is a library of Perl modules written in the Perl programming language by Rocco Caputo et al. \n\nFrom CPAN:\n\nPOE, The Perl Object Environment can be thought of as a tiny modular operating system. One or more POE programs or instances can be run concurrently and are generally well suited for cooperative multitasking. The POE package consists of namespaces and abstractions that guide future development of POE in an open-ended CPAN-style convention.\n\nThe informal architecture consists of a set of layers with a kernel on the bottom. This tiny kernel represents the events layer which operates as the main loop of each running POE instance. The first call is to the \"event dispatcher\" - POE::Kernel.\n\nThe POE::Kernel namespace contains a suite of functions which are plugged into the kernel itself. These loop abstractions are designed after POE's standardized event loop bridge interface - POE::Loop. These can be mixed and matched as needed to provide runtime services and a lean facility for interprocess communication. The basic functions are POE::Loop::Event, POE::Loop::Poll and POE::Loop::Select. Also available are POE::Loop::Tk and POE::Loop::Gtk which offer hooks into other loop bridges in the external environment. If that isn't enough, the POE::Loop kernel abstraction provides reusable signal callbacks, time or alarm callbacks, and filehandle activity callbacks as well as administrative functions such as initializing, executing, and finalizing event loops.\n\nThere is also a higher level packaging framework - POE::Macro and a debugging utility for testing them called POE::Preprocessor. This framework has yielded POE::Macro::UseBytes. \n\nAlways check CPAN to see what new goodies the community has placed in the archive. \n\nThe Running Kernel operates through primordial finite state machines constructed from another set of abstractions ruled by the POE::Session architecture. A POE::Session is almost trivially defined as a map of events to the functions, class methods, and/or object methods that handle them. POE::Session objects also contain a storage space shared by all its event handlers, called a heap. Any way you slice them the states are solidly identified and clearly defined.\n\nA more featureful event handler is a POE::Session subclass called POE::NFA - an event-driven Nondeterministic finite Automaton (a \"smarter\" finite state machine). This event handler moves from one strictly defined state to another as events, polls, user selections, or other external events require. This state machine acts to encapsulate a wide range of generic event driven threads allowing much tighter tracking along the execution path than the relatively informal POE::Session.\n\nThe Kernel's next requirement is for Input-Output handlers that exist in a single I/O layer called \"Wheels\". Wheels initiate actions, handle their resulting low-level events, and produce higher-level events for the sessions that use them. Wheels, like Sessions and Loops are built from a uniform set of abstractions - POE::Wheel - that sit on top of the Kernel. There are seven highly specialized and well-defined Wheels in POE's base distribution:\n\nDrivers do the actual work of reading and writing filehandles. They are built according to the less abstract definitions contained in the POE::Driver module. The main driver implemented at the time of this writing is POE::Driver::SysRW - a universal filehandle reader/writer designed especially for POE::Wheel::ReadWrite.\n\nThe next layer, built from POE::Filter and probably the focus of most Perl Obfuscation Efficianados (see POE #POE Humor below), is the POE::Filter set: \n\nsee POE at CPAN for the complete list\n\nSeveral larger packages have been written in POE according to the POE::Component documentation. These are event-driven modules, many of which act as little daemons that provide services to larger packages to which they belong. Some of them facilitate higher-level communications between modules, especially stand-alone applications that need to remain independent from the main distribution of Perl.\n\nIn general, POE Components are ready-made high level procedures that perform specific large tasks. A few examples:\n\n \"POE Components tend to be highly reusable libraries that handle tedious tasks,\n\n\n\n"}

A self-described terrorist from the age of 16, she was known widely by her nickname, Marusya. Through her exploits she became a renowned figure in the anarchist movement of 1918–1919 in Ukraine during Russian Civil War.\n\nBorn in Alexandrovsk (now Zaporizhia), Ukraine, in 1885, Maria's father was an officer and hero of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. At the age of 16, she left home and became a babysitter, sales clerk, and ultimately a factory worker, with a position of bottle washer in a vodka distillery. She joined a local group of anarcho-communists.\n\nShe adopted a strategy of \"motiveless terrorism\" (bezmotivny terror), staging a number of bombings and expropriation missions, including bank robberies. In 1907 she was captured, her involvement in these activities leading to a death sentence, later commuted to life imprisonment. She served part of her sentence in the Petropavlovsk prison in St. Petersburg, before being exiled to Siberia in 1910. From there she escaped to Japan. She went from there to the United States, then Spain, and finally arrived in Paris. By 1913 she had become well known by a nickname, Marusya, a Slavic diminutive form of \"Maria\", though when or how she acquired the name is not known.. She was very familiar with it, using it as a signature and was addressed by strangers with it. In Paris, she married Witold Brzostek, a Polish anarchist and friend, as a matter of convenience. With the outbreak of World War I, she sided with Peter Kropotkin's anti-German position, in favor of the Allied powers. She applied and graduated from a French officer college, serving in the Macedonian Front. \n\nWith the outbreak of the Russian revolution, she abandoned France and returned to Petrograd. In the city, she organized and spoke at pro-anarchist rallies in Kronstadt. In the summer of 1917, with anti-anarchist activity within the Russian Provisional Government on the rise, Maria escaped back to her home town in Alexandrovsk, Ukraine. Once there, she organized a fighting force of anarchist Black Guards under her command to terrorize the city's authorities, in particular army officers and landlords who refused to cooperate with peasant efforts to redistribute wealth. Alexandrovsk's nationalist government struggled to maintain order under the subversive actions of leftists in general, and anarchists in particular, who exercised political control and popular support to exclude the influence of the Central Rada and redistribute private property.\n\nWhen the October Revolution took place in Russian Empire, leftist-dominated cities such as Huliaipole were already teetering on open civil war. There, anarchists gained strength by appealing to peasant enthusiasm for revolution. Upon the invasion of Ukraine by the Red Army, the soviet of the small city issued a decree calling for fighters to join the invasion to overthrow the Ukrainian nationalists. Hundreds of men, mostly anarchists, formed a Black Guard under Nestor Makhno and his brother Sava, and marched on Alexandrovsk. Under siege by advancing Red Army forces to the north, Makhno's anarchists to the east, and subversion by Nikiforova's Black Guards from within, the nationalist army retreated from the city on January 15, 1918. The city shortly came under Bolshevik control. Makhno's forces arrived within days, altering the balance of power in the anarchist's favor.\n\nWith Alexandendrovsk secured, Nikiforova and her new ally, Nestor Makhno, held a meeting with the Bolsheviks. Backed by their Black Guards, the duo negotiated to become anarchist representatives in the city's new Revolutionary committee. At the beginning, Maroussia and Makhno have allied her on common grounds of anarchism, and later Maroussia has begun to accuse Nestor of ignoring the anarchist ideas. \"She called him for a bloody struggle against the exploiters and Ukrainian nationalism\"\n\nNikiforova was appointed to the position of assistant deputy, but within weeks Makhno stepped down in dissatisfaction with the group's lack of radicalism. The pair would operate independently as military commanders in the future, but worked closely and often pooled resources in pursuing an anarchist revolution. Makhno historian, Michael Palij, noted that Nikiforova \"exercised a substantial influence upon Makhno from the very beginning of their acquaintance\".\n\nIn the summer of 1917, anarchists unofficially held economic power in Huliaipole, though this was due to underground activity, as officially power rested with the Bolshevik backed soviet in the city \nIn August 1917, Nikiforova seized and robbed a military storehouse at Orikhiv, subsequently attacking, disarming and dispersing the town's regiment and executing all officers captured. However, rather than pass these spoils to the Red Army, they were delivered to Makhno and his own Black Guards. This signaled the end of Nikiforova's loyalty to the committee and Bolsheviks, though she would continue to ally with the Red Army occasionally in battle.\n\nShe later established a new Black Guard detachment in the other cities, including Elisavetgrad.\n\nIn December 1917, her Black Guards helped to establish Soviet power in eastern Ukraine cities of Kharkiv and Yekaterinoslav, as well as Aleksandrovsk. In thanks, the Bolshevik commander in the region, Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, gave her funds to upgrade her detachment, which became known as the \"Free Combat Druzhina\". This unit was active in fighting the Whites Guards, the Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Germans-Austro-Hungarians over a large area of southern Ukraine. She was instrumental in establishing Soviet power in the city of Yelizavetgrad (today Kropyvnytskyi) and later was involved in bloody battles in quelling a right-wing revolt in the city. In April 1918, she received a commendation from Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko for her revolutionary activities.\n\nThe Free Combat Druzhina was equipped with two large guns and an armoured flatcar. The wagons were loaded with armoured cars, tachankas, and horses as well as troops which meant that the detachment was by no means restricted to railway lines. The trains were festooned with banners reading \"The Liberation of the Workers is the Affair of the Workers Themselves\", \"Long Live Anarchy\", \"Power Breeds Parasites\", and \"Anarchy is the Mother of Order.\"\n\nThe soldiers were better fed and equipped than many of the Red Army units. Although there were no official uniforms, the soldiers certainly had a sense of style. Long hair (not common in that era), sheepskin caps, officers' service jackets, red breeches, and ammunition belts were much in evidence. The Druzhina was composed of a core of militants devoted to Marusya and a larger group which came and went on a fairly casual basis. The militants included a fair number of Black Sea sailors, noted for their fighting qualities throughout Ukraine.\n\nWith their black flags and cannons, Marusya's echelons resembled pirate ships sailing across the Ukrainian steppe. One observer, the Left-SR I. Z. Steinberg, compared the trains to the Flying Dutchman, liable to appear at any time, anywhere. Travelling in echelons, the Druzhina advanced to meet the enemy, which in January 1918, meant the White Guards and the Ukrainian Central Rada.\n\nNikiforova was put on the trial twice by the Bolsheviks on charges of insubordination and pillaging: in Taganrog in April 1918 and in Moscow in January 1919. She was acquitted at the first trial, where witnesses were present to speak in her defense. Antonov-Ovseyenko also telegraphed a letter in support of her, commending her revolutionary activities in aid to the Bolsheviks. At the second, she was unable to launch a legal defense, and was banned from holding a political post for a year. Returning to Ukraine, she traveled to Huliaipole, now an autonomous area under Nestor Makhno's anarchist control, dubbed the Free Territory. Unwilling to damage his alliance with the Red Army, Makhno refused to disobey the sentence and would not appoint her to a position in his Black Army, the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. Unable to command a fighting force for, she worked alongside Makhno by making public speeches, and organizing propaganda events.\n\nAntonov-Ovseenko recalled meeting her on April 28, 1919, while reviewing Makhno's troops and the city of Gulyai-Polye (Huliaipole). \"Makhno introduces the members of the Gulyai-Polye soviet's executive committee and of his staff. Also there is the political commissar of the bridge, my old acquaintance, Marussia Nikiforova.\" Seeking to clarify rumors of corruption and counter-revolutionary activity among Makhno's ranks and the soviet of the city, Antonov-Ovseenko wrote glowingly of his impression of Gulyai-Polye. His report intrigued prominent Bolsheviks, who decided to visit the city personally. Lev Kamenev and a delegation of Ukrainian politicians, arrived by armored train a week following Antonov-Ovseenko visit, on May 7. Nikiforova met them at the train station, and with other members of Makhno's staff, Boris Veretelnikov and Mikhalev-Pavlenko, offered to escort them into the city. After meeting Makhno and touring the city, Kamenev was impressed with Nikiforova, and upon returning to Ekaterinoslav, he telegraphed Moscow officials. He ordered that her sentence be reduced, from a year, to \"six months deprivation of the right to hold responsible posts.\" However, given the overwhelmingly anti-anarchist propaganda among Bolshevik commanders, politicians, and media, Antonov-Ovseenko's attempts to lobby for military support for the anarchists faltered. His political power declined, and he was replaced within weeks of his visit, on June 15, by Jukums Vācietis.\n\nIn June 1919, Makhno's anarchist armies were outlawed by the Bolshevik command, and came under attack. Facing a two-front war against the white and red armies, Maria gathered a group of fighters, and reunited with her husband Witold Brzostek. Her intention was to field terrorist cells, as a formal fighting force was no longer available. Dispatching three cells on various missions, she took part in a sabotage mission against the White movement in the city of Sevastopol. There she and Bzhostek were recognized and arrested. Tried on September 16, 1919, she and her husband were found guilty and sentenced to death. Both were shot.\n\nIn her youth, Nikiforova entered anarcho-communist politics and adopted militant tactics to pursue them. Throughout her years of activism, Nikiforova gave numerous speeches espousing her political opinions. However, transcriptions and quotes from her speeches scarcely survived the Soviet era, and she was not known to write her views in letters, essays, or articles. What is known of her speeches is that she was widely regarded for her charismatic oratory, which she used to expound anarchist views. Widely known as an anarchist, she was said to constantly wear entirely black clothing as a symbol of her libertarian philosophy.\n\nDuring times of revolution, she favored immediate and complete redistribution of property owned by wealthy land owners, declaring, \"The workers and peasants must, as quickly as possible, seize everything that was created by them over many centuries and use it for their own interests.\"\n\nHowever, while she constantly spoke in favor of anarchist philosophy, she warned against vanguardism and elitism, insisting that anarchists could not guarantee positive social change. \"The anarchists are not promising anything to anyone.\" She cautioned, \"The anarchists only want people to be conscious of their own situation and seize freedom for themselves.\"\n\nWhile living in exile in Paris, she sided with Peter Kropotkin on the issue of World War I, favoring the Allies in opposition to the German Empire. She graduated from French military school at the officer rank and served in the army.\n\nUpon returning to Russia in 1917, Nikiforova was influenced by Apollon Karelin, a veteran anarchist who advocated a tactical strategy of \"Soviet anarchism.\" Meeting her in Petrograd, Karelin's political tactics encouraged anarchist participation in Soviet institutions with the long term plan of directing them towards an anarchist agenda, provided these institutions did not deviate from revolutionary goals. In the event that they deviated from a radical agenda, anarchists were to rebel against them. Such institutional cooperation was widely disliked among anarchists, as they were largely a minority within such institutions, rendering their activity ineffectual.\n\nNikiforova agreed to ally with the Bolsheviks under special circumstances and negotiated to have herself appointed to a soviet institution, briefly becoming the Deputy leader of the Alexandrovsk revkom. She would go on to help establish footholds for Soviet power in several Ukrainian cities, demanding material support from Bolshevik agents in return, which she then used to pursue her anarchist agenda. Although she would ally herself with the Red Army on multiple occasions, she was constantly at odds with their commanders and personally antagonized several, arguing against some their practices on revolutionary grounds. Upon discovering that a Soviet commander was hoarding luxury goods looted from an aristocrat's home, she angrily confronted him for his selfishness. \"The property of the estate owners doesn't belong to any particular detachment,\" she declared \"but to the people as a whole. Let the people take what they want.\"\n\nFollowing Nikiforova's death, several publications described her in terms which placed emphasis on her supposed unattractiveness. Chudnov, a former Makhnovist, wrote of her when recalling a 1918 meeting: \"This was a woman of 32 – 35, medium height, with an emaciated, prematurely aged face in which there was something of a eunuch or hermaphrodite. Her hair was cropped short in a circle.\" Years after meeting her in 1919, Aleksei Kiselyov described her in his memoirs: \"Around 30 years old. Thin with an emaciated face, she produced the impression of an old maid type. Narrow nose. Sunken cheeks. She wore a blouse and skirt and a small revolver hung from her belt.\" Kiselev also alleged that she was a cocaine addict. Nikiforova biographer, Malcolm Archibald, noted that most Bolshevik writers described her in ways similar to this, and hypothesized that this was part of an effort to discredit her ideas with ad hominem attacks. \"One suspects the Bolshevik memoirists, finding her ideology unattractive, tried to make her external appearance ugly as well.\"\n\nDescriptions of Nikiforova fall into two general categories, either highlighting an alleged repulsiveness, or beauty. An exception to the majority of Bolshevik descriptions, Raksha recalled his 1918 meeting with her in very positive terms: \"I had heard that she was a beautiful woman... Marusya was sitting at a table and had a cigarette in her teeth. This she-devil really was a beauty: about 30, gypsy-type with black hair and a magnificent bosom which filled out her military tunic.\"\n\nThroughout her life, Nikiforova had been wounded multiple times, or had been mistaken for dead, only to reappear in good health later. Due to her reputation within folklore, rumors spread in the months following her death that she was actually still alive.\n\nMarusya copycats\n\nFollowing her death, Nikiforova's surviving legacy created an opportunity for copycatsfaux Marusyasto appear in the months and years to follow. The only female atamansha while alive, Nikiforova was followed by three women fighters in the Ukrainian War of Independence who adopted her name for propaganda purposes.\n\nIn 1919, Marusya Sokolovskaia became the commander of her brother's cavalry detachment after his death in battle. A 25-year-old Ukrainian nationalist school teacher, she was captured by the Reds and shot. In 1920-1921, \"Black Maria\" (Marusya Chernaya) became a commander of a cavalry regiment in the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. She died in battle against the Red Army. A final copycat, Marusya Kosova, appeared in the Tambov Rebellion in 1921-1922. After the revolt was suppressed, she disappeared.\n\nInternational espionage rumors\n\nNikiforova was rumored to have become a spy for the Soviet government in Paris in the years following her death. There, it was claimed, she performed undercover work, and was involved in the assassination of Symon Petliura, an exiled Ukrainian nationalist and former leader of the Ukrainian People's Republic. In actuality, Petliura was assassinated by Sholom Schwartzbard. A fellow exile and Ukrainian-Jewish anarchist, and former member of Grigori Kotovsky's anarchist detachment, Schwartzbard had worked alone in the assassination. Malcolm Archibald commented, \"The only truth in this story might be the fact of anarchists doing the Bolshevik's work for them.\"\n\nNikiforova left few written records or photographs of herself during much of her life. This is owed in part to her hidden activity as an international terrorist. Operating underground, and in exile across multiple countries, Nikiforova did not begin to make her activity public knowledge until the last two years of her life, when she officially held a military command. A few contemporary records of her life survived the Soviet era. Nestor Makhno provided eye-witness accounts of several dramatic incidents in Nikiforova's life within his memoirs. Makhno's former adjutant, Viktor Belash, also wrote of her life within his own records, which were rescued from files held by the Soviet secret police. Briefly a member of the Red Army, Nikiforova's service record exists as one of the few official documentations of her life.\n\nNikiforova has been largely ignored by historians since her death. Soviet-era historians largely erased her from history, despite the important role she played in the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and subsequent civil war. A biographical dictionary of the Russian Revolution includes hundreds of entries, but does not include her. Of the few Bolshevik women who are included, none held military commands as Nikiforova did. There is no scholarly biography of her life, or historiography of her era which mentions her. The few references made to her by Bolshevik contemporaries in memoirs and works of fiction are biased against her. These depict her uniformly as \"repulsive and evil,\" with little exception.\n\nNikiforova has also been ignored by non-Soviet historians. Today, Nikiforova remains obscure and uncelebrated within Ukraine. She has been ignored by Ukrainian historians. Critics of this treatment speculate that as an anti-nationalist who fought and was executed by the White Army, Nikforova's activities have been too difficult to rewrite and reconcile to fit a reformist historical narrative.\n\nThere is little explanation for the neglect on the part of anarchist historians. While several biographies of Nestor Makhno have been published, there is little mention of Nikiforova. This is despite their close collaboration, and her greater contemporary prominence, according to biographer Malcolm Archibald: \"...in 1918 Nikiforova was already famous as an anarchist atamansha (military female leader) throughout Ukraine, while Makhno was still a rather obscure figure operating in a provincial backwater.\" Of several anarchist historians who have published histories regarding Makhno, only Alexandre Skirda's work, \"Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack\", mentions hera single paragraph, out of over 400 pages, is devoted to her.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, historians have attempted to reintroduce individuals expunged from history, such as Nikiforova, Makhno, and other anarchists. Several essays on Nikiforova have been published, and the Nikiforova biography, \"Atamansha\", published in 2007, was based on such sources in Russia and the Ukraine.\n\nNikiforova appears in the French novel \"Clarisse\", by Cecil Saint-Laurent. She keeps Clarisse prisoner in her armoured train in Ukraine, and the two women become lovers, Clarisse being deflowered by Nikiforova.\n\n\n. Historian Michael Palij refers to this city as \"Oleksandrivsk\". This should not be confused with contemporary Oleksandrivsk, as the city's Russian name formally matched Nikiforova's home city, Alexandrovsk. However, the two cities are located in entirely different regions of the Ukraine.\n\n"}

The program broadcasts each weekday morning from 4:00 a.m. to 10 a.m. Pacific Time. The program features news, traffic, weather and entertainment segments (including celebrity interviews – which are mainly done in-studio, although are occasionally performed via satellite). The program also features weekly segments on finance, tech, wellness, and food).\n\n\"Good Day L.A.\" debuted on June 18, 1993. At its inception, it was a two-hour newscast utilizing the then-traditional 'overnight headlines and traffic/weather' morning news format that was originally anchored by Antonio Mora and Susan Lichtman. Mark Thompson moved from the station's 10 p.m. newscast to serve as its weather anchor; Dagny Hultgreen served as the entertainment anchor; and Suzanne Dunn was the traffic reporter, reporting from the station's news helicopter \"Sky 11\" (now \"SkyFox\"). A weekend public affairs show with the same name aired during the 1980s.\n\nThe format was unsuccessful, and the show had suffered from frequent anchor turnover. Mora left for ABC News and was replaced by Thompson and later Tony McEwing (who has anchored the early morning \"Fox 11 Morning News\" since its 1993 launch). Hultgreen was replaced by Lonnie Lardner; Dunn was replaced by Will Kohlschreiber.\n\nThe show was retooled in March 1995 when Steve Edwards was brought in as anchor alongside Jillian Barberie (now Jillian Reynolds) as weather anchor (swapping positions with Thompson, who took over her former post reporting weather on the station's 10 p.m. newscast), and Dorothy Lucey handling the entertainment reports; Rod Bernsen took over the traffic reports from the helicopter, and McEwing reported headlines from the newsroom.\n\nIn mid-2012, the show saw its first major lineup change in nearly two decades with the departure of Lucey, whose contract was not renewed in May. Around the same time, Reynolds was offered to work on a freelance basis and began appearing less frequently on the program. Unsatisfied with the demotion, Reynolds chose to leave completely in September of that year. At the same time of Reynolds' departure, frequent guest host Maria Sansone was made a full-time co-host of the program, alongside Edwards. The two were later joined by Araksya Karapetyan who served as a third host/anchor with regular contributions from Lisa Breckenridge, Marla Tellez and Tony McEwing.\n\nBoth Lisa Breckenridge and Maria Sansone were let go from the show in January 2017 unannounced. For a short period the broadcast was hosted by just Edwards and Karapetyan before the latter was moved to the channel's early morning newscast. Liz Habib then joined as the show's new co anchor. On December 4, 2017, Megan Colarossi joined the show as the new co anchor alongside Edwards replacing Habib who returned to be a sports anchor. The teaming lasted just one week, as Edwards was let go by KTTV.\n\nIn 2001, \"Good Day L.A.\" spun off a nationally syndicated program called Good Day Live, which was an hour-long version of the local show with the same hosts; the program, which featured the same format as \"Good Day L.A.\" (although with more of an emphasis on entertainment news, interviews and feature stories over news headlines), was distributed by Twentieth Television and was originally launched on the Fox Television Stations, the parent of KTTV which operates Fox's owned-and-operated stations. Jillian Barberie was fired from the show and Dorothy Lucey left the syndicated version in 2004, yet both continued to host the L.A.-based version. They were replaced by Arthel Neville and Debbie Matenopoulos. \"Good Day Live\" was cancelled a year later due to low ratings.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of \"Good Day Live\", KTTV expanded \"Good Day L.A.\" to three hours, running until 10 a.m. local time (becoming the first Fox-owned station, and one of the earliest stations not affiliated with the Big Three networks, to expand their morning newscast into the 9 a.m. hour). Also in 2005, \"Good Day L.A.\" added a Sunday edition of the program that was hosted by Robb Weller, Nischelle Turner and Elizabeth Espinosa (in July 2006, the \"Good Day L.A.\" branding was removed from the Sunday edition and the format was changed to a more straightforward newscast; Turner and Espinosa were reassigned to other news programs, but Weller remained and co-anchored the Sunday morning newscast with Gina Silva until that program was cancelled by the end of the decade).\n\nKTTV expanded \"Good Day L.A.\" to five 1/2 hours on December 10, 2018, incorporating the morning news program that began at 4:30 a.m. into the show. The 4:30 a.m.-7:30 a.m. part of the show is anchored by Araksya Karapetyan & Tony McEwing. The 7:30 a.m.-10a.m. is hosted by Elex Michaelson, Megan Colarossi, Rita Garcia, Vanessa Borge, weather anchor Maria Quiban, entertainment reporter Julie Chang and traffic reporters Rick Dickert and Soumada Khan.\n\nOn March 4, 2019 \"Good Day L.A.\" changes its Anchor lineup. The 4:30-6:00am part is hosted by Dan Cohen & Rita Garcia. The 6:00-9:00am is hosted by Araksya Karapetyan & Tony McEwing. The 9:00-10:00am is hosted by Megan Colarossi & Vanessa Borge.\n\nKTTV expanded \"Good Day L.A.\" to six hours on April 1, 2019.\n\n\n\n\nThe station's early morning newscast, \"Fox 11 Morning News\", premiered alongside \"Good Day L.A.\" in June 1993; it was originally anchored by Diana Koricke and Tony McEwing, with veteran KTTV reporter and former anchor Tony Valdez serving as an occasional fill-in anchor. Koricke left television news in June 1996 and was replaced on the broadcast by Jean Martirez (who joined the station from KCNC-TV in Denver). The show originated as an hour-long newscast beginning at 6 a.m., but was later expanded to 90 minutes, with a 5:30 a.m. start time. In 2004, an additional half-hour was added, expanding the morning newscast to two hours beginning at 5 a.m. (long after many other stations around the country, particularly in markets as large as Los Angeles, expanded their morning newscasts into the 5 a.m. slot). The morning newscast was expanded to 4:30 a.m. in April 2010.\n\nOn July 14, 2008, KTTV debuted a half-hour late morning newscast that immediately follows \"Good Day L.A.\" at 10:00 a.m. The program is currently anchored by McEwing and Araksya Karapetyan. In December of that year, a half-hour noon broadcast debuted on the station, which was reformatted in September 2011 from a traditional midday newscast to a mix of news and features with \"Good Day\" anchors Edwards and Sansone brought in to anchor the broadcast.\n\nIn December 2018, Good Day L.A expanded from a 3-hour show starting at 7 a.m. to a 5 1/2 hour show starting 4:30 a.m.\n\nOn April 1, 2019, Good Day L.A. expanded from a 5 1/2 hour show starting at 4:30 a.m. to a 6 hour show starting 4:00 a.m.\n\nCritics of \"Good Day L.A.\" have praised the show for being \"so wonderfully bonkers\", particularly in comparison with its competition, including KTLA's morning newscast as well as the national network morning shows seen on ABC, CBS and NBC.\n\nClips from \"Good Day L.A.\" are frequently shown on the E! comedic television roundup series \"The Soup\". The show features their logo and often showcases interviews or funny moments either in studio or from the field. Clips from this show have appeared on late night talk shows like The Tonight Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live!\n\n"}

{"id": "2219506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219506", "title": "Hilda Ogden", "text": "Hilda Ogden\n\nHilda Ogden (also Crabtree) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, \"Coronation Street\", one of the best-known of all the regular characters in the serial, whose name became synonymous with a classic hard-working Northern working-class woman. She was played by Jean Alexander from 1964 to 1987, with two guest appearances in 1990 and 1998.\n\nFor much of her period as a character in the Street, Hilda worked as cleaner of The Rovers Return Inn. A gossip and busybody, many of her storylines were used for comedic purposes, though the character was equally used for dramatic effect; a scene in which she wept over the spectacles of her recently-deceased husband Stan (Bernard Youens) has been hailed as one of the most moving images in television history.\n\nAlexander quit the role of Hilda in 1987 after 23 years but was persuaded to reprise the part in 1990 for a one-off appearance as part of an ITV Telethon. She has also been seen in a spin-off video in 1998, in which another long-running character, Betty Williams (Betty Driver), visited her at her new home. Both of these appearances are considered canon to the show.\n\nArguably the serial's most popular character of all time, Hilda was voted the greatest TV character in a \"Radio Times\" poll of over 5,000 people. The typical appearance of Hilda, wearing hair curlers and a head scarf, has inspired art and catwalk themes. Despite various producers expressing their desire to see the character return, Jean Alexander was openly critical about the direction \"Coronation Street\" had taken, vowing never to reprise the role of Hilda again.\n\nAlexander had previously appeared in 1962 as Mrs. Webb, the landlady of Joan Akers (Anna Cropper), who abducted baby Christopher Hewitt (Victoria Baker).\n\nHilda Ogden, with her trademark hair curlers and pinny, has been described as \"the classic hard-working class Northern woman. With a voice like breaking glass and a temper to match\". Actress Jean Alexander explained her interpretation of Hilda's head scarf and curler look: \"Like Hilda, my roots were in Liverpool and that’s where I first noticed the curlers and headscarf look. The curlers were put under the headscarf by the factory girls. They had their hair tied up and scarves like that to stop their fashionable long hair getting caught up in the machinery at work. They had the curlers in place in case they got asked out on a date, so they’d be ready for a night out after the shift.\" Alexander stated in 2010 that she based Hilda on bits of differing, eccentric people she had seen in her youth in Liverpool.\nA term that has been described as synonymous with Hilda Ogden is \"busybody\". Critic for \"The Guardian\", Grace Dent, has suggested that Hilda \"spent the 70s providing an unofficial town-crier service for Coronation Street scandal. Hilda was known to sleep propped up in bed with one eye open so she could see what time Ken Barlow (William Roache)'s female friends left, (or what time they were carried out in bodybags. Ken's never had much luck with women.)\". She added that Hilda was the mould that other popular soap gossips were made from, including Dot Cotton (June Brown) from \"EastEnders\", Lynda Snell from \"The Archers\" and Martha Huber from \"Desperate Housewives\".\n\nThe Ogdens, Hilda and her husband Stan (Bernard Youens), have been hailed as one of \"Coronation Street's\" favourite couples. The bickering pair stayed together through mishap and financial difficulty. A working-class couple, they remained a screen double act for 20 years until actor Bernard Youens died on 27 August 1984, forcing the writers of the soap to kill off Stan on-screen. A scene following Stan's screen funeral, showing Hilda weeping at the sight of Stan's signature spectacles, has been described as \"one of the most moving moments in TV history\" and \"instrumental in winning [Jean Alexander] the Royal Television Society's Best Performance Award for 1984-5\". Neil Marland, who worked as Granada Television's stills photographer for 30 years, has described the scene as terribly poignant, adding, \"Everyone was crying and the camera tracked in – she had to undo his handkerchief, and in it were his glasses. She broke down sobbing. And, of course, I had to do a picture of this. So I left her for a minute or so sobbing. Then, as I got nearer, I just went, 'Jean, Jean...' And she sat bolt upright and said, 'What picture do you want Neil? I'm only acting'. It was just amazing because everyone on the floor was in floods of tears.\"\n\nCommenting on the screen partnership, actress Jean Alexander has said, \"It was a real pleasure working with Bernard Youens, who played my screen husband, Stan. Any success I have had is really down to Bernard because we worked well as a team and each knew how the other would want to play a scene. It was a happy screen partnership but it was strictly professional. We didn't socialise after work.\" Alexander has stated that the Ogdens were a brilliant set-up: \"They were the only couple in the street who were married – permanently. They were the only ones who owned their own house where everyone else rented, they stayed together and didn't stray or have affairs and, yes, they bickered among themselves but let anyone else criticise either of them and they would be up in arms.\"\n\nHilda and Stan Ogden were voted Britain's top romantic TV couple in 2002, in a poll of more than 5,000 people carried out by NTL:Home. They beat off competition from \"Friends\"' couple Monica Geller and Chandler Bing (Courteney Cox and Matthew Perry) and Dot and Jim Branning from \"EastEnders\" (June Brown and John Bardon). In 2005 the couple topped another poll. The Ogdens were voted ITV's favourite TV characters in a survey by \"Broadcast\" magazine, which took place to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the network. They beat \"Minder's\" Arthur Daley and \"Prime Suspect's\" DCI Jane Tennison, who took second and third place respectively.\n\nAfter 23 years playing Hilda, Jean Alexander decided to leave \"Coronation Street\" in 1987. According to Alexander in 2010, it was the right time to leave as the writers had run out of ideas for Hilda and as a character, Hilda had run out of steam. She added, \"Her other half had gone and she would have just scraped along. I didn't want that.\" Alexander went to see the show's producer Bill Podmore to inform him she did not want to renew her contract.\n\nHer decision to leave prompted an outcry from fans and a \"Save Hilda\" campaign was launched, as many did not realise that the actress had made her own decision to depart. Hilda's final scenes in the programme were aired on Christmas Day 1987, when the locals in the Rovers Return joined Hilda in what has been described as a \"stirring rendition\" of \"Wish Me Luck as You Wave Me Goodbye\".\n\nOn-screen, Hilda departed for Hartington, Derbyshire, to make a new life for herself as the housekeeper for Doctor Lowther. 27 million viewers watched. It remains the highest-rated episode in \"Coronation Street's\" history. It has been described as the most moving scene in \"Coronation Street\" that did not involve a death. The writer behind the \"memorable\" episode depicting Hilda Ogden's departure, which attracted a record soap opera audience, was Leslie Duxbury.\n\nSince her departure in 1987, various producers have expressed their desire to see Hilda Ogden back on \"Coronation Street\". In 1990, Jean Alexander reprised the role after two-and-a-half years as part of ITV's 27-hour charity telethon. The episode showed her visiting Stan's grave. In 1998, the character was resurrected again, as part of a special direct to video film.\n\nHowever, in 2005 actress Jean Alexander ruled out ever returning to the role of Hilda Ogden, due to \"Coronation Street's\" overemphasis on sex and \"who's sleeping with whom\". She also criticised the soap for not being fun enough and she disapproved of the modern storylines, saying some are allowed to \"drag on forever\". She added:\n\nA spokesperson for the soap responded to Alexander's criticism, saying, \"We don't subscribe to Jean's opinions. Every week 12 million people across the country tune in to be entertained by the drama in \"Coronation Street\".\" Alexander reportedly declined to return as Hilda as part of \"Coronation Street's\" 50th anniversary celebrations in December 2010. They allegedly offered her a large sum of money but her agent Joan Reddin stated: \"She's not interested in getting involved again.\" When interviewed in 2010, Alexander further discussed her reasons for not wanting to return to the role of Hilda. She said, \"It would be impossible for me to recreate Hilda. She would be totally different from the scrubber who left the Street [...] I'm sorry, after 23 years I couldn't recreate that character as she would be now – and I didn't want to play her as she was. Hilda would be about 91 now. She left to be housekeeper for the lovely doctor and be part of a village community. She has status now which is something she always wanted. I have changed so I'm sure she has. And I think the fans would be disappointed. It would have spoiled the memories people had of her.\"\n\nHilda and her husband Stan (Bernard Youens) were first featured in \"Coronation Street\" in June 1964. A working class couple, beset with financial woes and few friends, many of the more established characters looked down on the Ogdens. Hilda worked as a char, cleaning the Rovers Return, Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs)'s factory and private homes, while Stan cleaned windows.\n\nHilda and Stan had four children. Two children, Sylvia and Tony, were not seen on the series with the explanation that they were taken into care when Stan beat them while drunk. Their other children were seen on the programme and were named Irma (Sandra Gough) and Trevor (Jonathan Collins/Don Hawkins). Trevor stole money and ran away within the first six months of arriving on the Street, writing back home to ask Hilda to disown him. Hilda's daughter Irma worked at the Corner Shop and eventually married David Barlow (Alan Rothwell). Irma was crushed when David and her child were killed in Australia in 1970. Irma returned home for a few years, but then vanished, with the explanation being she had moved to Wales, and later Canada. Irma was not mentioned at all when Stan died and in later years, Hilda only ever stated she had two children when asked. She had little contact with her family. Trevor eventually married and gave Hilda and Stan a grandson and granddaughter, but was ashamed of the life his parents led and only made the occasional visit.\n\nLodging with the Ogdens from 1980 to 1983 was Eddie Yeats (Geoffrey Hughes), their surrogate son, and, after Stan died in November 1984 – just a year after celebrating their ruby wedding – Hilda got extra money by allowing Kevin (Michael Le Vell) and Sally Webster (Sally Whittaker) to live in one of her vacant rooms. Shortly afterwards Hilda's employers, the affluent Doctor Lowther (David Scase) and his wife (June Broughton), made the decision to sell their home and move to Hartington. However, on the night that Hilda helped Mrs Lowther pack away her treasured possessions, burglars broke into the house and violently assaulted them both. Doctor Lowther, who had gone out to get a takeaway meal, was horrified to discover his wife suffering what would be a fatal heart attack and Hilda seriously injured.\n\nAlthough she made a full recovery physically, mentally she became afraid to be in her own home. When Doctor Lowther asked her to move to his cottage in Hartington and be his housekeeper, she jumped at the chance. When Hilda left the programme on Christmas Day 1987, she sang \"Wish Me Luck As You Wave Me Goodbye\", in her trademark trilling voice; it was watched by an aggregated audience of 26.65 million people, one of the highest audiences in British television history.\n\nHilda's most remembered attributes were her hair curlers which she almost always wore, her pinny, and her \"muriel\" in her living room, which first showed a scene of Alpine mountains but was later changed to a coastal scene with three duck ornaments flying over them (the middle duck, in a nose-dive position, was Jean Alexander's idea). She considered herself clairvoyant and offered teacup readings.\n\nThe character of Hilda Ogden was very popular with the British public — in 1982 she came fourth behind the Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Diana, Princess of Wales in a poll of the most recognisable women in Britain. Hilda Ogden has been branded as the \"greatest-ever soap character\" and \"loved by millions the world over\". In 2004 she was voted the greatest soap character in a \"Radio Times\" survey of 5,000 viewers, despite the character not physically appearing on screen for 17 years at the time. Actress Jean Alexander commented on the accolade: \"I'm very flattered. It came totally out of the blue. I knew nothing about it. Friends rang to tell me and I was completely taken aback. I am surprised that so many people remembered Hilda, considering it was so long ago that I played her.\" She added in 2005 that she was amazed by the nation's enduring affection for Hilda. She said: \"I've no idea why. I'm totally flummoxed. If they remember Hilda with such affection, then I'm happy and very flattered.. ..It means that I did a good job and that's what I set out to do. I had 23 wonderful years playing Hilda. I worked with some of the Street's legends – Pat Phoenix (Elsie Tanner), Violet Carson (Ena Sharples), one of TV's greatest characters, Jack Howarth (Albert Tatlock), Arthur Leslie and Doris Speed (Jack and Annie Walker), all now sadly gone.\"\n\nVarious celebrities are known to be among her fans, including Michael Parkinson, Laurence Olivier, writer Willis Hall, the former Poet Laureate John Betjeman and Russell Harty, who formed themselves into the British League for Hilda Ogden.\n\nIn 1984, a storyline involving Hilda and her husband Stan resulted in monetary claims to the council of an increase of 200%. Off-screen, actor Bernard Youens had become ill, so the writers at \"Coronation Street\" excused his screen absence by making Stan have an injury – he hurt his toe on a pavement and was bed-ridden. In the storyline, Hilda discovered that if a paving stone is sticking up over a certain measurement, a claim can be made against the council. Hilda sued Weatherfield council and won a payout. Councils all across the UK were reportedly \"up in arms against \"Coronation Street\"\", because subsequently, claims against them for people tripping up over paving stones that were three-quarters of an inch high, increased by 200 per cent.\n\nIn 1998 a straight-to-video \"Coronation Street\" spin-off film was released. It was entitled \"The Women Of Coronation Street\" and featured clips of the show's most famous females. The video saw the brief return of Hilda Ogden, who had not been seen in the soap since 1987; Betty Williams travelled to meet her at her new home. A spokesperson for Granada Television commented, \"It shows what happens when Betty goes up to visit Hilda Ogden at her home in Derbyshire. She used to do cleaning work for a doctor and when he died he left her the house in gratitude. It'll be a souvenir fans want to keep.\"\n\nAn image of Hilda Ogden in her signature hair rollers and head scarf has been used in artist David Knopov's series of silk prints. The artist said Lenny Henry, Bill Nighy and Elvis Costello are among the famous names who have bought 'a Hilda'.\n\nHilda Ogden was cited as one of the characters to influence New York's elite fashion scene in 2004. The straightlaced tweed and hair rollers \"granny chic\" style of Sixties Britain, much of the look was derived from early episodes of \"Coronation Street\". Fashion stylist Katie Grand said: \"There's something very interesting about working class Britain in the early Sixties. \"Coronation Street\" was black-and-white and so grimy. They just looked so cool. Hilda Ogden has her hair in curlers but is also in a fabulous tweed jacket and a really nice blouse.\"\n\nThe video for one of the rock band Queen's music videos, \"I Want to Break Free\", was based on characters from \"Coronation Street\". Lead singer Freddie Mercury was said not to be a fan of any soap opera; however, when he was at home he would watch \"Coronation Street\". So, in the song's video, the members of the band dressed in drag as some of the soap's most famous female characters. Mercury's style was based loosely on the character Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), while Brian May's style was modeled loosely on Hilda Ogden. The song peaked at number 3 in the UK singles chart, and remained in the chart for fifteen consecutive weeks from its release in April 1984.\n\nIn the 1980s, Boy George criticised the most controversial video of \"Relax\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood by saying it represented a \"Hilda Ogden view of homosexuality.\"\n\nIn 2017, a longstanding character in BBC Radio 4's \"The Archers\", Peggy Woolley inherits a cat named 'Hilda Ogden', after her hairdresser Fabrice breaks up with his partner and moves to a no-pets apartment. Since her arrival in Ambridge though she proved fierce, and drew blood more than once.\n"}

This is not the masthead \"crow's nest\" of the popular imagination – above the mainmast (for example) is the main-topmast, main-topgallant-mast and main-royal-mast, so that the top is actually about 1/4 to 1/3 of the way up the mast as a whole.\n\nThe main purpose of the top is to anchor the shrouds of the topmast that extends above it. Shrouds down to the side of the hull would be at too acute an angle from the mast, so struts running out from the mast are added to take the place of the hull for a smaller copy (the topmast) of the lower mast and its rigging. Placing a few timbers between these struts produces a useful platform, the top. The futtock shrouds carry the load of the upper shrouds into the mast below.\n\nAt the upper end of the topmast and topgallant, there is a similar situation regarding the next mast up (topgallant and royal respectively). At these points a smaller top might be constructed, but it is more usual simply to leave the shroud-bearing struts open, in which case they are known as crosstrees.\n\nAccess for sailors to the top may be by a Jacob's ladder, lubber's hole, or the futtock shrouds.\n\nA foremast might be stepped into a similar fore-top platform on the foremast. A mizen-top would be a platform on the mizenmast. Similar main-top and fore-top platforms have been retained on steam ships and motor vessels as preferred locations for installing rotating radar antennae.\n\nA fighting top was an enlarged top with swivel guns, designed to fire down at the deck of enemy ships. They could also be manned by sailors or marines armed with muskets or rifles; Horatio Nelson was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar by a sniper firing from a fighting top of the \"Redoutable\".\n"}

During a tryst, Z (another man, posing as W's husband or brother) 'discovers' them in the act. Z then demands money from X to keep the affair secret from his wife, Y. Unknown to man X, both W and Z have been conspiring together against him.\n\nThe woman may also claim that the sexual encounter was non-consensual and threaten the victim with a rape or sexual harassment charge.\n\nVariants of the trick involve luring the mark with the promise of a homosexual act, underage children, child pornography, a bizarre sexual fetish, or some other activity carrying a legal penalty and/or social stigma. In the most typical form of the trick, an attractive woman approaches a man, preferably a lonely married man of considerable financial means from out of town, and entices him to a private place with the intent of maneuvering him into a compromising position, usually sexual. Afterward an accomplice blackmails the victim with photographs or similar evidence.\n\nAnother form involves accusations of professional misconduct. In an example of this form of the trick, a \"sick\" woman visits a physician, describing symptoms that require her to disrobe for the examination, require the doctor to examine the genitals, or ensure similar scrutiny from the doctor. During the examination an \"outraged husband\" or \"outraged father\" enters the room and accuses the doctor of misconduct. The \"sick\" woman, who is of course part of the deception, takes the side of her accomplice and threatens the doctor with criminal charges or a lawsuit. This form of the badger game was first widely publicized in an article in the August 25, 1930 edition of the \"Time\" magazine.\n\nNon-sexual versions of this trick also exist, particularly among ethnic and religious groups with strong social taboos, for example inducing a Mormon to gamble or drink alcohol in violation of his religious vows, and then demanding money to keep the indulgence secret and thus preserve his reputation.\n\nOne explanation is that the term originated in the practice of badger baiting.\n\nSometimes the accomplice will simply burst into the room during the act, claiming to be the woman's husband, father, brother, etc., and \"demand justice\". The trick was particularly effective in the 19th and earlier 20th century when the social repercussions of adultery were much greater. A famous person known to have been victimized by the scheme was the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, whose adulterous affair with Maria Reynolds was used by her husband to extort money and information from him.\n\nThe badger game has been featured as a plot device in numerous books, movies and television shows.\n\n"}
{"id": "2219530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219530", "title": "Irving Mills", "text": "Irving Mills\n\nIrving Harold Mills (born Isadore Minsky; 16 January 1894 – 21 April 1985) was an American music publisher, musician, lyricist, and jazz artist promoter. He sometimes used the pseudonyms Goody Goodwin and Joe Primrose.\n\nMills was born to a Jewish family in Odessa, Ukraine, although some biographies state that he was born in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. His father, Hyman Minsky (1868–1905), was a hat maker who had immigrated from Odessa to the United States with his wife Sofia \"(née\" Sophia Schifre; born 1869). His father, Hyman, died in 1905, forcing Irving and his brother, Jacob \"(aka\" \"Jack\"; 1891–1979), to work odd jobs including bussing at restaurants, selling wallpaper, and working in the garment industry. By 1910, Mills was listed as a telephone operator.\n\nMills married Beatrice (\"Bessie\") Wilensky (1876–1976) in 1911 and they subsequently moved to Philadelphia. By 1918 Mills was working for publisher Leo Feist. His brother, Jack, was working as a manager for McCarthy and Fisher, the music publishing firm of lyricist Joseph McCarthy (1883–1943) and songwriter Fred Fisher (1875–1942).\n\nHe died in Palm Springs, California in 1985 at age 91.\n\nIn July 1919, Irving Mills and his brother, Jack, founded Jack Mills, Inc., which was renamed Mills Music Inc. in 1928. Mills Music acquired the bankrupt Waterson, Berlin & Snyder, Inc. in 1929. Irving Mills and Jack Mills (1892–1979) (Irving's brother and business partner) sold Mills Music February 25, 1965, to Utilities and Industries Corporation (a utility company based in New York). In 1969, Utilities and Industries Corporation merged Mills Music with Belwin, another music publisher, to form Belwin-Mills. Educational publisher Esquire Inc. (who had recently sold the magazine) announced its acquisition of Belwin-Mills in 1979. Gulf & Western acquired Esquire Inc. in 1983 and sold the Belwin-Mills print business to Columbia Pictures Publications in 1985.\n\nUtilities and Industries Corporation restructured Mills Music as The Mills Music Trust. At the time of the sale, the top 10 earning compositions were:\n\n\nFor the year ending 1963, 114 titles brought in 77 percent of the royalty income for five years. The total number of compositions, at the time of sale, were estimated to be in excess of 25,000, of which, 1,500 were still producing royalties. In 1964, Mills had royalties of 1,331,000 dollars. The company encompassed 20 music publishing subsidiaries (some of which were acquired for $300), as well as publishing concerns in Britain, Brazil, Canada, France, then West Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Spain.\n\nThe Mills Music Trust traded in units OTC (over-the-counter) under the symbol MMTRS. The trust received payments from EMI Records based on a complex formula that changed in 2010, when the trust passed almost all of the funds to unit holders.\n\nBoth Jack and Irving discovered a number of great songwriters, including Zez Confrey, Sammy Fain, Harry Barris, Gene Austin, Hoagy Carmichael, Jimmy McHugh, and Dorothy Fields. He greatly advanced and even started a few of the careers of Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Ben Pollack, Jack Teagarden, Benny Goodman, Will Hudson, Raymond Scott and many others.\n\nAlthough he only sang a little, Irving decided to put together his own studio recording group. He started the group Irving Mills and his Hotsy Totsy Gang with Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, Arnold Brillhardt (1904–1998) (clarinet, soprano and alto sax), Arthur Schutt, and Mannie Klein. Other variations of his bands featured Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, and Red Nichols (Mills gave Red Nichols the tag \"and his Five Pennies.\")\n\nOne evening, around 1925, Mills went to a small club on West 49th Street between 7th Avenue and Broadway called the Club Kentucky, often referred to as the Kentucky Club, formerly the Hollywood Club. The owner had brought in a small band of six musicians from Washington, D.C., and wanted to know what Mills thought of them. Instead of going out and making the rounds, Mills stayed the rest of the evening listening to the band, Duke Ellington and his Kentucky Club Orchestra. According to lore, Mills signed Ellington the very next day. They made numerous records together, not only under the name of Duke Ellington, but using groups that incorporated Duke's sidemen, who were great instrumentalists in their own right.\n\nMills managed Ellington from 1926 to 1939. His contract with Ellington, by standards of any era from then and now, was a very favorable one. Mills owned 50% of Duke Ellington Inc. and thus got his name tag on quite a number of tunes that became popular standards: \"Mood Indigo\", \"(In My) Solitude\", \"It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" \"Sophisticated Lady\", and many others now listed on the ASCAP website. He also pushed Ellington to record for Victor, Brunswick, Columbia, the \"dime store labels\" (Banner, Romeo, Perfect, Melotone, Cameo, Lincoln, and others) and even Hit of the Week. In spite of having a limited vocabulary, Mills was a deft lyricist. He sometimes used a ghost writer to complete his idea and sometimes built on the idea of the ghost writer. He was instrumental in getting Duke Ellington hired by the Cotton Club.\n\nMills was one of the first to record black and white musicians together, using twelve white musicians and the Duke Ellington Orchestra on a 12-inch 78 rpm record featuring \"St. Louis Blues\" on one side and a medley of songs called \"Gems from Blackbirds of 1928\" on the other side, Mills himself singing with the Ellington Orchestra. Victor Records – soon to become RCA Victor – initially hesitated to release the record, but when Mills threatened to take his artists off the roster, he won out.\n\nMills thought he should ensure that the Ellington Orchestra always had top musicians and protected himself by forming the Mills Blue Rhythm Band, using them as a relief band at the Cotton Club. Cab Calloway and his band went into the Cotton Club with a new song Irving co-wrote with Calloway and Clarence Gaskill called \"Minnie the Moocher\".\n\nOne of his most significant innovations was the \"band within a band\" concept, recording small groups to record hot small group sides for the various dime store labels. He started this in 1928 by arranging for members of Ben Pollack's band to make records under a bewildering array of pseudonyms on dime store labels — like Banner, Oriole, Cameo, Domino, and Perfect — while Pollack had an exclusive contract with Victor. Quite a number of these dime store small group records are considered major jazz classics by collectors. He printed \"small orchestrations\" transcribed off the record, so that non-professional musicians could see how great solos were constructed. This was later done by Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, and several other bands.\n\nIrving also formed Mills Artists Booking Company. It was in 1934 that he formed an all-female orchestra, headed by Ina Ray. He added the name Hutton and it became the popular Ina Ray Hutton and her Orchestra.\n\nIn 1934 as well, Mills Music began a publishing subsidiary, Exclusive Publications, Inc., specializing in orchestrations by the likes of Will Hudson (1908–1981) who co-wrote the song \"Mr. Ghost Goes to Town\" with Mills and Mitchell Parish in 1936.\n\nIn late 1936, with involvement by Herbert Yates of the American Record Corporation, Mills started the Master and Variety labels, which for their short life span were distributed by ARC through their Brunswick and Vocalion label sales staff. (Mills had previously A&R'ed for Columbia in 1934–36, after ARC purchased the failing label.) Irving signed Helen Oakley Dance to supervise the small group records for the Variety label (35 cents or 3 for $1.00). The Master label sold for 75 cents. From December 1936, through about September 1937, a large number of records were issued on these labels (40 were issued on Master and 170 on Variety). Master's best selling artists were Duke Ellington, Raymond Scott, as well as Hudson-De Lange Orchestra, Casper Reardon and Adrian Rollini. Variety's roster included Cab Calloway, Red Nichols, the small groups from Ellington's band led by Barney Bigard, Cootie Williams, Rex Stewart, and Johnny Hodges, as well as Noble Sissle, Frankie Newton, The Three Peppers, Chu Berry, Billy Kyle, and other major and minor jazz and pop performers around New York.\n\nBy late 1937 a number of problems caused the collapse of these labels. The Brunswick and Vocalion sales staff had problems of their own, with competition from Victor and Decca, and it wasn't easy to get this new venture off the ground. Mills tried to arrange for distribution overseas to get his music issued in Europe, but was unsuccessful. After the collapse of the labels, those titles that were still selling on Master were reissued on Brunswick and those still selling on Variety were reissued on Vocalion. Mills continued his M-100 recording series after the labels were taken over by ARC, and after cutting back recording to just the better selling artists, new recordings made from about January 1938 by Master were issued on Brunswick (and later Columbia) and Vocalion (later the revived Okeh) until May 7, 1940. Starting March 8, 1939, an Ellington session, the prefix \"W\" was added to matrices \"(e.g.,\" WM-990 and WM-991). This matrix series was then used until WM-1150, the final being a session by the Adrian Rollini Trio performing \"The Girl With the Light Blue Hair,\" Voc/Okeh 5979, May 7, 1940, New York City. There were 1,055 session in the series.\n\nMills was recording all the time and became the head of the American Recording Company, which is now Columbia Records. Once radio blossomed Mills was singing at six radio stations seven days a week plugging Mills tunes. Jimmy McHugh, Sammy Fain, and Gene Austin took turns being his pianist.\n\nHe produced one picture, \"Stormy Weather\", for 20th Century Fox in 1943, which starred Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, Zutty Singleton, and Fats Waller and the dancers the Nicholas Brothers and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson. He had a contract to do other movies but found it \"too slow;\" so he continued finding, recording, and plugging music.\n\nAmong the artists Mills personally recorded were:\n\nNotes\nGeneral references\n\nInline citations\n"}
{"id": "2219538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219538", "title": "Calcium signaling", "text": "Calcium signaling\n\nCalcium signaling is the use of calcium ions (Ca) to communicate and drive intracellular processes often as a step in signal transduction. Ca is important for cellular signalling, for once it enters the cytosol of the cytoplasm it exerts allosteric regulatory effects on many enzymes and proteins. Ca can act in signal transduction resulting from activation of ion channels or as a second messenger caused by indirect signal transduction pathways such as G protein-coupled receptors.\n\nThe resting concentration of Ca in the cytoplasm is normally maintained around 100 nM. This is 20,000- to 100,000-fold lower than typical extracellular concentration. To maintain this low concentration, Ca is actively pumped from the cytosol to the extracellular space, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and sometimes into the mitochondria. Certain proteins of the cytoplasm and organelles act as buffers by binding Ca. Signaling occurs when the cell is stimulated to release Ca ions from intracellular stores, and/or when Ca enters the cell through plasma membrane ion channels.\n\nSpecific signals can trigger a sudden increase in the cytoplasmic Ca levels to 500–1,000 nM by opening channels in the ER or the plasma membrane. The most common signaling pathway that increases cytoplasmic calcium concentration is the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway.\n\n\nDepletion of Ca from the ER will lead to Ca entry from outside the cell by activation of \"Store-Operated Channels\" (SOCs). This inflow of Ca is referred to as Ca-release-activated Ca current (ICRAC). The mechanisms through which ICRAC occurs are currently still under investigation. Although Orai1 and STIM1, have been linked by several studies, for a proposed model of store-operated calcium influx. Recent studies have cited the phospholipase A2 beta, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), and the protein STIM 1 as possible mediators of ICRAC.\n\nCalcium is a ubiquitous second messenger with wide-ranging physiological roles. These include muscle contraction, neuronal transmission (as in an excitatory synapse), cellular motility (including the movement of flagella and cilia), fertilization, cell growth (proliferation), neurogenesis, learning and memory as with synaptic plasticity, and secretion of saliva. High levels of cytoplasmic Ca can also cause the cell to undergo apoptosis. Other biochemical roles of calcium include regulating enzyme activity, permeability of ion channels, activity of ion pumps, and components of the cytoskeleton.\n\nMany of Ca mediated events occur when the released Ca binds to and activates the regulatory protein calmodulin. Calmodulin may activate the Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, or may act directly on other effector proteins. Besides calmodulin, there are many other Ca-binding proteins that mediate the biological effects of Ca.\n\nContractions of skeletal muscle fiber are caused due to electrical stimulation. This process is caused by the depolarization of the transverse tubular junctions. Once depolarized the sarcoplasmic reticulm (SR) releases Ca into the myoplasm where it will bind to a number of calcium sensitive buffers. The Ca in the myoplasm will diffuse to Ca regulator sites on the thin filaments. This leads to the actual contraction of the muscle.\n\nContractions of smooth muscle fiber are dependent on how a Ca influx occurs. When a Ca influx occurs, cross bridges form between myosin and actin leading to the contraction of the muscle fibers. Influxes may occur from extracellular Ca diffusion via ion channels. This can lead to three different results. The first is a uniform increase in the Ca concentration throughout the cell. This is responsible for increases in vascular diameters. The second is a rapid time dependent change in the membrane potential which leads to a very quick and uniform increase of Ca. This can cause a spontaneous release of neurotransmitters via sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve channels. The last potential result is a specific and localized subplasmalemmal Ca release. This type of release increases the activation of protein kinase, and is seen in cardiac muscle where it causes excitation-concentration coupling. Ca may also result from internal stores found in the SR. This release may be caused by Ryaodine (RYRs) or IP receptors. RYRs Ca release is spontaneous and localized. This has been observed in a number of smooth muscle tissues including arteries, portal vein, urinary bladder, ureter tissues, airway tissues, and gastrointestinal tissues. IP Ca release is caused by activation of the IP receptor on the SR. These influxes are often spontaneous and localized as seen in the colon and portal vein, but may lead to a global Ca wave as observed in many vascular tissues.\n\nIn neurons, concomitant increases in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca are important for the synchronization of neuronal electrical activity with mitochondrial energy metabolism. Mitochondrial matrix Ca levels can reach the tens of μM levels that are necessary for the activation of isocitrate dehydrogenase, which is one of the key regulatory enzymes of the Krebs cycle.\n\nThe ER, in neurons, may serve in a network integrating numerous extracellular and intracellular signals in a binary membrane system with the plasma membrane. Such an association with the plasma membrane creates the relatively new perception of the ER and theme of “a neuron within a neuron.” The ER's structural characteristics, ability to act as a Ca sink, and specific Ca releasing proteins, serve to create a system that may produce regenerative waves of Ca release. These may communicate both locally and globally in the cell. These Ca signals integrate extracellular and intracellular fluxes, and have been implicated to play roles in synaptic plasticity, memory, neurotransmitter release, neuronal excitability, and long term changes at the gene transcription level. ER stress is also related to Ca signaling and along with the unfolded protein response, can cause ER associated degradation (ERAD) and autophagy.\n\nCa influx during fertilization has been observed in many species as a trigger for development of the oocyte. These influxes may occur as a single increase in concentration as seen with fish and echinoderms, or may occur with the concentrations oscillating as observed in mammals. The triggers to these Ca influxes may differ. The influx have been observed to occurs via membrane Ca conduits and Ca stores in the sperm. It has also been seen that sperm binds to membrane receptors that lead to a release in Ca from the ER. The sperm has also been observed to release a soluble factor that is specific to that species. This ensures cross species fertilization does not occur. These soluble factors lead to activation of IP which causes a Ca release from the ER via IP receptors. It has also been seen that some model systems mix these methods such as seen with mammals. Once the Ca is released from the ER the egg starts the process of forming a fused pronucleus and the restart of the mitotic cell cycle. Ca release is also responsible for the activation of NAD kinase which leads to membrane biosynthesis, and the exocytosis of the oocytes cortical granules which leads to the formation of the hyaline layer allowing for the slow block to polyspermy.\n\n"}

Ruqayyah became a Muslim when her mother died. When Muhammad began to preach openly in 613, the Quraysh reminded Muhammad that they had \"relieved him of his care for his daughters\" and decided to return them so that he would have to support them at his own expense. They told Utbah that they would give him \"the daughter of Aban ibn Sa'id ibn Al-As or the daughter of Sa'id ibn Al-As\" if he divorced Ruqayyah. After Muhammad warned Abū Lahab that he would go to Hell, Abu Lahab said he would never speak to his son again unless he divorced Ruqayyah, which Utbah accordingly did.\n\nBy 615 Ruqayyah was married to a prominent Muslim, Uthman ibn Affan. She accompanied him on the first Migration to Abyssinia, where she suffered a miscarriage. They returned to Abyssinia in 616, and there Ruqayyah gave birth to a son, Abdullah, in 619. Abdullah died when he was six years old in Medina. She had no further children.\n\nUthman and Ruqayyah were among those who returned to Mecca in 619. Uthman emigrated to Medina in 622, and Ruqayyah followed him later.\n\nRuqayyah was said to be extremely beautiful. When Usama ibn Zayd was sent on an errand to their house, he found himself staring at her and at Uthman in turns. Muhammad asked Usama, \"Have you ever seen a more handsome couple than those two?\" and he agreed that he had not.\n\nRuqayyah fell ill in March 624. Uthman was excused from his military duties in order to nurse her. She died later in the month, on the day when Zayd ibn Harithah returned to Medina with news of their victory at the Battle of Badr. When Muhammad returned to Medina after the battle, the family went to grieve at her grave. The women wept noisily, and Umar hit them with his whip; but Muhammad said: \"Let them weep, Umar; but beware of the braying of Satan.\"\n\nSeveral prominent Shia accounts, like that of medieval Shiite cleric Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, claim that Ruqayyah was beaten to death by Uthman. Some Shia accounts don't consider her to have been a biological daughter of Muhammad; they consider Fatimah as his only biological daughter.\n\n"}

Landes (1924–2013), formerly Emeritus Professor of Economics and former Coolidge Professor of History at Harvard University. In it, Landes elucidates the reasons why some countries and regions of the world experienced near miraculous periods of explosive growth while the rest of the world stagnated. He does this by comparing the long-term economic histories of different regions of the world, giving priority to Europe and the United States, as well as Japan, China, the Arab world, and Latin America. In addition to analyzing economic and cliometric figures, he gives substantial credit to such intangible assets as culture and enterprise in the different societies he examines in order to explain economic success or failure.\n\nIn \"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\", Landes revives, at least in part, several theories he believes have been incorrectly discarded by academics over the previous forty years:\n\n\nHe also spends a good deal of effort to debunk claims that the Asian miracle did not happen, was not significant, or was financed by European colonialism, and he draws a correlation between the economic level of a country and the way it treats its women.\n\nIn short, he argues that the vast economic growth of the Industrial Revolution was no accident but instead resulted from several qualities of Europe, including its climate, political competition, economic freedom and attitude towards science and religion, more specifically from certain countries in Western Europe, primarily England.\n\nCritics have charged Landes with eurocentrism in his analysis, a charge which Landes himself does not deny; in fact, he embraces it explicitly, arguing that an explanation for an economic miracle that happened originally only in Europe (though he deals with the later 'Asian miracle' in \"Wealth and Poverty\") must of necessity be a Eurocentric analysis, thus siding at least at some level with thinkers such as Bernard Lewis. Following Daniel Bell, knowledge is the necessary link between 'The European miracle' and the American post-industrial society.\n\nLandes and Andre Gunder Frank, author of \"ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age\" (), are noted for having come to very different conclusions about the long-vie significance of economic developments in \"the West\" during the modern era and publicly debated their findings in 1998 at Northwestern University.\n\nAdditionally, an alternate theory relies on literacy and the gap between Protestants and Catholics as an explanation for the difference in economic results.\n\nThe economist Paul Krugman remarked in The Trouble with History (article published on his MIT-hosted blog) that the book, while containing an enormous amount of information, offered very few ideas. « What (does) ... Landes actually believe? And the answer, which seems to me to be damning, is that I am not sure. (...) So I am still waiting for a book that helps me understand what really happened in this utterly perplexing century... Whoever writes that book will have to be a person unafraid of offering theories as well as facts, and therefore of saying things that might turn out to be wrong. »\n\n\n"}

He was named to the 1963 and 1965 American League All-Star Teams.\n\nIn 1965, he was the first black pitcher to win 20 games in a season in the American League and the first black pitcher to win a World Series game for the American League. He pitched two complete game World Series victories in 1965, hitting a three-run home run in game 6, and was named The Sporting News American League Pitcher of the Year.\n\nGrant signed with the Cleveland Indians in 1954 as an amateur free agent and made his big league debut with the Indians in 1958. His best season in Cleveland was in 1961 when he had a won-loss record of 15-9 and a 3.86 earned run average. In June 1964, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins and had a record of 11-9 for the remainder of the season. In 1965 Grant had the best year of his career. He was 21-7 for the Twins, helping to lead the team to the 1965 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1965, Grant hosted a local Minneapolis variety television program, \"The Jim Grant Show\", where he sang and danced.\n\nHe finished 6th in voting for the 1965 American League MVP for leading the league in wins, won-loss percentage (.750), and shutouts (6). He also started 39 games and had 14 complete games, 270 ⅓ innings pitched, 252 hits allowed, 34 home runs allowed, 107 runs allowed, 99 earned runs allowed, 61 walks, 142 strikeouts, 8 wild pitches, 1,095 batters faced, 2 intentional walks issued, and a 3.30 ERA. Grant's home run in the 6th game of the 1965 World Series was only the second by an American League pitcher during a World Series game.\n\n1966 was Grant's last year as a full-time starting pitcher. He spent his next five seasons in baseball as a reliever and occasional starter for five different big league clubs. He and Zoilo Versalles were traded by the Twins to the Dodgers for John Roseboro, Ron Perranoski and Bob Miller on November 28, 1967.\n\nGrant was the starting pitcher for the Montreal Expos in their first ever game on April 8, 1969. He pitched 1.1 innings while allowing six hits and three runs, starting his season off with a 20.25 ERA, although the Expos would later win the game in an 11-10 shootout that had nine combined pitchers in the game.\n\nIn 14 years, he had a 145-119 record in 571 games, while starting in 293 of them and throwing 89 complete games and finishing 160 of them, 18 shutouts, 53 saves, with 2,442 innings pitched on a 3.63 ERA. Grant's home run during Game 6 of the 1965 World Series was the only one he hit that season and one of only seven he hit in his entire career.\n\nAs a hitter, Grant posted a .178 batting average (135-for-759) with 80 runs, 6 home runs, 65 RBI and 37 bases on balls.\nDefensively, he recorded a .966 fielding percentage.\n\nAfter his playing career ended, Grant worked for the North American Softball League, one of three Men's Professional Softball Leagues active in the pro softball era. He later worked as a broadcaster and executive for the Indians, and also as a broadcaster for the Athletics.\n\nIn recent years, Grant has dedicated himself to studying and promoting the history of blacks in baseball. On his official website, Grant pays tribute to the fifteen black pitchers (including himself) who have won 20 games in a season. The \"15 Black Aces\" are: Vida Blue, Al Downing, Bob Gibson, Dwight Gooden, Grant, Ferguson Jenkins, Sam Jones, Don Newcombe, Mike Norris, David Price, J. R. Richard, CC Sabathia, Dave Stewart, Dontrelle Willis, and Earl Wilson. In 2007, Grant released \"The Black Aces, Baseball's Only African-American Twenty-Game Winners\", featuring chapters on each of the black pitchers to have at least one twenty-win season, and also featuring Negro League players that Mudcat felt would have been twenty game winners if they were allowed to play. The book was featured at the Baseball Hall of Fame during Induction Weekend 2006. In February 2007 during an event to honor Black History Month, President George W. Bush honored Grant and fellow Aces, Ferguson Jenkins, Dontrelle Willis and Mike Norris, and the publication of the book, at the White House.\n\nOn April 14, 2008, he threw out the ceremonial opening pitch at Progressive Field to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his major league debut. Grant was also awarded the key to the city to honor the occasion.\n\nGrant was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2012. \n\nHe was awarded the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from Whittier College in 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "2219602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219602", "title": "Erfurt Union", "text": "Erfurt Union\n\nThe Erfurt Union () was a short-lived union of German states under a federation, proposed by the Kingdom of Prussia at Erfurt, for which the Erfurt Union Parliament (\"Erfurter Unionsparlament\"), lasting from March 20 to April 29, 1850, was opened at the former Augustinian monastery in Erfurt. The union never came into effect, and was seriously undermined in the Punctation of Olmütz (November 29, 1850; also called the Humiliation at Olmütz) under immense pressure from the Austrian Empire.\n\nIn the Revolutions of 1848, the Austrian-dominated German Confederation was dissolved, and the Frankfurt Assembly sought to establish new constitutions for the multitude of German states. The effort, however, ended in the Assembly's collapse, after King Frederick William IV refused the German crown. The Prussian government, under the influence of General Joseph Maria von Radowitz, who sought to unite the landed classes against the threat to Junker domination, seized the opportunity to initiate a new German federation under the leadership of the Hohenzollern monarch. At the same time, Frederick William IV acceded to his people's demands for a constitution, also agreeing to become leader of a united Germany.\n\nA year before the convention of the Erfurt Union Parliament, the May 26, 1849 Alliance of the Three Kings was concluded between Prussia, Saxony and Hanover, the latter two of which explicitly made the reservation of departure unless all other principalities with the exception of Austria joined. From this treaty sprung the Prussian policy of fusion, and thence the ambition of the Erfurt Union, which in its constitution abandoned universal and equal franchise in favour of the traditional three-class franchise. The constitution itself, however, was only to come into effect after revision and ratification by an elected \"Reichstag\", as well as approval by the participating governments. 150 former liberal deputies to the German national assembly had acceded to the draft at a meeting in Gotha on June 25, 1849, and by the end of August 1849, almost all (twenty-eight) principalities had recognised the \"Reich\" constitution and joined the union, due in varying degrees to Prussian pressure.\n\nDespite this, elections to the Erfurt parliament, held in January 1850, received very little popular support, or even recognition. Democrats universally boycotted the election, and with electoral participation below 50%, Saxony and Hanover exercised their reservation to leave the Alliance of Three Kings. No government in the end agreed to the constitution, and even though the document was readily accepted by the Gotha Party (incidentally narrowly defeated in the elections), it never took effect. The Erfurt parliament never materialised.\n\nMeanwhile, Austria, having overcome its difficulties – the fall of Metternich, the abdication of Ferdinand I, and constitutional revolts in Italy and Hungary – began a renewed active resistance against Prussia's union plan. The Saxon and Hanoverian withdrawals from their alliance with Prussia can also be attributed in part to Austrian encouragement. Vienna contemplated restoration of the German Confederation recalling the German Diet, and rallied the Prussian nobility and feudal-corporate and anti-national groups around the Prussian General Ludwig Friedrich Leopold von Gerlach to increasingly successfully oppose Union policy.\n\nIn Prussia itself, a congress of princes held in Berlin in May 1850 explicitly decided against the merits of introducing a constitution at the point in time. Following the Prussian king's (and his ministers') weakening volition for German unification, Radowitz's influence declined. Prussia's union policy was further weakened by Austrian urges for the restoration of the Federal Assembly in Frankfurt in September the same year.\n\nThe Prussia–Austria conflict worsened by autumn that year, as disagreements over the question of federal executions in Holstein (dispute with Denmark) and the Electorate of Hesse almost escalated into a military conflict. Since 1848 the Austrians had been allied with the Russian Empire; after the Berlin government refused Austrian demands at the Warsaw Conference of October 28, 1850, the souring relations degenerated further on Prussia's November 5 announcement that it was mobilising its army and preparing for war, in response to troops of the German Confederation advancing into the Electorate of Hesse. War was avoided when Prussian leaders closely associated with the nobility threw their support behind Gerlach with the , known informally as the \"Kreuzzeitungspartei\" after the Kreuzzeitung newspaper, which supported Austria in advocating a return to the Confederation.\n\nOn November 29, 1850, the Treaty of Olmütz was concluded between Austria and Prussia with Russian participation. The treaty, seen by many as a humbling capitulation on Prussia's part to the Viennese Hofburg, saw Prussia submitting to the Confederation, reversing tack to demobilise, agreeing to partake in the intervention of the German Diet in Hesse and Holstein and renouncing any resumption of her union policy, and hence abandoning the Erfurt Union.\n\n"}

Valverde's biggest wins have been the Vuelta a España in 2009, Critérium du Dauphiné in 2008 and 2009, Tour of the Basque Country in 2017, Volta a Catalunya in 2009, 2017 and 2018, Liège–Bastogne–Liège in 2006, 2008, 2015 and 2017, La Flèche Wallonne in 2006, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Clásica de San Sebastián in 2008 and 2014, the 2006 and 2008 UCI ProTours, the 2014 and 2015 UCI World Tours, and the road race in the 2018 World Championships.\n\nOverall, Valverde has 123 professional wins. Prior to his Worlds win, he already held the record for most medals won at World Championships – he twice collected the silver medal in the World Championships, in 2003 and 2005, as well as the bronze four times in 2006, 2012, 2013 and 2014. As of 2019, Valverde has placed in the Top 10 of a Grand Tour nineteen times. Valverde is rare in combining different specialities in road bicycle racing, being a strong climbing specialist, sprinter and a good time-trialist. The online database Cycling Ranking ranks him as the 4th best cyclist of all time.\n\nAfter a lengthy court battle, he was suspended for two years as part of the Operación Puerto blood doping investigation, but he returned to competition in 2012 upon completion of the ban. All his results from 2010 were stripped, including the overall win in the 2010 Tour de Romandie, and he did not compete in 2011.\n\nBorn in Las Lumbreras, Murcia, Valverde came from a cycling family, his father Juan was an amateur bicycle racer and bought him a bike when he was six years old. His brother Juan Francisco was also an amateur road racing cyclist. Valverde's first race was in Jumilla, in his region of Murcia, and he finished second. On the following week he won his second race in Yecla. He allegedly took more than fifty consecutive victories between 11 and 13 years old, earning him the nickname \"El Imbatido\" (The Unbeaten).\n\nDue to his many wins, Valverde was offered to ride for the elite amateur team Banesto based in Navarre, some distance away from his home in Murcia. Perhaps due to the exhaustion from having to travel back and forth every weekend, his performance suffered while with the team.\n\nHe moved to the development team of the professional squad and was coached by Francisco Moya, whom he credited with helping him become a better cyclist. Kelme also promised to allow him to move to the professional squad if he showed good performance. At the end of his first season with the Kelme amateur squad, they offered to move him to the professional squad.\n\nValverde turned professional in 2002 when he signed a contract with the Spanish team , with whom he stayed until the end of the 2004 season. During his time with Kelme he had a breakthrough year in the 2003 Vuelta a España, where he won two stages and finished third in the General classification. That year he also won the Vuelta a Mallorca and a stage in Tour of the Basque Country and other Spanish races like GP Primavera and GP Villafranca de Ordizia. He ended the season with a second place in the 2003 UCI Road World Championships behind Igor Astarloa after winning the sprint ahead of Peter Van Petegem and Paolo Bettini.\n\nIn the 2004 season he decided to stay with Kelme despite the team's financial woes and offers from other teams. He went on to win the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, the Vuelta a Murcia, a stage in the Tour of the Basque Country, the Vuelta a Burgos and taking fourth in the Vuelta a España. Although he won a stage in the Vuelta, he was injured in a crash that forced him to downscale his ambitions in the overall classification. He also participated in the Summer Olympics.\n\nValverde joined the UCI ProTeam in 2005. He won the last stage in Paris–Nice and finished second overall behind Bobby Julich. He also took two stages in the Tour of the Basque Country. In his first ever appearance at the Tour de France, he won the 10th stage of the Tour de France ahead of Lance Armstrong, whom he beat in the sprint into Courchevel at the end of a mountain stage in the Alps. After Stage 12, he was in 5th place on GC, 3 minutes and 16 seconds behind Armstrong. He was also leading in the young rider classification (white jersey), with a 3-minute and 9 second lead on Armstrong's teammate Yaroslav Popovych. However, Valverde was forced to withdraw from the Tour during the 13th stage because of a knee injury. Valverde recovered barely in time for the UCI Road World Championships in Madrid, Spain. The injury of Óscar Freire, who was the Spanish team captain, forced him to become the team leader, despite having had only one day of competition before the Worlds. Amazingly, he was able to be competitive and finished second to winner Tom Boonen.\n\nIn 2006, Valverde won a stage in the Tour of the Basque Country, finishing 2nd overall and capturing the points competition. He then completed a prestigious double in the Spring classics, winning La Flèche Wallonne and taking victory four days later at Liège–Bastogne–Liège. Valverde subsequently won a stage in the Tour de Romandie finishing 3rd overall. Valverde planned to challenge at the 2006 Tour de France, and stated that he hoped to win in the future. He went to the Pinarello bicycle factory in Treviso, Italy, to optimize his time-trialing performance. In fact he started among the favourites for the Tour after the withdrawal of Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso due to a doping investigation. However, on the third stage of the race, Valverde crashed, and had to abandon the Tour with a fractured right collarbone. His ambition to win a Grand Tour shifted to the Vuelta a España, later that year.\n\nValverde entered the Vuelta a España as the top favorite. Since he did not ride a full Tour de France he was in better condition than some of the other candidates for the victory: defending champion Denis Menchov and Carlos Sastre both ended in the top 10 of the Tour de France and were expected to be somewhat fatigued. Valverde won the 7th stage and dominated mountain stages, earning him the gold leader jersey after stage 9. Valverde lost the jersey however due to the aggressive climbing and attacking of Alexander Vinokourov. In the last time trial, Valverde again lost time on Vinokourov and had to settle for the 2nd place in the overall standings, his second podium finish in a Grand Tour. Following his impressive performance in the Vuelta, Valverde won yet another major title, winning the UCI ProTour with several major races still left on the calendar as his point lead had reached unassailable levels. At the UCI Road World Championships, Valverde was considered one of the favorites for the title. Although he did not win, he was able to finish 3rd and claim a bronze medal.\n\nHe started 2007 by winning the overall classification at Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana and Vuelta a Murcia. In stage 4 of the Vuelta a Murcia, Valverde accomplished his first win in an individual time trial. He also finished third in the Critérium International and fifth in the Tour of the Basque Country. In the Ardennes classics he took second place in both La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, unable to repeat the double victory of 2006 season. In the Tour de France, Valverde was seen as one of the favorites for the yellow jersey until he had a disastrous individual time trial that diminished his chances of fighting for the overall classification. He subsequently finished sixth overall, eleven minutes behind, and thus finished his first Tour de France after being unable to complete the race in 2005 and 2006. He decided not to race the Vuelta a España in order to prepare for the UCI Road World Championships.\n\nOn 29 August 2007, the UCI announced that they prevented Valverde from riding the World Championships in Stuttgart because of his possible implication in the Operación Puerto doping case to \"safeguard the atmosphere and reputation of the World Championships\". The UCI also called upon the Spanish Cycling Federation (RFEC) to open disciplinary proceedings against the rider, but RFEC refused to comply with the UCI's request, saying there was no new evidence against him. RFEC also included Valverde in its squad for the World Championships, where he ended up 2nd. The matter was taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which authorised Valverde to participate in the World Championships.\n\nIn 2008, Valverde showed strong form in the spring. After winning the Vuelta a Murcia, Valverde was focused on training. He announced his readiness with a podium finish in the Klasika Primavera and a triumph at the Paris–Camembert. These successes foreshadowed excellent results in the Ardennes classics: a podium at the Amstel Gold Race and victory in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. Valverde also won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and the Spanish National Road Race Championships in June. On 5 July, Valverde won the first stage of the Tour de France. His form faltered in the Pyrenees, and after being dropped on the Col du Tourmalet, eventually losing 5' 52\" to stage winner Leonardo Piepoli, scrapping hopes of a podium finish. He performed better in the Alps and claimed a top ten finish. On Alpe d'Huez it appeared that he was working alongside to try to eliminate Cadel Evans.\n\nHe followed the Tour with a strong victory in the Clásica de San Sebastián, leading out the sprint and holding off Alexandr Kolobnev and Davide Rebellin. Later, at the Vuelta a España, he started strong, winning the second stage and wearing the general classification leader's jersey on the third one. He was among the leaders in the first week. However, he lost around two minutes on a very wet stage to Saunces and any chance of a podium finish. However, he ended up in fourth position overall at the end with some strong performances including an impressive ride up the Angliru, where he was only bettered by Alberto Contador and then a good performance in the mountain time-trial. Before the participation at the UCI Road World Championships at Varese, he was mathematically proclaimed the UCI ProTour winner, being his second win in the four editions of the competition.\n\nValverde started 2009 in good form by taking the points and mountains classifications in the Vuelta a Castilla y León while finishing 9th overall with two stage victories. He could not repeat his successes of the last few years in the spring classics with his best result being a 7th at La Flèche Wallonne. He won the Klasika Primavera and the Volta a Catalunya to put those disappointments behind him. With the threat of not racing the Tour de France hanging over his head he entered the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré hoping to prove his worth. He performed consistently throughout the two early time-trials to stay in touch with the leaders before finishing second on Mont Ventoux to take the lead in the overall classification. Though Cadel Evans repeatedly attacked him in the final days he stayed on his wheel, with the help of compatriot Alberto Contador, to take the yellow jersey. On the back of these successes he appealed his ban by the Italian authorities with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in the hope of racing the tour.\n\nOn 20 September 2009, Valverde clinched the overall victory in the Vuelta a España. Despite having no stage victories, Valverde's consistency in the mountains allowed him to keep his race all the way to end that he captured on stage 9.\n\nAll his 2010 results were annulled because of the suspension.\n\nValverde made his return to the peloton during the Tour Down Under, the first race of the UCI World Tour season. He won the race's fifth stage – the queen stage of the event – by out-sprinting 's Simon Gerrans in a two-man sprint in Willunga, and finished second overall. He earned his first overall victory since his return, by winning February's Vuelta a Andalucía, as well as achieving a stage victory during the race. Valverde also finished third in Paris–Nice, and by winning stage 3 showed good form for the upcoming Tour de France. In the Tour de France he sat casually in the peloton until initiating a breakaway in stage 17, which he held onto after breaking away from the other 16 riders in the breakaway. almost chased him down, ending only 19 seconds adrift; it was Valverde's fourth Tour de France stage victory.\n\nValverde entered the Vuelta a España as a lieutenant to the defending champion Juan José Cobo in the . However, Valverde would soon become the leader when it became apparent that Cobo was not in top form. His started off with a victory in the first stage, a team time trial. Valverde would take the lead of the general, points and combination classifications after winning Stage 3, in which he chased down repeated attacks from Alberto Contador and outsprinted Joaquim Rodríguez at the finishing line. He would subsequently lose the lead to Rodríguez, but won the eighth stage atop the Collada de la Gallina in Andorra. Contador broke away from the small lead group and looked like he was heading for the win, but Rodríguez and Valverde passed him with less than to go, with Valverde taking the win. Valverde ultimately finished the Vuelta in second position overall after being a constant threat for the leader, which was Rodríguez until stage 17 where Contador soloed to victory and grabbed the lead, which he would not relinquish. Valverde won both the points and combination classification jerseys on the final day from Rodríguez as a result of a sixth-place finish on the very last stage in Madrid.\n\nValverde had to settle for a bronze medal in the World Championships in Valkenburg, as he was unable to reach Philippe Gilbert who attacked on the final climb of the Cauberg. He was the first of a group of 27 riders who had a five seconds deficit on the Belgian when crossing the line. He was supposed to participate in the Giro di Lombardia, but announced on the morning of the race that he was suffering from influenza and was putting an end to his 2012 season.\n\nAs in 2012, Valverde won the overall classification of the Vuelta a Andalucía in 2013, where he also won the points classification in the race. Valverde continued showing some good form after finishing with podium places in the Vuelta a Murcia, the Amstel Gold Race and in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. After having a decent spring campaign, Valverde aimed for a podium finish in the Tour de France. Valverde started the Tour in good form after finishing third in Ax3 Domaines behind Chris Froome and Richie Porte. However the next day, Porte lost over 15 minutes which moved Valverde into second overall right before the tour left the Pyrenees. On Stage 13, Valverde lost almost 10 minutes after getting a flat tyre. Despite a very hard pursuit, the high crosswinds and the pace of the peloton prevented him and his teammates from catching back. They ended up with the second group at the finish causing him to slip out of the top ten. Despite losing his second position, Valverde managed to do well in the Alps which moved him back into the top ten of the overall standings, finishing 8th overall.\n\nAt the Vuelta a España, after stage 10, Valverde sat fourth overall a minute behind race leader Chris Horner. However, on stage 11, he moved back up into 3rd after finishing 8th in the time trial. On stage 14, on a rainy descent, Valverde was dropped by the G.C. contenders entering the final climb a minute back. He managed to limit his losses on the final climb staying within a minute of his rivals, though losing close to a minute on Nibali, Horner, and Joaquim Rodríguez. On stage 16, he managed to cut back a handful of seconds on Nibali and Horner. He entered the penultimate stage 20 a minute behind the race leader. He came third of the stage which finished atop the steep Alto de l'Angliru, securing a podium finish in the general classification, one minute and 36 seconds behind race winner Horner. At the World Championships, he took the third place, but was criticized for failing to cover the late attack of Portuguese Rui Costa. Costa eventually reached and out sprinted Rodríguez, Valverde's Spanish teammate.\n\nIn the Tour de France, Valverde ended in fourth place in the general classification. On 2 August 2014 Valverde won the Clásica de San Sebastián for the second time in his career. He won the first uphill finish of the Vuelta a España by powering away from the leaders after leading the group for most of the final climb. He finished the Spanish Grand Tour on the third step of the podium behind Chris Froome and the overall winner Alberto Contador. After the Vuelta, it was announced that Valverde had signed a three-year contract with his , meaning that he would ride for them until at least 2017. At the World Road Race Championships in Ponferrada, Valverde stood on the third step on the podium for the third year in a row. He came in second at the Giro di Lombardia, passing Contador for first place in the UCI World Tour rankings.\n\nValverde grabbed three stage victories in the Volta a Catalunya. On stage 2, he got the better of a bunch sprint and helped score a 1–2 for the with his teammate José Joaquín Rojas. On stage 5, he launched a late attack as he was part of a small group containing all the leaders coming into Valls and won solo. On the last stage, he won the sprint of a group of about 40 riders and with the bonus seconds, snatched the second place of the overall classification from Domenico Pozzovivo. At the Amstel Gold Race he came in second, being bested in a small group sprint by Michał Kwiatkowski. The following Wednesday, Valverde equalled the record number of victories on La Flèche Wallonne with 3, distancing Julian Alaphilippe and Michael Albasini in the final meters of the Mur de Huy.\nHe went one better the following Sunday, winning the sprint of a small group of riders to impose himself on Liège–Bastogne–Liège. It was the third time in his career Valverde had won \"La Doyenne\". It was also the second time that he had won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and La Flèche Wallonne in the same year, becoming only the second rider to have achieved this double twice, after Ferdinand Kübler. In June, he won the Spanish National Road Race Championships. At the Tour de France, Valverde finished on the podium in 3rd place, his first podium finish at the Tour; achieving a lifelong dream of a top 3 finish. With that finish he had one career goal left, a World Championship victory.\n\nValverde's main goals for the 2016 season were the Ardennes classics, the Giro d'Italia and the Road Race at the Olympic Games in Rio. He started his season by taking the overall at the Vuelta a Andalucía in February. He out-powered the rest of the contenders, including Tejay van Garderen and Rafał Majka, on the climb up to the finish on the final stage. Valverde changed his initial plan of riding the Tour of Flanders and went to Tenerife to prepare for the Giro. He returned to competition by winning two stages and the overall at the Vuelta a Castilla y León which he chose to race instead of the Amstel Gold Race, a race still lacking from his palmáres. The following Wednesday he took his third consecutive La Flèche Wallonne victory and became the most prolific winner of the \"smaller\" Ardennes Classic with his fourth win. He showed his climbing prowess by controlling up until the last when he accelerated away from his rivals to take the victory. The Sunday following, he went out to repeat his Ardennes double from 2015 by securing another Liège–Bastogne–Liège win but he fell short and only managed to finish 16th.\nValverde was named in the start list for the Giro d'Italia, his first participation in the Italian race. Valverde rode a consistent race but struggled in the high mountains especially on the queen stage in the Dolomites where he lost more than three minutes. He fought back the very next day with a third place in the mountain time trial and managed to win his first Giro d'Italia stage the day after the rest day in Andalo, his 14th stage win over the three Grand Tours. He secured his spot on the podium by outclimbing Steven Kruijswijk on the very last mountain stage and finished third overall, becoming only the 16th cyclist to finish on the podium in each of the three Grand Tours. Later that year, by finishing sixth in the Tour de France, Valverde made it nine consecutive top 10 finishes in his last nine grand tour starts, a feat that had not happened since the days of Miguel Induráin.\n\nIn February 2017 Valverde took his first win of the season at the Vuelta a Murcia, a race that he had previously won four times. He followed this up with a win in the Vuelta a Andalucía for the fifth time in six years, defeating runner-up Alberto Contador by a single second and winning stage one in the process. The overall win was the 100th victory in Valverde's career. After not starting Paris–Nice due to illness, Valverde went on to dominate the Volta a Catalunya by winning stages three, five, and seven and beating runner-up Contador by over a minute. This was done in spite of him and his team being given a one-minute penalty for \"pushes\" in the opening team time trial. At the Tour of the Basque Country, Valverde won stage five and went into the final day's individual time trial as the race leader, albeit on the same time as 's Rigoberto Urán and Michael Woods, 's Romain Bardet, and ' Louis Meintjes, along with having just a three-second advantage over Contador. In the time trial, Valverde finished second on the day to Primož Roglič of by just nine seconds, and he beat Contador by fourteen seconds, extending his overall lead, and giving Valverde his third stage race victory of the season.\nHe punctuated his dominance in La Flèche Wallonne by winning the race for the fourth consecutive year and the fifth time overall. A few days later in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Valverde fended off a late attack from Dan Martin and managed to outsprint him at the line and take his fourth win in the event. After taking time off from racing to train at a 25-day altitude camp at Sierra Nevada, Valverde raced in the Critérium du Dauphiné, where in the stage four time trial he clocked the third best time, losing out only to world time trial champion Tony Martin () and 's Richie Porte by twelve and twenty-four seconds respectively. He managed to put time into the rest of his general classification rivals, including Contador, Bardet, and most notably, defending champion Chris Froome (). Over the subsequent mountain stages, Valverde was consistently aggressive, however it failed to pay off and by the end of the Dauphiné he was 4 minutes 8 seconds down on 's Jakob Fuglsang, in ninth place overall. Going into the Tour de France, Valverde stated that he would work for his teammate Nairo Quintana, however he was still considered an outside bet for the final podium by many pundits. On the opening individual time trial stage, Valverde crashed on a tight corner and was forced to abandon the Tour immediately; his first Grand Tour withdrawal since 2006. He suffered a fractured kneecap, ruling him out for several months. Ultimately, Valverde opted to end his 2017 season because of his knee injury with the hope of making his comeback at the start of the 2018 season.\n\nValverde returned to racing at the Challenge Mallorca in late January 2018. At the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, he took his first victory after his comeback, winning stage two and taking the overall lead in the process. The following weekend, he finished second to compatriot Luis León Sánchez in the Vuelta a Murcia. Later in February, Valverde claimed overall victory at the Abu Dhabi Tour, winning the stage to Jebel Hafeet. Valverde finished 17 seconds clear of Dutch rider Wilco Kelderman from .\n\nIn March, Valverde rode the Strade Bianche classic, held partially on gravel roads in torrential rain. He finished fourth, 1 minute and 25 seconds behind winner Tiesj Benoot of . Later that month, Valverde won the Volta a Catalunya for the third time in his career. Valverde won the second and fourth stages during the race, taking the race lead – and the mountains jersey as well – for good after his second stage victory. He finished 29 seconds clear of his nearest rival, teammate Nairo Quintana, after Quintana's Colombian compatriot Egan Bernal () crashed out of the race on the final day. His next race, the cobbled classic Dwars door Vlaanderen, resulted in an 11th place showing after being in the mix for the victory until the successful breakaway of eventual winner Yves Lampaert in the closing kilometers. After taking victory in the GP Miguel Induráin followed by a second place in the Klasika Primavera, he began his Ardennes campaign with 5th place at the Amstel Gold Race. On the following Wednesday he was beaten by Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe at La Flèche Wallonne, a race he had won the four previous years. Furthermore, he was unable to win Liège–Bastogne–Liège and finished 13th making it the first time since 2013 that he did not win an Ardennes Classic race.\n\nAfter a lengthy break he won the Route d'Occitanie stage race in June where he prepared for the Tour de France. He made several long attacks in service of his teammates Quintana and Mikel Landa but all the three leaders failed to threaten the podium. Valverde returned for the Vuelta a España where was supposed to work for Quintana. He won stage 2 in an uphill sprint and stage 8 in a reduced bunch sprint, beating then World Champion Peter Sagan in the latter. He maintained a high position in the general classification until the last weekend and still had a chance of overall victory. He struggled in the last two stages in Andorra and only managed to finish 5th, but won the points classification for a record-equalling fourth time.\n\nValverde won the gold medal at the UCI Road World Championships in Innsbruck, in his twelfth participation. He triumphed in a small group sprint at the finish line ahead of Romain Bardet, Michael Woods and Tom Dumoulin, becoming the second oldest Road World Champion in history after Joop Zoetemelk. An emotional Valverde called this his biggest ever victory and one he has chased for 15 years.\n\nValverde took his first major result of 2019 when he finished second overall to Ion Izagirre in the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana. He then finished second again, this time to Luis León Sánchez, at the Vuelta a Murcia. At the 2019 UAE Tour, Valverde took his first victory as World Champion by winning the sprint at the summit finish of stage 3. He would go on to finish the race in second place overall.\n\nDuring the spring classics, Valverde rode the Tour of Flanders, his first participation in the monument. He finished the race in eighth place. Valverde endured a difficult end to his spring campaign. At the Flèche Wallonne, he swallowed a bee during the race and eventually finished 11th. A crash in the leadup to Liège–Bastogne–Liège resulted in a bone edema. Valverde started the race, not knowing of the severity of his injury, and then abandoned during the event, the first time he had not finished. After recovering from his injuries, he returned to racing at the Route d'Occitanie, which he won. On 30 June, he won the Spanish National Road Race Championships for the third time in his career. At the Tour de France, he finished ninth overall.\n\nAt the Vuelta a España, Valverde took victory at stage 7 of the race, a summit finish at Mas de la Costa. He would eventually finish the Vuelta in second place overall, 2:16 minutes behind Primož Roglič. At the World Championship road race in Yorkshire, run in very rainy conditions, Valverde abandoned his title defence with about to go. Towards the end of the season, he finished second to Bauke Mollema at Il Lombardia.\n\nAlejandro Valverde has been linked by documentary and DNA evidence to the Operación Puerto, a blood-doping affair which erupted in May 2006 against doctor Eufemiano Fuentes and a number of accomplices. It uncovered doping products, bags of blood and human plasma, and code names that appeared to link top athletes, including up to 60 cyclists, to a highly organized system of doping, which relied heavily on blood transfusions.\n\nValverde was not initially linked in the investigation, but documents from Madrid's Court 31 linked Valverde to a single bag of human plasma of the 211 total bags of blood and plasma seized in the investigation. The bag of human plasma was labelled with the codes \"Valv\", \"Piti\" and \"18\". In 2007 Valverde was banned by the International Cycling Union (UCI) from competing in the UCI Road World Championships in Stuttgart but Valverde was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport to compete at the championships. Dick Pound, World Anti-Doping Agency president, said the CAS decision did not mean that Valverde was no longer a suspect.\n\nIn early 2009 the Italian National Olympic Committee matched DNA samples taken from Valverde during a rest day in Italy of the 2008 Tour de France to plasma seized in the Operación Puerto investigation. At a February 2009 appearance in front of the Olympic Committee, Valverde maintained his innocence and questioned the Italians' jurisdiction over this case. In May 2009, the Italian Olympic Committee suspended him from competition in Italy for 2 years, effectively barring him from the 2009 Tour de France, which detoured briefly onto Italian soil. Valverde filed an unsuccessful appeal against the Italian ban with the Court of Arbitration for Sport; in a second hearing on 18–21 March 2010, the UCI and WADA contested the Spanish Cycling Federation's decision not to open a case against Valverde.\n\nFinally, on 31 May 2010 it was announced the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the appeals from WADA and the UCI and Valverde was banned for two years, starting 1 January 2010, but rejected the request that any results obtained by the athlete prior to the beginning of the suspension be annulled. After serving the two-year suspension Alejandro Valverde returned to competition in 2012 riding for the .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2219632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219632", "title": "Heavens Above!", "text": "Heavens Above!\n\nHeavens Above! is a 1963 British satirical comedy film starring Peter Sellers, directed by John and Roy Boulting, who also co-wrote along with Frank Harvey, from an idea by Malcolm Muggeridge. It is in much the same vein as the earlier collaboration between Sellers, Harvey and the Boultings, \"I'm All Right Jack\".\n\nA naive but caring prison chaplain, John Smallwood (Sellers), is accidentally assigned as vicar to the small and prosperous English country town of Orbiston Parva, in place of an upper-class cleric (Carmichael) with the same name, who is favoured by the Despard family, who practically run the town and operate a large factory there.\n\nSmallwood's belief in charity and forgiveness sets him at odds with the locals, whose assertions that they are good, Christian people are belied in Smallwood's eyes by their behaviour and ideas. He creates social ructions by appointing a black dustman (Peters) as his churchwarden, taking in a gypsy family, and persuading local landowner Lady Despard (Jeans) to provide food for the church to distribute free to the people of the town.\n\nHis scheme spirals out of control and very soon the local traders are up in arms as they have lost all their customers. He tries to explain this to the residents but is besieged in the church hall and only just rescued by the police.\n\nAs a face-saving act, the Bishop appoints the 'original' Smallwood to the parish and assigns the 'troublemaker' to the Scottish island of 'Ultima Thule'. He is made 'Bishop of Outer Space' to the British space operations based there. But when the intended pilot of the first rocket gets cold feet, Smallwood takes his place. He is last heard broadcasting a sermon over the rocket's radio.\n\nThe cast includes several noteworthy uncredited performers: \"A Hard Day's Night\" actor John Junkin, Rodney Bewes, who has a couple of lines as a milkman, and future Small Faces and Humble Pie singer Steve Marriott. Sellers's performance is generally held to be outstanding, in a meatier, more dramatic role, similar to his work in \"I'm All Right Jack\", released in 1959.\n\nThe film premiered in London on 23 May 1963 at the Columbia Cinema in Shaftesbury Avenue (today known as Curzon Soho), and although it disappointed the critic for \"The Times\", who found it lacking the mild bite and satire of the Boulting-Sellers film \"I'm All Right Jack\", it became one of the 12 most popular films in Britain in 1963.\n\nAn article in \"Garden History\" likened the character of the Reverend John Smallwood to that of an 18th-century picturesque guru William Gilpin: \"The first act of the new reverend is to invite a group of colourful travellers to reside in the vicarage; the second is to convince an old lady to open her house and grounds to all sorts of poor vagabonds, scruffs and vagrants, characters who bring picturesque values to the noble scene. Eventually, a picturesque economic system based on free donation causes havoc in the village and the nation - the reverend is made a bishop and sent into space, in Britain's first spaceship. The film revives a character that one can safely imagine as a modern version of Doctor Syntax - cordial, dedicated, stubborn, fearless, not reacting against, but slightly diverging from, the established values of his culture.\"\n\nLike other Boulting films, \"Heavens Above!\" satirises contemporary materialistic attitudes and cautiously espouses a socialist ethos, while also showing the possible deleterious side-effects of such ideas, and the all-too-human tendency to take advantage of naive generosity.\n\n"}

Headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel and San Carlos, California, the company has development centers in Israel and Belarus and previously held in United States (ZoneAlarm), Sweden (former Protect Data development centre) following acquisitions of companies who owned these centers. The company has offices in over 70 locations worldwide including main offices in North America, 10 in the United States (including in San Carlos, California and Dallas, Texas), 4 in Canada (including Ottawa, Ontario) as well as in Europe (London, Paris, Munich, Madrid) and in Asia Pacific (Singapore, Japan, Bengaluru, Sydney) .\n\nCheck Point was established in Ramat-Gan, Israel in 1993, by Gil Shwed (CEO ), Marius Nacht (Chairman ) and Shlomo Kramer (who left Check Point in 2003). Shwed had the initial idea for the company's core technology known as stateful inspection, which became the foundation for the company's first product, FireWall-1; soon afterwards they also developed one of the world's first VPN products, VPN-1. Shwed developed the idea while serving in the Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces, where he worked on securing classified networks.\n\nInitial funding of US$250,000 was provided by venture capital fund BRM Group. \n\nIn 1994 Check Point signed an OEM agreement with Sun Microsystems, followed by a distribution agreement with HP in 1995. The same year, the U.S. head office was established in Redwood City, California.\n\nBy February 1996, the company was named worldwide firewall market leader by IDC, with a market share of 40 percent.\nIn June 1996 Check Point raised $67 million from its initial public offering on NASDAQ.\n\nIn 1998, Check Point established a partnership with Nokia, which bundled Check Point's Software with Nokia's computer Network Security Appliances.\n\nIn 2003, a class action lawsuit was filed against Check Point over violation of the Securities Exchange Act by failing to disclose major financial information.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century Check Point started acquiring other IT security companies, including Nokia's network security business unit in 2009.\n\nIn 2019, researchers at Check Point found a security breach in Xiaomi phone apps. The security flaw was reported preinstalled.\n\nCheck Point is presently focused on what it calls \"fifth generation cyber security,\" or “Gen V.” It identifies the fifth generation as focused on large-scale and fast moving attacks across mobile, cloud and on-premise networks that easily bypass the conventional, static detection-based defenses being used by most organizations today.\n\nOver the years many employees who worked at Check Point have left to start their own software companies. These include Shlomo Kremer, who started Imperva; Nir Zuk, who founded Palo Alto Networks; Ruvi Kitov and Reuven Harrison of Tufin; and Yonadav Leitersdorf, who founded Indeni.\n\nCheck Point offers the following primary products:\n\n\nIn 2005, Check Point tried to acquire intrusion prevention system developers Sourcefire for $225 million, but later withdrew its offer after it became clear US authorities (specifically, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\n) would try to block the acquisition.\n\nSofaWare Technologies was founded in 1999, as a cooperation between Check Point and SofaWare's founders, Adi Ruppin and Etay Bogner, with the purpose of extending Check Point from the enterprise market to the small business, consumer and branch office market. SofaWare's co-founder Adi Ruppin said that his company wanted to make the technology simple to use and affordable, and to lift the burden of security management from end users while adding some features. In 2001 SofaWare began selling firewall appliances under the SofaWare S-Box brand; in 2002 the company started selling the Safe@Office and Safe@Home line of security appliances, under the Check Point brand. By the fourth quarter of 2002 sales of SofaWare's Safe@Office firewall/VPN appliances had increased greatly, and SofaWare held the #1 revenue position in the worldwide firewall/VPN sub-$490 appliance market, with a 38% revenue market share.\n\nRelations between Check Point and the SofaWare founders went sour after the company acquisition in 2002. In 2004 Etay Bogner, co-founder of SofaWare, sought court approval to file a shareholder derivative suit, claiming Check Point was not transferring funds to SofaWare as required for its use of SofaWare's products and technology. His derivative suit was ultimately successful, and Check Point was ordered to pay SofaWare 13 million shekels for breach of contract.\nIn 2006 the Tel Aviv District Court Judge ruled that Bogner SofaWare could sue Check Point by proxy for $5.1 million in alleged damage to SofaWare. Bogner claimed that Check Point, which owned 60% of Sofaware, had behaved belligerently, and withheld monies due for use of SofaWare technology and products Check Point appealed the ruling, but lost.\n\nIn 2009 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a group of founders of SofaWare, which includes Bogner, had veto power over any decision of SofaWare. The court ruled that the three founders could exercise their veto power only as a group and by majority rule.\n\nIn 2011 Check Point settled all litigation relating to SofaWare. As part of the settlement it acquired the SofaWare shares held by Bogner and Ruppin, and began a process of acquiring the remaining shares, resulting in SofaWare becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\n\n"}

It has been a frequent subject of artists and sculptors, particularly during the Renaissance and post-Renaissance eras\n\nThe word \"rape\" is the conventional translation of the Latin word used in the ancient accounts of the incident. Modern scholars tend to interpret the word as \"abduction\" or \"kidnapping\" as opposed to a sexual assault. Controversy remains, however, as to how the acts committed against the women should be judged.\n\nAccording to Roman historian Livy, the abduction of Sabine women took place in the early history of Rome shortly after its founding in the mid-8th century BC and was perpetrated by Romulus and his predominately male followers; it is said that after the foundation of the city, the population consisted solely of male bandits, Latins, and other Italic peoples. With Rome growing at such a steady rate in comparison to its neighbors, Romulus became concerned with maintaining the city's strength. His main concern was that with few women inhabitants there would be no chance of sustaining the city's population, without which Rome might not last longer than a generation. On the advice of the Senate, the Romans then set out into the surrounding regions in search of wives to establish families with. The Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with all the peoples that they appealed to, including the Sabines, who populated the neighboring areas. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans. Consequently, the Romans devised a plan to abduct the Sabine women during the festival of Neptune Equester. They planned and announced a festival of games to attract people from all the nearby towns. According to Livy, many people from Rome's neighboring towns—including Caeninenses, Crustumini, and Antemnates—attended the festival along with the Sabines, eager to see the newly established city for themselves. At the festival, Romulus gave a signal by \"rising and folding his cloak and then throwing it round him again,\" at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. In total, thirty Sabine women were abducted by the Romans at the festival. All of the women abducted at the festival were said to have been virgins except for one married woman, Hersilia, who became Romulus' wife and would later be the one to intervene and stop the ensuing war between the Romans and the Sabines. The indignant abductees were soon implored by Romulus to accept the Roman men as their new husbands.\n\nOutraged at what had happened, the king of the Caeninenses entered upon Roman territory with his army. Romulus and the Romans met the Caeninenses in battle, killed their king, and routed their army. Romulus later attacked Caenina and took it upon the first assault. Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to Jupiter Feretrius (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as \"spolia opima\". According to the \"Fasti Triumphales\", Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.\n\nAt the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the \"Fasti Triumphales\", Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates.\n\nThe Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town was captured.\n\nRoman colonists were subsequently sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women).\n\nThe Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, Titus Tatius. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of Tarpeia, daughter of Spurius Tarpeius, Roman governor of the citadel on the Capitoline Hill. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for \"what they bore on their arms\", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was buried on or thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the Tarpeian Rock.\n\nThe Romans attacked the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by Hostus Hostilius, the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. The Romans retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men, promising to build a temple to Jupiter Stator on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning.\n\nAt this point in the story, however, the Sabine women intervened:\n\nThe battle came to an end, and the Sabines agreed to unite in one nation with the Romans. Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later.\n\nThe new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.\n\nThe motivation behind the abduction of the Sabine women is contested among ancient sources. Livy writes that Rome's motivation for abducting the Sabine women was solely to increase the city's population and claims that no direct sexual assault took place during the abduction. Livy says that Romulus offered the Sabine women free choice as well as civic and property rights. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to each of them in person, declaring \"that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and—dearest of all to human nature—would be the mothers of freemen.\" Scholars like Dionysius of Halicarnassus argue that it was an attempt to secure an alliance with the Sabines through the women's newly founded relationships with Roman men. Livy's account is reinforced in some ways through the works of Cicero. In Cicero's work \"De re publica\", he reiterates Livy's view that the plan to abduct the Sabine women at the festival was done in order \"to strengthen the new state\" and \"safeguard the resources of his kingdom and people.\" Unlike Livy, Cicero, and Dionysius, Ovid sees the abduction of the Sabine as an avenue for the men of Rome to fulfill their sexual desires rather than an attempt at taking wives to produce children for the city. While he does make note of the issue surrounding Rome's lack of women, he does not make it out to be a factor in the planning of the abduction.\n\nMany treatments of the legend combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-nude figures in intensely passionate struggle.\n\nThe subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme. It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian \"cassoni\" and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the New Testament was afforded by the theme of the Massacre of the Innocents.\n\nThe 16th-century Italo-Flemish sculptor Giambologna sculpted a representation of this theme with three figures (a man lifting a woman into the air while a second man crouches), carved from a single block of marble. This sculpture is considered Giambologna's masterpiece. Originally intended as nothing more than a demonstration of the artist's ability to create a complex sculptural group, its subject matter, the legendary rape of the Sabines, had to be invented after Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, decreed that it be put on public display in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Piazza della Signoria, Florence.\n\nThe proposed site for the sculpture, opposite Benvenuto Cellini's statue of Perseus, prompted suggestions that the group should illustrate a theme related to the former work, such as the rape of Andromeda by Phineus. The respective rapes of Proserpina and Helen were also mooted as possible themes. It was eventually decided that the sculpture was to be identified as one of the Sabine virgins.\n\nThe work is signed (\"The work of Johannes of Boulogne of Flanders, 1582\"). An early preparatory bronze featuring only two figures is in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte in Naples. Giambologna then revised the scheme, this time with a third figure, in two wax models now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The artist's full-scale gesso for the finished sculpture, executed in 1582, is on display at the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence.\n\nThe woman and the kneeling man reference figures from the ancient sculpture \"Laocoön and His Sons\".\n\nBronze reductions of the sculpture, produced in Giambologna's own studio and imitated by others, were a staple of connoisseurs' collections into the 19th century.\n\nNicolas Poussin produced two major versions of this subject. His initial version was entitled \"The Abduction of the Sabine Women\" and was most likely completed around 1633–1634. The painting depicts Romulus giving the signal to the Romans for the abduction. According to the Met, the subject matter of Poussin's work allowed him to highlight his understanding of pose and gesture as well as his knowledge of Roman architecture. This version of the painting currently resides at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\n\nPoussin's second version, entitled \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\", is essentially a recreation of his original work and was likely completed around 1637–1638. The architectural setting of this work is more developed than in the original. This painting currently resides in the Louvre Museum in Paris. According to the Louvre, painting multiple version of one subject was not uncommon throughout Poussin's career.\n\nPeter Paul Rubens painted his version of \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\" around 1635–40. It now resides in the National Gallery, London. The painting depicts the moment Romulus gave the signal for the Romans to abduct the Sabine women. Rubens emphasizes the violence of the abduction and sexualizes it by depicting women with exposed breasts and a soldier lifting up a woman's skirt.\n\nJohann Heinrich Schönfeld painted a version of this subject entitled \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\" in the late 1630s. His work now resides at the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.\n\nJacques Stella painted a version of the Rape of the Sabine Women entitled \"The Rape of the Sabines\" in the mid-17th century. Stella's depiction of the scene is said to have so closely resembled Nicholas Poussin's works that following his death his version was mistaken for a Poussin. This work now resides at Princeton University's Art Museum.\n\nJacques-Louis David painted the other end of the story, when the women intervene to reconcile the warring parties. \"The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running Between the Combatants\" (also known as \"The Intervention of the Sabine Women\") was completed in 1799. It is in the Louvre Museum.\n\nDavid had begun work on it in 1796, when France was at war with other European nations, after a period of civil conflict culminating in the Reign of Terror and the Thermidorian Reaction, during which David himself had been imprisoned as a supporter of Robespierre. After David's estranged wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the French people to reconcile their differences after the bloodshed of the French Revolution.\n\nThe painting depicts Romulus's wife Hersilia — the daughter of Titus Tatius, leader of the Sabines — rushing between her husband and her father and placing her babies between them. A vigorous Romulus prepares to strike a half-retreating Tatius with his spear, but hesitates. Other soldiers are already sheathing their swords.\n\nThe rocky outcrop in the background is the Tarpeian Rock.\n\nThe English 19th-century satirical painter John Leech included in his \"Comic History of Rome\" a depiction of the Rape of the Sabine Women, where the women are portrayed, with a deliberate anachronism, in Victorian costume and being carried off from the \"Corona et Ancora\" (\"Crown and Anchor\", a common English pub sign in seafaring towns).\n\nEdgar Degas painted \"The Rape of the Sabines\" (after Poussin), c. 1861–1862.\n\n\"The masters must be copied over and over again\", Degas said, \"and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature.\" Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen. He was most interested in the great works of the Italian Renaissance and of his own classical French heritage, hence this detailed copy of Poussin's painting.\nCharles Christian Nahl painted the subject in a trio of works entitled \"The Abduction\", \"The Captivity\", and \"The Invasion\".\n\nPablo Picasso visited this theme in his several versions of the \"Rape of the Sabine Women\" (1962–63), one of which is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. These are based on David's version. These conflate the beginning and end of the story, depicting the brutish Romulus and Tatius ignoring and trampling on the exposed figure of Hersilia and her child.\n\nThe episode of the Rape of the Sabine Women is recounted by Cicero, Livy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Plutarch. The poetry of Ovid also contains several allusions to this episode.\n\nThe midrash \"Sefer haYashar\" (first attested in 1624) portrays the story as part of a war between the Sabines, descended from Tubal, and the Roman Kittim (). A more detailed version of this narrative is found in the earlier mediaeval rabbinic work \"Yosippon\".\n\nThe story was parodied by Lady Carlotta, the mischief-making character in Saki's short story \"The Schartz-Metterklume Method\".\n\nStephen Vincent Benét wrote a short story called \"The Sobbin' Women\" that parodied the legend. Later adapted into the 1954 musical \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\", it tells the story of seven gauche but sincere backwoodsmen, one of whom gets married, encouraging the others to seek partners. After a social where they meet girls they are attracted to, they are denied the chance to pursue their courtship by the latter's menfolk. Following the Roman example, they abduct the girls. As in the original tale, the women are at first indignant but are eventually won over.\n\nIn 1962, a Spanish \"sword and sandal\" film based on the story was made, directed by Alberto Gout. Titled \"El Rapto de las Sabinas,\" the film was released in the USA under the titles \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\" and \"The Shame of the Sabine Women.\"\n\nTom Stoppard's play \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" (1966) features a group of all-male players offering to put on a performance of \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\", to the disgust of the title characters.\n\nThe latest adaptation is a film without dialogue, \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\", which was produced in 2005 by Eve Sussman and the Rufus Corporation.\n\nScholars have cited parallels between the Rape of the Sabine Women, the Æsir–Vanir War in Norse mythology, and the \"Mahabharata\" from Hindu mythology, providing support for a Proto-Indo-European \"war of the functions\". Regarding these parallels, J. P. Mallory states:\n\n\n\n"}

Institute of Applied Art is an Indian applied art institution based in Mumbai. It is a state government college that was created through its sister school, the Sir J. J. School of Art. The \"Sir J. J.\" in the name stands for Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy, a Parsi philanthropist whose name is linked to numerous historical institutions of Mumbai, such as the Sir J. J. Hospital. In 1958, Sir J. J. School of Art was divided, with the Departments of Architecture and Applied Art becoming the Sir J. J. College of Architecture and Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art respectively.\n\nThe Institute of Applied Art history first began with the founding of its sister school, the Sir J. J. School of Art. The school opened through the help of a donation by Jamsetji Jeejeebhai in 1857.\n\nDuring the Second World War the school was threatened with closure. At the time the school was run by the British Bombay government and its funding came directly from the government. In preparation for the looming war many committees were set up to review excess government expenditure and divert money to defense needs. The close scrutiny of one such \"Thomas Committee\" fell on the Sir J. J. School of Art. The committee recommended that the school be shut down, claiming that it only contributed to furthering personal talents of artists and was of no use to society in general.\n\nThe director of the J. J. School of Art set out to rectify the situation. In 1935 Mr. Soloman was the dean of J.J. In 1946, J. J. School of Art started a new department, the Commercial Art Section, or CAS. The objective of this division was to impart all of the necessary training in art with an eye on students being able to exploit this training for commercial purposes. A direct contribution of this section was to aid the war preparations of the government by designing propaganda and public awareness posters. This exercise was a huge success. Therefore, the government decided not to shut down the Sir J. J. School of Art. The students trained at the CAS soon found that they were in considerable demand from the commercial industries of Mumbai (then Bombay) to design publicity material. Also, the fledgling advertising industry lapped up talent from the CAS, creating a set of people who would end up being counted among the founders of Indian advertising.\n\nThe CAS became popular among applicants to the Sir J.J. School of Art, as it offered a direct means of earning a livelihood to skilled artists who had completed the course. Soon, this once-small section of the school began receiving more student applications than the main part of the institute. At this time India had gained independence. The government, which still ran the school, separated the CAS from the rest of the school and create the Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art. Professor V.N. Adarkar was named the institutes first principal and later went on to become its first dean.\n\nThe Institute's first dean was V. N. Adarkar. Notable deans in recent years have been H. G. Hanmante, Prof. Kamat and M. G. Rajadhyaksha.\n\nOver the years, Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art has been involved with several projects on social awareness that include \"Know the Five-Year Plan \"in the 1950s, \"Our Himalayas\" during the 1963 Sino-Indian War, and the \"International Tourist Fair — Bombay\" in 1965.\n\nThe current course leads to successful students receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Applied Art from Mumbai University. The total duration of this course is four years, with the first year referred to as a \"Foundation\" year, and the later three being referred to as \"Specialization\" years. A student chooses his or her area of major specialization from amongst areas such as Illustration, Photography, Typography, Exhibition Display or Computer Graphics.\n\nThe Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art provides more than half of the Indian advertising industry's top art talent. There is a widely held belief among past professors of the institute, as well as art educators, that it would be best for the future health of the institution if the state government grants autonomy to the institute. This would clear the way to a much-needed revamp of the quality of teaching and infrastructure and bring modern day requirements to the school.\n\nThe campus is located in south-Mumbai (opposite VT station) and houses the Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art, the Sir J. J. School of Art, Sir J. J. College of Architecture, and the Government Institute of Printing Technology. The campus contains many trees that are more than a century old, and houses numerous heritage buildings.\n\nThe most renowned building on the campus is the century-and-half-old wood and stone bungalow that was Rudyard Kipling's birthplace. An ornate metal plaque at the entrance of this house is engraved with the words, \"Rudyard Kipling, son of Lockwood Kipling, first principal of Sir J. J. School of Art, was born here on 30.12.1865.\" Traditionally the home of the deans for both the Sir J. J. School of Art and Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art, this identically-split-bungalow attracts numerous Kipling-enthusiasts from all over the world. For decades now, the Kipling side of the bungalow has been the official Dean's Residence of the dean of Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art. During the tenure of the last residing dean, Prof. M. G. Rajadhyaksha, a bust of Rudyard Kipling was also unveiled at the entrance to this bungalow as homage to the legendary writer of works such as \"The Jungle Book\" and \"If—\".\n\n\n"}

He was married to actress Margaret Rutherford.\n\nStringer Davis was born on 4 June 1899 in Birkenhead, Cheshire, England. His father George Davis was a bank clerk, his mother Ethel a housewife. Davis attended the independent Uppingham School and received military basic training there. In August 1918, he volunteered for military service and was sent to the front in the First World War as a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment. He was discharged from military service in September 1919, about 10 months after the conclusion of the war.\n\nDavis's parents separated shortly after his return from the war. His mother lived in a spacious house in Reading, Berkshire, and Davis lived in its vicinity in a boathouse overlooking the River Thames. He began his theatrical career as a member of the Oxford Repertory Company, working as both an actor and director. In 1930, he met Margaret Rutherford, his future wife, for the first time. At the time, Rutherford was still largely unknown. She wrote in her autobiography about her first encounter with her husband-to-be: \"I noticed his bright blue eyes, his casual elegant clothes and his polite way. I couldn't take my eyes off him...He had that special something. His name was Stringer Davis.\" He made his on-screen debut in a BBC television live drama \"Charles and Mary\" in 1938.\n\nThe 40-year-old Davis put aside his acting career to volunteer again for military service in 1939. He served as a lieutenant in the East Yorkshire Regiment and later was part of the British Expeditionary Force deployed in France. He participated in the Battle of Dunkirk and was one of the many British soldiers evacuated on 4 June, 1940. Davis remained with the army until almost the end of the Second World War, with tours of duty in North Africa and Northwest Europe.\n\nAfter the war, Davis resumed his acting career with the film \"Miranda\" (1948), which also featured Rutherford. Overall, Davis appeared in more than 20 films with his wife. In later years, she made it a condition of her contract that Davis would play a part in any film in which she appeared. Most notably, this clause led to Davis being cast as the mild-mannered librarian Mr Stringer in four adaptations of Agatha Christie novels featuring Rutherford as Miss Marple in the early 1960s. The gentle, timid Mr Stringer was Davis's most celebrated role, gaining good reviews.\n\nDavis married Margaret Rutherford in 1945 after a 15-year courtship. She was 53 and he was 46 at the time. Reportedly, his mother was the main reason for the long engagement because she was adamantly opposed to having Margaret Rutherford for a daughter-in-law. Only after the death of Ethel Davis did the duo finally marry. Once the two married, they remained totally devoted to one another, with Davis always at hand behind the camera whenever his wife was filming.\n\nTowards the end of her life Margaret Rutherford was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and Davis tended to her throughout a long and distressing illness. Rutherford died on 22 May 1972, aged 80.\n\nDavis died peacefully in his sleep in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire in 1973, one year after Rutherford's death. Rutherford and Davis are interred in the graveyard of St James's Church, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications), as part of a duopoly with Inglewood-licensed Ion Plus owned-and-operated station KILM (channel 64). The two stations share offices on West Olive Avenue in Burbank and transmitter facilities atop Mount Wilson.\n\nChannel 30 first signed on the air as KHOF-TV on October 16, 1969. It originally operated as a Christian broadcast outreach of the Faith Center Church in Glendale, of which Reverend Raymond Schoch served as the pastor, with Paul Crouch (who would leave in 1972 in order to begin his own Trinity Broadcasting Network) as his assistant and general manager. KHOF was the second full-time Christian television station. WYAH in Virginia Beach was the first Christian station in 1961, but beginning in 1967, that station began a very gradual evolution to a conventional commercial independent television station (which they completed in 1973). KHOF ran a mix of Schoch's own sermons, various televangelists and teaching programs, both local and syndicated. The church already owned and operated KHOF-FM radio (now KKLA) in Los Angeles. The station began to have competition when their former GM Paul Crouch left in 1972 and acquired newly purchased KLXA Channel 40 in 1974. \n\nA year later, in 1975, Schoch stepped down for health reasons, and would pass away on September 26, 1977. Dr. Gene Scott took over the ministry in 1975 and his Christian views were evolving, as reflected in his sermons. As the decade went on, KHOF gradually shifted away from syndicated Christian shows and local Christian programs to only in-house programming from Scott. Their church broke up as well, and the original Faith Center Church eventually shut down and merged with other churches while Scott had his own congregation. By 1980, the station, along with the radio stations and other TV stations owned by Faith Center, was running only Scott's discussions and sermons full-time. By 1981, the Faith Center was renamed the University Network. In the 1980s, KHOF came under the scrutiny of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) because of its fundraising operations, as well as Scott's refusal to allow the FCC to examine his station's financial records. The FCC eventually revoked KHOF-TV's license. After losing court challenges to the FCC action, KHOF-TV shut down on May 24, 1983. The final broadcast from Scott's channel 30 consisted of a number of cymbal-banging monkey toys termed as \"The FCC Monkey Band\" playing their mini-cymbals as a final attack against the commission.\n\nIn order to keep channel 30 from going dark until a new permanent licensee could be selected from the many applications that the FCC anticipated, they decided to allow an interim broadcaster to operate on the channel. In 1984, Angeles Broadcasting was granted an interim license and in January 1985, returned channel 30 to the air as KAGL-TV. The station continued to broadcast religious programming from Gene Scott as well. Because KAGL utilized the old KHOF transmitter, still owned by Faith Center, KAGL provided Dr. Scott four hours of evening time and some daytime hours to continue the \"Festival of Faith\" programs he televised on KHOF. In 1992, the FCC shut down KAGL in order to allow new licensee Sandino Communications (an investor group whose name is shorthand for the city of license of San Bernardino) to construct a new transmitter for a planned television station under the KZKI call letters.\n\nThe current channel 30 signed on the air on January 7, 1994 as KZKI, airing a mix of religious programs, infomercials, and some movies in the four years between that time and the launch of Pax TV (later i: Independent Television, now Ion Television) on August 31, 1998. Sandino sold KZKI to Paxson Communications (the forerunner to Ion Media Networks) in 1995 for $18 million in cash and the assumption of debt.\n\nKPXN's analog signal on UHF channel 30 was the last television station to transmit from Sunset Ridge in the Mount San Antonio range. At one time, KDOC (channel 56; now broadcasting from Mount Wilson), KSCI (channel 18) and KRCA (channel 62; both now transmitting from Mount Harvard) broadcast their signals from Sunset Ridge as well. \n\nUntil the expansion of Ion Television's schedule past 1 a.m. in early 2011, KPXN aired one hour of Bible teaching programs nightly at 1 a.m. from the Los Angeles University Cathedral, which is taught by Dr. Scott's widow, Melissa Scott. The program was part of Ion's national schedule via a time brokerage agreement.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKPXN-TV also operates a Mobile DTV feed of subchannel 30.1, labelled \"KPXN-ION\", broadcasting at 1.83 Mbit/s.\n\nKPXN-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 30, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 38, using PSIP to display KPXN-TV's virtual channel as 30 on digital television receivers.\n\nIn the late 1990s, as part of Pax TV's partnership to provide Pax's stations with newscasts from local NBC affiliates, KPXN began airing rebroadcasts of the weekday editions of NBC owned-and-operated station KNBC (channel 4)'s 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. newscasts. KPXN branded the 7:00 p.m. airing of channel 4's 6:00 newscast (which aired on a one-hour tape delay) as \"The Channel 4 News at 6 p.m. on PAX30,\" and the 11:30 p.m. airing of that station's late newscast (which aired on a half-hour delay) as \"The Channel 4 News at 11:30 on PAX30.\" KPXN stopped airing the newscasts in 2005, after Pax dissolved its pact with NBC.\n\n\n"}

It is a program of the Higher Education Services Corporation which is a New York State Agency.\n\nThe Tuition Assistance Program, better known as TAP, is an aid program that helps New York State residents going to college with their tuition. To become eligible for TAP, students must be United States citizens and New York State residents. With the TAP award, a student can earn from $500 to $5,000. Because TAP is a grant, the aid does not need to be repaid. There are several determining factors that influence how much aid students receive, such as family income and tax status (independent or dependent). Dependent students qualify for TAP if their family net tax income is below $80,000, and independent students who are married but have no parental income qualify if their income is below $40,000. Single independent students qualify for TAP if they have no parental income and their personal income is below $10,000. Other qualifications include number of college credits and grade point average for individuals who are already in school.\n\nThe Tuition Assistance Program is a part of a program called The Higher Education Services Corporation. The Higher Education Services program is a financial aid agency for college students. Tuition assistance is available for SUNY/CUNY colleges and can be used for tuition and fees for coursework related to students' majors. To apply for TAP, students can visit the financial aid website at FAFSA.gov. To apply students will first need the school name and code. If students are working part-time individuals can receive up to $1500, and if students are working full-time they can receive up to $3,000. If students are in school one must be a full-time student with at least a 2.0 average and taking 12 credits or more. Students will need to have a high school diploma and have graduated high school in the United States to be eligible for TAP. Also, according to the Higher Education Services Corporation, students must be charged at least $200 tuition per year.\n\nUndergraduate students who enroll in bachelors programs can receive four years of TAP if they are studying full-time. If students do not fulfill the requirements for the tuition assistance then they can lose their funding and can be forced to repay the aid for that course. If a student is unable to keep up with credits or grades (for example, if a student's grade point average is below a C- with fewer than 12 credits) then the student can lose the assistance. Because TAP is a state program, some states have appeal programs, allowing participants to explain why they could not meet the requirements. Some states do not have the appeal process. If a student drops a class that TAP is paying for, the student may need to pay the full amount for that course. TAP is an award and it will appear on a student’s financial aid award letter from the school the student is attending or planning to attend and from the New York State higher service corporation (NYSHESC). The letter states how much aid students will be getting. Undergraduate students are limited to only 8 semesters to receive TAP.\n\nIf students are in the HEOP program, which is the Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity program, then they are able to receive TAP for 10 semesters. To receive TAP students have to be studying a specific major and in an approved degree program. Each year the deadline to complete a TAP form is June 30. After filling out a FAFSA application, the website will provide a link to the TAP homepage to fill the application. Students will acquire a user ID and a pin number to apply and make changes.\n\nIn addition to the federal government's Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA), there are programs similar to TAP in other states. Each state has its own grant/scholarship program for college students. The qualifications in each program are the similar to TAP. Some examples of different state grant programs are California's Cal grant program, Cal Dream Act, and Georgia's HOPE grant program. Grants are also provided by the US Military. The military tuition assistance program is for students who are of a military family. The military tuition program helps to pay almost the full amount of a student’s tuition costs. The program pays semester hours that are $250 and less and only applies to active duty members.\n\n\n"}

He represented the England under-20 team in February 2003.\n\nA pacey, left-footed forward, he began his career at Reading, where he made his first team debut in April 2000. He had loan spells at Maidenhead United, Swansea City, Cheltenham Town, and Wycombe Wanderers, before he joined Wycombe Wanderers on a permanent transfer in March 2004. He averaged a goal every two games for Wycombe, and was sold on to Nottingham Forest for a £675,000 fee in January 2006. He spent five and a half seasons with Forest, and helped the club to win promotion out of League One in 2007–08. He moved on to Derby County in June 2011, and was loaned out to Millwall in January 2013. He signed with Blackpool in September 2013, and was loaned out to Fleetwood Town and Notts County after failing to win a first team place at Blackpool. He joined Doncaster Rovers in July 2014, and spent two seasons with the club before moving to Kilmarnock in 2016 for a year.\n\nTyson began his career at Reading as part of the youth academy, and made his first team debut on 29 April 2000, coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Darius Henderson in a 1–1 draw with Bury at Gigg Lane. In August 2001, he joined Swansea City of the Third Division on an initial one-month loan. On 29 September, he was sent off for a foul on goalkeeper Stuart Brock two minutes after coming on as a substitute in a 2–0 win over Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, though manager Colin Addison said that he intended to appeal the decision as Tyson was \"only a fraction from taking the ball\". Tyson scored his first goal in the Football League on 23 October, helping the \"Swans\" to a 2–0 win over Darlington at Vetch Field. He returned to the Third Division towards the end of the 2001–02 season, joining Cheltenham Town on loan in March 2002. Manager Steve Cotterill signed him to help the club push for the play-offs, and Tyson scored one goal from one start and seven substitute appearances in the league, but did not feature in the play-offs as the \"Robins\" went on to secure promotion with a 3–1 victory over Rushden & Diamonds in the play-off final.\n\nReading were promoted into the First Division in 2002, and Tyson managed to earn himself a place in the \"Royals\" first team in the 2002–03 season, scoring his first goal for the club in a 2–1 victory over Derby County on 28 December. Reading qualified for the play-offs at the end of the campaign, though Tyson was sent off in the play-off semi-final first leg defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers after fouling Paul Butler and then using abusive language.\n\nIn December 2003, Tyson joined Second Division side Wycombe Wanderers on a short-term loan, although had to return to Reading early the next month for treatment on a knee injury. After impressing manager Tony Adams, Tyson was signed for an undisclosed transfer fee in March 2004 and agreed a two-year contract. He finished as the club's top-scorer during the 2004–05 season with 22 goals in 42 league appearances, and also won the club's Player of the Year award. During the close season, Tyson was the subject of three bids from Sheffield Wednesday, all of which were turned down by Wycombe.\n\nHe began the 2005–06 season with 13 goals in 19 games, making him the top-scorer in the English leagues at the end of September. He was named as the League Two Player of the Month for August, having scored six times in six games. Sheffield Wednesday had a £700,000 bid accepted in October, but Tyson rejected the move. Tyson stated that he was \"flattered\" and said \"I'm not worth that. How many houses can you buy for £750,000?\" He was also linked with moves to Wolverhampton Wanderers and Hull City. His goal glut was quickly followed by a run of six games without a goal, which led manager John Gorman to claim that \"his attitude has been fantastic and he'll bounce straight back\".\n\nIn November 2005, Tyson joined League One side Nottingham Forest on loan until January, at which point he signed a permanent deal with the club for a fee of £675,000.

He was injured just minutes into Forest's opening game of the 2006–07 season against Bradford City on 5 August, which kept him out of action for three months. On 9 December, he scored an eight-minute first half hat-trick in a 4–1 win over Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. He ended the season with nine goals in 30 games. He scored 12 goals in 39 league and cup competitions in the 2007–08 season, helping Forest to secure runners-up spot in League One and thereby win promotion to the Championship.\n\nIn May 2008, he was the subject of a £750,000 bid from Bristol City, which was rejected. In January 2009, Tyson signed a new contract to keep him at the City Ground until the summer of 2011. On 22 January, he scored a volleyed goal to help Forest to beat Premier League side Manchester City 3–0 in the Third Round of the FA Cup. On 29 August 2009, Tyson waved a Nottingham Forest flag in front of the Derby fans after the final whistle of a 3–2 East Midlands derby victory. He was defended by manager Billy Davies but received a fine of £5,000 and a two-game suspended ban for the incident. He scored just four goals in 75 appearances in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons, though was often only entering the game as a substitute. He left the club in May 2011 after rejecting the offer of a new contract.\n\nIn June 2011, Tyson signed a three-year contract with Derby County. He made his \"Rams\" debut in a 2–1 win over former club Nottingham Forest on 17 September. However, he made only two brief appearances in the first half of the 2011–12 season after struggling with groin problems. He scored his first goal for the club in the opening game of the 2012–13 season against Scunthorpe United in the League Cup on 14 August, a match which Derby drew 5–5 and lost 6–7 on penalties. He scored his first league goal four days later, in a 2–2 draw with Sheffield Wednesday. After the match it was reported that fellow Championship side Huddersfield Town were interested in signing Tyson on loan. Tyson fell down the first team pecking order at Derby behind Conor Sammon, Chris Martin, Johnny Russell, and Mason Bennett.\n\nOn 16 January 2013, Tyson joined Millwall on loan until the end of the 2012–13 season. Manager Kenny Jackett said that \"he has experience of the division [Championship], which at times we've lacked, and he brings pace to our front line\". He made his \"lions\" debut as a half-time substitute in a 2–0 home defeat against Burnley on 19 January; during this game he picked up ligament damage, with an initial prognosis before a scan ruling him out for a month. He failed to score and only managed four appearances as he struggled with injuries during his time at The Den. He was transfer listed by Derby in May 2013. He stated that he was unhappy at finding this fact out through the media and said that manager Nigel Clough did not tell him that he was placed on the transfer list.\n\nIn September 2013, Tyson joined Championship club Blackpool on a free transfer, signing a one-year contract with an option of a second. On 21 November 2013, Nathan joined League Two side Fleetwood Town on loan until 1 January 2014. On 3 March 2014, he joined League One side Notts County on an initial one-month loan, which was later extended until the end of the season. He failed to score in either of his loan spells or for his parent club in a total of 25 appearances in the 2013–14 season.\n\nIn July 2014, Tyson signed a one-year contract with League One club Doncaster Rovers after impressing on a three-week trial. He triggered a one-year contract extension in April 2015, and said he \"rediscovered his love for football\" playing under Paul Dickov. He scored a hat-trick on the last day of the 2014–15 season, in a 5–2 win over Scunthorpe United at the Keepmoat Stadium on 3 May. This took him to a final tally of 14 goals in 44 games in all competitions to finish the season as the club's top-scorer, and he was also voted the club's Player of the Year. He then scored seven goals in 36 games in the 2015–16 season as Rovers were relegated into League Two. He lost his first team place to new-signing Gary McSheffrey in March 2016, and manager Darren Ferguson agreed to activate a release in Tyson's contract in June 2016 despite the striker only signing a new one-year contract three months earlier.\n\nHe joined Port Vale on trial in July 2016, and manager Bruno Ribeiro told the media that he would sign the player if the club's finances allowed it.\n\nTyson signed for Kilmarnock on 12 September 2016, having agreed a contract to the end of the 2016–17 season. Kilmarnock announced in their match programme on 5 April 2017 that Tyson had been released from his contract.\n\nOn 3 July 2017, Wycombe Wanderers announced that Tyson had returned to the club on trial. After playing in some of Wycombe's pre-season friendlies, it was announced on 25 July 2017 that Tyson had signed a one-year deal to return to Wycombe. On 23 April 2018, Tyson signed a one-year extension keeping him at Wycombe Wanderers until the summer of 2019.\n\nHe was released by Wycombe at the end of the 2018–19 season.\n\nOn 6 February 2003, Tyson scored both goals for England under-20's in a 2–1 win over Germany.\n\nSpeaking in 2002, Cheltenham Town manager Steve Cotterill stated that \"he is very quick and his main asset is his pace\". Writing for \"The Guardian\" in October 2005, David Pleat said that \"as a speedy, left-footed goalscorer Tyson is a rarity in the modern game\" who made \"well-timed runs\", particularly for through balls, and had determination to chase lost causes.\n\nTyson was a cousin to Mark Philo, who also played professional football for Wycombe Wanderers. In a 2005 interview, Tyson stated that he had a superstition that led to him dressing on his left side first, liked the music of Usher, and had an interest in cars.\n\n\n"}

It is an important ferry and naval port at the head of Souda Bay.\n\nSouda is to the east of central Chania, although the area in between is mostly built-up. The town is a relatively new settlement, built on what used to be salt beds and marshland. The Turks knew the area as 'Tuzla', their name for salt-beds. In the 1870s, they began to build a new settlement here which grew as the port expanded. Souda Bay is one of the deepest natural harbours in the Mediterranean and is easy to defend.\n\nNow Souda is the arrival point for ferries from Piraeus. There is also a naval base located in Souda and across the bay, for NATO, with military accommodation and hospital in the town. Much of the command, particularly for US forces, is found across the bay on the Akrotiri. A grain silo overshadows the centre of town. Perhaps because of its nature as a departure point and military town, it is not popular with tourists and can appear seedy and threatening. However it is well-served with shops of all types and some renowned fish restaurants in the old centre. \n\nThe Allied War Cemetery, mostly of soldiers from World War II, is found in Souda on the shore. There are 1,527 graves, mostly British with 447 New Zealanders and 197 Australians. Buried in the cemetery is the archaeologist John Pendlebury. Pendlebury was the curator at Knossos for the British School in Athens and had been continuing excavations in Crete until the war. He was executed by the Germans in 1941 whilst working for British Intelligence.\n\nSouda was the main town in the former municipality of the same name, with the town hall found in Souda itself. The municipal unit extends from Chania's hinterland (Souda, Nerokourou and Tsikalaria) along the coast, taking in the villages of Kalami and Megala Chorafia. The Mayor of Souda, , was Ioannis Perakis. Around 8,000 people live in the municipal unit, the majority in Souda itself. Due to the area's beautiful views across the sea and up to the White Mountains and its proximity to Chania, there is a great deal of pressure to build new houses and apartments. However, there has been some protection afforded by the restrictions of having a military base in the area.\n\nDuring World War II the Royal Navy heavy cruiser HMS \"York\" was disabled at Souda Bay by two Italian explosive motorboats (Italian: \"barchini esplosivi\") of the Italian Decima Flottiglia MAS, launched by destroyers \"Crispi\" and \"Sella\" on 26 March 1941. Six motorboats entered the bay, led by Lieutenant Luigi Faggioni, and attacked three targets in pairs; the first was \"York\", second the tanker \"Pericles\" and last another ship at anchor. Three of the attacking craft had various problems, either mechanical or human, due to the extreme temperature conditions, but the other three successfully attacked their targets. Two motorboats, packed with 330-kilogramme (667 lb) charges in the bows, struck \"York\" amidships, flooding both boiler rooms and one engine room. Two seamen were killed.\n"}

Taejo ruled from 918 to 943, achieving unification of the Later Three Kingdoms in 936.\n\nWang Geon was born in 877 to a powerful maritime merchant family based in Songak (modern Kaesong) as the eldest son of Wang Ryung (). He traced his ancestry to a noble Goguryeo clan. His ancestors were Goguryeo refugees who settled around Songak, accumulating great wealth through maritime trade and gaining control of the region, including the Ryesong River. During the Later Silla period, the northern regions, including Songak, were the strongholds of Goguryeo refugees, and Wang Geon's hometown of Songak would become the original capital of Later Goguryeo in 901.\n\nTaejo began his career in the turbulent Later Three Kingdoms (). In the later years of Silla, many local leaders and bandits rebelled against the rule of Queen Jinseong, who did not have strong enough leadership or policies to improve the condition of the people. Among those rebels, Gung Ye (궁예; 弓裔) of the northwestern region and Gyeon Hwon (견훤; 甄萱) of the southwest gained more power. They defeated and absorbed many of the other rebel groups as their troops marched against local Silla officials and bandits. In 895, Gung Ye led his forces into the far northwestern part of Silla, where Songdo was located. Taejo's father, Wang Yung (later Sejo of Goryeo), along with many local clans, quickly surrendered to Gung Ye. Wang Geon followed his father into service under Gung Ye, the future leader of Taebong, and he began his service under Gungye's command.\n\nWang Geon's ability as a military commander was soon recognized by Gung Ye, who promoted him to general and even regarded him as his brother. In 900, he led a successful campaign against local clans and the army of Later Baekje in the Chungju area, gaining more fame and recognition from the king. In 903, he led a famous naval campaign against the southwestern coastline of Hubaekje (Keumsung, later Naju), while Gyeon Hwon was at war against Silla. He led several more military campaigns, and also helped conquered people who lived in poverty under Silla rule. The public favored him due to his leadership and generosity.\n\nIn 913, he was appointed as prime minister of the newly renamed Taebong. Its king, Gung Ye, whose leadership helped found the kingdom but who began to refer to himself as the Buddha, began to persecute people who expressed their opposition against his religious arguments. He executed many monks, then later even his own wife and two sons, and the public began to turn away from him. His costly rituals and harsh rule caused even more opposition.\n\nIn 918, four top-ranked generals of Taebong—Hong Yu (홍유; 洪儒), Bae Hyeongyeong (배현경; 裵玄慶), Shin Sung-gyeom (신숭겸; 申崇謙) and Bok Jigyeom (복지겸; 卜智謙)—met secretly and agreed to overthrow Gung Ye's rule and crown Wang Geon as their new king. Wang Geon first opposed the idea but later agreed to their plan. The same year Gung Ye was overthrown and killed near the capital, Cheorwon. The generals installed Wang Geon as the new king of this short-lived state. He renamed the kingdom Goryeo, thus beginning the Goryeo Dynasty. The next year he moved the capital back to his hometown, Gaegyeong.\n\nHe promoted Buddhism as Goryeo's national religion, and laid claim to the northern parts of the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria, which he considered his rightful legacy as the successor of Goguryeo. According to the Goryeosa, in 918, the ancient capital of Pyongyang had been in ruins for a long time and foreign barbarians were using the surrounding lands as hunting grounds and occasionally raiding the borders of Goryeo; therefore, in his first year as king, Wang Geon ordered his subjects to repopulate the ancient capital, and soon sent his cousin Wang Sik-ryeom to defend it. Afterward, he decreed Pyongyang as the Western Capital. He also sought alliances and cooperation with local clans rather than trying to conquer and bring them under his direct control.\n\nIn 927, Gyeon Hwon of Hubaekje led forces into Silla's capital, Gyeongju, capturing and executing its king, King Gyeongae. Then he established King Gyeongsun as his puppet monarch before he turned his army toward Goryeo. Hearing of the news, Taejo planned a strike with 5000 cavalrymen to attack Gyeon's troops on the way back home at Gongsan near Daegu. He met Hubaekje forces and suffered disastrous defeat, losing most of his army including his generals Kim Nak and Shin Sung-gyeom, the very same man who crowned Wang as a king. However, Goryeo quickly recovered from defeat and successfully defended Hubaekje's attack on its front.\n\nIn 935, the last king of Silla, King Gyeongsun, felt there was no way to revive his kingdom and surrendered his entire land to Taejo. Taejo gladly accepted his surrender and gave him the title of prince, and accepted his daughter as one of his wives (Wang had six queens, and many more wives as he married daughters of every single local leader). It caused much disgust to Gyeon Hwon. Gyeon's father, who held his own claim to the Sangju region, also defected and surrendered to Goryeo and was received as the father of a king.\n\nIn the same year, Gyeon Hwon's oldest son, Gyeon Singeom (), led a coup with his brothers Yanggeom and Yonggeom, against their father, who favored their half-brother, Geumgang, as his successor to the throne. Gyeon Hwon was sent into exile and imprisoned in Geumsansa, but escaped to Goryeo and was treated like Taejo's father, who died just before his surrender.\n\nIn 936, Wang led his final campaign against Singeom of Later Baekje. Singeom fought against Taejo, but facing much disadvantage and inner conflict, he surrendered to Taejo. Wang finally occupied Hubaekje formally, and unified the nation for the second time since Unified Silla; he ruled until 943, and died from disease.\n\nTaejo sought to bring even his enemies into his ruling coalition. He gave titles and land to rulers and nobles from the various countries he had defeated: Later Baekje, Silla, and also Balhae, which disintegrated around the same time. Thus he sought to secure stability and unity for his kingdom which had been lacking in the later years of Silla.\n\nAfter the destruction of Balhae by the Khitans in 926, Balhae's last crown prince and much of its ruling class sought refuge in Goryeo, where they were warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus uniting the two successor nations of Goguryeo. Taejo felt a strong familial kinship with Balhae, calling it his \"Relative Country\" and \"Married Country\", and protected Balhae refugees, many of whom were also of Goguryeo origin. This was in strong contrast to Later Silla, which had endured a hostile relationship with Balhae.\n\nTaejo displayed strong animosity toward the Khitans who had destroyed Balhae. The Liao dynasty sent 30 envoys with 50 camels as a gift in 942, but Wang Geon exiled the envoys and starved the camels under a bridge in retribution for Balhae, despite the major diplomatic repercussions. Taejo proposed to Gaozu of Later Jìn that they attack the Khitans as revenge for the destruction of Balhae, according to the Zizhi Tongjian. Furthermore, in his Ten Mandates to his descendants, he stated that the Khitans are no different than beasts and should be guarded against.\n\nThe unification of the Later Three Kingdoms in 936 was very important in Korean history; the unification of 668 CE by Silla was only a unification of approximately half of the peoples of the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity (who at the time largely considered themselves one people divided among many states), since the northern part was ruled by Balhae, which asserted itself as a reincarnation of Goguryeo. However, Wang Geon's unification in 936 was a more complete unification (in which only a single state emerged among the people, as opposed to the 7th century, when two, Later Silla and Balhae, emerged); the people of the Korean Peninsula thereafter remained under a single, unified state until 1948, when Korea was divided into north and south by Russian and U.S occupation forces.\n\nAs noted elsewhere in this article, the modern name of \"Korea\" is derived from the name \"Goryeo,\" which itself is derived from \"Goguryeo,\" to whose heritage (and by extension, territory) Wang Geon and his new kingdom laid claim. As the first ruler to more fully unite the people of the Korean Peninsula under a single state, many modern-day Koreans look to his example for applicability to the current state of division on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDuring the early Goryeo dynasty, the title of crown prince () was only a peerage title for sons of the king; a separate title existed for the heir apparent ().\n\n\n\n"}

First developed in 1992 the NCCUSL revised the act in 1996 and again in 2001 with additional amendments in 2008. The act limits the jurisdiction that can properly establish and modify child support orders and addresses the enforcement of child support obligations within the United States. In 1996, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (42 U.S.C. § 666), which required that states adopt UIFSA by January 1, 1998 or face loss of federal funding for child support enforcement. Every U.S. state has adopted either the 1996 or a later version of UIFSA.\n\nWhenever more than one state is involved in the establishing, enforcing or modifying a child or spousal support order, the act is implemented to determine the jurisdiction and power of the courts in the different states. The Act also establishes which state's law will be applied in proceedings under the Act, an important factor as support laws vary greatly among the states.\n\nThe Act establishes rules requiring every state to defer to child support orders entered by the state courts of the child's home state. The place where the order was originally entered holds continuing exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ), and only the law of that state can be applied to requests to modify the order of child support, unless the courts of that state no longer have original tribunal jurisdiction (CEJ) under the Act.\n\nThe Act also provides various direct interstate enforcement mechanisms. For example, it allows a caretaker parent to have an order mailed to the employer of the obligated parent, which will require that employer to withhold pay for the benefit of the child. Furthermore, it allows the caretaker parent to have an order mailed to an out-of-state court to get the other state to enforce the order.\n"}

Owned by the News-Press & Gazette Company, it is sister to Palm Springs-licensed ABC affiliate KESQ-TV (channel 42) and four other low-power stations: Class A Fox affiliate KDFX-CD (channel 33, licensed to both Indio and Palm Springs), Palm Springs-licensed CW affiliate KCWQ-LD (channel 2), Indio-licensed Telemundo affiliate KUNA-LP (channel 15), and low-powered AccuWeather affiliate KYAV-LD (channel 12). The six stations share studios on Dunham Way in Thousand Palms; KPSP-CD's transmitter is located on Edom Hill northeast of Cathedral City and I-10. \n\nAlong with other major Coachella Valley television stations, KPSP identifies itself on-air using its cable designation (CBS Local 2) rather than its over-the-air channel position. The unusual practice stems in part from the area's exceptionally high cable penetration rate of 80.5% which is one of the highest in the United States.\n\nIn addition to its own digital signal, KPSP is simulcast in standard definition on KESQ's second digital subchannel (virtual and UHF channel 42.2) from the same Edom Hill transmitter facility.\n\nThe station launched September 2, 2002 and aired an analog signal on UHF channel 38. Prior to its sign-on as the Coachella Valley's first ever CBS affiliate, programming from the network came into the market via cable or antenna (in some areas) through Los Angeles flagship owned-and-operated station KCBS-TV. When KPSP went on-the-air, area cable companies displaced KCBS at that outlet's request. KPSP adopted the \"CBS 2\" moniker following the practice of major local competitors in using its cable designation for branding purposes.\n\nOn April 1, 2008, it switched from branding itself \"CBS 2\" to \"KPSP Local 2\" although the \"CBS 2\" logo was retained for several months afterwards. On January 31, 2012, KPSP was sold by Desert Television to the News-Press & Gazette Company becoming a sister station to KESQ. It moved from its own studios on Dunham Way in Thousand Palms to KESQ's facility in Palm Desert. KPSP's transmitter on 38.1, went silent at midnight on March 1, 2012; the station's license was not initially included in the deal. CBS programming is now broadcast on 42.2 on the KESQ-DT digital tier and the lineup has not changed. In January 2013, News Press & Gazette acquired the KPSP-CD license, as well as KYAV-LD, from Desert Television. The Class A channel 38 digital transmitter was turned back on on February 7, allowing CBS programming to be shown over the air in 1080i high definition for the first time in nearly a year. NPG's acquisition of the Desert Television assets was completed on April 26.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nSyndicated programming on KPSP includes \"The Dr. Oz Show\" and \"Dr. Phil\" among others.\n\nAt one point while operating as a separate entity, KPSP aired its early weeknight newscast from 5:00 to 6:30 advertising the slot as a single 90-minute newscast. The \"CBS Evening News\" would therefore be seen in the regular time period at 6:30. The station would eventually move the \"CBS Evening News\" to 5:30 p.m.\n\nAfter KPSP was acquired by KESQ, this station had its operations temporarily merged into that outlet's facility. Local news offerings on both outlets were adjusted as a result. Later, both stations moved back to the Dunham Way location and operated separately out of different studios for seven years. On December 2, 2018, the \"CBS Local 2\" news brand was discontinued and all news offerings on CBS Local 2 were offered under a unified \"News Channel 3\" branding. The staff previously assigned to \"CBS Local 2\" newscasts were folded into the \"News Channel 3\" brand on all stations. On April 24, 2019, the space previously occupied by the \"CBS Local 2\" news set was launched with a new set supporting the local Telemundo affiliate's Spanish newscasts.\n\nFOX affiliate KDFX-CD airs a nightly hour prime time newscast at 10:00 produced by KESQ featuring the News Channel 3 branding and anchors. The program competes with low-powered MyNetworkTV affiliate KPSG-LP (now KPSE-LD), which had local news seen for thirty minutes at the same time produced by rival NBC affiliate KMIR-TV. \n\n\n\n"}

His mother Pauline née von Mihalovits was the daughter of a Hungarian noble family.\n\nHe received higher education in Leipzig, where his father had become manager of the Leipzig City Theatre in 1876. Soon after starting a banker's career in Berlin in 1882, Neumann came across the works of Arthur Schopenhauer. From 1884 he became absorbed in philosophical works and showed great interest for the Indian sources that had inspired Schopenhauer. He turned his back on banking and started to attend a college in Prague. By 1887 Neumann was back in Berlin, studying Indology, Religion and Philosophy at the university there.\n\nSoon after his marriage to Camilla née Nordmann from Vienna, Neumann went to Halle and in 1891 finished his thesis on a Pali text, his Ph. D. supervisor was Richard Pischel. In the same year he published \"Zwei buddhistische Suttas und ein Traktat Meister Eckharts\" (\"Two Buddhist Suttas and a treatise of Meister Eckhart\"). In 1892, after returning to Vienna, Neumann published an anthology of texts from the Pali Canon in German on the occasion of Schopenhauer’s 104th birthday. Having finished a translation of the Dhammapada in 1893, Neumann realized his great desire to visit the original countries of Buddhism. For a few months he traveled through India and Ceylon, meeting members of the sangha, such as the monk Sumangala Maha Thera and Lama Dondamdup. Besides praise for the knowledge and learning of monks, he also found critical words for what he considered an adulteration and watering down of the original teaching of the Buddha. Back in Vienna in 1894 he took up a post at the Oriental Institute of the University of Vienna as an assistant to the Indologist Georg Bühler.\n\nWithin the next few years, Neumann translated and published the Majjhima Nikāya in three volumes. In 1896 he began a friendship and lively correspondence with (18711957) from Bari. De Lorenzo translated Neumann's works into Italian and thus became one of the pioneers of Italian Buddhism.\n\nIn 1906 Neumann lost his fortune in a bank crash and even had to sell (temporarily) the highly esteemed Siamese edition of the Tipiṭaka, given to him as a present by Chulalongkorn, the king of Siam. His financial situation slightly improved through the legacy after his father's death. In 1907 he published the first volume of the Dīgha Nikāya with Piper publishers in Munich.\n\nNeumann died in poverty in 1915, and is buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery. His grave, forgotten and neglected for two generations, came to light again by the end of the twentieth century and is being attended to by the Buddhists of Vienna.\n\nToday, his translations are viewed as \"outdated in many respects\", but represent \"significant pioneering work\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2219785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219785", "title": "The Hum", "text": "The Hum\n\nThe Hum is a name often given to widespread reports of a persistent and invasive low-frequency humming, rumbling, or droning noise not audible to all people. Hums have been widely reported by national media in the UK and the United States, and sometimes named according to the locality where the problem has been particularly publicized: e.g., the \"Bristol Hum\", the \"Taos Hum\" and the \"Windsor Hum.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether it is a single phenomenon; different causes have been attributed. In some cases, it may be a manifestation of tinnitus.\n\nA study into the Taos Hum indicated that at least two percent could hear it; each hearer at a different frequency between 32 Hz and 80 Hz, modulated from 0.5 to 2 Hz. Similar results have been found in an earlier British study. It seems to be possible for hearers to move away from it, with one hearer of the Taos Hum reporting its range was . There are approximately equal percentages of male and female hearers. Age does appear to be a factor, with middle aged people being more likely to hear it.\n\nIn 2006, Tom Moir, then of Massey University in Auckland, New Zealand, believes he has made several recordings of the Auckland Hum. His previous research using simulated sounds had indicated that the hum was around 56 hertz.\n\nThere is skepticism as to whether it exists as a physical sound. In 2009, the head of audiology at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, David Baguley, said he believed people's problems with the hum were based on the physical world about one-third of the time, and stemmed from people focusing too keenly on innocuous background sounds the other two-thirds of the time. His current research focuses on using psychology and relaxation techniques to minimise distress, which can lead to a quieting or even removal of the noise.\n\nGeoff Leventhall, a noise and vibration expert, has suggested cognitive behavioral therapy may be effective in helping those affected. \"It's a question of whether you tense up to the noise or are relaxed about it. The CBT was shown to work, by helping people to take a different attitude to it.\"\n\nThere has been little mainstream attention. Only a handful of articles have been published in scientific literature, including:\nLeventhall, 2004, 2003;\nCowan, 2003; \nMullins & Kelly, 1998, 1995; \nBroner, 1978; \nVasudevan & Gordon, 1977. \nOther publications include:\nFox, 1989; \nWilson, 1979;\nHanlon, 1973.\n\nThe Hum has been reported worldwide.\n\nAlthough an obvious candidate, given the common description of the hum as sounding like a diesel engine, the majority of reported hums have not been traced to a specific mechanical source.\n\nIn the case of Kokomo, Indiana, a city with heavy industry, the origin of the hum was thought to have been traced to two sources. The first was a 36-hertz tone from a cooling tower at the local DaimlerChrysler casting plant and the second was a 10-hertz tone from an air compressor intake at the Haynes International plant. After those devices were corrected, however, reports of the hum persisted.\n\nTwo hums have been linked to mechanical sources. The West Seattle Hum was traced to a vacuum pump used by CalPortland to offload cargo from ships. After CalPortland replaced the silencers on the machine, reports of the hum ceased. Likewise, the Wellington Hum is thought to have been due to the diesel generator on a visiting ship. A 35 Hz hum in Windsor, Ontario, is likely to have originated from a steelworks on the industrial zone of Zug Island near Detroit.\n\nOne hum in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina was suspected of originating at a Santee Cooper substation almost 2 miles away from the home of a couple who first reported it. The substation is home to the largest transformer in the state. One local couple sued the power company for the disruption the hum was causing them. The hum was louder inside their house than out, in part, they believed, because their house vibrated in resonance to the 60 Hz hum. The volume of the hum was measured at up to 64.1 dB in the couple's home.\n\nSome sources claim that very low frequency radio waves or extremely low frequency radio waves that are used to communicate with submarines might be the source for the hum.\n\nA suggested diagnosis of tinnitus, a self-reported disturbance of the auditory system, is used by some physicians in response to complaints about the Hum. Tinnitus is generated internally by the auditory and nervous systems, with no external stimulus.\n\nWhile the Hum is hypothesized by some to be a form of low frequency tinnitus such as the venous hum, some report it is not internal, being worse inside their homes than outside. However, others insist that it is equally bad indoors and outdoors. Some people notice the Hum only at home, while others hear it everywhere they go. Some sufferers report that it is made worse by soundproofing (e.g., double glazing), which serves only to decrease other environmental noise, thus making the Hum more apparent.\n\nTinnitus is known to be exacerbated by allergens, which are regional and seasonal. Due to blockages, inflammation, and pressure inside the head, taking allergy medicine may help to mitigate the Hum.\n\nHuman ears generate their own noises, called spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAE). Various studies have shown that 38–60% of adults with normal hearing have them, although the majority are unaware of these sounds. The people who do hear these sounds typically hear a faint hissing (cicada insect like sound), buzzing or ringing, especially if they are otherwise in complete silence.\n\nResearchers who looked at the Taos Hum considered otoacoustic emissions as a possibility.\n\nOne of the many possible causes of the West Seattle Hum considered was that it was related to the midshipman fish, also known as a toadfish. A previous hum in Sausalito, California, also on the west coast of the United States, was determined to be the mating call of the male midshipman. However, in that case the hum was resonating through houseboat hulls and affecting the people living on those boats. In the West Seattle case, the University of Washington researcher determined that it would be impossible for any resonating hum, transmitted via tanker or boat hulls, to be transmitted very far inland; certainly not far enough to account for the reports.\n\nThe Scottish Association for Marine Science hypothesised that the nocturnal humming sound heard in Hythe, Hampshire in the UK could be produced by a similar \"sonic\" fish. The council believed this to be unlikely because such fish are not commonly found in inshore waters of the UK. As of February 2014, the source had not been located, although the sound has now been recorded.\n\nA case of \"hum\" in a house, reported in the \"Daily Telegraph\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 'Letters from Readers' on 18 January 2018, proved to be a wasps' nest in a hollow wall.\n\nThe Taos Hum was featured on the TV show \"Unsolved Mysteries\". It was also featured in \"LiveScience\"'s \"Top Ten Unexplained Phenomena\", where it took tenth place.\n\nBBC Radio 4 in the UK featured an investigation of the Hum phenomena in their \"Punt PI\" fact-based comedy programme.\n\n\n"}

He fought on the Aka Khel Expedition to the North-West Frontier in 1854, took part in the response to the Indian Rebellion in 1857 and, after serving as commandant of the penal settlement of the Andaman Islands, fought in the Second Anglo-Afghan War as Commander of the Quetta Army. In that role, he advanced through the Bolan Pass to Quetta, and then on to Kandahar in January 1879. In March 1880, he made a difficult march from Kandahar to Kabul, fighting on the way the Battle of Ahmed Khel and Battle of Arzu, and then holding supreme military and civil command in northern Afghanistan. He became Commander-in-Chief, India in April 1881 and a member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India in 1893.\n\nBorn the son of Robert Stewart and Flora Stewart (née Martin) at Mount Pleasant, near Forres, Moray in Scotland, Stewart was educated at schools at Findhorn, Dufftown and Elgin and at the University of Aberdeen.\n\nStewart was commissioned as an ensign in the 9th Bengal Native Infantry on 12 October 1840 and was promoted to lieutenant on 3 January 1844 and to captain on 1 June 1854. Later that year he served on the Aka Khel Expedition to the North-West Frontier.\n\nDuring the Indian Rebellion, after a famous ride from Agra to Delhi with dispatches, Stewart served as the deputy assistant adjutant-general at the Siege of Delhi in Summer 1857 and then as assistant adjutant-general at the Siege of Lucknow in Autumn 1857. After serving through the campaign in Rohilkhand he was promoted to major on 19 January 1858 and to lieutenant-colonel on 20 July 1858. He became deputy-adjutant-general of the Bengal Army in 1862 and, having been promoted to colonel on 20 July 1863, he commanded the Bengal brigade in the Abyssinian expedition in 1867. Promoted to major-general on 24 December 1868, he became commandant of the penal settlement of the Andaman Islands, and was present when one of the inmates assassinated Lord Mayo, British Viceroy of India, in 1872. After being exonerated in the subsequent inquiry, he was appointed Commander of the troops at Lahore in 1876.\n\nPromoted to lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877, Stewart commanded the Quetta Army during the Second Anglo-Afghan War advancing through the Bolan Pass to Quetta, and then on to Kandahar in January 1879. In March 1880, he made a difficult march from Kandahar to Kabul, fighting on the way the Battle of Ahmed Khel and Battle of Arzu, and then holding supreme military and civil command in northern Afghanistan. On hearing of the Maiwand disaster, he despatched Sir Frederick Roberts with a division on his celebrated march from Kabul to Kandahar, while he led the rest of the army back to India through the Khyber Pass. For this he was given the thanks of parliament and created a baronet.\n\nStewart became Military member of the Council of the Governor-General of India (effectively War Minister) in October 1880 and, having been promoted to full general on 1 July 1881, he became Commander-in-Chief, India in April 1881. In order to achieve efficiency savings he proposed merging the Bengal Army, Madras Army and Bombay Army into a single military force but this was rejected by the India Office. During the Panjdeh Incident in March 1885 he secured a significant increase in the number of British troops in India. He returned to London to become a member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India in 1893 and, in that role, again argued - this time successfully - for the creation of a single Indian Army. He was promoted to field marshal on 26 May 1894 and became a member of the Royal Commission on Indian civil and military expenditure as well as Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 1895 until his death on 26 March 1900. He died at Algiers in Algeria, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery in London.\nIn 1847 Stewart married Davina Marine; they went on to have two sons and three daughters. Lady Stewart was invested as a Companion of the Imperial Order of the Crown of India (CI) by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 6 March 1900.\n\nStewart's honours included:\n\n"}

He then joined Welsh side Cardiff City in 2006 for £275,000. He was part of the team that reached the 2008 FA Cup Final and was twice chosen as the club's Player of the Year in his three-year stint with the club.\n\nHe moved into the Premier League by signing for Birmingham City in 2009 for £5 million, with whom he won the 2011 League Cup. He departed Birmingham in 2011 after their relegation to join Midlands neighbours Wolverhampton Wanderers, with whom he suffered two further consecutive relegations, leading to his exclusion from first team involvement. After loan spells with Sheffield Wednesday and West Ham United, Johnson left Wolves by mutual consent, and spent the latter part of the 2014–15 season with Charlton Athletic. He played for Indian Super League club Pune City in 2015 before returning to Charlton in January 2016. Released at the end of the season, Johnson signed a short-term contract with Bromley in October 2017.\n\nJohnson spent time at Portsmouth and Bournemouth before joining Wycombe Wanderers as a 15-year-old, where he developed through the club's youth system. He made his first-team debut for Wycombe in the final game of the 1999–2000 season against Cambridge United, becoming the youngest ever player to make a Football League appearance for the club at the time, at the age of 17 years and 8 days. The following season, Johnson also made one substitute appearance, and was on the bench as Wycombe beat Premier League club Leicester City in the FA Cup quarter finals. The 2003–04 season saw Johnson in and out of the side under manager Tony Adams but he was still awarded the Fans' Player of the Year Award.\n\nAfter the departure of Adams after one season (6 months), Johnson became a regular in the side and was handed the captaincy by new manager John Gorman when he took over in November 2004, as well as finishing second in the player of the year award to forward Nathan Tyson.\n\nAfter 183 appearances and 22 goals for Wycombe, Johnson joined Cardiff City on 4 July 2006 for a fee of £275,000; Cardiff's local rivals Swansea City £100,000 bid was rejected.\n\nJohnson had a strong first year at Cardiff, and after spending the first six months as a regular substitute, began to form a dominant pairing with Dutchman Glenn Loovens which saw them keep club captain Darren Purse out of the side. In the 2007–08 season he began to score goals, with late winners against Norwich City in the League and Brighton & Hove Albion in the League Cup, as well as vital equalisers against Hull City and Preston North End. Johnson scored the second goal of Cardiff's memorable 2–0 away victory over Premier League Middlesbrough in the 2007–08 FA Cup quarter final, and his header in the Severnside Derby match against Bristol City in March 2008 was his seventh goal of the season. He played in all six of Cardiff's matches on their way to the FA Cup Final, in which they lost 1–0 to Portsmouth, and at the end of the season he was awarded the club's Player of the Year award.\n\nThe summer transfer window saw prolonged interest in Johnson; both Ipswich Town and West Bromwich Albion had bids rejected. Despite the interest Johnson remained with the side into the new season although he did see his centre-back partner Glenn Loovens leave to join Celtic. On the opening day of the season, Johnson scored a late winning goal against Southampton as Cardiff came away with a 2–1 win. Despite continued changes in his defensive partner, having played alongside Loovens, Purse and new signing Gábor Gyepes, who forced his way into the side past Purse in November, Johnson passed 100 appearances for the club, and had played every minute of the season until he had to leave the field during a 2–0 victory over Crystal Palace on 11 April 2009, after being hit in the throat by an elbow from Palace defender Claude Davis. After the incident Johnson suffered breathing difficulties and was forced to spend two nights in hospital as well as having daily checks throughout the following week. Davies was found guilty of violent conduct by the Football Association and banned for three matches. Johnson was forced to miss the next match, a 3–1 win over Burnley, but returned for the 6–0 defeat to Preston North End the following week. He was chosen as the club's player of the year for the second year running, and was named in the Championship Team of the Year.\n\nIn June 2009, after two previous bids had been rejected, Cardiff accepted an offer of £5m from Birmingham City. Johnson, described by former teammate Tony Capaldi as \"definitely captain material\", signed a three-year deal with the club on 25 June 2009, stating \"Premier League football is the dream at the start of any footballer's career so I am pleased I have been given that chance with Birmingham and I can't wait to get started.\" He made \"an impressive debut\" in Birmingham's first match of the season, a 1–0 defeat at Manchester United. He was part of the Birmingham team which went 12 games unbeaten, a club record for the top flight; at Christmas, \"The Times\"' correspondent Patrick Barclay described Johnson and defensive partner Scott Dann as \"the players of 2009–10 thus far\"; and Johnson was suggested as a possible England player. Johnson scored his first goal for the club away against Bolton Wanderers on 29 August 2010, and his second opened the scoring in the Second City derby against Aston Villa in January 2011.\n\nJohnson's header set up the opening goal for Nikola Žigić as Birmingham City defeated favourites Arsenal 2–1 to win the 2011 Football League Cup Final. The \"Daily Telegraph\" described him as \"an inspiring defensive presence throughout\".\n\nOn 11 July 2011, Birmingham accepted a bid from Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers for Johnson. Two days later, Johnson signed a four-year contract with Wolves. The fee was officially undisclosed, and the club claimed that reports of a £7m fee were inaccurate; the Wolverhampton-based \"Express & Star\" newspaper reported that the club had paid \"a flat fee with no add-ons\" of \"just over £4m\".\n\nJohnson was almost immediately handed the captaincy of Wolves by Mick McCarthy shortly before the start of the new season, relieving former captain Karl Henry of his duties. The season proved problematic for Johnson and his new team though and McCarthy was sacked in February 2012, following which Johnson said the players had let the manager down. After assistant manager Terry Connor was promoted to fill the vacancy, Johnson featured in only two further matches that season. During March 2012 he was disciplined by the club after turning up for training \"unfit to train properly\", widely reported as being due to alcohol; the player apologised for his conduct, and retained the captaincy. Later that same month, he had an on-field dispute with teammate Wayne Hennessey.\n\nWith the club relegated back to the Championship, new manager Ståle Solbakken brought Johnson back into the team. Solbakken was however dismissed in January 2013, and although Johnson retained his place in the team, once again the club were relegated, meaning Johnson had now been relegated in each of the last three seasons.\n\nWith the arrival of Kenny Jackett as Wolves manager, it was announced in June 2013 that Johnson was available for transfer and he was not issued with a squad number. No sale took place during the summer transfer window, and on 16 September, Johnson joined Championship club Sheffield Wednesday on loan for three months. He made 17 loan appearances before the deal expired, but Sheffield Wednesday caretaker manager Stuart Gray confirmed that he was attempting to extend the loan agreement.\n\nOn 6 January 2014, he joined Premier League club West Ham United on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season. Johnson played six games in all competitions for West Ham, his first coming on 8 January 2014 in a 6–0 away defeat to Manchester City in a semi-final of the League Cup.\n\nJohnson remained at Wolves, now back in the Championship, at the start of the 2014–15 season after the club received no offers during the close season for the player. He was again not issued with a squad number and did not play any first team football during the first half of the campaign. In an interview on Soccer AM, Johnson revealed he trained during afternoons, away from the first team group, but \"would probably give up a fair amount of money if I just walked out\". On 2 February 2015, the final day of the January transfer window, it was announced that his contract with Wolves had been terminated by mutual consent.\n\nOn 3 February 2015, following the termination of his contract with Wolves, Johnson signed a deal with Championship side Charlton Athletic to last until the end of the season. He started 14 of Charlton's remaining 16 matches.\n\nOn 12 May 2015, Johnson was released at the end of his contract.\n\nOn 18 August 2015, Johnson joined Indian Super League side FC Pune City for the 2015 tournament.\n\nOn 4 January 2016, Johnson re-signed for Charlton Athletic on an 18-month contract. He was released in May 2017.\n\nJohnson signed for National League club Bromley on a short-term deal in October 2017. He made his debut on 14 October in an FA Cup fourth qualifying round match away to Dover Athletic, playing until the 90th minute and helping his team achieve a goalless draw. Johnson helped Bromley reach the FA Trophy final at Wembley Stadium against Brackley Town, however he conceded an own goal in the 95th minute. Bromley went on to lose on a penalty shoot-out. On 16 May 2019, Bromley announced that Johnson had left the club.\n\nCardiff City\n\nBirmingham City\n\nBromley\n\nIndividual\n\nJohnson was born in Ashford, Surrey. He attended St Michael's Middle School in Colehill, Dorset, and then Queen Elizabeth's School, Wimborne Minster. Together with his brothers, Johnson supported Chelsea; he held a season ticket for ten years. As of 2010, Johnson and his wife Melissa had a daughter named Brooke.\n"}

She had a double bottom and seven watertight compartments and an armoured bow and stern. She was designed to provide a year-round service between Denmark and Greenland. Like the , \"Hans Hedtoft\" had a riveted hull, a feature which was criticised by Knud Lauritzen, a shipowner. Lauritzen claimed that a riveted hull was not as resistant to ice pressure as a welded hull. \"Hans Hedtoft\" had the Code Letters and radio callsign OXKA. The ship was named for a former prime minister of Denmark.\n\nThe ship was armed with three 40 mm anti-aircraft guns, on the orders of the Danish Ministry of Defence (MoD). The armament was not part of the original plans, and the ship was strengthened in three places to take the guns. An ammunition room was built into the bow of the ship. The MoD provided the anti-aircraft guns free of charge. Although fitted during tests, the guns were dismounted and carried aboard \"Hans Hedtoft\" at the time of her sinking. An order had been issued that the guns were to be removed from the ship immediately after she arrived back in Copenhagen. It was claimed that the arming of \"Hans Hedtoft\" resulted in a warship being constructed without the approval of the Folketing.\n\n\"Hans Hedtoft\" sailed from Copenhagen on her maiden voyage on 7 January 1959. Her voyage to Julianehaab, Greenland, was made in record time. \"Hans Hedtoft\" called at Nuuk, Sisimiut and Maniitsoq before returning to Julianehaab.\nOn 29 January, she began her return journey. The ship had 40 crew, 55 passengers and a cargo of frozen fish on board and in addition to that 3,25 tons of archives concerning Greenlandic history. One of her passengers was the Danish parliament (Folketing) member Augo Lynge. The next day, \"Hans Hedtoft\" collided with an iceberg about south of Cape Farewell, the southernmost point of Greenland. A distress call was given at 13:56 (local time) stating that the ship had hit an iceberg at . The call was answered by the USCGC \"Campbell\", the West German trawler \"Johannes Krüss\" of Bremerhaven and another West German trawler. Within an hour, another message was sent stating that the engine room was flooded. At 15:12, it was announced that the ship was sinking. A final message was sent at 17:41 stating the ship was slowly sinking and requesting immediate assistance. Aircraft in Newfoundland were grounded by the weather and unable to assist in the search for \"Hans Hedtoft\". The beginning of an SOS was received by \"Johannes Krüss\" at 17:41 after which communication with \"Hans Hedtoft\" was lost. On 31 January, USCGC \"Campbell\" reported that conditions were the worst seen and there was no sign of \"Hans Hedtoft\" or her passengers and crew. The search was called off on 7 February. The only piece of wreckage ever recovered was a lifebuoy which washed ashore on Iceland and discovered on 7 October 1959, some nine months after the ship sank. The ship sank with parish registers from parishes of Greenland, which were meant to be deposited in archives in Denmark, causing a major loss for Greenlandic genealogy.\n\nAs a result of the sinking, the airfield at Narsarsuaq, Greenland, which had closed in November 1958, was reopened. An appeal fund for the relatives of the victims was opened. Kr40,000 (then £2,000) was raised amongst ten countries in two months. Compensation for the relatives amounted to Kr1,184,936 (then £59,000). Like the RMS \"Titanic\", \"Hans Hedtoft\" was said to be the safest ship afloat, being described as \"unsinkable\" by some.\n\nOn 30 January 2005, Queen Margrethe unveiled a monument at North Atlantic Wharf, Copenhagen, to the 95 people lost on \"Hans Hedtoft\".\n\nThe shipwreck is the theme of the 2014 song \"All Hope Abandon\" by the Greenlandic band Small Time Giants.\n\n"}

A National Historic Landmark, Colonial Michilimackinac is accredited by American Association of Museums.\n\nFort Michilimackinac was an 18th-century French, and later British, fort and trading post in the Great Lakes of North America. Built around 1715, it was located along the southern shore of the strategic Straits of Mackinac connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, at the northern tip of the lower peninsula of the present-day state of Michigan in the United States. The site of the fort in present-day Mackinaw City, Michigan is a National Historic Landmark and is now preserved as an open-air historical museum.\n\nThis site housed a French fort but that was compromised by the British and became their trading post system, stretching from the Mississippi River through the Illinois Country to the St. Lawrence River. The fort served as a supply for traders in the western Great Lakes.\n\nThe French had first established a presence in the Straits of Mackinac in 1671 when Father Jacques Marquette established a Jesuit mission at present-day St. Ignace, Michigan. In 1683, they augmented the mission with Fort de Buade. In 1701, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac moved the French garrison to Fort Detroit and closed the mission. By 1715, however, the French built Fort Michilimackinac to re-establish a presence along the Straits of Mackinac.\n\nThe French relinquished the fort, along with their territory in Canada, to the British in 1761 following their loss in the French and Indian War. Although British continued to operate the fort as a major trading post, the Ojibwe (Chippewa) in the region resented British policies as harsh. On June 2, 1763, as part of the larger movement known as Pontiac's Rebellion, a group of Ojibwe staged a game of bag'gat'tway (lacrosse) outside the fort as a ruse to gain entrance. After gaining entrance to the fort, they killed most of the British inhabitants and held the fort for a year before the British retook it.\n\nThe British eventually deemed the wooden fort on the mainland too vulnerable to attack, and in 1781 they built Fort Mackinac, a limestone fort on nearby Mackinac Island. Fort Michilimackinac was abandoned after the move.\n\nThe fort grounds were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. It is a popular tourist attraction as part of Colonial Michilimackinac State Park in Mackinaw City. The site has numerous reconstructed historical wooden structures and is considered the most extensively excavated early French archaeological site in the United States, with ongoing excavations each summer. There are daily cannon and musket firing demonstrations performed by costumed interpreters. There are also accurate cooking demonstrations in which park visitors can participate.\n\n"}
{"id": "2219841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219841", "title": "Selective catalytic reduction", "text": "Selective catalytic reduction\n\nSelective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a means of converting nitrogen oxides, also referred to as with the aid of a catalyst into diatomic nitrogen (), and water (). A gaseous reductant, typically anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia or urea, is added to a stream of flue or exhaust gas and is adsorbed onto a catalyst. Carbon dioxide, is a reaction product when urea is used as the reductant.\n\nSelective catalytic reduction of using ammonia as the reducing agent was patented in the United States by the Engelhard Corporation in 1957. Development of SCR technology continued in Japan and the US in the early 1960s with research focusing on less expensive and more durable catalyst agents. The first large-scale SCR was installed by the IHI Corporation in 1978.\n\nCommercial selective catalytic reduction systems are typically found on large utility boilers, industrial boilers, and municipal solid waste boilers and have been shown to reduce by 70-95%. More recent applications include diesel engines, such as those found on large ships, diesel locomotives, gas turbines, and even automobiles.\n\nThe use of SCR is now vital in meeting the EURO6 diesel emissions standards for heavy trucks, and also for cars and light commercial vehicles. In many cases, emissions of NOx and PM (Particulate Matter) have been reduced by upwards of 90% when compared with vehicles of the early 1990s; thanks in no small part to SCR technology.\n\nThe reduction reaction takes place as the gases pass through the catalyst chamber. Before entering the catalyst chamber the ammonia, or other reductant (such as urea), is injected and mixed with the gases. The chemical equation for a stoichiometric reaction using either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia for a selective catalytic reduction process is:\n\nWith several secondary reactions:\n\nThe reaction for urea instead of either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia is:\n\nThe ideal reaction has an optimal temperature range between 630 and 720 K, but can operate from 500 to 720 K with longer residence times. The minimum effective temperature depends on the various fuels, gas constituents, and catalyst geometry. Other possible reductants include cyanuric acid and ammonium sulfate.\n\nSCR catalysts are made from various ceramic materials used as a carrier, such as titanium oxide, and active catalytic components are usually either oxides of base metals (such as vanadium, molybdenum and tungsten), zeolites, or various precious metals. Another catalyst based on activated carbon was also developed which is applicable for the removal of NOx at low temperatures. Each catalyst component has advantages and disadvantages.\n\nBase metal catalysts, such as the vanadium and tungsten, lack high thermal durability, but are less expensive and operate very well at the temperature ranges most commonly seen in industrial and utility boiler applications. Thermal durability is particularly important for automotive SCR applications that incorporate the use of a diesel particulate filter with forced regeneration. They also have a high catalysing potential to oxidize into , which can be extremely damaging due to its acidic properties.\n\nZeolite catalysts have the potential to operate at substantially higher temperature than base metal catalysts; they can withstand prolonged operation at temperatures of 900 K and transient conditions of up to 1120 K. Zeolites also have a lower potential for potentially damaging oxidation.\n\nIron- and copper-exchanged zeolite urea SCRs have been developed with approximately equal performance to that of vanadium-urea SCRs if the fraction of the is 20% to 50% of the total .\nThe two most common designs of SCR catalyst geometry used today are honeycomb and plate. The honeycomb form usually is an extruded ceramic applied homogeneously throughout the ceramic carrier or coated on the substrate. Like the various types of catalysts, their configuration also has advantages and disadvantages. Plate-type catalysts have lower pressure drops and are less susceptible to plugging and fouling than the honeycomb types, but plate configurations are much larger and more expensive. Honeycomb configurations are smaller than plate types, but have higher pressure drops and plug much more easily. A third type is corrugated, comprising only about 10% of the market in power plant applications.\n\nSeveral reductants are currently used in SCR applications including anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia or urea. All those three reductants are widely available in large quantities.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia can be stored as a liquid at approximately 10 bar pressure in steel tanks. It is classified as an inhalation hazard, but it can be safely stored and handled if well-developed codes and standards are followed. Its advantage is that it needs no further conversion to operate within an SCR. It is typically favoured by large industrial SCR operators. Aqueous ammonia must be vaporized in order to be used, but it is substantially safer to store and transport than anhydrous ammonia. Urea is the safest to store, but requires conversion to ammonia through thermal decomposition in order to be used as an effective reductant.\n\nSCR systems are sensitive to contamination and plugging resulting from normal operation or abnormal events. Many SCRs are given a finite life due to known amounts of contaminants in the untreated gas. The large majority of catalyst on the market is of porous construction. A clay planting pot is a good example of what SCR catalyst feels like. This porosity is what gives the catalyst the high surface area essential for reduction of NOx. However, the pores are easily plugged by a variety of compounds present in combustion/fuel gas. Some examples of plugging contaminates are: fine particulate, ammonia sulfur compounds, ammonium bisulfate (ABS) and silicon compounds. Many of these contaminants can be removed while the unit is on line, for example by sootblowers. The unit can also be cleaned during a turnaround or by raising the exhaust temperature. Of more concern to SCR performance is poisons, which will destroy the chemistry of the catalyst and render the SCR ineffective at NOx reduction or cause unwanted oxidation of ammonia (forming more NOx). Some of these poisons include: halogens, alkaline metals, arsenic, phosphorus, antimony, chrome, copper.\n\nMost SCRs require tuning to properly perform. Part of tuning involves ensuring a proper distribution of ammonia in the gas stream and uniform gas velocity through the catalyst. Without tuning, SCRs can exhibit inefficient NOx reduction along with excessive ammonia slip due to not utilizing the catalyst surface area effectively. Another facet of tuning involves determining the proper ammonia flow for all process conditions. Ammonia flow is in general controlled based on NOx measurements taken from the gas stream or preexisting performance curves from an engine manufacturer (in the case of gas turbines and reciprocating engines). Typically, all future operating conditions must be known beforehand to properly design and tune an SCR system.\n\nAmmonia slip is an industry term for ammonia passing through the SCR un-reacted. This occurs when ammonia is over-injected into gas stream, temperatures are too low for ammonia to react, or catalyst has degraded (see above).\n\nTemperature is one of the largest limitations of SCR. Gas turbines, cars, and diesel engines all have a period during a start-up where exhaust temperatures are too cool for NOx reduction to occur.\n\nIn power stations, the same basic technology is employed for removal of from the flue gas of boilers used in power generation and industry. In general, the SCR unit is located between the furnace economizer and the air heater, and the ammonia is injected into the catalyst chamber through an ammonia injection grid. As in other SCR applications, the temperature of operation is critical. Ammonia slip is also an issue with SCR technology used in power plants.\n\nOther issues that must be considered in using SCR for control in power plants are the formation of ammonium sulfate and ammonium bisulfate due to the sulfur content of the fuel as well as the undesirable catalyst-caused formation of from the and in the flue gas.\n\nA further operational difficulty in coal-fired boilers is the binding of the catalyst by fly ash from the fuel combustion. This requires the usage of sootblowers, sonic horns, and careful design of the ductwork and catalyst materials to avoid plugging by the fly ash. SCR catalysts have a typical operational lifetime of about 16,000-40,000 hours in coal-fired power plants, depending on the flue gas composition, and up to 80,000 hours in cleaner gas-fired power plants.\n\nDiesel engines manufactured on or after January 1, 2010 are required to meet lowered NOx standards for the US market.\n\nAll of the heavy-duty engine (Class 7-8 trucks) manufacturers except for Navistar International and Caterpillar continuing to manufacture engines after this date have chosen to use SCR. This includes Detroit Diesel (DD13, DD15, and DD16 models), Cummins (ISX, ISL9, and ISB6.7), Paccar, and Volvo/Mack. These engines require the periodic addition of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF, a urea solution) to enable the process. DEF is available in a bottle from most truck stops, and some provide bulk DEF dispensers near diesel fuel pumps. Caterpillar and Navistar had initially chosen to use enhanced exhaust gas recirculation (EEGR) to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, but in July 2012 Navistar announced it would be pursuing SCR technology for its engines, except on the MaxxForce 15 which was to be discontinued. Caterpillar had ultimately decided to exit the on-highway engine business prior to implementation of these requirements.\n\nBMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen have used SCR technology in some of their passenger diesel cars.\n\n\n"}

It was an important battle in the German Peasants' War and the final act of the war in Thuringia: joint troops of Landgrave Philip I of Hesse and Duke George of Saxony defeated the peasants under their spiritual leader Thomas Müntzer near Frankenhausen in the County of Schwarzburg. \nOn April 29, 1525, the struggles in and around Frankenhausen had culminated into an open revolt. Large parts of the citizenry joined the uprising, occupied the town hall and stormed the castle of the Counts of Schwarzburg. In the following days, a rising number of insurgents gathered around the town, and when Müntzer arrived with 300 fighters from Mühlhausen on May 11, several thousand peasants of the surrounding Thuringian and Saxon estates camped in the fields and pastures. Philip of Hesse and his father-in-law George of Saxony had originally targeted Mühlhausen as their strategic objective but, when news arrived that Müntzer left with a troop for Frankenhausen, they changed their march route and directed their Landsknecht troops toward Frankenhausen.\n\nThe princes had great difficulties in recruiting Landsknecht mercenaries. Generally they would have been better equipped than the insurgents, although morale and discipline were always dependent on the size of the war chest. The peasants were less well armed, with a mix of improvised weapons from farming tools and polearms, breastplates and handguns which many would have had by dint of their service in local militia bands (Landwehr). Indeed, on May 14 they successfully repulsed a scouting party and its reinforcements but remained in position on the outskirts of the town having taken the decision not to pursue the Princes' \"forlorn hope\". The main column of Hessian and Brunswick troops were still in the process of arriving after a night's march and needed to rest up. Late that day a decision was taken by the rebels to withdraw into a wagon fort on the hill overlooking the town. It is unclear who initiated a truce to enable some negotiation. This gave the princes time to meet up with George of Saxony's army approaching from the East and to encircle the wagon fort rather than lay siege on the town.\n\nIt is suggested that the truce was broken around midday when it had become clear that Müntzer was not going to be delivered up to the Princes. Starting with an artillery barrage followed by waves of horse and footsoldiers, the princes caught the peasants off guard and they fled in panic into the town, followed and continuously attacked by the mercenaries. Most of the insurgents were slain in what turned out to be a massacre. Casualty figures are unreliable but peasant losses have been estimated at more than 7,000 while the Landsknecht casualties were estimated to be as low as six. Müntzer himself was captured in the town, tortured and finally executed at Mühlhausen on May 27, 1525.\n\nAt Frankenhausen, the battle is depicted, along with many other scenes of that age, on the world's largest oil painting, Werner Tübke's \"Early Bourgeois Revolution in Germany\" (\"Frühbürgerliche Revolution in Deutschland\"), which is 400 feet (120m) long, 45 feet (14m) high, and housed in its own specially built museum. The painting was ordered by the socialist leadership of East Germany, who regarded Müntzer as a revolutionary and thus as one of their forebears; work on it went on between 1975 and 1987. However Tübke did not solely focus on the battle, contrary to the state's wishes, but placed the events at Frankenhausen in a much wider social, political and cultural context prevalent in Reformation Germany at the time.\n\n\n"}

Opened in 1925, it is one of the oldest and best known pizzerias in the United States.\n\nPepe's was founded in 1925 by Frank Pepe (April 15, 1893 – September 6, 1969), an Italian immigrant. Pepe was born in Maiori, Italy, and immigrated to New Haven in 1909 when he was a teenager. The quintessential Wooster Square Italian immigrant took a job at a New Haven factory, but wasn't fond of continuing there. During World War I, Pepe went back to Italy to fight for his native country. Upon returning, he soon landed a job working at a bakery on Wooster Street. Pepe began walking through the Wooster Square market and sold his \"tomato pies\" off of a special headdress. After saving enough money, he was able to buy a wagon from which he sold his pizzas. He was so successful that he was eventually able to take over his employer's business and turn it into the first \"Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana\" on June 16, 1925. Frank Pepe died on September 6, 1969.\n\nPepe's originated the New Haven-style thin-crust apizza (closely related to Neapolitan-style Italian pizza) which he baked in a coal-fired brick pizza oven. Originally, Frank Pepe only made two varieties of pizza: the \"tomato pie\" (tomatoes with grated pecorino romano cheese, garlic, oregano, and olive oil) and the other with the addition of anchovy.\n\nThe piece of land which Pepe's restaurant sat on was owned by the Boccamiello family. They later made Frank Pepe leave so that they could start their own pizzeria at the establishment, which they renamed The Spot. Pepe moved his restaurant to its current location next door to The Spot in 1936. The Pepe family later bought back The Spot from the Boccamiello family in 1981 and it now serves the same menu as the newer restaurant.\n\nIn the alleyway between The Spot and Pepe's, Boccamiello's nephew Bear would open clams and sell them on the half shell to passersby. Pepe's restaurant began serving littleneck clams on the half shell at the bar. It was only a matter of time before he decided to put the clams on the pizza. The white clam pie is just crust, olive oil, oregano, grated cheese, chopped garlic, and fresh littleneck clams. The restaurant will serve the pizza with or without mozzarella cheese, but they try to discourage customers from ordering it with mozzarella because they feel that it makes the pizza too heavy and rich. They are also adamant on using freshly shucked clams as opposed to canned clams; if fresh clams are not available then they will not serve the white clam pie. Three men are employed by Pepe's just for shucking the clams on location. Since its invention, the white clam pie has become the signature pizza of pizzerias in New Haven.\n\nIn March, 2015 Pepe's released their plans to expand into the Boston market. On December 16, 2015 they opened their Chestnut Hill location.\n\nOn April 17, 2017, Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana opened their 9th location in Waterbury, CT.\n\nOn June 10, 2019, the newest Pepe's opened at the Burlington Mall in Burlington, MA, in the location that formerly housed a Pizzeria Uno.\n\nAll of Pepe's locations feature the same menu. Since 1925, Pepe's has exclusively served Foxon Park bottled sodas from East Haven, Connecticut. The restaurant offers soda, beer, wine, and several varieties of pizzas and toppings.\n\nAll Pepe's ovens are coal-fired and built in exactly the same manner from brick, based on the original. They measure by and cook pizzas in approximately 8 to 10 minutes. The oven cooks at .\n\nPepe's has expanded outside of New Haven as a small family owned chain. Nine relatives are co-owners of the chain, including grandsons Gary Bimonte and Francis Rosselli. All locations feature the same green and white design of their building and fixtures, serve on the square pizza pans and use the same suppliers for their ingredients.\n\n\nAnother Wooster Street pizza restaurant, Sally's Apizza, was founded by Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio in 1938. Sally's and Pepe's have a long friendly rivalry and pizza fans are divided over which serves the better pizza. Frank Sinatra, for example, was a fan of Sally's, while President Ronald Reagan preferred Pepe's.\n\nPepe's is a busy establishment, and New Havenites will cheerfully wait in line outside the restaurant for hours in all kinds of weather. Having to wait to be seated is almost as much of a New Haven tradition as the pizza itself. Pepe's is also a major tourist attraction in New Haven.\n\nRobert De Niro, Henry Winkler, Kelly Clarkson, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, Ernest Borgnine, John Turturro, Bill Clinton, Kevin James, Vince Vaughn & Damian Lewis have all visited the New Haven location.\n\n\n"}

A court which has made a child-custody determination consistent with UCCJEA has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the determination until either (1) that court determines that neither the child, the child's parents, nor any person acting as a parent has a significant connection with the State that made the original order and that substantial evidence is no longer available in the State concerning the child's care, protection, training, and personal relationships, \"or\" (2) that court or a court of another State determines that the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not reside in the State that initially made the child custody order.\n\nThe UCCJEA replaced a previous Uniform Act, the \"Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act\", primarily because the old act was inconsistent with the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act when determining proper jurisdiction for initial custody determinations and because of contradictory interpretations of the PKPA. The UCCJEA corrects these problems. The UCCJEA also added uniform procedures to register and enforce child-custody orders across state lines.\n\nTo determine which state has proper jurisdiction to make an \"initial determination\" of child custody, the UCCJEA proceeds in the following order of priority:\n\nA state having jurisdiction under #1 or #2 above may decline to exercise its jurisdiction, and transfer it to another state if it is more convenient for the parties, or if one of the parties has engaged in misconduct necessitating a change.\n\n\"Home state\" is defined as the \"state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child-custody proceeding. In the case of a child less than six months of age, the term means the state in which the child lived from birth with any of the persons mentioned. A period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period.\"\n\nFor example, young Chris has lived in Iowa with his mother and father for the last three years. If the mother moves to Minnesota, but Chris remains in Iowa, then Minnesota will not have jurisdiction to determine custody over Chris. Iowa is the only state that can determine custody at this point.\n\nOnce a state court has made a custody determination, that state keeps jurisdiction over all matters concerning that child, unless:\n\nFor an example of #1, the parents divorce in Texas, and mother and children move to Mississippi. The father continues to live in Texas and the children maintain a significant connection to Texas by visiting Texas often and spending their summers there. Three years later father files suit in Texas to modify custody. The mother attempts to transfer jurisdiction to Mississippi. The UCCJEA, which was designed to prevent forum shopping, prevents her attempt by providing protection to an issuing court's jurisdiction that made an initial child custody determination unless: ...\"or... the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state\".\n\nFor an example of #2, parents divorce in Texas, mother and children move to Mississippi, Father moves to California. Because the children and both parents no longer live in Texas, the courts of Texas will have lost their exclusive, continuing jurisdiction to modify their own custody orders. For most practical purposes, that means that jurisdiction to modify those orders will most likely not be in Texas, but, rather, in the state where the children and at least one parent have taken up residence (here, Mississippi).\n\nOnce a custody determination has been made, a court of another state does not have authority to modify the determination, unless the state with jurisdiction determines that it does not have jurisdiction as noted above, or any state court determines that the child, parents, and any acting parents do not reside in the state which has jurisdiction.\n\nTo continue with the example of an initial custody determination above, let us say that Chris' father gets custody of Chris in the Iowa courts, and the mom moves to Arkansas. If Chris spends the summer with his mom in Arkansas, his mom cannot go to the Arkansas courts and attempt to modify custody - Iowa has continuing jurisdiction.\n\nA state which does not otherwise have jurisdiction may enter a temporary emergency order, if the child is in danger and needs immediate protection. After issuing such order, the state court should determine if there is an existing custody order from another state in effect. If there is an existing order, the emergency court must allow a reasonable time period for the parties to return to the state having jurisdiction, and argue the issues to the court with jurisdiction. \n\nIf there is no previous child custody order in existence, the emergency court's order will remain in effect until a determination is made in a court having \"home state\" jurisdiction over the child. If no determination is made, and the emergency court's state becomes the home state of the child, the emergency order becomes a final determination of custody...\n\n"}

{"id": "2219887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219887", "title": "Negative refraction", "text": "Negative refraction\n\nNegative refraction is the name for an electromagnetic phenomenon where light rays are refracted at an interface in the reverse sense to that normally expected. Such an effect can be obtained using a metamaterial which has been designed to achieve a negative value for both (electric) permittivity ε and (magnetic) permeability μ, as in such cases the material can be assigned a negative refractive index. Such materials are sometimes called \"double negative\" materials.\n\nNegative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive phase velocity (i.e. a positive refractive index), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (a negative refractive index).\n\nNegative phase velocity (NPV) is a property of light propagation in a medium. There are different definitions of NPV, the most common being Veselago's original proposal of opposition of wavevector and (Abraham) Poynting vector, i.e. E×H; other common choices are opposition of wavevector to group velocity, or to energy velocity. The use of \"phase velocity\" in the naming convention, as opposed to the perhaps more appropriate \"wave vector\", follows since phase velocity has the same sign as the wavevector.\n\nA typical criterion used to determine Veselago NPV is that the dot product of the Poynting vector and wavevector is negative (i.e. that formula_1); however this definition is not covariant. Whilst this restriction is rarely of practical significance, the criterion has nevertheless been generalized into a covariant form. For plane waves propagating in a Veselago NPV medium, the electric field, magnetic field and wave vector follow a left-hand rule, rather than the usual right-hand rule. This gives rise to the name \"left-handed (meta)materials\". However, the terms left-handed and right-handed can also arise in the study of chiral media, so this terminology is best avoided.\n\nWe can choose to avoid directly considering the Poynting vector and wavevector or a propagating light field, and consider instead the response of the materials directly. Assuming an achiral material, we consider what values of permittivity ε and permeability µ result in negative phase velocity (NPV). Since both ε and µ are in general complex, their imaginary parts do not have to be negative for a passive (i.e. lossy) material to display negative refraction. The most general Veselago criterion applying to ε and µ is that of Depine and Lakhtakia, although other less general forms exist. The Depine-Lakhtakia criterion for negative phase velocity is\n\nwhere formula_3 are the real valued parts of ε and µ, respectively. However, negative refraction (negative refractive index) and negative phase velocity can be distinct from each other, even in passive materials, but also in active materials.\n\nTypically, the refractive index formula_4 is determined using \n\nwhere by convention the positive square root is chosen for formula_4. However, in NPV materials, we reverse that convention and pick the negative sign to mimic the fact that the wavevector (and hence phase velocity) are likewise reversed. Strictly speaking, the refractive index is a derived quantity telling us how the wavevector is related to the optical frequency and propagation direction of the light, thus the sign of formula_4 must be chosen to match the physical situation.\n\nIn case of chiral materials, the refractive index also depends on the chirality parameter formula_8, resulting in distinct values for left and right circularly polarized waves, given by\n\nIt can be seen that a negative index will occur for one polarization if formula_8 > formula_11. In this case, it is not necessary that either or both formula_12 and formula_13 be negative to achieve a negative index of refraction. A negative refractive index due to chirality was predicted by Pendry and Tretyakov \"et al.\", and first observed simultaneously and independently by Plum \"et al.\" and Zhang \"et al.\" in 2009.\n\nThe principal symptom of negative refraction is just that – light rays are \nrefracted on the \"same\" side of the normal on entering the material, as indicated in the diagram, and by a suitably general form of Snell's law.\n\n\n"}

The song was written and produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who were also the producers of Minogue's first four studio albums. The song was intended to be released as the fifth single from \"Kylie\", but due to the success and longevity of Kylie's massive selling duet with Jason Donovan, \"Especially for You\", over Christmas 1988 and the following new year, it was only released in a handful of countries. In the United States, \"It's No Secret\" was released as Kylie's third single where it reached the top 40 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nOriginally scheduled to be released worldwide, \"It's No Secret\" was cancelled in most territories in favour of \"Hand on Your Heart\", a brand new track, which was released in April 1989 and was the first to be released from her second album \"Enjoy Yourself\". Eventually, the song was only released in USA, New Zealand, Canada and Japan. A screenshot from the video of \"It's No Secret\" was used as the cover of the \"Hand on Your Heart\" CD and cassette, while the track itself was also used as the B-side to its follow-up, \"Wouldn't Change a Thing\" which was released in July 1989.\n\nDue to its limited release and therefore, no promotion, the song was not a huge commercial success, but it did well enough to promote its parent album \"Kylie\" from which it was released. \"It's No Secret\" debuted at number 47 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, where it only peaked for a sole week. In February 1989, the song climbed to number 37 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, managing to peak inside the Top 40. In total, the song spent a total of thirteen weeks in the Hot 100, making the song one of Kylie's longest-running singles on the chart itself.\n\nAn accompanying music video was shot for the single in Minogue's native country Australia. It features a vague storyline with Minogue having an argument with her boyfriend because he keeps taking money from her and she eventually finds out he's also interested in another girl. She walks around reflecting on her unhappy relationship until she eventually finishes with him. The final scene is of Minogue walking blissfully down a train track, a single woman once again. The video to \"It's No Secret\" opens Minogue's second official video collection, \"Kylie: The Videos 2\", which was released in the UK and Australia in November 1989 and was a big seller.\n\nMinogue promoted \"It's No Secret\", performing it on \"Live at the Hippodrome\", a UK television show, and in a rare all-live with band US appearance on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" and \"Club MTV\".\n\n\"It's No Secret\" debuted at #47 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, where it peaked for one week. To date, this is Minogue's worst performing single in New Zealand. In December 1988, the song debuted at #90 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, managing to peak at #37 in February 1989. In total, the song spent a total of thirteen weeks in the Hot 100, making the song one of Minogue's longest-spanning single on the chart itself.\n\nThe clip was shot in Port Douglas, Queensland. It starts with Kylie behind the counter of a diner, her boyfriend asking for money, she later sees him with another girl and walks out.

He is CEO of International Airlines Group, and has been CEO of Aer Lingus and British Airways.\n\nWalsh was born in Dublin, Ireland. He attended his local secondary school Ardscoil Rís. At age 17 he became a pilot at Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, joining as a cadet in 1979. He acquired a Master's degree in management and business administration from Trinity College, Dublin during his pilot years, while advancing to become a Boeing 737 captain.\n\nHe joined company management in various positions including chief executive of then company subsidiary, Futura from 1998 to 2000. He returned to Aer Lingus at that time as Chief Operating Officer (COO).\n\nIn October 2001, Walsh was elevated from COO to CEO of Aer Lingus, succeeding Michael Foley who had resigned following a harassment complaint. The carrier was in financial difficulty. Walsh eliminated 2,000 staff positions and reconfigured Aer Lingus as a low-cost airline. He also withdrew various services like short-haul Business Class and restricted the airline's frequent-flyer programme, TAB.\n\nThe company operating profits rebounded, but the cost of the write-offs and redundancies meant that net profitability was not as quick to recover. Not all of Walsh's reforms were successful, such as the outsourcing of aircraft cleaning. The contracting had not been agreed with Aer Lingus unions which led to large payments to the private contractor while Aer Lingus employees did the cleaning work. A three-day lock-out occurred in 2002 during the peak of the cutbacks.\n\nThe management team suggested to the principal shareholder, the Irish Government, a float of Aer Lingus on the stock market. Stock floats are often rewarding to top management and this was opposed by the unions who feared a privatised Aer Lingus would impose even tougher working conditions. The Government eventually turned down the float and Walsh resigned from the company in January 2005.\n\nThe Taoiseach Bertie Ahern subsequently described Walsh's offer of an MBO as \"\"a time when management wanted to steal the assets for themselves through a management buy out, shafting staff interests\"\".\n\nDermot Mannion, formerly of Emirates, succeeded Walsh as Aer Lingus chief executive officer in August 2005.\n\nBefore joining British Airways, he briefly worked at the top of Virgin Atlantic but left after a short while due to a falling out with his boss. After he left, a position opened up at British Airways where the board was seeking a successor to chief executive officer Rod Eddington who had announced plans to return to his native Australia at the end of his contract. Walsh was hired in May 2005, with a six-month shadowing period to get to know the business before the departure of Eddington on October 2005.\n\nWillie Walsh became CEO of British Airways in October 2005 and faced a number of major challenges, including a global downturn, increased competition (from low-cost carriers in Europe and premium carriers worldwide), increasing oil prices and taxes. He presided over a period of extensive change for the company. He reduced the number of managers, increased productivity of engineers, baggage handlers and flight crew, and saw through a dispute with the airline's cabin crew.\n\nThe major challenges for the airline industry were exacerbated by various natural events such as snow, fog and volcanic ash. He described the closure of European airspace in April 2010 over worries about the ash plume from an erupting Icelandic volcano as a \"gross over-reaction to a very minor risk\".\n\nWalsh oversaw the merger of British Airways and Iberia forming a new holding company International Airlines Group (IAG) in January 2011. He also created a Joint Business Agreement with Iberia and American Airlines, meaning the three airlines now market and sell each other's seats and share revenue on trans-Atlantic routes.\n\nOn 24 January 2011, Willie Walsh became chief executive of IAG, which is the parent company of BA and Iberia. Both airlines are members of the Oneworld alliance. It was announced on 9 January 2020 that he would be stepping down as CEO in March 2020, however Walsh announced on 16 March that he intended to delay his retirement in order to help the airline trade through the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nIn March 2014, \"Aviation Week & Space Technology\" magazine named Walsh as its 2014 Laureate for Commercial Aviation.\n\n"}

It has been the training ground of the London Broncos rugby league club since 2014; the club's under-19 team also play their fixtures there. Before being demolished the stadium was recorded as having a final capacity of 6,023. The stadium was famous for its slope from the North to South end. It was also used for Arsenal reserve games until 2012.\n\nBarnet played their final game at the stadium on 20 April 2013 with a 1-0 win over Wycombe Wanderers, with Jake Hyde scoring the winner in the 81st minute, and Graham Stack saving a 94th-minute penalty to secure the victory in front of a sell-out crowd of 6,001. Barnet moved out of the ground and started their 2013-14 season campaign at The Hive Stadium in Edgware. Demolition of Underhill began in January 2018.\n\nThe ground was opened in September 1907 with a match against Crystal Palace which the home side won 1–0. At the time, there were a number of amateur clubs playing in Barnet. When opened, the ground was home to Barnet Alston. Alston merged with Avenue FC (who were known as Barnet FC) in 1912 to become Barnet & Alston FC. After the First World War, the club reverted to the name Barnet FC, which continues today.\n\nTo celebrate the 100th year of football at the stadium, the two sides met again in the 2007-08 Pre-Season. Palace won this match 3–2.\n\nFrom the 2013–14 season Barnet will play their home games at The Hive Stadium.\n\nIn 2014, the Super League rugby league team, London Broncos, will be training at Underhill and their gym and offices will be based there. Their Under-19s side also played matches at the stadium.\n\nEdgware Town played their opening games of the 2014–15 Spartan South Midlands League season at Underhill, while their Silver Jubilee Park ground was refurbished.\n\nIn June 2015 the site was sold to the Education Funding Agency. Demolition work began in January 2018 to facilitate the building the new Ark Pioneer Academy, which is scheduled to open in September 2019.\n\nBarnet opened the 1,016 seater South Stand in 2008 to replace the temporary structure which had stood in its place for over ten years. The stand was first used for the FA Cup victory over Swindon Town in January 2008, just a matter of weeks after work had started.\n\nThe Bees have also erected a temporary covered structure in the North East corner of the ground with seated capacity of 240. This was built so away supporters could have the choice between sitting or standing as the stand is adjacent to the away terraced section.\n\nThese improvements finally brought Underhill to Football League standards and the capacity was increased to 5,568.\n\nThe club have announced that work is underway in order to erect four new corner floodlights, which will be 25 metres high and have a 500 Lux value as opposed to the current 350. The eight old pylons dating from 1962 have been removed. Work was completed prior to the opening pre-season game of the 2010-2011 season against Arsenal and the stadium capacity was again increased to 6,023 as a result.\n\nUnderhill had seven stands. On the bottom end of the ground was the South Stand which was opened recently. The East Terrace was split into three sections, with the home fans allocated the two southernmost parts and the remaining section allocated to away supporters. Adjacent to the East Terrace stood the North East Family Stand with covered seating for away supporters. The tiny North Terrace backed onto Westcombe Drive, where residents could watch the action. The Main Stand was flanked by two smaller stands, the North West Terrace and Family Stand.\n\nAfter a matchday incident on the East Terrace, the club acted to increase the distance between home and away supporters. Away fans have been segregated further towards the north of the terrace. When away support is expected to number over 500, the whole of the North-East section is opened, and the Central section is closed to enforce the new segregation arrangements. The situation further highlights the inadequacy of Underhill as a Football League stadium, even though it now meets league criteria, and the club continues to search for a new home.\n\nIn the South West Corner of the ground stands the Durham Suite, named after Bees midfielder Kevin Durham who died in 1991. Although not part of the ground, the Pavilion behind the South Stand is owned by the club and acts as the social club for many fans. Away fans are not allowed into the Pavilion.\n\nThe record attendance at Underhill was 11,026 against Wycombe Wanderers on 23 February 1952 for an Amateur cup tie.\n\n"}

While most died of the disease, forensic evidence suggests that some may have been murdered, perhaps due to fear of contagion, as the pandemic spanned several continents and many years.\n\nThe site is located in East Whiteland Township, Pennsylvania northeast of the intersection of King Road and Sugartown Road, where a Pennsylvania state historical marker has been placed.\n\nImmigrants generally and Irish Catholics specifically were often viewed by the owners and managers of railroad and coal mining companies as expendable components, and by Anglo-Germanic Americans as unwholesome and even dangerous. \n\nPhilip Duffy's blacksmith buried the first three workers to perish in individual graves, but when it became clear that all would die he buried the rest of the dead in a shallow ditch along the railroad’s right of way without ceremony or funeral. No death certificates were ever filed for these individuals. Asiatic Cholera usually causes 40-60% casualties within a single population. In this case, all of the workers are believed to have died, leading to the theory that some may have been killed.\n\nOfficial record of the deaths at Duffy’s Cut remained locked in the vaults of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) until Joseph Tripican, a secretary to a former PRR president, removed them after the company’s bankruptcy in 1970. In the 1990s, one of Tripican’s grandsons, Reverend Dr. Frank Watson discovered the papers in a file and began to research the history with his brother Dr. William Watson, Professor of History, and adjunct professors Earl Schandelmeier and John Ahtes of Immaculata University.\n\nOn June 18, 2004, a Pennsylvania state historical marker was dedicated near the site. The text of the marker reads, \"Nearby is the mass grave of fifty-seven Irish immigrant workers who died in August, 1832, of cholera. They had recently arrived in the United States and were employed by a construction contractor, named Duffy, for the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad. Prejudice against Irish Catholics contributed to the denial of care to the workers. Their illness and death typified the hazards faced by many 19th century immigrant industrial workers.\"\n\nIn August 2004, the site began undergoing archaeological excavation by a research team headed by Dr. William Watson from Immaculata University, Rev. Dr. Frank Watson, Earl Schandelmeier, and John Ahtes. The Duffy's Cut Project team consisted of four primary members, William Watson, Frank Watson, John Ahtes (who died in 2010) and Earl Schandelmeier at Immaculata University. On March 20, 2009, the first human bones were unearthed, consisting of two skulls, six teeth and eighty other bones. The researchers announced their discovery on March 24, 2009. Bone expert Janet Monge was included in the analysis of skeletal remains.\n\nIn August 2009, \"Finding Dulcinea\" reported that the two earliest skulls found both show evidence of blunt-force trauma inflicted peri-mortem, suggesting the possibility that they were murdered. More recent research of the site suggests that a mass murder may have taken place against the Irish workers by local vigilantes fearful that cholera would spread. Analysis of the bones has indicated the possibility that some of the men were killed by projectiles.\nOn March 9, 2012, the remains of five men and one woman from those who died at Duffy's Cut Shanty Town were laid to rest in a church burial at West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The men and woman were unearthed by researchers from Immaculata University at the location of the Shanty Town near an Amtrak railroad line in Pennsylvania. A sixth body was recovered and identified as John Ruddy from Inishowen, County Donegal; his remains were returned to Ireland for reburial there. in 2013 The remains of Catherine Burns of County Tyrone who died in Duffy's Cut in 1832 were reburied in Ireland in 2015 Excavation of the deep burial site was halted when Amtrak, which owns the land, would not issue permits for additional digging because of the site's proximity to the railroad tracks.\n\nTelevision\n\nPrint\n\nMusic\n"}

The members of the NWT Liberal Party joined the Alberta Liberal Party or the Saskatchewan Liberal Party. With almost no voting population in the remaining parts of the Northwest Territories, its political parties disbanded when the Government of Canada returned to its former policy of appointing members of the Territories' legislative assembly The assembly went back to the consensus model of government.\n\nThe consensus model of government that had been used prior to the election of 1898 had its influences in the party system: Conservative leader and Government Leader Frederick W. A. G. Haultain appointed two Liberals to his cabinet and one Conservative, even though they formed the opposition, from 1898 to 1905. This led Conservatives to accuse the government of being a \"grit hive\", after the election of 1902. To appease party supporters, Haultain appointed one Liberal and two Conservatives to the cabinet.\n\nThe Calgary Herald attacked the Territorial Liberals in October 1902, after they held a convention in which they failed to adopt policies towards the creation of a provincial government. This set off a bitter editorial war against the Liberal and Conservative media.\n\nRobert Brett was the Leader of the party from the beginning until, he made a surprise move to drop out of the race just days before the election of 1902.\nDonald H.

It was cancelled in 2002 after two seasons.\n\nThe series focuses on the search for explanations of, and evidence for, seemingly miraculous phenomena. This search is carried out by the protagonist Declan Dunn (Adrian Pasdar). Declan is a professor of anthropology at the Northern University of Oregon and is often compared with Indiana Jones due to his energetic enthusiasm for solving a mystery. His passion for miraculous events has its roots in a self-experienced mischance of being caught in an avalanche and getting out alive. He considers this to be miraculous and attributes it as the turning point in his life. In several episodes he makes references to this event and the impact it had on his life.\n\nAlways ready to help out with the research, though sometimes they appear slightly reluctant, are Declan's close friends Dr. Peggy Fowler (Rae Dawn Chong), a psychiatrist at a nearby hospital, and Miranda Feigelsteen (Alisen Down), a physics graduate student and Declan's research assistant. Peggy is the most levelheaded of the three and is generally the one presenting the mundane alternatives to Declan's theories. Her so-called \"rational explanations\" often provide no explanation whatsoever, e.g. \"It was just a freak occurrence\".\n\nOften being assigned to carry out tests of various substances, or operating a range of instruments, is Miranda. She is the second skeptic besides Peggy, with a somber and introvert personality, sometimes with moments of joking banter or sarcastic comments. In the episodes \"The Ties That Bind\" (1.08) and \"Free Spirit\" (2.14) another, more open side of her is shown before her social peers, if only temporarily. Being the quiet personality, Miranda is sometimes somewhat of a mystery even to her best friends.\n\nIn many cases the episodes conclude with a rational explanation being seemingly validated, then disproven at the last minute; thus leaving the question of paranormal activity open once more.\n\n\n\"Mysterious Ways\" was created by Peter O'Fallon, who wanted a science-fiction drama that was family-friendly and allowed him to explore humanistic themes. U2's song of the same name inspired the series' title.\n\nThe show first eight episodes aired in the United States on NBC starting July 2000. The show returned in January 2001 and later on July of the same year, before being pulled in August due to poor ratings. Meanwhile, PAX TV (a channel NBC had a 32% interest in) aired the show since August 2000 through the summer months. PAX would become the show's home for the rest of its run, until September 2002. For O'Fallon it was a good move, since it allowed them total creative freedom.\n\nThe series had seen success internationally, even after its cancellation. It currently airs in syndication on VisionTV in Canada.\n\nDespite many fans pushing for it, as of August 2019 the series has not been released on DVD.\n\n"}

It is approximately on the site of the original, and for many years only, Bridge of Dublin, dating back to the 11th century.\n\nThe site of the bridge is understood to be close to the ancient \"Ford of the Hurdles\", which was the original crossing point on the Liffey and gives its name (in Irish) to the city of Dublin ().\n\nAt the turn of the first millennium (c. 1014), the first recorded Dublin Liffey bridge was built at this point. Possibly known as the \"Bridge of Dubhghall\", this basic wooden structure was maintained and rebuilt over several centuries (from early Medieval to Viking to Norman times).\n\nThese rebuilds included a Norman bridge (sanctioned by King John) in the early 13th century. This collapsed however in the late 14th century and in 1428, the Dominicans of Ostmantown Friary built the first masonry bridge in Dublin on the same spot. Known as \"Dublin Bridge\", \"Old Bridge\", or simply \"The Bridge\", this four arch structure had towers at either end, and shops, housing, an inn and a chapel were built on its supports. In 1312 Geoffrey de Morton, Mayor of Dublin 1302–3, was reprimanded for building a house without permission on the bridge. It was he who began building the towers, which were completed by his son-in-law John de Grauntsete, who later built St. Mary's Chapel on the Bridge.\n\nFor much of its 390-year life span, \"The Bridge\" carried all pedestrian, livestock and horse-drawn traffic across the river, and (as late as 1762) its tolls and chapel were still in use.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Dublin Bridge was replaced by a three-span, elliptical arch stone bridge. Designed by George Knowles (who also designed O'Donovan Rossa Bridge and Lucan Bridge), the bridge was opened in 1818 as \"Whitworth Bridge\", being named for Charles Whitworth, 1st Earl Whitworth, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\n\nAs with many other Dublin bridges (particularly those named for British peers), the bridge was renamed following the establishment of the Irish Free State as \"Dublin Bridge\" in the 1920s.\n\nIn line with another, later, Dublin tradition of naming bridges for temperance campaigners, the bridge was renamed again in 1938 for Father Theobald Mathew (\"the Apostle of Temperance\") who was born at Thomastown near Golden, County Tipperary.\n"}

Pepe's restaurant served littleneck clams on the half shell at the bar, which he later added to the pizza. The white clam pie is crust, olive oil, oregano, grated cheese, chopped garlic, and fresh littleneck clams.\n\nWhat makes New Haven style pizza distinct is its thin, oblong crust, characteristic charring, chewy texture, and limited use of melting cheeses.

This form of Welsh developed from Old Welsh.\n\nMiddle Welsh is the language of nearly all surviving early manuscripts of the \"Mabinogion\", although the tales themselves are certainly much older. It is also the language of most of the manuscripts of Welsh law. Middle Welsh is reasonably intelligible, albeit with some work, to a modern-day Welsh speaker.\n\nThe phonology of Middle Welsh is quite similar to that of modern Welsh, with only a few differences. The letter \"u\", which today represents in North Western Welsh dialects and in South Welsh and North East Welsh dialects, represented the close central rounded vowel in Middle Welsh. The diphthong \"aw\" is found in unstressed final syllables in Middle Welsh, while in Modern Welsh it has become \"o\" (e.g. Middle Welsh = Modern Welsh \"horseman\"). Similarly, the Middle Welsh diphthongs \"ei\" and \"eu\" have become \"ai\" and \"au\" in final syllables, e. g. Middle Welsh = modern \"seven\", Middle Welsh = modern \"sun\".\n\nThe orthography of Middle Welsh was not standardised, and there is great variation between manuscripts in how certain sounds are spelled. Some generalisations of differences between Middle Welsh spelling and Modern Welsh spelling can be made. For example, the possessive adjectives \"his, her\", \"their\" and the preposition \"to\" are very commonly spelled in Middle Welsh, and are thus spelt the same as the definite article and the indirect relative particle . A phrase such as is therefore ambiguous in Middle Welsh between the meaning \"the cat\" (spelt the same in Modern Welsh), the meaning \"his cat\" (modern ), and the meaning \"to a cat\" (modern ). The voiced stop consonants are represented by the letters \"t c\" at the end of a word, e.g. \"protection\" (modern ), \"running\" (modern ). The sound is very often spelled \"k\" before the vowels \"e i y\" (in Modern Welsh, it is always spelt \"c\", e.g. Middle Welsh = modern \"third cousin\"). The sound is usually spelt \"u\" or \"v\" (these are interchangeable as in Latin MSS), except at the end of a word, where it is spelt \"f\" (in Modern Welsh, it is always spelt \"f\", e.g. Middle Welsh = modern \"apple tree\"). The sound is usually spelt \"d\" (in Modern Welsh, it is spelt \"dd\", e.g. Middle Welsh = modern \"day\"). The sound is spelt \"r\" and is thus not distinguished from (in Modern Welsh, they are distinguished as \"rh\" and \"r\" respectively, e.g. Middle Welsh \"running\" vs. modern ).\n\nMiddle Welsh is closer to the other medieval Celtic languages, e.g. Old Irish, in its morphology. For example, the endings \"-wŷs, -ws, -es\" and \"-as\" are used for 3rd person singular of the past tense in Middle Welsh as well as the form \"-odd\". In the same person and tense exists the form \"kigleu\" from the verb \"clywed\" 'to hear (etc.)', which is very antiquated and corresponds to the Old Irish \"cúala\" from the verb \"ro-cluinethar\" 'he/she heard'.\n\nMiddle Welsh also has more separate plural forms of adjectives that do not appear in modern Welsh, e.g. \"cochion\" 'red; \"rouges\"'.\n\nThe plural termination \"-awr\" for nouns is very common in Middle Welsh, but has been replaced by \"-au\".\n\nAs in modern written Welsh, the VSO word order (\"Gwelodd y brenin gastell\": \"Saw the king a castle\") is not used exclusively in Middle Welsh, but irregular and mixed orders are also used: \"Y brenin a welodd gastell\": (\"[It was] the king that saw a castle\"). The suggestion is that the mixed order places emphasis on the subject, and is often used in Welsh today to emphasise something. The difference between the two is that a negative particle (\"ni\"/\"na\") precedes the subject in the mixed order (thus \"Ni brenin a welodd gastell\" would mean \"It was not the king that saw the castle\", but precedes the verb in the irregular order (thus \"Brenin ni welodd gastell\" = \"The king did not see a castle\").\n\n\n"}

In this approximation, terms in a Hamiltonian which oscillate rapidly are neglected. This is a valid approximation when the applied electromagnetic radiation is near resonance with an atomic transition, and the intensity is low. Explicitly, terms in the Hamiltonians which oscillate with frequencies formula_1 are neglected, while terms which oscillate with frequencies formula_2 are kept, where formula_3 is the light frequency and formula_4 is a transition frequency.\n\nThe name of the approximation stems from the form of the Hamiltonian in the interaction picture, as shown below. By switching to this picture the evolution of an atom due to the corresponding atomic Hamiltonian is absorbed into the system ket, leaving only the evolution due to the interaction of the atom with the light field to consider. It is in this picture that the rapidly oscillating terms mentioned previously can be neglected. Since in some sense the interaction picture can be thought of as rotating with the system ket only that part of the electromagnetic wave that approximately co-rotates is kept; the counter-rotating component is discarded.\n\nFor simplicity consider a two-level atomic system with ground and excited states formula_5 and formula_6, respectively (using the Dirac bracket notation). Let the energy difference between the states be formula_7 so that formula_8 is the transition frequency of the system. Then the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the atom can be written as\n\nSuppose the atom experiences an external classical electric field of frequency formula_10, given by\nformula_11,\ne.g. a plane wave propagating in space. Then under the dipole approximation the interaction Hamiltonian between the atom and the electric field can be expressed as\n\nwhere formula_13 is the dipole moment operator of the atom. The total Hamiltonian for the atom-light system is therefore formula_14 The atom does not have a dipole moment when it is in an energy eigenstate, so formula_15 This means that defining formula_16 allows the dipole operator to be written as\n\nwhere formula_20 is the Rabi frequency and formula_21 is the counter-rotating frequency. To see why the formula_22 terms are called `counter-rotating' consider a unitary transformation to the interaction or Dirac picture where the transformed Hamiltonian formula_23 is given by\n\nwhere formula_25 is the detuning between the light field and the atom.\n\nThis is the point at which the rotating wave approximation is made. The dipole approximation has been assumed, and for this to remain valid the electric field must be near resonance with the atomic transition. This means that formula_26 and the complex exponentials multiplying formula_22 and formula_28 can be considered to be rapidly oscillating. Hence on any appreciable time scale, the oscillations will quickly average to 0. The rotating wave approximation is thus the claim that these terms may be neglected and thus the Hamiltonian can be written in the interaction picture as\n\nFinally, transforming back into the Schrödinger picture, the Hamiltonian is given by\n\nAnother criterion for rotating wave approximation is the weak coupling condition, that is, the Rabi frequency should be much less than the transition frequency.\n\nAt this point the rotating wave approximation is complete. A common first step beyond this is to remove the remaining time dependence in the Hamiltonian via another unitary transformation.\n\nGiven the above definitions the interaction Hamiltonian is\n\nas stated. The next step is to find the Hamiltonian in the interaction picture, formula_23. The required unitary transformation is\n\nwhere the last step can be seen to follow e.g. from a Taylor series expansion with the fact that formula_34, and due to the orthogonality of the states formula_5 and formula_6 we have\n\nNow we apply the RWA by eliminating the counter-rotating terms as explained in the previous section, and finally transform the approximate Hamiltonian formula_38 back to the Schrödinger picture:\n\nThe atomic Hamiltonian was unaffected by the approximation, so the total Hamiltonian in the Schrödinger picture under the rotating wave approximation is\n"}

It is considered an early example of \"true crime\" fiction, and contains Hugo's early thoughts on societal injustice which thirty years later he would flesh out in his novel \"Les Misérables\". Charles Carlier, merchant, and editor of the \"Revue de Paris\" considered the work to be of such great educational value that he arranged for copies to be sent to all the deputies in France.\n\nClaude Gueux is a poor, hungry inhabitant of Troyes, who has received no education or help from society whatsoever. One day, missing of everything, he steals enough for three days of firewood and bread to feed his mistress and child. But he is caught, condemned to five years and sent to the Clairvaux Prison, an old abbey turned into a high-security detention center. There, the prisoners work as tailors in dirty workshops by day, and sleep in musty cells by night. Before going to sleep, they are given small portions of food to be able to survive through the following day. But Claude Gueux is a big eater, and the tiny quantities of food he is given are not large enough for him. So one of his cellmates, a young and shy criminal named Albin, spontaneously offers to share his food with him. That is the starting point of a long-lasting friendship.\n\nHowever, the prison is ruled by an avid, presumptuous and simply evil man, referred to as the \"Director\". He is jealous of Claude's innate ability to inspire friendship and obedience from all other prisoners, although he has many times used him to keep the prison under control. Seeing the friendship between Albin and Claude, he figures out the best way to irritate and hurt Claude would be to separate them forever, and he does just that. When Claude asks the Director why he has done this, the Director replies 'because I felt like it'. Claude takes this very badly, and in the following months he repeatedly asks the Director to bring back Albin to him. As the Director never does it, Claude makes a radical decision: he will kill the Director. So one day, he obtains an axe and a pair of scissors at the prison workshop, and waits there for the Director's night time inspection. When the Director arrives, he asks Claude, who isn't supposed to be in the workshop, 'why are you over here?'. Claude then asks the director one last time to free Albin. Once again, the Director refuses. The Director says 'don't mention it again, stop boring me'. Claude again asks why he did this to him, and the Director once again replies 'because I felt like it'. Claude then slices the Directors skull open with the axe and kills him. Immediately afterwards, Claude tries to kill himself with the scissors by repeatedly stabbing them into his own chest.\n\nBut Claude does not die, and a judicial inquiry begins in which he admits murdering the Director and gives the reason as being that \"he felt like it\". He then becomes ill for a few months as a result of his wounds, and when he has fully recovered, he appears before the assize court of Troyes. In court, Claude makes an eloquent speech in which he calmly tells the judge the full details of the events which had provoked him to commit the crime of murder, and he admits his guilt. However, when the King's attorney then states that Claude Gueux had committed the murder unprovoked, Claude becomes angry and he reiterates a long series of acts of extreme provocation on the part of the Director. The president of the court then sums up the case, and in doing so he only mentions the facts about Claude Gueux which are adverse, albeit incontrovertibly true. Claude is then found guilty and sentenced to death.\n\nClaude declines to appeal, but upon returning to the prison, a nun who had nursed him when he was recovering from his wounds, begs him to reconsider. He agrees out of gratitude, although he knows very well his request won't be listened to. In the following days, he is forbidden to come out from his cell or even to go to the workshops. His friends in the prison throw various objects into his room with which he could easily, according to the writer, escape from the jail. But Claude just returns those objects to the guardians.\n\nFinally comes the day in which he is to be executed, his demand for reconsideration having been refused. He is brought to a Catholic priest, to which he asks pardon for all his past sins. He sees the man that will bring an end to his life, and declares he does not consider him guilty of anything and pardons him completely. Then, a coach escorts him to the marketplace of Troyes, where a guillotine has been prepared. Before getting executed, he gives a coin, his only possession, to the priest that has come with him, and asks him to give it to the poor. Then, the guillotine's blade falls upon his neck, and he dies.\n\nA lengthy epilogue follows the story, in which Victor Hugo criticizes the lack of proportionality as between education and criminal punishment, and the cruel French society of the nineteenth century. The last part of his speech is directly meant for French legislators. \n\n"}

Doty attended the Lowville Academy several miles north of Martinsburg in Lowville, New York.\n\nIn 1818, Doty moved to Detroit, the capital of Michigan Territory, where he became an apprentice to Charles Larned, the attorney general. On November 20, 1818, he was admitted to the bar in Wayne County and Michigan Territory. He practiced law until September 29, 1819, when he was appointed clerk of court for Michigan Territory. In June 1820 he resigned the clerkship in order to serve as secretary to the Lewis Cass expedition, a summer-long exploration of the part of Michigan Territory lying west of Lake Michigan as far as the headwaters of the Mississippi River. Upon his return to Detroit, Doty resumed his legal practice. In the winter of 1822 Doty traveled to Washington, D.C., where on March 13, with the sponsorship of Henry Wheaton, he was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nIn 1823, a new federal judicial district was created for northern and western Michigan Territory, covering what is now the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Doty was appointed as the federal judge for the district by President James Monroe. Before taking up his new duties, on April 14, 1823, Doty married Sarah Collins at Whitesboro, New York. Because he was required to live within his district, Doty and his new wife moved from Detroit to Prairie du Chien in 1823. Doty regularly held court at Prairie du Chien, Green Bay, and Mackinac. He also served as the first postmaster of Prairie du Chien from 1823 to 1824. In 1824, Doty moved to Green Bay, where he lived until 1841. Doty remained the district judge until he was replaced by David Irvin in 1832.\n\nFollowing his career as a judge, Doty served as a member of the Michigan Territorial Council from 1834 to 1835, representing the western part of the territory. In this capacity Doty argued for the creation of a new territorial government for Wisconsin, sending petitions to Congress in favor of splitting Michigan Territory into two parts, one east and one west of Lake Michigan. Doty had supported this idea as early as 1824, and argued that the growing number of residents in Wisconsin were not adequately provided for by the territorial government in Detroit, which was hundreds of miles away from any settlement in Wisconsin. Doty claimed that votes sent by residents west of Lake Michigan could not be sent to Detroit in time to be counted, and that the residents in Lower Michigan cared little about the affairs west of the lake. In 1835, his wishes were partially granted when the Governor of Michigan Territory created a separate legislature to govern the western part of the territory as Michigan prepared for statehood.\n\nIn 1835, Doty campaigned to represent western Michigan Territory as a delegate in Congress, but he lost in a three-way election to George Wallace Jones. Both Doty and Jones were running as Democrats, but Doty had little true loyalty to any political party. He was conservative in view and usually aligned himself with whichever people were most popular at any given time. After losing the election, Doty turned to land speculation and bought thousands of acres of land across the state, some of which he began developing into the city of Madison, Wisconsin.\nIn 1836, Wisconsin Territory was officially created. Doty hoped to be the territorial governor, but President Andrew Jackson appointed Henry Dodge, Doty's longtime political rival, to the post. With no public title, Doty worked to improve his land holdings in what would become the city of Madison. Doty had this land surveyed and platted, and made plans to create a city on the isthmus between lakes Mendota and Monona. To gain recognition for the planned city, Doty lobbied the new territorial legislature to select his proposed city as the capital of Wisconsin. A temporary capital had already been established at Belmont, Wisconsin, but its distance from Milwaukee and Green Bay coupled with the dissatisfaction of many legislators towards the facilities at Belmont made it likely that the capital would be moved. Doty used numerous tactics to ensure that Madison would be made capital city, wooing legislators with plans for canals and railroads and offering legislators who voted to make Madison the capital choice lots in the new city. Madison was declared permanent capital in November, 1836, and construction at the new city began in 1837.\n\nIn 1838, Doty was elected as Wisconsin Territory's congressional delegate, defeating George W. Jones in a rematch of the 1835 election. Despite being elected as a Democrat, Doty formed personal friendships with several Whigs in Washington, D.C., including Henry Clay. In 1840, Whig Party candidate William Henry Harrison was elected president, and he made plans to appoint Doty to the governorship of Wisconsin Territory despite Doty's status as a Democrat. Harrison died before he could make the appointment, but vice president John Tyler fulfilled Harrison's desire after ascending to the presidency in 1841. Doty was largely unsuccessful as territorial governor, the Dodge supporters in the territorial legislature rejected most of the legislation Doty supported, and Doty failed on four separate occasions to get public support for Wisconsin statehood. Doty's term ended in 1844, and he was not reappointed by Tyler, who instead selected Nathaniel P. Tallmadge to the post. This left Doty to once again return to his private life.\n\nIn 1846, Doty returned to politics, this time as a delegate to the First Wisconsin Constitutional Convention. Doty came to the convention as an independent, but sided with the Whigs on most issues and emerged as the opposition leader at the convention, which had a clear Democratic majority. After much debate, the convention produced a constitution, but the state's residents considered the document to be too radical and voted it down in a referendum, despite public campaigns for the constitution led by Doty and other delegates. A second convention called in late 1847 produced a constitution that was accepted by the people, and this enabled Wisconsin to achieve statehood in 1848. Doty was elected to the United States House of Representatives shortly after Wisconsin became a state, and served from 1849 to 1853 as the representative of Wisconsin's newly created 3rd congressional district and served as part of the 31st and 32nd Congresses. He was replaced by John B. Macy. After leaving Congress, Doty left public life and retired to his home on an island (now named Doty Island) between Neenah and Menasha, Wisconsin. His log-cabin home, relocated from the east end of the island, is located in Doty Park on the southeastern riverfront of Doty Island (on the island's Neenah side). It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1861, Doty returned to public service when Republican President Abraham Lincoln appointed him to the position of Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Utah Territory. Doty was successful in this position. In 1863, Stephen Selwyn Harding, Utah's territorial governor, was removed from office after public backlash from his criticism of the LDS Church and the practice of polygamy. Lincoln appointed Doty to the governorship shortly thereafter. As governor, Doty was able to repair the relationship between the federal government and the territory's Mormons. Doty also promoted the construction of schools and negotiations with local Native American tribes.\n\n\nDoty died in office at age 65 on June 13, 1865, shortly after the outbreak of Utah's Black Hawk War. He was buried at the Fort Douglas Cemetery in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n"}

He started his playing career as an amateur for his local team AA Rekem, before achieving success with Standard Liège and PSV. At his peak he was regarded as one of the top right-backs in Europe. The combination of his warrior's heart, beard and dark long hair earned him the nickname \"The Lion (of Flanders)\".\n\nConsidered one of the greatest players in Belgian football history, he is famous for having captained PSV to their first and only European Cup win in 1988.\n\nAs a coach, he is best known for his advocacy of systems thinking. He is also one of six managers – along with José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Giovanni Trapattoni, Tomislav Ivić and Ernst Happel – to have won domestic league championships in at least four countries.\n\nGerets began his career playing for amateur side AA Rekem before joining then titleholders Standard de Liège. Making his debut 16 April 1972 coming on for Silvester Takač against FC Diest. In the 1972–73 season Standard reached the Cup final, manager Vlatko Marković let Gerets start despite not being an established first team member as Standard lost 2–1 to fierce rivals Anderlecht. The following season, Gerets replaced 29-year-old Jacques Beurlet and became the first choice right back for the Rouches. In 1975 Gerets made his debut for the national team.\n\nGerets played for Standard Liège, Milan, MVV Maastricht and PSV, winning among others the 1987–88 European Cup, two Belgian championships and six Dutch championships.\n\nGerets was an offensively-minded right back, known for his stamina, tactical discipline, grit and mental toughness. He was also known for long distance throw-ins.\n\nHe is the third-most capped player for the Belgium national team, with 86 appearances and two goals.\n\nIn the 1980s, a new generation of players emerged at Standard. Noted manager Ernst Happel was hired, and later the club brought Raymond Goethals back to Belgium. Players like Arie Haan, Guy Vandersmissen, Michel Preud'homme, Walter Meeuws, Jos Daerden and Simon Tahamata became key players, whilst Gerets was the captain of the team. In 1980, Standard finished runners-up in the league, before winning the 1981 National Cup with a 4–1 win over Lokeren SC. In 1982, Standard won the title by beating Waterschei SV Thor in the last match of the season. A few days later, they faced Barcelona in the European Cup Winners' Cup final, which they lost 2–1. The influence of Gerets on Standard's success was recognised when he was awarded the 1982 Belgian Golden Shoe. The following year he captained Standard to another league title, their ninth overall, which would prove to be their last until 2007–08.\n\nIn 1985, Gerets joined PSV playing together with Ruud Gullit, Frank Arnesen, Huub Stevens and Willy van de Kerkhof followed by Brazilian star Romário. In 1986, Gerets won the title with PSV, and after the departure of Gullit in 1987, Gerets became the new captain. Under Guus Hiddink PSV won the league and cup double three years in a row, Gerets scoring twice in the cup final against Roda JC. In 1988 PSV reached the UEFA European Cup final facing Benfica. After 120 minutes, it was still 0–0; PSV eventually won on penalties.\n\nIn 1990, Bobby Robson was appointed as Hiddink's successor. Under Robson, Gerets won another two titles with PSV then he retired at the end of the 1991–1992 season at the age of 37.\n\nGerets registered 86 caps for the Belgium national team, making him the third-most capped player in their history. He made his debut for the squad in 1975, and played at four major tournaments: the 1980 European Championship, 1982 World Cup, 1986 World Cup, and 1990 World Cup.\n\nIn 1980, Gerets played in his first European Championship in Italy. He scored the opening goal in a 2–1 win against Spain which ensured Belgium qualified as group winners. The tournament is remembered for the inspired performance of the offensively-minded Belgium (around rising stars such as Jan Ceulemans, Eric Gerets, Jean-Marie Pfaff and Erwin Vandenbergh) who unexpectedly reached the final, only losing to West Germany (1–2) by a Hrubesch goal two minutes from time.\n\nAt the 1982 World Cup, Belgium, captained by Gerets, recorded one of their most famous victories with a 1–0 win over defending champions Argentina in the first game of the tournament held at Camp Nou with a goal by Erwin Vandenbergh, and an excellent defensive display to hold off a young Diego Maradona.\n\nFour years later, they achieved their best World Cup run at that time in 1986 when they placed fourth under command of players like Jan Ceulemans, Jean-Marie Pfaff and captain Gerets. Belgium surprisingly won against favourites the Soviet Union with stars such as Igor Belanov and Rinat Dasayev (3–4) after extra time. Belgium also beat Spain on penalties, but they lost to eventual champions Argentina in the semi-final (0–2), inspired by Maradona. Despite their defeat, Belgium would end up in fourth place – their best finish in World Cup competition until it was surpassed in 2018 when they reached third place.\n\nGerets would also captain his nation to the 1990 World Cup finals. Belgium failed to convert their chances against England in the second round. They lost in the last minute of extra time after a goal by David Platt.\n\nAs a manager, Gerets worked successively for FC Liège, Lierse, Club Brugge, PSV, 1. FC Kaiserslautern and VfL Wolfsburg before joining Galatasaray at the end of the 2004–05 season. In the 1996–97 season, he won the Belgian championships with Lierse, reprising the feat in the season 1998–99 with Club Brugge. He also won the Dutch championships twice (1999–2000 and 2000–01) with PSV. In the 2005–06 season, Gerets won the Turkish Premier Super League with Galatasaray. In May 2007, he left the club, and on 25 September became Marseille's coach.\n\nIn his first year with Marseille in 2007, he managed to get the team from the bottom of the league up to finish their 2007–08 season in third place. On 29 April 2009, he confirmed that he would not be in charge of Marseille after the summer when his contract expired. On 26 May 2009, he signed a contract to take over as head coach of Saudi club Al-Hilal for two years for an annual fee of €1.8 million. On 6 July 2010, he signed a four-year contract with Morocco. He would do the job part-time until he completed the Asian Champions League campaign with Al Hilal but stranded in the semi-finals. He was in charge of Morocco for almost two years. He was sacked on 15 September 2012 after a Morocco's 2–0 defeat against Mozambique in the first-leg of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualification.\n\nLess than a month after leaving Morocco, he accepted a contract offer to become the head coach of Qatari defending champions Lekhwiya on 9 October 2012.\n\nGerets departed Lekhwiya and became the head coach of the United Arab Emirates team Al Jazira Club on 20 May 2014.\n\nStandard Liège\n\nPSV\n\nBelgium\n\nIndividual\n\nLierse\n\nClub Brugge\n\nPSV\n\nGalatasaray\n\nAl-Hilal\n\nMorocco\n\nLekhwiya\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

He was the eldest son of Robert (c.1651–1716) and Lydia Armstrong (c.1649–1715), originally from the Scottish Borders and distantly related to the notorious reiver Johnnie Armstrong. He had two sisters, Lydia (1680-1715) and Elizabeth (1679-ca 1730); his brothers Samuel (1676-1710) and Michael (1678-1757) also served in the army.\n\nIn 1710, he married Anna Burroughs (ca 1690-1725) and they had five daughters, Lydia (1718-1775), Anne (1719-1783), Frances (1720-1763), Mary (1721-1790) and Priscilla (1725-?). \n\nThe 1688 Glorious Revolution sent James II into exile and in an attempt to regain his kingdoms, he landed in Ireland in March 1689, launching the Williamite War in Ireland; in 1691, Armstrong joined the Duke of Ormonde's Horse Guards, part of the Williamite army. Captured by Jacobite forces, he was released when the war ended with the October 1691 Treaty of Limerick and in 1695, he enrolled in his relative Philip Armstrong's troop, part of Wood's Regiment of Horse, later 3rd Dragoon Guards. After the Nine Years War ended with the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, the regiment returned to England.\n\nAt the start of the War of the Spanish Succession, he served at Cadiz under Ormonde, who recommended him to Holcroft Blood (1660-1707), Marlborough's chief engineer. Armstrong served in the Flanders campaign, including Blenheim in 1704 and the Siege of Bouchain in 1711. He worked with fellow engineer and long-time acquaintance Thomas Lascelles and they remained close colleagues until Armstrong's death in 1742. He managed to retain his positions through the political struggles of 1712-1715 and was appointed Quartermaster-General to the Forces just before the war ended with the 1713 Peace of Utrecht.\n\nThe treaty included the provision that France 'level the fortifications of Dunkirk, block up the port and demolish the sluices that scour the harbour, (which) shall never be reconstructed.' For decades before and after, Dunkirk was a major privateer base for raiding British merchantmen, since it was possible to reach the North Sea in a single tide and escape Royal Navy patrols in the Channel. This made it a high profile operation of great significance to the powerful London mercantile interest and in September 1713, Armstrong and his colleague Thomas Lascelles were appointed to supervise operations. \n\nAfter the accession of George I in 1714, Marlborough was restored as Master-General of the Ordnance and initiated a series of reforms. Armstrong became Chief Royal Engineer, with his predecessor Michael Richards as Surveyor-General of the Ordnance; on his recommendation, the Ordnance Service was divided in 1716 into artillery and sappers or engineers, later the Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery. In May, Armstrong was at The Foundery in Moorfields watching a demonstration of captured French cannon being recast when an explosion killed 17 of the 25 people present; he was one of the very few to escape injury and the accident led to the institution of the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. \n\nHe returned to England in 1718 with Lascelles taking over at Dunkirk; in addition to his official duties, he was involved in multiple activities, becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1723. His proposals for improving port facilities at King's Lynn were included as an appendix to Thomas Badeslade's 1725 work 'History of the ancient and present state of the navigation of the port of King's Lyn.' In the 1720s, he designed and constructed a lake at Blenheim Palace, later replaced by a Capability Brown feature. \n\nHe was closely involved in setting up the Royal Arsenal and Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, served as Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Ireland from 1735 to 1742 and promoted Major-General in 1739. Late in 1741, he was taken ill at his office in the Tower of London where he died on 15 April 1742; he was buried in the chapel attached to the Tower, the Church of St Peter ad Vincula.\n\n"}

The work of the Düsseldorf School is characterized by finely detailed yet fanciful landscapes, often with religious or allegorical stories set in the landscapes. Major members of the Düsseldorf School advocated \"plein air painting\", and tended to use a palette with relatively subdued and even colors. The Düsseldorf School derived from and was a part of German Romantic styles. Prominent members of the Düsselorf School included von Schadow, Karl Friedrich Lessing, Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, Andreas Achenbach, Hans Fredrik Gude, Adolph Tidemand, Oswald Achenbach, and Adolf Schrödter.\n\nThe Düsseldorf School had a significant influence on the Hudson River School in the United States, and many prominent Americans trained at the Düsseldorf Academy and show the influence of the Düsseldorf School, including George Caleb Bingham, David Edward Cronin, Eastman Johnson, Worthington Whittredge, Richard Caton Woodville, William Stanley Haseltine, James McDougal Hart, Helen Searle, and William Morris Hunt, as well as German émigré Emanuel Leutze.

{"id": "2220145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220145", "title": "Dick Dietz", "text": "Dick Dietz\n\nRichard Allen Dietz (September 18, 1941 – June 28, 2005) was an American professional baseball player. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball for the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Atlanta Braves from 1966 to 1973.\n\nBorn in Crawfordsville, Indiana, Dietz was signed by the San Francisco Giants as an amateur free agent out of Greenville, South Carolina before the start of the 1960 season. He showed some promise as a hitter, posting a .354 batting average with 35 home runs and 101 runs batted in while playing for the El Paso Sun Kings in the Texas League in 1963.\n\nDietz made his major league debut with the Giants on June 18, 1966 at the age of 24. Nicknamed \"Mule\", he played as the Giants backup catcher behind Tom Haller in 1967. In September, Dietz was named to the 1967 Topps All-Star Rookie Team. In February 1968, the Giants were in need of good infielders, and with four young catching prospects in their system, including Dietz, club president Chub Feeney decided to trade Haller along with a player to be named later, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Ron Hunt and Nate Oliver. Dietz shared catching duties with Jack Hiatt and Bob Barton in 1968, producing a .272 batting average with 6 home runs and 38 runs batted in.\n\nDietz is remembered for his role in a controversial umpiring decision during the 1968 season. The Giants were facing Dodgers' pitcher Don Drysdale, who was in the midst of a scoreless inning streak that eventually reached a record-setting innings. The Giants had the bases loaded with no outs and Dietz at bat. Dietz was hit by a pitch, apparently ending Drysdale's scoreless innings streak. However, home plate umpire Harry Wendelstedt, citing a rarely enforced rule, refused to allow Dietz to take first base, claiming that Dietz did not attempt to avoid being struck by the ball. Drysdale then retired Dietz and the next two batters, keeping his scoreless streak alive. Dietz was the Giants catcher on September 17, 1968, when Gaylord Perry pitched a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1969, Dietz continued to share the catching duties with Hiatt and Barton. When the other two players were traded before the start of the 1970 season, Dietz became the Giants' regular starting catcher.\n\nIn his first season as a full-time player in 1970, Dietz hit for a .337 batting average with 18 home runs and 77 runs batted in at mid-season. Although he was not listed on the All-Star ballot and received few write-in votes, the manager for the National League All-Star team, Gil Hodges, named Dietz as a reserve player for the National League team. In the 1970 All-Star Game, Dietz replaced Johnny Bench in the top of the seventh inning and led off the bottom of the ninth inning with a home run off Catfish Hunter that helped spark a rally that tied the game. The National League went on to win the game in the twelfth inning with a climactic collision at home plate between Pete Rose and Ray Fosse (It was Dietz who was in the on deck circle, congratulating Rose immediately after the collision). He ended the 1970 season with career-highs in batting average (.300), home runs (22), runs batted in (107), walks (109) and in on-base percentage (.426). His 1970 season remains historic as of 2009, as he is the only catcher to tally 100 walks, 100 RBI and hit .300 in the same Major League Baseball season.\n\nDietz was an integral member of the 1971 Giants team that clinched the National League Western Division title. The Giants had a nine-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 1, but held on during a pennant race to win the division by a narrow one-game margin. Dietz caught every game during the tense final stages of the season, and provided offensive support with 19 home runs and 72 runs batted in. In the only post-season appearance of his career, Dietz had only one hit in 15 at-bats, as the Giants lost to the eventual world champion Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1971 National League Championship Series.\n\nIn 1972, Dietz fell from favor with the Giants' management for his role as player representative during the 1972 Major League Baseball strike that delayed the start of the season. Other reports stated that the Giants gave up on Dietz because of his defensive liabilities, having led National League catchers in passed balls in 1970 and 1971. Soon after the strike was settled, he was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Dietz broke his wrist on July 30 and missed much of the 1972 season. In 1973, Dietz had an excellent season as a reserve first baseman and catcher for the Braves, batting .295 with a .474 on-base percentage. However, the Braves released him after the season, and after no team signed him for 1974, Dietz' career was over at the age of 32.\n\nIn an eight-year major league career, Dietz played in 646 games, accumulating 478 hits in 1,829 at bats for a .261 career batting average along with 66 home runs, 301 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .390. Although he was better known for his power hitting, he was a capable defensive catcher, ending his career with a .981 fielding percentage.\n\nAfter his retirement as a player, Dietz served as a minor league coach and manager. He managed the San Jose Giants in 1993 and 1994, the Sioux Falls Canaries in 1995 and the Sonoma County Crushers from 1996 to 1999.\n\nDietz died at age 63 of a heart attack in Clayton, Georgia on June 28, 2005. He was survived by his wife and children.\n\n"}

Greg Valentine had also held the WWF Tag Team Championship with Brutus Beefcake as one half of The Dream Team.\n\nIn 1988, The Hart Foundation turned face and started a feud with former manager Jimmy Hart for picking The Fabulous Rougeaus over them. Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine teamed up (under the team name of “Double Trouble,“ though the announcers rarely used this name) to defend Jimmy Hart through the early parts of 1989 with the two teams facing off at WrestleMania V with the Hart Foundation winning the match. After the loss Honky Tonk Man and Valentine focused on singles feuds with \"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka and ”Rugged” Ronnie Garvin respectively.\n\nAfter the Fabulous Rougeaus left the WWF, Jimmy Hart reunited the Hammer and the Honky Tonk Man, gave them the team name “Rhythm and Blues,” and made changes to Greg Valentine’s appearance. Valentine had always been a blonde, ungimmicked wrestler who favored the traditional wrestling robe, but when teamed with the Honky Tonk Man, Valentine’s hair got dyed jet black, he was given Elvis style shades, a white jacket and a guitar he quite obviously did not know how to play. Commentator Gorilla Monsoon nicknamed Greg Valentine “Boxcar” when he saw his changed appearance (most likely after Blues singer “Boxcar Willie”). As a commentator, Roddy Piper once opined \"Elvis would be turnin' over in his grave if he was dead.\" In an interview for \"World Wrestling Insanity\", the Honky Tonk Man states the team name was a suggestion made by Rick Rude.\n\nPerhaps their most memorable moment came at WrestleMania VI when they were driven to the ring in a pink Cadillac driven by the then unknown Diamond Dallas Page. In the ring, they debuted their new song, \"Hunka Hunka Honky Love\"; the song was interrupted by The Bushwhackers who attacked them and broke their guitars much to the delight of the fans. The two teams had a lengthy feud over the summer of 1990 before Rhythm and Blues challenged the tag team champions the Hart Foundation for the titles during the fall. The team had several shots at the gold but came up short every time.\n\nAt the 1990 Survivor Series, Rhythm and Blues partnered with Ted DiBiase on his \"Million Dollar Team\" along with the debuting Undertaker, taking on Dusty Rhodes' \"Dream Team\" of the Hart Foundation and Koko B. Ware. DiBiase would go on to be the only survivor for his team.\n\nNear the end of 1990 the Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine started arguing when Greg Valentine got tired of Jimmy Hart’s interference in their matches. This was supposed to lead to a feud between Greg Valentine and the Honky Tonk Man but the Honky Tonk Man left the federation in January 1991 thus nullifying the feud.\n\nAt some point after both men left the WWF the team reunited in the Northern States Wrestling Alliance where they won the tag team titles once.\n\n\n\n"}
