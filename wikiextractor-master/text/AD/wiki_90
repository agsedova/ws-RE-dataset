{"id": "2304704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304704", "title": "Mirror punishment", "text": "Mirror punishment\n\nA mirror punishment is a penal form of poetic justice which reflects the nature or means of the crime in the means of (often physical) punishment as a form of retributive justice—the practice of \"repaying\" a wrongdoer \"in kind\".\n\nIt can be an application of the \"lex talionis\" (“an eye for an eye”), but is not always proportional justice, as a similar method may be used to produce a worse or milder effect than the crime it \"retaliates\".\n\nThe simplest method of mirror punishment is to enact the same action upon the criminal as the criminal perpetrated upon the victim. For example, thieves have the same amount of money taken from them as they stole, one who strikes another is struck in the same way, one who willfully causes another person's death is killed, and so on.\n\nOften, however, a more esoteric method of mirror punishment is used, which implies punishing the part of the criminal's body used to commit the crime. Extreme examples include the amputation of the hands of a thief, as still permitted by Sharia law, or during the Middle Ages in Europe, or disabling the foot or leg of a runaway slave. \nWhen the Halifax Gibbet was used as a method of execution, if the offender was to be executed for stealing an animal, a cord was fastened to the pin and tied to either the stolen animal or one of the same species, which was then driven off, withdrawing the pin and allowing the blade to drop.\n\nOther examples include the punishment of adulterous women by the insertion of irritating substances into their vaginas (in the past hot pokers were sometimes used). A less extreme example is putting soap into a child's mouth for using inappropriate language (referred to in English as \"washing out the mouth with soap\"). \n\nAnother method to accomplish \"poetic justice\" is to mirror the physical method of the crime, e.g., executing a murderer with his own weapon, burning arsonists alive, or in a more far-fetched example, boiling a counterfeiter alive (because bullion is boiled to be minted).\n\nW. S. Gilbert's comic opera \"The Mikado\" contains a song satirizing mirror punishment:\n\nThe refrain line \"to let the punishment fit the crime\" has sometimes been quoted in the course of British political debates, though the concept predates Gilbert.\n\n"}

{"id": "2304707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304707", "title": "Kakanui", "text": "Kakanui\n\nThe small town of Kakanui lies on the coast of Otago, in New Zealand, fourteen kilometres to the south of Oamaru. The Kakanui River and its estuary divide the township in two. The part of the settlement south of the river, also known as Kakanui South, formerly \"Campbells Bay\", was developed as a collection of cribs (holiday homes). A recent increase in the development of subdivisions has increased the density of dwellings within South Kakanui. The population was 372 people in the 2013 New Zealand census, a decrease of 42 from 2006.\n\nThe Kakanui River reaches the sea near the town, and the low range known as the Kakanui Mountains stretches inland from south of Oamaru towards the Maniototo. Kai Tahu used to temporarily occupy Kakanui as they travelled north and south, as evidenced by the midden on the north side of the estuary.\n\nThe area around Kakanui has a reputation for its limestone formations, and produces many fossils. Quarrying formerly took place. The rich and fertile soil of the area around the river has physical properties which make it perfect for use in sports grounds, especially cricket pitches. Many of New Zealand's top cricket venues use Kakanui soil on their wicket blocks.\n\nKakanui's main beach, south of the main headland, is known as Campbell's Bay. It provides the first surfable break and the first safe swimming beach (apart from Timaru's Caroline Bay) south of Banks Peninsula. The beach has a length of approximately two kilometres, and the southern end, known as All Day Bay, offers more shelter than the northern end, but with less surf. The sandy beach below the shingle spit north of the river mouth stretching toward Oamaru is safely swimmable. The beaches south of the main headland feature orange sand. The northern beach has white sand.\n\nKakanui's rich volcanic soil suits intensive horticulture. The township contains a number of glasshouses, primarily used for growing tomatoes, but also producing cucumbers and capsicums (bell peppers). Land surrounding the settlement (especially to the north towards the settlement of Totara) also features market gardens (often operated by Chinese New Zealanders) growing a wide range of vegetables. Kakanui has a particular reputation for its new-season potatoes, which sell throughout all New Zealand.\n\nKakanui (originally \"Kakaunui\") was once a bustling port on the northern side of the river, with a hotel, blacksmith, meat works, and a post office. Kakanui's commerce declined after the construction of the railway inland (going through Maheno) and with the advent of the frozen-meat trade from 1882.\n\nKakanui is often named on maps as \"Taranui\". However, this name is not in use locally, nor is it evident on road signs. \"Taranui\" may be a naming error from early maps referring to a station farm of that name, located slightly inland from Kakanui.\n"}
{"id": "2304719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304719", "title": "Vala Mal Doran", "text": "Vala Mal Doran\n\nVala Mal Doran is a fictional character in the American military science fiction television series \"Stargate SG-1\", a science fiction show about a military team exploring the galaxy via a network of alien transportation devices. Played by former \"Farscape\" actress Claudia Black, Vala was created by Damian Kindler and Robert C. Cooper as a guest character for the season 8 episode \"Prometheus Unbound\" (2004). Because of the on-screen chemistry between Black's Vala and Michael Shanks' character Daniel Jackson, and the character's popularity with the producers and the audience, Claudia Black became a recurring guest star in season 9 (2005–2006) and joined the main cast in season 10 (2006–2007).\n\n\"Prometheus Unbound\" introduces Vala as a sexy and mischievous human with a Goa'uld background from an unnamed planet. In season 9, Vala and Daniel set off the arc of the show's new villain race, the Ori. After giving birth to the Ori's new leader in season 10, Vala joins the SG-1 team to stop the enemy, eventually becoming a permanent member of both SG-1 and Stargate Command. Claudia Black resumed her role in the 2008 direct-to-DVD film \"\", which finishes the Ori arc. Black also appeared as Vala and her Goa'uld alter ego Qetesh in the 2008 film \"\". She was, however, not supposed to be returning for the announced third \"Stargate SG-1\" direct-to-DVD film that was scheduled to be filmed in spring 2009, but abandoned since then. For her portrayal of Vala, Claudia Black was nominated for a 2006 Saturn Award in the category \"Best Supporting Actress on Television\", and won a Constellation Award in the category \"Best Female Performance in a 2006 Science Fiction Television\" in 2007.\n\nInformation about Vala's past is revealed over the course of several episodes of seasons 8 through 10 of \"Stargate SG-1\". \"Family Ties\" gives insight into Vala's background with her father Jacek, a con artist who had left her and her mother to pursue his scams. As mentioned in \"Flesh and Blood\", Vala also had a stepmother named Adria, whom she held in little regard. Vala became an involuntary host to a Goa'uld named Qetesh in her adult life, but the Tok'ra were able to remove the symbiote. At the time of Vala's first encounter with SG-1 team member Daniel Jackson in the season 8 episode \"Prometheus Unbound\", she has become a thief and a con artist. She attempts to steal the Earth ship \"Prometheus\" for her own purposes, but when Daniel evades her sexual advances and thwarts her plans, she escapes.\n\nIn the season 9 opener \"Avalon\", Vala seeks out Daniel at Stargate Command. Needing his linguistic skills, she uses a Kor mak bracelet to bind them together for a treasure hunt on Earth. The discovery of an Ancient communication device transports Vala's and Daniel's minds to a village in a distant galaxy where the local villagers kill Vala in a trial by fire, but a Prior, a servant of a race named the Ori, resurrects her. After Vala's and Daniel's safe return to Earth, the removed bracelets cause temporary after-effects that prolong Vala's stay at Stargate Command. In an attempt to stop the Ori from invading the galaxy in \"Beachhead\", Vala goes missing and appears to have died. Vala re-appears in the late season 9 episode \"Crusade\" and informs SG-1 via the communication device that she is in the Ori galaxy. The Ori have impregnated her against her will many months before, and Vala saw herself forced to marry a local villager named Tomin to make the pregnancy plausible. When Vala tells SG-1 about the Ori army approaching, the communication link is severed. Vala is last seen onboard one of the invading Ori battlecruisers in the closing scene of the season 9 finale \"Camelot\" when she goes into labor.\n\nSeason 10 opens with Vala giving birth to a female. The Ori call the rapidly growing child Orici, but Vala gives her the name Adria after her stepmother. Attempts to turn the child away from the Ori remain unsuccessful. Having escaped the Ori, Vala is allowed sanctuary at Stargate Command and joins SG-1 on several missions, during one of which she comes face-to-face with her fully-grown daughter. Vala's provisionary acceptance on Earth is only lifted in the eighth episode of the season, \"Memento Mori\", in which she is finally made a full member of SG-1. Vala meets Tomin again in \"Line in the Sand\" and tells him the true story behind the Ancients and Ori. A final showdown in the series between Vala and Adria occurs in \"Dominion\", which leaves Vala with the loss of her daughter. In \"Unending\", the last episode of the series, SG-1 gets stuck in a time dilation field aboard the Earth ship \"Odyssey\", and a romance between Vala and Daniel finally comes to fruition. Before the time dilation field is reversed after fifty years, erasing all linked memories in the process, Daniel and Vala express their feelings for each other. The Ori story concludes with Adria's disempowerment and Vala's and Tomin's amicable separation in the 2008 direct-to-DVD film \"\". Vala and her alter ego, Qetesh, appear in the alternate-timeline film \"\".\n\nOfficial \"Stargate\" sources advertised Vala as a \"scheming, unscrupulous, thieving con artist\", \"feisty\" and \"occasionally fickle\", with a \"mysterious agenda\" and a seemingly \"amorous interest in Dr. Daniel Jackson\". Genre magazine \"TV Zone\" subtitled Vala as a \"thief, arms dealer, mercenary\" who, when given an inch, will \"take a mile, and whatever else she can get her hands on.\" \"SFX\" described Vala as a \"mischievous minx\", whereas \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" interpreted Vala as \"ethically challenged\". Steven Eramo of \"Starburst\" gave Vala the attributes \"sexy, smart and always resourceful\". Claudia Black characterized early Vala as \"sassy\", \"intelligent\", \"manipulative\", and \"mercurial\", but found it \"very hard to tell what the real core of Vala is.\" Black later described Vala as \"a new, weird element\", \"irritating\", \"very vibrant\", \"sort of the hair-pulling variety\", \"really infuriating\" and \"[hopefully] funny\". With Vala being a departure from Black's former \"Farscape\" role as Aeryn Sun, Black regarded Vala as a comedic and energetic character with streaks of irreverence and naughtiness who \"says everything that everyone else is thinking, but doesn't dare say\", although both characters share \"being damaged goods [in the beginning] and on a path to becoming a better person\". Robert C. Cooper thought of Vala as \"a bit of a wild card\" and \"a very sexy character, who isn't afraid to take whatever she wants in any given situation.\" Cooper and Black believed the character had a moral compass to her actions.\n\nClaudia Black and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) linked their characters' early relationship to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of \"not so much of tension, but rather constant antagonism\". Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel that he had not had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial. The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry. Michael Shanks stated that by \"Memento Mori\", \"Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and wants that process to continue.\" From Black's point of view, Daniel offers \"an interesting window\" into \"Vala's external façade to be playful with people\". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to \"develop coping mechanisms that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's OK to be honest and talk how you feel.\" Asked about a possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry. When producer Robert C. Cooper presented his preliminary script for the series finale, \"Unending\", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that \"[t]here's always been this underlining, keeping [Vala] at arms length because of the fear of getting too close.\" After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character.\n\nDescribing Vala's attitude towards bonding with other characters as \"in a strange way quite level-headed\" and \"quite honest\", Black interpreted Vala's behavior as a reaction to growing attached to people where the relationships never seem to work out. Cooper explained that by Vala's contacting of Stargate Command about the imminent threat at the end of season 9, she \"has reached a point of honesty with [the SG-1] characters and possibly herself on a level that she's never had before.\" From the beginning of season 10, Claudia Black and Amanda Tapping requested a similarly positive camaraderie between their characters as male characters have. Tapping noted Carter's respect for Vala despite them being at opposite ends in their actions; Tapping also thought Carter finds Vala amusing rather than annoying. A scene in \"Morpheus\" that was intended to establish this relationship was cut for time, and until the late season 10 episode \"Family Ties\" would accommodate this with a shopping scene, the actresses acknowledged their connection through looks and subtle nuances. By joining SG-1, Vala also shared a spot with stoic warrior Teal'c as the only alien members of the team, and actor Christopher Judge (Teal'c) explained that his character's amusement with Vala contributed to Teal'c's loosening up. The relationship between Vala and SG-1 team leader Colonel Cameron Mitchell (played by Ben Browder) was rarely emphasized in the series since Black and Browder were well known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series \"Farscape\".\n\nAccording to Black, Vala's motivation to hide her miraculous pregnancy by marrying the local villager Tomin (played by Tim Guinee) in late season 9 stems from \"genuinely car[ing] for the man. She does something wrong, but she must in order to survive.\" Against the audience's expectation, Vala and Tomin are shown as a seemingly functioning normal couple, and Vala makes several efforts to save him despite his deep indoctrination. Throughout season 10, Vala has to come to terms with her maternal feelings for Adria (as adult played by Morena Baccarin), well knowing from the beginning that Adria embodies a destructive entity that must be fought. Black believed Vala had to \"try her best to connect with her daughter in the hope of finding ways to humanize her\", despite her own lack of maturity. When Vala meets her father Jacek (Fred Willard) in \"Family Ties\", Vala shows \"a slightly more dramatic and vulnerable side\" that was new to the audience.\n\n\"Stargate SG-1\" supervising producer Damian Kindler wrote \"Prometheus Unbound\" as a second-unit bottle episode for the middle of \"Stargate SG-1\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> season 8 in 2004. The main cast's availability was limited, as Richard Dean Anderson had a reduced season schedule, and Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge filmed \"Gemini\" in parallel to \"Prometheus Unbound\". Kindler therefore centered the episode on Michael Shanks' character Daniel Jackson and created Vala, a human character from an unnamed planet, as Daniel's one-episode adversary. Not fully content with Kindler's conservative approach, producer Robert C. Cooper amplified the character's cheeky and sexy personality in his own passes of the script. Although Cooper tried to respect \"Stargate SG-1\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> reputation as a sex-free family show, he was aware that the character's flirtatiousness might cause a strong audience reaction.\n\nRobert. C. Cooper suggested Australian actress Claudia Black for the role of Vala and contacted her agent two days before the filming of \"Prometheus Unbound\" began. The \"Stargate\" producers had approached Black several times before, but she had always been busy with other projects. At \"Prometheus Unbound\"'s casting stage, the actress had just finished dialogue looping sessions for \"\" in Australia. She thought the script of \"Prometheus Unbound\" was funny and self-contained enough for creative experiments, so she accepted the role and called the episode's director, Andy Mikita, in advance. He suggested an \"Out of Sight\"-kind chemistry for Vala and Daniel, and encouraged the actress to push the character as far as possible. On set, Claudia Black and Michael Shanks decided to make one of their first scenes, a fight sequence, as funny and non-machismo as possible to mirror Daniel's non-military background. In the meantime, Black tried to transform her day-long jetlag and lack of sleep into humour. When the producers saw the on-screen chemistry between Black and Shanks, they decided to make the character a bigger part of the show.\n\nWith actor Richard Dean Anderson's departure from the show in 2005, \"Stargate SG-1\" saw cast changes at the beginning of season 9. Ben Browder and Beau Bridges joined the main cast as Lieutenant-Colonel Cameron Mitchell and Major General Hank Landry, respectively. At the same time, the producers re-introduced Vala in a six-episode story arc to cover for the maternity leave of \"SG-1\" regular Amanda Tapping (Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter). The producer intended to use Vala's unpredictability and wildcard status to break the bigger story arc and to acquaint the audience with the new characters. Claudia Black wished to broaden her horizon in comedic acting and agreed to the recurring role, but declined the producers' offer of a permanent role for personal reasons.\n\nBecause Ben Browder and Claudia Black were well known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series \"Farscape\", the \"Stargate\" producers refrained from emphasizing the pairing of Mitchell and Vala beyond in-jokes. The producers instead opted to further the comedic chemistry between Claudia Black and Michael Shanks, who linked their characters' early relationship to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of \"not so much of tension, but rather constant antagonism\". Mirroring Vala's sexiness in season 8, \"The Powers That Be\" writer Martin Gero chose Qetesh, the Egyptian Goddess of Love and Beauty, as a fitting former Goa'uld identity for Vala. Nevertheless, Black and the producers refrained from portraying the character as too sexually manipulative. A scene from \"The Ties That Bind\", which was later cut for time, originally made clear that Wallace Shawn's character greatly exaggerated the sexual relationship between him and Vala. Claudia Black was brought back into the show for the last two episodes of season 9, at which time the actress was seven months pregnant. Producer Robert C. Cooper, who wrote and directed \"Crusade\", used the circumstances to set the stage for Adria, Vala's future daughter and the show's new villain in season 10.\n\nClaudia Black joined the cast full-time in season 10. Had \"Stargate SG-1\" not been picked up for a new season, the producers would have considered the character for a spin-off series. To justify the character in a regular capacity, the producers toned her down and tried to find a suitable balance of sexual tension, fun and friendship. Claudia Black was convinced that Vala's actual stay with Stargate Command was justified despite the character's personality. Vala's renegade qualification to infiltrate the Ori served as a useful compliment to the military-oriented SG teams, and Vala had already proven a degree of allegiance through her actions in \"Beachhead\", holding off an immediate invasion of the enemy. The writers tested this loyalty through confrontation in the story, and writer Damian Kindler later compared Vala's character growth in season 10 to smuggler Lando Calrissian from \"Star Wars\", a \"former swindler who's gone legit\". Careful to never have Vala become too earnest, Kindler never saw Vala \"as the type of character who should be on the show for five, six, seven years. But definitely the sort of character who could come in for a couple of seasons, spice things up and then move on and come back and forth.\" Evolving the relationship between Vala and the other SG-1 members, the producers also grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them \"end[ing] up in a motel room bed together\" in the episode \"Memento Mori\", involving underwear, \"handcuffs as well as creamy Twinkies\". A scene in the milestone episode \"200\" also parodied the show's connection to \"Farscape\". In hindsight, Claudia Black would see season 10 as a personal challenge as her baby deprived her of sleep during the filming period. Her relocation to Vancouver and sickness in the family put her on a self-confessed personal and professional low. She nevertheless tried to stay true to her character \"and not go for the cheap laugh\".\n\nAfter a miscarriage scare during the filming of the first direct-to-DVD \"SG-1\" film, \"\", Claudia Black's work on the film \"\" was limited on strict doctor's orders. Although Black considered \"Continuum\" \"not a Vala-centric piece\" as she only \"makes a brief appearance\", \"Stargate\" producer Joseph Mallozzi thought \"she's got some great, juicy scenes\". Claudia Black mentioned an interest in portraying her character in the future, but Mallozzi rated the chances of her appearing in the planned \"Stargate Universe\" spin-off series as \"not so good\". Producer Brad Wright announced that Vala would not be returning for the announced third \"Stargate SG-1\" direct-to-DVD film that was scheduled to be filmed in spring 2009. Claudia Black is the only \"SG-1\" main cast member besides Corin Nemec (playing Jonas Quinn between \"SG-1\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> season 5 and 7) and Ben Browder (playing Cameron Mitchell from season 9 onward) who never appeared in \"Stargate Atlantis\", although Vala is mentioned by Rodney McKay (played by David Hewlett) in the \"Atlantis\" season 5 episode \"Identity\".\n\nClaudia Black made her entrance in \"Stargate SG-1\" in a full-body Kull Warrior costume, not dissimilar to her first appearance as a Peacekeeper in \"Farscape\". For her entrance in season 9's \"Avalon\", however, the costume designers intended her to wear a dress that the producers later deemed too revealing. Leaving the dress for Vala's appearance as Qetesh in \"The Powers That Be\", Vala's outfit for \"Avalon\" was switched to a black fetish leather gear which a costume designer described as \"a dominatrix outfit\". Black admitted the wildness of her \"Avalon\" wardrobe was not for her liking. But since it mirrored the attention-seeking personality of the character, and because the character does not spend much time in the same outfit anyway, the actress did not mind wearing it.\n\nVala started wearing the normal SG team uniform in \"Origin\", the third episode of season 9. Claudia Black was later included in the design process and was given full control over her wardrobe for scenes that required civilian clothes. As such, Black chose Vala's underwear for the seduction scene in \"The Ties That Bind\" and her shopping tour outfit in \"Family Ties\". The latter episode also showed Vala with seven distinctly different hairstyles and outfits in total. Fearing the lack of seriousness, the producers opposed the make-up department's decision of having Vala wear curlers, but the scene could not be reshot. Similarly, a scene showing Vala unpacking her hair dryer and curling iron during an offworld mission in \"The Quest\" was deemed too silly and was trimmed to the basics; it would have been cut if the footage had allowed it. Due to Black's pregnancy during the filming of the films, the costume department needed to hide Black's bump with appropriate dressing.\n\nThe character of Vala was immediately popular with the \"Stargate\" writers, producers and crew. During the filming of \"Prometheus Unbound\", people on set responded \"very well\" to the chemistry between Vala and Daniel. Director Andy Mikita called executive producer Robert C. Cooper during the first lunch break and told him to \"hire this gal\", and Cooper thought Vala/Black \"was absolutely wonderful. The character really worked out.\" Writer Damian Kindler \"really loved\" what Black brought to the show, believing that \"her character, when used properly, is just absolutely wonderful grist for the mill on SG-1.\" \"Stargate\" writer Martin Gero called Vala \"so much fun to write, almost too fun. You do kind of get carried away.\" Michael Shanks repeatedly stated in interviews that Claudia Black revitalized his interest in acting.\n\nWhile \"TV Guide\" called Vala a \"saucy [and] bodacious babe who immediately clicked with viewers\", \"GateWorld\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Darren Sumner and TheScifiWorld's Gilles Nuytens commented on her \"warm reception..by fans\" and her being \"an instant hit with fans of the show\". 71 percent of over 8000 \"GateWorld\" readers rated Claudia Black's portrayal of Vala in season 9 as \"perfect\". In a later \"GateWorld\" poll among over 12000 participants, 51 percent answered that Claudia Black's joining the main cast was \"about time!\", while 22 percent were concerned or had no opinion. The actress was not as confident about the character's reception, and Robert C. Cooper advertised Vala's last season 9 appearance as the return of \"a much loved and much hated character.\" Vala Mal Doran ranked second (25%) out of five behind \"SG-1\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Cameron Mitchell (27%) in the viewer-voted 2006 Spacey Awards for \"Favourite New TV Character\", and was voted third (22%) out of five places in the 2007 Spacey Awards for \"Favourite Character You Love to Hate\" (26% \"Battlestar Galactica\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Gaius Baltar, 28% \"Smallville\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Lex Luthor). Per popular demand, Diamond Select Toys included Vala in their third series of \"Stargate\" action figures.\n\n\"The Sun Herald\" thought of the character as \"a thoroughly charming intergalactic thief famed for using her allure to get what she wants\", and Matt Roush of TV Guide called Claudia Black \"great fun to watch in [seasons 8 and 9]\". \"TV Zone\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Stephen Graves believed that Browder and Black's first post-\"Farscape\" encounter in \"Stargate SG-1\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> \"Avalon\" was \"somewhat underplayed – but Black makes up for this with her sparky, snarky characterization of Vala.\" He welcomed the producers' decision to not cast a carbon copy of Samantha Carter, and thought that Claudia Black's Vala in her six-episode arc remained \"the best thing in the series\". By season 10's \"Memento Mori\", \"TV Zone\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Anthony Brown felt that \"Ben Browder and Claudia Black have...reached a point where they can play out an amusing take on \"Misery\" without you feeling that [their \"Farscape\" characters] have somehow starbursted onto \"SG-1\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Earth\". Maureen Ryan of \"The Chicago Tribune\" called Browder and Black's interaction in season 10 \"great fun; the rapport they developed on the stellar \"Farscape\" was still much in evidence, even though they played radically different characters on \"SG-1.\"\"\n\nMaureen Ryan described the chemistry between Black and Michael Shanks as \"sparky\" and \"one of the most diverting parts of the latter seasons of the show\". According to \"Ultimate DVD\", the scenes between Vala and Daniel as the object of her affection resulted in \"some of the freshest and funniest scenes in the show for some time\". In reviewing \"Unending\", Anthony Brown called Vala \"a character who's always had a little too much of comic relief [getting] torn apart by the nice guy of the team.\" SyFy Portal attributed \"Stargate SG-1\" not going stale after ten years to Black, as she \"quite literally steals the show from the existing cast of heroes\". For her portrayal of Vala, Claudia Black was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category \"Best Supporting Actress on Television\" in 2006, and won a Constellation Award in the category \"Best Female Performance in a 2006 Science Fiction Television\" for the episode \"Memento Mori\" in 2007.\n\n"}

Its method of game play is similar to another solitaire game Carpet.\n\nAll eight aces and one deuce (2 card) of each suit are separated for the shuffled deck of cards. Four aces (one for each suit) are placed in a row to form the Upper Aces. The remaining four aces are placed in a row below the Upper Aces to form the Lower Aces. Two deuces are placed at each side of the Aces. The formation of the Upper and Lower Aces and the Deuces should somewhat look like this:\nThen, sixteen cards are dealt below the formation in any convenient way possible. As a suggestion, they should form two rows of eight cards. They form the reserve.\n\nThe above formation above represents the foundations. The Upper Aces are built up by suit to Kings. The Lower Aces are built up by suit in twos; same goes for the Deuces. Therefore, the building order is as follows:\n\nThe sixteen cards in the reserve are available for only to the foundations; they are not for building. Any space left behind in the reserve is filled by a card from the wastepile or, if one has not been built yet, the stock.\n\nWhen no moves are possible from the reserve, the stock is dealt, one at a time to the wastepile. The top card is available to be played directly to the foundation or used to fill up gaps in the reserve. The stock can only be dealt once.\n\nThe game ends as soon as the stock runs out. The game is considered won when all cards end up in the foundations.\n"}

It harmonises the treatment of databases under copyright law and the\n\"sui generis\" right for the creators of databases which do not qualify for copyright.\n\nArticle 1(2) defines a database as \"a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic \nor methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means\". Non-electronic databases are also covered \n(para. 14 of the preamble). Any computer program used to create the database is not included (para. 23 of the \npreamble). Copyright protection of software is governed by Directive 91/250/EEC.\n\nUnder Article 3, databases which, \"by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents, constitute the author's own intellectual creation\" are protected by copyright as collections: no other criterion may be used by Member States. This follows from the 1994 Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), a widely adopted treaty to which all World Trade Organization members are party. TRIPS clarifies and arguably relaxes the criterion for protection of collections in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which covers \"collections of literary and artistic works\" and requires creativity in the \"selection \"and\" arrangement\" of the contents: in practice the difference is likely to be slight. Any copyright in the database is separate from and without prejudice to the copyright in the entries.\n\nThe acts restricted by copyright are similar to those for other types of work (Art. 5):\n\n\nThis shall not prevent the lawful use of the database by a lawful user [Art. 6(1)]: Member States may provide for any or \nall of the following limitations [Art. 6(2)], as well as applying any traditional limitations to copyright:\n\n\nCopyright protection usually lasts for seventy years after the death of the last publicly identified author. Anonymous or pseudonymous works gain protection for the later of 70 years after the work is lawfully made available to the public or 70 years from creation. If national legislation makes particular provision for collective works or for a legal person (i.e. a body corporate) to be a rights holder the term of protection of calculated in the same way as for anonymous or pseudonymous works, with the exception that if any natural persons who created the work are given credit in versions made available to the public, the term of protection is calculated according to the lives of those authors. Art. 1, Directive 93/98/EEC).\n\nCopyright protection is not available for databases which aim to be \"complete\", that is where the entries are selected by objective criteria: these are covered by \"sui generis\" database rights. While copyright protects the creativity of an author, database rights specifically protect the \"qualitatively and/or quantitatively [a] substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\": if there has not been substantial investment (which need not be financial), the database will not be protected [Art. 7(1)]. Database rights are held in the first instance by the person or corporation which made the substantial investment, so long as:\n\n\nArticle 11(3) provides for the negotiation of treaties to ensure reciprocal treatment outside the EU: as of 2006, no such treaty exists.\n\nThe holder of database rights may prohibit the extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part of the contents: the \"substantial part\" is evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively and reutilisation is subject to the exhaustion of rights. Public lending is not an act of extraction or re-utilization. The lawful user of a database which is available to the public may freely extract and/or re-use insubstantial parts of the database (Art. 8): the holder of database rights may not place restrictions of the purpose to which the insubstantial parts are used. However, users may not \"perform acts which conflict with normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the maker of the database\", nor prejudice any copyright in the entries. The same limitations may be provided to database rights as to \ncopyright in databases (Art. 9):\n\n\nDatabase rights last for fifteen years from the end of the year that the database was made available to the public, or from the end of the year of completion for private databases (Art. 10). Any substantial change which could be considered to be a substantial new investment will lead to a new term of database rights, which could, in principle, be perpetual. Database rights are independent of any copyright in the database, and the two could, in principle, be held by different people (especially in jurisdictions which prohibit the corporate ownership of copyright): as such, database rights can be compared to the rights of phonogram and film producers.\n\n\n\n"}

His \"historical review of the stage\", \"Roscius Anglicanus\" (1708), is an invaluable source for historians both of Restoration and of Stuart theater.\n\nDownes first enters the theatrical record in 1664, when he was registered by the Lord Chamberlain as a member of William Davenant's troupe under the patronage of the Duke of York. By his own admission, stage fright kept him from an acting career, although he is known to have played Haly in \"The Siege of Rhodes\". Later in the 1660s, he is recorded as a member of Thomas Betterton's King's Company; his main work seems to have been as prompter. He continued in this function when the two companies united in 1682; when the companies split in 1694, he remained with Betterton until the middle of the next decade. He is the subject of a number of the \"Tatler\"; in this letter from Downes (presumably written by Steele), gives a brief account of Downes's life. He retired around 1706, and may be the John Downes recorded as buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, in June 1712. \n\nDownes wrote his history of the Restoration stage between his retirement and death. It was published in 1708, and has served as a valuable resource ever since. Unlike earlier historians of English theater, such as Gerard Langbaine and James Wright, Downes approached the topic as an experienced insider; his concerns are those of a practical person of business, and he provides information that would otherwise be lost, particularly in the details of theatrical practice. He provides cast lists for countless plays, information on the success or failure of many pieces, and incidental comments on his own preferences. His accuracy is sometimes open to question, particularly as regards casting for often-staged plays. Still, as Sidney Lee notes, his work along with two or three other memoirs, \"is practically all to which we have to trust for our knowledge of the Restoration stage.\"\n"}

Psychological punishments that are particularly cruel or severe may be considered psychological torture.\n\nVery common is the use of shame through private or, especially, public humiliation. Other forms use may include isolating the one being punished or causing them to feel any type of psychological deprivation. \n\nFor example, publicly shaving a woman's head may not only humiliate her in front of those who witness her shearing, it may also deprive her of her hair for as long as it takes to grow back, thus serving as a continual reminder of her punishment and her humiliation.\n\n"}

He learned how to program to write his own software on the university mainframe and eventually began writing games. This translated into a job in the computer industry as a game designer and programmer. His early work includes \"Parthian Kings\" for Avalon Hill. After Robert Woodhead left the \"Wizardry\" video game series, Bradley co-designed \"\" (1988) with Andrew C. Greenberg. The design was based on a game that Bradley had already written several years prior, but it was rebranded and rewritten as a \"Wizardry\" sequel. Though recommended by contemporary game reviewers, Matt Barton wrote in \"Dungeons and Desktops\" that the game was not a significant departure from the previous titles, which were still using game design based on the 1981 original title. This was followed by \"\" (1990) and \"\" (1992), which formed the beginning of a new trilogy and were solely designed by Bradley. Both games were well received by critics, and the latter was praised for its design. During the development of the seventh game, Bradley was named in a lawsuit filed by Woodhead and Greenberg against Sir-Tech over royalties. Bradley said that he was uninvolved in the dispute, and, following a falling-out with Sir-Tech, left the company. He subsequently designed the action game \"CyberMage\" (1995) for Origin Systems.

{"id": "2304755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304755", "title": "Set screw", "text": "Set screw\n\nA set screw, also known as a blind screw or a grub screw, is a type of screw generally used to secure an object within or against another object, usually without using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless, meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the thread's major diameter. If a set screw does have a head, the thread will extend all the way to the head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A set screw is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or a slot. The set screw passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.\n\nAn example application is when a set screw is screwed into a pulley hub so that its end-point bears firmly against the shaft. The fastening action is by friction between the screw and the shaft, often (but not always) with some amount of elastic or plastic deformation of one or both.\n\nSet screw or setscrew in the UK refers to a bolt which is fully threaded, with no smooth shank. These commonly have a hex head, but are also found with socket or screw heads. This contrasts with usage in the US where a set screw is almost universally a grub screw or small-headed bolt. A fully threaded bolt is commonly called a cap screw in the US.\n\nSet screws are not always the best way to resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of slipping and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a \"flat\") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set screw's point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as they make the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the screw. Set screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large set screws holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set screws without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.\n\nFor longer life, set screws are usually made of alloy steel and case hardened. Hardened set screws often leave a plastic deformation, in the form of a circular or semicircular mark, in the shaft that the screw sets against. This has both pros and cons. On the pro side, such deformation increases the holding power (torque resistance) of the joint, as the screw is essentially \"making its own detent\" on a small but effective scale. On the con side, if one is aiming to have a blemish-free cosmetic finish on the part being set against, one must take actions to prevent the circular marks. In most set screw applications, this consideration is irrelevant. Another con is that this plastic deformation can cause corresponding high points in the shaft surrounding the circular mark. This can result in difficulties during dis-assembly if a bearing or other tightly toleranced part needs to slide past this area. Use of a flat mitigates this problem.\n\nSet screws appear with a variety of tip (point) types. The different shaped tips have different properties that engineers can utilize. If an engineer were to use a detent to ensure proper nesting of the screw, they might choose to use a cone point type of screw. One might often need to use a flat point when the screw must press perfectly flat against a surface. The most common type is the cup point. This type works well because the surface is rounded so that a small surface area is in contact, but it does not have extremely high stress at one point like that of a cone point. Durability studies show that the cup point offers superior resistance to wear while maintaining a strong grip. Knurled cup points offer the added advantage of a locking action (similar to that of a serrated lock washer) that prevents the screws from working loose in high-vibration applications.\n\nCommon points include the following:\n\nKnurl point screws are generally used to secure one object within another. The serrated ridge on the knurl cup set screw helps reduce loosening due to vibration. The knurled point combines digging action of the cup point with counter-clockwise locking knurls that have a ratchet-locking action which helps resist loosening, even under the most severe vibrations.\n\nKnurl point set screws should not be reused because the cutting edges of the knurls are deflected when tightened. During removal, the cutting edges are torn and no longer have full strength to resist unscrewing. ISO standard for Knurled cup point set screw is ISO 4029.\n\nSet screws are made with a variety of drive styles, including the following:\n\nThe concept of set screws is centuries old, predating the metal screw by at least several hundred years. Early materials included wood, bone, horn, antler and ivory.\n\nHeadless set screws have been around for a long time, with the straight slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan \"safety first\", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex socket drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was ubiquitous in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The \"safety craze\" created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex socket drive.\n\n\nFastenere\n\n"}

He was partnered with professional dancer Nadiya Bychkova and was the second contestant to be eliminated on 7 October 2018. In 2019, Ryan starred in Celebs go dating and released his first single after nine years called Ghost.\n\nLee Ryan was born in Chatham, Kent. His parents split up when he was six years old. Ryan mostly lived with his mother, sister Gemma and his grandmother. Ryan went to Bedonwell School before attending performing arts schools, including Welling School and the Independent Performing Arts School Belcanto London Academy (BLA), where he first developed his talent, then independent fee-paying theatre schools Sylvia Young Theatre School and Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts.\n\nRyan is a member of boy band Blue along with Simon Webbe, Duncan James and Antony Costa. The group has sold over 14 million records worldwide. In August 2005, Blue split up to pursue solo careers under the advice of Sir Elton John. Blue reformed on 28 April 2009.\n\nRyan has had three number one hits while with Blue. He had previously co-directed the video for Blue's single \"Breathe Easy\", which he also wrote and which was shot in Prague. In 2001 the group were in New York during the September 11 attacks after which Ryan commented that \"This New York thing is being blown out of proportion\" and asked \"What about whales? They are ignoring animals that are more important. Animals need saving and that's more important.\" The other members of the group tried to silence Ryan, but he went on. This caused a huge media backlash that resulted in Blue losing a record deal in the United States and campaigns to sack Ryan from the line up. In August 2003 Ryan was arrested and charged with driving with excess alcohol in central London. In May 2004 Ryan was cleared of assaulting two photographers who had attempted to take photos of him leaving a nightclub however he was convicted of criminal damage for smashing their cameras.\n\nRyan released his first single \"Army of Lovers\" on 18 July 2005. It debuted at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart and hit No. 1 in Italy. On 1 August 2005, Ryan released his debut album, \"Lee Ryan\", to mixed reviews. The album reached No. 6 in the UK Album Chart and No. 3 in Italy. \"Turn Your Car Around\" was the second single lifted from the album which had moderate success. In January 2006, Ryan released his third and final single in the UK \"When I Think of You\". The song reached No. 15 in the UK. \"Real Love\" was used for the end credits of the film \"\" which later led to Ryan voicing the part of an elk in the UK version of the film and Eddie in the Italian version. In late 2005, Dolce & Gabbana signed Ryan up to be the UK face of their new line of clothing.\n\nAfter the relative success of his first solo album, Ryan started planning his second solo album. The single \"Reinforce Love\" was released on 10 December 2007. The single was being released for Great Ormond Street Hospital and CLIC Sargent, which were the two charities that Ryan was touring for in November and December 2007, with young voices. The album was then postponed, and finally cancelled. He appeared in the video for the latest single by a British girlband named Fe-Nix. In September 2007, he appeared as one of the contestants in \"Hell's Kitchen\". However he rowed with Marco Pierre White about White's use of the term \"\", and subsequently left the show. In August and September 2008, Ryan acted alongside Natalie Casey in \"The Pretender Agenda\" at The New Players Theatre in London. In June 2008 Ryan was found guilty of assaulting a taxi driver in Oxted and ordered to pay compensation to the victim.\n\nIn March 2010, Ryan confirmed that he had signed a new record deal with Geffen Records, due to last until 2013. Later that month, it was announced that Ryan's first album on his new record label, \"Confessions\", was due to be released in October 2010. The first single from the album, \"Secret Love\", was released as a double A-Side with \"I Am Who I Am\" on 4 July 2010. The single peaked at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. Following this, it was announced that Geffen were set to drop Ryan from the label, before work on his album had been completed. Ryan announced in January 2011 that there was no deal to release his album.\n\nThe track listing for Ryan's aborted album was as follows: \"Secret Love\", \"I Am Who I Am\", \"Guardian Angel\", \"Perfect Strangers\", \"I Don't Wanna Let You Down\", \"I Love Your Smile\", \"It's Not Me\", \"Confessions\", \"Light of Your Soul\", \"Peaches\", \"Reinforce Love\", \"Suffice to Say\", \"To See the Stars\", \"Stop the Rain\", \"Why Me\" and \"Stand Up as People\".

She is played by actress Marcia Cross, who has received multiple awards and nominations for her portrayal, including an Emmy Award nomination, three Golden Globe Award nominations, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Cross' portrayal of Bree has been widely praised by critics and fans.\n\nCross originally auditioned for the role of Mary Alice Young, but series creator Marc Cherry thought she was better suited for the role of Bree. Dana Delany, who eventually was cast as Katherine Mayfair, was originally chosen for the role but turned it down, saying it was too similar to her role in \"Pasadena\".\n\nBree's main struggle throughout the series has been her attempts to maintain a perfect life despite various obstacles such as widowhood, divorce, and alcoholism hindering her. She has been married three times; to Rex Van de Kamp (Steven Culp), Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), and Trip Weston (Scott Bakula).\n\nBree Van de Kamp is one of the four main protagonists in \"Desperate Housewives\". Bree grew up in Rhode Island when her father married a woman named Eleanor, after her mother's death, with whom she did not get along. In order to escape her stepmother's demands, Bree left for Lake Forest College near Chicago. Bree also mentioned on one of Eleanor's visits that she had to work for every kind word she ever was given from her step-mother. Bree met Rex Van de Kamp at a meeting of the Young Republicans. After they graduated, they married and had two children, Andrew and Danielle, and moved to Fairview.\n\nBree is very much written as an exaggerated version of the characteristics often attributed to White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Americans; she has been called a \"hyper-uptight WASP.\" Bree is recognized for her perfectionist attitude and work ethic, which at times border on neurosis and obsessive–compulsive disorder. While the writers have shied away from an official diagnosis, the character is recognized as suffering from obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. The character herself refers to her \"quirks\" in terms of anal retentiveness but Rex once mentioned it by the name. Bree's perfectionism may stem from when her mother was killed in a hit and run: a 10-year-old Bree cleaned her blood off the road outside the house. She said that once everything was spotless, she felt much better.\n\nBree is known for her homemaking talents on the level of Martha Stewart, particularly her gourmet meals, breakfast treats and pineapple bran muffins. She is also well versed in firearms; she owns four guns and is a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association. Bree supports the Republican Party, as stated in the season 3 opener, and is also known for being a member of the local Presbyterian church, as shown in the episode \"Sunday\". Her neighbors Angie Bolen, Gabrielle Solis and Renee Perry have nicknamed her 'Nancy Reagan' on occasions.\n\nShe has lived at 4354 Wisteria Lane in Fairview since 1994 and is also said to have a timeshare residence in Aspen that she never uses.\nBree is based on creator Marc Cherry's own mother, and the Van de Kamp family is based on the family in which he grew up. Bree's family was based on Marc Cherry's teen years, while Lynette Scavo's family is based on Marc Cherry's childhood years. Bree and her first husband, Rex, were both named after the overtly vain characters on two of Marc Cherry's previous failed sitcoms, \"The 5 Mrs. Buchanans\" (Bree) and \"The Crew\" (Rex).\n\nBoth of Bree's marriages have broken down and ended in divorce (Rex, however, died before their divorce was finalized). Following the request for divorce, both of Bree's former husbands attempted reconciliation with her. Rex succeeded, whereas her second husband Orson Hodge did not. During the breakdown of her second marriage, Bree had an affair with Karl Mayer, her divorce lawyer and ex-husband of her friend, Susan Delfino. Bree, however, did remarry in the series finale to her lawyer, Trip Weston, making him her third husband.\n\nBree is the only one of the main four housewives not to appear in every episode. Appearing only as a stand-in in \"My Husband, The Pig\", Bree is totally absent in its six following episodes (\"Dress Big\", \"Liaisons\", \"God, That's Good\", \"Gossip\", \"Into the Woods\" and \"What Would We Do Without You?\") due to Cross' pregnancy.\n\nBree Mason was born in the year 1962. When she was 10 years old, her mother taught her a lesson about \"masking\" so she could hide true feelings and emotions, which prevented her from being able to be hurt by men. Shortly after, during Christmas 1972, her mother died in hospital after a car accident. Bree stayed at home and cleaned her mother's blood from the driveway. She felt relieved after that. Her father then married Eleanor. Bree had to earn respect from her stepmother and so worked very hard. Eleanor said to her stepdaughter that she was very lucky and possessed beauty, wit, cunning and insight: weapons all women needed to survive in the world. Her dad took care of his daughter and tried to raise her to be a classic lady.\n\nShe got engaged to her boyfirend, Ty Grant, but met Rex Van de Kamp and the two fell in love during college. Bree and Rex got married in 1987. Bree gave birth to her son Andrew in 1988 and daughter Danielle in 1989. The family moved in 1994 to 4354 Wisteria Lane, Fairview. She gave a bad first impression to Mary Alice Young and Susan Mayer, local neighbours and friends, after Andrew stole a ceramic frog from the Youngs' backyard. Bree, Susan and Mary Alice become close friends. In 1998 Lynette Scavo joined the group. 5 years later, after a short and difficult first impression of Gabrielle Solis, all four women accepted the ex-model as their friend.\n\nBree Van de Kamp is introduced as the \"perfect\" wife and mother. However, it becomes apparent that her emotional coldness and obsession with appearances makes her family resent her, and as her husband Rex put it \"I just can't live in this detergent commercial anymore\".\n\nShe insists she and Rex have marriage guidance counseling when he wants a divorce, and demands that Andrew and Danielle refuse presents from their father if they want to continue living with her. Unfortunately, in Andrew's case, this leads to him drink-driving and accidentally knocking down Juanita Solis, leaving her seriously injured. Rex and Bree conceal this to protect him but Bree is soon disappointed with his lack of remorse. Determined to make him realize that there are consequences to his actions, she reveals, in an anonymous tip-off to the coach of the swimming team, that Andrew keeps marijuana in his locker. This discovery results in him being removed from the team. Bree is determined to keep her family together until Rex has a heart attack, leading her to discover that he regularly visited a prostitute. Worse still, the prostitute turns out to be an acquaintance of hers, Maisy Gibbons, who is later arrested for living off immoral earnings. Maisy is persuaded to do a deal with the District Attorney, naming her clients and despite a request from Bree, does not remove Rex's name. Furious, Bree tells Rex she will divorce him but is \"persuaded\" by Andrew and Danielle to look after him, while he recuperates from a heart attack. Initially wanting to hurt him, Bree starts dating local pharmacist, George Williams, but ends things when Rex asks her to give their marriage another chance. She and George agree to be just friends. Wanting to stop Rex visiting prostitutes, she reluctantly takes part in S&M scenarios with him.\n\nConcerned about Andrew's worsening behavior, she is cheered when Rex backs her up on one occasion. Unfortunately this doesn't make any difference so Rex and Bree feel that they have no choice but to send Andrew away to a boot camp. While there, Andrew reveals to his parents that he is gay. Bree initially tells him that she will always love him regardless but quietly insists to Rex that they take Andrew home immediately, worried about what he might be doing with the other boys at night, and asks their vicar to give Andrew some counseling on lifestyle, believing that his soul is in danger. This has disastrous results, as Andrew thinks she doesn't love him and deliberately hurts her. Bree continues to confide in George about her family problems but, after Rex makes it clear that Bree will stay with him, George begins tampering with Rex's medication. This is uncovered when Rex has a second heart attack. Believing Bree was responsible, Rex writes a note forgiving her and dies. Bree's final scenes in the season involve her receiving the bad news and breaking down in tears.\n\nIn Season 2, Bree's mother-in-law, Phyllis (Shirley Knight), visits for her son's funeral. She so annoys Bree with her constant sniping and excessive displays of grief that Bree tells her that she cannot attend Rex's funeral, but Andrew persuades her to. The final straw, however, is when she discovers Phyllis reported her friendship with George to the company handling Rex's life insurance. Bree sends Phyllis home and is questioned by the police about meddling with Rex's medication. She is cleared and is furious when she discovers the note Rex had left her which claimed he thought she murdered him and she starts dating George. However, George constantly tries to rush things, making her uneasy. When George places an announcement of their engagement in the local paper, an ex-fiancée of his visits Bree to warn her about him. Bree is horrified and sends the woman away but she is proved right when George loses his temper with an old school friend of Bree's, so she ends their relationship. He tries blackmailing her into a reconciliation by taking some pills and admits killing Rex. Devastated, Bree says that she has called an ambulance and it will be there soon, but in reality, she hasn't. She watches him die and tells Andrew, who tries blackmailing her for his trust fund.\nEvents with Rex, George and Andrew take their toll and she starts drinking heavily. She realizes she has a problem when she loses Lynette's children after passing out while babysitting. Andrew later begins making accusations about Bree physically abusing him and tries to seek emancipation rights, which Bree refuses. In denial, but not wanting Andrew to get his trust fund or give up on him, Bree joins AA but only takes it seriously after passing out in a shop changing room and not waking up until late at night. Her AA sponsor, Peter, and a security guard let her out. Bree also faces more turmoil when she discovers her new neighbors, the Applewhites are hiding from the police and is blackmailed into silence. To distract herself from her alcoholism, she has a brief relationship with Peter, who is addicted to sex. However, Andrew discovers this and seduces Peter to get revenge on Bree for denying him his trust fund. She dumps Peter and throws Andrew out after discovering that they slept together and in her bed.\n\nBree's mental health deteriorates rapidly following this and nobody can help her as her behavior becomes erratic and spirals out of control including creating a scene at Danielle's birthday party. Danielle, meanwhile, starts dating Matthew Applewhite and moves out to be with him. However, Matthew's mother, Betty Applewhite, realizes Matthew murdered an ex-girlfriend, Melanie Foster. She tells Bree, who has checked herself into a psychiatric unit and later escapes after they refuse to let her leave. Bree and Betty rush to Bree's house to find Matthew and Danielle have taken money from Bree's safe. Bree confronts Matthew about Melanie and refuses to let them leave, so he threatens to shoot her, but the police, called by Betty, shoot him first. Bree then has to console Danielle. Bree's final scenes involve her beginning a new friendship with the mysterious Orson Hodge.\n\nSeason three sees Bree marrying Orson after a six-month relationship, but their marriage is troubled by the belief that Orson physically abused his first wife, Alma (Valerie Mahaffey), and murdered her. Shortly after the wedding, Orson persuades Andrew to come home and they reconcile.\n\nHowever, the arrival of Orson's mother, Gloria (Dixie Carter), and Alma's return, cause more trouble. They drug and rape Orson but Bree intervenes, learning that Gloria murdered Orson's mistress, Monique Polier, so he would stay with Alma. Gloria tries to kill Bree but Orson intervenes. Gloria has a severe stroke after Orson holds her head under water to get her to let go of the knife about to be used to kill Bree. Orson carries Gloria's body outside and places it next to Alma's body after she died when falling from the roof of her house.\n\nDanielle, meanwhile, finds herself pregnant by Edie's nephew Austin (Josh Henderson). She is sent away so the neighborhood won't learn of her pregnancy and Bree and Orson decide to fake a pregnancy so they can raise Danielle's child as their own.\n\nBree is not in episodes 3.16 to 3.22 as she is on honeymoon with Orson and Danielle. Bree returns for Gabrielle and Victor's wedding, heavily pregnant or so it seems...\n\nIn season four, Bree and Orson struggle to make people think she is pregnant but is dismayed by people wanting to feel the baby move. Phyllis, Rex's mother, discovers Bree's pregnancy hoax and tries convincing Danielle to raise the child herself. Bree and Orson, however, persuade Danielle to give them the baby by offering to send her to college and buy her a convertible. Danielle has a baby boy and gives him to Bree — who names him Benjamin Tyson Hodge (surname later changed to Katz) — and agrees that Bree and Orson will raise him.\n\nBree develops a rivalry with new neighbor, Katherine Mayfair. Bree and Katherine are very similar, leading to a series of feuds before eventually becoming friends and go into business together, catering dinner parties.\n\nAfter a tornado damages Bree's house, she, Orson and Benjamin stay with Susan, and Orson admits being responsible for putting Mike in a coma. Horrified, Bree kicks him out. During their separation, Edie Britt comes onto Orson, leading to a feud between her and Bree. Edie discovers Benjamin is Bree's grandson and attempts to blackmail her. Bree, however, tells the other housewives the truth, so they all snub Edie.\n\nIn the season finale, Katherine saves Bree's life by telling her ex-husband, Wayne, her secrets. When Katherine kills Wayne, Bree and the other housewives tell the police that Katherine was terrified of a stalker so she doesn't go to prison.\n\nWhen the events of the series shift ahead by five years in the fourth-season finale, it is revealed that Bree is now a famous cookbook author and her son, Andrew, works with her as her assistant. Bree and Orson have evidently worked out their problems and are still together.\n\nThe fifth season opens with Bree just having published her own cookbook, and successfully running the catering business. She and Orson reconcile after he went to prison for running over Mike. A flashback sequence reveals that while Bree awaited Orson's release, Danielle returned and took Benjamin, leaving her completely alone. Devastated, Bree relapsed into alcoholism but overcame it, thanks to Katherine.\n\nBree puts her career first, alienating her friends at times and causing a rift between her and Orson. In revenge, Orson begins stealing - initially to punish people who he feels have been rude, and to hurt Bree. Orson agrees to stop stealing, but when Bree learns that he was injured while attempting to rob an old woman (which led to Edie Britt's death) and that he has been trying to convince people that the old woman is senile, she decides she has had enough. She hires Karl Mayer as her divorce lawyer, who convinces her to stage a fake burglary so she can hide her precious/expensive things in a storage unit and not risk losing them in the divorce proceedings. However, Orson discovers her plan, threatening to send her to prison for insurance fraud unless she stays with him. Bree agrees reluctantly but shares a passionate kiss with Karl.\n\nIn the first episode, Bree is unwilling to sleep with Karl, despite her marriage being strained. Orson, however, is determined to salvage their relationship, commenting that guilt is sometimes necessary for happiness, and defending his use of blackmail so that she'll stay with him. Bree takes this motto as her own and consummates her affair with Karl.\n\nWhen Julie is hospitalized after being attacked, Bree worries that she will lose Susan's friendship on hearing that Susan would hypothetically no longer talk to a friend who dated Karl. However, Karl's fragility convinces Bree he needs her and she begins falling for him, acknowledging her feelings when they attend the same event and Karl brings another woman. This distracts her from her business and only realizes the extent of Katherine's instability when an event is ruined. Bree dismisses her and, after getting to know new neighbor, Angie Bolen, hires her instead. Meanwhile, Karl's romantic gestures make their affair harder to hide. Suspicious, Orson gets Angie to spy on Bree. She discovers the tryst but confronts Bree, who explains that she connects intellectually with Orson but sexually with Karl, and is worried that their relationship will only ever be physical, despite his promises to change.\n\nBree's fears are realized when Susan also finds out about her and Karl. They fight, but despite her initial unhappiness, Susan eventually gives them her blessing. In order to get away from Orson, Karl suggests Bree threaten him, which she does, indicating she has evidence of him breaking his parole, and demands a divorce. Stunned, Orson tells Bree that he wouldn't send her to prison for fraud and goes to pack, but discovers her affair with Karl. They fight and Bree tries intervening but when an airplane crashes into Wisteria Lane, Karl is killed and Orson is paralyzed. Feeling guilty, Bree insists Orson come home so she can look after him but he is disgusted by her infidelity and takes advantage. Angry about his lack of manners and personal hygiene, Bree hoses him down but stops when he explains how angry he is with the way his life is now. Wanting to help, Bree gets two disabled men to visit, but Orson asks her to let him kill himself, telling her that he wants to die because no one loves him. When asked, \nBree can't say the words, but seeing Orson trying to drown himself at a party of an old married couple with such passion causes Bree to realize that she still wants things to work with Orson. She stops him by telling him how much she cares and wants to recapture what they once had, and they reconcile.\n\nA young man named Sam Allen visits Bree, offering himself as a new assistant. Impressed by Sam's skills, Bree promotes him to vice-president, much to Andrew's anger. While visiting Sam's home, Bree is stunned to see a photo of Rex and Sam. Sam admits Rex was his father and that he spent years watching Bree's family, wondering why Rex chose them over him, and after his mother's death, came to see Bree. Shocked by this, Bree welcomes Sam into her life but finds herself at odds with Andrew, who suspects Sam has an ulterior motive. Sam plots to make Bree fire Andrew, which she does, but after she reveals that she and Andrew have a love-and-hate relationship, it's likely that Andrew will return. After she tells Orson about a sabotaged dinner, suspecting Andrew, Orson says Andrew couldn't be responsible because it was well planned, making Bree suspect Sam's true intentions. She discovers that Sam's mother is still alive and reveals that Sam found a letter from Rex, offering to take full custody of him. Bree confronts Sam about his lies and he angrily smashes a vase before leaving. She apologizes to Andrew but tells him and Orson she's not firing Sam for fear of how he might react.\n\nIn the season finale, Bree does try firing Sam but he retaliates by revealing he knows how Andrew ran over Carlos' mother years before (a drunken Danielle told him). He threatens to tell the police unless Bree turns over control of the company to him. Bree agrees to do so and then says she feels sorry for Sam for losing his chance to be part of a family and suspects no one will ever truly care for the man. Orson, who had not known what Andrew did, calls out Bree on the hypocrisy of demanding he go to jail for his hit-and-run of Mike but hiding Andrew's crime. He is both appalled and furious at Bree for this and announces he's moving out. Bree tells Andrew she now knows Orson was right and is seen about to confess to Gabrielle.\n\nBree confesses to covering up the demise of Carlos' mom Mama Solis (Lupe Ontiveros). Gabrielle chooses not to tell her husband. After discovering her ex-husband has a new girlfriend only a week after they separated, Bree decides to redecorate the ground floor of her house, hiring Keith Watson (Brian Austin Green), to help but finds herself attracted to him. While looking at him from her car, she does not see Juanita Solis (Madison De La Garza) behind her before reversing, leading to Juanita being admitted to hospital. Upon finding out that Keith has a girlfriend, she agreed to go out clubbing with Renee Perry. She finds out that Keith broke up with his girlfriend, but he is instead going home with Renee. Bree sabotages their night and eventually asks Keith on a date. This begins Bree and Renee's fight over Keith.\n\nLater Bree only mentioned to Richard Watson, father of Keith, that she's finally a divorcee. Learning this, Richard, who has been having feelings for Bree, tries to make a move to destroy Bree's and Keith's relationship so that he could have Bree instead. Keith attempts to propose to Bree and after the second failed attempt, Keith begins to question his relationship with Bree. Richard manipulates Keith's mind by warning him that Bree might be using him as a diversion from her actual feelings after her divorce from Orson. As a result, Keith begins to avoid Bree. Richard then kisses Bree all of a sudden and after he leaves, Bree tells Keith everything about his father's attempts to tear them apart. Later, Keith confronts Richard about this and has a fistfight with him but when rioters, who are opposing Paul Young's plan to open a halfway house for ex-convicts on Wisteria Lane, see the two fight, they mistaken him as an ex-convict due to his tattoos and ex-convict-like clothing and begin to beat Keith up. Bree breaks up the fight by firing a gun into the sky and this triggers fear and panic among the rioters and supporters for the halfway house alike, thinking this is an assassination attempt, proceed to flee, resulting in a riot that goes out of control.\n\nBree is thrown when Orson returns, claiming he was dumped by his girlfriend. Keith is annoyed at how Bree is willing to let Orson stay with them. Over dinner, Orson makes it clear he doesn't think Keith is a good choice for Bree as they have nothing in common and Orson understands her more, the two throwing food at one another. Bree goes to see Orson's ex, who reveals that Orson was the one who broke up with her as he's still in love with Bree. She confronts him and Orson confesses how he feels and thinks Bree is too good for Keith. Keith is angered at Bree continuing to want Orson to stay with them, saying that she's still in love with Orson. Bree responds by shoving him down in her manure-covered lawn, getting herself dirty to prove how much she's changed. When one of Keith's old girlfriends comes by, Bree is suspicious and discovers the woman has been raising Keith's son. She mentions children to Keith, who seems unsure whether he is father material. Bree goes to the girlfriend, lying about how Keith doesn't want to know the child. Keith finds her cutting up her roses as she says \"you have to be ruthless to protect what you want.\" Bree meets the woman later to lend her money and when she leaves her son in Bree's care, Keith drops by the pizza parlor. Seeing Keith and the boy instantly bonding, Bree is overcome with guilt and confesses to Keith that the boy is actually his son. Keith desperately wants to be with his son, but he doesn't want to leave Bree, he pitches the idea of moving to Florida with Bree but she refuses to leave her home and friends. The next day Bree makes the ultimate decision and tells Keith that he must go to Florida for his son. She sacrifices their relationship and Keith leaves.\n\nBree discovers that Andrew has started drinking again, so much so that his husband leaves him. She encourages Andrew to go into rehab but is jarred when he decides to make amends by telling Carlos about running over his mother. When Carlos invites Andrew on a camping trip, Bree and Gabrielle fear the worst and follow them. Seeing Carlos with a bloody towel and a dirty shovel, Bree blurts out what Andrew did, just before her son enters the cabin. Carlos is outraged over this but eventually forgives Andrew. However, when Bree comes to thank him for not pressing charges, Carlos coldly tells her he won't forgive her for hiding the truth all these years and that they're no longer friends and that she and Gabby can no longer be friends. Bree ends up taking Gabby and her daughters into her house when Gabby leaves Carlos after telling him that she will not end her friendship with Bree. While the Solis' are staying with Bree she has a run in with Detective Chuck Vance (Jonathan Cake) who was on Wisteria Lane to check on parolee Felicia Tillman. Juanita Solis calls the police and tells them that Bree is trying to kill her and Celia (after Carlos tells her Bree's involvement in her grandmother's death). Chuck responds to the call at Bree's home and Carlos sorts everything out, explaining that the girls misunderstood what he had told them. Chuck leaves and gives Bree his number and the Solis' move out of Bree's and back with Carlos.\n\nChuck later returns to give Bree his number again after assuming she'd lost it since he hasn't received a call from her. Bree then agrees to go out on a date with him that night and when Bree tells this to Renee, Renee runs a background check on Chuck and reveals to Bree that he's still married (though he had filed for divorce a year ago). At dinner, Bree confronts Chuck with this information but Chuck retaliates by telling her that he had also run a background check on her, therefore becoming more aware of Bree's past. Offended, Bree abruptly ends their date and as Chuck drives her home, Chuck catches a hooker in the street and brings her back to the women's center. There, Chuck tells the hooker (who believes that she'll be a hooker forever) that she can turn her life around, pretending to reveal that Bree once was a prostitute and she had turned over a new leaf by going to school and starting a massive catering company. Moved by Chuck's sincere words, Bree gives Chuck a second chance and the two agree to go out on another date afterwards.\n\nDuring the \"progressive dinner party\" celebrating Susan's return to Wisteria Lane, Bree (along with Lynette and Susan) walks into Gaby's house to discover that Carlos has murdered Alejandro Perez, Gaby's stepfather. She spearheads the decision to cover up the murder to protect Carlos, thus earning his forgiveness for keeping the secret about his mother's hit-and-run for all those years.\n\nFollowing their agreement to cover up the murder of Alejandro, Bree's relationship with Chuck begins to suffer. She finds herself constantly paranoid that he will discover her involvement, and uses sex as a way to distract him. She then receives a note exactly like the one Mary Alice received when she shot herself. She then seeks out the counsel of Paul Young, asking if he was the one who sent it. Upset over the fact that Bree may still judge him for his past he sends her away. However, he later calls her back urging her to tell the other housewives to spare her Mary Alice's fate, and reveals to her the only other person who he told about the note to was the cop who was looking into Martha Huber's death, Chuck. At first suspicious, Bree decides to break up with Chuck when he tries to propose. He does not take it well, telling her she is making a big mistake. Danielle returns, having been dumped by her husband and Bree is at first supportive until she finds her daughter is now selling adult swings to make money.\n\nHaving avoided church over her guilt in hiding Alejandro, Bree is convinced to help Ben Faulkner in a soup kitchen. When a passing college student raves over her cooking, the kitchen is soon home to regular people, not the homeless and Bree realizes that's wrong. She tells everyone to leave, giving a speech on how this is meant to help the less fortunate. Ben is impressed and has Bree give a speech to the city council to convince them to let Ben build a homeless shelter in Fairview. At first happy about helping, Bree is horrified to realize the spot Ben is about to break ground on is where the girls buried Alejandro. She, Gabrielle and Lynette go to dig the body back up only to find it gone. It turns out Ben found it earlier, thinking he was just a drifter and Bree convinces him to help keep it quiet. However, Bree soon finds Chuck is suspicious and putting together clues to prove what the girls did. The pressure soon drives Bree to break her sobriety and pour herself a drink.\n\nChuck starts to dig deeper into Gabrielle's stepfather's disappearance. Gabrielle tells Bree that Chuck brought them in for questioning and Bree snaps, causing her to head to a motel. When she arrives she sits at a table in her room, pulls out a bottle of wine and a gun, and begins talking to the spirit of Mary Alice. Bree asks her asking if she is happy after having killed herself who replies, \"I'm not unhappy\". Bree is ready to kill herself when Renee kicks in the door, mistakenly believing Bree is with Ben. After yelling, threatening to hit her and telling her she's \"nothing more than a skank in a Nancy Reagan nightie\", Renee notices the gun and the note. After reading it she takes Bree home and stays there to make sure she's okay. When Renee says she won't let a friend die, Bree points out they're not quite friends, hurting Renee. She confesses to Bree how her own mother committed suicide and makes Bree see it's not the way out. Bree is happy at first, more so when she hears Chuck was killed in a hit-and-run. However, when she opens her mailbox, she finds a note saying \"You're welcome.\"\n\nRenee takes Bree to a bar, encouraging her to live a little and Bree ends up going with a man, skinny-dipping in a pool before the owner of the house comes home. Bree soon is going to bed with a succession of men which gets the Reverend concerned about her behavior. Determined to show he's wrong, Bree comes to the bake sale where she meets one of her lovers, only to discover he's married. When Karen McCluskey says that they do not know what Bree is really like, Bree decides to live up her reputation as the new town slut. Bree is soon bed-hopping to the point where she hits upon a man in a bar without remembering she had gone home with him just two nights previously. When they hear about Renee taking Bree to a bar, her friends try and stage an intervention at which point Bree reaches boiling point and blasts them for their less than friend like behavior recently. At the bar, she's approached by a man and realizes how far she's fallen, ready to go home. The man follows her to the parking lot, threatening to assault Bree only to be interrupted by a wheelchair-bound Orson. He uses a taser to knock the man out, telling Bree her friends called him to help and if there's one thing they did well together, it was \"cleaning up each other's messes.\" Orson soon convinces Bree that the girls are still angry at her and to go away with him for a weekend. What Bree doesn't know is that Orson has been stalking her for months, seeing the girls bury Alejandro's body and he was the one leaving Bree the notes as part of his warped scheme to win her back. Bree soon discovers the truth while visiting Orson's apartment and despite his claims he did it all for her, she says she wants nothing to do with him. Orson calls her later, claiming that their love requires sacrifice and Bree believes he's going to kill himself. Instead, Orson mails a folder of evidence to the Fairview Police.\n\nBree is surprised when Andrew comes home, engaged to a woman named Mary Beth. Learning she's an heiress, Bree suspects Andrew is just marrying her for her money. Mary Beth tells Bree she knows Andrew is gay but is still willing to marry him as she's been unlucky in love. Bree convinces Mary Beth to find a man who truly loves her and she breaks up with Andrew. Andrew is upset at losing a chance at the money but Bree tells him he can stay with her and accept her help getting back on his feet.\n\nMeanwhile, the police become suspicious of Bree and the murder of Gaby's stepfather and the help of his cover-up, so they tread carefully in trying to get proof that she is one of the suspects. They interview her, and she says that she has nothing to do with it. But as she was drinking her cup of tea, her fingerprints were on the mug. The fingerprint that the police found on the body, and the fingerprint on Bree's cup match. The police go and talk to Ben, still about the murder of Alejandro. Ben keeps Bree's secret, and the police leave, with no more evidence than the fingerprint. But they do not stop there - a detective tracks down a call of Bree to Ben that night regarding Alejandro's murder, and they record it.\n\nIn order to defend herself, Bree asks Bob Hunter for legal advice, but he tells her she needs a crime lawyer. He recommends lawyer Trip Weston, whom he calls a \"shark\". Bree goes to trial but does not tell Trip all the truth, and is about to go to prison until Mrs. McCluskey confesses the murder of Alejandro herself, after Bree and the girls agree to take care of her during her last days of life. Bree is acquitted of all charges. In the end, Bree marries Trip and moves to Louisville, Kentucky where she joins a club for conservative women. Later she is encouraged by Trip to run for the city council, then the following November she is elected to the Kentucky Legislature.\n\nBree has received wide acclaim, both for the character's storylines, and for Cross' portrayal. In a review of the pilot, Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle called Cross \"almost too perfect as uptight Bree\", and applauds her for \"managing to give the character more shadings than merely insanely perfect.\"\n\nAt the commencement of the second season, Bree was widely considered the series' most prominent role, following the first year's emphasis on Susan Mayer. Though a drop in quality was noted in the second season, Bree's battles with alcohol, her teenage son, and her murderous pharmacist lover, while continuing to deal with the death of her husband, were well received, and considered the focal point of the series in light of the lagging Applewhite mystery.\n\nCross retained her center-stage position for the show's third season, which widely focused upon the mystery surrounding her new husband Orson. Critics noted an improvement in quality from the second season to the third, and many deemed Bree's storyline to be the most satisfying of the season, as well as noting a \"loss of steam\" during Cross' maternity leave at the latter part of the season.\n\nSeason 4's \"fake pregnancy\" storyline continued to satisfy critics, with one calling it the series' most \"hysterical [storyline] yet\", and singling Cross out for praise. Her friction with Katherine Mayfair was also noted as a highlight. Following the five year leap, a new direction was taken with Bree's character as she made the transition from housewife to author/businesswoman, a development which received positive reception.\n\nThis change in character development was continued into season 6, with another side to Bree's personality being shown, which includes an affair with Karl Mayer. Critics lauded the comic relief provided by these developments, as well as the more poignant and emotional turn mid-season as Bree deals with Orson's paralysis.\n\nIn Season 7, Bree finds herself newly divorced and embarks on a relationship with Keith Watson, a move which was praised for allowing \"the for-so-long uptight Bree letting her hair down and having some fun for a change.\" By the climax of season 7, Bree is central in covering up the murder of Gabrielle's stepfather, a move which was praised as a sound set up for the final season.\n\nMarcia Cross has received widespread acclaim for her portrayal of Bree. For her work on the second season of the show, she garnered the Satellite Award for Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy (her second nomination), and has also received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series twice as part of the cast (being nominated a further three times).\n\nIn 2005, Cross was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance in the season one episode, \"Running to Stand Still\". She also made the Top 10 Pre-Nomination Finalist listing for the same award three subsequent times, for her work on the second-season episode \"Next\", third-season episode \"Listen to the Rain on the Roof\", and fourth-season episode \"Now You Know\". She has received three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, for Best Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy, for her work on the first three seasons of the show, and has also received three nominations at the Prism Awards (for Performance in a Comedy Series, in relation to Bree's alcoholism), and a nomination from the Television Critics Association for Individual Achievement in Comedy in 2005.\n\nBree is spoofed in \"MADtv\"'s \"Desperate Housewives\" parody, in which they mock the character's plastic exterior and demeanor. In a 2006 interview with \"Charmed Magazine\", Michelle Stafford admitted that her character Mandi in \"Charmed\" episode \"Desperate Housewitches\" was almost entirely modeled on Marcia Cross as Bree. Looking at pictures and episodes of Bree to gain a sense of her posture and body language, she laughed, \"I'm just mimicking her. I'm just ripping her off.\"\n\nIn 2007, Madame Alexander released a line of 16-inch fashion dolls of the series' main characters, including Bree.\n\n\n"}

Normally cotton, the term is sometimes applied to a mixture of silk and cotton. Some velveteens are a kind of fustian, having a rib of velvet pile alternating with a plain depression. This fabric has a pile that is short (never more than 3 mm deep) and is closely set. It has a firm hand and a slightly sloping pile. Compared to true velvet, velveteen has greater body, does not drape as easily, and has less sheen.\n\nThe velveteen trade varies with the fashions that control the production of velvet.\n\n"}

She thereby was a niece of Emperor Henry V, the chronicler Otto of Freising was one of her older brothers. King Conrad III of Germany was her half-brother from her mother's first marriage with the Hohenstaufen duke Frederick I of Swabia; Emperor Frederick Barbarossa was her nephew.\n\nBy his marriage, Judith's father Leopold had climbed into the first row of Imperial princes. In 1125 he even was one of the possible candidates in the election as King of the Romans, he nevertheless forwent in favour of his stepson Duke Frederick II of Swabia.\n\nAbout 1133, Judith married the Aleramici marquess William V of Montferrat (d. 1191), by whom she bore at least eight children.

It is also added in many legends that his left arm was about 4 in. longer than his right, enabling a longer draw of the arrow, and more powerful shots. He fought to defend Shirakawa-den, alongside his father, against the forces of Taira no Kiyomori and Minamoto no Yoshitomo, his brother. The palace was set aflame, and Tametomo was forced to flee. \nAfter the Hōgen Rebellion, the Taira cut the sinews of Tametomo's left arm, limiting the use of his bow, and then he was banished to the island of Ōshima in the Izu Islands.

It is the southern boundary of the entrance to the long estuary of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAcross the mouth of the bay to the north is Cape Charles the opposite point of the Bay's gateway. Named for two sons of King James I of England in 1607, together Cape Henry and Cape Charles form the Virginia Capes.\n\nCape Henry was named on April 26, 1607 in honor of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the elder of two sons of King James I of England to survive to the age of 18 and heir-apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of England (later united in 1707 with neighboring Scotland as the Kingdom of Great Britain), by an expedition of the London Company branch of the proprietary Virginia Company headed by Captain Christopher Newport. After an unusually long voyage of 144 days from England, it was their first landfall, an event which has come to be called \"The First Landing\". Soon after this landing the English colonists erected a wooden cross and gave thanks for a successful crossing to a new land. In the First Charter of Virginia, King James I devoted parcels of land for the purpose of spreading the Christian religion. The Charter reads in part: \"We greatly commending, and graciously accepting of, their Desires for the Furtherance of so noble a Work, which may, by the Providence of Almighty God, hereafter tend to the Glory of his Divine Majesty, in propagating of Christian Religion to such People, as yet live in Darkness and miserable Ignorance...\"\n\nCaptain Newport, with his three ships, \"Susan Constant\", the \"Godspeed\", and the \"Discovery\", and the group of 104 men and boys, subsequently explored inland and established Jamestown on an island for protection offshore from the north shore further upstream on the James River which became the first permanent English settlement in North America.\nThe following year of 1608, Captain John Smith took a crew with a small boat outfitted with a sail and proceeded north up the Chesapeake Bay exploring and mapping its coasts and rivers, creeks and bays up to the later named Susquehanna River which fed the Bay. \nIn 1781, the waters off of these Virginia Capes and the entrance to the Chesapeake and Hampton Roads harbor were the site of an important naval clash between warships of the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of England near the end of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) in the Battle of the Capes. The victory of the French Navy over the British Royal Navy cut off the King's Army troops of Lord Charles Cornwallis surrounded, bombarded and under siege for a month at Yorktown, Virginia, a short distance up the Bay on the Western Shore's York River. They had been pursued after a series of clashes for several years in the Southern Theater in Georgia and the Carolinas by rebel patriot regular forces of soldiers under the command of Gen. Nathanael Greene and Daniel Morgan, along with irregular bands of guerilla partisans sniping and wearing down the Redcoats by attrition. As Cornwallis headed northward to the rich untouched colony of Virginia and also hoping to be reinforced / resupplied or evacuated if necessary on the ragged shores of the Carolina coast or the Chesapeake where British seapower and naval dominance could be brought to bear. The French fleet under Admiral deGrasse sent from the Caribbean Sea and West Indies islands with an unusual naval victory over the British taskforce who also had sent a second fleet from occupied New York retreating back northward which was supposed to reinforce and guard Cornwallis' seaward side. The British general was forced to surrender in October 1781 to a combined jointly commanded American-French Army with German states mercenary allies under Gen. George Washington, Gen. Marquis de Lafayette and French Army troops under Gen. Rochambeau who had deceived Gen. William Howe commander in New York where the Northern Theater had stalemated and sneaked out slipping and gaining several weeks march southward down the East Coast to surprise and catch Cornwallis' Redcoats camped at Yorktown in a siege. Finally for the first time in the six year long rebellion, the insurgents had numerical superiority in numbers and artillery along with adequate cooperating seapower from the French allies. The often little known sea Battle of the Capes a few miles off the American Virginia coast was the nail in the coffin to assure colonial independence as the War ended a year and a half later with the Treaty of Paris in 1783.\n\nThe Cape Henry Memorial commemorates The First Landing of the settlers that established Jamestown. Nearby, the historic Cape Henry Lighthouse was the first in the United Stateinterest, the passenger station built in 1902 and served by the original Norfolk Southern Railway was restored late in the 20th century and is used as an educational facility by Fort Story, an army base located at Cape Henry that was established in 1914. First Landing State Park occupies and protects the rest of the cape itself, as well as some of the nearby area. Shore Drive, a locally well-known road, facilitates viewing of the rest of the shoreline in Cape Henry.\n\n"}

The criticism states that there is no real difference between \"the truth in the world\" (alethic) and \"the truth in an individual's mind\" (epistemic). An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities would be formally distinguished, for example by the means of a grammatical mood. In such a language, \"A circle can't be square\", \"can't be\" would be expressed by an alethic mood, whereas for \"He can't be that wealthy\", \"can't be\" would be expressed by an epistemic mood. As we can see, this is not a distinction drawn in English grammar.\n\n\"You can't give these plants too much water.\" is a well-known play on the distinction between perhaps alethic and hortatory or injunctive modalities. The dilemma is fairly easily resolved when listening through paralinguistic cues and particularly suprasegmental cues (intonation). So while there may not be a morphologically based alethic mood, this does not seem to preclude the usefulness of distinguishing between these two types of modes. Alethic modality might then concern what are considered to be apodictic statements.\n"}

He has also been in the disbanded \"Spiky\", \"Dizzy Drive\" and \"Marmarsa☆mu (マァマァサ☆ムゥ)\".\n\nMasa was born on the 30th of September in Kyoto, year unknown. After graduating from a , he went to the U.S.A. alone and took the TOEFL after one year. He then studied music at a university for three years. He learned the English language while living in New York for four years. A day after he graduated from the university, he returned home.\n\nBeing raised in a rather strict family and never really having watched TV in his childhood except for educational programs, he came a long way from the boy listening to Bon Jovi on borrowed cassette tapes and singing covers of Kurt Cobain songs to being the accomplished international musician he was later. After buying his first CD, Metallica's \"...Justice For All\", it was basically the song \"One\" which inspired him to play the guitar. He started to learn it with getting lessons from an older friend in the neighbourhood who had a band. He paid for the lessons with working as a roadie for them. In junior high and high school years he formed various bands, playing in sessions at first and later in live houses around the area. Feeling restricted by the rules and regulations of the Japanese school system he decided to go to America.\n\nSo, after graduating from Vocational School he went to New York alone. He had no knowledge in English and arrived with just one suitcase and his guitar.\n\"I was truly starting from nothing but it's from nothing that you can be reborn.\" he said.\nStudying English in language school with fellow students from all over the world, he went from the lowest to the highest level in three months only. To attend the university he wanted, he needed a score of at least 550 in the TOEFL exam. After only getting about 300 on first try, he went back to studying for another ten months and finally reached his goal. He went to the Parsons School of Design to study music, art, English and more. There he became an excellent guitarist, being able to play all kinds of different styles like classical, jazz or rock. He was also able to play in many sessions there with all kinds of musicians, enjoying the more flexible and independent ways of the music business in America.\n\nAfter four years of studying and living in New york he returned to Japan one day after graduation and only one week later was hired by Yusuke Asada (U-SKE Asada), a famous producer and artist who has performed with major label groups like Chara, produced video game and movie soundtracks and major artists like Crystal Kay. He says about this time that it was his true beginning as a musician. During this time he also met Gackt who asked him to play as a guitarist in GacktJob for his Mars Tour in 2000. He continued his work there until spring 2002 when he decided to go independent and start his solo career as the front man in the band Spiky.\n\"I wanted to be able to grow as a composer in my own right, as well as being able to write lyrics and become a vocalist.\" he said.\nThey toured Japan and released eleven CDs until he left in the end of 2004. They held two final concerts in 2006 before officially disbanding.\n\nIn the beginning of 2005 masa then formed his very own band, DIZZY DRIVE, touring Japan and releasing a couple of demo CDs and one CD album. In 2006 he felt it's time for evolution and radically changed the image and musical style of the band. \nWith the members still staying the same more or less, the band name was changed to マァマァサ☆ムゥ. Sadly, just after having achieved national recognition and getting ready to a tour of Japan in February 2007, their activities came to a screeching halt when masa was involved in a near fatal traffic accident. After a long recovery time he resumed his work and returned on stage in October of the same year. After some concerts, demo CDs and even a TV appearance masa finally decided to take a break for an indefinite period of time and so マァマァサ☆ムゥ disbanded in March 2008.\nHe also played in various session lives covering Buck-Tick and LunaSea songs among others.\n\n- Credits: Various sources online and the article about masa in the first issue of Five For magazine (December 2007) which also features an interview with him.]\n\nMasa worked with Yusuke Asada as support and later backed-up Gackt, joining his project as the electro-, drum-acoustic- and rhythm guitarist of \"GacktJOB\", from which he first rose to fame in the Japanese music scene.\nThere are many stories and rumors circulating about the first meeting between Gackt and Masa; a popular story among fans is that Gackt met Masa in New York and wanted to see him play the guitar, but Masa pretended that he couldn't play and watched Gackt's own guitar playing instead.\n\nMasa decided to leave GacktJOB to work on his own career with \"Spiky\", for which he was vocalist and guitarist. During this time Spiky released 2 singles, 6 maxi singles, 1 album and 2 mini albums. However, the project Spiky came to a halt as Masa left in 2005 to start his very own project, \"Dizzy Drive\". The remaining members tried to recruit a new vocalist and the new formation was supposed to debut on the same day as Masa with DIZZY DRIVE, but it never happened. After two final lives in August 2006 Spiky officially announced their disbanding.\n\nIn the beginning of June 2006, Masa announced that with the agreement of all members, DIZZY DRIVE would start over with a new concept; since they couldn't identify with their old band name anymore, they also created a new name. The last concert under the name of DIZZY DRIVE was on the second of July. Masa also started to work as a guitarist again, first with the session band JET STREAM ATTACK (covering BUCK-TICK) in June and then on the second Summer Festival, organized by Seventh Heaven with the session band Sin After Sin (covering Luna Sea) in July; he also performed as a singer with Spiky again in August 2006 in two lives, acoustic and electric, which seemed to have been the end of that project. A break was announced until September 2006, after which he returned with his new project, マァマァサ☆ムゥ, which consisted of the same members as DIZZY DRIVE but with the new concept and style. Instead of the more rock attitude of DIZZY DRIVE, their shows are now quite theatrical and the music has a touch of eighties rock. Junn decided to leave the band in January 2007 but due to Masa's nearly fatal road accident, the announcement was postponed until July. From the time of the comeback concert in October 2007 until the final concert in March 2008, Masanori joined the band for support again, but they remained officially only three members.\n\nOn the March 16, 2008, マァマァサ☆ムゥ disbanded and Masa announced that he would take a break for the time being. He does not know if he will return as a singer, guitarist, or both, and has not said when he'll return.\n\nMasa has participated in several projects since his introduction to the Japanese music scene: GacktJOB, Spiky, Dizzy Drive and マァマァサ☆ムゥ\n\nMembers:\n\nMembers:\nTheir official logo was JETBOY and their official fanclub (shared with Spiky) was known as CHRONICLE.\n\n1st Demo CD(22 May 2005)\n\n2nd Demo CD(15 July 2005)\n\n3rd Demo CD(6 September 2005)\n\nSUPER SONIC(1 March 2006)\n\nDVDR 1(21 January 2006)\n\nDVD Evolution(14 May 2006)\n\nPresented CD(August 2005)\n\n1st Demo CD(2 September 2006)\n\n2nd Demo CD(30 September 2006)\n\n3rd Demo CD(20 October 2006)\n\n4th Demo CD(22 November 2006)\n\n5th Demo CD(2 December 2006)\n\n6th Demo CD(10 December 2006)\n\n7th Demo CD(29 December 2006)\n\n8th Demo CD(6 October 2007)\n\nDVD-R(6 October 2007)\n\n9th Demo CD(4 November 2007)\n\n10th Demo CD(2 December 2007)\n\n11th Demo CD(27 December 2007)\n\n12th Demo CD(26 January 2008)\n\n13th Demo CD(24 February 2008)\n\n14th Demo CD(16 March 2008)\n\nDear.Angel(16 March 2008)\n\n\n"}

His father was a supervisor of studies (\"pion\"), later a teacher, and unfaithful to Jules' mother. Jules was a brilliant student. The Revolution of 1848 in France found him participating in protests in Nantes where his father had been assigned to teach. It was during this period that he began to align himself with the budding socialist movement. After being sent to Paris to prepare for his entrance into Lycée Condorcet (1850) he neglected his studies altogether. He took part in the uprising against Napoleon III during the French coup of 1851, fighting together with his friend Arthur Ranc at one of the rare barricades on December 2. Vallès later fled to Nantes, where his father had him committed to a mental institution.(ref 1978, Bernard Noël e.a.) Thanks to help from his friend Antoine Arnould, he managed to escape a few months later. He returned to Paris, where he joined the staff of \"Le Figaro\", and became a regular contributor to the other leading journals.\n\nIn 1853 he was arrested for conspiring against Napoleon III, but was later freed due to a lack of evidence. He lived in poverty, writing journalism for bread (the stock market page of the Figaro even, until fired for his bias against capitalism). It was under these conditions that he wrote his first book \"L'Argent\" (1857). \"Les Amours de Paille\" (1859), a comedy written in collaboration with Poupart-Davyl, was a failure.(ref 1990 Alain Viala) At the insistence of his colleague Henri Rochefort he found an administrative job issuing birth certificates for the Vaugirard town hall.(1860) He became a steady friend of Hector Malot and began to live with his lover, Joséphine Lapointe. He decided to become a \"pion\" himself in Caen, but was quickly discharged. Back in Paris, his friend Hector Malot helped him reacquire his job at the town hall. In 1864–1865 he wrote literary criticism for \"Progrès de Lyon\". In 1865 he collected much of his newspaper work in a book \"Les Refractaires\" that sold well. A second collection in 1866 \"La Rue\" had less success. In 1867 he started the newspaper \"La Rue\", which was later suppressed by the government after a mere eight months of publication. \n\nBy this time he was a recognized leader of the republican opposition against the Second French Empire. In 1865 he had lost his job at Vaugirard for a speech he gave against the capitalist society of the Second Empire, eluding the censorship by advertising a talk on Balzac. In 1868 he was twice convicted for press crimes: one month in prison for criticizing the police, two months for criticising the Empire. At the elections of 1869 he was the candidate to the left opposing the moderate Jules Simon.\nHe lost the election and went to work for \"La Marseillaise\" the newspaper of Henri Rochefort, meanwhile contributing to \"La Liberté\" of Émile de Girardin.\n\nIn the summer of 1869 members of several \"Chambres syndicales\" of Paris workers rented a space at nr 6, Place de la Corderie to hold the meetings of the \"Chambre fédérale des Sociétés ouvrières\", the \"Conseil fédéral des sections parisiennes de l'Internationale\", and as the events unfolded the \"Comité central républicain des Vingt Arrondissements\" (1870) and the \"Comité central de la Garde nationale\". (March 1871) It was to be the very organisational center of the Paris Commune. Its activities are prominently described in \"Jacques Vingtras:L'Insurgé\". Jules Vallès had friends and connections among all the tendencies represented: Proudhon, blanquist, marxist and while he was himself independent of all of them he represented the active force of each. He was well known and well liked and when in 1870 the Government of National Defence spread the rumour that the candidates of the extreme left including Vallès had been on the payroll of the Imperial police at the 1869 elections, the Corderie gave him a vote of confidence.\n\nThe year leading up to the Paris Commune began with the assassination of Victor Noir (January 10). Jules Vallès and Henri Rochefort found themselves at the head of the mass manifestation at Victor Noir's funeral (January 12); Rochefort interceding with the blanquist Gustave Flourens who wanted to begin the anti-imperial insurrection there and then.\n\nIn July Napoleon III embroiled France in the Franco-Prussian War. Vallès was among the very few anti-war protesters, and was jailed as a consequence (August 6). On September 2 Napoleon III capitulated at Sedan and was captured. On September 4 the Third French Republic was proclaimed and the Government of National Defence installed.(Gambetta) Vallès was freed from prison and took part in the popular manifestations leading to the formation of the \"Comité central républicain des Vingt arrondissements\" of which he -like many other leaders of the Paris Commune- became a prominent member; heading even, for a while, a battalion of the \"Garde nationale\". On September 18 the Prussians laid siege on a Paris unwilling to accept defeat and calling for all out war by the provinces. On October 5, Flourens marched the five battalions \"Garde nationale\" of Belleville in disciplined military fashion to the Hôtel de Ville to show preparedness. On October 31, a first blanquist uprising erupted at Belleville with Vallès in command of his battalion occupying the town hall of la Vilette. The uprising failed and Vallés had to go in hiding.\n\nAt the start of 1871 Jules Vallès at the initiative of the \"Comité central républicain des Vingt arrondissements\" edited the \"Affiche Rouge\" posted on January 7 : the first call for the proclamation of the Paris Commune. On Mars 11, Vallès was judged for his participation in the October plot. He escaped from the tribunal after hearing himself condemned to six months in prison, and his \"Le Cri du Peuple\" which he had started on February 22, banned from further appearance. On March 18, the Commune was officially proclaimed; March 21, \"Le Cri du Peuple\" reappeared to become one of the most successful newspapers of the Commune - together with \"Père Duchêne\". On March 26 he was elected by the 15th district (Vaugirard: 4,403 votes of 6,467 voters) to the Conseil de la Commune; nominated to the commission of Public Education (March 29).\n\nAlthough quick to the march when it came to demand individual liberties Jules Vallès was also a voice for opposite opinion: he claimed his reserve when the separation of Church and State was proclaimed (April 2), opposed the suppression of the \"reactionary\" newspapers (April 26), he voted against the institution of the Comité de Salut with its jacobin tendencies, and together with 22 other prominent members - among them his old friend Arnould, the painter Gustave Courbet, Vermorel, Varlin...he signed the manifest of the minority which he published in his newspaper. (May 15)\n\nOn May 21 the Versailles troops entered Paris through the porte Saint-Cloud while Vallès, among minority members reintegrated in the Commune, presided over its last session - in judgement over Cluseret and his failure to hold the fort of Issy (and with Vallès in sympathy with the defendant). During the Semaine Sanglante (May 21 – May 28) he took part in the fighting, making a last stand in the rue de Paris (now rue de Belleville) on May 28 with his steadfast friend Gabriel Ranvier. Together they managed to escape the fusillades and went into exile. In 1872 both were given death sentences \"in absentia\".\n\nJules Vallès' newspaper \"Le Cri du Peuple -Journal politique quotidien, 10 centimes\" was among the most successful of the Paris Commune. Only \"Journal Officiel\", \"La Commune\", \"Le Mot d'Ordre\", \"le Père Duchêne\" and \"le Vengeur\" appear to have been contending rivals. Its style has been described as \"simple firmity, sympathetic authority, reflected realism due to a conviction rendered spontaneously lyrical by its sincerity\" by Bernard Noël, who read through the entire press produced in Paris 1871 for his \"Dictionnaire de la Commune\" (1978).\n\nAfter the paper was banned by General Vinoy (1871) on March 11 (nr18), it was reissued on March 21 (nr19) and was published without interruption until Tuesday May 23 (nr83).\n\nIts collaborators were: Casimir Bouis, Jean-Baptiste Clément, Pierre Denis, and Charles Rochat, with occasional articles by Henry Bauer (1851–1915), Courbet, and André Leo.\n\nBecause of the communal tasks taken up by most other editors, the work of chief editor in practice fell to Pierre Denis, who set the tone with accent on the Proudhonian ideology. He represented his views in the First International, of which he was a member: recognition of individual liberties, suppression of the permanent army and police, \"Laïcité\" and free education, entire benefit of work produced, autonomy of the commune -or Voluntary association, autonomy, federation, and union.\n\nThe foregoing events were all chronicled in the three parts of Jules Vallès major work: \"Jacques Vingtras\": \"L'Enfant\", \"Le Bachelier\", \"L'insurgé\". Vallès wrote \"Jacques Vingtras\" during his bitter exile following the Paris Commune.\n\nVallès went to live in exile in London. In 1875 Vallès, in the absence of his companion Joséphine Lapointe, had an affair with another woman. She bore his daughter, but when the girl died at 10 months, Vallès quickly separated from the mother. This period in 1876 marked his complete destitution. His friend Hector Malot negotiated the publication of his novel \"Jacques Vingtras - L'Enfant\" as a serial (\"feuilleton\") in the newspaper \"Le Siècle\" (June–August 1878). The extreme realism combined with corrosive irony resulted in a negative public reaction and dropping of the project. In January–May 1879 \"Le Bachelier\" appeared in \"La Révolution française\" under the title \"Les Mémoires d'un révolté\". The first book \"Jacques Vingtras - L'Enfant, Le Bachelier\" was published by Charpentier and signed 'Jean La Rue' (Vallès had tried to start the paper \"La Rue\" in Brussels that same year - a failure).\n\nIn 1879–1880 he came to know Séverine, whose friendship secured the final draft of \"L'Insurgé\". She persuaded Charpentier to publish the book in 1886, after Vallès's death.\n\nAmong the French authors most influenced by the racy, concise and ironic style of Jules Vallès is Jules Renard, author of the child's portrait \"Poil de Carotte\". Séverine at least recognised the quality of the prose of her friend in his writings (see: Jules Renard \"Journal 1897-1910\").\n\nAfter his liberation on 11 June 1879, Blanqui had managed to get support from Gambetta for the plight of the many thousand destitutes who had been implicated in the Paris Commune. On 11 July 1880 the government issued a general pardon, in the wake of which Vallès was able to return to Paris. There he renewed his journalism with vigour. In 1881 he was among the 100,000 mourners in procession for Blanqui's funeral.\n\nIn 1883 he was entirely successful in restarting \"Le Cri du Peuple\" as a voice for libertarian and socialist ideas. At the same time he became increasingly ill with diabetes. During a health crisis in November 1884, he was taken to the house of doctor Guebhard and his secretary Séverine. He assigned Hector Malot to be the executor of his will and died on 14 February 1885.\n\nHis funeral was also a major public event, attracting a procession of some 60,000 following the coffin to Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

It is the primary spoken language of Thai Malays, but is also used as a lingua franca by ethnic Southern Thais in rural areas, Muslim and non-Muslim and the \"samsam\", a mostly Thai-speaking population of mixed Malay and Thai ancestry.\n\nKelantan-Pattani Malay is a highly divergent from other Malay varieties because of its geographical isolation from the rest of the Malay world by high mountains, deep rainforest and the Gulf of Thailand. In Thailand, it is also influenced by Thai.\n\nKelantanese-Pattani Malay is distinct enough that radio broadcasts in Standard Malay cannot be understood easily by native speakers of Kelantanese-Pattani Malay, such as those in Thailand, who are not taught the standard language. Unlike Malaysia where Standard Malay is compulsory in the school curriculum, no one is required to learn Standard Malay in Thailand and so there is potentially less language influence from standard Malay but potentially more from Thai. It is also distinct from Kedah Malay, Pahang Malay and Terengganuan Malay, but those languages still have a close relationship with the Kelantanese-Pattani Malay language.\n\nKelantanese Malay is written both in Latin and in the Jawi alphabet, based on the Arabic script, which is where the name \"Yawi/Jawi\" for the language comes from. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the general population of Malay speakers in both Malaysia and Indonesia that now use the Latin script, known in Malay as rumi (رومي), for daily communication. Today, Pattani Malay itself is generally not a written language, though it is sometimes written in informal settings or eye dialect. When writing is needed, an old-fashioned form of standard Malay is used rather than the local dialect. A phonetic rendering of Pattani Malay in the Thai alphabet has been introduced, but it has not met with much success, due to the socio-religious significance of Jawi to Muslim Malays.\n\nThe language is often referred to in Thai as \"Phasa Yawi\" (Thai: ภาษายาวี ), which is a corruption of the Malay name for the modified Arabic alphabet for writing Malay, Jawi (Yawi: جاوي, Rumi: Jawi, ). It is also referred to in Thai as \"Phasa Malayu Pattani\" (Thai: ภาษามลายูปัตตานี ) and similarly locally in Malay as \"Bahasa Malayu Patani\" (Jawi: بهاس ملايو ڤطاني, Rumi: Bahasa Melayu Patani, ). The language is often simply just called \"Bahasa Patani\".\n\nKelantanese is known in Standard Malay as , and in Kelantanese as \"Baso Kelaté\". It is also known as \"Baso Besut\" or \" Kecek Kelaté-Besut\" in Besut and Setiu of Terengganu State.\n\nOther variant of Kelantan-Patani Language is Reman variant and also known as \"Bahasa Reman\" (according to area of these speakers and spoken areas were under Reman state of \"Pattani Kingdom that abolished in 1909\" in which areas of Batu Kurau, inland Perak (Gerik, Pengkalan Hulu, Lenggong) and inland Kedah (Sik, Baling, Padang Terap). The Reman viarants are known in various names such as \"Bahasa Patani\", \"Bahasa Patani Kedah-Perak\", \"Basa Grik\", \"Cakak Hulu\", \"Basa Kapong\", \"Basa Baling\" etc. It is also known as \"\"\"Dialect of Kedah Hulu\"\" (for those in Kedah) and \"\"Dialect of Perak Hulu\"\" (for those in Perak) but these two terms are only apply for political and geographical rather than linguistically. This Reman variant has many dialects and subdialects across the areas this variant spoken.\n\nThere are 21 consonants and 12 vowels in Pattani Malay. The phonemes // and // only appear in some loanwords or proper names.\n\nKelantan-Pattani Malay can be divided into 3 major variants and several dialects (and a few subdialects) thusly:\n\nKelantan: Coastal (Narathiwat, Besut dialects), Central / River, Dabong / Inland\n\nPattani: Yala, Saiburi, Bana Taning, Chenok / Chana, Nonthaburi / Bangkok\n\nReman: Grik, Sik, Baling, Padang Terap, Batu Kugho / Selama, Southern Yala\n\n\nCreole/Pidgin: Samsam Malay (a mixed language of Thai and Pattani Malay spoken by those of mixed Thai-Malay ancestry)\n\nKelantanese is spoken in the Malaysian state of Kelantan, as well as in Besut and Setiu districts of Terengganu and the Perhentian Islands. It is also spoken in the Merapoh township, in the Lipis district of Pahang since this town borders the state of Kelantan. \n\nMany people in the districts of Baling, Sik and Padang Terap in Kedah as well as Grik and Hulu Perak districts of Perak speak Kelantan-Patani language of \"Reman\" dialects, since most of the Malay people there are the descendants of Kelantanese migrants and Pattani refugees also former areas of Reman Kingdom of Patani.\n\nPattani Malay is the main language of the Thai provinces of Narathiwat, Yala and Pattani where ethnic Malays make up the majority of the population, it is also spoken in some parts of Songkhla and Bangkok. It is less spoken in the province of Satun, where despite making up the majority, ethnic Malays generally speak Southern Thai and their Malay dialect is similar to Kedah Malay. It is also spoken in scattered villages as far north as Hat Yai. In the past, Malay was the main language as far north as the Isthmus of Kra, the traditional division between Central Thailand and Southern Thailand, based on the preponderance of etymologically Malay place names.\n\nKelantanese is different enough from Standand Malay that it is often unintelligible to speakers of the standard language. Differences include different vocabulary, but also involve regular sound changes. The influence of Southern Thai and Pattani Malay upon each other is great, and both have large numbers of loanwords from the other. The influence of the Thai language is one factor that makes comprehension between Pattani Malay and Standard Malay difficult.\n\nPronunciation\n\nVocabulary\n\nBahasa Kelantan-Pattani (BKP) vs Bahasa Melayu (BM)\n\nSapo vs Siapa (Who)\n\nBilo vs Bila (When)\n\nMano vs Mana (Where)\n\nBakpo vs Kenapa/Mengapa (Why)\n\nLagumano vs Bagaimana (How)\n\nJoong vs Mendung (Cloudy)\n\nTebolah vs Cuai (Careless)\n\nKATok vs Katak (Frog)\n\nKatok vs Pukul / Ketuk (Beat)\n\nSelalu / lALu vs Sekarang (Right Away, Now)\n\nSokmo vs Selalu (Always)\n\n\nSouthern Thailand has continued to be a region affected by two cultural spheres: the mainly Buddhist, Thai-speaking Siamese kingdoms and the mainly Muslim, Malay-speaking sultanates. The region was a warehouse of trade where merchants from Europe, India, Arabia, China, Siam, and the other Malay world met. At first dominated by Hindu-Buddhist Indian influences, the great kingdom of Srivijaya would later fall in chaos. Islam was introduced by Arab and Indian traders in the 11th century and has been the dominant religion ever since, replacing the Buddhism and Hinduism that had held sway before. By the 14th century, the area became vassals to Ayutthaya, but the region was autonomous and never fully incorporated into the modern Thai nation-state till 1902. This political autonomy and isolation from the rest of the Malay world allowed for preservation of the Malay language and culture but also led to the divergence of the dialect.\n\n"}

Its principal claim to fame is that Joseph Conrad lived and wrote there. Unlike some other areas of Thurrock, Stanford-le-Hope is surrounded by countryside and farmland.\n\nStanford-le-Hope is bordered to the north by the A13 road and to the south by the Thames Estuary. It is located 12.7 miles (20.5 km) west of Southend-on-Sea. The town centre has a village feel with its 800-year-old church, St Margarets making a prominent and attractive landmark around which shops, pubs and restaurants have grown to create a lively core to the town.\n\nAs Stanford-le-Hope grows in size, it has started to incorporate neighbouring settlements such as Corringham, Mucking and Fobbing, the latter of which was the scene of one of the uprisings which led to the Peasants' Revolt.\n\nThe River Hope, a tributary of the Thames, runs through the town.\n\nLocally there are a number of parks and nature reserves, notably Thurrock Thameside Nature Reserve, with a visitor centre providing views up and down the Thames across both industrial and natural landscapes including the Mucking Flats SSSI.\n\nIn 2014, a group of residents led a restoration project which raised funds to finance a restoration of the war memorial, as part of the commemoration of the 1914-1919 conflict in Europe.\n\nThe town is served by Stanford-le-Hope railway station.\n\nThe town is home to many commuters working in London, thanks to its proximity to the capital and its c2c-operated London, Tilbury and Southend Railway rail connections.

He was educated at Dame's School, Parramatta and, despite his family's poverty, the Sydney Academy and Sydney College under the tutelage of William Timothy Cape, and left school at the age of 16 to become a reporter.\n\nIn 1838, Martin published the \"Australian Sketch Book\", a series of character sketches he dedicated to Sydney barrister George Robert Nichols, for whom he was then working as an articled clerk in 1840.\n\nMartin qualified as a solicitor in 1845, and combined his legal career with employment as a newspaper editor and publisher. He married Isabella Long on 20 January 1853 and together they produced 15 children.\n\nIn February 1848 Martin nominated as a candidate for a by-election for the electorate of Durham in the New South Wales Legislative Council, but withdrew before polling day. In the general election held later in the same year he was a candidate for the electorate of Counties of Cook and Westmoreland, which he won with a margin of 16%. His election however was declared void on the grounds that he did not meet the property qualifications to stand, however he was re-elected unopposed. Martin subsequently sued the Speaker of the Legislative Council, Charles Nicholson and the Sergeant at Arms, William Christie, for trespass for having him removed when there had been no decision of the Electoral Court in accordance with the \"Electoral Act\" 1843. The Full Court of the Supreme Court held that under the \"Electoral Act\" 1843 it was only the Electoral Court that could determine there was a vacancy and not the Governor.\n\nMartin was an effective legislator but his sharp tongue and intemperate speeches to the House made him few friends among his parliamentary colleagues. His most notable political achievement in his first eight years in office was to initiate the Parliamentary debate that led to the establishment of a branch of the royal mint in Sydney.\n\nIn 1856 the partly elected unicameral Legislative Council was abolished and replaced with a new parliament with elected members of the Legislative Assembly and appointed members of the Legislative Council. Martin was elected as one of two members for Cook and Westmoreland. When that electorate was largely replaced by the single member electorate of Hartley, Martin successfully stood for the new four member electorate of East Sydney. He was subsequently the member for Orange, Tumut, Monaro, Lachlan and East Macquarie. In August 1856 he was made Attorney-General of New South Wales in the first ministry of Charles Cowper. The appointment was controversial, as Martin was the first holder of the office who had not been admitted as a barrister. He had to resign his seat as a result of accepting the office, however he was re-elected unopposed. The appointment was brief, as the government was defeated in a no-confidence motion in October 1856 and Martin returned to the backbench.\n\nMartin was admitted to the bar in 1856 and was made a Queen's Counsel in 1857. He returned as Attorney General in the second Cowper Ministry in September 1857, and was again re-elected unopposed. As Attorney General however, his reputation for intemperate language continued and after a series of conflicts with fellow Ministers he resigned the office in November 1858.\n\nIn October 1863, Martin was asked by the Governor of New South Wales to form a government with a mandate to address rising State deficits and rural unemployment. As Premier and Colonial Secretary Martin promptly introduced measures to reduce immigration and increase tariffs, but was unable to secure Parliamentary support for many of his reforms. With limited achievements to its credit, the government suffered a substantial swing at the 1865 election and Martin stepped down to make way for the return of Charles Cowper.\n\nCowper was once again defeated in a no-confidence motion in December 1865, and in January 1866 Martin became Premier for the second time as leader of a coalition government with former rival Henry Parkes. His government resigned in October 1868, but he returned to the Premiership for a third and final time between December 1870 and May 1872.\n\nMartin retired from Parliament in November 1873 and was immediately named to the vacant position of Chief Justice of New South Wales. He held the post for 13 years, despite considerable ill health in later life.\n\nJames Martin died at home in Potts Point, Sydney on 4 November 1886 and buried in St Judes churchyard in Randwick, NSW. in 1909 his remains were moved to a new underground vault in the impressive Waverley Cemetery.\n\nMartin was made a Queen's Counsel in 1857, and was knighted in 1869. Martin Place, a pedestrian mall in the central business district of Sydney was named after him in 1892. 'Lady Martin Beach' a small beach accessible to the public from Wolseley Road, Point Piper, New South Wales is named after his wife, Isabella who resided at nearby Woollahra House.\n\n\n \n"}

With 79.4% of the population living in the urban area, the city counted in 2009 with eleven healthcare facilities. Its Human Development Index (HDI) is 0.783, considered high by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the 11th largest in the Rio Grande do Sul state, the 110th of Brazil and the first of its micro-region.\n\nThe colonization of the city occurred in 1927, when the first German colonists arrived in the region. A year later came more families from other ethnic groups, causing the place to develop. The first name of the city council was \"Belo Horizonte\", later becoming \"Vila Horizonte\", \"Horizonte\" and the current name, Horizontina, in 1944. Before being elevated to a municipality, it was a district in the municipality of \"Santa Rosa\". Only in December 1954 the district was emancipated.\n\nThe city is known as the \"Cradle of National Harvesters Automotive\", due to construction of the first Brazilian automotive harvester in the city in 1965. Even today, a unit of US company John Deere is installed in Horizontina, generating about 80% of all tax revenues of the city.\n\nThe German dialect Riograndenser Hunsrückisch is a regional language and as such an integral part of the history of many municipalities throughout the state of Rio Grande do Sul since pioneer days, including Horizontina. The dialect is spoken by millions of people in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, it is also part of the history of Horizontina and the state's northwest region. In 2012 the Legislative Assembly voted unanimously in favor of official recognition of Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, the German dialect more spoken in Brazil, and with the highest concentration of speakers in Rio Grande do Sul, as part of the intangible cultural heritage to be preserved and protected.\n\n<br>\n"}

The range extends along the south of the Pothohar Plateau and the North of the Jhelum River. The Salt Range contains the great mines of Khewra, Kalabagh and Warcha which yield vast supplies of salt. Coal of a medium quality is also found.\n\n\nThe Awan, Gakhars, and Janjuas had engaged in an endless battle for sovereignty over the Salt Range.\n\nBut later in the 16th century, the Awan drove out Janjuas and Ghakhars from the western parts of the Salt Range.\n\nAccording to the Emperor Babar, the Jud and the Janjuha were \"two races descended from the same father, \" who from old times had been rulers of the hills between Nilab and Bhera, that is, of the Salt Range. \"On one-half of the hill lived the Jud, and on the other half the Janjua.\" The Awans now occupy western half of these hills towards Nilab and Janjuas (Rajputs) on eastern part of these Hills. Juds are actually a sub-clan of Janjuas and there are still 7 seven villages of Juds near Dhrabi Area of Chakwal including Dhrabi village and Dam. They are descendants of Raja Jodh who was 2nd Prince of Janjua King Raja Mal Dev Khan Janjua.There are several forts on these hills and all of them were built by Janjua Rajputs and there ancestors the Pandav's at Katas Raj as well as the Janjua Shahi Dynasty of 2nd Kabul Shahis at Nandna fort.\nAlso this area is known as the first ever Muslim Rajputs Kingdom and Raja Mal Dev Khan Janjua was the founder of This Kingdom. He was from Chandravanshi Rathore Rajputs clan and he was from the bloodline of famous Indian Mahabharata Warrior Prince Arjun Dev Pandav.\n\nAbout 1500 Janjua Rajputs warrior cavalry fought in the battle of Panipat from this area in support of Babur under the command Malik Hast Khan Janjua (Asad). \nSultan Lashkar Janjua and Raja Sanghral Ali Khan Janjuas were also commanding their own Muslim Janjua Rajputs during Battle of Panipat and Battle of Khanwa against Rana Sanga. All of them were rulers of these Hills and chieftains of this ruling Rajput clan. Before these hills were known as Koh-e-jodh, it was on the name of Raja Jodh Janjua son of Raja Mal Dev Khan Janjua.\n\nTwo interesting sites are close to Kathwai, Kutte Mar, and Tulaja fort. At Kuttee Mar to the Northeast of Kathwai are Muslim graves made of Kangar and the purported grave of a dog that is said to have died defending the wedding procession of its owner from an attack by bandits. Kutte Mar may have been the place where the Khura inscription of Toramana was found (Buhler 1891–92, 238–41; Sircar 1965: 422–4). If this assessment is correct, a Buddhist monastery was established here around 500. A.D. This inscription and another fragmentary inscription found at Sakaser (Pakistan Archaeology 5, 1968: 284-70) confirm that this area was a flourishing, center for Buddhism, which is borne out by the extensive archaeological remains.\nThe Tulaja fort is located on a huge rock outcropping with sheer cliffs overlooking the shrine of Kacchianwalla and the Punjab plains. The entire area is covered with the ruins of defensive walls, houses, and other structures made of large stone blocks. Although one building has been identified as a mosque, it is very difficult to distinguish other religious, military or civil structures. One of the most interesting features is a large square tank made of the flat rectangular bricks, which may have supplied water so that the fort could withstand a siege. Comparing this tank with those in other forts may help in assigning a relative date to its construction. In addition to architectural styles, evidence from any coins, which are found here, may help to indicate if this city belonged to the period of the Turk Sultans, Lodhis or Mughals. Extensive remains of a cemetery and other settlements are on the slopes below the fort. There are also supposed to be some remains on Tulaji across the valley from Talaja.\n\nThe Salt Range has a high level of biodiversity and is home to a number of wildlife sanctuaries (ChumbiSurla, Jahlar Lake, Sodhi, Khabekki Lake and KundalRakh) and protected areas, including the Chinji National Park and several forest (e.g. Simli Reserved Forest and Noorpur Reserved Forest) and wetland areas (including Ucchali, Jahlar and Khabbiki lakes).\n\n\n\n"}

Churchill (February 13, 1891 – September, 1969) was a car dealer in Bismarck, North Dakota who funded an integrated baseball team in the mid-thirties more than a decade before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball.\n\nChurchill joined Wickham Corwin's Bismarck automobile dealership in 1925 and the company became Corwin-Churchill Motor Co. A colleague said he \"was a hell of a salesman—a smart fellow and real promoter.\" In 1937, when Corwin moved to Fargo, Churchill stayed in Bismarck. When Churchill retired in 1952 he sold his share of the business to the Corwin family.\n\nHe also owned the Prince Hotel, Bismarck.\n\nImmediately after World War I Churchill took up baseball with the Bismarck semi-pro team and became their star player. He bought the team in 1933 and, from his experience of playing against black touring teams, he decided that recruiting black players would strengthen his new team. He called Abe Saperstein to recruit some Negro League players.\n\nThe first three black players to join the Bismarck Churchills were Quincy Trouppe (Chicago American Giants catcher, Red Haley (Memphis Red Sox (infielder), and Roosevelt Davis (Pittsburgh Crawfords) pitcher. When these proved insufficient to beat Bismarck's great rivals in Jamestown, Churchill recruited Satchel Paige from the Crawfords. Gus Greenlee, the Crawfords' owner, threatened to knife Churchill for the 'theft' of Paige.\n\nPaige arrived from Chicago on the day of the game in October 1933. It was the first time that he had played alongside white players. Churchill won his bet of $1000 with a Jamestown politician that his team would win. A rematch was held a few days later in Jamestown before a crowd of 4000. After twelve innings the game was ended, unresolved, by darkness. Churchill challenged Jamestown to a three-game series in Bismarck. Bismarck won that series and the state championship.\n\nNext season (1934), Churchill spent $5,000 (using personal and city funds, and federal emergency relief labor) improving on the Bismarck ball park. He built a 3000-seat grandstand, children's bleachers, and a 500-space car park, with a clear view of the game along the outfield fence.\n\nChurchill's 1935 team included Satchel Paige, Hilton Smith, Quincy Trouppe (who joined the team in early June), and Ted \"Double Duty\" Radcliffe (who joined on June 21 after securing his release from the Brooklyn Eagles).\n\nChurchill was mayor of Bismarck from 1939 to 1946.\n\n"}

Fozzie Bear was created for Jane and Alpha Xi Delta. He originally had pink roses on his bow. The first Kermit the Frog puppet was made out of Alpha Xi Delta curtains. Fozzie Bear was named after Alpha Xi Deltas (Fuzzies).\n\nJane Nebel and Jim Henson worked together on the live 1950s television show \"Sam and Friends\", where Jane collaborated with Jim in performing Muppets and devising several of the show's technical innovations, including the use of television monitors to watch their performances in real time. When, in the late 1950s, Jim took a year off from \"Sam and Friends\" to travel in Europe, Jane ran the show, with the help of a UMD classmate.\n\n\"Among the first of his assignments at WRC was \"Afternoon\", a magazine show aimed at housewives. This marked his first collaboration with Jane Nebel – the woman who later became his wife\" They did not begin dating until Jim returned from Europe where he traveled for several months, to be inspired by European puppeteers who look on their work as an art form. They were married on May 28,1959 at Jane's family home in Salisbury, Maryland.\n\nWhen she quit full-time puppeteering in the early 1960s to raise their children, Jim hired Jerry Juhl and Frank Oz to replace her. She helped the newly hired Frank Oz learn how to lip sync, and continued to perform non-speaking muppets on \"Sesame Street\" from time to time through at least the eighties. She was also responsible for the hiring of puppeteer Steve Whitmire (who would later take over performing Kermit the Frog and Ernie of \"Sesame Street\" after the death of Jim Henson in 1990) in 1978 after he gave her an impromptu audition in an Atlanta, Georgia airport restaurant.\n\nIn 1990, the Henson Company went into an agreement with Disney to present a live stage show: \"Here Come The Muppets\", at Disney/MGM Studio. Jane was the main developer in the training of performers and profile creation for the walk-around versions of the Muppets. She was able to share the Henson spirit of the ten characters that joined Disney at the time: Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the Great, Bean Bunny, as well as five members of the Electric Mayhem Band. \n\nTowards the end of her life, Jane conceived the idea of a stylized puppet show based on the Gospel accounts of the birth of Jesus. Together with a small group of collaborators, she created a live theatre piece featuring tabletop manger figure puppets built by the Jim Henson Creature Shop. Jane Henson's Nativity Story premiered at the 2010 Orlando Puppet Festival. After Henson's death in 2013, vignettes from the stage show were used in the CBS television special \"A New York Christmas to Remember\", narrated by Regis Philbin. A tribute to Henson from family and friends was part of the national broadcast.\n\nJane and Jim Henson married in 1959; they separated in 1986 although they remained close until his death in 1990. In 1992, she established The Jim Henson Legacy to preserve and perpetuate the work of her husband. She served on the boards of the Jim Henson Foundation and the American Center for Children's Television. Jane and Jim Henson had five children: Lisa (born 1960), Cheryl (born 1961), Brian (born 1963), John (1965–2014), and Heather Henson (born 1970).\n\nOn March 20, 2013, her daughter Cheryl revealed that her mother had cancer and was paralyzed; she asked fans to keep Jane in their prayers. Jane Henson died from cancer at the family home in Greenwich, Connecticut on April 2, 2013, at the age of 78. She was cremated. \n"}

{"id": "2304859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304859", "title": "Patentable subject matter", "text": "Patentable subject matter\n\nPatentable, statutory or patent-eligible subject matter is subject matter which is susceptible of patent protection. The laws or patent practices of many countries provide that certain subject-matter is excluded from patentability, even if the invention is novel and non-obvious. Together with novelty, inventive step or nonobviousness, utility, and industrial applicability, the question of whether a particular subject matter is patentable is one of the substantive requirements for patentability.\n\nThe subject-matter which is regarded as patentable as a matter of policy, and correspondingly the subject-matter which is excluded from patentability as a matter of policy, depends on the national legislation or international treaty.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) patents may only be granted for physical embodiments of an idea, or a process that results in something that is tangible or can be sold. This excludes theorems and computer programs per se. However, business methods are patentable.\n\nThe European Patent Convention does not provide any positive guidance on what \"should\" be considered an invention for the purposes of patent law. However, it provides in a non-exhaustive list of what are not to be regarded as inventions, and therefore \"not\" patentable subject matter:\n\n(In a previous EPC version some further items are excluded under , as formally being not industrially applicable, notable medical methods as applied by a physician or a veterinarian. Nowadays these methods are excluded directly under Art. 53 EPC, together with other policy exclusions).\n\nUnder , \"European patents shall be granted for any inventions, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new, involve an inventive step and are susceptible of industrial application.\" So, four questions need to be assessed:\n\nThe first question \"Is there an invention?\" is equivalent to: \"Is the claimed subject-matter as a whole within the realm of patentable subject-matter?\" The invention question or patentable subject-matter question precedes the three further questions, which cannot, and need not, be assessed if there is no invention.\n\nAccording to the case law of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, the question \"Is there an invention?\" also implicitly implies the further question: \"Does the claimed subject-matter have a technical character?\" \"Having technical character is an implicit requirement of the EPC to be met by an invention to be an invention within the meaning of \".\n\nPatentable subject-matter considerations also intervene again at a secondary level, during the inventive step assessment. In T 641/00 (Comvik/Two Identities), the Board held that, \"An invention consisting of a mixture of technical and non-technical features and having technical character as a whole is to be assessed with respect to the requirement of inventive step by taking account of all those features which contribute to said technical character whereas features making no such contribution cannot support the presence of inventive step.\" The non-technical features are the ones that are excluded from the realm of patentable subject-matter as a matter of policy. T 258/03 (Hitachi/Auction Method) further developed this test for patentable subject-matter.\n\nUnder this test, a patent application or patent which does not provide a technical solution to a technical problem would be refused (under ) or revoked (under ) as lacking inventive step.\n\nThe European Patent Office provides guidelines for evaluating the patent-eligibility of computer-implemented inventions (CII), such as in particular based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). For instance, AI-based image processing programs are considered technical and therefore patent-eligible. Conversely, AI-based text processing programs with a text classification only based on the content of the text are not considered technical. These are excluded from patentability because attaching meaning to words is a cognitive task and not a technical implementation.\n\nFollowing the 2006 Court of Appeal judgment in Aerotel v Telco and Macrossan's application, which contains a lengthy discussion of case law in the area, the UKPO has adopted the following test:\n\nThe Court decided that the new approach provided a structured and more helpful way of applying the statutory test for assessing patentability which was consistent with previous decisions of the Court.\n\nThis test is quite different from the test used by the EPO, as expressed in T 641/00 (Comvik/Two Identities) and T 258/03 (Hitachi/Auction Method), but it is considered that the end result will be the same in nearly every case.\n\nSection 101 of Title 35 U.S.C. sets out the subject matter that can be patented:\n\nIn October 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued interim guidelines for patent examiners to determine if a given claimed invention meets the statutory requirements of being a useful process, manufacture, composition of matter or machine (). These guidelines assert that a process, including a process for doing business, must produce a concrete, useful and tangible result to be patentable. It does not matter whether the process is within the traditional technological arts or not. A price for a financial product, for example, is considered to be a concrete useful and tangible result (see \"State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group\"). However, on August 24, 2009, the USPTO issued new interim guidelines so that examination would comport with the Federal Circuit opinion in In re Bilski, which held that the \"useful, concrete, and tangible\" test for patent-eligibility is incorrect and that \"State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group\" is no longer valid legal authority on this point. Instead, the Federal Circuit and the new USPTO guidelines use a machine-or-transformation test to determine patentability for processes. The Supreme Court determined that the claims in the Bilski case covered non-statutory subject matter as it was too abstract and broad.\n\nThe USPTO has reasserted its position that literary works, compositions of music, compilations of data, legal documents (such as insurance policies), and forms of energy (such as data packets transmitted over the Internet), are not considered \"manufactures\" and hence, by themselves, are not patentable. Nonetheless, the USPTO has requested comments from the public on this position. The Federal Circuit has ruled, in \"In re Nuijten\", that signals are not statutory subject matter, because articles of manufacture (the only plausible category under ) do not include intangible, incorporeal, transitory entities.\n\nThe USPTO was prompted to issue the guidelines by a recent decision by their board of appeals, \"Ex Parte Lundgren\". This decision asserted that according to US judicial opinions, inventions do not have to be in the \"technological arts\" to satisfy the requirements of . They must, however, produce a concrete, useful and tangible result. As indicated above, however, \"In re Bilski\" supersedes that legal test (as to the \"useful, concrete, and tangible\" test). The \"Bilski\" majority opinion also rejects the \"technological arts\" test, although three Federal Circuit judges (Mayer, dissenting, and Dyk and Linn, concurring) stated that they considered being technological an indispensable condition of patent-eligibility.\n\nOn May 22, 2019, in Washington D.C. a bipartisan, bicameral draft bill that would reform Section 101 of the Patent Act was introduced. It was proposed by the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) and its Ranking Member, Senator Chris Coons (D-DE). They were joined by the House of Representatives Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, Hank Johnson (D-GA-4), the Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and the Courts, and Representative Steve Stivers (R-OH-15) The proposal was released prior to a round-table the Senators and Representatives were holding the following day and intended to solicit feedback.\n\nThe Alice Supreme Court reduced the patent-eligibility of software patents or patents on software for business methods, excluding abstract ideas from the list of eligible subject matters. After much confusion within the patent examiners and patent practitioners, the USPTO prepared a list of examples of software patent claims that are deemed patent-eligible or not.\n\nThe exception to patenting algorithms arose out of three Supreme Court cases commonly referred to as the \"Supreme Court Trilogy\" or \"patent-eligibility trilogy\". This is a designation for three Supreme Court cases (\"Gottschalk v. Benson\", \"Parker v. Flook\", and \"Diamond v. Diehr\") decided within a decade on whether, and in what circumstances, a claimed invention was within the scope of the US patent system (that is, was eligible to be considered for a patent grant). The three cases of the trilogy can be harmonized on the basis of when a claimed implementation of an idea or principle is old or departs from the prior art in only a facially trivial way, the claim is patent-ineligible (as \"Nielson\" and \"Morse\" said, and \"Flook\" reaffirmed, it must be treated as if in the prior art).\n\nThe invention in this case was a method of programming a general-purpose digital computer using an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal numbers into pure binary numbers. The Supreme Court noted that phenomena of nature, mental processes and abstract intellectual concepts were not patentable, since they were the basic tools of scientific and technological work. However, new and useful inventions derived from such discoveries are patentable. The Court found that the discovery in \"Benson\" was unpatentable since the invention, an algorithm, was no more than abstract mathematics. Despite this holding, the Court emphasized that its decision did not preclude computer software from being patented, but rather precluded the patentability of software where the only useful characteristic was an algorithm. The Court further noted that validating this type of patent would foreclose all future use of the algorithm in question. Therefore, like the traditional exceptions to patentable subject matter, the purpose of the algorithm exception was to encourage development of new technologies by not granting patents that would preclude others from using abstract mathematical principles.\n\nThe invention in this case was a method of calculating alarm limits by using a \"smoothing algorithm\" to make the system responsive to trends but not momentary fluctuations in process variables (such as temperature). Because it was conceded that the implementation of the algorithm was conventional, the Court found that the inventor did not even purport to have invented anything on which a patent could be granted. The Court did so on the basis of the principle that the nonstatutory subject matter (the algorithm) must be regarded as already in the prior art. Therefore, there was nothing left on which a patent could issue. In a case in which a patent was sought on an implementation of a principle (the algorithm), the implementation itself must be inventive for a patent to issue. Since that was not so, the Court held that the patent office had properly rejected Flook's claim to a patent. The Court relied on the decision in \"Neilson v. Harford\", an English case that the Supreme Court had relied upon in \"O'Reilly v. Morse\", for the proposition that an idea or principle must be treated as if it were already in the prior art, irrespective of whether it was actually new or old. This approach is something like that of analytic dissection in computer-software copyright law, although its use in patent law preceded its use in copyright law by a century or more.\n\nIn this case the Court backed away from the analytic dissection approach, and insisted that patent-eligibility must be decided on the basis of the claim (or invention) considered as a whole. The requirement of bypassing analytic dissection is found in the statute, but only for section 103 (governing obviousness or inventive step) and not for section 101 (governing patent-eligibility). Despite this difference in emphasis, however, \"Diehr\" can be harmonized with \"Flook\" and \"Benson\", and the \"Diehr\" Court studiously avoided stating that \"Flook\" and \"Benson\" were overruled or limited.\n\nOn June 28, 2010, the United States Supreme Court ruled in \"Bilski v. Kappos\" that Bernard Bilski's patent application for a method of hedging the seasonal risks of buying energy is an abstract idea and is therefore unpatentable. However, it also said that business methods are not inherently unpatentable, and was silent on the subject of software patents. The majority opinion also said that the Federal Circuit's \"machine or transformation\" test, while useful, is not an exclusive test for determining the patentability of a process. Instead, the Supreme Court reviewed the \"Supreme Court Trilogy\" described above and said that future decisions should be grounded in the examples and concepts expressed in those opinions. As has been reported, the decision leaves many questions unanswered, including the patentability of many medical diagnostic technologies and software. In May 2013, the Federal Circuit handed down an en banc decision in CLS Bank v. Alice applying the various concepts in the \"Supreme Court Trilogy\". The claims at issue were found unpatentable by a narrow margin, but the differences in positions of the various judges on the panel were dramatic and not definitive.\n\nOn March 20, 2012, the United States Supreme Court ruled in \"Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.\" that a process patent, which Prometheus Laboratories had obtained for correlations between blood test results and patient health in determining an appropriate dosage of a specific medication for the patient, is not eligible for a patent because the correlation is a law of nature. The court reasoned “the steps in the claimed processes (aside from the natural laws themselves) involve well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by researchers in the field.” The decision has been criticized for conflating two separate patent law concepts (patent eligibility under Section 101 and obviousness for patentability under Section 103), and potentially invalidating many patents relating to the biotech, medical diagnostics and pharmaceutical industries. Others, such as the American Medical Association (AMA), praised the decision for invalidating patents that would have hampered the ability of physicians to provide quality patient care. Under Section 287(c) of the Patent Act, however, a claim of patent infringement cannot be maintained against a medical practitioner for performing a medical activity, or against a related health care entity with respect to such medical activity, unless the medical practitioner is working in a clinical diagnostic laboratory.\n\nOn June 16, 1980, the United States Supreme Court ruled in \"Diamond v. Chakrabarty\" that a living non-naturally genetically modified bacterium is patent eligible as a composition of matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101, which provides for the issuance of a patent to a person who invents or discovers \"any\" new and useful \"manufacture\" or \"composition of matter.\" As a result of the ruling, the patented invention included claims drawn to a non-naturally occurring bacterium that was genetically modified to be capable of degrading hydrocarbons. This ruling set the precedent for animate material as patentable subject matter.\n\nThe question of what should and should not be patentable subject matter has spawned a number of battlegrounds in recent years, setting against each other those in each area supporting patentability, claiming that patents would cause increased innovation and public good, against opponents with views that patentability is being sought only for private good but would do public harm.\n\nFlashpoints have included the patenting of naturally occurring biological material, genetic sequences, stem cells, \"traditional knowledge,\" programs for computers, and business methods.\n\nIn March 2010, a federal district court judge in the Southern District of New York ruled against Myriad Genetics and in favor of the American Civil Liberties Union that purified DNA sequences and the inventions using them are unpatentable. As has been discussed, Judge Sweet relied entirely upon Supreme Court precedent and ignored contrary case law of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to conclude that isolated DNA is of the same fundamental quality as natural DNA and is thus unpatentable under section 101 of the Patent Act; and that the method claims of the patents were abstract mental processes that were also unpatentable. His rationale was controversial and his ruling was appealed to the Federal Circuit. The appeal court reversed the ruling deciding that isolated DNA had a \"markedly different chemical structure\" from other human genetic material. In 2013 The US Supreme Court partly reversed the decision again deciding that DNA was not patentable, Justice Antonin Scalia writing \"the portion of the DNA isolated from its natural state sought to be patented is identical to that portion of the DNA in its natural state\". However, the Supreme Court also decided that complementary DNA can be patented because it is not naturally occurring. When the news was announced ACLU welcomed the decision and Myriad Genetics share prices rose.\n\nIn October 2015, the High Court of Australia ruled against Myriad Genetics, holding that a mutated gene associated with susceptibility to breast cancer cannot give rise to a patentable invention under Australian law.\n\n\n\n"}

Harry Altham wrote of him in \"A History of Cricket\", \"Maurice Read had been recognised as a dashing player up to Test Match form, to say nothing of being a wonderful fielder in the country.\" A hard-hitting and, according to Lord Hawke, \"magnificent batsman who never had pretensions to be even a moderate change bowler\", Read did little bowling except in 1883, when he claimed 27 first-class wickets including his career best of 6–41 against Kent.\n\nBorn in 1859 in Thames Ditton, Surrey, Read joined the Thames Ditton Cricket Club in 1879, made his first-class debut for Surrey in 1880, and played regularly for his county for fifteen years. His most productive year was 1886, when he scored 1,364 runs at an average of 34.97, including two centuries and seven fifties. He was also extremely productive in the first half of 1889, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1890, but his season was affected later in the year by a bad finger injury.\n\nRead made his debut in the Oval (his home ground) Test Match against Australia in 1882, the match famous for bringing about the Ashes. According to the \"Manchester Guardian\", Read's selection \"was admittedly something of an experiment. He has played two or three lucky innings lately, but these do not make a cricketer any more than two or three swallows make a summer.\" A week or so prior the Test, however, Read had shared in a 158-run partnership against the tourists with fellow professional and England player Billy Barnes. Read finished on 130 and, like most of his team-mates, went into the match in good form.\n\nIn England's first innings, the local boy was cheered all the way to the middle by an avid Oval crowd. Fred Spofforth, however, soon walloped the hero three excruciating blows — one in the ribs, another on the knee and one more on the elbow. Read was compelled to hold up the game on two of these occasions to take time to convalesce, and it was, by all reports, an exceptionally valiant knock. Read finished unbeaten on nineteen, the second-best score of the innings, and the masses cheered him all the way back to the pavilion. There are copious examples in this match which serve to support Altham's affirmation that Read was \"a wonderful fielder in the country\" (i.e. outfield). He is frequently recorded in contemporary accounts of the game as chasing the ball down as fast as he could, and he certainly managed to bring to a halt plenty of potential Australian boundaries.\n\nIn the second innings, Read was one of the many victims of England captain Monkey Hornby's spectacular alteration of the batting order, promoted in front of the apparently nerveless CT Studd. When he came into view from the pavilion, Read was again cheered stridently all the way to the wicket, but, when Spofforth bowled him for a duck, the Australians were the ones, wrote Charles Pardon in \"Bell's Life\", who \"exhibited to the full their increasing delight\". This was the game which launched the legend of The Ashes after the Australians won by seven runs.\n\nWhen he came back to Australia in 1886/87, Read was flabbergasted at the pickiness of the Australian public, and he wrote of it: \"If you have a bit of bad luck and make nothing two or three times, you are not of much account in Australia, and out of the team you should go, even if you have scored excellently on occasions.\" In England, however, it was different. \"There,\" he reckoned, \"if you are a recognised player, half a dozen successive noughts will not exclude you from a team.\"\n\nRead remained a regular selection for England until 1893, being awarded that year's Oval Test (against South Africa) as a benefit. Although his batting at this level was not spectacular – he passed fifty only twice in his 29 Test innings – his fielding at third man was excellent. He also appeared for the Players against the Gentlemen on 17 occasions.\n\nGeorge Lohmann, for one, preferred watching Read (and even AE Stoddart) to Arthur Shrewsbury, the man whom WG Grace placed second only to himself. Indeed, Read and Lohmann were extremely good friends, and they even shared a few personal jokes. (\"Look out!\" Lohmann would say to Read; \"I'm going to bowl at the sticks now!\"—and Read would watch with amusement as his comrade sent down all manner of strange deliveries to tempt the batsman into hitting out.)\n\nRead was sent along to South Africa with Lohmann in 1892 to be of assistance to the great bowler in his recuperation following a ghastly (but altogether foreseeable) physical collapse as a result of overbowling. The pair sailed from Southampton on Christmas Eve, and, in March 1893, when Lohmann was healthy enough to be left on his own, Read made his homecoming for the start of the new season. (Lohmann later broke down again, however, eventually dying in South Africa.)\n\nIncidentally, another colleague of Read's who suffered the effects of being overbowled was Tom Richardson, a Surrey and Thames Ditton team-mate. Read was one of the first to forecast what would eventually happen to this great fast bowler, conjecturing ominously about the strenuous effects that the 1897/98 tour might have on Richardson's body. He was, of course, proven correct.\n\nAfter scoring 131 to help Surrey defeat Hampshire by an innings in 1895, Read retired from first-class cricket at the age of 36 – relatively young by 19th century standards – to work on the Tichborne Park estate in Hampshire, although he continued to bat with great success in minor cricket for the Tichborne side for some years thereafter, scoring hundreds in successive weekends in 1921 (v Martyn Worthey and Kilmeston) He died at the age of 70 in Winchester after a long illness. George Giffen called him \"one of the most genuine cricketers I met\".\n\nRead's uncle (by marriage) Heathfield Stephenson had a long career with Surrey, and his brother Frederick Read also played one first-class game for the county.\n\n"}
{"id": "2304871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304871", "title": "Kite shield", "text": "Kite shield\n\nA kite shield is a large, almond-shaped shield rounded at the top and curving down to a point or rounded point at the bottom. The term \"kite shield\" is a reference to the shield's unique shape, and is derived from its supposed similarity to a flying kite, although \"leaf-shaped shield\" and \"almond shield\" have also been used in recent literature. Since the most prominent examples of this shield have appeared on the Bayeux Tapestry, the kite shield has become closely associated with Norman warfare.\n\nThe first known illustration of a kite shield appeared in the Gospels of Otto III, made between 983 and 991, indicating it was in use with Western European armies by the late tenth century. The shield was developed for mounted cavalry, and its dimensions correlate to the approximate space between a horse's neck and its rider's thigh. A narrow bottom protected the rider's left leg, and the pronounced upper curve, the rider's shoulder and torso. This was a vast improvement over more common circular shields, such as bucklers, which afforded poor protection to the horseman's left flank, especially when he was charging with a lance. Though their great length and unwieldy nature made them cumbersome and inconvenient for foot soldiers, kite shields nevertheless gained popularity, spreading throughout Western Europe during the 1000s. In the Bayeux Tapestry, most of the English are depicted on foot with kite shields, while a minority still use round shields. Aside from Normandy, they also appeared early on in parts of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. It is unclear from which of these three regions the design originated. A common theory is that the kite shield was inherited by the Normans from their Viking predecessors. However, no documentation or remains of kite shields from the Viking era have been discovered, and they were not ideally suited to the Vikings' highly mobile light infantry. Kite shields were depicted primarily on eleventh century illustrations, largely in Western Europe and the Byzantine Empire, but also in the Caucasus, the Fatimid Caliphate, and among the Kievan Rus'. For example, an eleventh century silver engraving of Saint George recovered from Bochorma, Georgia, depicts a kite shield, as do other isolated pieces of Georgian art dating to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Kite shields also appear on the Bab al-Nasr in Cairo, which was constructed around 1087. Arab historians usually described them as \"tariqa\" or \"januwiyya\".\n\nAround the mid to late twelfth century, traditional kite shields were largely replaced by a variant in which the top was flat, rather than rounded. This change made it easier for a soldier to hold the shield upright without limiting his field of vision. Flat-topped kite shields were later phased out by most Western European armies in favour of much smaller, more compact \"heater shields\". However, they were still being carried by Byzantine infantrymen well into the thirteenth century.\n\nTo compensate for their awkward nature, kite shields were equipped with enarmes, which gripped the shield tightly to the arm and facilitated keeping it in place even when a knight relaxed his arm; this was a significant departure from most earlier circular shields, which possessed only a single handle. Some examples were apparently also fitted with an additional guige strap that allowed the shield to be slung over one shoulder when not in use. Byzantine soldiers frequently carried kite shields on their backs, sometimes upside down. At the time of the First Crusade, most kite shields were still fitted with a domed metal centrepiece (shield boss), although the use of enarmes would have rendered them unnecessary. It is possible that shields may have been fitted with both enarmes and an auxiliary hand grip.\n\nA typical kite shield was at least three feet high, being constructed of laminated wood, stretched animal hide, and iron components. Records from Byzantium in the 1200s suggests that the shield frame accounted for most of the wood and iron; its body was constructed out of hide, parchment, or hardened leather, similar to the material used on drum faces.\n\n\n"}

His father, William White, a member of the Nonconformist community of the Bunyan Meeting, became well known as a doorkeeper at the House of Commons and wrote sketches of parliamentary life for the \"Illustrated Times\". A selection of his parliamentary sketches was published posthumously, in 1897, by Justin McCarthy, the Irish nationalist MP, as \"The Inner Life of the House of Commons\".\n\nWhite himself was educated at Bedford Modern School until the family moved to London. There he was trained for the Congregational ministry, but the development of his views prevented his taking up that career; the same unconventional views got him expelled from New College, London, and he eventually became a clerk at the Admiralty. In 1861 he began writing newspaper articles to increase his income, having met and married Harriet Arthur and started a family.\n\nHe had already served an apprenticeship to journalism before he made his name, or rather his pen name, \"Mark Rutherford\", famous with three novels, supposedly edited by one Reuben Shapcott: \"The Autobiography of Mark Rutherford\" (1881), \"Mark Rutherford's Deliverance\" (1885) and \"The Revolution in Tanner's Lane\" (1887).\n\nUnder his own name White translated \"Spinoza's Ethics\" (1883).

{"id": "2304886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304886", "title": "Green ban", "text": "Green ban\n\nA green ban is a form of strike action, usually taken by a trade union or other organised labour group, which is conducted for environmentalist or conservationist purposes. They were mainly done in Australia in the 1970s, led by the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) and used to protect parkland, low-income housing and buildings with historical significance.\n\nGreen bans were first conducted in Australia in the 1970s by the New South Wales Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). Green bans were never instigated unilaterally by the BLF, all green bans were at the request of, and in support of, residents' groups. The first green ban was put in place to protect Kelly's Bush, the last remaining undeveloped bushland in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. A group of local women who had already appealed to the local council, mayor, and the Premier of New South Wales, approached the BLF for help. The BLF asked the women to call a public meeting, which was attended by 600 residents, and formally asked the BLF to prevent construction on the site. The developer, A V Jennings, announced that they would use non-union labour as strikebreakers. In response, BLF members on other A V Jennings construction projects stopped work. A V Jennings eventually abandoned all plans to develop Kelly's Bush. Jack Mundey summarised the philosophy of the Green Bans as such:\"Yes, we want to build. However, we prefer to build urgently-required hospitals, schools, other public utilities, high-quality flats, units and houses, provided they are designed with adequate concern for the environment, than to build ugly unimaginative architecturally-bankrupt blocks of concrete and glass offices... Though we want all our members employed, we will not just become robots directed by developer-builders who value the dollar at the expense of the environment. More and more, we are going to determine which buildings we will build... The environmental interests of three million people are at stake and cannot be left to developers and building employers whose main concern is making profit. Progressive unions, like ours, therefore have a very useful social role to play in the citizens' interest, and we intend to play it.\"The BLF was involved in many more green bans. Not only did the BLF represent all unionised builders' labourers in the construction industry; but the BLF also influenced the opinion of other unionised construction workers, and acted as a political leadership of the construction unions in the era. Fifty-four bans were imposed in NSW between 1971 and 1974. Green bans helped to protect historic nineteenth century buildings in The Rocks from being demolished to make way for office towers, and prevented the Royal Botanic Gardens from being turned into a carpark for the Sydney Opera House. The BLF stopped conducting green bans in 1974 after the federal leadership under Norm Gallagher dismissed the leaders of the New South Wales branch.\n\nOne of the last bans to be removed was to prevent development of Victoria Street in the suburb of Potts Point. This ban involved hundreds of residents, trade union members, and other activists and was successful for a number of years, despite facing a well-connected developer who employed thugs to harass residents. Arthur King, the head of the residents' action group, was kidnapped in 1973. It was suspected, though never proved, that the men who kidnapped him had been hired by the property developer, Frank Theeman. The New South Wales Police collaborated with Theeman and his employees during the ban and eventually carried out a forced mass eviction of squatters and residents, which saw squatters barricade themselves in a siege for 2 days. The green ban was broken in 1974 when the conservative federal leadership of the BLF, under pressure from New South Wales politicians, dismissed the leaders of the New South Wales branch, and replaced them with more conservative people who did not support the ban. Activists, led by activist, resident, and journalist Juanita Nielsen, then convinced another union, the Water Board Employees Union, to impose a ban which was continued for some time. Nielsen was then kidnapped and murdered in 1975. The struggle ended with a stand-off in 1977. The developer had been forced to alter his plans, but the residents had been forced out.\n\nAlthough green bans have been implemented on a number of occasions since the 1970s, they have not been so prevalent, nor so comprehensive in their effect. One estimate of the effect of the BLF's green bans puts the amount of development prevented at A$3 billion between 1971 and 1974 (approximately A$25 billion ). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 1973, Jack Mundey coined the term \"green ban\" to distinguish them from the traditional union \"black bans\". Mundey argued that the term \"green ban\" was more appropriate as they were in defence of the environment. Green bans saved many vital urban spaces and over 100 buildings were considered by the National Trust to be worthy of preservation.\n\nAnother example of a green ban in Sydney was the proposed North-Western Expressway that was planned by the Department of Main Roads in the early 1970s. The expressway would have cut through the working class residential areas of Ultimo, Glebe, Annandale, Rozelle and Leichhardt. In July 1972, the Save Lyndhurst Committee requested a green ban from the Builders Labourers' Federation to prevent the destruction of historic Lyndhurst (built 1833-1835) in Darghan Street, Glebe. Many battles with police took place, including a confrontation between police and squatters on 18 August 1972. The Federal Labor Whitlam Government purchased the Glebe estate in 1973 from the Anglican Diocese of Glebe to preserve the area. In 1978, the Wran-Labor Government decided to abandon much of the inner-urban expressway link and the 19th century character of Glebe remains intact.\n\nGreen bans influenced local NSW planning structures as well as national planning systems. \"The Green ban movement in Sydney and Melbourne of the early 1970s, led by the Builder Labourers Federation, was the most profound external indication of the need for planning reform.\" In 1977 an editorial from the Australian quoted \"bans were an inevitable result of official attitudes which regarded people as irrelevant factors to development\". He also indicated that the decision making process then was devoid of appropriate involvement by relevant communities and individuals.\n\nDuring the movement infamous redevelopment projects were discarded or scale down, and the planning reform finally began. The previously confined approach to land use planning, due to a \"paradigm meltdown\", started to incorporate concerns from community. On one hand, new historical buildings legislations were founded in the 1970s across several states, and on the other the ground legislation of the current planning system\n\nThe green bans in the 1970s initiated a democratic National and State planning systems in which heritage as well as environmentally significant sites became a part of a development proposal. 'In 1997 the Director of the Urban Research Unit of the Australian National University, stated that the green bans of the New South Wales Builders Labourers' Federation (NSW BLF) had a \"subtle influence\" in transforming the culture of urban planning in ways that now evince greater sensitivity to environmental concerns, better appreciation of heritage, the need to publicise proposed developments well in advance and to seek approval from the people affected'. Similar union bans were started in other cities in Australia including Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra and Hobart however to a lesser level than Sydney. The green ban movement became a powerful tool of influencing city developments by involving the wider community to sign petitions in order to prevent destruction of a heritage or environmentally significant sites. \nUltimately, the green bans led to the Wran government introducing two acts, Firstly the Heritage legislation- The Heritage Act 1977 and secondly Environmental Planning and Assessment Act (EP&A) 1979.\n\nAlthough green bans were conducted for only three to four years in Australia, they influenced international politics significantly because this movement is considered to have contributed to the integration of the word \"green\" into the world's political idioms.\n\nThe German politician Petra Kelly came to Australia around the middle of the 1970s and witnessed green bans opposing undesirable development in Sydney by the cooperation between the BLF and local citizens. She was very impressed with this movement, the connection accomplished between environmentalists and the BLF, and the success they made in many campaigns. It is also known that she often stated that green bans had a great impact on both herself and her philosophy. Subsequently, she brought back the idea of green bans as well as the terminology \"green\" to Germany, and established the German Green Party in 1979. This is regarded as the point at which the word \"green\" was first applied to politics in Europe. Petra Kelly acknowledged that Australian green bans broadened the possibilities of the environmental movement as well as gave it a new dimension, and they made it possible to involve a much broader range of the population in environmental groups and ecological actions. Therefore, green bans in Australia were significant events not only locally and nationally but also internationally.\n\n\n"}

The southbound train departed at 7:55 PM and arrived at 9:00 AM the next day. The California Department of Transportation, Caltrans, budgeted $1.7 million towards the train's first year of operation and expected 160,000 passengers the first year, rising to 300,000 in five years. The train carried coaches, a cafe, and two sleeping cars. Service began on October 25, 1981. Caltrans held a naming contest, with the winner \"Spirit of California\" announced on December 24.\n\nAfter taking office in January 1983, Governor George Deukmejian cut funding for the train, and Amtrak supporters scrambled to find additional funding. It was proposed that the state of Nevada fund the train for service to Reno, but this proposal was never passed by the Nevada legislature. The \"Spirit of California\" was discontinued in 1983, running for the final time on the night of September 30–October 1, 1983.\n\nThe \"Spirit of California\"'s usual consist was:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2304915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304915", "title": "Gentlemen v Players", "text": "Gentlemen v Players\n\nGentlemen v Players was a long-running series of English first-class cricket matches, between teams consisting of amateur (Gentlemen) and professional cricketers (Players). Two matches were played in 1806, but the fixture was not repeated until 1819. Thereafter it was played most years between 1819 and 1962, typically twice each summer.\n\nThe distinction between the two teams arose from the English class structure of the 19th century: originally the Players were working class cricketers who earned their living through the game, whilst the Gentlemen were middle- and upper-class, usually products of the public school system, who played cricket for leisure. Whereas the Players were paid wages by their county clubs or fees by match organisers, the Gentlemen nominally only claimed expenses. Rules to distinguish amateurs from professionals were established by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The system of allowable expenses was controversial; some leading amateurs were paid more for playing cricket than any professional.\n\nThe fixture struggled to gain public interest during the mid-19th century, as the Players often easily defeated the Gentlemen. Various efforts to improve competitiveness were tried, including different-sized wickets for each team and a system of 'given men', in which the Players would loan one or more of their best players to the Gentlemen. These were generally unsuccessful, with the Players continuing to win most matches. The fixtures became more competitive and gained prestige in the late 1800s, coinciding with the career of W. G. Grace, who played for the Gentlemen with great success. During the period 1860–1914, the fixture was seen as one of the highlights of the cricket season.\n\nThe increasing popularity of international Test cricket (which began in 1877) saw interest in Gentlemen v Players begin to decline, a process accelerated by the weakening of the social class system in the 20th century. After the Second World War, the concepts of amateurism and selecting teams based on social class were seen as increasingly anachronistic. In 1963, the MCC abolished amateur status, causing all first-class cricketers to become professionals. As the official distinction between the teams no longer existed, the Gentlemen v Players fixture was discontinued. No direct substitute was implemented, instead England's first domestic one day cricket competition began that summer.\n\nA total of 274 Gentlemen v Players matches were held from 1806–1962, with the Players winning 125 and the Gentlemen 68; there were 80 draws and one tie.\n\nAt its height from the 1860s until 1914, the fixture was a prestigious one, though in terms of quality it fell far short of Test matches and even of the rival North v. South fixture. Until the 1860s, the Gentlemen teams were often very weak compared with the professionals, and on occasion the fixture had to be arranged on an odds basis, so that the Players eleven took on a greater number of Gentlemen. The Gentlemen famously became competitive during the career of W. G. Grace, whose performances were so outstanding that the Gentlemen could enjoy some long-awaited success. The fixture often confirmed the commonly held view of an imbalance between amateur and professional in that amateurs tended to be batsmen first and foremost, hence there were few good amateur bowlers. The Players could nearly always field a strong bowling side.\n\nThe game was played over three days on all but a handful of occasions throughout its history. The most frequent venue for the match was Lord's, but a number of other grounds were used, notably The Oval and Scarborough, and it was at Scarborough that the last Gentlemen v Players game was played, in September 1962.\n\nThe same format of amateurs playing professionals was used in a number of other fixtures, some of which were given first-class status (for example, \"Gentlemen of Nottinghamshire v Players of Nottinghamshire\"), but these matches became less common after the beginning of the 20th century, and the last such game was \"Gentlemen of the South v Players of the South\" in 1920, after which all first-class Gentlemen v Players matches were between teams known simply by those names.\n\nThe Gentlemen v Players series ended after the 1962 season, when the distinction between amateur and professional players was abolished. Charles Williams has described several reports on the subject which were submitted to MCC by its Amateur Status Standing Committee (ASSC) and, on 31 January 1963, the MCC committee unanimously agreed to abolish amateurism. Williams says a substitute fixture was sought but it was decided not to pursue this as the new Gillette Cup limited overs competition was beginning in 1963.\n\nThere were contrasting views about the end of amateurism and the passing of Gentlemen v Players. Some traditionalists like E. W. Swanton and the editor of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" \"lamented the passing of an era\" but social change had rendered the whole concept an anachronism and Fred Trueman spoke for many when he summarised amateurism as a \"ludicrous business\" that was \"thankfully abolished\" after the 1962 season.\n\nThe inaugural fixture was a three-day match at the original Lord's ground from 7 to 9 July 1806. It was soon followed by the second, held on the same ground from 21 to 25 July. In the first match, the Gentlemen played with two \"given men\" and these were the two outstanding professionals of the day, Billy Beldham and William Lambert. Lambert made a significant contribution with the bat and the Gentlemen won by an innings and 14 runs. For the return, the Gentlemen retained Lambert. Beldham played for the Players. The Gentlemen won a low-scoring game by 82 runs and Lambert was again a significant factor, although the leading amateur Lord Frederick Beauclerk made two good scores. A curiosity of these matches is that they featured the veteran professional Tom Walker and the rookie amateur John Willes. These are the two players both credited with devising the roundarm style of bowling, but there is no evidence to suggest they used roundarm in 1806.\n\nDescribed by H. S. Altham as the \"most famous of all domestic matches\", the fixture disappeared until 1819. Altham says he does not know why but the Napoleonic Wars must have been a factor as cricket was in decline from 1810 until after Waterloo in 1815. In 1819, the amateurs agreed to play the professionals on equal terms but lost by six wickets. There was only one run between the sides on first innings but the Gentlemen collapsed in the second against the bowling of Tom Howard and John Sherman to be all out for only 60. This match was held at the \"new\" Lord's ground, the present one, which had opened in 1814. The fourth match was played at Lord's in June 1820 and the Gentlemen, now with star bowler Howard as a given man, won by 70 runs.\n\nThe fifth match earned notoriety. It was scheduled to be played at Lord's from 23 to 25 July 1821 but ended on the second day after the Gentlemen conceded. Known as the \"Coronation Match\" because it celebrated the accession of the unpopular George IV it was described by Derek Birley as \"a suitably murky affair\". The Gentlemen had batted first and were quickly dismissed for 60. Then they had to spend a long time in the field through most of the first and second days while the Players steadily built a big lead. At 270 for six, the Gentlemen decided to \"give up\" and the match ended.\n\nAfter this, the fixture struggled for many years to regain credibility. In twelve of the fourteen matches played from 1824 to 1837, the Players were handicapped, usually by the Gentlemen having extra men. In one match the Gentlemen had eighteen and in two more seventeen. In 1832, the Gentlemen defended a smaller-than-normal wicket of 22 by 6 inches and in 1837, in what became known as the \"Barn Door Match\", the Players defended an outsize wicket of four stumps measuring 36 by 12 inches.\n\nThe tide turned somewhat in the 1840s when Alfred Mynn and Nicholas Felix were playing for the amateurs. In nine equal terms matches from 1842 to 1849, the Gentlemen won six against two for the Players and one drawn. That run of success ended and, apart from a solitary victory in 1853 and one draw in 1862, the Gentlemen lost every one of the next 25 games up to July 1865.\n\nAccording to Harry Altham, the period from about 1860 into the 1880s were the \"halcyon days of amateur cricket\". This refers in part to the success of cricketers who came through the public schools and universities in the period but in the main to the achievements of Gentlemen teams who won 27 matches against the Players whilst losing only five. The key figure in this remarkable turnaround was W. G. Grace. Altham says that \"the pendulum of power\" had swung in the amateur direction and \"never again was it found pointing so unequivocally to (amateur supremacy)\".\n\nSocial change after the Second World War led to a reaction against the concept of amateurism in English cricket and in 1963 all first-class cricketers became nominally professional as, in effect, \"Players\". The last edition of the Gentlemen v Players fixture was played 8, 10 and 11 September 1962 at Scarborough – the Players, under the captaincy of Fred Trueman, won by 7 wickets. The events leading to the abolition of amateurism are described by Charles Williams in his book, \"Gentlemen & Players\", appropriately subtitled \"The Death of Amateurism in Cricket\".\n\nIn all 274 matches were played. The Gentlemen won 68 and the Players 125. 80 matches were drawn and the first match of 1883 ended in a tie. The results of all the matches may be found in List of Gentlemen v Players matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Alter was 13 when he began playing piano in theaters showing silent films. He studied at the New England Conservatory of Music under the tutelage of Stuart Mason.\n\nHe was born on June 18, 1902, in Haverhill, Massachusetts.\n\nAlter played in vaudeville houses as the accompanist for headliners Irène Bordoni and Nora Bayes. He appeared with Bayes from 1924 until her death in 1928, touring the United States and abroad. Since he had previously written some songs for Broadway shows, Alter decided to concentrate on songwriting after Bayes' death. His first hit was \"Manhattan Serenade\" (1929), originally an instrumental that later became the theme music of the \"Easy Aces\" radio program. There are numerous recordings of \"Manhattan Serenade,\" and it was featured prominently in Nancy Groce's book, \"New York: Songs of the City\" (Watson-Guptill, 1999). Alter recalled:\n\nIn 1929, Alter moved to Hollywood, where he wrote songs for films, beginning with \"The Hollywood Review of 1929\", and he continued to provide piano accompaniment for various singers, including Beatrice Lillie and Helen Morgan. His contributions to Broadway musicals included songs in \"Sweet and Low\" (1930) and \"Ballyhoo\" (1931).\n\nHis first song hit was \"Hugs and Kisses\" in 1926. In 1928, Alter composed the music and wrote the lyrics of Paris (1928 musical). Other top tunes by Alter include \"My Kinda Love,\" \"You Turned the Tables on Me,\" \"Nina Never Knew,\" \"Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans\" (for the 1947 film \"New Orleans\"), \"Blue Shadows\" and \"Rainbow on the River.\" He wrote \"A Melody from the Sky\" and \"Twilight on the Trail\" for \"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\" (1936). His collaborators included Oscar Hammerstein II, Charlotte Kent, Raymond Klages, Sidney D. Mitchell, and Jo Trent.\n\nIn 1941, Alter signed on with the United States Air Force, performing for troops and also coordinating shows and other entertainment at various West Coast air bases. As a piano soloist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he performed at the Hollywood Bowl. In 1942, \"Manhattan Serenade\" once again became a hit after Harold Adamson added lyrics.\n\nAlter also composed large-scale pieces for piano and orchestra, including \"American Serenade\" and \"Metropolitan Nocturne\". In later years, Alter lived in New York and maintained a summer residence on Fire Island.\n\nTwice nominated for Academy Awards (\"Dolores,\" \"A Melody from the Sky\"), he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1975.\n\nHe died on November 5, 1980 at age 78, of pneumonia at Saint Clare's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, his song \"Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans\" took on a different kind of meaning in 2005–06 and experienced a revival due to its use in various post-Katrina documentary films and TV shows. It was used for strong emotional effect in Spike Lee's four-hour \"When the Levees Broke\" (2006) and an equally moving dramatic sketch by Billy Crystal on HBO's \"Comic Relief 2006\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The stadium is home to Harlequins rugby union team, who play in the Gallagher Premiership. The stadium has a capacity of 14,800 and is situated just across the road from Twickenham Stadium.\n\nIn 1906, Harlequins were invited by the Rugby Football Union to use the new national stadium in Twickenham. In those early days, only one or two internationals were played there during the season, and it wasn't long before the RFU ground became the headquarters of the Harlequin Football Club.\n\nIn 1963, the Quins acquired an athletics ground with 14 acres (57,000 m²) just across the road from the RFU ground, which became the Harlequin training pitch. The ground was named the Stoop Memorial Ground after Adrian Stoop, a former England international and longtime Harlequins player and president but is generally known as \"The Stoop\" with even the Harlequins' official website frequently using the informal name.\n\nThe main stand is the IG Stand (West Stand). This stand has the changing rooms, a row of executive boxes across the top of the stand, a Members' Bar, the club's offices, toilets and a club shop. At the top of the stand under the roof there is also a scoreboard and a gantry where the television cameras populate. The stand was built for the start of the 2005–06 season and has a capacity of approximately 4,000.\n\nThe North Stand is a temporary structure with an estimated life of 10 years. It houses approximately 2,000 and is the only stand with supporting pillars. There is a time clock to the top left of the stand. If further expansion is going to happen then the speculation is that the North Stand would be the one to be redeveloped. There is a concern about Langhorn Drive which runs directly behind it and if it needs to be moved before expansion could take place.\n\nThe corner of the North and IG Stand has a memorial for Nick Duncombe who was a promising scrum half for Harlequins and won two caps for England. He also played for the England Sevens team in the 2002 Commonwealth Games. He died of meningitis in 2003.\n\nThe DHL Stand (East Stand) has a capacity of approximately 4,000 and has a row of corporate boxes across the top. A score board also hangs under the roof. The stand has toilets, the main public bar, Debenture Lounge and Players' Lounge which also house the Mighty Quins Village which is an area for children which consists of bouncy castle and face painting. The main public bar also has a stage where a live band performs after the match.\n\nThe South Stand has most recently been developed and was opened in the 2010–11 season. It has new toilets, a real ale bar, the Quins Head, which sells Green King IPA and guest ales and a club shop. The back of the stand also has a clock for the match.\n\nThe ground's official name changed in July 2005 from the Stoop Memorial Ground to Twickenham Stoop Stadium.\n\nThe club owns the ground freehold through its subsidiary Harlequin Estates (Twickenham) Ltd. According to the 2012 annual report submitted by the club's operating company to Companies House, in 2010 external valuers placed the combined value of the land and buildings at £27.19 million on a depreciated replacement cost basis.\n\nIn an interview with the fans website on 23 April 2012, the Chief Executive, David Ellis confirmed that an architect has visited the club and given ideas on possible improvement and further expansion of The Stoop which will be further considered if Harlequins can sell out nine or ten games a season in comparison with the six games sold out in the 2011–12 season. David Ellis also said there are some immediate concerns for development such as increasing the size of the debenture lounge and the members bar. He also mentioned the queues for drinks at the bars are too long so that will be looked into as well.\n\nOn 5 September 2012 Harlequins announced that they had begun a programme of significant investment in upgrading Twickenham Stoop Stadium. All four of the stands have been deep cleaned, this has included the installation of anti-roosting netting that features an unobtrusive fine mesh, secured high in the stands that will prevent damage to the seats and decking caused by the local pigeon population. Replacement of the broken or sun-bleached seating has also commenced and eventually all seating will be replaced block by block in a rolling programme over the coming seasons. The public areas of the stands, including the toilets, are also in the process of being decorated and upgraded. Four new turnstiles have been constructed at Gate 3 by the corner of the South and Etihad Stand to improve access and a new PA system to improve sound quality throughout the stadium. The hospitality facilities in the Etihad and LV= Stands have also undergone renovations and redecorations. Among the major improvements about to begin is the resurfacing of the North car park. Work on this project which includes improvements to access to the river, will start on 5 September and be completed within a month.\n\nIn 1995–96 and again from 1997 to 1999, the rugby league club, London Broncos, joined Harlequins at The Stoop, and they returned again in 2006–2013, becoming . In 2006 the stadium held a Harlequins rugby union match and a Harlequins rugby league game on the same day. The rugby union match was played first, and in just a few hours the stadium was switched over for the Super League match. This involved changing field markings, advertising boardings and such.\n\nSince 2006, The Stoop has also been home to the annual Rugby League Varsity Match between Oxford University and Cambridge University.\n\nOn 24 October 2009 the ground hosted the second match of the 2009 Rugby League Four Nations between world champions New Zealand and defending tournament champions (in Tri-Nations mode), Australia which resulted in a 20-all draw, 12,360 people attended the game making it the largest rugby league crowd at the venue beating the 1997 World Club Championship match between the and Canberra Raiders where 7,819 people attended.\n\nThe ground played host to the final of the 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup.\n\nIn 2015, it began hosting what was intended to be an annual event in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series. All matches were held at The Stoop except for the third-place match and Cup final, which were played at Twickenham Stadium. However, the Women's Sevens Series did not return to London for 2015–16.\n\nThe Stoop has become a regular venue for England Women's games, hosting Six Nations games and Autumn International Series games.\n\nOn 17 January 2016 The Stoop hosted the Women's Premiership final, for the first time.\n\n\n"}

After three hits, the player counts as \"dead\" and has to respawn after a delay.\nThe game is based on a heavily modified Quake engine, and despite being a budget-title, features some elements that were unique at the time of release. For example, the game models \"Lasertag Grenades\" which emit a vast number of shots in all directions, tagging every player in the vicinity.\nThe \"Mega Target\" game mode is rather novel in that it requires players to hit three targets strewn across the playing arena, before they are allowed to enter a \"core\" in which they shoot a final target to score a point. As an added element, automated defense turrets shoot at enemy players, and some can be converted to fight for your team by shooting at a sensor above the turret. This disables the turret for a few seconds and, if it's a convertible turret, makes it fight for your side until an enemy deactivates/converts it again.\n\nThe game does not feature different weapons, instead the player can collect powerups that increase the firing rate or the hit damage (thus reducing an enemy's energy canisters by two instead of one) for a limited time.\n\nThe graphics engine offers Glide, OpenGL, and software rendering.

The term refers to how many frames, on average, a group of pinsetters is able to operate without a stop, which is a malfunction or other condition which requires human assistance to fix the machine.\n\nThe goal for a center is to maximize this value. A higher frames per stop leads to less work required for the pin chasers and mechanics as well as more satisfied customers who are not waiting for repairs.\n\nA typical goal value for frames per stop is 1500 (150 lines) while well maintained pinsetters can run 2000 or more frames per stop. The busiest bowling centers can easily fit 100 lines (1000 frames) per day per lane.\n\nPreventative maintenance can easily increase this value. There are many centers out there doing between 4 and even 5000 FPS because of many innovations, modifications that mechanics have come up with throughout the years, that have been came up with to retro fit onto older Pinsetters of either brand. Many of these innovations have turned into aftermarket parts that many good mechanics prefer to buy for these reasons. These altercations have boosted performance and overall labor spent on these machines to keep them running efficiently. Pin off spots (pins sliding off spot to a certain range when the ball hits them) and setup calls caused by late pin falls or a pin that stood back up at the right time can cause these kinds of stops. These particular stops are not Pinsetter malfunction stops, those are usually accounted for in overall frames per stop. Newer AMF machines have used the overall basic mechanics since they were originally introduced in the late 1940s. The newer brunswick design of modern Pinsetters has been changed in the mid 1980s. Newer high tech scoring systems and properly setup lane machines also play a big factor in overall Pinsetter frames per stop. \n\nIt is trickier to determine frames per stop on string pinsetters (used in five pin and rubberband duckpin) as some mechanics will consider a string entanglement as a stop. String entanglement is very unpredictable and is often a function of the bowling skill level of those currently bowling. This is one big down fall to string machines verses free fall. Entanglement usually happens more frequently during league than during public bowling.\n\n"}

When he was six, two Austrian music experts visited him at home and after various tests, found that he had perfect pitch. In 1953, he made his public concert debut at the London Coliseum. By the age of eight, he could play the Wurlitzer organ and four years later he was appearing on television at the London Palladium. Although widely thought to be a self-taught pianist, he did also receive piano lessons from a lady called Mrs Sax who also lived in Mitcham.\n\nIn 1950 and 1951 he featured on the Carroll Levis show on radio.

In his sleeve notes, Hatch refers to seeing Budd on the David Frost show on television in February 1967 playing the Frank Loesser composition \"I've Never Been in Love Before\", which is on the album.\n\nAround that same time, he also recorded an album named simply \"Roy Budd\" featuring Ian Carr on trumpet, Dick Morrissey on tenor sax, Trevor Tomkins on drums, playing arrangements by fellow pianist Harry South.\n\nIn 1967 Budd provided the theme tune for the Granada TV police drama \"Mr Rose\". In 1970, Budd made his film score début for director Ralph Nelson, who was looking for an English composer for his western \"Soldier Blue\". Budd recorded a tape of his own interpretation of music by composers Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams, Max Steiner, Dimitri Tiomkin and Lalo Schifrin. Apart from the main theme, which he based on Buffy Sainte-Marie's hit song of the same title, he composed all the music required for the film and conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which Nelson commissioned at the start of the film's production.\n\nIn 1971, still in his early twenties, he composed one of his best known scores, the music for the film \"Get Carter\". The film's budget reputedly allowed only £450 for the score, but he overcame this restriction by using only three musicians, including himself playing electric piano and harpsichord simultaneously. In 1981 The Human League covered the film's theme on their album \"Dare\".\n\nAlso in 1971, Budd was asked by Nelson to compose the music to \"Flight of the Doves\", and worked with Dana who sang the film's theme; and composed the scores for the adventure \"Kidnapped\" and the western \"Catlow\". In 1972 he recorded the score to \"Fear Is the Key\", which was based on the Alistair MacLean novel. Whilst recording the score, Budd was influenced by Ronnie Scott, Tubby Hayes and Kenny Baker, thus giving the music a jazz-sounding theme. Scott played the saxophone for the car chase sequence.\n\nBudd later worked for the producer Euan Lloyd on films, including \"Paper Tiger\" (1975), \"The Wild Geese\" (1978), \"The Sea Wolves\" (1980), \"Who Dares Wins\" (1982) and \"Wild Geese II\" (1985).\n\nBudd's film work in the eighties included the scores for \"Mama Dracula\" (1980), \"Field of Honor\" (1986), and Picha's adult cartoons \"The Missing Link\" (1980) and \"The Big Bang\" (1987). Returning to his first love, he played jazz shows at Duke's Bar in Marylebone, London, partnering with harmonica player, Larry Adler. He also arranged for and accompanied Bob Hope, Tony Bennett, and Charles Aznavour.\n\nBudd recorded two albums of film music with the London Symphony Orchestra. The first contained \"Star Wars Trilogy\", \"Superman\", \"E.T.\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Star Trek: The Full Suite\", \"Alien\", \"Dr. Who\", \"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\". This was recorded at the end of May and beginning of June 1984 at the CTS Studio in Wembley. In 1985, the London Symphony Orchestra made a recording of the music from \"The Wild Geese\", again at CTS Studio. Budd's other solo albums include \"Live at Newport\", \"Everything is Coming Up Roses\", and \"Have a Jazzy Christmas\".\n\nBudd's last work was a symphonic score for the 1925 silent film \"The Phantom of the Opera\".\n\nIn 1972, as his career was peaking, Budd married the actress and singer Caterina Valente, but they divorced seven years later. They had a son named Alexander. He remarried in the 1980s to Sylvia and they remained together until his death.\n\nRoy Budd died of a brain haemorrhage at the age of 46 on 7 August 1993.\n\n"}

He showed an interest in art in his early life, and at the age of thirteen he executed a drawing which procured his admission to the academy of Düsseldorf. Here he studied for several years, and produced, among other works, a figure of St Boniface, which attracted much attention.\n\nAt the age of twenty, Rethel moved to Frankfurt, and was selected to decorate the walls of the imperial hall in the Römer with Fresco paintings of figures of famous men. At the same period he produced a series of designs illustrative of Old Testament history. Four years later, Rethel was the successful competitor for the work of ornamenting the restored council house of his native city with frescoes depicting prominent events in the career of Charlemagne, but the execution of this work was delayed for some six years. Meanwhile, Rethel occupied himself with the production of easel pictures and of drawings. In 1842, he began a striking series of designs dealing with the \"Crossing of the Alps\" by Hannibal, in which the weird power which animates his later art becomes first apparent.\n\nIn 1844 Rethel visited Rome, executing, along with other subjects, an altar-piece for one of the churches of his native land. In 1846, he returned to Aachen, and commenced his Charlemagne frescoes. But mental derangement, attributed, it is believed, to an accident that he suffered in childhood, began to manifest itself. While he hovered between madness and sanity, Rethel produced some of the most striking, individual, and impressive of his works. Strange legends are told of the effect produced by some of his weird subjects. He painted \"Nemesis\" pursuing a murderer across a flat stretch of landscape. A slaughtered body lies on the ground, while in front is the assassin speeding away into the darkness, and above an angel of vengeance. The picture, so the story goes, was won in a lottery at Frankfurt by a personage of high rank, who had been guilty of an undiscovered crime, and the contemplation of his prize drove him mad.\n\nAnother design which Rethel executed was \"Death the Avenger,\" a skeleton appearing at a masked ball, scraping daintily, like a violinist, upon two human bones. The drawing haunted the memory of his artist friends and disturbed their dreams; and, in expiation, he produced his pathetic design of \"Death the Friend.\" Rethel also executed a powerful series of drawings \"The Dance of Death\" suggested by the Belgian insurrections of 1848. It is by such designs as these, executed in a technique founded upon that of Albrecht Dürer, and animated by an imagination akin to that of the elder master, that Rethel is most widely known.\n\nAlfred Rethel died on December 1, 1859, at age 43 in Düsseldorf from the effects of a brain disease. In his last years, his brother Otto Rethel (1822–1892) took care of him, as well as his young wife Maria, daughter of August Grahl, and their daughter Else (1853–1933).\n\n\n"}

Seating capacity was up to 15,000, depending on the type of event held. It was the home of the London Knights ice hockey team, the London Towers basketball team and later the Greater London Leopards basketball team.\n\nFirst opened in 1989, the arena was built on the grounds of a former harbour warehouse at Millwall Inner Dock as part of the redevelopment of the Docklands area, which was developed from a harbour and industrial area to a trade and residential one.\n\nThe arena could seat up to 12,500 people in the stands and up to 15,000 in concert mode. Events ranged from sport events like basketball, ice hockey, wrestling and boxing to music concerts and trade exhibitions.\n\nSpectacor Management Group (SMG), the world's largest private facility management company, took over ownership of the London Arena in 1994. The company manages arenas and stadiums in the US and Europe, including the Louisiana Superdome, the Mile High Stadium in Denver and the Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo. During 1998, SMG entered into a partnership agreement with another American based company, Anschutz Sports Holdings, to hold an equal share in the ownership of London Arena.\n\nThe arena got a £10 million refit in 1998, allowing the capacity of the arena to be altered hydraulically. One of the primary reasons for the refit by joint owners, Anschutz Entertainment Group, was to introduce professional ice hockey back to London with the London Knights. Along with this, the brief given to architects, HOK Sport, was to turn the arena into a major multi-entertainment centre. This involved introducing a permanent Olympic-size ice rink, 48 luxury hospitality boxes with views over the arena, two brand new team dressing rooms, a completely refurbished foyer and box office, plus a state-of-the-art SACO SmartVision video scoreboard, the only one of its kind outside the US.\n\nHowever, the arena continued to struggle to attract enough visitors and events to be profitable and it never managed to become a financial success. One reason for this was its rather isolated geographical position, combined with poor local road and public transport access and limited parking space, although it was well served by the Crossharbour and London Arena DLR station. However, on days when events were held at the arena, it was not uncommon for the small station to be severely overcrowded.\n\nIn 2003, the arena was sold, which, combined with the disbanding of the Ice Hockey Superleague, led to the folding of the London Knights, the only tenant at the arena at the time, leaving the arena without a permanent tenant, which made the situation worse.\n\nIn 2005, the arena was closed and was superseded as the main arena by The O2 Arena, which is in The O2 entertainment complex (formerly the Millennium Dome).\n\nThe arena was demolished in June 2006 and has since been replaced by a mostly-residential development, including the Baltimore Tower. In 2007, the Crossharbour and London Arena DLR station was renamed to simply Crossharbour. However, the London Arena name still remains on a few street signs in the area.\n\nOn 18 November 1989, the Arenaball Transatlantic Challenge, the first ever Arena Football League exhibition game in Europe, was played there, with the Detroit Drive winning over the Chicago Bruisers 43–14. \n\nIn 1989, the WWE held its first ever United Kingdom event at the London Arena, as well as the UK Rampage 1991 event and Capital Carnage in December 1998.\n\nIn 1990, the arena hosted the News of the World Darts Championship. Champion that day (6 June) was Paul Cook.\n\nIn 1991, the Docklands Arena hosted the Great British Beer Festival.\n\nThe 1995 McDonald's Championship was held at the arena, with the Houston Rockets defeating Buckler Bologna 126–112 in the final.\n\nThe 1998 and 1999 editions of the Brit Awards were held at the arena, and from 1989 until 2001, it was also the annual venue of the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party.\n\nThe 2001 edition of the Deconstruction Tour was held at the arena. \n\nIn December 2005, it housed the annual 'Crisis Open Christmas' event (held the previous year in the Millennium Dome) providing food, accommodation and various medical and social services to homeless people in London, organized by the London-based homelessness charity Crisis.\n\nThe arena was often seen in the BBC TV series \"Bugs\" that was largely filmed on the Isle of Dogs between 1994 and 1997.\n\nScenes from the music video for Robbie Williams' 1999 single \"She's the One\" were filmed inside the arena, with some London Arena logos visible.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2304983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304983", "title": "Society for German Colonization", "text": "Society for German Colonization\n\nThe Society for German Colonization (, GfdK) was founded on 28 March 1884 in Berlin by Carl Peters. Its goal was to accumulate capital for the acquisition of German colonial territories in overseas countries.\n\nPeters had just returned from London, where he lived with his well-off uncle Carl Engel and studied the principles of British colonialism. In the autumn of 1884 he proceeded, together with his friend Karl Ludwig Jühlke and Count Joachim von Pfeil, to the Sultanate of Zanzibar. Peters had initially planned to prospect for gold in Southern African Mashonaland (in present-day Zimbabwe) but discovered that the territory had already been overrun by the British.\n\nPeters' Zanzibar expedition was a nuisance to the German government of Chancellor Bismarck, focused on good relations with both Sultan Barghash bin Said and the British Empire, and the German consul Gerhard Rohlfs made that clear to him. Peters, Jühlke and von Pfeil, suspiciously eyed by the British envoy John Kirk, thereupon embarked to the East African Tanganyika mainland. During their journey in November and December 1884, Peters concluded several \"treaties of protection\" (\"Schutzverträge\") with tribal chiefs in the Useguha, Ussagara, Nguru, and Ukami regions as a \"Representative of German Colonization\". The provisions, issued in German, conferred all rights to exploit the territories on the \"Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation\" in exchange for some inexpensive gifts.\n\nReturning to Germany in February 1885, Peters demanded the implementation of an official protection status for the areas. Bismarck meanwhile had developed his own colonial strategies and from 15 November 1884 hosted the Berlin Conference that fuelled the \"Scramble for Africa\". Though the chancellor still expressed serious doubts regarding Peters' land acquisitions, he finally gave in with respect to the expansion of the Belgian colonial empire in Congo while the British were stuck in the Mahdist Sudan revolt. One day after the end of the Berlin Conference, on 27 February 1885, the GfdK obtained an imperial charter issued by Emperor Wilhelm I.\n\nOn 2 April 1885 Peters formed the German East Africa Company (\"Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft\", DOAG), modelled on the East India Company. He was aware that the imperial charter marked the beginning of a large-scale seizure of land to create reality, which soon resulted in an official note of protest by Sultan Barghash bin Said. Bismarck found himself constrained to send a squadron of Imperial Navy gunboats under Admiral Eduard von Knorr to the port of Zanzibar, whereafter the sultan relented and on 20 December 1885 signed a \"treaty of friendship\" recognising the acquisitions of German East Africa. However, Peters' ongoing impetuous advance caused further unrest, culminating in the Abushiri Revolt of 1888/89.\n\nThe DOAG superseded the \"Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation\" which was merged in 1887 with the into the German Colonial Society (\"Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft\").\n\n\n"}

In July 1992, Chris Patten was appointed as the last British Governor of Hong Kong. By contrast with his predecessors, Sir Edward Youde and Sir David Wilson, Patten had little experience with Hong Kong or China, and spoke neither Mandarin nor Cantonese. The decade was essentially dominated by the political backdrop of the handover.\n\nFollowing China's Tiananmen Square protest in 1989, citizens feared the Chinese government would not keep its promise of autonomy after the handover in Hong Kong. As a result, various mediating measures took place in the run-up to 1997. The Hong Kong Basic Law was ratified on 4 April 1990 as a mini-constitution. The pro-Beijing bloc welcomed the Basic Law, calling it the most democratic legal system to ever exist in the PRC. The pro-democratic bloc criticised it as not democratic enough. Patten emphasised the increase in democracy in Hong Kong through a series of measures that affected the election processes of both legislators and municipal officials. In 1994, the PRC announced that it would terminate the Legislative Council (LegCo) in favour of the \"provisional legislative council\". In 1995, LegCo was passed and the Democratic Party denounced the provisional legislative council as illegal. The provisional legislative council operated from Shenzhen before the handover.\nAt midnight on 1 July 1997, the handover ceremony was held at the new wing of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre at Wan Chai North. The flag of the United Kingdom and the flag of the Crown colony were lowered. The flags of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and China were raised. This marked the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from British colonial rule to Chinese rule. Participated guests in the ceremony included H.R.H. The Prince of Wales, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair, President of the People's Republic of China Jiang Zemin, Premier of the People's Republic of China Li Peng, the last Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten appointed by the United Kingdom, and Tung Chee Hwa, the first chief executive of Hong Kong elected from a Beijing-controlled election.\n\nThe population of Hong Kong in 1995 and 1999 was 6.3 million and 6.9 million respectively. A total of 44,000 illegal immigrants from mainland China were arrested and deported in 1993, with the number decreased to 35,500 a year later. Hong Kong's fertility rate also become the lowest in the world, having declined to just 5.1 child per population of 1,000 in 1996.\n\nIn 1990, the outflow of people reached 62,000 people, or about one per cent of the population. The emigration rate would peak in 1992 with 66,000 people, followed by 53,000 in 1993, and 62,000 in 1994. An estimated US$$4.2 billion flowed from Hong Kong to Canada directly as a result. Much renowned tycoons in Hong Kong, such as the Shaw family, left Hong Kong for fear of adverse effects to the economy after the handover. Many Hong Kong citizens emigrated to Great Britain through the British Nationality Selection Scheme. A comparable number of families also moved to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\nFrom the late 1980s to 1990s, Hong Kong's currency stabilised. The value of the Philippine peso was dropping steadily from 17 pesos in 1984 to 30 pesos in 1993 = US$1. This caused a surge of Philippines workers going to Hong Kong in search of higher salaries under the \"maid to order\" services. The number of foreign workers grew from 9,000 in 1987 to 28,000 in 1992 and 32,000 in 1993. Women from the Philippines make up the majority with substantial numbers from Indonesia and Thailand. The term \"fei yung\" () became associated with the helpers.\n\nFamilies in need of the helpers generally have both parents working at full-time positions. In 1993, households were required to have a combined income of HKD $15,000. The foreign workers essentially run all home affairs from cooking, ironing, cleaning and caring for the young and old in the household. Most households had 4 to 5 members including at least 1 child under the age of 12, some have elderly over 65. The hiring of workers fuelled a number of social debates. From the worker's perspective, problems range from unfair treatments, discrimination to low wages were raised. From the family perspective, problems range from privacy invasion to abuse type cases. Newspapers, radios and TV broadcasts have covered the subjects on numerous accounts. To stir controversies, the media often claimed traditional amah Chinese servants as superior workers.\n\nThe entertainment industry was essentially dominated by the Four Heavenly Kings, namely: Aaron Kwok, Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau and Leon Lai. In the early stages in their careers, Jacky Cheung and Leon Lai sang songs with Japanese melodies, but in the early to mid-1990s there was a public outcry for originality in local music. In 1993, the radio broadcasting company Commercial Radio, announced that it would play only locally-written music. The purpose was to encourage local musicians to write their own lyrics. Mark Lui was a popular composer by the late 1990s.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the entertainment industry became increasingly linked to Taiwan and mainland China. Numerous television drama series, especially with themes related to ancient Chinese, were imported from Taiwan and mainland China since the early 1990s, such as Justice Bao imported from Taiwan by TVB and Romance of the Three Kingdoms imported from mainland China by ATV's Home Channel, with both dramas become very successful and created lots of discussion in the territory while broadcasting. Further successful example includes the television drama \"My Fair Princess\", a Taiwan-Mainland co-production. The show was broadcast in Hong Kong in 1999 by ATV's Home Channel and became popular among overseas Chinese worldwide. Another example of a popular mainland pop star was Faye Wong. She was born in Beijing and began singing in Cantonese, but later sang in both Mandarin and Cantonese as her career grew.\n\nThe Hong Kong film industry underwent several changes in the 1990s, especially with the emergence of the mo lei tau culture, which became synonymous with comedian Stephen Chow. Some critics claimed those films were made to alleviate social tension.\n\nIn 1999, Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ruled that children born on the mainland would be entitled the right of abode in Hong Kong so long as either parent was a Hong Kong permanent resident. This decision led to the government's reinterpretation of the Basic Law which overturned the ruling and determined that a parent would have to be a Hong Kong permanent resident at the time of the child's birth to transmit residency.\n\nThree months after the handover in July 1997, Hong Kong was dragged into the Asian Financial Crisis. At one point, the stock market fell by 22.8% within a week. Between the summer of 1997 and 1998, the leading shares in the Hang Seng Index lost nearly of its value. The government had to intervene by buying billions of dollars worth of shares. While this may have prevented the market from collapsing and staved off pressure for the Hong Kong dollar to be unpegged from the US dollar, the move was widely criticised as it undermined Hong Kong's status of a free market economy.\n\nIn 1998, the real estate bubble burst due to the government's housing policy, though the Asian financial crisis also had some influence. Upon the inauguration of Hong Kong SAR's first chief executive, Tung Chee Hwa announced the building of 85,000 flats a year, while reducing public housing wait time from 7 years to 3 years. These factors combined to begin the most severe recession in Hong Kong since 1967, which was a year of ambitious government projects that used up fiscal reserves on infrastructure and structural deficit.\n\nIn 1998, the Kai Tak Airport was closed. The new US$20 Billion Hong Kong International Airport opened for commercial use. The initial years of operation were challenging as it utilised state-of-the-art computer systems, in just about every function imaginable. The scale and size of the airport also required many innovative solutions from the Airport Authority. Over time, it became the central connecting point for many flights in the far east.\n\nThe Tsing Ma Bridge, part of the Lantau Link connecting the remote airport site to the city, was the world's second largest suspension bridge when it opened on 27 April 1997. Spanning 1,377 metres (4,518 ft), it is also the largest of all bridges in the world carrying rail traffic.\n\nThe Tung Chung and Airport Express MTR lines opened in 1998.\n\nOther major transport projects completed in the 1990s include the Tate's Cairn Tunnel (1991), San Tin Highway (1993), Yuen Long Highway (1993), North Lantau Highway (1997), Kap Shui Mun Bridge (1997), Western Harbour Crossing (1997), and Tai Lam Tunnel (1998). Many of these related to the airport project, or to completing the New Territories orbital highway.\n\n"}

This is the first state of the Abulkhairids, a branch of the Shaybanids.\n\nThe dynasty of Abu'l-Khayr Khan and his descendants is named after him, and the states ruled by them are known as Abulkhairids, such as in the Khanate of Bukhara. They may also be referred to as Shaybanids, although this is more of an umbrella term as a rival dynasty called the Arabshahids of Khwarezm were also Shaybanids, but not Abulkhairids.\n\nStarting with Shiban, brother of Batu Khan who was the ruler of the Golden Horde, the Shaybanids and their descendants held land and sway over many tribes granted to Shiban by Batu. These lands included the Golden Horde domains east of the Urals, and lands north of the Syr Darya river.\nCentral control in the Golden Horde eroded away quickly in the east and breakaway states like the Nogai Horde and the Khanate of Sibir appeared in the region.\nBy the time of Abu'l-Khayr's birth in 1412, the ulus of Shiban was fractured. At this time the eastern part of the Golden Horde (The Blue Horde) had become outside of complete control of the Golden Horde khans and pretenders, especially after the assassination of Barak Khan in 1427. Abu'l-Khayr was taken prisoner after a battle in 1427 and was released in 1428. After the passing of the then Khan of the Uzbeks and pretender to the throne of the Golden Horde, Barak Khan, Ulug Beg, the leader of the Timurid Empire, secretly orchestrated the title of khan to pass to Abu'l-Khayr. He began his rule by consolidating tribes in Siberia around his capital at Chimgi-Tura (Modern-day Tyumen). He was able to depose the reigning Khan of Sibir, Kazhy Mohammed, and took the entirety of the area under Shaybanid control.\n\nIn 1430 or 1431, Abu'l-Khayr and his army marched south into Timurid-held Khwarezm and occupied Urganj. Between 1430 and 1446 the Uzbek Khanate took land in Transoxiana from the Timurids.\n\nAbu'l-Khayr invaded the Golden Horde sometime after this and defeated Mustafa Khan near Astrakhan. The Uzbeks lost around 4,500 men during this campaign.\n\nPrior to the death of Shah Rukh in 1448 Sighnaq and other cities in Turan such as Uzkend and Sozak were invaded and captured by the Uzbeks. Sighnaq became one of the principal cities of Central Asia during this time.\n\nIn 1451 Abu'l-Khayr allied with the Timurid Abu Sa'id against his rival 'Abdullah and the two both marched on Samarkand. The Uzbek-Abu Sa'id alliance was successful and in return Abu Sa'id paid tribute to the Uzbeks.\n\nStarting in the 1460s, the Kazakh khans warred for control of modern-day Kazakhstan, led by Janibeg and Kerei Khan, the sons of the claimant to the throne of the Golden Horde, Barak Khan, founded the Kazakh Khanate. This war was made especially difficult for the Uzbeks because of a recent war with the Dorben Oirat Mongols on the Uzbeks' eastern borders. Janibeg and Kerei sought to capitalize on Uzbek weakness following the conflict.\n\nSomewhere around 1468-1470, Abu'l-Khayr Khan died in battle against the Kazakhs along with several of his sons. Sheikh Haidar, also known as Baruj Oghlan (Some sources have them as the same person or different persons), the eldest of Abu'l-Khayr's sons, succeeded him. Sheikh Haidar's reign was short and was ended after conflicts with a rival khan, Ibak.\n\nMuhammad Shaybani, Abu'l-Khayr's grandson, succeeded his father, Sheikh Haidar. Shaybani had been, along with his brother, Mahmud Sultan, given refuge by the Khan of Astrakhan, Qasim.\n\nAfter Shaybani was helped by the Moghul Khans to reclaim land in Transoxiana, he became a Moghul vassal from 1488 until around 1500. After this point, Shaybani led his own conquests which largely consisted of cities in the fractured Timurid successor states (Such as Samarkand and Bukhara). Shaybani's main rivals were the Timurid Babur and the Persian Shah Ismail.\n\nIn 1500, Shaybani officially conceded all the Kazakh held lands in Dasht-i Qipchaq to the Kazakh Khanate. Shortly after this in 1506, Shaybani captured Bukhara and the Uzbek Khanate became the Khanate of Bukhara.\n\nMuhammad Shaybani was killed in the battle of Marv by the Safavids and Shah Ismail in 1510 and had his skull turned into a jeweled drinking goblet.\n\nThese are the khans ruling over the domains of the Uzbeks prior to the Abulkhairids.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2305016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305016", "title": "List of birds of Costa Rica", "text": "List of birds of Costa Rica\n\nAlthough Costa Rica is a small country, it is in the bird-rich neotropical region and has a huge number of species for its area. The official bird list published by the Costa Rican Rare Birds and Records Committee of the Asociación Ornitológica de Costa Rica (AOCR) contains 919 species as of November 2018. This number is more than have been recorded in all of the 49 mainland United States and Canada combined. Of those species, seven are endemic (three of which are found only on Cocos Island), 66 are rare or accidental, and four have been introduced by humans. Another 73 are near-endemic with ranges that include only Costa Rica and Panama. Twenty-seven species, including five of the seven endemics, are globally vulnerable or endangered. Over an area of 51,100 km, an area smaller than West Virginia, this is the greatest density of bird species of any continental American country. About 600 species are resident, with most of the other regular visitors being winter migrants from North America.\n\nCosta Rica's geological formation played a large role in the diversification of avian species. North America and South America were initially separate continents, but millions of years of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions eventually fused the two continents together. When this happened, species from the north and south poured into the land bridge that became Central America. Birds like the hummingbird came from the south, while birds like the jay came from the north.\n\nPart of the diversity stems from the wide array of habitats, which include mangrove swamps along the Pacific coast, the wet Caribbean coastal plain in the northeast, dry northern Pacific lowlands, and multiple mountain chains that form the spine of the country and rise as high as 3,500 m. These mountain chains, the largest of which is the Cordillera de Talamanca, form a geographical barrier that has enabled closely related but different species to develop on either side of the chain. A good example of this speciation is the white-collared manakin of the Caribbean side, which is now distinct from the orange-collared manakin of the Pacific slope.\n\nIn the past, higher sea levels left the mountains as highlands, and isolation again led to distinct species developing, with over thirty now endemic to the mountains, especially the Talamanca range which extends from southern Costa Rica into Panama.\n\nThis list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the \"Check-list of North and Middle American Birds\", 7th edition through the 60th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the \"Check-list\".\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all species on the list are considered to occur regularly in Costa Rica as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants.

{"id": "2305017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305017", "title": "Kering", "text": "Kering\n\nKering S.A. () is a French multinational corporation and conglomerate headquartered in Paris, France specializing in luxury goods such as jewelry, watches, designer bags, shoes and clothing. The luxury brands owned by the group include Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, Bottega Veneta, Boucheron, Brioni, Pomellato and Ulysse Nardin.\n\nThe company was founded in 1963 by François Pinault. Pinault S.A. was quoted on Euronext Paris in 1988 and has been a constituent of the CAC 40 index since 1995. It changed its name to Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) in 1994 before adopting its current name in 2014. François-Henri Pinault has been Chairman and CEO of the group since 2005.\n\nIn 1963, with a loan from his family and a bank, François Pinault opened the \"Établissements Pinault\" in Brittany (France) and specialized in timber trading. The company grew organically and through successful acquisitions. In 1988, Pinault S.A. was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange, multiplying the group's financial power.\n\nIn 1989, it purchased 20% of CFAO, a French distribution conglomerate active throughout Africa. In 1990, Pinault S.A. and CFAO merged, and François Pinault became head of the newly formed group. This accelerated its acquisitions in the retail sector: Conforama (French furniture retailer) in 1991, Printemps (department stores in Paris) in 1992, which also owned 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer), and Fnac (French bookstore, multimedia and electronics retailer) since 1994, the year the group was renamed Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR).\n\nIn 1999, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute purchased a controlling 42% stake of the Gucci group for $3 billion and also acquired the brand Yves Saint Laurent. The group's following acquisitions confirmed its shift towards luxury: the French high-jewelry house Boucheron in 2000, the Italian leather goods maker Bottega Veneta and the fashion house Balenciaga in 2001. That same year, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute signed strategic partnerships with the fashion designers Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney. In 2004, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute reached a 99.4% ownership of the Gucci group. On the other end, the group offloaded its assets in the retail sector and Pinault Bois et Matériaux, the core of the group's wood business, was sold in 2003.\n\nIn 2003, François Pinault handed over the helm of Artémis, the family holding company that controlled Pinault-Printemps-Redoute and other assets (Château Latour, Christie's, etc.), to his son François-Henri, who became CEO of Pinault-Printemps-Redoute in 2005, the year the group officially changed its name to the acronym PPR.\n\nThe divestment of the group's retail assets continued: Le Printemps in 2006, Conforama in 2011, CFAO and Fnac in 2012, and La Redoute in 2013. The group acquired the Sowind Group (owner of Swiss high-end watchmaker Girard-Perregaux) and the Italian bespoke tailor Brioni in 2011, the Italian group Pomellato (Pomellato and Dodo jewelry brands), the Chinese jeweler Qeelin in 2012, the fashion designer Christopher Kane and luxury watch manufacturer Ulysse Nardin in 2014.\n\nPPR also developed a Sport & Lifestyle portfolio with the acquisition of Puma in 2007, Cobra Golf in 2010, and Volcom in 2011.. Cobra and Volcom are since then been divested (see the respective pages for details) and Kering only holds a minority share in Puma.\n\nOn 22 March 2013, PPR changed its name to Kering to fully achieve the group's shift towards luxury. Pronounced , to sound like the English word \"\"caring\"\", the new name is a reference to the Pinault family's region of origin, Brittany, where \"kêr\" means \"home\". The new logo has an owl as its emblem, a bird that can rotate its head 270 degrees, giving it extraordinary vision, and François Pinault's favorite animal.\n\nIn December 2014, Alessandro Michele, an unknown accessories designer, was named creative director of Gucci, and quickly revitalized the brand's creativity, fashion relevance, and profitability. From 2014 to 2017, Gucci's sales doubled from 3,497.2 million euros to 6,211.2 million euros.\n\nIn 2015, following Hedi Slimane’s four-year success at the creative helm of Yves Saint Laurent, Kering named a new creative director, Anthony Vaccarello, to pursue the evolution of the brand while maintaining its growth pace. In October 2015, Kering named Georgian-born designer Demna Gvasalia as creative director of Balenciaga. In 2013, the group took its eyewear activities in-house and launched Kering Eyewear. In March 2017, Richemont acquired 30% of Kering Eyewear and allowed Kering to acquire Cartier's eyewear plant in Sucy-en-Brie (France).\n\nIn March 2018, Kering announced it has agreed to sell its shares of Stella McCartney to its eponymous owner. In April 2018, Kering announced its intention to sell the sportswear company Volcom. In May 2018, Kering also offloaded its shares of Puma, retaining a minor 15.7%, thus becoming a pure player in luxury. In November 2018, the group announced the end of its collaboration with Yoox to open its proprietary ecommerce platform by 2020, and launched a partnership with Apple to create new instore mobile applications for the luxury sector. The group also announced its intention to branch into high-end jewelry by mid-2019. In April 2019, Kering sold Volcom to the Authentic Brands Group and opened the \"Torre Kering\", the group's new Italian offices in a 11,000 m² building in Milan.\n\nIn April 2012, Kering committed to a 4-year plan to significantly reduce its impact on the environment. The group defined a set of quantifiable targets covering both environmental and social issues, and developed the Environmental Profit & Loss account (E P&L) to measure its progress. After publishing its 2016 sustainability report, Kering announced its new sustainability program, targeting a 40% reduction of its global environmental impact by 2025, a strategy aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In January 2017, Kering was approved by the Science Based Target (formed by the Carbon Disclosure Project, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute, the WWF) the first luxury company (and first French company) to create science-based goals around reducing carbon footprint.\n\nIn February 2018, in partnership with the London College of Fashion, Kering launched the first online class (Mooc) in fashion and sustainability. In October 2018, Kering started to implement the use of the first 100% traceable organic cotton. In December 2018, with Plug and Play, Kering launched the Kering Sustainable Innovation Award to reward and invest in startups focused on sustainability and luxury. Along with a dozen of fashion brands, Kering signed a United Nations (UN) charter in December 2018 pledging to become carbon-neutral by 2050, and launched, with The Savory Institute, the first \"regenerative sourcing\" standard for fashion suppliers to measure the regenerative potential of raw materials and finished products. In May 2019, as the group was releasing guidelines for dealing with animal welfare in the fashion industry and banning models under 18 to represent adults in its shows, the French President Emmanuel Macron appointed François-Henri Pinault to set new climate standards for the fashion and retail industry. The \"\"G7 Fashion Pact\"\" was signed 3 months later by 32 global fashion corporations, right before being discussed at the 45th G7 summit.\n\nKering is an international luxury goods group based in Paris, France. Its portfolio includes brands specialized in the design, the making and the sale of fine products, especially in the leather-goods, shoes, ready-to-wear, watches and jewelry sectors:\n\nThe Kering Foundation is committed to defending women’s dignity and rights by combating violence against women and promoting women’s empowerment. Since 2009, the Foundation initiated 47 partnerships with NGOs and supported many social projects oriented towards women’s rights.\n\nMany brands have their own philanthropic projects with the support of the Kering Foundation. Gucci launched its project \"Chime for Change\", an international campaign to raise funds for women’s emancipation, focusing on education, health and justice.\n\nEvery year since 2012, the Kering Foundation has contributed to the \"International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women\" with the \"White Ribbon for Women\" campaign. The 2018 campaign focused on gender-based cyberbullying. In 2019 ,for its 10-year anniversary, the annual budget of the Foundation was doubled to $2 million.\n\nIn 2015, Kering became an official partner of the Cannes Film Festival and launched \"Women in Motion\" to highlight the contribution of women to the film industry, in front and behind the camera. The program is based on talks where personalities share their recommendations for the advancement of women’s representation in the industry. The \"Women in Motion\" Awards are awarded annually to a person who embodies the role of women in the film industry, and another to a promising name in cinema. The previous winners were:\n\nIn March 2019, the Women in Motion Awards was expanded to the Rencontres d'Arles photography festival. In May 2019, the Cannes Partnership was renewed for five additional years.\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2013, Kering became part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices world and Europe.\n\nIn September 2018, Kering joined the STOXX Europe 50 index. In November 2018, the group announced the share repurchase of 1% of its share capital.\n\n\n"}

A versatile player who is a strong reader of the game, allowing him to make crucial interceptions despite not being blessed with great pace, Bennett is also known for his trademark long-range free kicks.\n\nBennett took up Singaporean citizenship in September 2002 under the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme to play international football for Singapore. With 142 caps for Singapore, he currently holds the national record for the most international matches played.\n\nBennett was selected to join the FAS Milo Scheme for talented young footballers at the age of 12. He was drafted as a trainee by National Football League side Tiong Bahru three years later, giving him the opportunity to train with the team before he left Singapore to further his tertiary studies in England. He returned to Singapore in 1999 hoping to make a career as a professional footballer. Balestier Central coach P N Sivaji gave him his first opportunity with the S.League club. Bennett moved to previous club Tanjong Pagar United (formerly Tiong Bahru) in May 2000. Having played as a midfielder for 15 years, his defining career shift to defence came when coach Tohari Paijan played him as a centre-back in the absence of regular stopper Lim Tong Hai in a league match. Recognition of his performances came when he was selected in the Singapore selection that faced Manchester United and Liverpool in a couple of high-profile friendly matches, and culminated in a S.League Player of the Year award.\n\nBradford City manager Jim Jefferies was impressed with Bennett and offered him a trial at the Yorkshire club. On 8 February 2002, Wrexham manager Denis Smith signed him on a short-term contract til the end of the 2001-02 Football League. Although it is not known how much Wrexham had paid to secure the deal, the club's fans paid money to ensure the club could secure Bennett's signature. He made his league debut against Port Vale on 6 March 2002, partnering Trinidad & Tobago international Dennis Lawrence in the heart of defence. He was assessed as \"enjoying a remarkable start, looking composed at the back and reading the game superbly\" by the fans, who had contributed money to sign the player. Bennett made over 20 appearances for the Welsh side but with the Welsh side 4th from bottom in the league, relegation was confirmed at the end of the season.\n\nBennett made a brief return to the S.League in 2002, playing 11 games for Singapore Armed Forces during their title-winning season.\n\nHe returned to Wrexham in the 2002-03 season. His second spell was more successful, making 21 appearances, including 3 League Cup games as he helped the club win the FAW Premier Cup and clinch promotion to the Second Division. Bennett was offered new terms by Wrexham at the end of the season but chose to reject the contract to return to Singapore to improve his chances of featuring regularly for the national team.\n\nAmid interest from Home United, Tampines Rovers and Woodlands Wellington after his Wales stint, Bennett signed for defending champions Singapore Armed Forces in mid-2003.\n\nHe moved to ambitious Woodlands Wellington in 2005, joining his international colleagues Agu Casmir, Itimi Dickson, Goh Tat Chuan and Masrezwan Masturi. Bennett led the team to 3rd place in the 2005 S.League, and 2nd and 3rd placing in the 2005 and 2006 Singapore Cup respectively.\n\nAfter two seasons with the Rams, Bennett rejoined Singapore Armed Forces for a second time, achieving the S.League and Singapore Cup double in 2007 and 2008.\n\nIn the 2007 Singapore Cup final won by Singapore Armed Forces on 25 November, Bennett was involved in a clash with Tampines Rovers' Noh Alam Shah, a fellow Singapore national team player towards the end of the match. Noh Alam Shah kneed Bennett in the head in a tussle for the ball and after being dragged away by his team-mates, returned and kicked Bennett in the head. Bennett was knocked unconscious and had to be taken to hospital while Alam Shah was sent off by referee Abas Daud. The incident resulted in Alam Shah receiving a 12-month global ban which was reduced to 7 months on appeal.\n\nBennett was handed the club's captaincy in 2012. As captain he won the Singapore Cup in 2012 as well as the league title in 2014.\n\nAfter playing for the Warriors for 9 years and amassing four league titles and winning the Singapore Cup three times, Bennett signed for Geylang International ahead of the 2016 S.League campaign. He was a key cog of the Eagles defence, helping the team to the league's third-best defensive record, with 29 goals conceded in 24 games as Geylang finished fifth in the nine-team competition.\n\nIn 2017, Bennett joined the 6th S.League club of his career, signing for Tampines Rovers FC for the 2017 S.League season. He made 31 appearances in all competitions for the Stags last season and was a key member of league's best local defence, earning him a two-year extension with the club despite almost reaching 40 years old.\n\nAfter deliberating for two years, Bennett received his citizenship under the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme and became a naturalised Singapore national footballer. He made his debut under Jan B. Poulsen in a friendly match against Philippines on 11 December 2002. He had a goal disallowed that day, an effort that he still maintains was a legitimate goal. He would score his first international goal against Hong Kong on 4 August 2003. His timely citizenship meant that he took part in the 2002 ASEAN Football Championship in co-hosts Singapore. The Lions failed their target of reaching the final, exiting the competition at the group stage after poor performances by the team, including an abysmal 4-0 loss at home to traditional rivals Malaysia.\n\nUnder coach Radojko Avramović, Bennett never missed a call-up to Singapore's tournament squad. He scored with a long-range effort in the 3rd minute of the 2004 finals first leg against Indonesia in front of an intimidating 100,000 Senayan crowd. Singapore went on to win their second title after their 1998 triumph. Bennett completed a hat-trick of titles with tournament wins in 2007 and 2012.\n\nBennett earned his 100th cap against Thailand on 24 August 2011 and was inducted into the FIFA Century Club. With his 122nd appearance in the away leg of the 2012 ASEAN Football Championship finals, Bennett surpassed Aide Iskandar and Malek Awab as Singapore's most capped player.\n\nAs of January 2017, Bennett has amassed 132 caps, tied with Shahril Ishak as Singapore's most-capped player. As of November 2017, Bennett has 141 caps for Singapore.\n\nBennett was born in England. His family moved to Singapore when he was two years old.

Optodes usually have the polymer matrix coated onto the tip of an optical fibre, but in the case of evanescent wave optodes the polymer is coated on a section of fibre that has been unsheathed.\n\nOptodes can apply various optical measurement schemes such as reflection, absorption, evanescent wave, luminescence (fluorescence and phosphorescences), chemiluminescence, surface plasmon resonance. By far the most popular methodology is luminescence.\n\nLuminescence in solution obeys the linear Stern–Volmer relationship. Fluorescence of a molecule is quenched by specific analytes, e.g., ruthenium complexes are quenched by oxygen. When a fluorophore is immobilised within a polymer matrix myriad micro-environments are created. The micro-environments reflect varying diffusion co-efficients for the analyte. This leads to a non-linear relationship between the fluorescence and the quencher (analyte). This relationship is modelled in various ways, the most popular model is the two site model created by James Demas (University of Virginia).\n\nThe signal (fluorescence) to oxygen ratio is not linear, and an optode is most sensitive at low oxygen concentration, i.e., the sensitivity decreases as oxygen concentration increases. The optode sensors can however work in the whole region 0–100% oxygen saturation in water, and the calibration is done the same way as with the Clark type sensor. No oxygen is consumed and hence the sensor is stirring insensitive, but the signal will stabilize more quickly if the sensor is stirred after being put into the sample.\n\nOptical sensors are growing in popularity due to the low-cost, low power requirements and long term stability. They provide viable alternatives to electrode-based sensors or more complicated analytical instrumentation, especially in the field of environmental monitoring although in the case of oxygen optrodes, they do not have the resolution as the most recent cathodic microsensors.\n\n"}

It is situated within the unitary authority of North Somerset, between Clevedon and Weston-super-Mare on the North Somerset Levels. The parish has a population of 388.\n\nThe late medieval village cross stands on \"The Triangle\".\n\nThe parish was part of the hundred of Chewton.\n\nThe village suffered serious flooding in the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 when the sea walls were breached and the church in Kingston Seymour was said to have of water in it for ten days. The parish, which extends to the Severn Estuary coast, saw flooding on a regular basis as late as the 1800s. After flooding, the land was considered unsuitable for dairy cattle for some time and the resulting bad air was said to cause \"attacks of the ague\" in local people.\n\nKingston Seymour school opened its doors in 1858. Closing in 1968, the building was then used as an office for the local drainage board and later as a spinning and weaving centre. It has now been converted into a private house.\n\nThe village used to be on the route of the Clevedon branch line a railway line that ran from Yatton railway station to Clevedon. It was opened in 1847 and passenger services ceased in 1966. The last original bits of track, around Kingston Seymour, were lifted in the late 1980s.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.\n\nThe parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.\n\nNorth Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District.\n\nThe parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency (previously Woodspring county constituency). It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party.\n\nThe village is close to Blake's Pools a nature reserve owned by Environment Agency and leased by the Avon Wildlife Trust, on the banks of the Congresbury Yeo close to its mouth. The three freshwater and brackish pools were dug between 1983 and 1987 to attract wildlife. It forms part of the Severn Estuary Site of Special Scientific Interest, Special Protection Area and RAMSAR site.\n\nThe Anglican parish Church of All Saints dates from the late 14th or early 15th century and is in the Perpendicular Gothic style. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building.\nThe porch contains a plaque which describes the Bristol Channel floods which affected this area of coastal Somerset in 1607. During that event the floodwaters rose over the top of the church's pews and filled the font. The plaque records the date as occurring in 1606 using the old style dating system in use at the time however the flood occurred during 1607 on the current (new style) dating system. \n"}

{"id": "2305061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305061", "title": "Zagor", "text": "Zagor\n\nZagor is an Italian comic book created by editor and writer Sergio Bonelli (pseudonym Guido Nolitta) and artist Gallieno Ferri. Zagor was first published In Italy by Sergio Bonelli Editore in 1961.\n\nZagor's real name is Patrick Wilding, the son of Mike and Betty. He is a western-tarzanesque character living in a fictional forest named Darkwood, located in Pennsylvania, north eastern United States. His name \"Zagor\" comes from its Indian name \"Za-Gor Te-Nay\", whose fictional meaning is \"The Spirit with the Hatchet\". Though the writers do not mention exact dates, Zagor is supposed to be active during the first half of the 19th century, or around 1825–1830. Zagor fights to maintain peace all over his territory, protecting the Indian tribes and hunting down criminals regardless of their skin color. Son of an army official retiring to live as a pioneer and trapper in the forests of the north-east, Patrick Wilding sees his parents die at the hands of a band of Abenaki Indians, led by Salomon Kinsky. Taken in by the middle-aged trapper nicknamed \"Wandering Fitzy\", the boy grows up with only one thought on his mind: revenge. Fitzy teaches him how to make a deadly weapon out of a hatchet, and when he is old enough to fulfill his vengeance, Patrick goes on to track down and mercilessly slay his family's assailants. As he is about to enact his revenge on defeated Kinsky, Patrick is presented with the evidence of his father's dark past. Lieutenant Mike Wilding was a ruthless leader of the force which massacred the Abenaki community on the banks of Silver Lake, an event which saw him dishonorably discharged from the army. The attack on the Patrick's home on the shore of Clear Water river was, in fact, a rightful retribution for commander Wilding's wrongdoings. As Kinsky is about to gun down confused and distracted Patrick, Fitzy arrives in time to save the life of his protégé but, in doing so, is mortally wounded and dies in Patrick's arms. The boy's understanding of the relativity of the concepts of good, evil and justice comes in question as he is devastated with pain, grief, confusion and the genocide of his own that mirrors the one committed by Mike Wilding years ago. To aton for his father's sins, as well as his own, Patrick is compelled to transform himself (with his accomplices the Sullivans, a family of acrobats who are his image makers) into Za-Gor-Te-Nay, shortened to Zagor. He is a kind of avenger always ready to side with the weak and the oppressed, whether red, white or black, whoever they may be. Moving his shack to an island surrounded by quick-sand in a marshy area of Darkwood Forest, Zagor begins his work as a peacemaker. He takes Darkwood tribes under his wing earning himself a distinction of the Lord of Darkwood, beloved and respected by peaceful natives and trappers, and feared and hated by anyone who would endanger the peace between reds and whites. Zagor is not a typical western character, as his stories mix horror and science fiction by side with a bit of humour coming mostly from his sidekick Chico, a short, fat Mexican man who became his best friend. His full name is \"Don\" Chico Felipe Cayetano Lopez Martinez y Gonzales.\n\nZagor's abilities include almost superhuman strength, agility and endurance. His fighting prowess is extraordinary whether he finds himself in a gunfight or plain brawl. If needed, Zagor is more than capable of dealing with multiple opponents and is basically invincible in a one-on-one bout. In many occasions, he is also seen fighting North American wildlife (such as cougars, alligators and even bears) with nothing more than his hatchet or knife. He is infallible with his oval bladed hatchet, whether he uses it as a melee weapon or as a projectile. Zagor is also shown possessing an incredible speed that, paired with his almost cat-like reflexes, often allows him to catch a traveling spear or even an arrow, a feats which usually leave Indians in an awe further solidifying Zagor's status of an emissary of the Great Spirit (a superstition that Zagor uses to his advantage). Zagor can quickly cover great distances using his trademark branch-to-branch way of traveling where he jumps from one treetop to another. His war cry seems to be a roar of an unidentifiable (and presumably horrific) creature. This is one of Zagor's calling cards, the one which usually leaves wrongdoers in a frantic state of mind.\n\nThroughout the series, it is strongly suggested that Zagor, although not a demi-god that he claims to be, is indeed in Manitou's good graces and on more than few occasions he has served as a champion of heavens against the forces of evil drawing his strength from the divine intervention (best example being the storyline of Hellingen's Return - episodes #275 through #280). Later stories have also hinted that Zagor's great abilities could come from him being a descendant of an Atlantean royalty or perhaps a reincarnation of an ancient African deity.\n\nAlthough capable of near-superhuman feats, there were rare instances when Zagor was bested by certain extraordinary individuals. In a contest of skill (trials of power, speed, reflexes, marksmanship, breath-diving and beast-fighting) against multi-talented villain Supermike, Zagor is forced into a seventh round tie-breaker - a life-or-death duel atop of a small platform surrounded by the garden of spikes and daggers (which he, eventually, wins convincingly while even managing to spare the life of an opponent).\n\nWhen it comes to a fair slugfest, there were very few foes able to hold their own against the Spirit with the Hatchet. Such is the case with the Alchemist Robert Gray. In the episodes \"Criminal Genius\" (#252) and \"The Rebellion of the Mohawks\" (#253) Zagor and Gray duke it out twice with Zagor coming on top the first time around and Gray winning the second duel. It is worth noting, though, that Gray had an advantage of his steel prosthetic hands thus forcing brutally beaten Zagor to dishonor himself by resorting to shoot the unarmed opponent. Another example of worthy adversary comes in the face of Captain Otto Kraus, commander of the special paramilitary unit called the Black Wolves (episode #32 - \"The Fugitive\"). Kraus, proficient practitioner of the unnamed oriental martial arts, although weary from hours of being chased by Zagor and the Pennacooke Indians, still manages to K.O. Zagor in a convincing fashion, just before he is, ironically, shot dead by a surviving member of his own unit for deserting the squad on the battlefield.\n\nNotable allies:\n\nChico (Felipe Cayetano Lopez Martinez y Gonzales) - Short obese bumbling but kindhearted Mexican. He is Zagor's loyal companion and a comic relief throughout the series.\n\nTonka - Chief of Mohawk tribe and Zagor's blood brother.\n\nDigging Bill - Treasure hunter.\n\nCaptain \"Fishleg\" - Commander of a whaler.\n\nColonel Norman Perry - Military doctor and influential person in the army brass.\n\nBaron Icarus LaPlume (Feather) - An inventor obsessed with flying who always ends up victim of his own devices.\n\nDrunky Duck - Indian postman whose unorthodox ways of delivering mail infuriate Chico.\n\n\"Doc\" Lester - Trapper and former dentist. Has an elusive past.\n\nRochas - Trapper always engaged in fists challenges with Zagor.\n\nBat Batterton - Private detective who always fails the disguises.\n\nMany Eyes - Shaman which embraces white people's medicine and technology. One of the few Indians to know Zagor's true identity.\n\nFrida Lang - Austrian countess and Zagor's love interest.\n\nMemorable enemies include:\n\nProfessor Hellingen - Mad scientist and Zagor's nemesis. Not only that he is capable of creating a doomsday devices but he has also managed to cheat death and return to the land of the living to wreak havoc not once, but twice.\n\nKandrax - Celtic druid who wields mystical powers.\n\nMortimer - Scheming genius and a conspirator. Inspired by A. C. Doyle's professor Moriarty.\n\nSuperMike - Man of many talents and abilities and Zagor's evil counterpart.\n\nThe Alchemist (Robert Gray) - Terrorist with prosthetic arms and expert in chemical warfare. One of very few persons to defeat Zagor in a fistfight.\n\nOne-eyed Jack - Glass-eyed outlaw.\n\nBaron Rakosi - Vampire.\n\nEven though Zagor is popular in Italy, it is even more popular in Croatia and Serbia, where it is being published to this day; his stories are also published in other former Yugoslav republics Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Slovenia. In former Yugoslavia, Zagor was published by the Serbian publication \"Dnevnik\" in its \"Zlatna Serija\" edition from 1968. Although not as popular, Zagor comics are also published in Austria.\n\nZagor is one of the most popular comic heroes in Turkey since the 1960s. Two unofficial Zagor movies have been produced in Turkey in 1971, \"Zagor - Kara Korsan'in hazineleri\" and \"Zagor - Kara Bela\". Zagor was also published in Greece and in Israel in the 1970s, where, during that time, Tex Willer was published as well.\n\nIn 2015, Epicenter Comics released, in U.S.A., the first English-language edition of the three-part story \"Zagor! Terror from the Sea\", including extra essays, introduction texts and original covers.\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of the region of Thessaly. Its capital is the city of Larissa. Total population 284,325 (2011).\n\nLarissa is the second largest regional unit in Greece, exceeded only by Aetolia-Acarnania. It covers about one-third of Thessaly. It borders the regional units of Kozani to the northwest, Pieria to the northeast, the Aegean Sea to the east, Magnesia to the southeast, Phthiotis to the south, Karditsa to the southwest and Trikala to the west.\n\nThe tallest mountain in Greece, Mount Olympus (2,917 m) is situated in the northeastern part of the regional unit. Mount Ossa is situated in the east, at the Aegean coast. The lower stretch of the river Pineios flows through the Vale of Tempe, between Olympus and Ossa.\n\nThe northern part is covered with forests, but most of the regional unit is fertile land, the Thessalian Plain.\n\nLarissa has a mainly Mediterranean climate with hot summers and mild winters. Winter is harsher in the mountains areas, notably the north and Mount Olympus. Larissa is often the warmest area in Greece in summer and the coldest in winter. The highest temperature ever recorded was 45.4 °C (2000) and the coldest was -21.6 °C (1968). The city experiences very often temperatures over 40 °C.\n\nThe regional unit Larissa is subdivided into 7 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):\n\nLarissa was created as a prefecture () in 1882. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Larissa was created out of the former prefecture Larissa. The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.\n\n\"Note:\" Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece, they were abolished in 2006.\n\nThe area of Larissa was home to the Pelasgians until they merged into the broader Greek culture. The area was invaded and was ruled by the Kingdom of Macedonia a few centuries later, and was conquered by the Roman Republic after the Third Macedonian War. The Roman imperial period was followed by Byzantine rule, which was in turn succeeded by the Ottoman Empire. Parts of Thessaly revolted during the Greek War of Independence, but Thessaly remained under Ottoman Turkish rule. It was awarded to Greece in the Congress of Berlin in 1878, and finally incorporated into the Hellenic Kingdom in 1881, albeit parts of the modern Larissa prefecture, including Tyrnavos, Elassona and Sarantaporo, remained Ottoman. During the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, the area was successfully invaded by the Ottomans, but in the end Greece conceded only minor territorial losses. The northern portions of the prefecture, the Tempe Valley and Mount Olympus, were taken by Greece during the First Balkan War in 1912-1913.\n\nThe economy increased since the annexation in 1881 and later after 1913 for the north. After the Greco-Turkish War in Asia Minor of 1920-1922, refugees were relocated to the Prefecture. Several villages were created for them across the prefecture. During World War II, the area was a major scene of partisan activity. The occupation and the subsequent Greek Civil War however destroyed most of the local infrastructure. From the 1950s on, the road network was significantly expanded: the GR-1 was opened in 1957 and extended in the 1960s to the Tempe Valley. In 1984, the University of Thessaly opened its doors.\n\nIts main economy since the 1970s are manufacturing, businesses, communications and services. Agriculture is the second leading industry.\n\nThe Thessalian Plain is famous for its crops including fruits (watermelon and melon), vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, cucumbers, onions, etc.), cotton, dairy, cattle and other crops.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of highways E75 and the main railway from Athens to Thessaloniki crosses Thessaly. The region is directly linked to the rest of Europe through International Airport of Central Greece located in Nea Anchialos in a small distance from Larisa (26 kilometers).\n\n\nSporting clubs include:\n\n"}

A person under the age of 20 years cannot undertake upasampadā (i.e., become a monk (\"bhikkhu\") or nun (\"bhikkhuni\")), but can become a novice (m. \"samanera\", f. \"samaneri\"). After a year or at the age of 20, a novice will be considered for upasampadā.\n\nTraditionally, the upasampadā ritual is performed within a well-demarcated and consecrated area called \"sima\" (\"sima malaka\") and needs to be attended by a specified number of monks: \"ten or even five in a remoter area\".\n\nCustoms regarding \"upasampada\" vary between regional traditions. In the Theravada tradition, monastics typically undertake higher ordination as soon as they are eligible. In East Asia, it is more typical for monastics to defer or avoid \"upasampada\" ordination entirely, remaining novices (samanera) for most or all of their monastic career. This difference may originate from the historical shortage of temples in East Asia able to provide higher ordination according to the Vinaya.\n\n"}

Passive investors, on the other hand, feel that simply investing in a market index fund may produce potentially higher long-term results. The majority of mutual funds underperform market indexes.\n\nActive investors feel that the small-cap market is less efficient since smaller companies are not followed as closely as larger blue-chip firms. A less efficient market should favor active stock selection. The core-/satellite concept combines a passive style in efficient market and an active style in less efficient markets.\n\nGrowth vs. Value\nActive investors can be divided into growth and value seekers. Proponents of growth seek companies they expect (on average) to increase earnings by 15% to 25%.\n\nValue investors look for bargains — cheap stocks that are often out of favor, such as cyclical stocks that are at the low end of their business cycle. A value investor is primarily attracted by asset-oriented stocks with low prices compared to underlying book, replacement, or liquidation values. There is also a diversification effect: Returns on growth stocks and value stocks are not highly correlated. By diversifying between growth and value, investors can help manage risk and still have high long-term return potential.\n\nSmall Cap vs. Large Cap.\nSome investors use the size of a company as the basis for investing. Studies of stock returns going back to 1925 have suggested that \"smaller is better.\" On average, the highest returns have come from stocks with the lowest market capitalization (common shares outstanding times share price). But since these returns tend to run in cycles, there have been long periods when large-cap stocks have outperformed smaller stocks. Also, early on, small cap stocks had bigger premiums and were more expensive to buy and sell, but isn't easily captured in historical analysis, and in reality likely skewed total return for investors.\n\nSmall-cap stocks also have higher price volatility, which translates into higher risk. Some investors choose the middle ground and invest in mid-cap stocks with market capitalizations between $500 million and $8 billion — seeking a tradeoff between volatility and return. In so doing, they give up the potential return of small-cap stocks.\n\nMostly taken from www.axaonline.com/rs/3p/sp/5044.html#what's\n"}

Phelan, F. Eaton, D. Burslem and E. Burslem. The original name, “Celtic Adorers”, was chosen by J. Phelan. This name changed in the early 1990s. The Magnificat Meal Movement is regarded by mainstream Christian churches as a cult. Debra Burslem, its most prominent ongoing leader, now lives in Vanuatu which some claim is for the purpose of avoiding the Australian Federal Police on multiple charges of embezzlement and tax fraud.\n\nThe group describes its aims as primarily prayer, service and the study of seeking the truth as revealed through the light of the “Celtic Corma Adoration” (CCA) research.\n\nThe Magnificat Meal Movement International seeks to maintain the \"original light teachings established by Yashua Jesus.\" The CCA and the MMMI recognize the 1st-century church teachings established by the Marys and Joseph of Arimathea and the original teachings of Celtic followers of the “way” in the Celtic realm of Britain in the first century.\n\nThe CCA and the MMMI have a Levitical priesthood and the global church-basilica is made up of churches throughout the world. Adherents believe that salvation is through unity with the ‘living one’ by being united with the identity of Yashua Jesus. The CCA and the MMMI do not believe in the “End Times” or Millennial-type teachings, but advocate that we are living already in a \"New Galactic Era\".\n\nAdherents of both the CCA and the MMMI are 7th Day Keepers. No work is done on the Sabbath / Saturday / seventh day or on the 7 Biblically Appointed Sabbaths. The congregations come together each Sabbath Saturday, in a home-basilica/church location, for praise, galactic light era teaching, and “Divine Light Presence” ceremonies. \n\nThe most publicized home-basilica-church and teaching center for the CCA and its offshoot, the MMMI, is based in Helidon, a small town about 130 km west of Brisbane in the Lockyer Valley just east of Toowoomba in Queensland, Australia.\n\nBoth the CCA and the MMMI emphasise Marian-style study and application of the Gospel of Mary. Mary is honored as an example of co-operation of the creature with the Divine. All adherents are encouraged to live a similar lifestyle of divine co-operation as they feel and study such writings as the Gospel of Mary.\n\nResearch and study are highly encouraged as it is believed that \"Light\" research enables the discovery of truths hidden and the removal of deceptions. In this way, each individual is encouraged to develop their own \"revelations of light and understanding of truth.\" Adherents are strongly encouraged to think freely and to not be oppressed by past religious inculturisations. A daily life of thanksgiving (Eucharistic) in the light of ones personal \"cosmovision\" is encouraged.\n\nHumanitarian work and service to others, is also important to both the CCA and the MMMI missionary offshoot, as a work of being united like 'Slaves of Love' for humanity as outlined in the ‘Gospel of Thomas’ Nag Hammadi Library. Most MMMI and CCA and various other support groups are involved in extensive works of prayer, unity and service to humanity which they each finance from their own businesses.\n\nThose adherents who wish to live a lifestyle completely given in service to the “Divine Light Presence” apply to stay at one of the teaching centers for a period of 3 months or 12 months. They learn to live life as a “Slave of the Eucharist.” According to the group, the name ‘slave’ stems from the biblical teachings of Romans. They do not have to give anything over to the CCA or the MMMI and return to their communities to live out the teachings in their own home church and families once the period of stay is over. Both the MMMI and the CCA adherents have a high commitment to partnership and marriage. \n\nThe use of photovoltaic \"color energies\" is extensively practised by both the CCA and the MMMI, for the development of unity with the \"Light Presence.\" (Blue for example being the colour of spiritual enhancement.) Colour use of clothing, buildings, and gems are used to denote the \"light energies\" being used.\n\nThe Celtic Corma Adorers (CCA) Church, or the Magnificat Meal Movement International (MMMI) has been characterised as an offshoot of the Roman Catholic Church, having been excommunicated and barred from the Eucharist by the Catholic Bishop of Toowoomba, Bill Morris, who has made repeated statements distancing the Roman Catholic Church from the movement.\n\nThough the followers of the movement presently deny any past connection to the Roman Catholic Church, the word 'Meal' within the name of the movement referred originally to the sharing of the Eucharist. The group was initially very involved in reviving the practice of Eucharistic Adoration in Catholic parishes, and Debra Burslem, the self-proclaimed Prophetess of the movement, publicly affirmed her affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church and claims to have received support from Catholic priest Fr. Jack Salisbury.\n\nThe movement was initially predominantly made up of traditionalist and conservative Novus Ordo Roman Catholic parishioners who had rejected the post-Vatican II changes to the Catholic Church and announced in the late 1990s that the Novus Ordo Mass was invalid. After being ostracized and denounced by the Latin Rite hierarchy in Queensland, the Melkite Catholic Eparchy of St Michael, Archangel began to support the movement, the Melkite bishop discreetly providing priests to perform church functions for members. The Catholics involved in the movement who did not join an Eastern Catholic church secretly began attending traditional Latin services, either within the Society of Saint Pius X or local Catholic parishes with a blessing to perform the Tridentine Mass.\n\nCORMA stands for Co-Redemptorist, Mediatrix of All Graces and Advocate, the title by which the movement prefers to refer to Mary.\n\nMMM have placed signs on some of their properties claiming to be part of The Commonwealth of Caledonia Australis.\n\nA MMM member has attempted to use CCA citizenship to avoid charges relating to vehicular offenses, denying the authority of the Courts.\n\nOur Lady's Mount—holds stakes in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property deeded to them by MMM members.\n\nCorpus Christi International—educational publishing company and sometime sponsor/coordinator of MMM affiliate youth events.\n\n"}

Both parishes include the nearby village of Redhill. Wrington lies in the valley of the Congresbury Yeo river, about east of Weston-super-Mare and south-east of Yatton. It has a population of 2,633 according to the 2011 Census.\n\nThe village dates back to Roman times and there is strong evidence of Saxon occupation as well.\n\nWrington was historically part of the hundred of Brent-cum-Wrington.\nWrington Cottage Hospital opened in 1864 and admitted 24 patients in its first year of operation. The first surgeon was Horace Swete, who wrote the \"Habdy Book of Cottage Hospitals\". It was referred to by Florence Nightingale in 1869.\n\nWrington had its own railway station between 1901 and 1963, on the Wrington Vale Light Railway, which ran from Congresbury to Blagdon.\n\nAs a parish council, Wrington Council has responsibility for setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. Its role includes initiating maintenance and repair of parish facilities. It falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset, which was created in 1996 under the Local Government Act 1992. North Somerset covers some of the ceremonial county of Somerset, but is administered separately from today's non-metropolitan county. Its headquarters are in the town hall of Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, the parish lay in the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974, the parish was part of Axbridge Rural District.\n\nAn electoral ward exists with the same name. This includes Butcombe as well as Wrington parish. The ward population taken at the 2011 census was 2,851.\n\nThe parish is represented in the parliamentary House of Commons as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party.\n\nThe Church of All Saints has 13th-century foundations. It was remodelled with the addition of a west tower about 1450. There was a restoration in 1859 and further restoration of the tower in 1948. The church includes on either side of the door stone busts to John Locke and Hannah More dating from the early 19th century. The chancel has an 1832 Gothic reredos by Charles Barry. The rood screen is from the 16th century. It has a tall four-stage tower with set-back buttresses which develop into crocketed pinnacles at the top stage. The top displays moulded string courses and a trefoil-pierced triangular parapet with gargoyles and corner pinnacles. It is Grade I listed. According to Freeman it is \"one of the \"highest achievements of architectural genius\". It dates from the period 1420–1450. The belfry stair is in the south-east turret. The height of the tower is to the top of the pinnacles.\n\nThe 17th-century rectory is Grade II listed.\n\nThe church's bells ring automatically. Until 2012, this took place every 15 minutes even through the night, but after a noise abatement order was served, it was reduced to hourly during the night.\n\nThe village primary school was opened on 1 May 1857 and is Grade II listed.\n\nA major institution in the local economy is the Butcombe Brewery, a microbrewery set up in the nearby village of Butcombe in 1978 by Simon Whitmore, the managing director of Courage Western, made redundant in a restructuring, and his wife Maureen. In 2003 the business was sold to Guy Newell and Paul Horsley, and moved to an industrial estate at Wrington, to be housed in a purpose-built brewery completed in March 2005. In the same year the brewery set up a joint venture with Thatcher's, the Long Ashton Cider Company, to produce a keg cider. In 2008 output was 24,000 barrels a year and the number of direct outlets was about 450.\n\nIn birth order:\n\nWrington Redhill AFC plays at the recreation ground in Wrington. The club operates a 1st team, a reserve team and an A team. The 1st team plays in the Erra Somerset County League in the premier division. The reserve team plays in Weston super Mare and District League Division 1 and A team in the W&D division 4. The club badge is a gold rampant dragon (wyvern), the same as the emblem on the unofficial Flag of Somerset. The club colours are green and black.\n\nWrington currently has two senior teams. The 1st XI is currently in the North Somerset Cricket League Saturday Division 1. The 2nd XI is in Saturday Division 3. The club's limited overs team also finished as runners-up in the league's Butcombe Brewery KO Cup. The club also has a youth system, running teams in the North Somerset Youth Cricket Leagues at Under 17, 15, 13 and 11 levels. The club's facilities and pitch have been improved in the last few years, and alongside an improved pitch It now has two nets, used for training sessions for all ages and levels.\n\n"}

In 1847, Christoph Knauth adopted his middle name Franz as his new surname, and his son followed suit.\n\nHe suffered in early life from the hostility of his parents to a musical career. He was twenty years old when his father's animosity was conquered and he was allowed to live in Dessau to study organ playing under Friedrich Schneider. The two years of study under that famous teacher were advantageous chiefly in making him uncommonly intimate with the works of Bach and Händel, his knowledge of which be shown in his editions of the former's \"St Matthew Passion\", \"Magnificat\" and ten cantatas, and the latter's \"Messiah\" and \"L'Allegro\", although some of these editions have long been controversial among musicians.\n\nIn 1843 he published his first book of songs, which was followed by some fifty more books, containing in all about 250 songs. In his native Halle he filled various public offices, including those of city organist as well as conductor of the Singakademie and the Symphony. He also served as royal music-director and music master at the university. The first book of songs was warmly praised by Liszt and Schumann, and the latter wrote a lengthy review of it in the \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\" and later published it separately as well.\n\nDeafness began to make itself apparent as early as 1841. Franz also suffered from a nervous disorder that in 1868 compelled him to resign his offices. His future was then provided for by Franz Liszt, Joseph Joachim and others, who gave him the receipts of a concert tour amounting to some 100,000 marks.\nIn 1878 or 1879, he made an extensive search for Bach manuscripts in various towns, villages and country houses in Germany. Supposedly, he discovered a park surrounding Schloss Witzthun where young trees were being protected from their supporting poles by paper instead of the customary cloth or leather. On examination, the paper turned out to be Bach manuscripts. After questioning the gardener, Franz found a trunk of them, including a number of violin sonatas. Although this account was printed in the \"New York Times\", Franz declared it was \"entirely untrue\".\n\nIn addition to songs, he set the 117th Psalm for double choir and wrote and a four-part Kyrie; he also edited Emanuele d'Astorga's \"Stabat Mater\" and Francesco Durante's \"Magnificat\". He also transcribed Schubert's String Quartet in D minor (\"Death and the Maiden\") for piano duet (1878) and made arrangements of Mozart's Quintets in C minor and C major.\n\nHe died in Halle.\n\n"}

He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, and at St John's College, Oxford. In 1719 he was expelled from the university, ostensibly for his irregularities of conduct, but in reality (according to his own account) because of his whig principles. His politics were sufficiently evident in many of his works: a congratulatory epistle to Addison, in \"Protestant Popery\"; or the \"Convocation\" (1718), an attack on the opponents of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly; and in The Protestant Session by a member of the Constitution Club at Oxford (1719), addressed to James, first Earl Stanhope, and printed anonymously, but doubtless by Amhurst.\n\nHe had satirized Oxford morals in \"Strepkon's Revenge; a Satire on the Oxford Toasts\" (1718), and he attacked from time to time the administration of the university and its principal members. An old Oxford custom permitted, on public occasions, some person to deliver from the rostrum a humorous, satirical speech, full of university scandal. This orator was known as \"Terræ filius\". In 1721 Amhurst produced a series of bi-weekly satirical papers under this name, which ran for seven months and incidentally provides much curious information. These publications were reprinted in 1726 in two volumes as \"\". He collected his poems in 1720, and wrote another university satire, \"Oculus Britanniæ\", in 1724.\nOn leaving Oxford for London he became a prominent pamphleteer on the opposition (whig) side. On the 5 December 1726 he issued the first number of \"The Craftsman\", a weekly periodical, which he conducted under the pseudonym of Caleb D'Anvers. The paper was aimed mainly towards the overthrow of Sir Robert Walpole's government; there is some debate about its effects, with most historians agreeing it did little more than preaching to the converted. Nevertheless, it reached a circulation of 10,000 copies and was one of the biggest magazines of its time with authors such as Henry Fielding, John Gay and Alexander Pope contributing to it. For this success Amhurst's editorship was not perhaps chiefly responsible. It was founded, and in the beginning financed, by Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke and William Pulteney, the latter being a frequent and caustic contributor. In 1737 an imaginary letter from Colley Cibber was inserted, in which he was made to suggest that many plays by Shakespeare and the older dramatists contained passages which might be regarded as seditious. He therefore desired to be appointed censor of all plays brought on the stage. This was regarded as a \"suspected\" libel, and a warrant was issued for the arrest of the printer. Amhurst surrendered himself instead, and suffered a short imprisonment. On the overthrow of the government in 1742 the opposition leaders did nothing for the useful editor of the \"Craftsman\", and this neglect is said to have hastened Amhurst's death, which took place at Twickenham.\n\n"}

It had also broadcast Vietnamese programs during the weekend.\nThe station was unprofitable, and was subsequently sold to Silver King Broadcasting, the broadcasting arm of the Home Shopping Network, in 1987. The station changed its call letters to KHSH in November of that year, and began airing home shopping programming 24 hours a day.\n\nThere were plans to revert KHSH into a general entertainment independent station by 2001, under the local programming-infused \"City Vision\" format developed by USA Broadcasting (which assumed control of the Silver King stations in the mid-1990s), in which the station would have mixed locally produced programming, alongside first-run and off-network syndicated programs (including those produced by USA Broadcasting sister company Studios USA) and had already been adopted by its stations in cities such as Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Miami. However those plans changed in 2000, when USA Broadcasting announced that it would sell off its television station group. The Walt Disney Company made a bid to acquire the group (which had it purchased the USA stations, would have created a duopoly locally between KHSH and KTRK-TV), but was outbid by Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications. Once the purchase was finalized in 2001, most of the former USA stations, including KHSH, were used as charter owned-and-operated stations of Univision's new secondary broadcast network, Telefutura (which rebranded as UniMás in January 2013) when it launched on January 14, 2002. On that date, the station changed its call letters to KFTH-TV.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKFTH-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 67, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36, using PSIP to display KFTH-TV's virtual channel as 67 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nOn April 4, 2011, sister station KXLN began producing a weekday morning news program for KFTH, called \"Vive La Mañana\". Like the newscasts on KXLN-DT, it is broadcast in high definition, and is produced out of the station's current news set.

{"id": "2305135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305135", "title": "Velakali", "text": "Velakali\n\nVelakali (Malayalam: വേലകളി) is a traditional martial dance of Nair community of Kerala that is performed during temple festivals. Brightly dressed dancers wielding swords and shields depict a fight sequence between the Pandavas and Kauravas during the course of the dance.\n\nThere are several legends associated with the origin and history of Velakali. One such legend talks of the sage Narada witnessing Lord Krishna and his friends staging a mock battle on the banks of the Kalindi using the stalks and leaves of the water lily as swords and shields. Narada then requested the sage Villumangalam to capture the martial vigour of the mock fight in a ritualistic performance for Krishna. Villumangalam in turn requested the ruler of Ambalapuzha to teach young men to perform the dance and so the ruler asked his army chieftains Mathoor Panicker and Velloor Kurup to ready a troupe of Velakali performers. Since the dancers were originally warriors, the dance bore a close resemblance to the martial art form of Kalarippayattu.\nVelakali thus originated in the princely state of Chempakassery (modern Ambalappuzha). To this day it is a regular feature of the pooram at the Ambalapuzha Sri Krishnaswamy temple. Since the annexation of Ambalappuzha into Travancore, Velakali has marked the commencement of the annual Painkuni festival at Sri Padmanabha Swamy Temple, Trivandrum.\n\nDuring a Velakali performance huge effigies representing the Pandavas are put up during the festival at the eastern entrance of the Padmanabhaswamy temple. In Ambalapuzha, the dance is choreographed under the guidance of Mathur Panickar a hereditary Asan and minister of the Ambalapuzha royal family. Velakali dancers represent the Kauravas and the dance represents the battle between the cousins. The dancers stop and beat a retreat once they reach the effigy of Yudhishthira. The performance represents the victory of \"dharma\" over \"adharma\" and the victory of Bheema over the Kauravas during their exile to the forest. The younger performers line up in the front and the elders make up the rear of the troupe with a group of flag bearers forming the rearmost line. The performers are also sometimes accompanied by replicas of animals like oxen that were used in warfare in the olden days. According to Alf Hiltebeitel, Velakali performances in central Travancore are reenactments of supposedly historical battles rather than the Mahabharata war and are intertwined with rituals of patayani. It is at the Padmanabhaswamy temple that the performances are linked with the battle between the cousins of the Mahabharata.\n\nVelakali is an all-male performance. The performers dress up in traditional clothes and colorful red headgear of the medieval Nair soldiers and wear cloth garlands of beads that cover their bare chests. They wield colorful shields and long canes or bear swords and dance to the beat of panchavadyam performers who accompany the performance and there are skilful displays of swordplay.\n\nVelakali is performed to the accompaniment of \"panchavadyam\" which uses the \"maddalam\", \"thavil\", \"ilathalam\", \"kombu\" and \"kuzhal\". The music involves no lyrics and the artists move to the rhythm of the percussion instruments. Also, unlike most dance forms, \"bhava\" has no place in Velakali and the focus is solely on \"tala\". Velakali involves several distinct movements such as the \"pidichakali\", \"padakali\" and the \"vela ottam\".\n\nVelakali requires of its performers considerable physical training and the knowledge of the use of arms. Education and employment opportunities had gradually led to fewer youngsters taking up Velakali resulting in its gradual decline. It has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years due to the efforts of Mohanankunju Panicker. The dance was staged again at the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Trivandrum in 2011 after a gap of almost 40 years.\n\n"}

It later changed its call letters to KVVV (a callsign formerly used on now-defunct channel 16 from 1968 to 1969) in 1994, when it switched to home shopping programming from Valuevision; it then became a FamilyNet affiliate as KAZH in 2000.\n\nDuring its time as KAZH, the station was rebroadcast in Houston on translators KHMV-CA (channel 28) and KVVV-LP (channel 53); both of these translators were taken off the air in November 2007, due to owner Pappas Telecasting's ongoing financial problems (KHMV-CA was sold to Uniglobe Central America Network LLC on March 10, 2010, and currently broadcasts under the call sign KUGB-CD; KVVV-LP was spun off to a liquidation trust and returned to the air in digital format in January 2012).\n\nIn 2002, KAZH affiliated with Spanish-language network Azteca América. Early in 2007, then-owner Pappas Telecasting terminated KAZH's affiliation agreement with Azteca América, effective July 1. Azteca América programming moved to a low-powered station, KUVM-CA; and later, to another full-powered station, KYAZ (channel 51) on date to June 30, 2007. KAZH then joined Pappas' independent Spanish-language network, TuVisión.\n\nOn May 10, 2008, thirteen of Pappas' stations, including KAZH, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Pappas cited \"the extremely difficult business climate for television stations across the country\" in papers filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Pappas was later ordered on September 10, 2008 to sell off the affected stations by February 15, 2009. In January 2009, the Pappas stations involved in the bankruptcy auction, including KAZH, were sold to New World TV Group, after the sale received bankruptcy court approval. On October 22, 2009, KAZH became the first affiliate of VasalloVision, a new network founded by Carlos Vasallo and Miguel Banojian; this followed the closure of TuVisión.\n\nCiting a larger advertising market, the station changed to an English-language general entertainment independent format on September 27, 2010. The station's call sign changed to KUBE-TV on the same date.\n\nOn January 18, 2013, NRJ TV announced that it would acquire KUBE-TV from New World TV Group for $19 million, as part of a two-station deal that also included San Francisco sister station KTNC-TV.\n\nOn December 9, 2019, it was announced that WRNN-TV Associates, owner of New York City-based WRNN-TV, secured a deal to purchase seven full-power TV stations (including KUBE-TV) and one Class A station from NRJ. The sale was approved by the FCC on January 23, and was completed on February 4, 2020.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nDuring the 2011 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, KUBE-TV added programming from PegasusTV on subchannel 57.4; this was replaced by MeTV in 2012. Cozi TV was added to 57.4 on May 28, 2018.\n\nKUBE-TV (as KAZH) discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 57, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 41, using PSIP to display KUBE-TV's virtual channel as 57 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nSyndicated programming seen on KUBE-TV included \"Rachael Ray,\" \"The Doctors\", \"The Middle\", \"The King of Queens\", \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", \"Seinfeld\", \"Cougar Town\", \"Hot Bench\", Lauren Lake's \"Paternity Court\", \"Judge Faith\", \"Forensic Files\", \"Justice with Judge Mablean\", \"Bridezillas\", \"Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen\", \"Community\", \"Family Guy\", and \"Bob's Burgers\". As of the 2017 season, KUBE is the home of the MLS club Houston Dynamo. Until 2019, the station carried NCAA college football and men's basketball games from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\n\n"}
{"id": "2305151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305151", "title": "Another Suitcase in Another Hall", "text": "Another Suitcase in Another Hall\n\n\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" is a song recorded by Scottish singer Barbara Dickson, for the 1976 concept album, \"Evita\", the basis of the musical of the same name. The musical was based on the life of Argentinian leader Eva Perón. Written by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, the song is presented during a sequence where Eva throws out her husband's mistress on the streets. The latter sings the track, wondering about her future and coming to the conclusion that she would be fine. Dickson was enlisted by the songwriters to record the track after hearing her previous work.\n\nRice and Webber asked her to record the song using a higher than usual pitch, so that she sounded younger like her character. Featuring instrumentation from guitar, marimba, harp and keyboard, \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" finds Dickson singing in a soprano voice. Critically appreciated, the song was released as a single on 7 February 1977, and reached number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. Dickson has stated that she did not like her recorded version of the track and employed a different arrangement during her future live renditions.\n\nThe song has been covered and performed many times by other artists, namely Elaine Paige, Marti Webb, Kimberley Walsh from British girl group Girls Aloud, as well as actress Samantha Barks. Another notable version was recorded by American singer Madonna who played the part of Eva for the 1996 film adaptation of the musical. It was released on 3 March 1997, by Warner Bros. as the third and final single from the film's soundtrack. Unlike the musical, in the film the track was sung by Madonna's character instead of the mistress. Upon its release, the song garnered positive response from music critics and reached the top-ten of the charts in Italy and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were developing the \"Evita\" for Broadway in 1976. Both were extremely intrigued by the stories surrounding the life of Eva Perón while researching about her during the mid-1970s. They came to know about her husband Juan Perón, and his affinity for young women, and Rice and Webber decided to use it as one of the backstories behind Eva and Juan's rise to power. In the original musical, the song is performed by the character of Juan's teenage mistress (played by Siobhán McCarthy) after she is \"kicked out\" by his future wife, Eva. According to director Michael Grandage, the story took the \"edge off\" a supposed fairy tale like interpretation of Eva and Juan, unveiling their ambitions and cut-throat personality. From a production point-of-view, it also allowed Grandage to show ruthlessness of Eva, when Juan allows her to throw his \"mistress\" away. The girl is ultimately left on the streets with nowhere to go, and there she sings the song.\n\nIt is a particularly poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly knew what she was doing sleeping with an older man, and yet there is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.\n\n\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" was first recorded by singer Barbara Dickson in 1976 for the \"Evita\" concept album that eventually became the stage musical; Dickson did not appear in the musical itself. Rice and Webber had already enlisted actress Julie Covington to sing the part of Eva, hence they were on the look-out for other supporting vocal personnel. They found about Dickson who had recently starred in the Willy Russell musical, \"John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert\", and had charted on the UK Singles Chart with her cover version of the David Whitfield and Frankie Laine song, \"Answer Me\" (1976). Dickson and her manager, Bernard Theobald, had a discussion with Rice and Webber about starring in the musical, but her voice was declared \"too delicate\" for singing the numbers on \"Evita\". So they offered her one-song which was not sung by Eva's character, and that was \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\".\n\nDickson recalled that during the recording sessions, Webber asked her to sing in a higher range than her usual, since the \"mistress\" character was a teenager, and should have sounded younger. Before the sequence of the eviction of the mistress occurs in Act I of the musical, Eva's character sings the song \"Hello and goodbye\" and then \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" begins. A soft strummed guitar in broken chord patterns heralds the introductory music. Dickson sings the opening verse, and the chorus which is repeated twice as she asks, \"So, what happens now?\" and wonders about her immediate future, ultimately concluding that she would survive. For the second verse, the lyrics reflect on this recurring pattern of being evicted out of men's lives, and the final verses have a more positive outlook toward's the subject's life. The song finishes with the mistress asking the question, \"Where am I going to?\" as a male voice pacifies by saying, \"Don't ask, anymore\". In 2004, author Rikky Rooksby released the book, \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna\", where he wrote his thoughts about the popularity of the song:\n\nEva is the center of attention [in the song] but the lyric does not allow a transfer of meaning outside of the context of her story. Part of the song's popularity lies in the way it finds an image—the suitcase in the hall—to express the nomadic nature of modern civilization, the feeling of urban rootlessness that many people experience. The theme of constant moving strikes a resonant note.\n\n\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" features instrumentation from guitar, marimba, harp and keyboard, with Dickson singing in a soprano voice. Author Mark Ross Clark noted in his book, \"The Broadway Song: A Singer's Guide\", that her vocals portrayed different kind of emotions, with standard pitch correction in the lower middle C. Her vocals contrast the lyrics with an \"underlying coolness\", while the light voice enabled Dickson to sing the lines \"So, what happens now?\" in sixteenth note, Emajor. The song is high-pitched to make its syllables appear as difficult to sing.\n\nAfter the first single from the \"Evita\" album, \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\", achieved commercial success, \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" was released as the second single on 7 February 1977. A reviewer from \"Melody Maker\" complimented the song, saying that without the context of \"Evita\", the song was more acceptable and was \"poignant and lovely. How lucky Lloyd Webber and Rice are to have Julie Covington and now Dickson, to add the flesh and bones to songs which might otherwise be wrecks of soppy melodrama. A smash hit.\" It was Dickson's second single to chart on the UK Singles Chart, following \"Answer Me\" in 1976, and entered the chart at number 44 in its first week and peaked at number 18 in its fifth week. It was present for a total of seven weeks on the chart.\n\nDue to the high-pitch employed in the recording, Dickson reflected in later years that she \"never liked the original [track] for that reason. The song has seasoned over the years with my singing of it.\" Dickson believed that she did not sound like herself on the song. While performing it later point of time on her concerts, Dickson sang it in her actual tone, saying that although the track \"might have been written for a teenage girl, but the experience of being abandoned by a man is one, women of all ages can relate to. I think you have to be honest with songs and with yourself.\" The singer's music director Ian Lynn arranged the track differently which she performs currently.\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the single's liner notes.\n\nEnglish singer Elaine Paige recorded the song for her 1983 album \"Stages\". Sarah Brightman, who was married to Webber from 1984 to 1990, included the song on her album \"The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection\". Marti Webb's version of the song was included in the 1995 album \"Music & Songs From Evita\". English musician Hank Marvin included an instrumental version of the song on his 1997 tribute album \"Hank Marvin and the Shadows Play the Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice\". Kimberley Walsh, from British girl group Girls Aloud, covered the song for her debut studio album \"Centre Stage\" (2013). Singer Hayley Westenra included the song on her 2000 album \"Walking in the Air\". On the tribute show \"Andrew Lloyd Webber: 40 Musical Years\", the song was performed by actress Samantha Barks. British singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor performed the track along the BBC Concert Orchestra on Rice's homage \"Tim Rice: An Evening In Song\" on July 8th, 2014.\n\nIn 1996, Madonna starred in the film adaptation of the musical, titled \"Evita\", playing the role of Eva; she had desired to play the part for a long time and even wrote to director Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since \"Evita\" required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer \"had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. \"Evita\" is real musical theater — its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had.\" Unlike the musical, in the film the song is performed by Eva after ending her relationship with Agustín Magaldi, deciding she wants to improve her life. The song was not promoted and only a video was created using footage and scenes from the film.\n\nRecording sessions for the film's songs and soundtrack began in September 1995, and took place at the CTS Studios in London with Madonna accompanied by co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. However, trouble arose as Madonna was not comfortable with laying down a \"guide vocal\" simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not have musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part in a more contemporary studio while the orchestration would take place somewhere else. She also had alternate days off from the recording.\n\nMadonna's version of the song begins with the same soft strummed guitar in broken chords. Madonna sings in a breathy voice, giving her character more vulnerability. The first vocal entrance leads into an engaging melody with the opening phrase, \"so what happens now?\", being repeated twice. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a slow tempo of 50 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major, with Madonna's vocals spanning from A to E. The song has a sequence of C–F when Madonna sings the opening verse \"I don't expect my love affairs to last for long\".\n\nThe song was officially released as the soundtrack's third single on 3 March 1997. Originally, there were talks about releasing an \"Evita\" EP, containing remixed versions of \"Buenos Aires\", \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" and \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\", but it did not materialize. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, the week of 29 March 1997, and was present on the top 100 for a total of 8 weeks. According to the Official Charts Company, the single had sold 75,233 copies in the United Kingdom as of August 2008. The song also reached a peak of number 23 on the Irish Singles Chart, where it remained for 3 weeks. Elsewhere, it had a relatively poor chart performance; in Sweden it peaked at number 60, while in the Netherlands it peaked at number 91. \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" was Madonna's first single released in Australia to miss the ARIA top 100.\n\nAllMusic's Jose F. Promis, wrote that \"the song finds Madonna giving an understated and inspired performance [...] One hopes that this overlooked gem might find its way onto future [Madonna] hits collections, because it is truly a wonderful song\". Author Thomas S. Hischak called it \"plaintive\". \"Billboard\"s Geoff Burpee called it \"A sterling, intimate moment from the \"Evita\" soundtrack. Yes kids, she \"can\" sing\". Writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", David Gritten opined Madonna's voice sounded \"pitch-perfect and clear as a bell\". Greg Morago, from the \"Hartford Courant\", felt that \"By giving her 'Another Suitcase' with its heartbreaking 'Where am I going to?' refrain, Madonna adds a necessary, fragile vulnerability to her ambitious, rags- to-riches Eva Peron\". Neil Strauss from \"The Herald Journal\", said that \"Madonna radiates on 'Another Suitcase in Another Hall'\". \n\nPeter Keough, from the \"Boston Phoenix\", described the track as \"a poignant, winsome exploration of pathos, defilement, and resolution sung by a young, struggling Eva forced into prostitution with a series of drab johns\".\n\"The Guardian\"s Jude Rogers wrote that \"Madonna’s wavering vocal goes full collywobbles\"; placing the track at number 69 on her ranking of the singer's singles, in honor of her 60th birthday. Finally, \"Billboard\" picked it as the singer's 98th greatest single; \"the delicate composition and high-register vocal make this exquisite breakup ballad a rare moment of true fragility in Madonna's catalog\". \"Slant Magazine\"s Paul Schrodt placed it at number 77 in his ranking of the singer's singles, calling it \"a sleepy travelogue set to schmaltzy acoustic guitar and saxophone and a male chorus echoing Eva Perón’s —and by extension Madonna’s— self-pitying complaints about moving from one place to another. Political and psychological nuance, meanwhile, are nowhere in sight\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2305154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305154", "title": "HMS Euryalus (1803)", "text": "HMS Euryalus (1803)\n\nHMS \"Euryalus\" was a Royal Navy 36-gun frigate, which saw service in the Battle of Trafalgar and the War of 1812. During her career she was commanded by three prominent naval personalities of the Napoleonic and post-Napoleonic period, Henry Blackwood, George Dundas and Charles Napier. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars she continued on active service for a number of years, before spending more than two decades as a prison hulk. She ended her career in Gibraltar where, in 1860, she was sold for breaking up.\n\n\"Euryalus\" was built by Henry Adams's firm at Buckler's Hard, and launched in 1803. Her first action occurred on 2 and 3 October 1804 when, captained by Henry Blackwood, she participated in an attack on French vessels off Boulogne pier. During Blackwood's absence, Captain J. Hardy temporarily commanded her.\n\nOn 22 February 1805, \"Euryalus\" captured \"St Jose\" while on the Irish station. shared in the prize by agreement with \"Euryalus\".\n\nIn March \"Euryalus\" pressed four men of the 41 men and boys on the Liverpool privateer . \"Eliza\"s owners sued Blackwood for £3000, contending that Blackwood's action in ignoring the Admiralty Certificate of Protection covering \"Eliza\"s crew had ended up costing them that much in prize money by reducing their share of the proceeds from a rich Spanish prize they took in April. The prize money was shared with the privateer \"Greyhound\", which had participated in the capture, on the basis of the sizes of the two crews. despite the judge's leading instructions to the jury that emphasized Blackwood's service to England, the jury found for the plaintiffs.. \n\nIn 1805 she led a squadron of four other frigates in watching Cádiz to report the movements of the combined French and Spanish fleets anchored there. The combined fleet sailed from Cádiz on 20 October, shadowed through the night by \"Euryalus\" and the others that reported its position to the Royal Navy fleet on the horizon.\n\nWith battle imminent the following morning, Captain Blackwood suggested that Admiral Horatio Nelson transfer from to the faster \"Euryalus\", the better to observe and control the engagement. Nelson declined the offer. \"Euryalus\" - too small to play a major role - stood off until the late afternoon when she took the badly damaged in tow and turned her to engage the French ship .\n\nFollowing the death of Admiral Nelson, Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood transferred his flag from \"Royal Sovereign\" to \"Euryalus\". She became for the next ten days the British fleet's flagship.\n\nAfter the battle \"Euryalus\" took on survivors from the French ship-of-the-line , as well as the captured French Admiral Pierre de Villeneuve. Blackwood also received the surrender of the Spanish ship , after two raking broadsides to the stern by \"Royal Sovereign\" and had caused her to strike her colours.\n\n\"Euryalus\" again took \"Royal Sovereign\" in tow but the two ships collided during a sudden squall, badly damaging the frigate's masts and rigging. Once repairs were completed, \"Euryalus\" went into Cádiz Harbour to allow Blackwood to negotiate an exchange of prisoners and the repatriation of French and Spanish wounded. On 31 October, \"Euryalus\" set sail for England with Admiral Villeneuve as a prisoner. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \"Trafalgar\" to all surviving claimants from the battle.\n\nOn 5 February 1806 Blackwood was still in command of \"Euryalus\" when the privateer \"Mayflower\", of Guernsey, captured the Spanish vessel \"San Jose Andrea\". This gave rise to court case in which the captain of the privateer alleged that \"Eurylaus\" had not been in sight (and so entitled to share in the prize money), but had come on the scene later and that Blackwood had coerced him to sign that she had joined the chase and was in sight. The court found for \"Euryalus\" having been in sight.\n\nLater that year George Dundas took command of \"Euryalus\". \"Euryalus\", and other warships escorted a large convoy to Oporto, Lisbon and the Mediterranean. When she arrived, she was assigned to patrol the coast between Cape St. Vincent and Cape St. Maria in the Algarve, and then to watch the port of Cartagena. After about four months she transferred to the Gulf of Lyons. In the Mediterranean her boats captured several small merchant vessels.\n\nTowards the end of 1807 \"Euryalus\" returned to England with . The two vessels escorted several thousand of the late Sir John Moore's troops from Gibraltar. On her return \"Euryalus\" went into dock at Plymouth for a refit.\n\nHer next station was the North Sea and then the Baltic under Vice-Admiral Sir James Saumarez. First, \"Euryalus\" transported the Duke d'Angoulême from Yarmouth to Gottenburg. She then escorted Baltic convoys through the Great Belt.\n\nOn 11 June 1808, she and discovered several vessels at anchor close to shore at the entrance to the river Naskon. Dundas anchored at dark and sent a cutting out party in four boats from the two ships to destroy the vessels. The cutting out party burnt two large troop transports and retrieved a gun-vessel armed with two 18-pounders and carrying 64 men. The successful foray took place directly under the guns of a Danish battery of three 18-pounder guns and numerous enemy troops who lined the shore. The enemy lost seven men killed and twelve wounded; the British had one man slightly wounded. In 1816 the crews of the British ships received prize money for \"Danish gun-boat E\".\n\nLater that year Dundas sailed to Elbing, a small port in West Prussia about east of Dantzig. There he took on board Princess Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy (the consort of Louis XVIII), the Duc du Berry and other members of the French royal family. He carried them first to Carlscrona in southern Sweden. He then re-embarked them at Gottenburg and carried them to Harwich.\n\nOn 30 July 1809, a British force of 39,000 men landed on Walcheren, initiating the Walcheren Campaign. \"Euryalus\" joined the squadron under Captain Lord William Stuart in that on 11 August forced the passage of the Scheldt between the batteries at Flushing and Cadsand. \"Euryalus\" herself had no casualties although the British lost two men killed and nine wounded in other ships. Although the Walcheren Expedition, which ended on 9 August 1809, was notably unsuccessful, \"Euryalus\" was among the myriad vessels sharing in the prize money form the campaign.\n\nLater she was stationed off Cherbourg under the orders of Captain Sir Richard King. On 18 November \"Euryalus\" was off Cherbourg where she captured the French privateer lugger \"Etoile\" of 14 guns and 48 men. \"Etoile\" was two days out from the Hogue without having made any captures.\n\nOn 26 April 1810 \"Euryalus\" sailed for the Mediterranean, escorting a large convoy from Spithead to Portugal and the Mediterranean. She then joined Captain Blackwood's inshore squadron off Toulon. The squadron consisted of Blackwood's , , , \"Euryalus\" and . A strong gale on 15 July forced the squadron to seek shelter behind the Île du Levant. The same gale drove Blackwood's ship, east to Villefranche.\n\nOn 20 July a French squadron consisting of six sail-of-the line and four frigates exited Toulon. Their objective was to provide cover to a frigate and her convoy that wished to escape from Bandol where it had taken shelter. The light and variable winds made it impossible for Blackwood to block the French squadron and the frigate and her convoy from joining up. Furthermore, while Blackwood was trying to regroup his squadron, \"Euryalus\" and \"Shearwater\" were forced to sail across the front of the French force. The wind failed for Blackwood, but not the French, making it highly likely that the French would be able to capture \"Euryalus\" and \"Shearwater\".\n\nBlackwood was able to position \"Warspite\" with \"Conqueror\" and \"Ajax\" astern where they could exchange broadsides with the French ships as they came up one at a time. Then the French tacked and the British line matched them, enabling \"Euryalus\" and \"Shearwater\" to escape, though not before \"Shearwater\" was on the receiving end of three completely ineffectual broadsides from one of the French ships of the line and a frigate. Despite its greater strength, the French force returned to Toulon rather than take on the British squadron.\n\nEarly in 1811 Dundas temporarily took command of the 74-gun third rate until relieved by Captain Aiskew Paffard Hollis, who had transferred from . Dundas then returned to \"Euryalus\".\n\nOn 16 April 1811, \"Euryalus\" sailed for the Mediterranean. By May 1811, she was under the command of Captain George Waldegrave.\n\nOn 7 June 1811 \"Euryalus\", again under the command of Dundas, and sent their boats in pursuit of a French privateer off Corsica. After a long chase the boats captured \"Intrepide\", which had a crew of 58 and was armed with two 8-pounders.\n\nIn November 1812 Captain Thomas Ussher took command. His successor was Captain Jeremiah Coghlan. On 2 April, \"Euryalus\", under Coghlan, drove a French vessel on shore on the coast of Sardinia.\n\n\"Euryalus\" was still in the Mediterranean when Captain (later Admiral) Charles Napier took command early in 1813. She took part in successful commerce raiding and the blockade of Toulon. On 16 May 1813, boats from and \"Euryalus\" attacked French coastal shipping at Cavalaire, east of Toulon. There they captured the French naval xebec \"Fortune\", of ten 9-pounder guns and four swivel guns. She was under the command of \"Lieutenant de Vaisseaux\" Félix-Marie-Louise-Anne-Joseph-Julien Lecamus, and had a crew of 95 men who had abandoned her before the British boarded. In addition, the British captured 22 small coasting vessels. They took out 14, but then destroyed nine after removing their cargoes. Fifteen of the vessels were chiefly laden with oil, corn, lemons, etc., and one with empty casks; six of those destroyed were empty. In the attack \"Berwick\" lost one man killed, and \"Euryalus\" had one man missing.\n\nOn 23 December \"Euryalus\" drove the flüte , sailing from Toulon to Ajaccio, ashore near Calvi where she bilged on the rocks. \"Baleine\" was armed with 22 guns and carried a crew of 120 men. That same day, \"Alcmene\" captured the \"Flèche\" between Corsica and Cape Delle Molle. \"Flèche\" was armed with 12 guns, and carried a crew of 99 men and 24 soldiers. She was carrying the soldiers from Toulon to Corsica. French records place the capture off Vintimilles, and add that \"Flèche\" was escorting the storeships and \"Baleine\", which were also carrying troops for Ajaccio, Corsica.\n\nOn 21 April 1814, in company with , under the command of Ussher, \"Euryalus\" entered the harbour at Marseilles where they heard the news of Napoleon's defeat. \"Undaunted\" then sailed to Frejus Bay where she embarked Napoleon and transported him to Elba.\n\nNapier next took \"Euryalus\" across the Atlantic to serve in the War of 1812. In June she sailed from Gibraltar to Bermuda as part of a squadron under Captain Andrew King. The squadron escorted transports carrying troops that had been recently employed against Genoa.\n\nNext, Napier and \"Euryalus\" participated in the expedition up the Potomac (August–September 1814), in which he was second in command of the squadron under James Alexander Gordon. On 17 August \"Euryalus\", bombs , , and \"Meteor\", the rocket ship , and the dispatch boat \"Anna-Maria\" were detached under Captain Gordon of to sail up the Potomac River and bombard Fort Washington, about ten or twelve miles below the capital. On the second day of the expedition \"Euryalus\" went aground on an oyster-bank at Kettle Bottoms and took several hours to be floated off.\n\nShe subsequently took part in the bombardment and reduction of the forts defending the town of Alexandria. Later \"Euryalus\" contributed a boat armed with a howitzer to assist \"Meteor\" and in their unsuccessful attempt to stop the Americans from adding guns to a battery that would impede the British withdrawal. On 25 August a vicious squall hit the whole squadron; it temporarily put \"Euryalus\" almost on her beam ends and cost her bowsprit and the heads of all her topmasts. Only 12 hours were needed for refit, however.\n\nThen on 5 September, \"Seahorse\" and \"Euryalus\" anchored close to the American battery and silenced it with their fire. With the rest of the squadron she then descended the Potomac, running the gauntlet of fire from enemy batteries; in all \"Euryalus\" lost three killed and ten wounded. One of the wounded was Napier, who took a musket ball in the neck. She returned to her anchorage at the mouth of the river on 9 September. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \"The Potomac 17 Augt. 1814\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign.\n\nOn 13 September \"Euryalus\" was present at the bombardment of Fort McHenry preparatory to an expedition against Baltimore. Napier led nine boats up the Patapsco River where they fired on the American troops and drew fire from Fort McHenry that killed one man.\n\nFollowing these operations, on 28 January 1815 Napier issued a challenge to the captain of the frigate to meet \"Euryalus\" in single-ship combat. \"Constellation\"s captain, Charles Gordon, accepted, but \"Euryalus\" was first required for the naval operations preceding the Battle of New Orleans and then peace was signed before the engagement could take place. Napier wrote to Captain Gordon that he was glad they were at peace, but should that situation change 'I trust we shall have an opportunity of being better acquainted'.\n\nDuring Napoleon's Hundred Days \"Euryalus\" landed troops at the mouth of the River Scheldt.\n\n\"Euryalus\" was paid off in June 1815.

She served as the flagship in the Leeward Islands from November 1819 to May 1820, and then at Jamaica from June to December.\n\nIn January 1821 Captain Isaac Chapman became acting captain. From about June 1821 to August she was under the command of Wilson Braddyll Bigland.\n\nCaptain Sir Augustus Clifford was appointed to \"Euryalus\" on 22 October 1821 and sailed her from St Helen's with W.J. Hamilton, the British ambassador to the Neapolitan court. She would spend from 1822 to 1825 relatively uneventfully in the Mediterranean though in 1824 she participated in the blockade of Algiers. Then in late in 1824 or early in 1825, she rendered assistance to the American brig \"Charles and Ellen\" at the island of Milos. \"Euryalus\" stayed for a week, lending some 70 to 80 men to the brig to effect repairs, a kindness acknowledged her captain, P.R. Bing and two Boston insurance companies by posting a notice in the \"National Intelligencer\" of 23 March 1825. \"Euryalus\" was paid off at Deptford in 1825.\n\nAfter her return to England \"Euryalus\" was converted to a prison hulk. From 1825 to at least 1843, she was a prison for boys, the youngest being nine years old.\n\nIn 1845 \"Euryalus\" became a coal hulk at Sheerness. In 1846-7 she was refitted as a convict ship and in that capacity she was moved to Gibraltar. In 1859 she was renamed \"Africa\" but was sold to a Mr. Recanno for breaking up in 1860.\n\n\n"}

In 1999, the ship was discovered by the members of Pro Vrouw Maria, led by Rauno Koivusaari. A dispute between the discoverers and the authorities was later resolved. The ship was in good condition when it was discovered, but only six objects from the deck of the ship have been salvaged. The cargo holds have not been disturbed, so the condition of any art on board remains unknown. The Finnish National Board of Antiquities is responsible for the ship and all recovery efforts.\n\n\"Vrouw Maria\" was loaded with precious artifacts including works of art belonging to Catherine the Great of Russia. The ship set sail from Amsterdam on September 5, 1771, for Saint Petersburg. One month later, on October 3, the ship was caught in a storm and ran aground near the island of Jurmo. The rocks caused only minor damage but shortly afterward the ship ran aground again and lost its rudder. The ship was released by a large wave but the crew found it leaking rapidly. Lowering anchor, the crewmen manned the pumps, but the ship continued to take on water. \n\nAt dawn on October 4, the decision was made to abandon ship. The crew manned the ship's boats and safely reached nearby rocks, from which they hailed a passing boat. Help arrived the next day, but after several days no progress had been made toward stabilizing the ship, whose pump was clogged with coffee beans from the cargo. On the morning of October 9, the \"Vrouw Maria\" sank beneath the waves. While all the crew lived, only a fraction of the cargo was saved.\n\nVarious people tried to locate the wreck, but none were successful until Pro Vrouw Maria discovered it in 1999. Interest in the ship rose in the 1970s when Dr. Christian Ahlström discovered documents regarding the incident in the national archives of Finland. He published his findings in a book called \"Sjunkna Skepp\" in 1979.\n\nThe cargo, as declared in Helsingør, Denmark, on September 23, included sugar, fabrics and dyes. The ship also carried works of art that Catherine the Great had bought at auction in Amsterdam, July 31, 1771. The pieces formerly belonged to Gerrit Braamcamp, a Dutch art collector. The King of Denmark allowed them to pass through customs without any declaration. After the sinking, the Swedish ambassador to St Petersburg, Carl Ribbing, the landlord of Turku and Pori County baron Christopher Rappe, and the foreign minister of Russia, Nikita Panin, discussed the missing cargo but nothing further was done to save it. The paintings Catherine the Great bought are known to have included Paulus Potter's \"Large Herd of Oxen,\" bought for Fl. 9050, and Gerard ter Borch's \"Woman at her Toilette\", bought for Fl. 1870, as well as works by Cornelis Coedyk, Gabriel Metsu, Gerard Dou (a triptych of genre scenes bought for Fl. 14,100), Philip Wouwerman, and one of the van Ostade brothers (Adriaen or Isaac).\n\nPickford, Nigel.

The district is bordered by County Meath to the west and the north-west and by the Ratoath Road to the north-east. The land between the Ratoath Road / Cappagh Road and the M2 / N2 road lies in the Dublin 11 postal district. The townland of Ashtown and the boundary walls of the Phoenix Park is the district's eastern boundary.

The attitude of the citizens can be summarised as pessimistic at the turn of the century due to the handover, and gradually decreasing over time.\n\nAfter the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong faced a series of problems, both political and economical. The government carried out a series of reforms to adopt a more modern ideology and democracy, but faced many difficulties. Despite a transfer of power to China, the citizens participate in how their government is run, and the region maintains some degree of autonomy. Media in Hong Kong has not come under state control, though many citizens believe the media practices self-censorship. The economy would also begin the period with a rise in unemployment rate from 2.2% in 1997 to 4.4% in 2000, and 7.9% in 2003. The economy had gradually recovered since 2004 and the overall unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in 2008, however the overall figure rose again to 5.4% in 2009 due to the global economic downturn in the last quarter of 2008.\n\nThe two major political camps of the decade are the Pro-Beijing camp and the Pro-democracy camp.\n\nIn 2003, the government proposed an anti-subversion law titled Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law. Many people feared that the proposal would erode freedom of press, religion, and association. The unpopularity of Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa and his administration, combined with the dissatisfaction about economy recession and the pandemic control, prompted an estimated 500,000 - 1,000,000 people to march on 1 July 2003, making it the largest since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The proposal fell after the several pro-government lawmakers withdrew their support to pass the bill. The resignation of Liberal Party chief James Tien from the Executive Council on 6 July 2003 caused the eventual withdrawal of the legislation and the break-up of the \"ruling alliance\" of the Chief Executive. The security secretary, Regina Ip, who was heavily criticised for her arrogant and condescending handling of the proposed law, was forced to resign.\n\nFor the first time in Hong Kong's history, on 1 July 2006, the People's Liberation Army marched through the city. The display was one of power and symbolism staged by 19 pro-Beijing groups. The march was part of a celebration demonstration that began in Victoria Park.\n\nMany calls were made for the resignation of Tung Chee-hwa, a leader who was blessed by the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin. Tung remained in the office until 10 March 2005, 20 months after the march against Article 23. Hong Kong's Basic Law permitted Tung to serve another 3 years, many suspected Beijing forced him to resign due to widespread public disapproval and his perceived lacklustre leadership. The 2005 election filled the seat with Donald Tsang who was the No. 2 ranking official, Chief Secretary, and career civil servant during British colonial rule.\n\nA survey conducted by the Hong Kong Journalists Association found that 58.4% of journalists think press freedom in HK has deteriorated since the handover, mainly as a result of self-censorship and government's tighter grip on information flow. Direct Internet censorship in Hong Kong has not been a major issue. In 2009 HK was still ranked 48 by the international Press Freedom Index. This is still far ahead of the People's Republic of China. Other self-censorship events include the 2009 Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority forum where major station TVB was labeled as CCTVB with censored news like the mainland's CCTV. The local Citizens' Radio was raided by the Office of the Telecommunications Authority (OFTA) after being deemed illegal.\n\nThe 1997 Asian Financial Crisis caused a deflationary period that spanned 6 years into July 2004. A few years later, the global Financial crisis of 2007–2010 rocked the financial well-being of the SAR's financial sector. The Lehman mini-bond crisis was one that affected the territory greatly. Joseph Yam, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority who was the highest paid central banker in the world resigned in 2009. Traditionally, HK dollar is pegged against the US dollar. Questions have come up on whether HK should peg to the Chinese yuan since it is integrated to China economically. But since the yuan is not fully convertible, a peg to the yuan would cause disruptions.\n\nAt the end of the 2000s, the International Commerce Centre (ICC), at 484 m (1,588 ft) high, was the tallest building in Hong Kong. The tallest building prior to the ICC was the Two International Finance Centre (2 IFC), at 415 m (1,362 ft) high, completed in 2003. Prior to that, the tallest building in Hong Kong was the Central Plaza since 1992, with a height of 374 m (1,227 ft).\n\nLots of new infrastructure projects had been completed throughout the territory during the 2000s. Examples of those infrastructures includes: For Railway - the completion of MTR Tseung Kwan O Line in 2002, KCR West Rail in 2003, KCR Ma On Shan Rail in 2004, MTR Disneyland Resort Line in 2005, the extension of the Airport Express to AsiaWorld-Expo in 2005, KCR Lok Ma Chau Spur Line in 2007, and MTR Kowloon Southern Link between East Rail Line and West Rail Line from Hung Hom Station to Nam Cheong Station via East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Austin Station in 2009. For major bridges and tunnels - the completion of Discovery Bay Tunnel in 2000, Nam Wan Tunnel in 2007, Deep Bay Bridge (Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor) in 2007, Eagle's Nest Tunnel and Sha Tin Heights Tunnel in 2008, and Stonecutters Bridge in 2009.\n\nOther major infrastructures includes the opening of the Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005, which was the fifth Disneyland opened in the world and the second opened in Asia after the Tokyo Disneyland, and the completion of the Ngong Ping 360 in 2006, which was a gondola lift system that connects Tung Chung New Town and Ngong Ping Market.\n\nIn 2000, the population of Hong Kong was 6,900,000. The population in the summer of 2006 was 6,994,500, though the majority of population increase is mostly contributed via immigration from mainland citizens. Also in 2006, the birth rate of 7.29 is ranked lowest among the list of countries surveyed by the CIA. Towards the end of the decade, Hong Kong's population had slowed further to a growth of 0.5% in 2009 with the city having a total population of 7,055,071 as of 2009. Other new immigration topics include the Right of abode issue, Quality Migrant Admission Scheme or the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme.\n\nThe passing of idol legends like Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui rocked the cantopop industry. Their deaths in the early 2000s further sank the people's morale. The 2008 Edison Chen photo scandal was also dubbed Asia's biggest scandal. Other cultural phenomenon include the rise of young female Liang mou models.\n\nThe HK government and entertainment industry pursued a number of major charities in the decade. The was held for the SARS outbreak. In early 2005, a major relief campaign concert was held for the victims of the neighbouring 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. This was followed by one of the largest assembly of celebrities in the territory in the Artistes 512 Fund Raising Campaign for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. In 2009 the Artistes 512 Fund Raising Campaign was held for Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan.\n\nHong Kong was the site for the 2008 Olympics and paralympics Equestrian events. The events were held at the Hong Kong Sports Institute in Fo Tan, Sha Tin. The torch relay also passed through both the Special administrative regions of HK and Macau. Various stars and celebrities were also present at the opening ceremonies in Beijing. At the end of 2009, HK also held its first ever East Asian Games. It opened up with a performance on the water of Victoria Harbour.\n\nBeginning in 2008, the Mong Kok acid attacks began a series of acid throwing incidents from tall buildings. The government also stepped up effort against many incidents of throwing any random objects out of skyscraper windows and roofs. The housing department began installing closed-circuit television systems to monitor these throwing activities. Other incident involve the creation of a mass-suicide Facebook group called \"I want to practise suicide\" (我要（練習）自殺). The group was shut down before urging 190 members to kill themselves.\n\nHealth officials made the Bird Flu crisis a top priority beginning in 1997. To control the spread of the virus, millions of chickens were slaughtered in an extreme measure to prevent the global spread of the H5N1 virus. The crisis would lead to a series of panic that continue well into the 2000s. The volume consumption of poultry was significantly reduced for a period. Beginning in 1997, over 1 million birds were slaughtered, followed by 860,000 in 2002. Another batch of 300,000 and 200,000 chickens in 5 farms in Kam Tin New Territories were also included in the quarantine process.\n\nChina also had series of outbreaks, and the pandemic have left both regions strained in trade relationships. Controversies of the handling of the crisis has been criticised by radio programmes, TVs and newspapers. Both Hong Kong and China were the center of international attention during the early 2000s. Specifically, the Health, Welfare and Food Bureau were constantly bombarded with questions about the effectiveness in the decision to slaughter in large numbers. Wild dogs, rats and cats preying on bags of uncollected dead poultry also made the whole procedure a public relations disaster for the government. In 2009 a Swine flu pandemics followed, but citizens were more prepared this time.\n\nThe first suspected case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was recorded in February, 2003. Hong Kong remained on the World Health Organization's list of affected areas until 23 June 2003. The city was gripped by fear of contagion and panic throughout the epidemic. Children stayed home, while schools were halted. Economic activities were greatly disrupted. Restaurants were empty, and tourism ground to a halt. The epidemic infected more than 1,700 people and claimed 299 lives. As director general of the World Health Organization, Margaret Chan faced some tough issues.\n\nThe World Trade Organization Conference of 2005 was held in Wan Chai. With 148 nations participating at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, it was one of the largest international event ever held in the area. A series of protests broke out in the designated protest zones and Hong Kong Police were resorted to using tear gas and pepper spray for crowd control. Numerous sources proclaimed the conference as the \"\"Siege of Wan Chai\"\" as the world class city became the hosting site of the event.\n"}

There are no objective biochemical or structural alterations of body organs or functions, and the disease is not recognized in other cultures. The term \"culture-bound syndrome\" was included in the fourth version of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) which also includes a list of the most common culture-bound conditions (DSM-IV: Appendix I). Counterpart within the framework of ICD-10 () are the \"culture-specific disorders\" defined in Annex 2 of the \"Diagnostic criteria for research\".\n\nMore broadly, an endemic that can be attributed to certain behavior patterns within a specific culture by suggestion may be referred to as a potential behavioral epidemic. As in the cases of drug use, or alcohol and smoking abuses, transmission can be determined by communal reinforcement and person-to-person interactions. On etiological grounds, it can be difficult to distinguish the causal contribution of culture upon disease from other environmental factors such as toxicity.\n\nA culture-specific syndrome is characterized by:\n\nSome culture-specific syndromes involve somatic symptoms (pain or disturbed function of a body part), while others are purely behavioral. Some culture-bound syndromes appear with similar features in several cultures, but with locally specific traits, such as penis panics.\n\nA culture-specific syndrome is not the same as a geographically localized disease with specific, identifiable, causal tissue abnormalities, such as kuru or sleeping sickness, or genetic conditions limited to certain populations. It is possible that a condition originally assumed to be a culture-bound behavioral syndrome is found to have a biological cause; from a medical perspective it would then be redefined into another nosological category.\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association states the following:\n\nThe term \"culture-bound syndrome\" denotes recurrent, locality-specific patterns of aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be \"illnesses,\" or at least afflictions, and most have local names. Although presentations conforming to the major DSM-IV categories can be found throughout the world, the particular symptoms, course, and social response are very often influenced by local cultural factors. In contrast, culture-bound syndromes are generally limited to specific societies or culture areas and are localized, folk, diagnostic categories that frame coherent meanings for certain repetitive, patterned, and troubling sets of experiences and observations.\n\nThe term \"culture-bound syndrome\" is controversial since it reflects the different opinions of anthropologists and psychiatrists. Anthropologists have a tendency to emphasize the relativistic and culture-specific dimensions of the syndromes, while physicians tend to emphasize the universal and neuropsychological dimensions. Guarnaccia & Rogler (1999) have argued in favor of investigating culture-bound syndromes on their own terms, and believe that the syndromes have enough cultural integrity to be treated as independent objects of research.\n\nSome studies suggest that culture-bound syndromes represent an acceptable way within a specific culture (and cultural context) among certain vulnerable individuals (i.e. an \"ataque de nervios\" at a funeral in Puerto Rico) to express distress in the wake of a traumatic experience. A similar manifestation of distress when displaced into a North American medical culture may lead to a very different, even adverse outcome for a given individual and his or her family.\n\nThe fourth edition of \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" classifies the below syndromes as culture-bound syndromes:\nThe fifth edition of \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" classifies the below syndromes as cultural concepts of distress, a closely related concept:\n\nThe 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) classifies the below syndromes as culture-specific disorders:\nThough \"the ethnocentric bias of Euro-American psychiatrists has led to the idea that culture-bound syndromes are confined to non-Western cultures,\" a prominent example of a Western culture-bound syndrome is anorexia nervosa.\n\nWithin the contiguous United States, the consumption of kaolin, a type of clay, has been proposed as a culture-bound syndrome observed in African Americans in the rural south, particularly in areas in which the mining of kaolin is common. In South Africa, among the Xhosa people, the syndrome of amafufunyana is commonly used to describe those believed to be possessed by demons or other malevolent spirits. Traditional healers in the culture usually perform exorcisms in order to drive off these spirits. Upon investigating the phenomenon, researchers found that many of the people claimed to be affected by the syndrome exhibited the traits and characteristics of schizophrenia.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that both premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and the more severe premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which have currently unknown physical mechanisms, are Western culture-bound syndromes. However, this is controversial.\n\nVegetative-vascular dystonia can be considered an example of somatic condition formally recognised by local medical community in former Soviet Union countries, but not in Western classification systems. Its umbrella term nature as neurological condition also results in diagnosing neurotic patients as neurological ones, in effect substituting possible psychiatric stigma with culture-bound syndrome disguised as a neurological condition.\n\nRefugee children in Sweden have been known to fall into coma-like states on learning their families will be deported. The condition, known in Swedish as \"uppgivenhetssyndrom\", or resignation syndrome, is believed to only exist among the refugee population in the Scandinavian country, where it has been prevalent since the early part of the 21st century. In a 130-page report on the condition commissioned by the government and published in 2006, a team of psychologists, political scientists, and sociologists hypothesized that it was a culture-bound syndrome.\n\nA startle disorder similar to latah, called \"imu\" (sometimes spelled \"imu:\"), is found among Ainu people, both Sakhalin Ainu and Hokkaido Ainu.\n\nA condition similar to piblokto, called (sometimes \"meryachenie\"), is found among Yakuts, Yukaghirs, and Evenks living in Siberia.\n\n\n"}

He was himself well-educated. Little of his personal history is known beyond the fact that he moved to Nuremberg in 1560, where he took on citizenship and continued to reside until his death in March 1591. He worked initially with Virgil Solis, then a leading producer of book illustrations. His productivity was very remarkable, as may be gathered from the statement of one of his pupils, who said that the drawings he made during a period of four years would have filled a hay wagon. A large number of his original drawings are in the Berlin print room. About 1,500 prints are attributed to him. He was one of the last major producers of woodcuts for books, as during his career engravings were gradually taking over that role. Although like most woodcut artists, he normally let a specialist \"formschneider\" cut the block to his drawing, he occasionally included both a cutter's knife and a quill pen in his signature on prints, suggesting he sometimes cut his own blocks.\n\nA series of engravings by Amman of the kings of France, with short biographies, appeared in Frankfurt in 1576. He also executed many of the woodcut illustrations for the Bible published at Frankfurt by Sigismund Feierabend, and for a topographical survey of Bavaria by Philipp Apian. Another serial work, the \"Panoplia Omnium Liberalium Mechanicarum et Seden-tariarum Artium Genera Continens\", containing 115 plates, is of great value.

{"id": "2305186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305186", "title": "Earnout", "text": "Earnout\n\nEarnout or earn-out refers to a pricing structure in mergers and acquisitions where the sellers must \"earn\" part of the purchase price based on the performance of the business following the acquisition.\n\nEarnouts are often employed when the buyer(s) and seller(s) disagree about the expected growth and future performance of the target company. A typical earnout takes place over a three to five-year period after closing of the acquisition and may involve anywhere from ten to fifty percent of the purchase price being deferred over that period. Earnouts are popular among private equity investors, who do not necessarily have the expertise to run a target business after closing, as a way of keeping the previous owners involved following the acquisition. \n\nThe terms and conditions of an earnout are largely dependent on which party will actually manage the business following the closing. If the buyer will manage the business, the seller may be concerned with mismanagement by the buyer which causes the company to miss targets. On the other hand, if the seller will manage the business, the buyer may be concerned with the seller either minimizing or understating expenses or overstating revenue so as to manipulate the earnout calculation. \n\nThe financial targets used in an earnout calculation may include revenue, net income, EBITDA or EBIT targets, and the selection of metrics also influences the terms and conditions of the earnout. Sellers tend to prefer revenue as the simplest measurement, but revenue can be boosted through business activities that hurt the bottom line of the company. On the other hand, while buyers tend to prefer net income as the most accurate reflection of overall economic performance, this number can be manipulated downward through extensive capital expenditures and other front-loaded business expenses. Some earnouts may be based on entirely non-financial targets such as the development of a product or the execution of a contract. Other performance metrics may include sales (gross or net), gross profit, operating income (EBIT), operating cash flow (EBITDA), environmental costs, cost savings from synergies, reduction of debt or derivatives of any of these.\n\nEarnouts have several fundamental limitations. They generally work best when the business is operated as envisioned at the time of the transaction, and are not conducive to changing the business plan in response to future issues. In some transactions, the buyer may have the ability to block the earnout targets from being met. Outside factors may also impact the company's ability to achieve earnout targets. Because of these limitations, sellers often negotiate earnout terms very carefully.\n"}

Desportes, who was richly beneficed and in great favor at court, seems to have been regarded as Mathurin Régnier's natural protector and patron; and the boy himself, with a view to his following in his uncle's steps, was tonsured at eight years old.\n\nLittle is known of his youth, and it is chiefly conjecture which fixes the date of his visit to Italy in a humble position in the suite of the cardinal, François de Joyeuse, in 1587. The cardinal was accredited to the papal court in that year as protector of the royal interests. Regnier found his duties irksome, and when, after many years of constant travel in the cardinals service, he returned definitely to France about 1605, he took advantage of the hospitality of Desportes.\n\nHe early began the practice of satirical writing, and the enmity which existed between his uncle and the poet François de Malherbe gave him occasion to attack the latter. In 1606 Desportes died, leaving nothing to Régnier, who, though disappointed of the succession to Desportes's abbacies, obtained a pension of 2000 livres, chargeable upon one of them. He was also made in 1609 canon of Chartres through his friendship with the lax bishop, Philippe Hurault, at whose abbey of Royaumont he spent much time in the later years of his life. But the death of Henri IV. deprived him of his last hope of great preferments. His later life had been one of dissipation, and he died at Rouen at his hotel, the \"Ecu d'Orlans\", in October 1613.\n\nAbout the time of his death numerous collections of licentious and satirical poems were published, while others remained in manuscript. Gathered from these there has been a floating mass of licentious epigrams, etc., attributed to Régnier, little of which is certainly authentic, so that it is very rare to find two editions of Régnier which exactly agree in contents. His undoubted work falls into three classes: regular satires in alexandrine couplets, serious poems in various metres, and satirical or jocular epigrams and light pieces, which often, if not always, exhibit considerable licence of language.\n\nThe real greatness of Régnier consists in the vigour and polish of his satires, contrasted and heightened as that vigour is with the exquisite feeling and melancholy music of some of his minor poems. In these Régnier is a disciple of Pierre Ronsard (whom he defended brilliantly against Malherbe), without the occasional pedantry, the affectation or the undue fluency of the La Pléiade; but in the satires he seems to have had no master except the ancients, for some of them were written before the publication of the satires of Vauquelin de la Fresnaye, and the \"Tragiques\" of Agrippa d'Aubigné did not appear until 1616. He has sometimes followed Horace closely, but always in an entirely original spirit. His vocabulary is varied and picturesque, and is not marred by the maladroit classicism of some of the Ronsardists.\n\nHis verse is extraordinarily forcible and virgorous, but his chief distinction as a satirist is the way in which he avoids the commonplaces of satire. His keen and accurate knowledge of human nature and even his purely literary qualities extorted the admiration of Boileau. Régnier displayed remarkable independence and acuteness in literary criticism, and the famous passage (Satire ix., A Monsieur Rapin) in which he satirizes Malherbe contains the best denunciation of the merely correct theory of poetry that has ever been written. Lastly, Regnier had a most unusual descriptive faculty, and the vividness of what he called his narrative satires was not approached in France for at least two centuries after his death. All his merits are displayed in the masterpiece entitled \"Macette ou l'Hypocrisie dconcerte\", which does not suffer even on comparison with Tartuffe; but hardly any one of the sixteen satires which he has left falls below a very high standard.\n\n\"Les Premieres d'Euvres ou satyres de Regnier\" (Paris, 1608) included the \"Discours au rol\" and ten satires. There was another in 1609, and others in 1612 and 1613. The author had also contributed to two collections : \"Les Muses gaillardes\" in 1609 and \"Le Temple d'Apollon\" in 1611. In 1616 appeared \"Les Satyres et autres cvuvres folastres du sieur Régnier\", with many additions and some poems by other hands. Two famous editions by Elzevir (Leiden, 1642 and 1652) are highly prized. The chief editions of the 18th century are that of Claude Brossette (printed by Lyon & Woodman, London, 1729), which supplies the standard commentary on Régnier, and that of Lenglet Dufresnoy (printed by J. Tonson, London, 1733). The editions of Prosper Poitevin (Paris, 1860), of Ed. de Barthlemy (Paris, 1862), and of E. Courbet (Paris, 1875), may be specially mentioned. The last, printed after the originals in italic type, and well edited, is perhaps the best. See also Vianey's \"Mathurin Régnier\" (1896); M. H. Cherrier, \"Bibliographie de Mathurin Régnier\" (1884).\n\n"}

{"id": "2305205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305205", "title": "Massachusetts Maritime Academy", "text": "Massachusetts Maritime Academy\n\nMassachusetts Maritime Academy (Maritime, Mass Maritime, MMA or Mass when differentiating between the other Maritime Academies) is a public college in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, focused on maritime-related fields. Established in 1891, Mass Maritime is the second oldest state maritime academy in the United States. Originally established to graduate deck and engineering officers for the U.S. Merchant Marine, the academy has since expanded its curriculum. Though not required, some graduates go on to serve in active and reserve components of the U.S. Armed Forces. The academy operates a training ship, the USTS \"Kennedy\".\n\nMassachusetts Maritime Academy was founded by an act of the state legislature on June 11, 1891 as the Massachusetts Nautical Training School; the name was changed in 1913 to the Massachusetts Nautical School and it took its present name in 1942. The school's first training ship was the USS \"Enterprise\" on loan from the Navy.\n\nThe school was located at a pier in Boston until 1936. It then was moved to Hyannis, MA on Cape Cod, where it remained until after World War II. In 1946, the Academy acquired land at the State Pier on Taylors Point in Buzzards Bay, MA at the southern end of the Cape Cod Canal with a berth deep enough to accommodate the USS Charleston, the school's new training ship. A classroom building was built, but life and education at the school continued to revolve around its training ships for the next 25 years.\n\nIn 1972, the state legislature appropriated money to build brick dormitories, a cadet mess hall, the library, a second classroom building that also encompassed the school's administrative offices, a football and baseball diamond, and a gymnasium. At that time, the structure of the Corps of Cadets shifted from ship-based watches and divisions to a platoon, company and battalion system similar to that of the Naval Academy better suited to the new dormitories.\n\nWomen were first admitted to the academy in 1978, with the Class of 1981. At that time, the existing battalion structure was expanded to become a two-battalion regiment as two additional company dormitories were completed. The most recently completed building was for the school's radar simulator trainer.\n\nOne unique off-campus program run by the Academy is the scale model ship-handling program (similar to the supertanker training school in France) that is run on a pond ten miles from the campus. It is the only program of its kind in the United States. Many types of 'ships' and several scale model 'ports' are set up on the pond. The quality of the training ship's officers receive from this program is such that the U.S. Coast Guard will remit a quarter of the sea time required to upgrade a deck officer's license from Chief Mate to Master upon successful completion of the course.\n\nMass. Maritime's traditional Marine Transportation or Marine Engineering majors were expanded to include many additional maritime-related majors in 1990 (see Academic Programs, below) in time for the school's centennial celebration. At the same time, for the first time the Academy began offering master's degree programs in various disciplines.\n\nIn 2008, the Academy acquired a Vestas 660-kilowatt wind turbine and began installation of solar power screens on top of the dormitories. As the windspeed across the campus averages 12 to 15 knots year round, the location is ideal for wind power. At present, 30% of the Academy's power needs are supplied by the wind turbine and solar power. The current administration hopes to eventually make Massachusetts Maritime Academy's campus self-sufficient in regard to electric power. As it is, the Academy is the 'greenest' of the twelve colleges in the state college system and one of the greenest colleges in the country.\n\nAll residential students are members of the Academy's Regiment of Cadets. Within the Regiment, cadets supervise other cadets in a broad variety of activities, including the orientation of freshmen, room inspections, Morning Formation, daily cleaning stations, study hours, sea term planning and shipboard responsibilities. Students who seek to enroll in the Facilities Engineering or the Emergency Management programs as non-uniformed commuter students must apply in writing for admission to that status.\n\nAcademy freshmen, called \"Youngies\" (short for \"young ladies and gentlemen\"), arrive at the Academy in mid-August for Orientation, a two-week military-style indoctrination program that is physically and mentally demanding. It encompasses regimental training, military drill, and physical fitness. It also serves as an introduction to shipboard/maritime safety, nomenclature, and customs. The indoctrination period and cadet candidate program is essential to the preparation for the youngies' first semester at sea (sea term) in January.\n\nAfter Orientation, the academic year begins. For the rest of their first academic year as fourth class cadets, Youngies continue to be required to adhere to stringent rules affecting many aspects of their daily life.\n\nSecond class cadets (juniors) are designated Squad Leaders and are in charge of the training of the Youngies. First class cadets (seniors) hold cadet officer positions within the regiment and/or aboard the training ship.\n\nComposed of 60 officers, the MMA Band and Chorus is the premier musical ensemble of the academy and the official music department of the MMA. It takes part in all ceremonial events at MMA as well as changes of command, military retirements and funerals at Massachusetts National Cemetery. The band also provides music for community events around the New England, region.\n\nThe band consists of the following ensembles:\n\n\nMMA Band Staff:\n\n\nThe Alpha Platoon is the regiment's exhibition drill unit whose members are selected after a semester of mastering drill and ceremony.\n\nThe honour guard is primarily a ceremonial colour guard consisting of at least 6 cadets. They are responsible for the posting of the colours during athletic events. It also maintains a sabre team for other events at the MMA.\n\nPrior to the expansion of its offered majors in 1990, the academy was exclusively a merchant marine college, tasked with the training of future cargo ship officers. The academy only offered majors in the ship transport subjects of Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering. The academy now offers many more majors focused on maritime subjects including graduate degrees.\n\nSea terms are conducted between the two academic semesters, in January and February. Cadets register soon after the New Year holiday and prepare the USTS \"Kennedy\" for sailing, including loading provisions in the freezers and dry stores spaces. The ship sails for foreign ports of the Caribbean Sea three out of four years, and one in four formerly traveled to the Mediterranean Sea. At least one of the Caribbean voyages includes the Panama Canal and an Equator crossing.\n\nThe voyage lasts about 52 days on average, and during that time a cadet will rotate through class and laboratory training at sea, ships operations including deck and engine watches, maintenance and emergency drills. Port visits offer a time to relax, but still include watch responsibilities and ship's maintenance.\n\n\nThe academy offers an exchange program to Shanghai Maritime Academy, an 18,000-student school situated next to a deep-water port. Cadets spend 100 days in the Shanghai program taking maritime business, law, and marketing classes and exploring the country to gain the experience they will need in the international maritime field. Four months later, Chinese cadets make the trek to Taylor's Point and spend a semester at Massachusetts Maritime Academy. They are immersed into American culture, featuring trips to Boston, New York, Washington DC, and Plymouth Plantation.\n\nMassachusetts Maritime Academy has done a great deal of work to incorporate green and safe energy to the campus. The campus green energy initiative consists of solar panels on top of the dormitories that provide 81 kilowatts of solar power to the campus. The Academy also owns a 660 kilowatt wind turbine that provides nearly 20 percent of the campus's electricity.\n\nCombined heat and power has been installed in the dormitories. Micro-turbines (small scale combustion turbines) generate electricity for the campus while utilizing the waste heat and flue exhaust to heat the hot water used in the dormitories.\n\nThe American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Information Commons is a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum Building. The 42,000 square foot building opened in September 2011 and was a 23 million dollar project. The construction of the building used 100% recycled steel; 20% recycled concrete; and 40% recycled insulation. The wood in the building is\nall bamboo as well. The building is cooled and heated by a geothermal system along with chilled beam technology. Additional light sensors and natural light are provided with skylights reducing the need for artificial lighting when enough natural light is present. The building is furnished with water conserving fixtures and the landscaping uses no irrigation for the planted areas. Water captured from the roof irrigates plantings adjacent to the building. In addition, the pitch of the roof of the ABS Information Commons increases the airflow directed towards the wind turbine by 8%.\n\nSports teams for Massachusetts Maritime Academy compete as the Buccaneers and <nowiki> </nowiki>currently include baseball, men's and women's crew, men's and women's cross country, football, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's sailing, men's and women's soccer, softball, men's and women's track & field, and volleyball. These teams compete in the Massachusetts State College Athletic Conference, Eastern College Athletic Conference, New England Football Conference, Pilgrim Lacrosse League, Mid-Atlantic Rifle Conference, Intercollegiate Sailing Association and the New England Women's Lacrosse Alliance.\n\n\n \n"}

Many of the battles in the final stages of this conflict took place in and around the Barranco de Fataga.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Fataga had some 650 inhabitants, dedicated to the farming of cereals, vegetables and fruits, as well as cattle. At that time it was a self-sufficient farming community, owing its prosperity to the water source known as \"El Cercado de Fataga\" (The Orchard of Fataga) or \"Fuente Grande\" (Great Spring).\n\nFataga is a very popular day-trip destination for holidaymakers staying in the coastal regions of Gran Canaria.\nIt is a characteristic village of the island, with its old narrow lanes paved with stones and famous historic Canarian houses. It is a candidate for a listing as World Heritage Site. The village is in Fataga ravine (\"barranco de Fataga\"), an environment of brown rocks strewn with green known as the \"valley of the thousand palms\".\n\nThe church, dedicated to St. José, was built in 1880. In the period up to the present day new farms and houses were built, often growing fruits such as oranges, lemons, apricots and grapes. However the population of the village has now dropped to around 265.\n\nFataga has three restaurants, tourist areas, one of the oldest bakeries on the island and a watermill. Little artisan shops can be found near the church as much as near the bakery. Lastly but not least, the Arteara necropolis is halfway up from Maspalomas in Arteara.\n"}

To find employment, he moved south to Cheshire in England as a gardener. In 1814, whilst employed at West Hall, High Legh in Cheshire he experienced difficulties with his employer due to his Methodist sympathies. For a short period, after having applied successfully to the London Missionary Society (LMS) to become an overseas missionary, he took an interim post as a farmer, at Plantation Farm in Dukinfield (where he first met Mary his future wife). The job had been found for him by William Roby, who took Moffat under his wing for a year.\n\nIn September 1816, Moffat was formally commissioned at Surrey Chapel in London as a missionary of LMS (on the same day as John Williams) and was sent out to South Africa. His fiancée Mary Smith (1795–1870) was able to join him three years later, after he returned to Cape Town from Namaqualand.\n\nIn 1820 Moffat and his wife left the Cape and proceeded to Griquatown, where their daughter Mary (who was later to marry David Livingstone) was born. The family later settled at Kuruman, to the north of the Vaal River, among the Batswana people. Here they lived and worked passionately for the missionary cause, enduring many hardships. Once he went for days without water and his mouth became so dry he was unable to speak. Often he bound his stomach to help him endure fasting when he could not find food to eat. During this period, Robert Moffat made frequent journeys into the neighbouring regions as far north as the Matabele country. He communicated the results of these journeys to the Royal Geographical Society (\"Journal 25-38\" and \"Proceedings ii\"). Whilst in Britain on leave (1839–43) an account of the family's experience, \"Missionary Labours and Scenes in South Africa\" (1842) was published. He translated the whole of the Bible and \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" into Setswana. Besides his early training as a gardener and farmer, and later as a writer, Moffat developed skills in building, carpentry, printing and as a blacksmith.\n\nRobert and Mary Moffat had ten children: Mary (who married David Livingstone), Ann, Robert (who died as an infant), Robert (who died at the age of 36, leaving an uncompleted, but published, work on the Setswana language), Helen, Elizabeth (who also died as an infant), James, John, Elizabeth and Jean. Their son John Smith Moffat became an LMS missionary and took over the running of the mission at Kuruman before entering colonial service. Their grandson Howard Unwin Moffat became a prime minister of Southern Rhodesia. Mary preceded Robert in death in 1870, at home in England where they had returned because of failing health. For the last twelve years of his life, Robert spoke throughout England, seeking to raise interest in the mission work. He was presented to Queen Victoria twice at her request and was presented with a Doctor of Divinity degree from Edinburgh University.\n\nRobert Moffat died at Leigh, near Tunbridge Wells, on 9 August 1883, and is buried at West Norwood Cemetery. A memorial monument, paid for by public subscription, was erected at his birthplace in 1885.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2305246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305246", "title": "Vicente del Bosque", "text": "Vicente del Bosque\n\nVicente del Bosque González, 1st Marquess of Del Bosque (; born 23 December 1950) is a Spanish football coach and former player who most recently managed the Spain national team. After taking over from Luis Aragonés – who had led Spain to European success at UEFA Euro 2008 – Del Bosque went on to lead the national team to win their first-ever FIFA World Cup in 2010, and then to retain their European Championship in 2012. Del Bosque coached Real Madrid from 1999 to 2003, which was one of the most successful periods in the club's modern era. Del Bosque is regarded as one of the greatest and most successful managers of all time; he is to date the only football manager to have won the Champions League, the European Championship, and the World Cup, as well as the Intercontinental Cup.\n\nDuring his playing career, del Bosque made over 400 appearances for Real Madrid, winning five La Liga titles and four Copas del Rey. He played internationally with the senior Spain national team on 18 occasions.\n\nAs a player, del Bosque was a midfielder who played in La Liga 441 times with 30 goals. This career included spells at Castilla CF, Córdoba, Castellón and Real Madrid. He won five league titles (1974–75, 1975–76, 1977–78, 1978–79, 1979–80) and four Copa del Rey titles (1973–74, 1974–75, 1979–80, 1981–82) with Real Madrid. He was also part of the Real Madrid team that lost to Liverpool in the 1981 European Cup Final.\n\nInternationally, del Bosque received 18 caps with the Spain national team, scoring one goal. He appeared for Spain at UEFA Euro 1980, which would be a disappointing for Spain exiting at the group stage of the competition.\n\nDel Bosque served at Real Madrid since 1994 and rose through the ranks at the club; however, he only first managed Madrid for a couple of months in 1994 after the sacking of Benito Floro and before the appointment of Jorge Valdano. He would again manage Real for two games in 1996, while he was the youth team coach, after Jorge Valdano was sacked and before Arsenio Iglesias took the job until the end of that season. But in 1999–2000, the club management decided to give him the full-time job after difficulties with their coach, John Toshack, with del Bosque taking over in November 1999.\n\nIn his four seasons in charge, del Bosque ushered the club through its most successful spell in modern history, having steered the club to two UEFA Champions League titles in 2000 and 2002, two domestic La Liga titles in 2001 and 2003, a Supercopa de España in 2001, a UEFA Super Cup in 2002, the Intercontinental Cup in 2002 as well as finishing in the last four of the UEFA Champions League every year he was in charge. Not since the great Madrid side of the 1950s and 1960s that had Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás did the club succeed so consistently. Del Bosque was credited with a humble, patient and unassuming style which saw him manage the club as it underwent a policy during Florentino Pérez's tenure as club President that was known as \"Los Galácticos\", where the world's best and most marketable stars were signed for the club beginning with Luís Figo and including David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo. In the del Bosque era Real managed 104 wins out of a possible 186 in his time as coach of Madrid. Despite the level of success, many players – in particular the so-called \"Galácticos\" – were bought without the input of del Bosque amid often made allegations that the Real Madrid hierarchy (in particular Pérez and general manager Jorge Valdano) had more control over transfer policy, team selection and other aspects of club that minimised the level of control del Bosque had during his time as manager.\n\nReal Madrid decided not to renew Del Bosque's contract in 2003, just a day after he won the club its 29th Liga title and a week after the club signed David Beckham. Del Bosque was offered the post of technical director but turned it down, leading to many suggestions in the Spanish media that there was indeed a much rumoured political split at the club involving del Bosque and several players, especially captain Fernando Hierro (who was asked to leave the club in the summer of 2003), on one side, while Valdano and Pérez wielded the axe of control to in their words, \"shake up the team,\" on the other. Pérez said in an interview with BBC Sport, \"del Bosque was showing signs of exhaustion. I want to be sincere about this – our belief that he was not the right coach for the future.\"\n\nThe BBC article states: \"It is a strange tale from start to finish – how the shy, mustachioed man from Salamanca came to be in charge of the most expensive and talented bunch of footballers in the modern game, won the biggest trophies on offer and then got the boot in favour of a man yet to be named. With the Real superstars, del Bosque was extremely popular – partly because he was happier to let them get on with it. Cool as a cryogenically-frozen cucumber, he managed to avoid confrontations with his charges, despite the stellar egos in the squad, and never once lost his calm in front of the media.\"\n\nSince Del Bosque's departure, Real Madrid changed seven coaches in the four-year period since his departure and did not win any major trophies until they won the La Liga title in 2007, under new coach Fabio Capello (who was also sacked afterwards). They had also been defeated in the Round of 16 in the Champions League every year since the 2004–05 season (one year after Del Bosque was sacked), until the 2010–11 Champions League season, which saw Real Madrid defeat Lyon in the Round of 16 under new manager José Mourinho. It would take until Real Madrid had manager Carlo Ancelotti, during the 2013–14 campaign, before the club won another Champions League title.\n\nAfter Iñaki Sáez resigned in the wake of a terrible performance at UEFA Euro 2004, which saw Spain having their worst result in the tournament since 1988, del Bosque was approached as a possible manager of the national side. He was not interested in the job, however, and the job was subsequently given to Luis Aragonés.\n\nWith Beşiktaş, del Bosque arrived in Turkey to much fanfare and hope, but failure to deliver results saw him get the sack towards the tail end of the 2004–05 season.\n\nAfter Mexico were eliminated by Argentina in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, del Bosque was approached with an offer to become their manager, but declined.\n\nDuring the 2007 Real Madrid crisis, del Bosque spoke on the line saying that the departure of Ronaldo was a mistake, and he was one of the candidates to replace Fabio Capello as manager of the team. Bernd Schuster, however, was awarded the job on 9 July 2007.\n\nOn 11 March 2008, del Bosque announced that he would replace Luis Aragonés as the coach of the Spain national team; it was confirmed on 15 July 2008.\n\nSpain under del Bosque began their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign successfully, defeating Bosnia and Herzegovina 1–0 with a goal from David Villa. Spain defeated Armenia 4–0 three days later with two goals coming from Villa, and one each from Joan Capdevila and Marcos Senna, with a notable debut from Bojan, coming on as a substitute and defeating rumours that he will swap allegiances to Serbia. This win secured the Spaniards a first place spot in their group with six points. The next round saw Spain defeat Estonia 3–0, then, four days later, beat Belgium 2–1 away — an 88th-minute strike from Villa (his fifth of the campaign) earning them the win. This result maintained their 100% start to the qualifying campaign.\n\nSince del Bosque was appointed to the job, 38 players have debuted with the Spain team: Bojan, Andoni Iraola, Fernando Llorente, Diego Capel, Sergio Busquets, Jesús Navas, Diego López, Gerard Piqué, Jordi Alba, Pedro, Pablo Hernández, Borja Valero, Bruno, Nacho Monreal, Víctor Valdés, Álvaro Negredo, Juan Mata, Javi Martínez, Thiago, Manu, Aritz Aduriz, Adrián, Juanfran, Beñat, Iker Muniain, Javi García, Álvaro Domínguez, Markel Susaeta, Koke, Marc Bartra, Isco, César Azpilicueta, Iñigo Martínez, Alberto Moreno, Mario Suárez, Michu, Cristian Tello, Diego Costa, Ander Iturraspe, David de Gea and Gerard Deulofeu, while one uncapped player, Fernando Amorebieta, has been called up but failed to debut.\n\nOn 9 June 2009, in a friendly against Azerbaijan in which Spain won 6–0, del Bosque became the first manager in all of football history to win his first ten games as debut manager of a national team, the previous record being nine held by João Saldanha of Brazil. The record currently stands at 13 successive victories, with the last winning match being a 2–0 win against South Africa in the 2009 Confederations Cup, followed by a 2–0 defeat in the semifinal stage of the same competition against United States.\n\nOn 14 October 2009, Spain joined the very small number of teams to have won all their World Cup qualifying games in a single campaign, achieving a record-breaking ten wins in ten games.\n\nIn Spain's first game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup on 16 June, they lost 0–1 to Switzerland. Spain bounced back and won group H by winning the next two games. They faced Portugal in the Round of 16, winning 1–0, and defeated Paraguay in their quarter-final match, again by 1–0. Spain then defeated Germany in the semi-final on 7 July 2010, winning 1–0, allowing them to reach their first ever World Cup final. In the final against the Netherlands, he led his team to victory after a goal scored in extra time by Andrés Iniesta. Upon this triumph, he became the oldest coach to win the World Cup.\n\nOn 1 July 2012, del Bosque led Spain to victory at Euro 2012, hosted by Poland and Ukraine. Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the final in Kiev to win a second consecutive European championship.\n\nIn the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup held in Brazil, Spain advanced to the final, played against Brazil; but suffered a heavy 3–0 defeat. A goal from Neymar and a brace from Fred saw a heavy burden landing on del Bosque and his type of football tactics he used, tiki-taka.\n\nIn the 2014 FIFA World Cup, del Bosque and his team posted their worst finish in the finals since the World Cup in France in 1998 through being eliminated during the group stage following a 5–1 defeat to the Netherlands and a 2–0 defeat to Chile, despite a 3–0 win over Australia. The heavy opening defeat to the Netherlands marked the first time Spain had conceded 5 or more goals in an international game since a 6–2 defeat to Scotland in 1963, and only the second time they had conceded 5 or more goals in a World Cup game, having done so before in their 6–1 defeat to Brazil in 1950, which incidentally was also held in Brazil. The result was also the biggest margin of defeat by a defending champion at a World Cup. Furthermore, despite a 3–0 win rounding of their campaign following the 2–0 defeat to Chile, Spain's final standing of 23rd out of the 32 entered teams was their worst-ever finish at a World Cup. After this, he announced that he would resign as Spain's manager, but there was no reaction from the RSFF.\n\nDel Bosque announced his intentions to resign as the Spain national team coach following UEFA Euro 2016. On 14 June 2015, he reached 100 matches as Spain coach in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying win over Belarus in Barysaw.\n\nAt the age of 65 and having achieved every available top-tier title, del Bosque announced his retirement from the sport on 30 June 2016.\nDel Bosque is married to María de la Santísima Trinidad \"Trini\" López, and has three children — two sons and one daughter.\n\n\nReal Madrid\n\nSpain\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2305249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305249", "title": "Mahamadou Issoufou", "text": "Mahamadou Issoufou\n\nMahamadou Issoufou (born January 1, 1951) is a Nigerien politician who has been the President of Niger since 7 April 2011. Issoufou was the Prime Minister of Niger from 1993 to 1994, President of the National Assembly from 1995 to 1996, and he has been a candidate in each presidential election since 1993. He led the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS-Tarayya), a social democratic party, from its foundation in 1990 until his election as President of Niger in 2011. During the Presidency of Mamadou Tandja (1999–2010), Issoufou was the main opposition leader.\n\nIssoufou, an ethnic Hausa, was born in the town of Dandaji in Tahoua Department. An engineer by trade (Ingénieur Civil des Mines de St Etienne), he served as National Director of Mines from 1980 to 1985 before becoming Secretary-General of the Mining Company of Niger (SOMAIR). He is married to Aïssata Issoufou Mahamadou, a chemist, and to second wife, Dr. Malika Issoufou Mahamadou, a physician.\n\nIn February 1993, the country's first multiparty legislative and presidential elections were held. In the parliamentary election, Issoufou's party, the PNDS, won 13 seats in the National Assembly, and Issoufou himself won a seat as a PNDS candidate in Tahoua constituency.\n\nTogether with other opposition parties, the PNDS then joined a coalition, the Alliance of the Forces of Change (AFC). This coalition held the majority of the newly elected seats in the National Assembly. Later in February 1993, Issoufou ran as the PNDS candidate in the presidential election. He placed third, winning 15.92 percent of the vote. The AFC then supported second-place finisher Mahamane Ousmane for president in the second round of the election, held on 27 March. Ousmane won the election, defeating Tandja Mamadou, the candidate of the National Movement of the Development Society (MNSD); with the AFC holding a parliamentary majority, Issoufou became Prime Minister on 17 April 1993.\n\nOn 28 September 1994, Issoufou resigned in response to a decree from Ousmane a week earlier that weakened the powers of the prime minister, and the PNDS withdrew from the governing coalition. As a result, the coalition lost its parliamentary majority and Ousmane called a new parliamentary election to be held in January 1995.\n\nIssoufou and the PNDS forged an alliance with their old opponents, the MNSD, and in the January 1995 election that alliance won a slight majority of seats; Issoufou was then elected as President of the National Assembly. The opposition's victory in the election led to cohabitation between President Ousmane and a government, backed by a parliamentary majority, that opposed him; the result was political deadlock. With the dispute between President Ousmane and the government deepening, on 26 January 1996 Issoufou requested that the Supreme Court remove Ousmane from office for alleged incapacity to govern. A day later, on 27 January 1996, Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara seized power in a military coup. Issoufou, along with President Ousmane and Prime Minister Hama Amadou, was arrested and subsequently placed under house arrest until April 1996. They were all put on television by the military regime in February 1996 to endorse the official view that the coup was caused by flaws in the political system and that changes in the system were needed.\n\nIssoufou placed fourth (receiving only 7.60% of the vote) in the flawed and controversial 7–8 July 1996 presidential election that gave Maïnassara an outright victory. Along with the three other opposition candidates, Issoufou was placed under house arrest on the second day of polling and held for two weeks. Afterward, he refused to meet with Maïnassara, unsuccessfully appealed to the Supreme Court for the election to be annulled, and the PNDS called for demonstrations. On 26 July he was again placed under house arrest, along with another leading PNDS member, Mohamed Bazoum; they were freed on the order of a judge on 12 August. Following a pro-democracy demonstration on 11 January 1997, Issoufou was arrested along with Ousmane and Tandja and held until 23 January.\n\nMaïnassara was killed in another military coup in April 1999, and new elections were held in late in the year. In the first round of the presidential election, held in October, Issoufou placed second, winning 22.79% of the vote. He was later defeated by Tandja Mamadou in the November run-off, capturing 40.11% of the vote compared to Tandja's 59.89%. He was backed in the second round by the unsuccessful first round candidates Hamid Algabid, Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye, and Ali Djibo, while Tandja received Ousmane's support. After the announcement of the provisional results showing Tandja's victory, Issoufou accepted them and congratulated Tandja.\n\nIn the November 1999 parliamentary election, Issoufou was again elected to the National Assembly as a PNDS candidate in Tahoua constituency.\n\nIn a repeat of the 1999 election, Issoufou placed second behind incumbent Tandja in the 2004 presidential election, winning 24.60% of the vote. He was defeated in the run-off, winning 34.47% of the vote to Tandja's 65.53%; however, that was still considered an impressive result for Issoufou, as he had substantially increased his share of the vote even though the other first round candidates had backed Tandja in the second round. Issoufou, who targeted corruption in his campaign, accused Tandja of using state funds for his own campaign, along with other accusations of electoral misconduct, and said that the election was not as transparent as the 1999 election.\n\nIn the December 2004 parliamentary election, Issoufou was re-elected to the National Assembly as a PNDS candidate in Tahoua constituency.\n\nIn 2009, the PNDS strongly opposed Tandja's efforts to hold a referendum on the creation of a new constitution that would allow him to run for re-election indefinitely. At an opposition rally in Niamey on 9 May 2009, Issoufou accused Tandja of seeking \"a new constitution to stay in power forever\" and the establishment of \"a dictatorship and a monarchy\". As leader of the Front for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) opposition coalition, he said on 4 June 2009 that a planned anti-referendum protest would be held on 7 June despite an official ban.\n\nAs part of the constitutional dispute, Tandja assumed emergency powers on 27 June. Accusing Tandja of undertaking a \"coup d'état\", \"violating the constitution and ... forfeit[ing] all political and moral legitimacy\", Issoufou called on the armed forces to ignore his orders and urged the international community to intervene. Issoufou was detained at his home by the army's paramilitary police on 30 June; he was questioned and released after about an hour. A nationwide strike called by the FDD was held on 1 July and was deemed partially successful by the press.\n\nThe referendum was held on 4 August 2009, despite the opposition's furious objections and calls for a boycott, and it was successful. Speaking on 8 August, shortly after the announcement of results, Issoufou vowed that the opposition would \"resist and fight against this \"coup d'etat\" enacted by President Tandja and against his aim of installing a dictatorship in our country\".\n\nOn 14 September 2009, Issoufou was charged with misappropriation of funds and then released on bail. He said that he was actually charged for political reasons. He left the country. On 29 October 2009, international warrants for the arrest of Issoufou and Hama Amadou were issued by the Nigerien government, and Issoufou returned to Niamey from Nigeria late on 30 October in order \"to cooperate with the judiciary\".\n\nTandja was ousted in a February 2010 military coup, and a new transitional junta enabled the opposition leaders to return to politics in Niger while preparing for elections in 2011. At a meeting in early November 2010, the PNDS designated Issoufou as the party's candidate for the January 2011 presidential election. Issoufou said on the occasion that \"the moment has come, the conditions are right\", and he called on party members to \"turn these conditions into votes at the ballot box\". Some observers considered Issoufou to be potentially the strongest candidate in the election.\n\nIssoufou won the January–March 2011 presidential election in a second round of voting against MNSD candidate Seyni Oumarou and was inaugurated as President on 7 April 2011, succeeding Salou Djibo, the Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy. He named Brigi Rafini as Prime Minister.\n\nIn July 2011, a planned assassination of Issoufou was allegedly uncovered. A major, lieutenant, and three other soldiers in Niger's military were arrested.\n\nOn 7 November 2015, the PNDS designated Issoufou as its candidate for the 2016 presidential election. In February 2016 Issoufou won 48% of the votes in the first round of the elections. As no candidate obtained a majority a second round was needed. A coalition of opposition parties boycotted the second round. Issoufou subsequently won with 92.5% of the votes. He has been described by \"The Economist\" as \"a staunch ally of the West\".\n"}
{"id": "2305252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305252", "title": "Will contract", "text": "Will contract\n\nA will contract is a term used in the law of wills describing a contract to exchange a current performance for a future bequest. In such an agreement, one party (the promisee) will provide some performance in exchange for a promise by the other party (the testator, because they must draft a will) to make a specific bequest to the promisee party in the testator's will. Most jurisdictions recognize such contracts as valid, although a few hold them as void against public policy. Some jurisdictions will not recognize an oral contract for such a purpose, requiring instead that the contract be executed in writing and signed by both parties. Some jurisdictions require full compliance with the Statute of Wills to be effective, i.e., in writing and signed in the presence of two witnesses.\n\nThe general rule, where such contracts are recognized, is that the promisee can not specifically enforce the contract if the testator later revokes or supersedes the will making the promised bequest, but can only sue the testator's estate for breach of contract. This protects the testator's very strong freedom to dispose of his property however he sees fit. For example, suppose Joey agrees to execute a will bequeathing his house to Rachel in exchange for services provided by Rachel. If Joey later revokes that will, Rachel can not force Joey's estate to convey the house to her, but can only sue for the value of the house.\n\nTypically, will contracts are made between people who have different heirs to whom they wish to leave their property at death, but they may wish for the other person to have the use of until all of their combined assets until the death of the second to die. A married couple with children from an earlier marriage is a good example. The husband may leave his separate estate to his wife at his death, instead of directly to his children from his earlier marriage and in exchange, she may agree to combine his separate estate with her separate estate at her death and split the combined estate up between all of their children. It would work the same if she died first. A will contract only becomes irrevocable only at the first party's death. Because of differences in state laws regarding will contracts, an estate planning attorney should be consulted before use of this planning device.\n\nThe law behind wills becomes tedious when many parties are not present, typically in cases with limited family members. This mainly occurred after World War Two where many wills had no possible recipients so the assets went to the government. Wills are often confused with trust funds, but wills are only present at death whereas trust funds can be accessed during the time that the creator of the fund is still alive.\n"}
{"id": "2305259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305259", "title": "High Court (Hong Kong)", "text": "High Court (Hong Kong)\n\nThe High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, consists of the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance; it deals with criminal and civil cases which have risen beyond the lower courts. It is a superior court of record of unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction. It was named the Supreme Court before 1997. Though previously named the Supreme Court, this Court has long been the local equivalent to the Senior Courts of England and Wales and has never been vested with the power of final adjudication.\n\nA person who has practised for at least 10 years as a barrister, advocate, solicitor or judicial officer in Hong Kong or another common law jurisdiction is eligible to be appointed as a High Court Judge or Recorder. A person who has practised for at least 5 years as a barrister, advocate, solicitor or judicial officer in Hong Kong or another common law jurisdiction is eligible to be appointed as the Registrar or a Master.\n\nFull-time Judges and Recorders, as well as the Registrar and Masters, are appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the independent Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission (JORC).\n\nPart-time Deputy Judges are appointed on a temporary basis by the Chief Justice.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a person to sit as a Recorder or Deputy High Court Judge prior to appointment as a full-time High Court Judge.\n\nWhere a newly-appointed High Court Judge has previously served as the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Department of Justice, he or she is subject to a 'sanitisation' period of 6 months upon appointment during which he or she does not deal with any criminal trials or appeals or any civil cases involving the Government to maintain judicial independence and impartiality.\n\nUpon appointment as a full-time High Court Judge, one must give an undertaking not to return to practise in future as a barrister or solicitor in Hong Kong.\n\nThe remuneration of High Court Judges is determined by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the independent Standing Committee on Judicial Salaries and Conditions of Service. As of 1 April 2017, a full-time Judge of the Court of First Instance receives a monthly salary of HK$292,650, while a Justice of Appeal receives a monthly salary of HK$307,050. The Chief Judge of the High Court receives a monthly salary of HK$340,600. Further, full-time Judges are provided with housing in Judiciary Quarters or, alternatively, a housing allowance at HK$163,525 per month. As of 1 April 2020, Recorders and Deputy High Court Judges receive honoraria at a daily rate of HK$11,765.\n\nThe retirement age of full-time High Court Judges is 70. However, the term of office can be extended further up to the age of 75.\n\nThe Chief Judge of the High Court is the Court Leader of the High Court and the President of the Court of Appeal. He or she is responsible for the administration of the High Court and is accountable to the Chief Justice, who is head of the Judiciary. He or she must be a Chinese citizen who is a Hong Kong permanent resident with no right of abode in any foreign country.\n\nThe Judges who have held the position of Chief Judge of the High Court of Hong Kong to date are:\n\n\nFor pre-1997 Chief Justices, see: Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong\n\nFull-time High Court Judges are given the prefix ‘the Honourable’ and referred to as ‘Mr/Madam/Mrs Justice [surname]’. The Chief Judge of the High Court may be referred to in writing by adding the post-nominal \"CJHC\". Vice Presidents of the Court of Appeal may be referred to in writing by adding the post-nominal \"VP\". Justices of Appeal may be referred to in writing by adding the post-nominal \"JA\".\n\nIn 1995, Mrs Justice Doreen Le Pichon was the first woman to be appointed as a High Court Judge. She subsequently became the first woman to be appointed as a Justice of Appeal in 2000. In 2019, Madam Justice Susan Kwan was the first woman to be appointed as Vice President of the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe current full-time Judges of the High Court (as at 18 December 2019) are (ranked according to the priority of their respective appointments):\n\nChief Judge of the High Court\n\nJustices of Appeal of the Court of Appeal of the High Court\n\nJudges of the Court of First Instance of the High Court\n\nA Justice of Appeal may sit as an additional Judge of the Court of First Instance. A Judge of the Court of First Instance may also hear cases in the Court of Appeal, including as a single Judge (for example, when determining applications for leave to appeal in criminal cases).\n\nCases in the Court of First Instance are usually heard by a single Judge, though important cases may be heard by a bench consisting of more than one Judge, although this is very rare. This practice is similar to the English High Court, where important cases may be heard by a Divisional Court consisting of a three- or two-member bench.\n\nAll Judges of the Court of First Instance also serve as members of the Competition Tribunal. The President and Deputy President of the Competition Tribunal (currently Mr Justice Godfrey Lam and Madam Justice Au-Yeung respectively) are appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission.\n\nThe President of the Lands Tribunal must be a High Court Judge (currently Madam Justice Lisa Wong) and is appointed by the Chief Executive.\n\nHigh Court Judges also serve a number of other public service roles. It is a statutory requirement that the Electoral Affairs Commission be headed by a Chairman who is a High Court Judge (currently Mr Justice Fung) appointed by the Chief Executive in consultation with the Chief Justice. The Electoral Affairs Commission must appoint a Judge of the Court of Final Appeal or a High Court Judge to act as returning officer for elections for the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Similarly, it is a statutory requirement that the Chief Executive appoint a serving or retired High Court Judge to be Commissioner on Interception of Communications and Surveillance (currently Mr Justice Suffiad). The Chief Executive also appoints three to six Judges of the Court of First Instance (currently Mr Justice Fung, Mr Justice Bharwaney and Madam Justice Lisa Wong) on the recommendation of the Chief Justice to serve as panel judges handling interception and surveillance authorisation requests from law enforcement agencies. Further, it is a statutory requirement that the Chief Executive appoint at least 2 serving or retired High Court Judges as members of the Long-term Prison Sentences Review Board. At present, Mr Justice Pang Kin-kee and Mr Justice Wilson Chan are President and Deputy President respectively of the Long-term Prison Sentences Review Board. It is also a statutory requirement that the Chief Executive appoint a retired High Court Judge, District Judge or magistrate as Chairman of the Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions (currently Mr Justice Pang Kin-kee). In addition, it is a statutory requirement that the Chief Executive appoint a serving or retired High Court Judge or Deputy High Court Judge to chair the Market Misconduct Tribunal (MMT) and the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal (SFAT). At present, Mr Justice Lunn (former Vice President of the Court of Appeal), Mr Justice Hartmann (former Justice of Appeal), Kenneth Kwok SC (former Recorder of the Court of First Instance) and His Honour Judge Tallentire (former Deputy High Court Judge) are Chairmen of the MMT and SFAT.\n\nThe Chief Executive may appoint a High Court Judge to lead a public inquiry. For example, Mr Justice Andrew Chan was appointed in 2015 as Chairman of the Inquiry into incidents of excess lead found in drinking water, and Mr Justice Lunn, JA was appointed in 2012 as Chairman of the Inquiry into the collision of vessels near Lamma Island.\n\nA number of serving and retired Hong Kong High Court Judges also sit as Supreme Court Judges in Brunei. For example, while Mr Justice Rogers served as Vice President of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal, he also sat as a non-resident Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Brunei Darussalam between 2010 and 2011. As of 2019, three retired Hong Kong High Court Judges sit as Judges of the Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam (Mr Justice Burrell, who is the President of the Brunei Court of Appeal, and Mr Justice Seagroatt and Mr Justice Lunn, who are Justices of Appeal); two retired Hong Kong High Court Judges sit as Judicial Commissioners of the High Court of Brunei Darussalam (Mr Justice Findlay and Mr Justice Lugar-Mawson). Another retired Hong Kong Judge, Edward Woolley, who previously sat as a Deputy High Court Judge and High Court Master, also sits as a Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Brunei Darussalam.\n\nRecorders are practitioners in private practice (in practice, Senior Counsel) who are appointed for a fixed term of a few years and sit for a few weeks in a year. Recorders may exercise all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges of a full-time Judge of the Court of First Instance.\n\nThe recordership scheme was introduced in 1994 to encourage experienced practitioners who are willing to sit as a High Court Judge for a few weeks every year, but are not prepared to commit themselves to a permanent, full-time appointment. It was intended to act as a more formal system of appointment compared to the more ad hoc nature of appointment of Deputy High Court Judges.\n\nThe current Recorders of the Court of First Instance of the High Court (as at 6 January 2020) are (ranked according to the priority of their respective appointments):\n\nThe Chief Justice appoints on a temporary basis a number of serving full-time District Court Judges, retired High Court Judges and practitioners in private practice (in general, barristers who are Senior Counsel or solicitors who are senior partners with litigation experience) to sit as part-time Deputy High Court Judges. Before 1983, the position of Deputy High Court Judge was known as Commissioner.\n\nA Deputy High Court Judge may exercise all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges of a full-time Judge of the Court of First Instance.\n\nJudicial review cases are not listed before part-time Judges.\n\nIn order to ensure judicial independence and impartiality, part-time Judges are not permitted to participate actively in political activities (although membership of a political party is acceptable).\n\nAll High Court Judges (regardless of whether they are full-time Judges, Recorders or Deputy Judges on temporary appointment) are addressed in court as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\".\n\nIn court judgments and decisions, Vice Presidents of the Court of Appeal are referred to as '[surname] VP' or '[surname] V-P' (or in the plural as '[surname] and [surname] V-PP'). Justices of Appeal are referred to as '[surname] JA' (or in the plural as '[surname] and [surname] JJA'). Full-time Judges of the Court of First Instance are referred to as '[surname] J' (or in the plural as '[surname] and [surname] JJ'). Recorders are referred to as 'Mr/Madam/Mrs Recorder [surname]' (with the post-nominal 'SC' if they are Senior Counsel). Deputy High Court Judges are referred to either as 'Deputy Judge [surname]', 'Deputy High Court Judge [surname]' or 'DHCJ [surname]' (with the post-nominal 'SC' if they are Senior Counsel). Deputy High Court Judges were previously called Commissioners and were referred to as [Mr/Madam/Mrs Commissioner [surname]' (with the post-nominal 'Q.C.' if they were Queen's Counsel) in judgments before 1983.\n\nThe High Court Building is located at 38 Queensway, Admiralty. The 20-storey building was built in 1985 as the home of the then Supreme Court of Hong Kong, which was renamed in 1997. It was named the Supreme Court Building, and the road leading to its main entrance is still named Supreme Court Road. The High Court Building was designed by Architect K. M. Tseng.\n\nThe structure is a white clad tower and has a water fountain outside its front door.\n\nSometimes, the High Court may sit in another venue. For example, a serving District Judge sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge may hear a case in a courtroom situated in the District Court building. This is similar to England, where the High Court sometimes sits outside London in County Courts which act as High Court District Registries.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2305280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305280", "title": "By the Pricking of My Thumbs", "text": "By the Pricking of My Thumbs\n\nBy the Pricking of My Thumbs is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in November 1968 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. The UK edition retailed at twenty-one shillings (21/-) and the US edition at $4.95. It features her detectives Tommy and Tuppence Beresford.\n\nTommy and Tuppence are elderly in this work (they aged from novel to novel). \n\nThe title of the book comes from Act 4, Scene 1 of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", when the second witch says:\n\nBy the pricking of my thumbs,<br>Something wicked this way comes.\n\nThe novel is divided into four books.\n\nIn Book 1 Tommy and Tuppence Beresford visit Tommy’s aunt Ada in a retirement home called Sunny Ridge. While Tommy talks with his aunt, Tuppence has a conversation with another resident, Mrs Lancaster, who unexpectedly says \"Was it your poor child? There behind the fireplace.\"\n\nA few weeks later Aunt Ada dies of natural causes. When they return to the home after the funeral to make arrangements for Ada’s possessions, they find that Mrs Lancaster has suddenly departed. The matron tells them that a relative called Mrs Johnson took her away. Tuppence suspects there’s more to it and tries to find the relative but the trail turns cold. One of the items Aunt Ada had left is a painting of a house by a river. The picture strongly reminds Tuppence of a house she once saw and immediately liked. The painting was supposedly given to Aunt Ada by Mrs Lancaster.\n\nIn Book 2 Tommy is away for a few days, so Tuppence starts looking for the mystery house on her own. Eventually she finds it in a small village called Sutton Chancellor. It turns out that the house is divided in a peculiar way. The back part of the house is rented by a middle-aged couple called the Perrys. The front part has been vacant for years. Tuppence meets with the people of Sutton Chancellor. There is an elderly vicar, a talkative B&B landlady called Mrs Copleigh, and a Miss Bligh who seems to run the parish.\n\nUnder the pretence of house hunting, Tuppence tries to get more information about the house. Mrs. Copleigh tells her a grim story about a spate of child killings some years ago. Then Tuppence fails to return home on the arranged day, having been concussed by a blow to the head.\n\nIn Book 3 Tommy and his servant Albert are worried about Tuppence. Tommy does some investigation on his own. He discovers the painting was by an artist called Boscowan who died several years ago. Tommy meets with the doctor of Sunny Ridge. There have been some deaths that the doctor finds odd and he is worried about possible foul play. Tommy then talks to an investigator friend who hints the house in Sutton Chancellor might have been used as a safe house for a criminal gang. Tommy shows the painting to Mrs Boscowan, who notes that someone has added a boat to the picture. At home, Tommy learns that Tuppence is in a hospital near Sutton Chancellor with severe concussion. Tommy and Albert then find a hidden letter from Aunt Ada, in which she suspects there is malice in Sunny Ridge.\n\nIn Book 4 Tuppence has recovered. An old doll she found in the mysterious house turns out to contain uncut diamonds. A party is arranged in Sutton Chancellor. Sir Phillip Starke, the local landowner, and Mrs Boscowan are invited. Tuppence has the impression that Sir Phillip knows more about the whole affair. The next day Tuppence goes to the vicarage and confronts Miss Bligh, who she suspects was the one who hit her on the head.\n\nAlone, Tuppence goes to the mystery house and to her surprise finds the missing Mrs Lancaster. She takes Tuppence to a secret part of the house and proceeds to tell her life story. She was a wild child, a dancer, who got pregnant young. After she chose to abort the baby (“I was a dancer, I didn’t want a child... the doctor said it would be all right, but it wasn’t all right”), she took up with a criminal gang; they used the house to hide their loot. Later she left that life behind and got married, hoping to have a family, but could not conceive again and in her grief and guilt over the abortion became unhinged and started killing children. “The only way to atone for the first murder was more murders— they were sacrifices, see?” \n\nOne of the other residents, Mrs Moody, in Sunny Ridge had recognised her, so she had to be silenced. Miss Bligh, posing as a relative, resettled her into a new home. After her candour, Mrs Lancaster attempts to kill Tuppence, first with poisoned milk, then with a metal blade.\n\nTuppence is saved just in time. It is revealed that Mrs Lancaster is actually the wife of Sir Phillip Starke. He had covered up her insanity and the crimes she committed. He was assisted in the cover-up by Miss Bligh, his former secretary and confidante. Tommy and Tuppence then return home.\n\nThe novel is dedicated \"to the many readers in this and other countries who write to me asking: 'What has happened to Tommy and Tuppence? What are they doing now?'\"\n\nFrancis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) in \"The Guardian\"'s issue of 13 December 1968 admitted that, \"This is a thriller, not a detective story, and needless to say an ingenious and exciting one; but anyone can write a thriller (well, almost anyone), whereas a genuine Agatha Christie could be written by one person only.\"\n\nMaurice Richardson in \"The Observer\" of 17 November 1968 said, \"Not her best though it has patches of her cosy euphoria and aura of the sinister.\"\n\nRobert Barnard said that this novel \"Begins rather well, with a vicious old aunt of Tommy's in a genteel old people's home, but declines rapidly into a welter of half-realised plots and a plethora of those conversations, all too familiar in late Christie, which meander on through irrelevancies, repetitions and inconsequentialities to end nowhere (as if she had sat at the feet of Samuel Beckett).” He concluded his negative assessment of the plot by saying that it “Makes one appreciate the economy of dialogue – all point, or at least possible point, in early Christie.\"\n\nIn 2005, the novel was adapted by the French director Pascal Thomas under the title \"Mon petit doigt m'a dit...\"\n\nThe novel was adapted into a television movie in 2006 as part of the \"Marple\" series starring Geraldine McEwan even though Christie did not write Marple into the original story. The plot was altered with Tommy away on military intelligence business abroad, and Tommy's part of the story was re-written for Miss Marple. Tommy was portrayed as a self-important strong male, while Tuppence was portrayed as a maudlin alcoholic who carried a hip flask and who was resentful of her husband's success; she too was going to be signed-up by MI6 but had then not been able to fulfill this ambition as she was pregnant with their first child. Tommy and Tuppence were played by Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi. The time in which this adaption is set is somewhere between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, but unclear and slightly inconsistent: a US B-17 (which left the UK soon after the war and was out of US service by 1949) overflies the village, yet US airmen wear the blue USAF uniform introduced in 1949, and there is also a 1951 Festival of Britain poster in the village shop.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2305289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305289", "title": "Silvio Pellico", "text": "Silvio Pellico\n\nSilvio Pellico (; 24 June 1789 – 31 January 1854) was an Italian writer, poet, dramatist and patriot active in the Italian unification.\n\nSilvio Pellico was born in Saluzzo (Piedmont). He spent the earlier portion of his life at Pinerolo and Turin, under the tuition of a priest named Manavella. At the age of ten he composed a tragedy inspired by a translation of the Ossianic poems. On the marriage of his twin sister Rosina with a maternal cousin at Lyon, he went to reside in that city, devoting himself during four years to the study of French literature. He returned in 1810 to Milan, where he became professor of French in the Collegio degli Orfani Militari, now the Scuola Militare Teulié.\n\nHis tragedy \"Francesca da Rimini\" was brought out with success by Carlotta Marchionni at Milan in 1818. Its publication was followed by that of the tragedy \"Euphemio da Messina\", but the representation of the latter was forbidden. \n\nPellico had in the meantime continued his work as tutor, first to the unfortunate son of Count Briche, and then to the two sons of Count . He threw himself heartily into an attempt to weaken the hold of the Austrian despotism by indirect educational means. \n\nThe \"Conciliatore\", a review, appeared in 1818. Of the powerful literary executives that gathered about Counts Porro and Confalonieri, Pellico was the able secretary on whom most of the responsibility for the review, the organ of the association, fell. But the paper, under the censorship of the Austrian officials, ran for a year only, and the society itself was broken up by the government. In October 1820, Pellico was arrested on the charge of carbonarism and conveyed to the Santa Margherita prison. After his removal to the Piombi at Venice in February 1821, he composed several Cantiche and the tragedies \"Ester d'Engaddi\" and \"Iginici d'Asti\".\nThe sentence of death pronounced on him in February 1822 was finally commuted to fifteen years of jail in harsh condition, and in the following April he was placed in the Spielberg, at Brünn (today's Brno), where he was transferred via Udine and Ljubljana. His chief work during this part of his imprisonment was the tragedy \"Leoniero da Dertona\", for the preservation of which he was compelled to rely on his memory. \n\nAfter his release in 1830, he commenced the publication of his prison compositions, of which the Ester was played at Turin in 1831, but immediately suppressed. In 1832, his \"Gismonda da Mendrisio\", \"Erodiade\" and the \"Leoniero\" , appeared under the title of \"Tre nuove tragedie\", and in the same year the work which gave him his European fame, \"\", an account of his sufferings in prison. The last gained him the friendship of the Marchesa Juliette Colbert de Barolo, the reformer of the Turin prisons, and in 1834 he accepted from her a yearly pension of 1200 francs. His tragedy \"Tommaso Moro\" had been published in 1833, his most important subsequent publication being the \"Opere inedite\" in 1837. \n\nOn the decease of his parents in 1838, he was received into the Casa Barolo, where he remained until his death, assisting the marchesa in her charities, and writing chiefly upon religious themes. Of these works the best known is the \"Dei doveri degli uomini\", a series of trite maxims which do honor to his piety rather than to his critical judgment. A fragmentary biography of the marchesa by Pellico was published in Italian and English after her death. \n\nHe died in 1854 at Turin. He was buried in the Camposanto, Turin.\n\nThe simple narrative and naive egotism of \"Le mie prigioni\" has established his strongest claim to remembrance, winning fame by his misfortunes rather than by his genius.The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read the work, in Italian, whilst staying in Naples in November 1888. \"My prisons\" contributed to the Italian unification, against Austrian occupation. The pamphlet was translated into virtually every European language during Pellico's lifetime.\n\nSilvio Pellico gave his name to a little community (1,500 inhabitants) founded in Argentina by Italian immigrants from Saluzzo.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a former head of the Department of Politics, Languages and International Studies there. His 2011 articles investigating how the World Health Organization addressed the 2009 flu pandemic, anticipated the cultural and institutional responses to COVID-19 which, he proposed, would lead to considerably more fatalities than the virus itself. His concern since, was that the episode would lead to: \"\"suspicion, avoidance and intolerance towards others, an unwillingness to embrace life’s uncertainties, fear of future emergencies, a dystopian, anti-human outlook and narrative, and all too willing acceptance of the curtailment of civil liberties, combined with a paralysing dependence on others\"\".\n\nHis inaugural professorial lecture: The Politics of Risk and Resilience - Fear and Terror in a World without Meaning, was delivered on 29 October 2015. In June 2016, rejecting all of the official campaigns, he argued on the grounds of democratic accountability and moral autonomy for the UK to give up its membership of the European Union. He noted soon after the vote that, despite the largest mandate in British history, politicians and others would seek to deliver Brexit in name alone, but not in spirit.\n\nHe was formerly Professor in the School of Humanitarian Studies at Royal Roads University in Victoria, British Columbia, where he was Program Head for the Conflict Analysis and Management programs. He maintains an on-going role as an Associate Faculty member there. Before that he held positions coordinating the Homeland Defence research programme and then the Health and Human Security research programme within the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, as well as in the Department of Defence Management and Security Analysis at Cranfield University, part of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom at Shrivenham, and in the War Studies Group of King's College London.\n\nIn 2014 he was appointed as a Visiting Professor to CELAP – the China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong – one of China's top four national 'Party Schools', in Shanghai - a position officially renewed in 2018. He has also conducted short courses for officials through the Shanghai Administration Institute, and writes on the West's evolving relations with China, as well as recent events surrounding the protests in Hong Kong. He was an Associate Fellow of the International Security Programme at Chatham House - Europe's leading think-tank - in London for over a decade.\nHis main research interest is to examine the causes and consequences of contemporary perceptions of risk, as well as how these are framed and communicated across a wide range of contemporary social issues. His work explores the limitations of risk management and of the so-called precautionary principle. He has questioned the motivations behind the growing demand to engage the public in dialogue and decision-making in relation to science. He has also sought to draw attention to the parallels between Islamist terrorism and contemporary Western nihilism, noting that many who engage in the former draw their roots from the latter and specifically stating that 'Islam, for them at least, was more a motif than a motive'.\n\nHe publicly defended the need for BP to continue its exploration work in the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and he supported the initial response of the Japanese authorities to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant emergency. On the other hand, he has questioned the dynamic behind environmental campaigns against pulp and palm-oil producers in Indonesia, as well as the British government's interpretation of the implications of the 2011 England riots.\n\nHis work proposes that Securitization (international relations) theory is too limited a framework through which to understand the British government's new Prevent Duty. This latter imposes new obligations on public bodies to tackle so-called Radicalization, which he proposes is better understood as being driven by a process of disengagement. He has also addressed what he sees as the demise of strategic thinking and a concomitant crisis of diplomacy, most recently evidenced by the responses of senior British government ministers to the Sergei Skripal, former-spy poisoning episode in the UK.\nDurodié was educated at the Royal College of Science, part of Imperial College London, where he studied Physics. After completing a final year undergraduate project to map different types of supernovae onto the Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies, he was invited to start a PhD in Astronomy at the University of Manchester under the supervision of Professor Franz Daniel Kahn. Accordingly, his first research publication was in theoretical astrophysics, based on a paper he presented at Princeton University in 1986.\n\nHe then changed course, first pursuing a career in teaching (becoming Head of Maths at two inner-city comprehensive schools) and then urban regeneration (working in both the public and private sectors). During this time he also studied for a Master's degree in European Social Policy at the London School of Economics, and subsequently embarked on another PhD, this time in Politics, at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Professor Christopher Hood. There, shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001, he met Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman with whom he helped develop and then coordinated an ESRC funded project to study the responses to those events in collaboration with various researchers, including Professor Sir Simon Wessely.\n\nHaving left Oxford he completed his doctorate in Risk Communication through the Centre for Decision Analysis and Risk Management in the School of Health and Social Sciences of Middlesex University (UK), with Professor John Adams acting as an external examiner.\n\nHis publication list includes articles in leading journals, and on the reading lists of internationally recognized universities – as well as a noted media profile from both writing press commentaries and appearing in broadcasts. He featured in the 2004 BBC British Academy of Film and Television Arts award-winning documentary series produced by Adam Curtis; 'The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear'. His appearance prompted The Guardian newspaper journalist Madeleine Bunting to describe him as: \"\"one of the most perceptive commentators featured in the series\"\".\n\nDurodié was one of the founding members of the Manifesto Club, a network of individuals originally established to celebrate human achievement and challenge social, cultural and political pessimism. He is a regular speaker at the annual Battle of Ideas festival in London, and he gave the opening key-note address to the Society for Risk Analysis Europe Conference in 2016. On 15 November 2017, following in the steps of former US Secretary for Homeland Security Michael Chertoff and the UK Minister of State for Universities and Science David Willetts, he became the 8th person and first alumnus to give the annual Vincent Briscoe Lecture to the Institute for Security Science and Technology at Imperial College London.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2305319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305319", "title": "Amarna art", "text": "Amarna art\n\nAmarna art, or the Amarna style, is a style adopted in the Amarna Period during and just after the reign of Akhenaten (r. 1351–1334 BC) in the late Eighteenth Dynasty, during the New Kingdom. Whereas Ancient Egyptian art was famously slow to alter, the Amarna style was a significant and sudden break from its predecessor, which was restored after Akhenaten's death. It is characterized by a sense of movement and activity in images, with figures having raised heads, many figures overlapping and many scenes busy and crowded. The human body is portrayed differently; figures, always shown in profile on reliefs, are slender, swaying, with exaggerated extremities. In particular, depictions of Akhenaten give him distinctly feminine qualities such as large hips, prominent breasts, and a larger stomach and thighs. Other pieces, such as the most famous of all Amarna works, the Nefertiti Bust in Berlin, show much less pronounced features of the style. \n\nAmenhotep IV was one of the first to practice monotheism, the belief in just one god. Shortly after claiming the throne, he declared the god Aten, represented by the sun, was the only true god. To pay homage to his chosen god, Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akenaten. Throughout his rule, Akenaten tried to change many aspects of Egyptian culture to celebrate or praise his god, especially the style and usage of art.\n\nThe illustration of figures' hands and feet are apparently important. Fingers and toes are depicted as long and slender and are carefully detailed to show nails. Artists also showed subjects with elongated facial structures accompanied by folds within the skin as well as lowered eyelids. The figure was also illustrated with a more elongated body than the previous representation. In the new human form, the subject had more fat in the stomach, thigh, and breast region, while the torso, arm, and legs were thin and long like the rest of the body. The skin color of both male and female is generally dark brown (contrasted with the usual dark brown or red for males and light brown or white for females). Figures in this style are shown with both a left and a right foot, contrasting the traditional style of being shown with either two left or two right feet.\n\nAkenaten moved the royal capital to the city now known as Amarna and erected a number of palaces and temples there. After his death, conservative forces led by the temple priests reimposed the old religion. The new capital was abandoned, and traces of his monuments elsewhere defaced. Remains of Amarna art are therefore concentrated in Amarna itself, with other remains at Karnak, where large reliefs in the style were dismantled, and the blocks turned round to face inwards when a later building was constructed using them. These were only rediscovered in recent decades. It is now also thought that several of the objects in the tomb of Akenaten's son Tutankhamun were originally made for his father; for example, the relief on his throne.\n\nThe decoration of the tombs of non-royals is quite different from previous eras. These tombs do not feature any funerary or agricultural scenes, nor do they include the tomb occupant unless he or she is depicted with a member of the royal family. There is an absence of gods and goddesses, apart from the Aten, the sundisc. However, the Aten does not shine its rays on the tomb owner, only on members of the royal family. There is neither a mention of Osiris nor other funerary figures. There is also no mention of a journey through the underworld. Instead, excerpts from the Hymn to the Aten are generally present. \nSculptures from the Amarna period are set apart from other periods of Egyptian art. One reason for this is the accentuation of certain features. For instance, the portrayals feature an elongation and narrowing of the neck and head, sloping of the forehead and nose, a prominent chin, large ears and lips, spindle-like arms and calves, and large thighs, stomachs and hips.\n\nIn a relief of Akhenaten, he is portrayed in an intimate setting with his primary wife, Nefertiti, and their children, the six princesses. His children appear to be fully grown, only shrunken to appear smaller than their parents, a routine stylistic feature of traditional Egyptian art. They also have elongated necks and bodies. An unfinished head of a princess from this time, in the \"Tutankhamun, and the golden age of the pharaohs\" exhibition, displays a very prominent elongation to the back of the head.\n\nThe unusual, elongated skull shape often used in portrayal of the royal family \"may be a slightly exaggerated treatment of a hereditary trait of the Amarna royal family\", according to the Brooklyn Museum, given that \"the mummy of Tutankhamun, presumed to be related to Akhenaten, has a similarly shaped skull, although not so elongated as [in typical Amarna-style art]\". However, it is possible that the style is purely ritualistic.\nThe hands at the end of each ray extending from Aten in the relief are delivering the ankh, which symbolized \"life\" in the Egyptian culture, to Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and often also reach the portrayed princesses. The importance of the Sun God Aten is central to much of the Amarna period art, largely because Akhenaten's rule was marked by the monotheistic following of Aten.\n\nIn several sculptures of Akhenaten, if not most, he has wide hips and a visible paunch. His lips are thick, and his arms and legs are thin and lack muscular tone, unlike his counterparts of other eras in Egyptian artwork. Some scholars suggest that the presentation of the human body as imperfect during the Amarna period is in deference to Aten. Others think Akhenaten suffered from a genetic disorder, most likely the product of inbreeding, that caused him to look that way. Others interpret this unprecedented stylistic break from Egyptian tradition to be a reflection of the Amarna Royals' attempts to wrest political power from the traditional priesthood and bureaucratic authorities.\n\nMuch of the finest work, including the famous Nefertiti bust in Berlin, was found in the studio of the second and last Royal Court Sculptor Thutmose, and is now in Berlin and Cairo, with some in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nThe period saw the use of sunk relief, previously used for large external reliefs, extended to small carvings, and used for most monumental reliefs. Sunk relief appears best in strong sunlight. This was one innovation that had a lasting effect, as raised relief is rare in later periods.\n\nNot many buildings from this period have survived the ravages of later kings, partially as they were constructed out of standard size blocks, known as talatat, which were very easy to remove and reuse. In recent decades, re-building work on later buildings has revealed large number of reused blocks from the period, with the original carved faces turned inwards, greatly increasing the amount of work known from the period.\n\nTemples in Amarna did not follow the traditional Egyptian design. They were smaller, with sanctuaries open to the sun, containing large numbers of altars. They had no closing doors. See Great Temple of the Aten, Small Temple of the Aten and the Temple of Amenhotep IV.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2305336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305336", "title": "Quartz Composer", "text": "Quartz Composer\n\nQuartz Composer is a node-based visual programming language provided as part of the Xcode development environment in macOS for processing and rendering graphical data.\n\nQuartz Composer uses OpenGL (including GLSL), OpenCL (only in Mac OS X 10.6 and later), Core Image, Core Video, JavaScript, and other technologies to create an API and a developer tool around a simple visual programming paradigm. Apple has embedded Quartz technologies deeply into the operating system. Compositions created in Quartz Composer can be played standalone in any QuickTime-aware application (although only on Mac OS X 10.4 and later), as a system Screen Saver, as an iTunes Visualizer, from inside the Quartz Composer application, or can be embedded into a Cocoa or Carbon application via supplied user interface widgets. While Quartz Composer is included with the iPhone SDK, there is no way of running Quartz Compositions on iOS devices. Starting in macOS 10.15, the Quartz Composer framework has been deprecated, although it is still present for compatibility.\n\nQuartz programming through Quartz Composer works by implementing and connecting \"patches\". Similar to routines in traditional programming languages, patches are base processing units. They execute and produce a result. For better performance, patch execution follows a lazy evaluation approach, meaning that patches are only executed when their output is needed. There are three types of patches: Consumers, Processors, and External Input patches that can receive and output mouse clicks, scrolls, and movements; MIDI and audio; keyboard; or other movements. A collection of patches can be melded into one, called a macro. Macros can be nested and their subroutines also edited.\n\nTo control the order of rendering, each renderer is assigned a layer, indicated in its upper-right corner. Layers are rendered sequentially, lowest to highest. Renderers can be enabled or disabled, essentially turning on or off that particular layer. Turning off unused layers often results in better performance, since fewer upstream patches need to be evaluated.\n\nSome patches can have subpatches, which allows for global parameter changes to just the included subpatches. This is useful for lighting, 3D transformation, and GLSL shaders, among other things. Subpatch support is indicated by square corners on a patch, rather than the typical rounded corners.\n\nWith Version 3.0, it became possible to turn compositions into Virtual Patches. These allow the user to reuse functionality without having to store duplicate copies in each composition. The Quartz Composer Editor allows the user to save a \"flattened\" copy (with the virtual patches fully expanded inside), for easy distribution. Version 4.0 extended this functionality even more, and automatically includes \"flattened\" copies of virtual patches for use as a fallback if the desired virtual patch isn't installed on the host system. This greatly simplifies composition distribution.\n\nNetwork functionality was greatly improved with the release of Leopard. It became possible to transmit data and synchronize over a network interface, and it also added support for Open Sound Control transmission and reception.\n\nAlso new in Version 3.0 was the possibility to write custom patch plugins, using an Xcode template, and the notion of a \"safe mode\", where plugins and other unsafe patches fail to load. This prevents malicious compositions from performing dangerous or insecure operations. Custom patches using Apple's Xcode template are always considered unsafe.\n\nIt was possible to develop custom patch plugins for Version 2.0, but the API was undocumented and private, and was never supported by Apple. Eventually, templates were released to simplify this procedure.\n\nIn the Quartz Composer editor, holding the option key while selecting \"Preferences...\" from the menu adds 3 additional tabs of options for the user to configure. These options include System settings, Editor settings, and QuickTime integration settings. Notable options include expanded tooltips, software rendering, and uncapped framerate rendering. Multisample antialiasing (MSAA) was added as a hidden option in version 4.0, allowing for antialiasing inside the QC Editor, though it only works on GPU's that support MSAA.\n\nData inside QC can be one of the following types:\n\nTwo additional types were introduced in version 4.0:\n\nData can usually be converted to other types transparently. In Quartz Composer 3.0, the connections between patches change color to indicate conversions that are taking place. Yellow connections mean no conversion is taking place, Orange indicates a possible loss of data from conversion (Number to Index), and Red indicates a severe conversion; Image to Boolean, for example.\n\nQuartz Composer documents are called \"Compositions\". Compositions are Binary Property Lists (though XML versions are also supported) with a filename extension \".qtz\", and a \"com.apple.quartz-composer-composition\" UTI. Patches, their connections, and their input port states are saved in the composition file. Images can be stored inside a composition as well, making for self-contained compositions with embedded graphics. By dragging a movie file into the Quartz Composer editor, a reference to the movie file is created, providing a changing image that can be connected to a renderer.\n\nCompositions also store metadata such as composition author, copyright, and description. The user can also add arbitrary metadata items, if desired.\n\nMany image formats are supported, including JPEG, JPEG2000, GIF, PNG, TIFF, TGA, OpenEXR, BMP, ICO, PDF, PICT, ICNS, and some raw digital camera types. Images are maintained in their native form for as long as possible before rasterizing for display. This means that Quartz Composer will keep vector images as vectors when cropping, scaling, rotating, or translating which allows it to work with very large logical image dimensions without consuming large amounts of memory or processing time. Such functionality is most apparent when working with text-based images, or PDFs.\n\nVersion 3.0 added the ability to add annotations to areas of the composition, called \"notes\". These notes parallel comments in other programming languages. Notes can be yellow, red, green, blue, or gray, and can overlap other notes.\n\nIn Version 3.0, the concept of Composition Protocols was introduced. Protocols provide a template of required and optional inputs and outputs to qualify conforming compositions for various purposes. The following protocols are available by default:\n\nThere is an additional protocol that Apple uses in their private API:\n\nOne new protocol was added in version 4.0:\n\nThere is no officially supported way to add additional protocols to Quartz Composer. However, there are some undocumented methods that may make this possible in the future.\n\nIn addition to protocols, compositions can also conform to different runtimes where Quartz Composer is available. In Leopard, there are runtimes for Tiger (32-bit), as well as 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the Leopard Quartz Composer runtime. The editor can also indicate used patches that are unsafe, or unavailable in Tiger to aid in making compatible compositions.\n\nA System-wide Composition Repository is available as of Version 3.0. This allows applications to share and make use of common compositions for effects and processing. It is also possible for applications to query the repository for compositions that match certain criteria, such as protocol conformance.\n\nThe Repository is spread across 3 file system locations:\n\nAdding compositions to the repository is as simple as adding the composition file to one of these locations.\n\nIt became possible to compare compositions in Quartz Composer 3.0. This feature allows the user to compare inputs, rendered output, and graph appearance of any two compositions.\n\nA developer tool called Quartz Composer Visualizer was released with Quartz Composer 3.0 that allows compositions to be rendered across multiple screens on a single machine, or even spanned across several machines and displays.\n\nSupport for some Automator actions was added with the release of Leopard.\n\nPierre-Olivier Latour originally developed the predecessor to Quartz Composer under the name PixelShox Studio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is credited with having coined the name \"Nigeria\".\n\nShe was born at 2 Dundas Terrace, Woolwich, South London, the fourth of fourteen children, the daughter of an English father, Captain (later Major General) George Shaw, and a French mother, Marie Adrienne Josephine (née Desfontaines; 1826–1871), a native of Mauritius. She had nine sisters, the first and the last dying in infancy, and four brothers.\n\nHer paternal grandfather was Sir Frederick Shaw, third baronet (1799–1876), of Bushy Park, Dublin, and a member of parliament from 1830 to 1848, regarded as the leader of the Irish Conservatives. Her paternal grandmother, Thomasine Emily, was the sixth daughter of the Hon. George Jocelyn, and granddaughter of Robert Jocelyn, first Earl of Roden.\n\nFrom 1878 to 1886, Shaw wrote five novels, four for children and one for young adults. In her books, young girls are encouraged to be resourceful and brave but in a traditional framework, acting in support of \"gentlemanly\" fathers and prospective husbands, rather than on their own behalf. Shaw's ideology is both sexually conservative and imperialist.\n\n\nHer first children's novel, \"Castle Blair\", was translated into several languages and continued to be extremely popular in the UK and the US well into the 20th century. It was based on her own Anglo-Irish childhood experiences. Charlotte Yonge recommended it along with works of \"some of the most respected and loved authors available in late Victorian England\" as \"wild... attractive and exciting\". The critic John Ruskin called \"Castle Blair\" \"good, and lovely, and true\".\n\nShaw also wrote a history of Australia for children, \"The story of Australia\" (London: Horace Marshall, 1897), as part of the \"Story of the Empire\" series.\n\nShe began her career in journalism in 1886, writing for the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" and the \"Manchester Guardian\". She was sent by the \"Manchester Guardian\" newspaper and was the only woman reporter to cover the Anti-Slavery Conference in Brussels. She became Colonial Editor for \"The Times\", which made her the highest paid woman journalist of the time. In that connection, she was sent as a special correspondent to Southern Africa in 1892 and in 1901 and to Australia and New Zealand in 1892, partly to study the question of Kanaka labour in the sugar plantations of Queensland. Penneshaw, South Australia is partly named after her.\n\nShe also made two journeys to Canada, in 1893 and 1898, the second including a journey to the gold diggings of Klondike.\n\nHer belief in the positive benefits of the British Empire infused her writing. As a correspondent for \"The Times\", Shaw sent back \"Letters\" in 1892 and 1893 from her travels in South Africa and Australia, later published in book form as \"Letters from South Africa\" (1893). Writing for the educated governing circles, she focused on the prospects of economic growth and the political consolidation of self-governing colonies within an increasingly-united empire, with a vision largely blinkered to the force of colonial nationalisms and local self-identities.\n\nThe lengthy articles in a leading daily newspaper reveal a late-Victorian metropolitan imagery of colonial space and time. Shaw projected vast empty spaces awaiting energetic English settlers and economic enterprise. Observing new landscapes from a rail carriage, for example, she selected images which served as powerful metaphors of time and motion in the construction of racial identities.\n\nWhen she first started writing for \"The Times\", she wrote under the name of \"F. Shaw\" to try to disguise that she was a woman. Later, she was so highly regarded that she wrote openly as Flora Shaw. Her pseudonym is now little-known, and she was regarded as one of the greatest journalists of her time, specialising in politics and economics.\n\nShaw first took advantage of a journalistic opportunity while she was staying with family friends, the Younghusbands, in Gibraltar in 1886. There, over four months, she visited Zebehr Pasha, a slaver and former Sudanese governor, who was incarcerated there. Her reports purportedly led to his release.\n\nFlora was required to testify before the House of Commons Select Committee on British South Africa during the controversy on the Jameson Raid into the Transvaal on 29 December 1895. The prominent journalist had corresponded frequently with those involved or suspected of involvement, including Cecil Rhodes, Leander Starr Jameson, Colonel Francis Rhodes, and Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. She was exonerated from all charges.\n\nIn an essay that first appeared in \"The Times\" on 8 January 1897, by \"Miss Shaw\", she suggested the name \"Nigeria\" for the British Protectorate on the Niger River. In her essay, Shaw made the case for a shorter term that would be used for the \"agglomeration of pagan and Mahomedan States\" to replace the official title, \"Royal Niger Company Territories\". She thought that the term \"Royal Niger Company Territories\" was too long to be used as a name of a Real Estate Property, under the Trading Company in that part of Africa. She was in search of a new name, and she coined \"Nigeria\", in preference to terms, such as \"Central Sudan\", which were associated with the area by some geographers and travellers.\n\nShe thought that the term \"Sudan\" was associated with a territory in the Nile basin, the current Sudan. In \"The Times\" of 8 January 1897, she wrote: \"The name Nigeria applying to no other part of Africa may without offence to any neighbours be accepted as co-extensive with the territories over which the Royal Niger Company has extended British influence, and may serve to differentiate them equally from the colonies of Lagos and the Niger Protectorate on the coast and from the French territories of the Upper Niger.\"\n\nShaw was close to the three men who most epitomised empire in Africa: Rhodes, George Taubman Goldie and Sir Frederick Lugard.\nShe married, on 10 June 1902, Lugard, who, in 1928, was created Baron Lugard. She accompanied him when he served as Governor of Hong Kong (1907–1912) and Governor-General of Nigeria (1914–1919). They had no children.\n\nIn 1905, Shaw wrote what remains the definitive history of Western Sudan and the modern settlement of Northern Nigeria, \"A Tropical Dependency: An Outline of the Ancient History of the Western Soudan, With an Account of the Modern Settlement of Northern Nigeria\" (London: Nisbet, 1905).\n\nWhile they lived in Hong Kong she helped her husband establishing the University of Hong Kong. During the First World War, she was prominent in the founding of the War Refugees Committee, which dealt with the problem of the refugees from Belgium, and she founded the Lady Lugard Hospitality Committee. In the 1918 New Year Honours, she was appointed as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nShe died of pneumonia on 25 January 1929, aged 76, in Surrey.\n"}

The horse is likewise galloping free.\nTrick riding is NOT the same as equestrian vaulting which is an internationally recognized competitive sport, governed by the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI).\n\nHorse riding stunts have been performed in many films, as well as in equestrian events such as Equitana and the official opening of the Australian Equine and Livestock Events Centre, rodeos, and much more.\n\nHorse riding stunts were also performed on the musical theatre production of \"\"\"\". The trick riders for the show included Deborah Brennan and Zelie Bullen (née Thompson) (who has also taken part in other horse shows such as Equitana).\n\nTrick riding has a very interesting story. It has not always been an American entertainment act. It was once used as a weapon for the Ukrainian Cossacks who adopted it from the people of Caucasus and called it dzhigitovka. Cossacks were nearly unconquerable because they could easily hide from their enemies. When communism overtook Russia, the Cossacks were forced to leave the country. Many moved to America, where they used their talents for money. They became part of the entertainment community and soon Americans started catching on. Trick riding even became a rodeo event where the hardest tricks earned the most points. Trick riding as a competitive rodeo event came to an end in the 1940s. Trick riding became more dangerous and the horses became a lot faster as the trick riders became desperate for the prize money. Rodeo producers deemed trick riding too dangerous for competition and trick riding then became a specialty act in rodeos.\nTrick riders such as Shirley Lucas and Sharon Lucas became famous horse stunt women doubling for many movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, Lana Turner, and many more. In films, stunt riders have included Hank Durnew and Ken Maynard (1895–1973).\n\nRex Rossi was a World Champion Trick Rider in 1950 and 1961, World Champion Trick Roper 1971, and Hall of Fame Movie Stunt Man, a career that spanned 60 years. Rossi performed horse and falling stunts in Bonanza, Gunsmoke, and many western movies. He also stunt doubled for Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Jeff Bridges, Roy Rogers, and Bob Steele. Rossi trick rode at Madison Square Garden for 19 consecutive years. His Veach Trick Riding saddle is on display at the Gene Autry Cowboy Museum in Los Angeles.\n\nThere are many horse riding stunts and many different variations of tricks, with each rider having an individual style. Tricks can be strap tricks or vault type tricks. Some tricks include the forward fender, layout fender (also known as the Indian Hideaway), one foot drag, spritz stand, shoulder stand, back drag, hippodrome, vault, reverse one foot stand, and spin the horn.\n\nOne type of trick riding is known as \"Roman riding\", and is usually performed as entertainment in rodeos, circuses and horse shows. In Roman riding, the rider stands atop a pair of horses, with one foot on each horse.\n\nRoman riding is one of the older forms of riding, and was performed during the time of the Roman Empire. As many as five horses, with the rider standing on the inner three, have been ridden and jumped abreast. As many as nine horses, three teams of three abreast, have been ridden and jumped in tandem. Tricks such as trading teams while riding, riding a pony team between the horse team and jumping six- and nine-horse tandems are also performed. Sometimes riders will change teams at the trot, dance, ride backward and twirl a baton, and even jump through fire.\n\n\n"}

After playing there for two-and-a-half seasons, Branko earned a dream move to Red Star Belgrade in December 1998.\n\nIn his four-and-a-half seasons in Belgrade, he twice helped his team win the Serbo-Montenegrin Football League, in both 1999–2000 and 2000–01, as well as the Yugoslav Cup three times in 1999, 2000 & 2002. Additionally, he marked himself out as a talented and creative midfielder with a nose for goal, all of which earned him a series of national team call-ups. Still, his single most famous moment while at Red Star came during the 2002–03 UEFA Cup Second Round versus Lazio when he scored a goal in the return leg.\n\nBošković's stellar performances at Red Star got him plenty of attention from abroad, and he moved to French giants Paris Saint-Germain during summer of 2003 but failed to get a first team place upon arrival. Following the two-year stay at PSG – spent mostly out of the first team picture – he accepted a season-long loan to play with Troyes where he spent the entire 2005–06 season. After his loan spell ended, Bošković and PSG parted ways, and he spent a six-month period training with FK Rad.\n\nIn January 2007, he signed a contract with Rapid Wien until the end of the 2006–07 season. After impressing during the second half of the 2006–07 season Bošković re-signed with the club.

Following the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt in the second half of the 16th century BCE, they fled to Sharuhen and fortified it. The armies of Pharaoh Ahmose I seized and razed the town after a three-year siege.\n\nThe destruction of Sharuhen was merely the first stage of a new policy of pre-emptive warfare waged by the Egyptians. Because the Egyptians of the 17th Dynasty felt deeply humiliated by the 15th and 16th Dynasty rule of the Hyksos (ca. 1650 BCE – ca. 1540 BCE), the Theban dynasty launched an ambitious war, led by Seqenenre Tao, against the foreign king, Apepi, to reclaim lost territory. Though his own campaign to expel the Hyksos from Egypt failed, and he himself was killed in battle, his son, Kamose, launched an attack on the Hyksos capital of Avaris.\n\nIt was his much younger brother, Ahmose I, however, who finally succeeded in capturing Avaris, razing it, and expelling the Hyksos rulers from Egypt altogether.\n\nThe profound insult of the foreign rule to the honour and integrity of Egypt could be corrected, and its recurrence prevented, only by extending Egypt's hegemony over the Asiatics to the north and east of Egypt. Ahmose I engaged in a retaliative three-year siege of Sharuhen, thereby launching an aggressive policy of pre-emptive warfare. The town fell soon after the siege, ending the power of the Hyksos. His victories was maintained by his son, Amenhotep I, then continued by Amenhotep's successor Thutmose I, who extended Egyptian influence as far as the Mitanni kingdom in the north and Mesopotamia in the east, pushing the borders of the Egyptian empire farther than ever before.\n\nSharuhen is mentioned in the bible in in the description of the allotment of the Tribe of Simeon.\n\nThe following sites, all within the same small area along the Nahal Besor and Nahal Gerar rivers, have been identified as possibly being ancient Sharuhen;\n\n"}

{"id": "2305379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305379", "title": "You Must Love Me", "text": "You Must Love Me\n\n\"You Must Love Me\" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Madonna. It was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, for the 1996 film adaptation of the musical, \"Evita\", based on the life of Argentinian leader Eva Perón. The song was released on October 27, 1996, by Warner Bros. as the lead single from the film's soundtrack. After years of not working together due to their individual projects, Webber and Rice collaborated on creating a new track for the film, with the hopes of obtaining an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. According to Webber, the song's purpose was to showcase Perón's emotional state at the time as well as her relationship with her husband Juan Perón.\n\nMadonna, who starred in the title role of the film, had tried to change the lyrics of the track to create a sympathetic portrayal of Perón, but was unsuccessful. She also undertook vocal lessons to record the songs for the film. \"You Must Love Me\" features instrumentation from cello and piano which accompanies Madonna's vocals. The song garnered positive response from music critics, many of them highlighting Madonna's enhanced singing ability. It went on to win the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997.\n\nCommercially, \"You Must Love Me\" became a top-10 hit in some countries including Finland, Italy and the United Kingdom, while reaching the top-20 in the United States. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000 physical units. A music video, directed by Alan Parker, was released as promotion for the single. Madonna has performed the song at the 69th Academy Awards and on her 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour.\n\nIn 1996, Madonna starred in the film \"Evita\", playing the role of Eva Perón, the Spiritual Leader of the Nation of Argentina. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and even wrote a letter to director Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since \"Evita\" required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer \"had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. \"Evita\" is real musical theater — its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had.\"\n\n\"You Must Love Me\" was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, who had reunited for \"Evita\" after a ten-year creative separation due to their individual projects. It was written specifically for the film, so that it would contain new material and be eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Madonna noted it as her favorite song from the film, recalling that the idea for \"You Must Love Me\" grew when Parker re-arranged the ending of the film from the original play, with the hopes of reuniting Rice and Webber to create new music. According to Webber, the purpose of the song was to showcase Perón's emotional state at the time as well as her relationship with her husband Juan Perón; \"[Eva] is dying and she knows she's dying. One reason she is saying, 'You must love me', is out of desperation. She's also saying, 'You must love me because you must have always loved me', so it's a little word play, I guess, which Tim Rice has written\", he explained. It was released as the soundtrack's first official single on October 27, 1996. Since its release, the song has been included in several productions of the play, including the 2006 London production and the 2012 Broadway revival.\n\nRecording sessions for the film's songs and soundtrack began in September 1995, and took place at the CTS Studios in London; Madonna was accompanied by her co-stars Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. However, trouble arose as Madonna was not completely comfortable with laying down a \"guide vocal\" simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not have musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; \"I'm used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't [...] To work on forty-six songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment\", she recalled. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part in a more contemporary studio while the orchestration would take place somewhere else. She also had alternate days off from the recording.\n\"You Must Love Me\" starts with the sound of orchestra and piano, as Madonna sings the opening verses. She continues singing the lyrics, which talk about Perón's discovery that her husband Juan had actually loved her all along and not merely seen her as a political prop. Madonna disliked the lyrics since she wanted to portray Perón as a sympathetic figure, rather than the \"shrewd manipulator\" that Parker had in mind. She was also concerned about her own image, and was successful in getting many portions of the script altered. However, Rice declined to change the song's lyrics, but rewrote its instrumentation five or six times. He recalled, \"I remember taking the lyrics to Madonna and she was trying to change them... The scene can be interpreted in different ways, but my lyrics were kept, thank God!\"\n\nOther instrumentation for the song includes cello, which was played by a live orchestra. As the song moves towards the chorus, the piano sounds stop and the cello plays with Madonna belting out the lyrics: \"Deep in my heart, I'm concealing, Things that I'm longing to say, Scared to confess what I'm feeling, Frightened you'll slip away\", when the piano and the orchestra sounds come back again. It proceeds in the same way and gradually fades out. \"You Must Love Me\" is set in common time, with a moderate tempo of 92 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major, with Madonna's vocals spanning from G to B. The song has a basic sequence of B–E/B–F/B–B in the beginning and changes to B–F when Madonna sings the opening verse \"Where do we go from here?\".\n\n\"You Must Love Me\" received generally positive reviews from critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of \"\", wrote: \"Who can deny that her voice has remarkable and unmistakable presence when heard during 'You Must Love Me'?\". Lucy O'Brien, author of \"\", appreciated the song's addition to the soundtrack and found \"pathos\" in Madonna's vocals. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that \"Even with the faults, \"Evita\" has its merits, including the written-for-film ballad 'You Must Love Me'\". Peter Keough, from the \"Boston Phoenix\", wrote that \"['You Must Love Me'] is an aching farewell that dispels the illusion of a romance-of-convenience to reveal the inescapable love and tragedy beneath\". Teresa Huang from \"The Tech\", said it was \"a beautiful addition to an already powerful score\".\n\nLarry Flick, from \"Billboard\", called it \"a momentous musical event [...] a bittersweet and quietly theatrical ballad [written] specifically for Madonna\". Kathleen Guerdo, also from \"Billboard\", said that \"[Madonna] delivers what is by far one of the strongest vocal performances of her career, comfortably scaling to the song's demanding soprano heights while infusing it with delicate, heart-rending emotion. This bodes well for the creative potency of the rest of the soundtrack\". Matthew Jacobs from \"HuffPost\", placed it at number 61 of his list \"The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles\". He explained that \"[t]he vocal training Madonna endured for the movie pays off in this soprano serenade\", but also noted that it \"doesn't do much outside of the film\". Similar thoughts were shared by Medium's Richard LaBeau. \"Spin\"s Annie Zaleski noted that \"[Madonna's] performances on the \"Evita\" soundtrack demonstrated her astronomical growth as a vocalist\", citing \"her fragile-sounding pleas on the Oscar-winning 'You Must Love Me'\" as an example. J. D. Considine, from \"The Baltimore Sun\", said it was one of the \"big songs\" from the soundtrack.\n\nOn her review of \"Evita\", Janet Maslin from \"The New York Times\" commented that \"Mr. Lloyd Webber and Mr. Rice have contributed a lilting new song, 'You Must Love Me', that's as suitable for weddings as it is for running South American countries\". \"Entertainment Weekly\"s David Browne gave the song a rating of B and opined that \"['You Must Love Me'] is no 'Live to Tell' or 'Take a Bow'. But this simple, elegantly arranged showpiece from \"Evita\" is clearly intended to promote both the film and her new adult, matriarchal image\". Greg Kot from the \"Chicago Tribune\", called it \"among the composers' finest works--a rare example of understatement with its sparse instrumentation, brevity and nuanced lyricism\". Peter Travers from \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"sympathy-begging\". The song won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 54th ceremony, which took place on January 19, 1997. Two months later, it was awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 69th Academy Awards. While ranking Madonna's singles, in honor of her 60th birthday, \"The Guardian\"s Jude Rogers placed \"You Must Love Me\" at number 50, calling it the singer's best performance from the film and pointing out the \"emotional quaking desperation\" in her voice. Negative criticism came from the \"San Francisco Chronicle\"s Barbara Shulgasser, who wrote that \"['You Must Love Me'] didn't help a bit. Rice writes lazy, dumb lyrics that make no effort to correspond to the rhythms of the music\". Also negative was \"Slant Magazine\"s Eric Henderson, who wrote that it \"just barely misses taking the dishonor of being ranked the worst of the singles released from the soundtrack, it certainly chides that its entire mad existence was to push Andrew Lloyd Webber to an EGOT\".\n\nIn the United States, \"You Must Love Me\" was serviced to radio on October 9, 1996. It was met with a positive response, garnering 118 plays the first week, and debuting at number 55 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The CD single was released on October 29, following public demands about the song; \"Rainbow High\" from the film was added as its B-side. It debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 22 the week of November 14, 1996, ultimately peaking at number 18 after two weeks. It ranked at number 99 on the year end chart for 1997. According to \"Billboard\", \"You Must Love Me\" was Madonna's fourth highest debuting single of her career, following \"You'll See\" (number 8 in 1995), \"Erotica\" (number 13 in 1992) and \"Rescue Me\" (number 15 in 1991). It was also the highest charting Webber-Rice collaboration since Helen Reddy's rendition of \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\", which reached number 13 in 1971. It eventually received a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 22, 1998, for shipments of 500,000 copies. In Canada, the song debuted at number 36 on the \"RPM\" Top Singles chart, and reached a peak of number 11 on the week of December 16, 1996. It was present for a total of 14 weeks on the chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song reached a peak of number 10 on the UK Singles Chart the week of November 2, 1996, and was present on the top 100 for a total of 9 weeks. According to the Official Charts Company, the song had sold 90,428 copies by August 2008 in there. In Australia, \"You Must Love Me\" peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Singles Chart the week of November 10, 1996, staying on this position for one week and a total of 9 weeks on the chart. In Italy, it reached the fifth position on the \"Musica e dischi\" chart. \"You Must Love Me\" reached a peak of number 4 in Finland, and also reached a peak of number 21 on the Irish Singles Chart, where it remained for 2 weeks. In Germany, it became one of Madonna's lowest charting singles, peaking at number 78.\n\nThe music video for \"You Must Love Me\" was directed by Parker and features the singer performing the song inside a small room; interspersed with footage and scenes from \"Evita\". As Madonna was eight months pregnant with her daughter Lourdes Maria, her stomach remained hidden behind a piano. The music video was included as a bonus feature on the 15th Anniversary Edition blu-ray of the film, released on June 19, 2012. On March 24, 1997, Madonna performed the song at the 69th Academy Awards dressed in a full-length, strapless Christian Dior gown. According to choreographer Otis Sallid, they wanted to portray the singer in a restrained manner, hence the accompaniment in the stage was just a spotlight on her and a piano to her left. Writing for \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", movie critic Carrie Rickey felt Madonna \"gave a restrained performance of the number\".\n\nMadonna did not perform the song again until her Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–2009). She appeared on stage wearing a black Givenchy dress, with pink colored ribbons around her neck and black stockings on her legs and performed an acoustic, guitar-driven version of the song sitting on a stool. She was backed by 4 musicians who were dressed in gypsy clothes. As she performed the song, scenes from \"Evita\" played on the backdrop screens. The performance received positive feedback from critics with Ricardo Baca, from \"The Denver Post\", writing that \"her courageous, late-set take on 'You Must Love Me' — from the filmed version of the Broadway musical \"Evita\" — was spot-on and gorgeous with its string accompaniment\". On the Buenos Aires stop of the tour, after performing \"You Must Love Me\", Madonna also sang \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" from the film. The performances of both songs in the city were recorded in the live CD-DVD titled, \"Sticky & Sweet Tour\" (2010).\n\nIn 2007, singer Brooke White covered the song on the seventh season of \"American Idol\". She initially forgot the lyrics to the song, so had to stop after the first verse to start over from the beginning. Lana Del Rey recorded a cover of \"You Must Love Me\" in 2018 for Lloyd Webber's greatest hits album \"Unmasked: The Platinum Collection\". Del Rey commented: \"Andrew Lloyd Webber has been one of my primary inspirations in music, so to do a cover of one of his songs is a dream. I especially love...'You Must Love Me', because of how unique the melody is. I've been incredibly inspired by all of Andrew’s work from \"Phantom of the Opera\" to \"Evita\".\"\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n"}

He is most famous for his emblem books.\n\nJacob Cats was born on 10 November 1577 in Brouwershaven as son of Adriaen Cornelisz. Cats and Leenken Jacob Jansdr. Breyde. Having lost his mother at an early age, he and his three brothers were adopted by his aunt Anna Breyde, sister of his mother and his uncle Doen Leenaerts. Cats was sent to school in Breda. He then studied law in Rotterdam and Paris, and, returning to Holland, he settled in The Hague, where he began to practice as a lawyer. His pleading in defense of a person accused of witchcraft brought him many clients and some reputation. He had a serious love affair about this time, which was broken off on the very eve of marriage by his catching a tertian fever (a form of malaria) which defied all attempts at cure for some two years. For medical advice and change of air Cats went to England, where he consulted the highest authorities in vain. He returned to Zeeland to die, but was cured mysteriously with the powder of a travelling doctor (later sources claim he was a quack). He married on 26 April 1605 a lady of some wealth, Elisabeth van Valckenburg from Antwerp, and thenceforward lived at Grijpskerke in Zeeland, where he devoted himself to farming and poetry.\n\nIn 1621, on the expiration of the twelve-year truce with Spain, the breaking of the dykes drove him from his farm. He was made pensionary (stipendiary magistrate) of Middelburg; and two years afterwards of Dordrecht. In 1627 Cats came to England on a mission to Charles I, who made him a knight. In 1636 he was made Grand Pensionary of Holland, and in 1648 keeper of the great seal; in 1651 he resigned his offices, but in 1657 he was sent a second time to England on what proved to be an unsuccessful mission to Oliver Cromwell.\n\nCats retired to the seclusion of his palatial villa \"Sorghvliet\" (\"Fly From Worry\"), which was surrounded by a vast and sumptuous formal garden; the garden (now a park) became internationally famous and featured in 17th-century collections of engravings of famous European gardens. (Located near the Hague, and now known as \"Catshuis\", the house has survived and is now the official residence of the Dutch Prime Minister). Here he lived from this time till his death, occupied in the composition of his autobiography (\"Eighty-two Years of My Life\", first printed at Leiden in 1734) and of his poems. He became famous in his own lifetime from his moralistic Emblem books, most notably \"Sinne en Minnebeelden\", for which Adrian van der Venne cut the plates. He died on 12 September 1660, and was buried by torchlight, and with great ceremony, in the Kloosterkerk at the Hague. He is still spoken of as \"Father Cats\" by his countrymen.\nCats was contemporary with Hooft and Vondel and other distinguished Dutch writers in the golden age of Dutch literature, but his Orangist and Calvinistic opinions separated him from the liberal school of Amsterdam poets. He was, however, intimate with Constantijn Huygens, whose political opinions were more nearly in agreement with his own. Although hardly known outside of Holland, among his own people for nearly two centuries he enjoyed an enormous popularity – the complete collection of his poems is said to have sold around 50,000 copies, and was reputedly the only book, other than the Bible, to be found in many Dutch homes. His diffuseness and the antiquated character of his matter and diction, have, however, come to be regarded as difficulties in the way of study, and he is more renowned than read. A statue to him was erected at Brouwershaven in 1829.\n\nSee Jacob Cats, \"Alle de wercken, so ouden als nieuwe\" (complete works, old and new), published by Jan Jacobsz. Schipper, Amsterdam 1655, or: Jacob Cats, \"Complete works\" (1790–1800, 19 vols.), later editions by van Vloten (Zwolle, 1858–1866; and at Schiedam, 1869–1870): Pigott, Moral Emblems, with Aphorisms, etc., from Jacob Cats (1860); and P. C. Witsen Geijsbeek, \"Het Leven en de Verdiensten van Jacob Cats\" (1829). Southey has a very complimentary reference to Cats in his Epistle to Allan Cunningham.\n\n\nCats' moralistic poems were told and retold like nursery rhymes over several generations. Even today many of his coined phrases are still colloquialisms in everyday Dutch.\n\nMany of Cats' moral poems were set to music. A selection of these, \"Klagende Maeghden en andere liederen\", was recorded in 2008 by the Utrecht ensemble Camerata Trajectina.\n\n\n"}

It was Blondie's last album of new material until 1999's It was recorded in December 1981.\n\n\"The Hunter\", as stated in the press release, is loosely a concept album based on the theme of \"searching, hunting. or pursuing one's own Mt. Everest.\" Tracks on the album include Jimmy Destri's Motown pastiche \"Danceway\", while \"Dragonfly\" has a science-fiction theme to its lyrics about a race in space. \"The Beast\" deals with Deborah Harry's experiences of becoming a public figure: \"I am the centre of attraction, by staying off the streets\". \"English Boys\" is Harry and Chris Stein's melancholy tribute to \"those English boys who had long hair\", The Beatles, recorded the year after John Lennon's assassination in New York City, describing the innocence and idealism of the 1960s, while \"War Child\" references military conflicts in Cambodia and the Middle East. The album concludes with a cover version of Smokey Robinson's \"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game\", originally recorded by The Marvelettes in 1967. \n\nThe song \"For Your Eyes Only\" was originally written for the 1981 James Bond film of the same name. The producers of the film, however, favored a track composed by Bill Conti and Michael Leeson and asked Blondie to record that song instead. When Blondie declined, the Conti/Leeson song was passed on to Sheena Easton. Blondie opted to release their song (written by Debbie Harry and Chris Stein) on \"The Hunter\".\n\nTwo singles were released from the album, \"Island of Lost Souls\" and \"War Child\" (the latter of which was also released as a 12\" extended version). \"Danceway\" was planned for release as a single in Canada (backed with \"For Your Eyes Only\") but the single was withdrawn. Videos for \"Island of Lost Souls\" and \"English Boys\" were produced.\n\nIn the liner notes to the 2001 reissue of \"The Hunter\", producer Mike Chapman stated \"I knew that we were in a different and far less accessible artistic space. And that worried me. I could tell that things were different now, and I knew that this would be the last Blondie album.\"\n\nThe album peaked at in the UK, in Australia and in the US. Compared to Blondie's three previous albums with Mike Chapman as producer (\"Parallel Lines\", \"Eat to the Beat\" and \"Autoamerican\"), \"The Hunter\" proved to be a disappointment, both commercially and critically. Six months after its release, the band splintered. The summer \"Tracks Across America Tour '82\" was set to promote the album, but turned out to be unsuccessful. The band's European tour which was due to follow in autumn was cancelled.\n\n\"The Hunter\" was digitally remastered and reissued by Chrysalis Records UK in 1994, and again by EMI-Capitol in 2001, both times with the 12\" version of \"War Child\" as the only bonus track.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Guitar's producer, Fabor Robison, originally intended for rock and roll singer Dorsey Burnette to record the song, but was dissatisfied with the finished product.

The igneous rocks of the Vosges, and those of the Alps, Corsica, etc., and the subject of metamorphism occupied his attention. He also prepared in 1858 geological and hydrological maps of Paris, with reference to the underground water, similar maps of the \"départements\" of the Seine and Seine-et-Marne, and an agronomic map of the Seine-et-Marne (1880), in which he showed the relation that exists between the physical and chemical characters of the soil and the geological structure.\n\nHis annual \"Revue des progrès de géologie\", undertaken with the assistance (1860–1865) of Auguste Laugel and afterwards (1865–1878) of Albert de Lapparent, was carried on from 1860 to 1880. His observations on the lithology of the deposits accumulated beneath the sea were of special interest and importance. His separate publications were: \"Recherches sur l'origine des roches\" (Paris, 1865); \"Étude sur le métamorphisme des roches\" (1869), \"Lithologie des mers de France et des mers principales du globe\" (2 vols. and atlas, 1871).\n\nHe died in Paris on 24 March 1881.\n"}

Schwartz (born 1927) is a 20th-century American artist considered a pioneer of computer-mediated art and one of the first artists notable for basing almost her entire oeuvre on computational media. Many of her ground-breaking projects were done in the 1960s and 1970s, well before the desktop computer revolution made computer hardware and software widely available to artists.\n\nAs a young girl during the Great Depression, Schwartz experimented with slate, mud, sticks, and chalk as free materials for making art. She studied to become a nurse under a World War II education program and later on found her training in anatomy, biology, and the use of plaster valuable in making art. Stationed in Japan during the postwar occupation in an area between Hiroshima and Nagasaki, she contracted polio, which paralyzed her for a time. As part of her rehabilitation, she studied calligraphy with the artist Tshiro.\n\nAfter her return to the United States, she continued to experiment with media, including metal and plastic sculpture. In this period, she had to have surgery for a thyroid tumor, possibly from exposure to plastic solvents.\n\nBy 1966, Schwartz had begun working with light boxes and mechanical devices like pumps, and she became a member of the Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.) group that brought together artists and engineers as collaborators. In 1968 her kinetic sculpture \"Proxima Centauri\" was included in the important early show of machine art at the New York Museum of Modern Art entitled \"The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age.\" This sculpture was later used as a special effect for a \"Star Trek\" episode, in which it served as a prison for Spock's brain.\n\nSchwartz was brought into Bell Labs in 1968 by Leon Harmon. While there, she worked with engineers John Vollaro and others, including extensive collaboration with Ken Knowlton, a software engineer and computer artist who had also had work in the 1968 Museum of Modern Art show. That collaboration produced a series of computer-animated films, each built from the output of visual generative algorithms written by Knowlton and edited by Schwartz. She took classes in programming at The New School for Social Research around that same time. She began making paintings and films with a combination of hand painting, digital collaging, computer and other image processing, and optical post-processing, initially working with Knowlton's 1963 computer graphics language, BEFLIX, his subsequent graphics language EXPLOR and also SYMBOLICS. By 1975, Schwartz and Knowlton, in collaboration, had made ten of the first digitally created computer-animated films to be exhibited as works of fine art: \"Pixillation, Olympiad, UFOs, Enigma, Googolplex, Apotheosis, Affinities, Kinesis, Alae \"and\" Metamorphosis.\n\nWhile those 10 films did not yet involve the digital editing of images or image sequences, Schwartz having edited them as physical film the conventional way, in her work of subsequent periods, Schwartz's creative cobbling together of different, often cutting-edge technologies has been said to prefigure what would later become common practice in such programs as Photoshop and Final Cut Pro.\n\nSchwartz has contributed to scientific research on color perception and sound. She had been a consultant at AT&T Bell Laboratories, IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Laboratory, Exxon Research Center and Lucent Technologies Bell Labs Innovations.\n\nSchwartz used the works of Leonardo da Vinci extensively in experiments with computers. One notable work she created is \"Mona/Leo\", for which she compared the image of a Leonardo da Vinci self-portrait with the \"Mona Lisa\", matching the two faces feature by feature to show their underlying structural similarity. Specifically, she replaced the right side of the \"Mona Lisa\" with the flipped left side of a red chalk self-portrait of Leonardo. Superimposed lines drawn on the image showing the close alignments of the bottom of the eye, eyebrow, nose and chin prompted her to argue that the Mona Lisa is in part a cryptic self-portrait of the artist. In further experiments along these lines, she removed the gray tones in Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait and superimposed the \"Mona Lisa\" eye over it. Not everyone is convinced by her argument for the identity of Leonardo da Vinci and the \"Mona Lisa\"; one common counter-argument is that the similarities are due to both portraits having been created by the same person and therefore bearing the hallmarks of a characteristic style. Additionally, though the drawing on which Schwartz based the comparison is held to be a self-portrait, there is no firm historical evidence to support this theory.\n\nIn a similar experiment, Schwartz used a custom ray-tracing program to investigate the perspective anomalies in the drawing of da Vinci's fresco painting of the \"Last Supper\". Her 3D computer-generated model showed that the perspective lines in the \"Last Supper\" do match up with (extend) the architecture of the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan where the fresco is located, but only because of certain changes Leonardo made to standard linear perspective.\n\nSchwartz has been called a pioneer in \"establishing computers as a valid and fruitful artistic medium\" by physicist and Nobel laureate Arno Penzias and a trailblazer and virtuoso by the philosopher-artist Timothy Binkley. Her films have been included in the Venice Biennale and the Cannes Film Festival, among many others, and have received numerous awards. Among these is an Academy Award with Ed Emshwiller in 1980 for special effects on the film \"The Lathe of Heaven\". In the 1980s, a computer-generated TV spot that she created for the newly renovated Museum of Modern Art in New York won an Emmy Award.\n\nSchwartz's artworks have been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Moderna Museet (Stockholm), Centre Beauborg (Paris), Stedlijk Museum of Art (Amsterdam), the Grand Palais Museum (Paris), and at numerous galleries and festivals worldwide. Schwartz has been a visiting member of the Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland; an adjunct professor at the Kean College, Fine Arts Department; an adjunct professor at Rutger's Visual Arts Department; an adjunct professor at the Psychology Department, School of Arts and Sciences, New York University; and a Member of the Graduate Faculty of The School of Visual Arts, NYC. She has also been an Artist in Residence at Channel 13, WNET, New York. She has been a fellow of the World Academy of Science and Art since 1988.\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of a few Metropolitans who dared openly to contradict royal authority, and it is widely believed that the Tsar had him murdered on that account. He is venerated as a saint and martyr in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nHe was born Feodor Stepanovich Kolychev into one of the noblest boyar families of Muscovy, in the city of Galich (in present-day Kostroma Oblast). However, according to some sources, he was born in Moscow. Grand Prince Vasili III took young Theodore into the royal court. It is said that since childhood Theodore was on friendly terms with Ivan IV of Russia (\"Ivan the Terrible\"). \n\nAccording to other accounts, he was involved in the conspiracy of Prince Andrey of Staritsa against Elena Glinskaya and, when their plans were discovered, he escaped to Solovetsky Monastery on the White Sea. Yet another account says that his decision to become a monk occurred on Sunday, June 5, 1537, while he was standing in church for the Divine Liturgy, on hearing the words of Jesus: \"No man can serve two masters\" (). According to this account, he secretly left Moscow dressed as a \"muzhik\" (peasant), and for a while he hid himself away from the world in the village of Khizna, near Lake Onega, earning his livelihood as a shepherd, later joining the monastery at Solovetsk. At any rate, he entered the monastery at Solovki at the age of 30, and a year and a half later he was tonsured (took monastic vows), receiving the religious name of Philip. In the monastery he worked at the iron forge and as a baker.\n\nEleven years later, Philip was made hegumen (abbot) of the monastery. During his term in office, they constructed two cathedrals, a brick-yard, many water-mills and storehouses, and a network of canals connecting 72 lakes. It is said that Philip took part in all these toils together with other monks. As a result, the monastery experienced a spiritual revival. He also adopted a new monastic Rule (Typicon) for the community. Most of Philip's projects in Solovki survive to this day.\n\nThe tsar heard about the indefatigable monk and asked him to fill the vacant metropolitan see of Moscow. Philip agreed on condition that Ivan would abolish Oprichnina. On June 25, 1566 Philip was consecrated a bishop and enthroned as Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia.\n\nAfter only two years, however, Ivan the Terrible persisted with committing murders under the aegis of Oprichnina. During Great Lent, on the Sunday of the Veneration of the Cross, March 2, 1568, when the Tsar came to the cathedral for Divine Liturgy, Philip refused to bless him and publicly rebuked him for the ongoing massacre. The Massacre of Novgorod ensued, and Philip's condemnation followed.\n\nIvan eventually deposed Philip from office by raising incredible charges of sorcery and dissolute living. Philip was arrested during Liturgy at the Cathedral of Dormition and imprisoned in a dingy cell of the Theophany (Bogoiavlenskii) Monastery, fettered with chains, with a heavy collar around his neck, and was deprived of food for a few days in succession. Then he was transferred and immured at the Monastery of the Fathers (Otroch Monastery) at Tver. In November 1568, the tsar summoned the Holy Synod, which had Philip deposed. A year later, on December 23, 1569, he was strangled by the Tsar's minion, Malyuta Skuratov at Otroch, two days before Christmas. As if aware of his approaching death, Philip had asked to receive Holy Communion three days earlier.\n\nAfter his martyrdom, monks from Solovki Monastery asked for permission to transfer the body of St. Philip to their monastery. When they opened up the tomb they found the body of the hierarch was incorrupt, and various healings began to be reported. The transfer of his remains from Tver to the Solovki Monastery took place in 1590.\n\nIn 1652, Patriarch Nikon persuaded Tsar Alexis to bring Philip's relics to Moscow, where he was glorified (proclaimed a saint) later that same year. His memory is celebrated three times a year: \n\n\n\n"}

The Supreme Court was from 1976 made up of the High Court of Justice (High Court) and the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 1 July 1997, the Supreme Court became the High Court which is made up of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court was established in 1844 after Hong Kong became a British Crown colony under the Treaty of Nanjing. The first sitting of the court was on 1 October 1844 presided over by the first Chief Justice, John Walter Hulme.\n\nFor almost 70 years after establishment of the court, there was no Court of Appeal in Hong Kong. Appeals were either by way or re-hearing or direct to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. From 1913, appeals were heard by a Full Court made up of 3 judges. From 1913 to 1943, a judge of the British Supreme Court for China in Shanghai was eligible to sit on the Full Court. In the 1910s and 1920s, a Shanghai judge would regularly travel to Hong Kong to sit on the Full Court.

W. Norton & Company. First published in 1962, it has gone through ten editions; as of 2006 there are over eight million copies in print, making it the publisher's best-selling anthology. M. H. Abrams, a critic and scholar of Romanticism, served as General Editor for its first seven editions, before handing the job to Stephen Greenblatt, a Shakespeare scholar and Harvard professor. The anthology provides an overview of poetry, drama, prose fiction, essays, and letters from \"Beowulf\" to the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nThe first edition of \"The Norton Anthology of English Literature\", printed in 1962, comprised two volumes. Also printed in 1962 was a single-volume derivative edition, called \"The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Major Authors Edition\", which contained reprintings with some additions and changes including 28 of the major authors appearing in the original edition.\n\nThe eighth edition of \"The Norton Anthology of English Literature\" comprises six volumes, sold in two sets of three. The first set includes the volumes \"The Middle Ages\", \"The Sixteenth Century and The Early Seventeenth Century\", and \"Restoration and the Eighteenth Century\"; the second set includes \"The Romantic Period\", \"The Victorian Age\", and \"The Twentieth Century and After\". The writings are arranged by author, with each author presented chronologically by date of birth. Historical and biographical information is provided in a series of headnotes for each author and in introductions for each of the time periods.\n\nWithin this structure, the anthology incorporates a number of thematically linked \"clusters\" of texts pertaining to significant contemporary concerns. For example, \"The Sixteenth Century and The Early Seventeenth Century\" contains four such clusters under the headings, \"Literature of The Sacred\", \"The Wider World\", \"The Science of Self and World\", and \"Voices of the War\". The first of these includes four contemporary English translations of an identical passage from the Bible, those of William Tyndale, the Geneva Bible, the Douay-Rheims Version, and the Authorized (King James) Version; selections from the writings of influential Protestant thinkers of the period, including Tyndale, John Calvin, Anne Askew, John Foxe and Richard Hooker; as well as selections from the \"Book of Common Prayer\" and the \"Book of Homilies\".\n\nThe eighth edition was also sold in two volumes, which simply compressed six eras into two larger volumes, or three eras in one volume. Volume 1 comprised the selection of literature from \"'The Middle Ages\" to the \"English Restoration and the Eighteenth Century\", while Volume 2 included the selection of literature from \"The Romantic Period\" to \"The Twentieth Century and After\".\n\nAnother option was the \"Major Authors\" edition. Compressed into the single volume was a selection of major authors of each period, from the anonymous author of \"Beowulf\" to J. M. Coetzee.\n\nThe ninth edition continues to be sold in the same format as the eighth edition.\n\nThe tenth edition of the anthology went on sale in June 2018 and has continued to be sold in the same format as its two prior editions, while including a host of new writers into its already largely encompassing range.\n\nPublished in 1962, the first edition of \"Norton Anthology\" was based on an English literature survey course Abrams and fellow editor David Daiches taught at Cornell University. The anthology underwent periodic revisions every few years. The fifth edition in 1986 included the addition of the full texts of James Joyce's \"The Dead\" and Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\". The sixth edition, published in 1993, included Nadine Gordimer and Fleur Adcock. The seventh edition added Seamus Heaney's translation of \"Beowulf\", Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\", and Chinua Achebe's novel \"Things Fall Apart\".\n\nGreenblatt joined the editorial team during the 1990s: \"When Norton asked Greenblatt—who was already editor of 'The Norton Shakespeare'—to join the team as Abrams's deputy in the mid-90s, Abrams said he was initially skeptical because of their different critical approaches, but quickly came around. The two had first met in the 80s, when they once delivered opposing lectures. 'It was great fun,' Abrams said. 'He always claimed that I bent his sword. I always claimed he had the better, not of the argument, but of the rhetoric of the argument.'\" Another addition has been an increase in women writers: \"The new edition, Greenblatt said, includes 68 women writers, more than eight times as many as in the first edition.\"\n\nThe ninth edition was released in 2012, marking 50 years of the anthology's existence.\n\nThe 1970s saw the emergence of \"The Oxford Anthology of English Literature,\"; its editorial team included leading scholars Harold Bloom, Frank Kermode, and Lionel Trilling. It was discontinued. Bloom, a former student of Abrams', noted: \"We were defeated in battle.\"\n\n\"The Longman Anthology of British Literature\" is also a competitor. Of this relationship, Joyce Jensen of \"The New York Times\" wrote in 1999, \"The first stone in the war between Longman and W. W. Norton, the David and Goliath of the anthology publishing world, has been cast. With the recent publication of \"The Longman Anthology of British Literature,\" Longman has mounted a challenge to Norton to become the literary anthology of choice in colleges and universities around the country.\" \"Longman Anthology\" editor David Damrosch commented on the seventh edition of \"The Norton Anthology\", arguing:\n\n\"The Norton Anthology\" responded that:\n\nIndependent Canadian publisher Broadview Press also offers a six-volume anthology of British literature that competes with the Norton and Longman anthologies, and a two-volume Concise Edition that competes with Norton's two-volume Major Authors Edition and Longman's two-volume \"Masters of British Literature\". The editorial team for \"The Broadview Anthology of British Literature\" includes leading scholars such as Kate Flint, Jerome J. McGann, and Anne Lake Prescott and has in general been very well received, though its sales have yet to match those of the competitors from the two larger publishers.\n\nIn 2006, Rachel Donadio of \"The New York Times\" stated: \"Although assailed by some for being too canonical and by others for faddishly expanding the reading list, the anthology has prevailed over the years, due in large part to the talents of Abrams, who refined the art of stuffing 13 centuries of literature into 6,000-odd pages of wispy cigarette paper.\"\n\nSarah A. Kelen summarizes the changes to the \"NAEL\" inclusions of medieval literature through successive editions, demonstrating the way the \"Anthology\" contents reflect contemporary scholarship.\n\nSean Shesgreen, an English professor at Northern Illinois University, published a critical history of the anthology in the Winter 2009 issue of \"Critical Inquiry\", based on interviews with Abrams and examinations of the editor's \"NAEL\" files. Norton president Drake McFeely forcefully denounced the article in a January 23, 2009 story in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\".\n\n"}

The song managed to top the \"Billboard\" R&B Best Sellers in the US and peak at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It was received positively by music critics and included on several lists of the best songs during the time it was released.\n\nIt has been covered by numerous artists from various musical genres, most notably by Peggy Lee, whose 1958 rendition became the most widely known version of \"Fever\" and the singer's signature song. Lee's version contained rewritten lyrics different from the original and an altered music arrangement. It became a top-five hit on the music charts in the UK and Australia in addition to entering the top ten in the US and the Netherlands. \"Fever\" was nominated in three categories at the 1st Annual Grammy Awards in 1959, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nOther notable cover versions of \"Fever\" include those by Elvis Presley, Boney M., Madonna, Christina Aguilera, Michael Bublé, The McCoys, La Lupe and Beyoncé. Madonna released it as a single from her fifth studio album \"Erotica\" (1992) in March 1993 through Warner Bros. It topped the charts in Finland and the Hot Dance Club Songs in the US in addition to charting in the top 50 in many other countries. Madonna promoted \"Fever\" by filming and releasing a music video directed by Stéphane Sednaoui and performing the song on several television shows as well as her 1993 The Girlie Show World Tour. Various versions of \"Fever\" have been used in many films, plays and television shows.\nThe idea for \"Fever\" was presented to Otis Blackwell by an old friend, Eddie Cooley, who in 1956 had a hit song called \"Priscilla\". Blackwell said: \"Eddie Cooley was a friend of mine from New York and he called me up and said 'Man, I got an idea for a song called 'Fever', but I can't finish it.' I had to write it under another name because, at that time, I was still under contract to Joe Davis.\" John Davenport, the name he used, was the name of Blackwell's stepfather. Little Willie John reportedly disliked the song, but was persuaded to record it, on March 1, 1956, by King Records owner Syd Nathan and arranger and producer Henry Glover. It became the title track for his debut album, \"Fever\", released in 1956. \"Fever\" is a soul and rhythm and blues minor key opus with an arrangement consisting of low saxophones played by Ray Felder and Rufus \"Nose\" Gore and guitar by Bill Jennings. The vocal style of Willie John is similar to moaning and he is backed by finger snaps. Bill Dahl from the website AllMusic noted a contrast between the song's \"ominous\" arrangement and the vocals along with the finger snapping which \"marginally lightened the mood\".\n\n\"Fever\" was released as a single in April 1956 and became a double-sided hit along with the top-ten R&B song \"Letter from My Darling\". \"Fever\" reached number one for three weeks on the \"Billboard\" R&B Best Sellers chart in the United States, peaking at the top on July 21, 1956. It also made the pop charts, peaking at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song has sold one million copies in the US.\n\nThe song was included in Robert Christgau's \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in \"\" (1981). He later described it as a very \"fervid\" song. Bill Dahl from the website AllMusic credited \"Fever\" for winning the \"boisterous teen an across-the-board audience\" for Willie John. The writer further opined that the singer's \"sweaty case of love-rooted 'Fever' was seemingly grave, judging from his riveting intensity, yet he doesn't sound like he minds at all\". \"NME\" magazine listed \"Fever\" as the 96th best song of the 1950s. In his \"The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made\" list published in 1989, critic Dave Marsh ranked \"Fever\" at the position of 109. The song was included on the greatest hits albums \"Fever: The Best of Little Willie John\" (1993) and \"The Very Best of Little Willie John\" (2001).\n\nIn May 1958, Peggy Lee recorded a cover version of the song in Hollywood, which featured significantly rewritten lyrics composed by Lee herself without credit. \"Fever\" was not included on Lee's album \"Things Are Swingin'\" when it was first released in 1959; however it was listed as a bonus track on its 2004 reissue release. The uncopyrighted lyrics by Lee featured historical invocations (including the verses beginning \"Romeo loved Juliet,\" and \"Captain Smith and Pocahontas\") and are now generally thought of as a standard part of the song; they have been included in most subsequent covers of \"Fever\".\n\nLee's cover, most likely arranged by the singer herself (despite the official credit to conductor Jack Marshall), was a slower-tempo version than the original; it was described as being in \"torchy lounge\" mode, accompanied only by bass (played by Joe Mondragon) and a very limited drum set (played in part with fingers by Shelly Manne), while the finger snaps were provided either by the singer herself, by Howard Roberts, the guitarist for the date, who set aside his guitar for this number, or possibly even by the producer, Dave Cavanaugh. Lee's rendition was further described as \"smooth, sultry\". It is written in the key of A Minor in a medium swing tempo with 135 beats per minute; Lee's vocals span from the musical note of G to B.\n\nA writer of the website NPR deemed \"Fever\" as Lee's \"most memorable tune\" and considered it to be \"slinky and inimitable\". He went on to note that it displayed characteristics which were most remembered about the singer – \"her playful delivery, charisma and sexuality\". John Bush from the website AllMusic opined that the singer managed to excel in sounding \"sizzling\" in the song. John Fordham writing for \"The Guardian\" felt that the \"heated\" atmosphere heard on Lee's version of \"Fever\", \"has an underlying suggestion that the person raising the temperature for her right now doesn't have to be the one doing it next week\".\n\nLee's version peaked at number eight on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the US and spent a total of 12 weeks on that chart. It reached a peak of number five on the UK Singles Chart, where it first appeared on August 15, 1958. A reissue of the single charted again in 1992, appearing at number 75 and staying for only one week. Elsewhere in Europe, Lee's \"Fever\" managed to peak at number eight on January 3, 1959 on the Dutch Singles Chart in Netherlands for five consecutive weeks before falling off the chart. The song also peaked at number two on the Australian Singles Chart compiled by Kent Music Report and emerged as the twentieth best-selling single of 1958 in that country.\n\n\"Fever\" was nominated in the categories for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Female Vocal Performance at the 1st Annual Grammy Awards held in 1959. The track became Lee's signature song and her best-known work in addition to becoming her most successful hit. It was ranked at number 100 in the book and the accompanying list \"1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die\" by Robert Dimery. Joey Cohn ranked it as the tenth-best jazz vocal in a list of 50 Great Jazz Vocals on NPR.\n\nIn 1992, American singer and songwriter Madonna recorded a cover version of \"Fever\" for her fifth studio album, \"Erotica\". She served as a producer for the song along with Shep Pettibone. Madonna was in the studio putting down tracks for the album and had just recorded a song called \"Goodbye to Innocence\". She was going through the final stages of production on the song and suddenly started singing the lyrics to \"Fever\" over \"Goodbye to Innocence\". Madonna liked the way it sounded so much that she recorded it. In September 2008, Madonna's version of \"Fever\" was used in television promos for the fifth season of \"Desperate Housewives\".\n\nAccording to author Rikky Rooksby, Madonna changed the composition of the original version by adding drum rhythms, accompanied by a beatbox sound like snare drums. Removing the chord progression of the original, Madonna introduces original lyrics into the song. Instrumentation of the track includes strings, marimba and finger-pops at various intervals throughout. Rooksby noticed that Madonna sang with a distant and disembodied voice, and relegated it to the dance music accompanying the lyrics.\n\nAuthor Rikky Rooksby, described it as \"unsexy\", and called it a \"sterile track\" which is \"certainly misplaced as the second track of [\"Erotica\"]\". \"The New York Times\" editor Stephen Holden wrote that \"The album's softer moments include a silky hip-hop arrangement of 'Fever'\". \"The Baltimore Sun\" J. D. Considine praised the song as a \"sassy, house-style remake\" of the original version. He noted that when Madonna and the team of producers that worked on the album \"push beyond the expected... [it] really heats up, providing a sound that is body-conscious in the best sense of the term\", exemplifying his statements with \"Fever\". Alfred Soto of \"Stylus Magazine\" wrote that this song has its unique, idiosyncratic energy which he compared with material by Joni Mitchell from her album \"Blue\" (1971). A writer from \"Billboard\" called the song a \"house-inflected rendition\" and noted it was single-worthy. David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" criticized Madonna's voice as \"souless\": \"You and Shep sure do a bang-up job — pun intended — transforming 'Fever,' that old Peggy Lee hit, into a techno drone, but listen to the parched sound emitted from your throat on such tracks. It's cold, deadened, remote.\" \n\nJude Rogers from \"The Guardian\" called it an \"unnecessary trance-era update of pop’s most achingly simple song about sex\"; nonetheless, she placed the song at number 72 on her ranking of Madonna's singles, in honor of her 60th birthday. In August 2018, \"Billboard\" picked it as the singer's 66th greatest single; \"while most versions of this classic smolder, Madonna gets distant and detached, delivering an icy club banger that sounds less like a torch song from yesteryear and more like a soundtrack for anonymous encounters that would make Ms. Lee blush\". \"Slant Magazine\" Sal Cinquemani opined that it's \"Madonna’s vocal performance that’s the real star here [...] she may lack Peggy Lee’s command, but she exudes a detached confidence and control that is the pitch-perfect embodiment of \"Erotica\"s main thesis: love hurts\". From the \"Dallas Observer\", Hunter Hauk deemed it \"subtly soulful and custom made for Madonna's pre-vocal-lesson voice\".\n\nAlthough \"Fever\" was never officially released as a single in the United States, it managed to become a dance hit, becoming Madonna's 15th song to hit number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play. It topped the chart for the issue dated May 15, 1993 in its seventh week of ascending. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted at its peak position of number six on the UK Singles Chart on the issue dated April 3, 1993, and had sold 86,077 copies by August 2008. It peaked at number one on the Finnish Singles Chart on April 15, 1993. In Ireland it managed to enter the top ten of the Irish Singles Chart, peaking at the position of six and charting for four weeks. Elsewhere, it peaked at numbers 12 in Italy, 17 in New Zealand, 22 on the Ultratop chart of the Flanders region in Belgium, 31 in France and 51 in Australia.\n\nThe music video for \"Fever\", directed by Stéphane Sednaoui, was shot on April 10–11, 1993 at Greenwich Studios in Miami, Florida, and received its world premiere on May 11, 1993, on MTV. It has since been made commercially available on the DVD collection, \"\". The music video alternately features Madonna with a red wig and silver bodypaint in a variety of costumes dancing in front of funky, kaleidoscopic backgrounds. It showcases her posing like ancient goddesses. She is enveloped in a flame-like atmosphere and eventually burns up. According to Sednaoui, he wanted to portray the singer \"like a provocative saint, somebody that speaks out and tells the truth, and is ready to burn for it\"; he also recalled that the executives from Maverick wanted to do \"something that's not the [Madonna] we know – more pop, more disco, more club [...] that's why she went all the way, like, 'OK, let's paint'\". Charles Aaron writing for \"Spin\" magazine classified the clip as \"dub\".\n\nTo start the promotion for \"Erotica\", Madonna performed \"Fever\" and \"Bad Girl\" on \"Saturday Night Live\" in January 1993. During the 1000th \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", Madonna performed the original version of \"Fever\" accompanied by a band, wearing a black classic dress and smoking a cigarette. Madonna also performed \"Fever\" on the 1993 Girlie Show World Tour as the second song from the setlist. After \"Erotica\", the singer partially strips and proceeds to straddle and dances suggestively with two half-naked male dancers. At the end of the song, Madonna and the two backup dancers descend into a literal ring of fire. On October 8, 2015 Madonna performed an a cappella version of \"Fever\" during the Saint Paul stop of her Rebel Heart Tour. On November 25, 2019, Madonna performed an a capella version of \"Fever\" on her Madame X Tour.\n\nAmerican singer Beyoncé included her version of \"Fever\" on multiple releases. Her original recording of the song was included on the soundtrack album for the 2003 American musical dramedy film, \"The Fighting Temptations\", in which she also had a leading role. The song was also featured in the film itself, during a scene in which the character Beyoncé portrayed, named Lilly, sang the song in a nightclub while her eventual love interest Darrin (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.) watches her. Beyoncé's version was produced by Damon Elliott and was recorded by her while she was still working on the 2002 film \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\". Elliott suggested to the singer to record \"Fever\" as it was one of his favorite songs. When she got a role in \"The Fighting Temptations\", the song seemed \"perfect\" for it as stated by Elliot. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine provided a positive review for the cover, saying: \"The seductive iciness of Peggy Lee's 'Fever' is successfully transplanted with a gumbo sound and sexy Southern comfort.\"\n\nBeyoncé appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" on September 17, 2003 to promote \"The Fighting Temptations\" with a live performance of \"Fever\". In November 2003, the song was included in the set list of the singer's first headlining solo Dangerously in Love Tour. Beyoncé was backed by four male dancers dressed in white, performing a choreography with her. In a review of the show, Dave Simpson from \"The Guardian\" felt that the performance of \"Fever\" was \"a note perfect if pointless version\" of the original. In 2004, the song was included on the live album \"Live at Wembley\" which was filmed during a London concert as part of the tour. Beyoncé's original recording was additionally included on the track-listing of her first mixtape \"Speak My Mind\" released in 2005.\n\nAfter releasing her first fragrance Heat, Beyoncé re-recorded her version of \"Fever\" as promotion for the fragrance, using the song in its advertisements. The re-recorded 2010 version of the song was produced by Chink Santana and Beyoncé herself. It was released for digital download on the iTunes Store in the US on February 8, 2010. The next day, it was released in the United Kingdom. In February the following year, \"Fever\" was included on the track-listing of the extended play (EP) \"\", a limited CD released with the perfume.\n\nAs promotion for the fragrance, a TV commercial for Heat was directed by Jake Nava, who had previously worked with Beyoncé on various of her music videos. The commercial features Beyoncé in a red satin dress sweating in a steamy room while the 2010 cover version of \"Fever\" plays in the background. Throughout the clip, she is seen lying naked in the middle of a room, touching her body, dancing and leaving a trail of fire as she touches a wall. The commercial concludes with Beyoncé walking away from the camera and melting the floor with her footprints. During the end, she turns and says \"Catch the fever\", the tagline of the fragrance.\n\nIn an interview with \"Women's Wear Daily\", the singer described the sexual tone of the video stating: \"My sexiest moments are when I'm just getting out of the tub or the shower and I'm clean, so I wanted to incorporate that in the ads. The dress was this liquid-y satin. The song Fever I did years ago and always loved it. [For the commercial] I got to sing it a bit more whispery, more natural.\" The silky red dress she wears in the video has been noted for exposing partial cleavage. The commercial for the fragrance found controversy in the United Kingdom with the Advertising Standards Authority where it was banned from daytime TV rotation for its \"sexy imagery\".\n\nIn the 2007 film \"Spider-Man 3\", Peter steals the show when a jazz band in a club attempts to perform it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2305466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305466", "title": "A456 road", "text": "A456 road\n\nKnown as the Hagley Road in Birmingham, the A456 is a main road in England running between Central Birmingham and Woofferton, Shropshire, south of Ludlow. Some sections of the route, for example Edgbaston near Bearwood, are also the route of the Elan Aqueduct which carries Birmingham's water supply from the Elan Valley.\n\nMuch of the road is almost certainly medieval in origin. However, the road was laid out, essentially in its present form (except where there are modern bypasses) by a series of 18th century turnpike trusts.\n\nFrom Birmingham to Blakedown section was the responsibility of one trust established in 1753 to improve roads from the market house in Stourbridge. Blakedown was then part of Hagley, giving rise to the name for it of 'Hagley Road'. Sections of the route have had other names. For example, the 1903 Ordnance Survey map shows the name \"Beech Lane\" by Lightwoods House west of Bearwood, and the area south of Hagley Road between Lordswood Road and Wolverhampton Road is still referred to as \"Beech Lanes\"\n\nThe section from Blakedown to Bewdley Bridge represents two of the eight roads from the market house in Kidderminster that were maintained by a trust established in 1759. The turnpike road passed through Halesowen, following what is now A458 road and B4183 to Hayley Green. Halesowen was bypassed around the south of the town in the 1950s due to rising traffic levels and the growth of the town, and Manor Lane became part of A456. Then in the 1970s, the Quinton Expressway was opened to connect with M5 motorway junction 3, when the northern section of M5 was opened in the 1970s.\n\nFrom the Welsh Gate of Bewdley to Newnham Bridge, it was managed by the Bewdley Trust established in 1753. From Monksbridge (the Shropshire boundary, to Woofferton and so to Ludlow, the road was repaired by the Ludlow First Turnpike Trust of about 1751. The intervening section was handled by the Hundred House Turnpike Trust of 1753. The Hundred House at Great Witley was probably the meeting place for Doddingtree Hundred. This trust was unusual in being responsible for several roads radiating from a place that was not a town.\n\nThe A456 starts as Broad Street at the Paradise Circus junction on Queensway in the city centre, leading on to the \"Five Ways\" junction on the Middleway (A4540) in Birmingham, heading West through the Birmingham suburbs of Edgbaston and Quinton using a mixture of dual carriageway and single carriageway roads, though maintaining at least 2 lanes in each direction. Just beyond Quinton, the A458 exits towards Halesowen, while the A456 bypasses the town to the South, meeting the M5 at Junction 3. This route was completed in the 1960s, beginning with Quinton Expressway and resuming beyond the motorway junction as Manor Way (the Halesowen By-Pass). Part of the historic Staffordshire/Worcestershire border runs along the road by Lightwoods Park, and today this is the boundary between Birmingham City Council and the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell.\n\nThe road resumes its original route on the West side of Halesowen, entering Worcestershire and passing over the Clent Hills. The A491 is crossed in the village of Hagley, where the road becomes single carriageway once more, passing through the village, closely followed by the village of Blakedown. Beyond there a dual carriageway section takes the road to Kidderminster, crossing the A449, before following the town's Ring Road to the North side.\n\nNow on the West side of Kidderminster, the road passes the General Hospital before leaving the town and passing the West Midland Safari Park. The next town of Bewdley is now bypassed by a single carriageway road to the South and West, this road being completed in 1987. Just after Bewdley the A4117 road (to Cleobury Mortimer) begins at the Fingerpost junction with the A456. Continuing West, the road is entirely rural in nature, passing the Wyre Forest eventually meeting the A443 at a \"T\" junction. The road passes just to the North of Tenbury Wells, the A4112 providing access to the town, and then through the village of Little Hereford (therefore passing briefly through Herefordshire). Between Newnham Bridge and Burford the road enters Shropshire, and then enters Herefordshire for about the same distance, before entering Shropshire again at its junction with the A49. The A456 terminates shortly after on the A49 in Woofferton.\n\n\n\nThe road crosses a number of water courses along its route, both natural and man-made. Traveling eastbound, one will cross Gosford Brook, River Teme, Ledwyche Brook, Corn Brook, River Rea, River Severn, River Stour, (in both Kidderminster and Halesowen), the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, the Elan Aqueduct and the BCN Main Line, along with many other smaller streams and brooks.\n"}

Thereafter, Revolutionary France emerged as a major European power.\n\nThe first treaty, on 5 April 1795 between France and Prussia, had been under discussion since 1794. Prussia withdrew from the coalition that had been working on the impending partition of Poland and, where appropriate, withdrew its troops aligned against Austria and Russia. (See also the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.) In secret, Prussia recognized French control of the west bank of the Rhine, pending a cession by the Imperial Diet. France returned all of the lands east of the Rhine captured during the war. On the night of 6 April, the document was signed by the representatives of France and Prussia, François de Barthélemy and Karl August von Hardenberg. They were not face to face, each was in his own accommodation in Rosshof or the Markgräflerhof, and the papers were passed around by a courier. The contract that ceded the left bank of the Rhine was in a secret article, along with the promise that it would indemnify the right bank if the left bank of the Rhine should be covered in a final general peace in France. Peter Ochs drew up the Treaty and served as a mediator for a significant proportion of these financial statements.\n\nPrussia stuck to the agreement of the Treaty of Basel until 1806, when it joined the Fourth Coalition.\n\nIn the second treaty, on 22 July, Spain ceded the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola to France in exchange for keeping Gipuzkoa. The French also came at night to sign the peace treaty between France and Spain in which Spain was represented by Domingo d'Yriarte, who signed the treaty in the mansion of Ochs, the Holsteinerhof.\n\nThese treaties with Prussia and Spain had the effect of breaking the alliance between the French Republic's two main opponents of the First Coalition.\n\nOn 28 August 1795, the third treaty was completed, a peace between France and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, signed by Friedrich Sigismund Waitz von Eschen.\n\nThere was also an agreement to exchange the Austrian troops who had been captured in Belgium.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2305490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305490", "title": "Magistrates' court (England and Wales)", "text": "Magistrates' court (England and Wales)\n\nIn England and Wales, a magistrates' court is a lower court which holds trials for summary offences and preliminary hearings for more serious ones. Some civil matters are also decided here, notably family proceedings. In 2015, there were roughly 330 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, though the government was considering closing up to 57 of these. The jurisdiction of magistrates' courts and rules governing them are set out in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.\n\nAlmost all criminal proceedings start at a magistrates' court. Summary offences are smaller crimes (such as public order offences or most driving matters) that can be punished under the magistrates' courts limited sentencing powers – community sentences, fines, short custodial sentences. Indictable offences, on the other hand, are serious crimes (e.g. rape, murder); if it is found at the initial hearing of the magistrates' court that there is a case to answer, they are committed to the Crown Court, which has a much wider range of sentencing power. Either-way offences (such as theft) will ultimately fall into one of the previous categories depending on how serious the particular crime in question is (a minor theft will be dealt with in a magistrates' court; a serious theft will be dealt with in a Crown Court), although a defendant also has the right in such cases to elect for trial by jury in the Crown Court.\n\nCases are heard by a \"bench\" of three (or occasionally two) lay judges, or by a paid district judge; there is no jury at a magistrates' court.\n\nCriminal cases are usually, although not exclusively, investigated by the police and then prosecuted at the court by the Crown Prosecution Service. \n\nDefendants may hire a solicitor or barrister to represent them, often paid for by legal aid.\n\nThere are magistrates' courts in other common-law jurisdictions.\n\nThe current magistrates' courts are a continuation of the system of courts of petty session. Magistrates also previously presided in quarter sessions, but the abolition of these in 1972 removed the need for the distinction.\n\nIn London the Middlesex Justices Act 1792 created a separate system of courts presided over by magistrates, staffed with constables – based on the Bow Street Runners. These became known as police courts.\n\nIn criminal matters, magistrates’ courts (formerly known as a \"police courts\" in London, and petty sessions elsewhere) in England and Wales have been organised to deal with minor offences in a speedy manner. All criminal cases start in the magistrates' court and over 95 per cent of them will end there – only the most serious offences go to Crown Court.\n\n\"Summary offences\" are the least serious criminal offences. They include driving offences, vandalism, criminal damage of low value, low-level violent offences and being drunk and disorderly. This kind of 'lesser' criminality will be dealt with in summary proceedings at a magistrates' court, where the defendant has no right to a jury trial and no formal indictment is necessary. Both verdict and sentence are solely in the hands of district judges or magistrates.\n\nThe sentencing powers of magistrates' courts are therefore limited, usually to a maximum of six months' imprisonment. When dealing with two or more separate either-way offences, the maximum total custodial sentence is 12 months. However, should there be more than one summary only offence, the court's powers are limited to a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment, the nominal maximum sentencing powers of the magistrates' court. The maximum fine available used to be £5,000. However, this was raised by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 to allow unlimited fines from March 2015 for specified offences. There is no maximum aggregate fine (in the case of two or more offences). Some driving offences are punished by endorsement (licence points) and/or disqualification from driving for a period of time.\n\nThere are four types of sentence available to the magistrates - a discharge (either conditional or absolute); a financial penalty; a community order, which must include at least one of twelve possible conditions (such as supervision, unpaid work, curfew, treatment programmes for issues such as domestic violence or sexual offending, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, etc.); or custody (either immediately or as a suspended sentence). The majority of sentences are non-custodial. For either-way offences, if the magistrates feel that their powers of sentencing are insufficient, they can send the case up to a judge at the Crown Court, who can impose more severe sentences.\n\nOften the point is to achieve \"restorative justice\" (compensation of victims of crime) and \"reformation\" of the offenders. These alternative punishments are called \"community sentences\". A community sentence would usually consist of \"community payback\", a duty to work between 40 and 300 hours unpaid in the community. This is often complemented by some kind of \"programme or treatment\", offering a helping hand to offenders, and engaging them at the same time – ending a drug habit, coping with a mental illness, skills and qualifications for work, and more. Also, the judge (or magistrate) may issue orders with rules such as curfew, restraining orders (cannot go near their victim, for example) and many others. During serving of community sentences, similarly to suspended sentence, offenders usually will be supervised by a probation officer.\n\n\"Either way offences\" can be dealt with either by the magistrates' court or in the Crown Court. There will be a hearing to decide on venue, hearing an outline of the case from both prosecution and defence. The guideline is whether, taking the prosecution case at its most serious, the court believes that a magistrates' court has sufficient powers of sentence. If so, the case will be accepted, and a date will be held for a subsequent hearing in a magistrates' court – otherwise the case will be sent to the Crown Court, as with Indictable offences below. The maximum custodial sentence the magistrates can impose for an either-way offence is six months. However, if the offender is guilty of two or more either-way offences, the maximum aggregate sentence is twelve months. The maximum fine for an either-way offence is £5,000, and there is no maximum aggregate.\n\n\"Indictable offences\", very serious crimes, will be sent to the Crown Court. Before August 2013, this was a two part process of committal and then sending.\n\nFor all cases, including indictable ones, the magistrates will have to decide, however, if the defendant is to be released on bail or remanded into custody. In law in England and Wales, bail is automatically granted unless the court believes there is a chance the defendant will either abscond, reoffend during the bail period, or interfere with witnesses or the case in general.\n\nJuvenile justice deals with criminal offences by young people, who have reached the age of criminal liability (ten years old), but are not yet adults (have not reached 18). These cases are heard by specially trained magistrates sitting in a youth court. They have the power to impose a sentence of youth detention known as a detention and training order (DTO) for a period of up to two years.\n\nSome civil matters, including non-payment of council tax, are heard by magistrates. Family proceedings may be held before specially trained magistrates in family proceedings courts within magistrates' courts.\n\nModern magistrates’ courts are based on a centuries-old office of \"magistrate\", or \"Justice of the Peace\", so named for their responsibility for guarding the Queen's or King's peace.\n\nToday, terminological distinction is made between \"magistrates\", who handle most cases and magistrates' courts’ \"district judges\" (professional lawyers).\n\nIn magistrates' courts (including youth courts and family proceedings courts), less complex cases are judged by magistrates or \"lay judges\". (Previously the term \"lay magistrates\" has been used to distinguish them from \"professional magistrates\", now \"district judges\".) They are chosen from local citizens of good character (not previously convicted), mature personality and sound judgement. It is not their job, they are not paid, only have expenses reimbursed. Magistrates sit in adult criminal courts as \"benches\" of three (occasionally two), ideally of mixed gender, age and ethnicity.\n\nThe lead magistrate, known as the chairman, should be addressed in court as \"sir\" or \"madam\" or \"your worship\", and the magistrates collectively as 'your worships'. In writing, they are referred to as \"John Smith Esq. JP\" (for justice of the peace). The other magistrates are known as wingers. All decision making is made equally - the chairman does not carry any extra weight; they simply serve as the mouthpiece of the collective bench.\n\nLay magistracy is an ancient institution, dating in England from at least 1327, when an Act of Parliament provided that \"good and lawful men\" be appointed in every county in the land to guard the peace. \n\nDistrict judges (magistrates' courts), formerly known as a \"stipendiary magistrates\", are professional lawyers permanently employed by the Ministry of Justice. They sit alone to preside over proceedings in more serious cases, usually involving remand, and in committal hearings. To qualify for the position, a law degree and 5 years of experience are necessary. \n\nDistrict judges (MC) are referred to as \"District Judge or DJ \", in court addressed customarily \"Sir\" or \"Madam\" and addressed in correspondence with, for example, \"District Judge (Magistrates' Courts) Tuff\".\n\nMagistrates and district judges are assisted in court by the justices' clerk and their assistants, also known as legal advisers or court clerks, whose role is to ensure that procedures are adhered to and that the bench is properly directed as to the law and its powers, as well as seeing that the court's business is dealt with efficiently. The clerk's role is far more significant where lay magistrates are presiding because they are not legally trained and so require more advice on legal matters than a district judge. The clerk ought not to exert any influence upon the bench – to which the advice they provide must be neutral – but nevertheless the advice of the clerk carries considerable weight. To this end, the Practice Direction 2000 attempts to resolve issues concerning the influence of clerks over magistrates. It states that clerks should only advise on points of law and all advice should be given in open court in front of all present.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is an authority responsible for prosecuting cases (traditionally, in the name of the Queen or the King), once the police have completed their investigation. A relative novelty in English criminal proceedings, the CPS was established by the \"Prosecution of Offences Act 1985\". Since its creation in 1986, it is the principal, though not the only, body that can bring a case to a criminal court in England and Wales.\n\nA minority of cases are prosecuted by other law enforcement agencies, such as English local authorities, Welsh local authorities, the Department for Work and Pensions or the Health and Safety Executive, or private prosecutors such as the RSPCA or the BBC in its capacity as the TV licensing authority. Private individuals are also entitled to bring a private prosecution, this happens most commonly where an individual is an alleged victim of common assault and the authorities have declined to prosecute. Private prosecutors can either represent themselves, or they may instruct a solicitor or barrister to represent them.\n\nThe CPS retains a power to take over a private prosecution, under section 6(2) of the \"Prosecution of Offences Act 1985\", either to continue or discontinue it. It is, however, CPS policy to exercise this power only if the prosecution should be stopped because it does not meet the requirements of the Code for Crown Prosecutors, or there are important reasons why the prosecution should be pursued by the CPS.\n\nDefendants are entitled to represent themselves, and usually do so in minor cases such as road traffic offences, when they may not even have to attend. However, defendants may be represented by a solicitor or, less commonly, a barrister. In most magistrates' courts there will be a duty solicitor available to advise and possibly to represent any defendant who does not have his/her own solicitor.\n\nProceedings in magistrates' courts are oral and open for public – exceptions exist for the protection of victims (e.g. rape cases) and in youth courts.\n\nWhen a defendant first appears before a magistrates' court, they will do so in one of three circumstances. They will either appear on bail having been charged with an offence and compelled to attend court under penalty; in response to a summons, which requires attendance but does not, in the first instance, carry any penalty for non-attendance; or in custody, having been refused bail by the police. If the defendant is on bail, s/he must first surrender to the custody of the court.\n\nWhichever the circumstance, the first requirement is to identify him/herself to the Court. Once the Court is satisfied as to the identity of the defendant, it must consider the charges.\n\nIf the charge(s) is a summary offence, the court will generally expect a plea to be taken. If the plea is one of \"not guilty\", the Court will fix a date for trial, taking into account the number and availability of the witnesses.\n\nIn the event of a plea of guilty, the court will hear the facts of the case from the prosecution, and mitigation from the defence then consider sentence. For the most minor offences where the appropriate sentence is a fine or discharge, this will usually follow immediately after a plea of guilty. However, where the offence is more serious and may justify a community-based penalty or imprisonment, the case will usually be adjourned for the probation service to interview the defendant and prepare a pre-sentence report in which a recommendation as to the most appropriate sentence will be made. When the defendant returns to court for sentence, the Bench will consider the report along with any mitigation put forward by the defendant before passing sentence.\n\nOn each occasion that a defendant appears before the court, the issue of bail must be addressed. Defendants may be released on bail, which is an order of the court compelling a defendant's future attendance, which may have conditions attached to it where such conditions are considered necessary either to ensure the defendant's future attendance, prevent the commission of further offences, or prevent the obstruction of justice. If the Court decides that no conditions exist which could achieve these objectives, the court may remand the defendant in custody until the next hearing.\n\nWhen an either way offence is to be tried at the Crown Court, magistrates are responsible for committal to the Crown Court (a task in former times dealt with by a grand jury), which requires the court to consider whether there is a case to answer based upon statements and exhibits submitted to the court.\n\nIf the charge is an either way offence, the \"allocation\" procedure is carried out. In this procedure, the defendant must indicate what his/her plea to the charge would be. If the defendant indicates a plea of \"not guilty\", or declines to indicate a plea, the court hears an outline of the facts from the prosecution and representations from the defendant or his representative, and then determines whether the case is suitable for summary trial or not. The court will decline jurisdiction to try the case if it decides that the sentencing powers of the magistrates' court are inadequate to deal with the case.\n\nThe grand jury system, which still exists in the United States, has been abolished in England and Wales. Instead magistrates now perform the grand jury's functions of indicting those accused of offences which need to be tried by a jury and sending them to the Crown Court for trial.\n\nIn the case of offences which are indictable only, no plea is taken and the case is sent forthwith to the Crown Court.\n\nWhen dealing with either way offences, and after the defendant has indicated a plea, it is the role of the bench to decide whether the case is suitable for summary trial or whether to decline jurisdiction and send the case to the Crown Court - what is called the allocation decision. The court must have regard to both its sentencing powers and also any legal, procedural and factual complexity which may make the case unsuitable for summary trial. If the court finds the case suitable for summary trial then the defendant is asked whether he consents to trial or whether he will elect for trial in the Crown Court. If the court decides the case is not suitable for summary trial then it will send the case forthwith to the Crown Court.\n\nThere are four mechanisms under which a decision of a magistrates' court may be challenged:\n\n\n"}

Junctions on the road were largely grade separated, with pedestrians kept physically separate from vehicular traffic and most junctions allowing vehicles staying on the road to pass over or under those using the junction. It is now widely regarded as one of the classic urban planning blunders of the 20th century.\n\nAlthough seen as a revolutionary improvement when the first section opened in 1960, the 'Concrete Collar', as it became known, was viewed by council planners as an impenetrable barrier for the expansion of the city centre. In particular, it became unpopular with pedestrians, who were required to use subways at the roundabouts, an unpopular route due to fear of crime. According to the Birmingham Big City Plan published in 2011, the Ring Road has restricted open spaces, growth and economic activity. It has also made the city centre more crowded and harder to navigate.\n\nSince 1988, the city council has sought to recreate links between the city centre and the neighbouring areas, enlarging the city centre and improving the pedestrian environment across the city, with an emphasis on shifting vehicular movements out to The Ring Road. Controversially, pedestrian crossings are replacing underpasses. The A4400 still exists as the surface level road where the A38 runs in tunnels.\n\nIt was first planned by Herbert Manzoni in 1943 and an Act of Parliament permitting construction was passed in 1946. Due to financial controls, the first part of the ring road, Smallbrook Queensway, did not begin construction until 1957 and was completed in 1960. The entire ring road was opened by Elizabeth II in 1971.\n\nHowever, since the 1990s, some of Queensway has been altered in order to reverse the earlier strict separation of road and pedestrian traffic with a view to providing a more attractive environment for pedestrians, deter through traffic, and reducing the severance effects of the Inner Ring Road. A number of the altered junctions are in regeneration areas, such as Masshouse. In early 2008, the St Chads Queensway area near the St. Chad's Cathedral was modified to remove pedestrian underpasses and bring all pedestrian and car traffic back on to the traditional street level.\n\nThe road previously consisted of the following roads (anticlockwise from A38(M) approach (Aston Expressway):\n"}

Sicamous is a resort town about halfway between Calgary and Vancouver and is the eastern gateway to the Apple Country. With of shoreline, it styles itself as the houseboat capital of Canada. It has a population of 3,166.\n\nSicamous is an adaptation of a Shuswap language word meaning \"river circling mountains\".\n\nIn the 1800s, Sicamous and area was inhabited by a semi-nomadic Indigenous nation called the Secwepemc or Shuswap. They crossed the Rocky Mountains to hunt buffalo on the plains. In this area they were called the \"Schickamoos\". In 1871, a Provincial Map shows Schickamoos Narrows, which in early history was known as a \"meeting place of Indians\".\n\nIn 1864, gold was discovered on the Columbia River. Seymour Arm became a supply centre in the Big Bend Gold Rush.\n\nIn 1885, permanent settlers arrived after the driving of the Last Spike at Craigellachie, which linked Canada sea to sea. Among the first settlers in Sicamous were the families from Finland. Old Town, or Eagle Pass Landing as it is now known, became an almost instant town in 1871. It was the central supply centre for railway construction. Today it is used primarily for recreational purposes such as sledding, houseboating, hiking, swimming, and biking.\n\nLater, in the early 1900s, CPR hill became a residential development. Finlayson's store and a jail were built in 1892, adding a post office in 1904. The first school opened around 1908. In 1949 a bridge was built across the channel, previously having been just a ferry crossing. Several hotels opened. In 1890 the original Sicamous Hotel was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was operated for 8 years when in May 1898 it caught fire and burned down along with the station. In 1900 the hotel was rebuilt. The hotel was Tudor style with 75 rooms and a large elegant dining room. The dances were locally popular and well attended. In 1956 the railway ended service to the hotel and it closed. The hotel was demolished in 1964.\n\nEagle Valley, in Sicamous, became the home of many settlers. They came and farmed the land, putting up with forests, deep snow, and hordes of mosquitoes. The first newspaper in Sicamous was the \"Eagle Valley News\". It was printed for the first time on 22 October 1958; it continues today.\n\nOn January 29, 1983 the Sicamous and District Recreation Centre had its Grand Opening. The arena was built with much volunteer help and local contractors that contributed supplies. Located in the M. J. Finlayson Centennial Park the Recreation Centre has become a vibrant and essential part of Sicamous. Many civic projects followed including a skateboard park built behind the arena. \n\nUnofficially formed in 1885, Sicamous became British Columbia's 148th municipality to be incorporated on Monday, December 4, 1989 when Letters Patent were presented to Mayor-elect Gordon Mackie by Municipal Affairs Minister Lyall Hanson. Mr. Mackie served as Mayor of the District of Sicamous for 10 years.\n\nIn June 2012, the community experienced major flooding due to heavy rains and an abnormally high amount of snow melt from higher elevations nearby. Over 350 residents were evacuated, and many homes were heavily damaged. \n\n\n"}

The difference is that where a convertible often has the B-pillar, C-pillar and other bodywork removed, the cabrio-coach retains all bodywork to the top of the door frames and just replaces the roof skin with a retractable fabric panel.\n\nAn advantage of a cabrio-coach is that retaining more of the car's original structure means that structural rigidity is higher (or the vehicle weight is lower) than traditional cabriolets.\n\nIf a vehicle's roof includes metal panels as well as the soft-top, it may be considered to be a fixed-roof vehicle with a sunroof, instead of being a cabrio-coach.\n\nThis type of roof was popular in Germany in the 1930s, and was found on cars such as the Mercedes-Benz Ponton, Saab 92, Citroën 2CV, Fiat 500, GAZ-M20 Pobeda and the Fuldamobil. It is often called a \"Webasto\" since a German company of that name has been the main supplier for both factory built and aftermarket cloth car roofs since that time.\n\nA variant in which the original sedan's fixed rear glass window was retained first appeared in the 1930s, and had the advantage that it could be more easily retrofitted to an existing car; it was a factory option (although listed as a separate model) for the Volkswagen Beetle up to 1963. \n\nSome more modern cars also feature this roof style, for instance BMW Compact, Volkswagen Polo, Nissan Figaro, Isuzu Amigo, Fiat 500 (2007), Citroën C3 Plurial and Suzuki Vitara.\n"}

He expounded a theory known as ideal utilitarianism, and he was a major historian of the universities of the Middle Ages.\n\nBorn in Kensington, London, on 24 June 1858, Rashdall was the son of an Anglican priest. He was educated at Harrow and received a scholarship for New College, Oxford. After short tenures at St David's University College and University College, Durham, Rashdall was made a Fellow of first Hertford College, Oxford, then New College, Oxford, and dedicates his main work, \"The Theory of Good and Evil\" (1907), to the memory of his teachers T. H. Green and Henry Sidgwick.\n\nThe dedication is appropriate, for the particular version of utilitarianism put forward by Rashdall owes elements to both Green and Sidgwick. Whereas he holds that the concepts of good and value are logically prior to that of right, he gives right a more than instrumental significance. His idea of good owes more to Green than to the hedonistic utilitarians. \"The ideal of human life is not the mere juxtaposition of distinct goods, but a whole in which each good is made different by the presence of others.\" Rashdall has been eclipsed as a moral philosopher by G. E. Moore, who advocated similar views in his earlier work \"Principia Ethica\" (1903). Rashdall was also a Berkeleyan, believing in metaphysical idealism.\n\nHis historical study, \"The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages\", was described in the introduction to its recent reprinting as \"one of the first comparative works on the subject\" whose \"scope and breadth has assured its place as a key work in intellectual history.\"\n\nHis \"The Idea of Atonement in Christian Theology\" surveyed different approaches to the Christian doctrine of atonement, concluding with an influential defence of the \"subjective\" theory of the atonement that Rashdall attributed to both Peter Abelard and Peter Lombard. Rashdall argued that the \"objective\" view of the atonement associated with Anselm of Canterbury was inadequate, and that the most authentically Christian doctrine was that Christ's life was a demonstration of God's love so profound that Christ was willing to die rather than compromise his character. This in turn inspires believers to emulate his character and his intimacy with the Father.\n\nRashdall received the degree Doctor of Letters (DL) from New College, Oxford, in October 1901.\n\nHe was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1904 to 1907, a member of the Christian Social Union from its inception in 1890, and was an influential Anglican modernist theologian of the time, being appointed to a canonry in 1909.\n\nHe was Dean of Carlisle from 1917 to 1924, and died of cancer in Worthing on 9 February 1924.\n\n\n\n"}

Felton robbed a bank with a friend from prison and forged money in order to buy materials to create a fertilizer bomb. It is unclear what the target was to be. An attendant at a donut shop spotted a counterfeit $20 Chase tried to pass her. She alerted an off-duty Boston police officer, who then arrested Felton and Chase. Felton was sentenced to 27 years in prison in 2002 for bank robbery, conspiracy to commit bank robbery and other crimes.\n\nFelton changed his last name from Felton to Oladimu in 2008.\n\nAs of July 2016, Felton is a prisoner at United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and is scheduled to be released on January 22, 2026.\n\n"}

{"id": "2305561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305561", "title": "WVPX-TV", "text": "WVPX-TV\n\nWVPX-TV, virtual channel 23 (UHF digital channel 22), is an Ion Television owned-and-operated station serving Cleveland, Ohio, United States that is licensed to Akron. The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications), as part of a duopoly with Canton-licensed Ion Plus owned-and-operated station WDLI-TV (channel 17). The two stations share studios on Renaissance Parkway in Warrensville Heights and transmitter facilities on SR 261 in Norton, Ohio.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on June 7, 1953 as WAKR-TV (for \"AKRon\"), broadcasting from a transmitter located on the First National Tower in Akron. The station was owned by Summit Radio Corporation, the family-owned business of S. Bernard Berk, which also owned WAKR radio (1590 AM, and 97.5 FM, now WONE-FM). Summit had applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1947 for a television broadcast license to operate on VHF channel 11, the only channel allocated to Akron. However, before the license was issued, the FCC implemented a freeze on further television licenses while it undertook a study of what to do with the VHF spectrum.\n\nAfter the release of the FCC's \"Sixth Report and Order\" lifted the freeze in 1952, the Commission decided to collapse Akron and Canton into the Cleveland market. It limited the number of VHF channels in the Cleveland area to three—channels 3, 5 and 8 (changed from 4, 5 and 9) and to grant licenses to any additional stations only in the UHF spectrum; the channel 11 frequency was deleted in order to protect what would become WTOL in Toledo and WIIC-TV (now WPXI) in Pittsburgh. Summit was able to secure a license to operate on UHF channel 49.\n\nBeing a UHF television station in a predominantly VHF market was extremely difficult in the 1950s. Almost all television sets that were sold were not capable of tuning UHF stations, and special converters and antennas were required to receive a UHF broadcast signal. Even with a converter, the picture quality was marginal at best. About half of the UHF stations in the country that debuted in the 1950s failed and shut down before the end of the decade. The FCC did not require television sets to include UHF tuning capability until 1964, as part of the All-Channel Receiver Act.\n\nWAKR-TV was fortunate to obtain an affiliation with ABC, which had some problems during the early 1950s obtaining clearances for its complete schedule on its two secondary affiliates in Cleveland: WJW-TV (channel 8), which was also a DuMont affiliate; and WEWS-TV (channel 5), which was also a CBS affiliate. Additionally, Akron was at the time just beyond the reach of New Castle, Pennsylvania ABC affiliate WKST-TV (now WYTV), which did not move its tower and license to Youngstown until 1964. WAKR-TV also focused its programming on the Akron area to distinguish itself from the Cleveland stations. It boasted the only newscast that focused on Akron and Canton news, using resources shared with WAKR radio and the \"Akron Beacon Journal\" (a part-owner of the WAKR stations until the 1970s). \n\nThe going got more difficult, however, when WEWS became a full-time ABC affiliate in 1955. WAKR-TV was left with lower-rated syndicated programming (especially a large amount of country music and religious shows, aimed perhaps toward the area's large population of Southern expatriates), as most of the more popular shows went to the larger Cleveland stations. In 1961, Summit Radio declared that channel 49 had \"suffered very substantial operating losses\" from the beginning. \n\nThe situation got only marginally better after the FCC required all-channel tuning, and did not improve much more after the station moved to the stronger channel 23 in 1967. (The channel 49 allocation is now held by PBS member station WEAO.) It tried to focus on its unique local programming including its Akron-based newscasts. Then-station manager Bob Bostian stated as WAKR-TV marked its 25th anniversary in 1978, \"Our local programming is geared to giving Akron what it wants—news, advertising, announcements and local shows all about Akron\". The station struggled, however, and Summit had to rely for its profitability on its very successful AM station.\n\nThe station also suffered from overall low ratings because it operated in the shadow of the Cleveland market. Several studies indicated that even when viewers watched WAKR, they assumed they were watching WEWS, since both stations had a large amount of common programming from ABC. Furthermore, Akron was not a separate market for ratings purposes, but was only a small section of the Cleveland market. Although WAKR's overall ratings were very poor in the Cleveland market as a whole, it trounced the Cleveland stations in Akron and Canton.\n\nWhen WAKR-TV signed on, it was Akron's only network affiliate. Had even one more network station signed on around the same time, or even a network affiliate in Canton, the two cities may well have broken off from Cleveland and formed their own market. This market would have been among the top 100 markets in the country and would have probably served much of east-central and north-central Ohio, where the Cleveland stations have poor reception.\n\nAs it was, WAKR-TV was forced to compete with the Cleveland stations with the odds stacked heavily against it, especially since it was in the shadow of WEWS, one of ABC's strongest affiliates. It was also in constant jeopardy of losing its ABC affiliation. WEWS' owner, the E. W. Scripps Company, often tried to pressure ABC into pulling its affiliation from WAKR-TV, so that WEWS did not have to compete with another ABC affiliate in the same market.\n\nSummit Radio was reorganized as Group One Broadcasting in 1965. In 1986, Group One sold off its radio stations, but kept channel 23 and changed its call letters to WAKC (for \"AKron-Canton\") on November 3 of that year. In 1993 ValueVision, a company specializing in home shopping programming, bought the station. Immediately, speculation arose that the station would cancel its newscasts; however ValueVision chose to keep the station's news programs, and had rebranded WAKC as \"The North Ohio News Station,\" though the quality was uneven at best. The station then started to identify itself as serving Akron and Cleveland, but news coverage was still focused on the Akron/Canton area for the most part. With the launch of the new branding, the station expanded its 6 p.m. newscast to one hour, but dropped its weekend newscasts. In the fall of 1995, the station launched a 5 p.m. newscast called \"Your News\".\n\nFinally, in 1996, Paxson Communications—another company that specialized in home-shopping programs, though of the infomercial variety (and whose founder also launched the Home Shopping Network; although Paxson had owned a couple of major network affiliates years before, such as West Palm Beach ABC affiliate WPBF)—purchased WAKC. The station abruptly dropped all local news programming after February 26. Later that fall, the station began branding itself as \"ABC 23\", even though its affiliation with the network was set to end on December 31, 1996. For the next year-and-a-half, WAKC began carrying Paxson's infomercial service inTV (or the Infomail Television Network). The station assumed its current WVPX-TV call letters on January 13, 1998, after Paxson changed most of its stations' call letters to include \"PX\" in them. WVPX became a charter station of Paxson's new family-oriented broadcast network Pax TV when it launched on August 31, 1998 and carried the network's entire schedule, with practically no local programming.\n\nAn Akron-based newscast was briefly resurrected in June 2001 when Paxson entered into a local marketing agreement with Cleveland's NBC affiliate, WKYC-TV (channel 3), as part of an overall corporate deal between Paxson and NBC. Gannett-owned WKYC opened an Akron studio and produced nightly 6:30 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts (as \"Pax 23 News\"), featuring WKYC reporters assigned to stories in the Akron/Canton area. Weather reports were supplied by WKYC's meteorologists in that station's Cleveland studio. The newscasts were anchored by WKYC Akron bureau chief Eric Mansfield, who had been a reporter for the old WAKC newscasts from 1992 to 1994. WVPX dropped the newscasts upon Pax TV's rebranding as i: Independent Television on June 30, 2005, as Paxson had decided to discontinue its news share agreements with NBC's stations. What became \"Akron/Canton News\" migrated to a local origination channel on Time Warner Cable's Akron/Canton area system, where it aired until May 30, 2008.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn April 20, 2010, WVPX started broadcasting Ion Television programming on the station's main channel (23.1) in high definition.\n\nWVPX-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 23, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 59, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 23.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2305562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305562", "title": "Baháʼí Faith and education", "text": "Baháʼí Faith and education\n\nThe theme of education in the Baháʼí Faith is given emphasis. Its literature gives a principle of universal and compulsory education, which is identified as one of key principles alongside monotheism and the unity of humanity.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith wrote:\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings focus on promoting a moral and spiritual education, in addition to the arts, trades, sciences and professions. The emphasis on education is a means for social and national improvement. Since all Baháʼís have the duty to do work that is useful to humanity, Baháʼí education is meant to prepare Baháʼís to perform such work.\n\nOne purpose of universal compulsory education is implied in the Baháʼí Short Obligatory Prayer which states that the God's primary reason for creating humanity is so that each of us would come to know and love Him. Clearly one purpose of education would be to facilitate this process. But religious education, however critical, should not lead to division and conflict. Baháʼu'lláh writes:\n\nThis principle is most commonly applied by Baháʼís in the form of social-welfare projects and children's classes. The emphasis on education as a means for social and national improvement is shown in the following quote by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son and appointed successor of Baháʼu'lláh:\n\nThe type of education that is written about in the Baháʼí writings does not point to one particular type or method of education.\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings focus on promoting a moral and spiritual education, in addition to the arts, trades, sciences and professions.\n\nChildren, and the requirement to give them a proper education, is particularly emphasized in many of the Baháʼí writings. Children's classes have become common-place in most Baháʼí communities, and were named by the Universal House of Justice in 2001 as one of the four core activities that Baháʼís should focus on.\n\nBaháʼí individuals have created the noted book \"The Family Virtues Guide\", which is dedicated to the spiritual education of children. Its multi-religious content has brought it enough popularity to sell over 100,000 copies and to win the authors an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show. \n\nAll Baháʼís have the duty to do work that is useful to humanity. A major goal of Baháʼí education is therefore to prepare Baháʼís to perform such work.\n\nThis is by no means the only goal (as the categories above and below indicate), or even necessarily the overriding one, but Baháʼís are warned against courses of study which \"begin and end in words\":\n\nThe seventh \"Ishráq\" of Baháʼu'lláh's \"Ishráqat\" stipulates as follows:\n\nWhile there do exist a number of preliterate or non-literate cultures, Baháʼís assume the spread of literacy to be one of the signs of an \"ever-advancing civilization.\" For example, a priesthood is not needed in this era because the ability to read and write is no longer restricted to a professional class, with the masses reduced to auditors of their sacred texts.\n\nBaháʼís expect the world's governments to one day cooperate in selecting an international auxiliary language to be used in global communication. After this is done, that language, along with one's mother tongue will be taught in schools all over the world.\n\nAlthough Baháʼu'lláh rued the necessity of spending many years learning multiple languages, when only one could be selected, various authoritative writings do assume foreign languages to be included among the \"useful subjects\" which Baháʼís will probably study.\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith has not yet endeavored to describe an ideal school curriculum, though its writings assume the usefulness of a wide variety of subjects.\n\nBaháʼí writings variously allude to mathematics, science, technology, commerce, industry, the liberal arts, and religion as suitable subjects for inclusion in an educational curriculum.\n\nIn education theory, in addition to what is taught, it is also important to note how education is taught. In addition to the traditional mode of education, other forms of education exist such as alternative schools, unschooling, homeschooling, Montessori, and Waldorf education. The Baháʼí requirements for education do not necessarily reject any of these possibilities.\n\nThe father is attributed with the responsibility for every child's education and should he fail to execute his responsibility to educate his children he can be compelled and even lose his rights as father. Mothers are acknowledged as the \"first educators\" of humanity, and their responsibility is equally confirmed. Beyond this, responsibility also falls to the community as a whole, as embodied in its Baháʼí institutions:\n\nIn the unfortunate event that parents and/or their communities cannot educate all their children, Baháʼí law stipulates that girls are to be given priority over boys.\n\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote about school uniforms, cleanliness and courtesy:\n\nAmong the four core activities that Baháʼís are currently urged to focus on, supporting children's classes and engaging in a sequence of courses known as study circles has become part of the community life of Baháʼís around the world.\n\nThe most common sequence is called Ruhi (meaning: of the spirit), which was originally developed in Colombia and currently consists of 7 courses, with the themes from the Baháʼí writings of prayer, education, history, and more.\n\nThe following sequence of courses is:\n\n\nBook 8 and 9 are in development and are slated for release into the community gradually, the topics to be covered are the Covenant and the Family, respectively.\n\nThe United States has developed a set of curriculum for children's classes known as the core curriculum. \n\nAnother sequence of courses uses for education of the Baháʼí teachings is called Fundamental Verities. This sequence was developed in the United States, and is not as common as the more widely used Ruhi sequence.\n\nThe Baháʼí House of Worship is an institution alluded to in the writings of the Baháʼí Faith. In its entirety, it represents a temple for worship, hospital, university, hospice, and other humanitarian and educational structures. It will serve as the city center for future Baháʼí societies.\n\nSome of the more mature and able Baháʼí communities around the world have taken on the task of Social and Economic Development (SED) projects. These can vary from place to place depending on the needs of different areas. Some examples include programs for the free education of migrant workers, the employment of the homeless, or the support of displaced refugees. Individuals have also worked to reform educational practices in society, such as Dr. Dwight W. Allen, a Baháʼí, who co-authored \"American Schools: The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge\" with William H. Cosby, Jr in 2000; and the work of Dr. Daniel Jordan in the ANISA Educational Model. The Baháʼís of the world have set up more than 300 academic \"Baháʼí schools\" around the world.\n\nThe Baháʼí writings give a high praise for teachers, and, in the case that no personal will has been written, provide that some of a person's inheritance goes to their teachers.\n\n\n"}

The language is generally considered an isolate, however, there have been attempts to include it in the theoretical Hokan language family. There is no concrete evidence for connections to other languages.\n\nThe earliest records of the Seri language are from 1692 but the population has remained fairly isolated. Extensive work on Seri began in 1951 by Edward and Mary Beck Moser with the Summer Institute of Linguistics.\n\nThe language is viable within its community and is used freely in daily life. Exceptions include primary and secondary school, some parts of local church services, and communications with Spanish speakers outside of the Seri community. Most members of the community, including youth, are fluent in their language. However, the population of speakers is small and cultural knowledge has been dwindling since the traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle was essentially replaced in the 1930s by fixed settlements. Furthermore, many children are no longer becoming fluent in the language, for a variety of reasons (schools, internet, non-Seri friends); some children are completely monolingual in Spanish. For these reasons, Seri is listed as a vulnerable language by UNESCO.\n\n\"Serian family\" is a language family with Seri as its only living member; related languages have disappeared in the last couple of centuries. Attempts have been made to link it to the Yuman family, to the now-extinct Salinan language of California, and to the much larger hypothetical Hokan family. These hypotheses came out of a period when attempts were being made to group all of the languages of the Americas into families. In the case of Seri, however, very little evidence has ever been produced. Until such evidence is presented and evaluated, the language is most appropriately considered an isolate.\n\nThe name \"Seri\" is an exonym for this people that has been used since the first contacts with the Spaniards (sometimes written differently, as \"ceres\"). Gilg reported in 1692 that it was a Spanish name, but surely it was the name used by another group of the area to refer to the Seris. Nevertheless, modern claims that it is a Yaqui term that means something like \"people of the sand\" or an Opata term that means \"people who run fast\" are lacking in factual basis; no evidence has been presented for the former and no credible evidence has been presented for the latter.\n\nThe name used within the Seri community itself, for the language, is \"Cmiique Iitom\", which contrasts with \"Cocsar Iitom\" (\"Spanish language\") and \"Maricaana Iitom\" (\"English language\"). The expression is a noun phrase that is literally \"(that) with which a Seri person speaks\". The word \"Cmiique\" (phonetically ) is the singular noun for \"Seri person\". The word \"iitom\" is the oblique nominalization of the intransitive verb \"caaitom\" (\"talk\"), with the prefix \"i-\" (third person possessor), and the null prefix for the nominalizer with this class of root. Another similar expression that one hears occasionally for the language is \"Cmiique Iimx\", which is a similar construction based on the transitive verb \"quimx\" (\"tell\") (root = \"amx\").\n\nThe name chosen by the Seri committee for the name of the language used in the title of the recent dictionary was \"Comcaac quih Yaza\", the plural version of \"Cmiique Iitom\". It was appropriate for a project of that type although it is not a commonly used term. \"Comcaac\" (phonetically ) is the plural form of \"Cmiique\" and \"yaza\" is the plural nominalized form corresponding to \"iitom\". (\"ooza\" is the plural root, \"y-\" (with an accompanying vowel ablaut) is the nominalizer; the prefix for third person possessor elides before the \"y\". The word \"quih\" is a singular article (which combines with the plural noun to refer to the Seri community).\n\nThe language was erroneously referred to as \"Kunkaak\" as early as the beginning of the twentieth century (as in Hernández 1904), and this mistake has been repeated up to the present day by people who confuse the name of an ethnic group with the name of its language (which are often the same in Spanish and English). The lexeme \"Comcaac\" is used in the Seri language only to refer to the people.\n\nVowel length is contrastive only in stressed syllables. The low front vowels are phonetically between open-mid and near-open and have also been transcribed as .\n\nThe non-rounded vowels may be realized as diphthongs when followed by the labialized consonants , but this small phonetic detail is not written in the community-based writing system.\n\n occurs only in loanwords. occurs in loanwords and in a few native words, where it may alternate with depending on the word and the individual speaker. Other consonants may occur in recent loans, such as in \"hamiigo\" (\"friend\" from Spanish \"amigo\"), and in \"hoova\" (\"grape\" from Spanish \"uva\").\n\nThe labial fricative may be labiodental for some speakers, and the postalveolar fricative may be retroflex .\n\nIn unstressed syllables, assimilates to the place of articulation of the following consonant. This assimilation may take place over word boundaries in connected speech. When is preceded by or , it becomes a nasalized approximant and the following vowel becomes nasalized, e.g. \"cmiique\" \"person; Seri\" is pronounced or . For some speakers, word-final may become at the end of a phrase or sentence, or when said in isolation. It can be documented, by careful examination of word lists collected in the nineteenth century, that some of these phonetic rules have arisen fairly recently.\n\nSyllable structure in Seri is fairly complex. Simple syllable onsets are most common, however, syllables without onsets can occur at the beginning of a word. The language generally allows up to three consonants to occur together at the beginning of a syllable, although consonants cannot be repeated (i.e. \"tt\" or \"pp\"). It is like English in this respect, which allows three-consonant combinations like spray\" and \"acts. Unlike English, however, the specific combinations that may occur are much less restricted. For example, English allows \"spr-\" but disallows \"*ptk-,\" which Seri allows, as in ptcamn\", (\"Cortez spiny lobster\", \"Panulirus inflatus\"). Rarely, clusters of four consonants can occur: in cösxtamt, ...\", \"there were many, ...\"; in \"ipoomjc x, ...\" \"if s/he brings it, ...\", (with enclitic \"x\").\n\nThe nuclei of Seri syllables can include one, two, or three vowels. Long vowels are indicated by repetition (i.e. \"aa\" or \"ii\"). Vowel clusters may include 3 separate letters, as in the one syllable word \"kaoi\" (NOM-D-delouse). Syllables with complex nuclei must be stressed; otherwise, the stress generally occurs on the first syllable of a words root. Because of this, vowel clusters often occur in the initial syllable of a root.\n\nSimple coda do exist, however, complex coda are more common. Word-medial coda may not include more than one consonant, while word-final coda may include up to three.\n\nAffixes, which may consist of one or more consonants with no vowels, can be added before or after existing consonant clusters, thereby complicating pronunciation and syllabification. When necessary, empty vowel positions are inserted and often filled with a syllabic nasal or an \"i\" to aid in pronunciation.\n\nStress is contrastive in Seri. Although it usually falls on the first syllable of a root, there are many words where it does not, mostly nouns, as well as a small class of common verbs whose stress may fall on a prefix rather than on the root. An alternative analysis, recently proposed and with fewer exceptions, assigns stress to the penultimate syllable of the root of a word (since suffixes are never stressed and prefixes receive stress only as a result of phonological fusion with the root). This rule is also sensitive to syllable weight. A heavy final syllable in the root attracts stress. A heavy syllable is one that has a long vowel or vowel cluster or a final consonant cluster. (A single consonant in the syllable coda is typically counted as extrametrical in Seri.)\n\nConsonants following a stressed syllable are lengthened, and vowels separated from a preceding stressed vowel by a single consonant are also lengthened so that \"cootaj\" (\"ant\") is pronounced . Such allophonically lengthened vowels may be longer than the phonemically long vowels found in stressed syllables. The lengthening does not occur if the following consonant or vowel is part of a suffix (\"coo-taj\", the plural of \"coo\" (\"shovelnose guitarfish\"), is , without lengthening) if the stressed syllable consists of a long vowel and a short vowel (\"caaijoj\", a kind of manta ray, is , without lengthening), or if the stressed vowel is lengthened to indicate intensity. It also does not affect most loanwords.\n\nVerbs, nouns, and postpositions are inflected word categories in Seri.\n\nNouns inflect for plurality through suffixation. Compare 'mourning dove' and 'mourning doves'. Pluralization is very complicated; for this reason, each noun is listed in the dictionary with its plural form. Some nouns ostensibly use an infix to indicate plural: 'grasshopper', 'grasshoppers'. A few nouns have completely suppletive plural forms: 'Seri person', 'Seri people', 'thing', 'things'.\n\nKinship terms and body part nouns inflect for possessors through prefixes (with slightly different prefix sets). Compare 'your son' (of man) and 'your head'. As they are obligatorily possessed nouns, a special prefix appears when no possessor is specified, and kinship terms sometimes have additional material at the end as well. Compare 'one's son', and 'one's head'. Some nouns have an additional plural form to distinguish between singular and plural possessors: 'his/her eye', 'his/her eyes', 'their eyes'.\n\nFinite verbs obligatorily inflect for number of the subject, person of the subject, direct object and indirect object and tense/mood. For subject person and number, compare \"ihpyopánzx\" 'I ran', \"inyopánzx\" 'you (sg.) ran', \"yopanzx\" 'it ran, she ran, he ran', \"hayopáncojc\" 'we ran', \"mayopáncojc\" 'you (pl.) ran', yopáncojc 'they ran'.\n\nFor object person (which is written as a separate word in the orthography although it is really just a prefix), compare \"ma hyooho\" 'I saw you (sg.)', \"mazi hyooho\" 'I saw you (pl.)', and \"ihyóoho\" 'I saw him/her/it/them'.\n\nFor indirect object (also written as a separate word except in third person), compare \"me hyacóhot\" 'I showed it to you (sg. or pl.)', \"cohyacóhot\" 'I showed it to him/her/them'.\n\nThe verb \"tenses\" divide between medial forms and final forms, irrealis and realis: \"popánzx\" (irrealis, medial, third person) '(if) it/she/he runs', \"tpanzx\" (realis, medial, third person) '(as) it/she/he ran', \"yopánzx\" (distal realis, final, third person) 'it/she/he ran', \"impánzx\" (proximal realis, final, third person) 'it/she/he ran', \"spánxz aha\" (irrealis, final, third person) 'it/she/he will run'.\n\nA verb may also be negative and/or passive.\n\nA transitive verb may be detransitivized through a morphological operation, and causative verbs may be formed morphologically.\n\nThe postpositions of Seri inflect for the person of their complement: \"hiti\" 'on me', \"miti\" 'on you', \"iti\" 'on her/him/it'. Most of the words that have been called postpositions at one time (and some of which still are, in limited situations) are actually relational preverbs; they must occur in a position immediately before the verbal complex and are commonly not adjacent to their semantic complements. Some of these have suppletive stems to indicate a plural complement; compare \"miihax\" 'with you (sg.)' and \"miicot\" 'with you (pl.)'.\n\nThe Seri language is a head-final language. The verb typically occurs at the end of a clause (after the subject and direct object, in that order), and main clauses typically follow dependent clauses. The possessor precedes the possessum. The language does not have many true adjectives; adjective-like verbs follow the head noun in the same kind of construction and with the same kind of morphology as verbs in the language. The words that correspond to prepositions in languages like English are usually constrained to appear before the verb; in noun phrases they appear following their complement.\n\nSeri has several articles, which follow the noun.\n\nThe singular indefinite article (\"a\", \"an\") is \"zo\" before consonants, and \"z\" before vowels (it presumably is historically related to the word for \"one\", which is \"tazo\"). The plural indefinite article (roughly equivalent to \"some\") is \"pac\".\n\nThere are several different definite articles (\"the\"), depending on the position and movement of the object:\nThese articles are derived historically from nominalized forms (as appear in relative clauses in Seri) of verbs: \"quiij\" (\"that which sits\"), \"caap\" (\"that which stands\"), \"coom\" (\"that which lies\"), \"quiih\" (\"that (especially soft item like cloth) which is located\"), \"moca\" (\"that which comes\"), \"contica\" (\"that which goes\"), and \"caahca\" (\"that which is located\"; root \"-ahca\")\n\nFour simple demonstrative pronouns occur, plus a large set of compound demonstrative adjectives and pronouns. The simple demonstratives are \"tiix\" (\"that one\"), \"taax\" (\"those, that (mass)\"), \"hipíix\" (\"this one\"), and \"hizáax\" (\"these, this (mass)\").\n\nThe compound demonstratives are formed by added a deictic element to an article. Examples include \"himcop\" (\"that (standing far off)\"), \"ticop\" (\"that (standing closer)\"), \"hipcop\" (\"this (standing)\"), \"himquij\" (\"that (sitting far off)\"), \"himcom\" (\"that (lying far off)\"), etc. These compound demonstratives may be used either as adjectives (at the end of the noun phrase) or as pronouns.\n\nTwo personal nonreflexive pronouns are in common use: \"he\" (first person, \"I\", \"we\") and \"me\" (second person, \"you\" (singular or plural). These pronouns may have singular or plural referents; the difference in number is indicated in the verb stem. The reflexive pronouns are \"hisoj\" \"myself\", \"misoj\" \"yourself\", \"isoj\" \"herself, himself, itself\", \"hisolca\" \"ourselves\", \"misolca\" \"yourselves\" and \"isolca\" \"themselves\".\n\nThe Seri language has a rich basic lexicon. The usefulness of the lexicon is multiplied many times over by the use of idiomatic expressions. The expression for 'I am angry' is \"hiisax cheemt iha\", literally 'my.spirit stinks (Declarative)', for example. (The kinship terminology is among the most extensive and complicated that has been documented in the world.)\nSeri has a small number of loanwords, most ultimately from Spanish, but also from other languages such as O'odham.\n\nMany ideas are expressed not with single words, but with fixed expressions consisting of several words. For example, \"newspaper\" is \"hapaspoj cmatsj\" (literally, \"paper that tells lies\"), \"compass\" is \"ziix hant iic iihca quiya\" (literally, \"thing that knows where places are\"), and \"radio\" is \"ziix haa tiij coos\" (literally, \"thing that sitting there sings\"). This kind of phrase formation is deeply ingrained in the lexicon; it has been used in the past to create new terms for lexical items that became taboo due to the death of a person whose nickname was based on that word.\n\nSeri is written in the Latin script.\n\nThe letters B, D, G, Gü, and V occur in some loanwords.\n\nThe Seri alphabet was developed in the 1950s by Edward W. and Mary B. Moser, and later revised by a committee of Seri men and women working with Stephen Marlett. In particular:\n\nA growing body of Seri literature is being published. Some of the stories that were recorded, transcribed and published earlier are now being re-edited and published. New material is also being prepared by several writers. Essays by three Seri writers appear in the new anthology of Native American literature published by the University of Nebraska Press. The most recent literature is appearing as apps for Android phones, often with accompanying audio.\n\nThe Constitution of Mexico has been translated in its entirety into the Seri language by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas. The official name of the Constitution in Seri is .\n\nThe Seri word for \"shark\", which is \"hacat\", was chosen by ichthyologist Juan Carlos Pérez Jiménez to name a newly discovered species of smooth-hound shark in the Gulf of California (\"Mustelus hacat\").\n\n\n"}

It was completed in 1965 and at 2.375 million square feet (220,644 m²) is the largest congressional office building and the newest House office building (the only newer congressional office building is the Hart Senate Office Building, completed in 1982).\n\nRayburn was completed in early 1965 and is home to the offices of 169 Representatives. \n\nEarlier efforts to provide space for the House of Representatives had included the construction of the Cannon House Office Building and the Longworth House Office Building. In March 1955, House Speaker Sam Rayburn introduced an amendment for a third House office building, although no site had been identified, no architectural study had been done, and no plans prepared.\n\nThe area west of the Longworth Building on squares 635 and 636 was chosen, with the main entrance on Independence Avenue and garage and pedestrian entrances on South Capitol Street, C Street, and First Street Southwest. The cornerstone was laid in May 1962, and full occupancy began in February 1965.\n\nThe Architect of the Capitol, J. George Stewart, with the approval of the House Office Building Commission, selected the firm of Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson of Philadelphia to design a stripped-down classical building in architectural harmony with other Capitol Hill structures. However, while the interior design of the other House Office Buildings retains decor one would expect to see in House Office Buildings (with cherry wood paneling, brass railings, and marble floors), the Rayburn building possesses design style parallel to that of the 1960s, with chrome push bars, clocks, and elevators, and space-age fluorescent lighting fixtures.\n\nThe Capitol Subway System, an underground transportation system, connects the building to the Capitol. Pedestrian tunnels also connect the Rayburn building to the Capitol and to the Longworth House Office Building. This system allows the Rayburn building to be connected to most of the Congressional office buildings on Capitol Hill via tunnel (the Ford House Office Building is freestanding and attached to no other structures by tunnel).\n\nFor construction of the Rayburn House Office Building, the Congressional bill appropriated $2 million plus \"such additional sums as may be necessary.\" Such additional sums eventually exceeded $99 million. Congressional leaders inserted a gymnasium into the building plans, a fact that was not publicly known at the time of construction. The gym is below the sub-basement level, in a level of the underground parking garage, and according to \"The Hill\", a newspaper focused on Capitol Hill, \"features dozens of cardio machines outfitted with TV screens, an array of Cybex weightlifting machines and free weights.\"\nAlso in the third floor basement is a shooting range run by the U.S. Capitol Police and a basketball court.\n\nOn May 20, 2006 FBI agents raided the Rayburn Building office of Democratic Congressman William J. Jefferson in connection to an ongoing bribery investigation, marking the first time the FBI had raided the office of a sitting congressman. The raid led to members of both parties questioning the constitutionality of the action, and a subsequent hearing by the House Judiciary Committee. The legality of the raid was challenged in court, where a federal appeals court ruled that the FBI had violated the Speech or Debate clause of the United States Constitution by allowing the executive branch to review materials that were part of the legislative process.\n\nOn May 26, 2006, at 10:30 am local time, there were reports of the sounds of gunfire in the garage of the building. The Capitol complex was sealed off, and staff in the building were told to stay in their offices after the building was put into lockdown by the United States Capitol Police. Some parts of the lockdown were removed, though other areas remained sealed.\n\nCongressman Jim Saxton was reportedly the source of the false alarm, after he mistook construction sounds in the garage for gunfire.\n\n\n"}

Due to the effects of inflation, all but one of the films on the chart have been produced in the 21st century.\n\n Officially acknowledged figure.\n\n Officially acknowledged figure.\n\nThe productions listed here have their nominal budgets adjusted for inflation using the United States Consumer Price Index taking the year of release. Charts adjusted for inflation are usually ordered differently, because they are dependent on the inflation measure used and the original budget estimate.\n\nThe Soviet \"War and Peace\", released in four parts across 1966 and 1967, is sometimes cited as the most expensive production ever: Soviet claims stating it cost $100 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) were circulated in the American press during its showing there. However, its financial records reveal it cost slightly more than $9 million (about $50–60 million in today's money). Another notable omission is \"Metropolis\", the 1927 German film directed by Fritz Lang, often erroneously reported as having cost $200 million at the value of modern money. \"Metropolis\" cost $1.2–1.3 million at the time of its production, which would be about $ million at 2009 prices according to the German Consumer Price Index.\n\nThroughout the silent era, the cost of film-making grew steadily as films became longer and more ambitious and the techniques and equipment became more sophisticated. It is not known for certain which was the first film to cost $1 million or more to produce, and several myths have grown over time: D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916) was reputed to have cost $2 million but accounts show it cost $385,906.77, and \"A Daughter of the Gods\" (1916) was advertised as costing a million dollars but \"Variety\" estimated its true cost at $850,000. The first film that is confirmed to have had a $1 million budget is \"Foolish Wives\" (1922), with the studio taking advantage of its exorbitant price and advertising it as \"The First Real Million Dollar Picture\".\n\nThe most expensive film of the silent era was \"\" (1925), costing about $4 million—an astronomical sum in those days at twenty-five times the $160,000 average cost of an MGM feature. It is unclear which sound era production superseded it as the most expensive film, although this is commonly attributed to \"Hell's Angels\" (1930), directed by Howard Hughes; the accounts for \"Hell's Angels\" show it cost $2.8 million but Hughes publicised it as costing $4 million, selling it to the media as the most expensive film ever made up. The first film to seriously challenge the record was \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), reported to have cost about $3.9–4.25 million, although sources from the time state that \"Ben-Hur\" and—erroneously—\"Hell's Angels\" cost more. \"Ben-Hur\" was definitively displaced at the top of the chart by \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1946, meaning \"Ben-Hur\" may have held the record for 21 years.\n\nThe 1950s saw costs rapidly escalate as cinema competed with television for audiences, culminating with some hugely expensive epics in the 1960s that failed to recoup their costs. A prominent example of this trend was \"Cleopatra\" (1963), which lost money on its initial release despite being the highest-grossing film of the year. Since the 1990s, film budgets have once again seen a dramatic increase as the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) has become commonplace in big-budget features.\n\n\n"}

He acquired the title of \"Senapati\", meaning \"commander\", as a consequence of his leadership during the Mulshi satyagraha. \nIn 1977, the Indian government issued a postage stamp to commemorate him.\n\nSenapati Bapat was born in a Marathi Chitpawan family on 12 November 1880 in Parner. His family was originally from Ratnagiri. He was educated at Deccan College and then travelled to Britain on a government scholarship in order to study engineering.\n\nDuring his stay in Britain, he was associated with India House, spending a majority of his time learning bomb-making skills instead of pursuing his official studies. He became associated at this time with the Savarkar brothers, Vinayak and Ganesh. Bapat, who had considered blowing up the Houses of Parliament in London, took his skills back to India and passed them on to others.\n\nWhile in hiding after the Alipore bombing of 1908, Bapat travelled the country and discovered that the majority of the Indian population did not realize that their country was under foreign rule. At this point, his focus shifted from overthrowing the British government to educating the population. In 1912, he was arrested in connection with the bombing and was sentenced to be imprisoned. He was free by 1915, and was a \"seasoned revolutionary\", according to Richard Cashman. He had joined the staff of \"Mahratta\" and was one of several influential figures from the Poona area who were aligned with Bal Gangadhar Tilak's attempts to establish local organisations supporting the cause of Indian independence.\n\nHe re-aligned himself with Gandhi's vision of swaraj. In late 1920, following the death of Tilak and despite having been a fervent supporter of the Tilak's vision. This was a considerable shift, given his firebrand nature and willingness to use violence, but although he took the Gandhian oath of non-violence he remained willing to use force when he thought it necessary.\n\nFrom 1921, Bapat led the three-year farmers' protest (\"satyagraha\") against the construction of the Mulshi Dam by the Tata company. Ghanshyam Shah considers this to be \"the first recorded organised struggled against [forced] displacement\" caused by an irrigation project. The company had initially dug test trenches on land without obtaining permission and the farmers, who were mostly tenants, objected in fear of losing their lands. The dam was eventually constructed and thus the protest ultimately failed. Compensation for lands submersed by the dam's construction was eventually arranged but was given to the landlords rather than to the tenants. Although satyagrahas are intended to be non-violent, Bapat was jailed for vandalism of the construction project: rather than be captured for this, he turned himself in. His third jail sentence was for speaking at a public gathering held by Subhas Chandra Bose.\n\nMajor public roads in Pune and Mumbai have been named in his honour, and he featured in issue 303 of the \"Amar Chitra Katha\" comic book series in 1984. In 1977, the Government of India issued a postage stamp to commemorate him.\n\nOn 15 August 1947 — Indian Independence Day — Bapat was given the honour of raising the Indian national flag over the city of Poona for the first time.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n"}

Its mean altitude is 1,123 m and it passes beneath the \"Pointe du Fréjus\" (2,932 m) and the \"Col du Fréjus\" (2,542 m).\n\nThe Fréjus tunnel remains an important link in the connection between Rome and Paris, via Turin and Chambéry. Following the development of car and truck transportation, the Fréjus Road Tunnel was built along the same path from 1974 to 1980. A future high-speed rail tunnel to improve transit capacity between France and Italy, called the Mont d'Ambin Base Tunnel, is being planned as part of the Turin–Lyon high-speed railway project.\n\nThe initial gallery was 12.8 kilometres long, twice as much as the previously longest tunnel. Drilling started in August 1857 from Bardonecchia and in December 1857 from Modane. At construction start, both ends were in Piedmont-Sardinia, but this changed with the transfer of Savoy to France in 1860 (Treaty of Turin). On 26 December 1870, French and Italian workers shook hands as the two teams met halfway: the galleries were aligned to about 40 cm horizontally and 60 cm vertically. The tunnel opened for traffic on 17 September 1871, thus making it the oldest of the large tunnels through the Alps. The gallery was extended to its present length in 1881 with a new reinforced entrance in more stable ground on the French side.\n\nThe construction, directed by Germain Sommeiller, was scheduled to take 25 years, but was completed in only 14 years thanks to technical innovations such as pneumatic drilling machines and electrical ignition of explosive charges. In the final construction years, the use of recently invented dynamite further accelerated the tunnel's completion. The next two Alpine tunnels were built with similar techniques: The Gotthard Tunnel opened in 1882 and the Simplon Tunnel in 1906.\n\nThe tunnel was enlarged in 2010 to allow transport of container trucks on piggy-back wagons, as part of the Autoroute Ferroviaire Alpine.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1871, the Mont Cenis Pass Railway worked as a temporary link over the Mont Cenis Pass. It was closed soon after the Fréjus Railway opened.\n\nOnce Savoy became part of France, the Fréjus Tunnel became a possible invasion route from Italy to France, avoiding the difficulties of the Mont Cenis pass. Accordingly, an extraordinary amount of fortification was placed around Modane. The Fort du Replaton and the Fort du Sapey were built in the late 19th century on the heights across the valley of the Arc. In the 1930s the Maginot Line fortifications Ouvrage Saint-Gobain, Ouvrage Saint-Antoine and additional fortifications at Le Sappey were built.\n\nA blockhouse along the rail line to the east of the modern tunnel entrance has become a tourist attraction. The \"maison penchée\" (\"leaning house\") was built in 1939 to guard the tunnel entrance over an ammunition magazine connected to the tunnel by a gallery. In 1944 the retreating Germans exploded two rail wagons inside the tunnel entrance, causing the magazine to explode and blasting the blockhouse off its foundations, landing on a tilt.\n\nThe original monumental entry on the French side of the tunnel at Modane is now a minor tourist attraction, having been bypassed in 1881 in favor of a new entrance somewhat to the east in more stable ground. A steam locomotive has been placed in the old entrance, which is now located along a roadside.\n\n"}

The revolver is easily recognisable by the zig-zag grooves on the cylinder.\n\nSemi-automatic pistols were just beginning to appear when Colonel Fosbery (1832–1907) devised a revolver that cocked the hammer and rotated the cylinder by sliding the action, cylinder and barrel assembly back on the frame. The prototype was a modified Colt Single Action Army revolver. Fosbery patented his invention 16 August 1895 and further improvements were patented in June and October 1896.\n\nFosbery took his design to P. Webley & Son of Birmingham. P. Webley & Son, which merged with W.C. Scott & Sons and Richard Ellis & Son in 1897 to form the Webley & Scott Revolver and Arms Co., was the primary manufacturer of service pistols for the British Army as well as producing firearms for civilian use. Webley further developed the design and the Webley–Fosbery Automatic Revolver was introduced at the matches at Bisley of July 1900.\n\nThe revolver was initially made in .455 calibre for the British service cartridge, and later in .38 ACP. While the .455 version had a standard 6-round cylinder, the .38 high velocity (.38 Colt ACP) version had eight chambers and could be loaded by a circular full-moon clip. The .38 version had a shorter cylinder, and thus shorter recoil stroke. Some were made with the short frame in .455 calibre. A variety of modifications led to the production of 6 different models, Marks I through VI.\n\nIn civilian use, the Webley–Fosbery was popular with target-shooters. Because the trigger mechanism did not rotate the cylinder, shots were smooth and consistent, permitting rapid and accurate shooting. Walter Winans, a famous contemporary target shooter, preferred the Webley–Fosbery, and in 1902 he used it to place six shots in a two-inch bull's-eye at 12 paces in seven seconds. Using a Prideaux speedloader he was able to fire twelve shots into a three-inch bull's-eye in approximately 15 seconds.\n\nThe Webley–Fosbery was available in several standard configurations with barrel lengths of 7.5 inches, 6 in, and 4 in, and was also made to order. They could also be ordered with Metford (polygonal) rifling. The pistol could also be purchased with a single-shot .22 adapter for competitive target shooting; the cylinder was removed and it was inserted into the barrel.\n\nThough Webley viewed this weapon as an ideal sidearm for cavalry troops, the Webley–Fosbery was never adopted as an official government sidearm. At over 11 inches long and weighing some 44 ounces (1239 grammes) unloaded, the Webley–Fosbery was a heavy and unwieldy sidearm even by the standards of the day. Several models of Webley–Fosbery revolvers were produced, and the type saw limited action in the Boer Wars as well as World War I, where some privately purchased examples were carried by British officers in the .455 service chambering. Reports from the field suggested that the Webley–Fosbery, with its precisely machined recoil surfaces, was more susceptible to jamming in wartime conditions of mud and rain than comparable sidearms of the period. It has been commonly alleged that the Webley–Fosbery required a tight hold in order for the cylinder to properly cycle and cock the weapon. Another disadvantage was manual recocking. Unlike the simple technique used for ordinary revolvers, the Webley–Fosbery requires pulling the entire action-cylinder-barrel assembly back across the frame, a two-handed operation.\n\nProduction ceased in 1924, with a total production of less than 5,000. However, many revolvers remained unsold, and the model was carried in Webley's catalogues as late as 1939.\n\nIn the Dashiell Hammett book \"The Maltese Falcon\" and the 1941 Warner Bros film, Sam Spade's partner, Miles Archer, is shot and killed with a Webley–Fosbery Automatic Revolver. The revolver is shown in the film being fired when Archer is shot. Soon after, the unique cylinder is clearly visible when an investigating detective shows the revolver to Sam Spade. Sam Spade then identifies the gun as a \"Webley–Fosbery\". However, Bogart says it's a \"45 caliber, 8 shot,\" which is not correct because it would have to be a .38 caliber to be 8 shots. The 45 caliber was only 6 shots. In the original book, Sam Spade refers to it as a \"Thirty-eight, eight shot.\", so the script writer changed it, wrongly, from the original (believing Hammett had made a mistake, and it must be a .45 automatic, like those carried by Elisha Cook's character in the movie.)\n\nIn \"Zardoz\" (1974), Sean Connery's character, Zed, uses a Webley–Fosbery revolver throughout the film.\n\nIn the 2016 video game \"Battlefield 1\", one of the weapons available for use is the Webley-Fosbery revolver, called the Auto Revolver. It also appears in the 2015 video game Verdun\".\n\nIn the 2017 Anime \"Princess Principal\", the main character, Ange, uses a Webley-Fosbery. It is also used at one point by Daisuke Jigen in the \"Lupin III\" 2019 TV special \"Prison of the Past\".\n\nThe Webley–Fosbery is a recoil-operated revolver. It has three functional sections: the barrel and cylinder section, the lock and hammer action, and the frame which houses the trigger, recoil spring, grip, and safety.\n\nThe process of opening, emptying, and loading the Webley–Fosbery is identical to all other contemporary Webley revolvers. A pivoting lever on the side of the upper receiver is pressed to release the cylinder-barrel section, which tilts up and forward (\"breaks\") on a bottom-front pivot, simultaneously ejecting the contents of the cylinder chambers. Once loaded the section is tilted back to lock closed.\n\nOnce loaded the Webley–Fosbery is cocked by pressing the entire action-cylinder-barrel assembly as far back as it will go, using the free hand. An internal spring then brings the assembly to ready position.\n\nWhen the action-cylinder-barrel assembly moves back, either by hand-cocking or recoil, a pivoting lever connected to the frame cocks the hammer while a stud on the frame rides in the zig-zag grooves on the outer cylinder, revolving the next chamber part-way to ready position. When the internal spring brings the assembly forward the stud revolves the cylinder completely, and the chamber lines up with the barrel. Neither pulling the trigger nor manually cocking the hammer alone rotates the gun's cylinder; the entire assembly must be cocked to ensure that a chamber is properly lined up with the barrel.\n\nThe Webley–Fosbery is intended to be carried at full cock, ready to fire. The revolver therefore has the unusual feature of a safety catch, which is found on the left side of the frame at the top of the grip. When disengaged the safety lies horizontally along the frame; it is set by pressing it down, which cams the upper assembly slightly backwards, disconnecting the hammer from the sear. It can only be set when the pistol is cocked.\n\nIn early models, one-directional cylinder rotation was ensured by using a spring-loaded operating stud which rode cylinder grooves of varying depths. This design was found to be needlessly complex and in the later models a fixed stud rode grooves of a uniform depth, with overshoot grooves set at the angle of the zig-zag to prevent the stud from permitting the cylinder to turn backwards.\n\nAdditional improvements included removing the cylinder retaining latch from the side of the action. The latch was replaced with a spring-loaded stud in the cylinder's top strap.\n\nThe final version of the Webley–Fosbery was released in 1914. It had a shorter cylinder than on earlier models and the trigger spring and recoil lever were strengthened.\n\n\n"}

Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in tape libraries, are nearline storage, while tape cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline storage.\n\nThe nearline storage system knows on which volume (cartridge) the data resides, and usually asks a robot to retrieve it from this physical location (usually: a tape library or optical jukebox) and put it into a tape drive or optical disc drive to enable access by bringing the data it contains online. This process is not instant, but it only requires a few seconds.\n\nNearline tape and optical storage has the advantage of relatively longer lifespans compared to spinning hard drives, simply due to the storage media being idle and usually stored in protected dust-free enclosures when not in use. In a robotic tape loading system, the tape drive used for accessing data experiences the most wear and may need occasional replacement, but the tapes themselves can last for years to decades. If there are sealable access doors between the access mechanism and the media, it is possible for the idle media storage enclosure to survive fire, floods, lightning strikes, and other disasters.\n\nMAID (massive array of idle drives) systems archive data in an array of hard disk drives, with the most drives in a MAID usually stopped. The MAID system spins up each drive on demand when necessary to read (or in some cases to write) data on that drive. For a given amount of storage capacity, MAID systems have higher densities and lower power and cooling requirements than \"hot\" storage systems that keep all the disks spinning at full speed at all times.\n\nSome hard drive and storage systems vendors and suppliers use the term in reference to low-rotational speed hard drives that are built to be more reliable than generic desktop and laptop computer hard drives. They are intended to be operational continuously for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, possibly for several years.\n\nNearline hard drives may be used in personal or small business network-attached storage (NAS) systems, or as non-critical moderate-performance data storage on servers, where greater durability is required for the drive to operate continuously.\n\nBy comparison, standard hard drives are assumed to only be in operation for a few hours each day, and are not spinning when the computer is either turned off or in sleep mode. Standard hard drives may also use data caching methods that can improve single-drive performance, but would interfere with the operation of multi-drive RAID storage systems, potentially causing data loss or corruption.\n\nSpecifically the term \"nearline hard drive\" is being used to refer to high-capacity Serial ATA drives that work with Serial Attached SCSI storage devices. Presumably this usage is by analogy to the high-capacity and low-access speed tape systems.\n"}

He was a court painter to the governors of the Southern Netherlands and worked in the principal cities of Flanders where he helped spread the Rubens style.\n\nGaspar de Crayer was born in Antwerp as the son of Gaspard de Crayer the Elder, a decorative painter, illuminator and art dealer. Rather than stay in Antwerp, he looked for opportunity in the capital Brussels. He is believed to have studied under Raphael Coxie, the court painter of the governors of the Spanish Netherlands Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and Isabella Clara Eugenia. He became a master in the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1607. He was a dean of the Guild from 1611 to 1616 and was a member of the Brussels city council in 1626-1627. He remained in Brussels until 1664.\n\nGaspar de Crayer's early works include portraits of the kings of Spain and the Spanish governors and officials who were stationed in the Spanish Netherlands as well as members of the Brussels city council. For example, the \"\" (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) was painted by de Crayer in 1627-1628. In addition, from the beginning of his career de Crayer received orders for altarpieces to decorate several churches and monasteries around Brussels. Not until 1635 did Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, brother of King Philip IV of Spain and governor of the Spanish Netherlands after the death of his aunt Isabella Clara Eugenia in 1633, make him his first court painter. He later worked as a court painter for the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria who became governor in 1647.\nHe operated a large workshop which produced portraits of members of the leading classes in Brussels as well as a large number of altarpieces for churches in Flanders and abroad including Germany and Spain. He also received in 1647 a commission from Dutch architect Jacob van Campen to assist in the decoration of Huis ten Bosch, the palace of stadtholder Frederick Henry in The Hague. De Crayer also completed commissions for Spanish patrons, the largest of which was a commission for at least 17 images of saints, possibly destined for the Monastery of St Francis in Burgos. Another important foreign patron was the German Catholic ruler Maximilian Willibald of Waldburg-Wolfegg, for whom de Crayer executed several large altarpieces for the churches in the Palatinate between 1658 and 1666.\n\nEven while he gained a high social position in Brussels, de Crayer did not lose contact with his hometown Antwerp. He was in particular a friend and business associate of the art dealer Matthijs Musson (c. 1600–78), who was also his patron and arranged commissions for him. He married Catharina Janssens on 17 February 1613.\n\nHe worked regularly in Ghent where he produced altarpieces and also played a leading role in the coordination of the monumental decorations for the Joyous Entry of the Cardinal-Infante in Ghent (1635). In 1664 he finally moved to this city where he spent the last five years of his life. In spite of his age, he received numerous important orders for altarpieces. He had previously established a reputation in Ghent: before 1620 he had regularly completed commissions for various religious and secular institutions of the city. The fame of Gaspar de Crayer is demonstrated by the great role that he was given in the execution of the monumental decorations for the Joyous Entry into Ghent of Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Austria in 1635. Among the numerous paintings made in Ghent stand out the Martyrdom of St. Blas and the works that are in the Saint Bavo's Cathedral.\n\nIn his large workshop de Crayer trained between 1610 and 1661 a large number of pupils, including presumably Jan van Cleve (III), Anselm van Hulle and François Monnaville.\n\nGaspar de Crayer died on 27 January 1669 in Ghent.\n\nGaspar de Crayer mainly painted portraits of the elite and Counter Reformation altarpieces for local and foreign churches. His early work is in the trend of the 16th century tradition of Antwerp artists such as Marten de Vos and Hendrik de Clerck. Typical for this style is the unnatural perspective and the crowding of long wooden figures in the foreground. From 1618 he came under the influence of Rubens. The level of borrowing of motifs from Rubens suggests that he had some form of contract with the workshop of Rubens since some models he could only have seen there. The influence is shown in a more monumental rendering of figures in more balanced compositions. Until 1630, de Crayer followed the style of Rubens’ Classicist period. The work \"Mocking of Job\" (1619, Musée des Augustins, Toulouse) is an example of this style.\nFrom then onwards, his work was more influenced by Anthony van Dyck, whose emotionally charged interpretation of religious subjects appealed to his sensibility. His work became more dynamic in conception. He also was influenced by van Dyck's portrait series for the ‘Iconography’ (Icones Principum Virorum), a collection of portraits of leading personalities of van Dyck's time.\n\nBetween 1638 and 1648 de Crayer's compositions displayed a lighter tonality and his figures become softer and more sentimental in appearance. This may have been under the influence of the later work of Rubens. His work also showed a trace of the Venetian 16th-century masters, in particular the art of Titian and Paolo Veronese. De Crayer, however, never visited Italy and he mainly knew the work through the prints of Agostino Carracci.\n\nIn the 1650s and 1660s, de Crayer's art became more emotionally loaded and more dramatic through the deployment of a relatively large number of figures at various planes within the picture space. In the last period, a lot of work produced by his workshop surfaced and his rich and warm palette became increasingly dull.\n"}

The 2005 release of the film in the United States, by its distributor, Miramax/Buuna Vista, was subject to criticism for delay.\n\nThe film was not widely reviewed, and the published reviews were mixed. Haley Joel Osment was described by one reviewer as having an \"unusual emotional depth\" in the film, where he \"emotionally centers the film, with a balanced, thoughtful portrait\". This reviewer also correctly predicted that because the film was shot in English, with many of the actors speaking with Polish accents, it would quickly go to video and TV. David Nusair described the film as \"a fairly decent set-up that's entirely squandered by Bogayevicz, with the filmmaker's apparent inability to develop these characters beyond their most superficial attributes surely playing a key role in the movie's ultimate (and colossal) downfall.\" Reviewer John J. Puccio described the film as \"a movie that starts grimly, lightens up slightly, and then gets very gloomy, indeed.\"\n\nThe film won the award for Best Screenplay (by Yurek Bogayevicz, who also directed the film) at the 2001 Polish Film Festival. The film was also nominated for six awards at the 2002 Polish Film Awards: Best Film, Best Supporting Actress (Olga Frycz), Best Director (Yurek Bogayevicz), Best Screenplay (Yurek Bogayevicz), Best Cinematography (Paweł Edelman) and Best Costume Design (Jagna Janicka)\n\n"}
{"id": "2305746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305746", "title": "March of the Penguins", "text": "March of the Penguins\n\nMarch of the Penguins (French La Marche de l'empereur ; ) is a 2005 French feature-length nature documentary directed and co-written by Luc Jacquet, and co-produced by Bonne Pioche and the National Geographic Society. The documentary depicts the yearly journey of the emperor penguins of Antarctica. In autumn, all the penguins of breeding age (five years old and over) leave the ocean, which is their normal habitat, to walk inland to their ancestral breeding grounds. There, the penguins participate in a courtship that, if successful, results in the hatching of a chick. For the chick to survive, both parents must make multiple arduous journeys between the ocean and the breeding grounds over the ensuing months.\n\nIt took one year for the two isolated cinematographers Laurent Chalet and Jérôme Maison to shoot the documentary, which was shot around the French scientific base of Dumont d'Urville in Adélie Land.\n\n\"March of the Penguins\" was released in France on January 26, 2005 by Buena Vista International and in the United States by Warner Independent Pictures on June 24, 2005. The documentary won the 2006 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. On June 1, 2010, a home video release in France included the movie in the Disneynature collection. The documentary had a 2007 follow-up movie, \"Arctic Tale\", which only took in at the box office $1.8 million worldwide. A direct sequel titled \"\" (aka \"March of the Penguins 2: The Call\") was released in France in 2017 by Disneynature. It was released in the United States exclusively on Hulu on March 23, 2018.\n\nThe emperor penguins use a particular spot as their breeding ground because it is on ice that is solid year round with no danger of the ice becoming too soft to support the colony that exists. At the end of Antarctic summer, the breeding ground is only a few hundred meters away from the open water where the penguins can feed. However, by the end of winter, the breeding ground is over away from the nearest open water. To reach it, all the penguins of breeding age must traverse this great distance.\n\nThe penguins practice serial monogamy within each breeding season. The female lays a single egg, and the co-operation of the parents is needed if the chick is to survive. After the female lays the egg, she transfers it to the feet of the waiting male with minimal exposure to the elements, as the intense cold could kill the developing embryo. The male tends to the egg when the female returns to the sea, now even farther away, both to feed herself and to obtain extra food for feeding her chick when she returns. She has not eaten in two months and by the time she leaves the hatching area, she will have lost a third of her body weight.\n\nFor an additional two months, the males huddle together for warmth, and incubate their eggs. They endure temperatures approaching , and their only source of water is snow that falls on the breeding ground. When the chicks hatch, the males have only a small meal to feed them, and if the female does not return, they must abandon their chick and return to the sea to feed themselves. By the time they return, they have lost half their weight and have not eaten for four months. The chicks are also at risk from predatory birds such as northern giant petrels.\n\nThe mother penguins come back and feed their young, while the male penguins go all the way back to sea (70 miles) to feed themselves. This gives the mothers time to feed their young ones and bond with them. Unfortunately, a fierce storm arrives and some of the chicks perish.\n\nThe death of a chick is tragic, but it does allow the parents to return to the sea to feed for the rest of the breeding season. When a mother penguin loses its young in a fierce storm, it sometimes attempts to steal another mother's chick. When the other parent returns, it can recognize the chick only from its unique call. Many parents die on the trip, killed by exhaustion or by predators (such as the leopard seal), dooming their chicks back at the breeding ground.\n\nThe ingenious fight against starvation is a recurring theme throughout the documentary. In one scene, near-starving chicks are shown taking sustenance out of their father's throat sacs, 11th-hour nourishment in the form of a milky, protein-rich substance secreted from a sac in the father's throat to feed their chicks in the event that circumstances require.\n\nThe parents must then tend to the chick for an additional four months, shuttling back and forth to the sea to provide food for their young. As spring progresses, the trip gets progressively easier as the ice melts and the distance to the sea decreases, until finally the parents can leave the chicks to fend for themselves.\n\nThe DVD version includes a 54-minute film entitled \"Of Penguins and Men\" made by the film crew Laurent Chalet and Jérôme Mason about the filming of \"March of the Penguins\".\n\nDirector and film crew spent more than 13 months at the Dumont d'Urville Station, where the Institut polaire français Paul-Émile Victor is based. Although the penguins' meeting place, one of four in Antarctica, was known to be near, the day on which it occurs is not known, so they had to be ready every day. Fortunately, the gathering that year was huge – more than 1,200 penguins, compared with the norm of a few hundred.\n\nFor cameras to operate at −40°, they had to use film and to load all the film for the day, as it was impossible to reload outside. Because of the isolation from any film studios, remembering each shot was necessary to ensure continuity and to make sure that all the necessary sequences were finished.\n\nThe main challenge of making the documentary was the weather with temperatures between −50 and −60°C (−58 and −76°F). At dawn, the film crew would spend half an hour putting on six layers of clothes, and on some days they could not spend more than three hours outside. They worked in winds with gusts up to 125 miles per hour, \"which in some ways is worse than the cold temperatures\" according to director Jaquet.\n\nThe style of the documentary differs considerably between the original French version and some of the international versions.\n\nThe original French-language release features a first-person narrative as if the story is being told by the penguins themselves. The narration alternates between a female (Romane Bohringer) and a male (Charles Berling) narrator speaking the alternate roles of the female and male penguin, and as the chicks are born, their narration is handled by child actor Jules Sitruk. This style is mimicked in some of the international versions. For example, in the Hungarian version, actors Ákos Kőszegi, Anna Kubik, and Gábor Morvai provide the voices of the penguins, and the German version as seen in German movie theaters (and in the televised broadcast in April 2007 on channel ProSieben) uses the voices of Andrea Loewig, Thorsten Michaelis, and Adrian Kilian for the \"dubbed dialog\" of the penguins. This style of narration is also used in the Danish and Cantonese DVD versions.\n\nThe French release was handled by Buena Vista International France, a division of Disney. Disney also bidded to get US distribution rights to the film, but their bid ultimately failed; the English-language distribution rights were later acquired at the Sundance documentary festival in January 2005 by Adam Leipzig of National Geographic Films, who had forged a distribution partnership with Warner Bros. Pictures via their Warner Independent Pictures label. In contrast to the French version, their English release has a third-person narrative by a single voice, actor Morgan Freeman. Similarly, the Austrian channel ORF 1 used for their broadcast in April 2007, the alternate version available on the German \"Special Edition\" DVD which uses a documentary narration voiceover spoken by the German actor Sky Du Mont. Other releases' narrators include the Dutch version, narrated by Belgian comedian Urbanus; the Indian version, narrated in Hindi and English by Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan, is titled Penguins: A Love Story; the Polish version, narrated by Polish actor Marek Kondrat; and the Swedish version, narrated by Swedish actor Gösta Ekman. The Filipino version is narrated by actress Sharon Cuneta and translated by Chris Martinez and Eugene Evasco; it is entitled Penguin, Penguin, Paano Ka Ginawa? (English: \"Penguin, Penguin, How Were You Made?\") with the English title as the subtitle. The Filipino title is similar to that of a Philippine novel and film, \"Bata, Bata, Paano Ka Ginawa?\" (English: \"Child, Child, How Were You Made?\")\n\nAnother difference between the various international versions involves the music. The original version uses an original experimental soundtrack by electronic music composer Émilie Simon, whereas the English-language version replaces it with an instrumental score by Alex Wurman. The Hindi version happens to use the music from the French version.\n\nThe first screening of the documentary was at the Sundance Film Festival in the United States on 21 January 2005. It was released in France the next week, on 26 January, where it earned a 4-star rating from AlloCiné, and was beaten at the box office only by \"The Aviator\" during its opening week.\n\nThe original French version was released in the Canadian province of Québec. Subsequently, Warner Bros and National Geographic's English-language version was released in the rest of North America on 24 June 2005, drawing huge praise from most critics who found it both informative and charming. It has received a 94% \"fresh\" rating with the consensus \"Only the hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc\" on the website Rotten Tomatoes, which collects film reviews. The movie-going public apparently agreed with that assessment, as the documentary distinguished itself as one of the most successful documentaries of the season on a per-theatre basis: it became the second most successful documentary released in North America, after \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", grossing over $77 million in the United States and Canada (in nominal dollars, from 1982 to the present.) It grossed over $127 million worldwide. It is the only movie from Warner Independent to be rated G by the MPAA.\n\nThe documentary was released on DVD in France by Buena Vista Home Entertainment France on 26 July 2005, and in the United States by Warner Home Video on 29 November 2005. It was never released on VHS by Warner Home Video, due to A Very Long Engagement being the last VHS by Warner Independent. It however spawned a VHS in French locations, such as French Canadian regions. The DVD extras address some of the criticisms the documentary had attracted, most notably by reframing the documentary as a scientific study and adding facts to what would otherwise have been a family film. This Region 2 release featured no English audio tracks or subtitles; likewise the US DVD does not contain the French version at all.\n\nAn extra on the DVD issue was the controversial 1948 Bugs Bunny cartoon \"Frigid Hare\", in which Bugs visits the South Pole and meets a young penguin fleeing an Inuk hunter. The cartoon is not frequently seen because of its stereotypical depiction of the Inuk hunter, but it was included here uncut and uncensored. This is substituted in the American release with \"8 Ball Bunny\", likewise uncut and uncensored.\n\nIn November 2006, the documentary was adapted into a video game by DSI Games for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance platforms. It features \"Lemmings\"-like gameplay.\n\nIn 2007, a direct-to-DVD parody written and directed by Bob Saget called \"Farce of the Penguins\" was released. It is narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and features other stars providing voice-overs for the penguins. Although the film uses footage from actual nature documentaries about penguins, the parody was not allowed to include footage from \"March of the Penguins\" itself.\n\nThe documentary attracted some political and social commentary in which the penguins were viewed anthropomorphically as having similarities with, and even lessons for, human society. Michael Medved praised the documentary for promoting conservative family values by showing the value of stable parenthood. Medved's comments provoked responses by others, including Andrew Sullivan, who pointed out that the penguins are not in fact monogamous for more than one year, in reality practicing serial monogamy. Matt Walker of \"New Scientist\" pointed out that many emperor penguin \"adoptions\" of chicks are in fact kidnappings, as well as behaviours observed in other penguin species, such as ill treatment of weak chicks, prostitution, and ostracism of rare albino penguins. \"For instance, while it is true that emperor penguins often adopt each other's chicks, they do not always do so in a way the moralisers would approve of.\" Sullivan and Walker both conclude that trying to use animal behavior as an example for human behavior is a mistake.\n\nThe director, Luc Jacquet, has condemned such comparisons between penguins and humans. Asked by the \"San Diego Union Tribune\" to comment on the documentary's use as \"a metaphor for family values – the devotion to a mate, devotion to offspring, monogamy, self-denial\", Jaquet responded: \"I condemn this position. I find it intellectually dishonest to impose this viewpoint on something that's part of nature. It's amusing, but if you take the monogamy argument, from one season to the next, the divorce rate, if you will, is between 80 to 90 percent... the monogamy only lasts for the duration of one reproductive cycle. You have to let penguins be penguins and humans be humans.\"\n\nSome of the controversy over this may be media driven. Rich Lowry, editor of \"National Review\", reported in the magazine's blog that the BBC \"have been harassing me for days over \"March of the Penguins\" ... about what, I'm not sure. I think to see if I would say on air that penguins are God's instruments to pull America back from the hell-fire, or something like that. As politely as I could I told her, 'Lady, they're just birds.'\"\n\nAnother controversy involves those who feel that the emperor penguin's behavior can be viewed as an indication of intelligent design, and those who consider it to be an example of evolution by natural selection in action. Steve Jones, professor of genetics at University College London, is quoted as saying, \"Supporters of intelligent design think that if they see something they don't understand, it must be God; they fail to recognise that they themselves are part of evolution. It appeals to ignorance, which is why there is a lot of it in American politics at the moment.\" Author Susan Jacoby claims in her 2008 book, \"The Age of American Unreason\" (page 26), that the distributors of the movie deliberately avoided using the word \"evolution\" in order to avoid backlash from the American religious right, and writes, \"As it happens, the emperor penguin is literally a textbook example, cited in college-level biology courses, of evolution by means of natural selection and random mutation. ... The financial wisdom of avoiding any mention of evolution was borne out at the box office ...\"\n\n\"March of the Penguins 2: The Next Step\" () was released by Disneynature in France on February 15, 2017, with narration by Lambert Wilson. The film was alternatively titled \"March of The Penguins 2: The Call\".\n\nSkipping a theatrical release in the US, the film was released as a Hulu exclusive on March 23, 2018, with Morgan Freeman reprising his role as narrator. It was later released on DVD in the UK by Lionsgate Films on November 5.\n\nThe sequel did fairly well, scoring 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 5 reviews.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2305752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305752", "title": "The Players Club", "text": "The Players Club\n\nThe Players Club is a 1998 American dark comedy drama film written and directed by Ice Cube in his directorial debut. With Ice Cube, the film stars Bernie Mac, Monica Calhoun, Jamie Foxx, John Amos, A. J. Johnson, Alex Thomas, Charlie Murphy, Terrence Howard, Faizon Love and LisaRaye in her first starring role.\n\nThe story is presented as a memory of Diana “Diamond” Armstrong (LisaRaye) sparked by her arrival at the scene of the raunchy, dysfunctional Players Club. She explains that she used to work at the club, beginning working there after getting pregnant with her son and getting into a heated argument with her father about wanting to go to a Historically Black College or University (HBCU), prompting her to move out of her parents' home. Initially, Diana ends up working at a shoe store. There she meets Ronnie (Chrystale Wilson) and Tricks (Adele Givens), who work for Dollar Bill (Bernie Mac) at The Players Club. They convince Diana she would make better money stripping, saying, \"Use what you got to get what you want.\"\n\nDollar Bill gives Diana a job and the name Diamond. Her job initially goes well. However, four years later her younger cousin Ebony Armstrong (Monica Calhoun) comes to live with her after leaving Florida. After listening to Dollar's rendition of \"The Strippin' Game\", she starts working at the club.\n\nEbony is soon out of control - drinking excessively, staying out all night and influenced more and more by Ronnie and Tricks, who encourage Ebony to do more out-of-club parties for groups of men. Diamond tries to warn Ebony to stay away from Ronnie and Tricks and to quit doing house parties, but Ebony rebels against being told what to do and ignores Diamond's advice.\n\nAfter a heated confrontation with Ebony, Diamond has a flashback to a time when she was at a private party with Ronnie and Tricks. Diamond is passed out on the bed drunk, and the men at the party offer to pay Ronnie to perform cunnilingus on Diamond. Ronnie accepts the offer and proceeds to assault Diamond. The flashback encourages Diamond to continue to try to protect Ebony. Clyde (Alex Thomas) and Reggie (Ice Cube) - two watchmen who work for a drug lord named St. Louis - offer Ebony money to come off and have sex with them, but Diamond intervenes.\n\nMeanwhile, Dollar Bill gets confronted by a man who works for St. Louis, a drug lord and loan shark to whom Dollar Bill owes $60,000. He warns Dollar Bill if he doesn't make a payment of $10,000 to St. Louis, he will hunt him down. That same night, St. Louis comes to his club to collect. L'il Man, the doorman of the club, tells St. Louis that Dollar Bill is not at the club; St. Louis and his men leave. The next day as Dollar Bill tries to leave the club, St. Louis' men Brooklyn (Charlie Murphy) and K.C. (Terrence Howard) confront him. They beat him unconscious and throw him into the trunk of his car. Luckily for him, they are stopped by Freeman (John Amos) and Peters (Faizon Love), two crooked cops. Dollar Bill is found in the trunk and is arrested on warrants; he is later bailed out and returns to the club.\n\nThe following night rapper Luther \"Luke\" Campbell comes to the strip club, Reggie and Clyde discuss him. When Dollar Bill is notified that Luke is at his club, he alerts the strippers via a money alarm, believing he will make a fortune. All of the strippers in the club come rushing down where Luke and his crew are sitting, while Diamond chooses to stay pleasuring Miron. Shortly afterwards Diamond's professor comes in the club and notices her dancing. Embarrassed and ashamed, Diamond runs away downstairs to the locker room. Ronnie then comes in and attempts to sexually assault Diamond again but Diamond fights off her advances.Clyde attempts to meet Luke, but Luke's bodyguard (Michael Clarke Duncan) informs Clyde that Luke is trying to relax and not meet with fans. Clyde insults the bodyguard, causing him to hit Clyde in the back of his head as he starts to walk away. The bodyguard, Luke and the others in the V.I.P. section all laugh. In retaliation, Reggie grabs a chair, smashes it over the bodyguards head and beats down the bodyguard and belligerently fights against Luke and his friends, only for him to be gang-beaten and thrown into a glass window. The dazed Reggie opens fire wildly while the patrons flee before being knocked out by the bouncer X.L. (Tiny Lister). Clyde then gets up and begins throwing punches himself at the entourage. Downstairs, a panicked Tricks comes busting in yelling about the shooting upstairs stopping Ronnie from assaulting Diamond.\n\nFurther tension develops between Ebony and Diamond when Diamond returns home later that night after fleeing her obsessive customer Miron, who admitted to stalking her and then tried to force entry to her apartment, to find Ebony in bed with her now ex-boyfriend Lance (after he breaks up with Diamond earlier). Diamond loses it and lunges at Ebony. Ebony frantically flees to the bathroom and locks the door and Diamond chases Lance out with her gun, shooting at him several times. Diamond then threatens and taunts Ebony. When Diamond feigns leaving, she punches Ebony when she opens the door and throws her out of the apartment. Diamond begins to grow sick and tired of the drama with Ebony and the club. Days later, Diamond reconciles with her professor; he tells her he understands and promises to help her start her career after she graduates.\n\nDiamond then begins dating Blue (Jamie Foxx), a DJ at the Player's Club. Meanwhile, Ebony is offered a gig to dance at Ronnie's brother Junior's (Samuel Monroe Jr.) bachelor party, under the pretense from Ronnie that other girls from the club will be dancing there as well (In actuality, Ronnie lied to use her as a way out of stripping for her brother's friends at the party so Ebony can strip for them instead). When Ebony realizes that she will be the only woman in a hotel room full of horny men, she desperately tries calling Diamond (who is out on a date with Blue) to come and pick her up, but Diamond refuses, still being mad at Ebony for sleeping with Lance.\n\nMeanwhile, at Junior's party, Reggie and Clyde, both feeling insulted by Diamond and Ebony from a previous encounter (she aggressively told them she wasn't interested anymore when she first arrived to the party), tell Junior that Ebony will have sex with him, claiming that they \"ran a train\" on her. Excited, Junior bursts in on Ebony while she is changing. Ebony resists, prompting Junior to brutally beat and rape her, leaving his friends to listen to it in full disgust and disbelief. Soon, Reggie, Clyde and the other guests leave, wanting no further involvement with Junior. When Ronnie discovers Ebony unconscious, she and Junior flee the hotel room as she scolds him. Later, Diamond has a change of heart and she and Blue decide to check up on Ebony at the hotel, only to discover her bloodied and unconscious body on the bed. This proves to be the final straw for Diamond.\n\nFurious, Diamond grabs her gun and goes to the Players Club, where Ronnie and Tricks are hiding out. After scaring the other strippers away by firing a warning shot, Diamond gives the gun to Blue to cover her while she gets into a brutal fistfight with Ronnie, leaving Ronnie badly beaten. Diamond punches Tricks and this prompts Dollar Bill to firing her from the club. Diamond says final insults to Dollar and alongside with Tricks, Dollar and the others check on a beaten and bruised Ronnie and nurse her facial injuries, while Diamond and Blue leave.\n\nRonnie and Tricks are arrested by the police on charges of the rape of Ebony, and Junior had been arrested moments before. Later that night, Diamond's timing proves to be perfect when St. Louis, comes to collect. He personally shoots up the club (though he does give warning to the customers beforehand, allowing them to leave). As he desperately tries to escape, Dollar is captured by Reggie, Clyde, and St. Louis' associate, whom Dollar Bill met earlier. Later, one of St. Louis' men Brooklyn destroy the club with a LAW rocket.\n\nEbony, still sporting the bruises from her rape, now has a job working at the shoe store. Having been berated by two strippers who work at a new club, called Club Sugar Daddy's, with the same slogan that influenced her to strip, she firmly stands her ground. In the end, Diamond narrates that Ebony moved back to Tallahassee, FL to be with her mother. Blue is a top D.J. at a radio station, and he and Diamond are moving further in their relationship. Ronnie and Tricks got jobs at Club Sugar Daddy's after their release from jail. Junior is serving time in prison for raping Ebony, and that he never got married. Reggie and Clyde were last seen at the \"Freaknik\" in Atlanta. St. Louis is still \"running the South\" along with his hired guns, Brooklyn and K.C. Peters and Freeman are still harassing people all day. Little Man is managing a different strip club in Chicago. Dollar Bill was never heard from again (It can be safely presumed that he was murdered by St. Louis' men for his debts as he was last seen being stuffed into the trunk of their car). Diamond becomes a successful reporter, having put the past behind her to move on to a new life with her son and boyfriend.\n\n\nA successful soundtrack was released on March 17, 1998, peaking at #10 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and #2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. It featured artists such as the film's star, Ice Cube, DMX, Master P and Jay-Z, among others.\n\nThe movie debuted at No. 5. It went on to gross $23,047,939 domestically, and $213,546 in foreign markets for a total lifetime gross of $23,261,485.\n\n"}

He was admitted to the seminary of Padua thanks to Cardinal Barberigo, who had formed a high opinion of the boy's talents. As professor of logic and regent of the schools, Facciolati became the leading academic of Padua university during a period of forty-five years. He published improved editions of several philological works, such as the \"Thesaurus Ciceronianus\" of Nizolius, and in 1719 he brought out a revised edition of the \"Lexicon Septem Linguarum\", a Latin dictionary in seven languages, called the \"Calepinus\", from the name of its author, the monk Ambrogio Calepino. The latter work, in which he was assisted by his pupil Egidio Forcellini, he completed in four years, 1715 to 1719. It was written in seven languages, and suggested to the editor the idea of his \"opus magnum\", the \"Totius Latinitatis Lexicon\", which was ultimately published at Cardinal Priole's expense, 4 vols. fol., Padua, 1771 (revised ed. by de Vit, 1858-1887).\n\nIn the compilation of this work the chief burden seems to have been borne by Facciolati's pupil Forcellini, to whom, however, the lexicographer allows a very scanty measure of justice. Perhaps the best testimony to the learning and industry of the compiler is the well-known observation that the whole body of Latinity, if it were to perish, might be restored from this lexicon. Facciolati's mastery of Latin style, as displayed in his epistles, has been very much admired for its purity and grace.\n\nIn or about 1739 Facciolati undertook the continuation of Nicolò Comneno Papadopoli, who wrote a history of the University of Padua, carrying it on to his own day. Parts claimed by Papadopoli concerning Nicolaus Copernicus were later exposed as fraudulent by Carlo Malagola and Leopold Prowe. Facciolati was known over all Europe as one of the most enlightened and zealous teachers of the time; and among the many flattering invitations which he received, but always declined, was one from the king of Portugal, to accept the directorship of a college at Lisbon for the young nobility. He died in 1769. His history of the university was published in 1757, under the name \"Fasti Gymnasii Patavini\".\n\nIn 1808 a volume containing nine of his \"Epistles\" never before published was issued at Padua.\n\n"}

He previously played for the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Pirates. A closer out of St. John's University, Hansen was drafted in and quickly made his major league debut, but has since spent most of his career in minor league baseball. At , Hansen reportedly can reach with his fastball and mixes in a hard slider.\n\nHansen's collegiate career began at St. John's University in , where he pitched for the St. John's Red Storm. Hansen selected St. John's over Columbia University, Yale University, and Hofstra University.\n\nWhile he struggled during his freshman campaign in 2003, Hansen began to establish himself as a closer during his sophomore season in . \n\nIn 2004, Hansen played collegiate summer baseball for the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). A league all-star, he posted 10 saves and 41 strikeouts in 22.1 innings pitched without allowing an earned run. In 2018, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.\n\nHansen posted a 3-2 record with 14 saves in his junior season of 2005, registering 85 strikeouts in 64 innings pitched, a 1.68 ERA, and was named a first-team All-American by \"Baseball America\".\n\nWith the 26th pick in the first round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft, the Boston Red Sox selected Hansen and signed him to a four-year deal valued at $4 million. The Red Sox added him to the 40-man roster, assigning Hansen to a conditioning stint in Fort Myers before sending him to the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs. Hansen joined the Boston Red Sox as a late season call-up, making his major league debut on September 19 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Hansen struck out the first man he faced, pitching a perfect inning with two strikeouts, and would make three more appearances before the end of the season.\n\nAfter starting the season in Portland and Pawtucket, Hansen was recalled on June 6 by the Red Sox. On June 26, Hansen earned his first major league win in an extra-inning game against the Philadelphia Phillies. On August 20, Hansen entered a tie game against the New York Yankees in the 10th inning only to allow a game-winning home run to Jason Giambi and a two-run home run to Jorge Posada. Hansen would end the season with a 6.63 ERA. During spring training for the season, manager Terry Francona suggested that the team may have rushed Hansen to the majors too quickly.\n\nIn 2007 at Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, he went 3-1 with a 3.86 ERA but did not get a promotion to the eventual World Series Champion Red Sox. Hansen also played in the developmental Arizona Fall League to get extra work in after missing some of the season with forearm tenderness. During the off-season, Hansen underwent surgery in the hopes of correcting the sleep apnea condition that may have affected his stamina and pitching performance.\n\nHansen reported to Red Sox spring training in and initial reports suggested that the team was impressed with his performance.\n\nOn July 31, 2008, Hansen was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates along with Brandon Moss in a three-team deal that sent Manny Ramirez to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Jason Bay to the Boston Red Sox.\n\nOn August 27, 2008, the Pirates optioned Hansen to AAA (Indianapolis Indians). This move was made after Hansen allowed four earned runs without recording an out against the Chicago Cubs the previous night. Hansen was recalled to the Pirates on September 2.\n\nIn 2009, Hansen was diagnosed with brachial plexus neuropathy, a rare condition causing pain, weakness, and numbness in the arms, shoulders, and upper back. Recovery is usually complete, but can take as long as five years. Hansen was able to pitch in a limited number of minor league games in 2010, but was not at full effectiveness, and the Pirates released him in early 2011.\n\nHansen signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets on July 24, 2012. The Mets released Hansen in March 2013.\n"}

Although their \"Classic\" engines were for decades an exemplar of rugged simplicity and reliability, the company eventually failed when customer tastes changed and as tighter emissions regulations took effect. Production of complete engines stopped in 1996, and another company bought the rights to the brand in 1999. Spare parts continue to be produced for existing engines.\n\nBritish Seagull outboards were first sold under the name Marston Seagull. They were developed at John Marston Ltd's \"Sunbeamland\" factory in Wolverhampton by development engineers John Way-Hope and Bill Pinninger. This pair later bought the manufacturing rights and marketed outboards as Bristol Seagull, later moving to Poole and settling for the name British Seagull.\n\nThere are several different British Seagull outboard motor models, usually with a single cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. Originally known as \"The Best Outboard in the World\", then changed to \"The Best Outboard Motor for the World\". Some of the engines had the Villiers patented flywheel magneto, and on its port side was a simple carburettor. Above the cylinder head was bolted a small brass fuel tank whose 10:1, or 25:1 depending on age, fuel/oil mix was gravity-fed to the carburettor via a fuel line. Starting was effected with a hand-wound pull-rope, although a recoil starter was an option. Connecting the motor to the gearbox and propeller were two downtubes, the forward one containing the drive shaft and the aft tube serving as the exhaust, which vented underwater.\n\nThe engines proved very rugged as they used high quality materials, and thousands have lasted for years, even in harsh marine environments many in developing countries too. Seagull outboards were utilitarian in nature with a relatively slow-turning prop, and so were ideal for use in dinghies, tenders and small yachts. The Silver Century Plus model could propel a displacement hull of up to 26 feet in length; but all Seagull outboards were unsuitable for high speed craft.\n\nAn early engine of the company was the Model 102, developed from the Marston models of the 1930s. The Model 102 engines were fairly large and featured an integral engine cylinder block and head, with a water-injected exhaust. Some Model 102 outboards had a propeller, gaining the moniker of \"The Barge Pusher\". \n\nThe model range for which Seagull is most famous is the \"Classic\" range. These \"square block models\" comprised the 64 cc Featherweight (aka Forty Minus) and Forty Plus, and the 102 cc Century and Century Plus. The Forty Minus and Plus used identical power units, but the Plus had a larger gearbox and propeller. The Century and Century Plus used even larger gearboxes and propellers. Classic model engines were produced from the late 1950s until the mid-1990s, and many examples are still in everyday use. The long life span is down to the high quality metals and the use of high-tensile bolts and studs. \n\nIn the early 1980s the factory produced a new series of British Seagull outboards, the QB series. The power units were developed by Queen's University, Belfast (hence QB) whose Mechanical Engineering Department specialised in modernising two-stroke design. Painted black and sometimes known as the Irish Seagull, they featured quieter, more efficient engines, with a water-cooled exhaust and modified cylinder porting.\nIn the late 1980s British Seagull introduced two further models to their range, the Model 170 and the Model 125. Fitted with a cowling to enclose the engine, they featured upgraded carburettors and cylinder blocks. Both new models suffered from poorly designed crankshaft bushings, resulting in warranty claims against the company. Until that time the \"\"Best Outboard Motor for the World\"\" (as the marketing slogan ran) had an envious reputation for reliability, but these new models were never popular and they dented the company's image.\n\nTowards the end of production a new model called the \"5R\" was introduced. The design of this engine was quite different from earlier models, using a conventional gearbox from a Yamaha 4HP outboard attached \"via\" an adaptor plate to a QB engine. These models were painted blue, the very last examples (known as \"gold tops\") having propellers and recoil starters that were gold-painted.\n\nModels manufactured from 1931 to 1945 had a recommended petrol-to-oil mix of either 8:1 or 10:1. From 1942 models specified a 10:1 mix which was specified up to 1979. After that date a 25:1 mix was specified, which was again changed for the introduction of the models 125 and 170, but these engines with the 50:1 mix soon failed, and British Seagull again specified 25:1. This relatively high percentage of oil was necessary due to the way the crankshaft bushings worked. Early engines used short bushings, and later ones used longer bushings, hence the changes in oil requirement. The longer bushings were, in fact, used from 1967 onwards, and the engines from 1967 to 1979 can be used on the 25:1 mix by making carburettor adjustments.\n\n"}
{"id": "2305771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305771", "title": "Mary Carpenter", "text": "Mary Carpenter\n\nMary Carpenter (3 April 1807 – 14 June 1877) was an English educational and social reformer. The daughter of a Unitarian minister, she founded a ragged school and reformatories, bringing previously unavailable educational opportunities to poor children and young offenders in Bristol.\n\nShe published articles and books on her work and her lobbying was instrumental in the passage of several educational acts in the mid-nineteenth century. She was the first woman to have a paper published by the Statistical Society of London. She addressed many conferences and meetings and became known as one of the foremost public speakers of her time. Carpenter was active in the anti-slavery movement; she also visited India, visiting schools and prisons and working to improve female education, establish reformatory schools and improve prison conditions. In later years she visited Europe and America, carrying on her campaigns of penal and educational reform.\n\nCarpenter publicly supported women's suffrage in her later years and also campaigned for female access to higher education. She is buried in Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol and has a memorial in the North transept of Bristol Cathedral.\n\nCarpenter was born in 1807, in Exeter, the first child of Lant Carpenter, a Unitarian minister in Exeter, and Anna (or Hannah) Penn. In 1817 the family moved to Bristol, where her father took charge of the Lewin's Mead Unitarian meeting house. He established a boarding school at Great George Street, Brandon Hill, which was run by his wife and daughters, where Mary studied the sciences, mathematics, Greek and Latin. She taught in the school, had spells as a governess in the Isle of Wight and Hertfordshire and, in 1827, returned to Bristol to become head teacher at what had by now become \"Mrs Carpenter's Boarding School for Young Ladies\".\n\nIn 1833 she met Ram Mohan Roy, a founder of the Brahmo Samaj movement which reformed social Hinduism, and was influenced by his philosophy during his short stay with Miss Castle and Miss Kiddel at Beech House in Stapleton before Roy died of meningitis in September of that year. Later that year she also met Joseph Tuckerman, an American Unitarian who had founded the Ministry-at-Large to the Poor in Boston, Massachusetts. He is said to have directly inspired her start on the path of social reform, partly by a chance remark made when walking with Carpenter through a slum district of Bristol. A small boy in rags ran across their path and Tuckerman remarked, \"That child should be followed to his home and seen after.\" He had established a \"Farm School\" in Massachusetts, which became the model for later reformatories. Carpenter's later writings are based upon ideas she developed from her correspondence with Tuckerman.\n\nIn 1835 she helped organise a \"Working and Visiting Society\", in the slums around Lewin's Mead, of which she remained secretary for nearly twenty years. This group was inspired by Tuckerman's work in Boston. The purposes of such societies were to visit the poor and raise funds from the emerging middle classes to alleviate poverty and improve education. After her father's death in 1840, Carpenter worked with her sisters in her mother's boarding school in Whiteladies Road, Clifton.\n\nIn 1843, her interest in the anti-slavery movement was aroused by a visit from Boston philanthropist Samuel May. In 1846 she attended a meeting which was addressed by prominent abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery in 1838. She contributed to fund-raising efforts in the abolitionist cause and maintained an interest in this for the next twenty years. Her brothers William, Philip and Russell and her sister Anna were also active in this campaign. In 1851 the return of a fugitive slave from Boston back to the southern states caused her to say of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 that the United States had \"committed an atrocious act ... against humanity, against itself, against God.\" This event caused her to concentrate on her educational work.\n\nA bill had been introduced into Parliament \"to make provision for the better education of children in manufacturing districts\", but it failed to pass due to nonconformist opposition as it was seen to give pre-eminence to the position of the Church of England. As a result of the failure of the bill, ragged schools sprang up in many English towns, providing education, food and clothing to the poor, and prompting Carpenter to start such a school herself in Lewin's Mead, Bristol. A night school for adults soon followed. In 1848 the closure of the Carpenters' private school gave her more time for educational and charity work. She published a memoir of Joseph Tuckerman and a series of articles on ragged schools which were published in \"The Inquirer\", an English Unitarian newspaper, and later published in book form.\n\nThis was followed in 1851 by the publication of \"Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes, and for Juvenile Offenders\". She sketched out three classes of schools as urgently needed; good free day schools (for the children in the general population), feeding industrial schools (for children in need) and reformatory schools (for young offenders). This book drew public attention to her work, and she began to communicate with leading educational and reformist thinkers and reformers. Carpenter was consulted by those drafting educational bills, and she was invited to give evidence before House of Commons committees and in 1852 she published \"Juvenile Delinquents, their Condition and Treatment\", which contributed to the passing of the Juvenile Offenders Act in 1854.\n\nIn 1852 she put her ideas into practice, establishing a reformatory school at Bristol in 1852, in Kingswood in the premises of a school which had originally been set by John Wesley. Originally this was for boys and girls, but she soon decided to separate the sexes and set up a girls' reformatory in what is now the Red Lodge Museum in 1854, initially funded by Lady Byron.\n\nWhen Lady Byron died in 1860, Mary Carpenter was given a legacy to outright purchase the Red Lodge, including a cottage to be used for training the girls in domestic service. Mary Carpenter's detailed diaries (Ref. 12693/1-2) (online catalogue) present the earliest days at the Red Lodge transforming it from deserted house into functional school, including the discovery of a human foot in an outhouse. Carpenter's diaries also reveal the use of ‘the cells’ located in the cellar of the Red Lodge for disciplining “violent, refractory and noisy girls”. Other punishments included caning and having their hair cut very short.\n\nThe famous anti-vivisectionist, Frances Power Cobbe worked at the Red Lodge and lived with Mary Carpenter from 1858–9, but a turbulent relationship between the two meant that Cobbe left the school.\n\nHer strong religious beliefs drove her reforms. \"Love must be the ruling sentiment of all who attempt to influence and guide these children\", she wrote in \"Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes, and for Juvenile Offenders\". Now that the principle of reformatory schools was established, Carpenter agitated for free day schools, arguing the ragged schools were entitled to financial aid from the government. At the Oxford meeting of the British Association (1860) she read a paper on this subject, and, mainly owing to her instigation, a conference on ragged schools in relation to government grants for education was held at Birmingham in 1861.\n\nIn the same year, Carpenter was invited to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on the Education of Destitute Children. Amongst other evidence she criticised Catholic priests who warned young children of Irish immigrants from attending her ragged school. She condemned the \"low Anglo Irish\" as combining \"the vices of the English in a large commercial town with their ... natural character in a very undesirable way.\"\n\nShe further said, \"I can only say that the children told us that the priests had in one case flogged a child for coming to our school, and had used very strong influence to prevent them from coming, and that I have myself been absolutely insulted in the street by Catholic children ... who feel erroneously that they were showing their zeal for their own religion by insulting Protestants.\"\n\nIn 1866 Carpenter visited India, which had been an ambition of hers since her meeting with Raja Ram Mohan Roy in 1833. She visited Calcutta, Madras and Bombay, finding that for the most part girls were not educated past the age of twelve years, mainly due to a lack of educated female teachers. During her visit Carpenter met Keshab Chandra Sen, the leader of Brahmo Samaj. Sen asked her to form an organisation in Britain to improve communication between British and Indian reformers, which she did in 1870, establishing the National Indian Association. She visited many schools, hospitals and gaols and encouraged both Indian and British colonial administrators to improve and fund these. She was particularly concerned that the lack of good female education led to a shortage of women teachers, nurses and prison attendants. The Mary Carpenter Hall at the Brahmo Girls school in Calcutta was erected as a memorial to this work.\n\nShe also participated in the inauguration of the Bengal Social Science Association, and addressed a paper to the governor-general on proposals for female education, reformatory schools and improving the conditions of gaols. She returned to India in 1868 and achieved funding to set up a \"Normal School\" to educate female Indian teachers. In 1875 she made a final visit and was able to see many of her schemes in operation. She also presented proposals to for Indian prison reform to the Secretary of the Indian Government.\n\nAt the International Penal and Prison Congress in 1872 Carpenter read a paper on \"The Principles and Results of the English Reformatory and Certified Industrial Schools\". She read forty papers at conferences of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science between the years of 1857 and 1746, gave many public lectures and was known as one of the most prominent speakers on social reform in an era when few women ever addressed public meetings.\n\nCarpenter's work now began to attract attention in Europe and further afield. Not all of such attention was favourable, Pope Pius IX condemned her books and her work in 1864. Princess Alice of Hesse, who had become interested in social reform, invited her, along with Catherine Winkworth, to Darmstadt to help organise a Congress of Women Workers in 1872. This meeting resolved to work towards a \"better preparation for domestic life\" and \"to pay greater attention to the mental development of an interest in the practical problems of life.\" At the conclusion of the meeting Carpenter proposed the establishment of an International Union for the Industrial Education of Women. She went on to Neuchâtel, Switzerland to study Louis Guillaume's prison system, and in 1873 to America, where she met abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass. She visited prisons and in 1874 wrote to the New York Prison Association to express her concern about \"the dreadful state of the Prisons\".\n\nCarpenter supported the movement for the higher education of women, and had always supported the feminist cause but for most of her life would not do so publicly, believing that the unpopularity of the movement for women's suffrage might damage her educational and penal reforms. But she did in 1877, the year of her death, appear on a public platform in Bristol, supporting the \"Bristol and West of England Society for Women’s Suffrage\". She was invited for an interview with Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale at Windsor Castle in 1868.\n\nCarpenter never married, but she did adopt a five-year-old girl, Rosanna in 1858. She died, in her sleep, at the Red Lodge in June 1877 and was buried at Arnos Vale Cemetery. Her funeral cortège was half a mile long. A public meeting in October 1877 raised £2,700 to be spent on her reform schools and a memorial in Bristol Cathedral.\n\nThe reformatory school in Kingswood was active until 1984 and the Red Lodge Girls' Reformatory closed in 1918. Carpenter's campaigns for juvenile penal reform had a major influence on the development of a more enlightened regime for dealing with young offenders. Her writings, political activism and public addresses had a major influence on correctional education in Britain, Europe, India and America and helped bring about major reforms in the 19th and 20th century. However, many of the causes of youth crime apparently remain unaddressed in the early 21st century and failures in contemporary youth jails have been criticised by official bodies.\n\n\nPapers and correspondence of Mary Carpenter, the Red Lodge Reformatory, and the Kingswood Reformatory are held by Bristol Archives (Ref. 12693) (online catalogue). Records relating to Mary Carpenter can also be found at Boston Public Library, Dorset History Centre, Oxford University: Tate Library, Huntington Library and the British Library Manuscript Collections.\n\n\n\n"}

The name derives from the late Roman coin \"solidus\".\n\nIt quickly became widespread in Italy where it was coined in Genoa, Bologna, and numerous other cities. In Venice, the soldo was minted from the reign of Francesco Dandolo onward, remaining in use also after the republic's dissolution in 1797 and during the Austrian occupation, until 1862.

It was released on 6 February 2019, as the fifth single from his debut studio album, \"Gioventù bruciata\" (2019). Mahmood co-wrote the song with Dario \"Dardust\" Faini and Charlie Charles, who also produced it.\n\nMahmood performed the song for the first time at the 69th Sanremo Musical Festival in February 2019 and won the competition, receiving the right to represent Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. \n\"Soldi\" was later confirmed as his Eurovision entry, eventually reaching second place in the final. The song is predominantly in Italian, with one line in Arabic, making it the fourth time that a Eurovision song features the Arabic language after entries by in , in and in . \"Soldi\" topped the charts in Greece, Israel, Italy and Lithuania and reached the top 10 in five more countries. The song became the most-streamed Eurovision song ever on Spotify.\n\nInterviewed by \"TV Sorrisi e Canzoni\", Mahmood revealed he started writing the song while hanging out with some friends. Despite this, it took a long time for him to complete the song. Producers Dardust and Charlie Charles contributed its sound, renewing it with contemporary elements borrowed from trap music. \nHip hop sounds are also mixed with Arabic influences.\n\nThe song structure does not include a proper chorus. According to Italian producer and musician Andrea Rodini, the song's hook is based on three different elements: the repetition of the word \"soldi\" (\"money\"), the verse \"come va\" (\"what's up?\"), pronounced multiple consecutive times, and the sound of clapping hands, which Rodini describes as a \"cubistic\" chorus.\n\n\"Soldi\" is an autobiographic song about Mahmood's \"unconventional family\". Its lyrics explore Mahmood's relationship with his father, who left his family while he was a child. It depicts a lying, contradictory and unreliable father, whose main priority is money instead of his own family. Money is therefore represented as one of the causes of the end of a father-and-son relationship, marking a strong departure from trap music themes, which usually depicts money as the ultimate goal of life. Mahmood explained that the song's lyrics \"evoke a memory\" and that \"there's a lot of anger\" in it. Its verses reproduce a series of different pictures, often used by Mahmood as metaphors.\n\nThe song also includes a sentence in Arabic. Although he cannot speak Arabic, Mahmood explained that he remembers how his Egyptian father called him when he was a child, and that he chose to include this verse as a way to bring him back to a particular moment in time.\n\nIn December 2018, Mahmood was one of 24 acts selected to compete in \"Sanremo Giovani\", a televised competition aimed at selecting two newcomers as contestants of the 69th Sanremo Music Festival. Competing acts were split in two separate groups, which performed in different live shows. A winner from each group was declared, and Mahmood placed first in the second episode of the show, with his entry \"Gioventù bruciata\". Mahmood also received the Critics' Award among acts performing in the second final.\n\"Soldi\" was later announced as his entry for the Sanremo Music Festival 2019.\n\nMahmood performed the song for the first time during the first live show of the 69th Sanremo Music Festival, which was held on 5 February 2019. He was the 24th and final act to appear on stage, performing after midnight. Dario \"Dardust\" Faini, co-writer of the song, directed the Sanremo Orchestra during his performance. During the third live show, \"Soldi\" was the first performance of the night. On 8 February 2019, Mahmood performed the song in a new version, featuring rapper Gué Pequeno.\nDuring the first round of the final, \"Soldi\" placed 7th in the televote, but was the most voted by the experts jury, and the second most voted by the press jury. As a result, Mahmood gained a spot in the top three acts of the competition. After an additional performance, the song was declared the winner of the 69th Sanremo Music Festival, beating Ultimo's \"I tuoi particolari\" and \"Musica che resta\" by Il Volo, which placed second and third, respectively.\nMahmood also received the \"Enzo Jannacci\" Award for Best Performance.\n\nFollowing his win, it was confirmed by RAI and the European Broadcasting Union that Mahmood had accepted the invitation to represent Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest, which is given to the winner of the Sanremo Music Festival, and that he'd be performing \"Soldi\" at Eurovision.

In the film Billy Wyatt, a washed-up baseball player, is called back home to collect the ashes of his childhood sweetheart Katie Chandler, who had committed suicide. While doing so, he remembers the relationships he had with her and people he grew up with. \n\n\"Stealing Home\" was released theatrically on August 26, 1988 by Warner Bros. Upon release the film was a critical and commercial failure, although David Foster's musical score garnered universal praise. Over the years, however, it has garnered a cult film status with television re-runs and DVD releases with audiences praising its pace, nostalgic themes and soundtrack.\n\nIn the 1980s, Billy Wyatt is a thirty-something washed up baseball player who lives out of a hotel with a cocktail waitress. One afternoon he receives a phone call from his mother to tell him that his close childhood friend Katie Chandler has committed suicide.\n\nFlashbacks to the 1960s explain Billy and Katie's relationship. Katie was a slightly older neighborhood girl who babysat Billy for The Wyatt family who were best friends with the Chandler family (Katie's parents).

Two months later Katie, Billy, Ginny, and Alan Appleby go back to their summer home \"Seasmoke\" as they do every year and decide to spend the summer there, the first summer without Billy's dad. This begins a summer of humor, coming of age, and loss of innocence. As summer approaches its end, Billy feels Katie is encouraging his mother to live more freely too soon. Billy has a shouting match with Katie. The next day at sunrise, Billy goes to Katie for forgiveness, but what ensues is a deeply suppressed love for each other. This last weekend of the summer defines their true feelings and makes a memory they never forget. They encourage the others to return home while they spend the rest of the weekend together at Seasmoke. Their passion and love that weekend defines their special relationship in life, and in death. As the weekend draws to a close Katie asks that Billy pursue his passion for baseball, and to retrieve the baseball necklace pennant from the girl to whom he lost his virginity just months before. Walking slowly away, she turns and says \"I love you Billy boy\". The older Billy remembers that was that last time he saw her. \n\nIn the present, Katie's father Hank visits the Wyatt family to share the bad news. He recounts how he drove to Seasmoke to check on an upset Katie after her second divorce, and found her body lying in her bed. \"She looked like a little girl sleeping.\" Katie's wishes are for Billy to take possession of her cremated ashes, confident that Billy would be the only person to know what to do with them. \n\nBilly reunites with his childhood friend Alan Appleby and the two engage in a night of reminiscing and carousing while driving around in Katie's car with Katie's ashes, trying to figure out what to do with her ashes. Suddenly, Billy recalls Katie telling him her fantasy that she could jump off the pier and fly free with the birds. The next morning, Billy goes to the pier, runs down the plank and tosses her ashes just the way she described her fantasy. As he watches the ashes and birds fly freely, Billy realizes this was Katie's plan for him all along. She was speaking to him! The pennant retrieval was for a reason, the trip back home was for a reason, playing baseball with Appleby was for a reason, and all this was done with Katie's ashes in his arms! This directed him towards new sense of possibility in his own life, Billy reunites with a former girlfriend and joins a minor league baseball team; taking pride in grooming the field each morning before a game. The film ends with Billy, his girlfriend, and Appleby celebrating after a game.\n\n\nThe film plot is set in the Philadelphia area and the New Jersey shore. The filming occurred in many locations:\n\nThe film received negative reviews around the time of its release. In her review for the \"New York Times\", Janet Maslin wrote, \"The era is simply established as a dreamily idyllic past, thanks to sand dunes at twilight, waves that crash in the distance, shiny red convertibles without seat belts and a musical score that may make you want to weep, for all the wrong reasons\". In his one-star review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert wrote, \"I detested \"Stealing Home\" so much, from beginning to end, that I left the screening wondering if any movie could possibly be that bad\". The movie currently holds a 22% Critics rating and a 78% Audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWhen asked about the film in 2006, Mark Harmon said, \"That was about a bunch of actors loving a script, going there and burning it on both ends for five weeks just to get it done. That was a fun one to make. I hear a lot about that role. People really found that movie on video.\"\n\nEver since the release of \"Summer of '42\", Warner Bros. has attempted to buy back the rights to the film, which they sold to author Herman Raucher in lieu of paying him for the script, under the belief that the film would not be financially successful. \"Stealing Home\" was greenlit shortly after Raucher denied their latest attempt to purchase the rights, leading to \"Summer\" star Jennifer O'Neill's assertion that \"Stealing Home\" was \"stolen\" from \"Summer\". Regardless, she said that she enjoyed the film and called it a \"lovely film.\" Rita Kempley, in her review for the \"Washington Post,\" also saw similarities with \"Summer\", describing the film as a \"pale comedy-drama by mediocrities Steven Kampmann and Will Aldis. Admittedly a pastiche of their memories, the movie bespeaks the dust of '60s yearbooks and greeting card sentiment. Of course, that stuff can be touching (\"Summer of '42\") or quirky (\"Gregory's Girl\"), but here only allergy sufferers will leave with soggy Kleenex.\"\n\n\n"}

The game was negatively received, particularly for its character animations and artificial intelligence. Critics also viewed the game as a poor imitation of \"Battlefield 1942\".\n\n\"Terminator 3: War of the Machines\" is a first-person shooter game with a focus on online multiplayer. The game takes place during a post-apocalyptic war between Skynet's Terminator machines and the Tech-Com human team. The player chooses which team to join, and each character is labeled with their team affiliation to inform other players. Three game modes are featured: the online multiplayer Team Deathmatch mode; the objective-based Mission mode, in which players hold or overrun an area; and Termination, which is a single-player mode played against bots as the player tries to capture an enemy base.\n\nTech-Com's humans have a variety of weapons, and Skynet's machines have their own weapons as well.

It was developed by Hungary-based Clever's Games, and was published by Atari. The game features the likeness and voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger, reprising his role as the T-800.\n\nThe game was released in the United Kingdom on November 28, 2003, and was shipped to North American retailers on December 3, 2003.\n\n\"Terminator 3: War of the Machines\" was poorly received by critics, who considered the game to be a poor imitation of \"Battlefield 1942\". Some criticized the graphics, while Jamie Madigan of GameSpy considered them and the sound to be only average. The character animations, including death animations, received some criticism. Madigan called the animations \"stilted and seemingly incomplete.\" Bob Colayco of GameSpot compared the death animations to the act of pushing a mannequin over: \"When you kill an enemy, it stiffly falls over on its back or face.\" Colayco said that this may be \"excusable\" for killing machines, but that it did not make sense for humans to also die in the same manner.\n\nColayco also criticized the sound, as well as the level designs, writing that \"many pathways lead to dead ends, which creates a lot of wasted space on the maps.\" Madigan wrote that the levels are full of \"pointless dead ends, long stretches of mundane terrain, dry land, and not much that keeps you interested.\" Norman Chan of \"PC Gamer\" believed the levels were too small in design, and was critical of the fact that several levels are minor variations of each other set in different time periods.\n\nCriticism also went to the game's artificial intelligence, which Madigan cited as a reason the game was not fun, writing, \"Enemies will often run right past you and into danger.\" Some criticized the limited online servers. Madigan stated that with the \"inaccessible\" multiplayer and \"deeply flawed\" single-player modes, \"It's a game that feels incomplete and practically abandoned by its publisher.\" Criticism was also directed at the lack of story. John Walker of \"PC Format\" criticized the poor controls, and William O'Neal of \"Computer Gaming World\" criticized the slow and unwieldy vehicles. Madigan was critical of the limited game options, and Chan felt the game modes were uninspired. In addition, because each player is labeled with their team affiliation, Chan believed that this resulted in a wasted opportunity for Terminator players to infiltrate the human force.\n"}

As a boy, he worked in a lace factory, where he attracted the notice of the leaders of the Baptist community, who sent him to the academy at Leicester and the Baptist college at Nottingham to be educated for the ministry. In 1858, he was called to the Praed Street chapel, Paddington (London), and while officiating there he attended University College and pursued his education by working at the British Museum.\n\nHe matriculated at the University of London (1859), and took its Bachelor of Arts degree (1861), Bachelor of Science (1862), Master of Arts (1864), and Bachelor of Laws (1866), and in 1883 he was given the honorary degree of DD by Bates College, United States, being known thereafter as Dr Clifford. This degree, from a small American college, afterwards led to sarcastic allusions, but Clifford had not courted it. Clifford's achievements at the University of London provided evidence of his intellectual equipment.\n\nAt the Praed Street chapel, he gradually obtained a large following, and in 1877 the Westbourne Park chapel was opened for him. As a preacher, writer, propagandist and ardent Liberal politician, he became a power in the Nonconformist body. He was president of the London Baptist Association in 1879, of the Baptist Union in 1888 and 1899, and of the National Council of Evangelical Churches in 1898. He was instrumental in ensuring that the Baptist Union endorsed the liberal side in the Downgrade controversy, and in arranging the censure of Charles Spurgeon.\n\nIn 1899, he became a prominent campaigner against the Boer War. He was on the South Africa Conciliation Committee executive and he was president of the Stop the War Committee. As well as being a critic of the British treatment of the Boers he was a critic of the Union of South Africa's negotiated terms because of the un-equal treatment of the majority black population in the country.\n\nHis chief prominence in politics, however, dates from 1903 onwards in consequence of his advocacy of passive resistance to the Education Act of 1902. He threw himself into this movement with militant ardour, his own goods being distrained upon, with those of numerous other Nonconformists, rather than that any contribution should be made by them in taxation for the purpose of an Education Act, which they believed to be calculated to support denominational religious teaching in the schools.\n\nThe passive resistance movement, with Clifford as its chief leader, had a large share in the defeat of the Unionist government in January 1906, and his efforts were then directed to getting a new act passed which should be nondenominational in character. The rejection of Augustine Birrell's bill in 1906 by the House of Lords was accordingly accompanied by denunciations of that body from Clifford and his followers. However, year by year went by, with nothing but failure on the part of the Liberal ministry to arrive at any solution of the education problem.\n\nFailure was now due not to the House of Lords but the inherent difficulties of the subject, as it became increasingly clear to the public generally that the easy denunciations of the act of 1902, which had played so large a part in the elections of 1906, were not so simple to carry into practice. A compromise, in which the denominationalists would have their say, was the result. Meanwhile, passive resistance lost its interest though Clifford and his followers continued to protest against their treatment.\n\nClifford was appointed Companion of Honour (CH) in the 1921 New Year Honours.\n\nThe Mahatma Gandhi quoted Dr Clifford as one of the early models of passive resistance before developing Satyagraha as a more complete concept than just passive resistance.\n\n"}
{"id": "2305833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305833", "title": "Oxford University Labour Club", "text": "Oxford University Labour Club\n\nOxford University Labour Club (OULC) was founded in 1919 to promote democratic socialism and is today the home of the Labour Party and of social democracy at Oxford University. OULC is the largest and oldest university Labour club in the country and has a particular reputation as an active campaigning force.\n\nThe club caters for any students who are interested in the ideals of the labour movement whether members of the Labour Party or entirely new to politics. Stewart Wood, special adviser to consecutive Labour Party leaders Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, said that 'OULC is held up as an exemplar of what needs to be done.' During his visit to Oxford in July 2009 the Prime Minister Gordon Brown was reported as having praised OULC's 'brilliant contribution to progressive politics in the University, the city and the country.' The club was instrumental in returning Andrew Smith to Parliament for Oxford East at the 2010 General Election with a 4.1% swing to Labour, the largest in England outside London.\n\nThroughout the year it hosts a range of speaker, social, discussion, and campaigning events, as well as producing a termly magazine called Look Left. Signature events include the annual Barbara Castle Memorial Lecture and John Smith Memorial Dinner.\n\nIn 2016, some officers of the Oxford University Labour Club resigned citing allegations of anti-Semitism in the club. This resulted in the national Labour party officially investigating the club for anti-Semitism. In March 2018, the OULC released a statement calling for ‘greater action to root out antisemitism’ from the national Labour Party.\n\nWhen David Lewis came to Oxford, the Labour Club was a tame organisation adhering to Christian activism, or the not-quite-so-scrappy-socialist theories of people such as R. H. Tawney and his book \"The Acquisitive Society\". David's modified Jewish Labour Bundist interpretation of Marxism, that Cameron Smith labels \"Parliamentary Marxism,\" ignited the renewed interest in the club after the disappointment with Ramsay MacDonald's second Labour government.\n\nThe Oxford newspaper \"The Isis\" noted Lewis' leadership ability at this early stage in his career in their 7 February 1934 issue: \"The energy of these University Socialists is almost unbelievable. If the Socialist movement as a whole is anything like as active as they are, then a socialist victory at the next election is inevitable.\"\n\nIn February 1934, British fascist William Joyce, (Lord Haw Haw), visited Oxford. Lewis and future Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation leader Ted Jolliffe, organised a noisy protest against the fascist, by simply planting Labour Club members in the dance hall that Joyce was speaking in, and causing a commotion, as groups of two and three left making much noise on the creaking wooden floors. The speech was foiled. Afterwards, the Blackshirts contingent had a street battle in Oxford with members of the Labour Club and the townsfolk.\n\nLewis prevented the communists from really making inroads at Oxford during his time there. He increased the Labour Club's membership by three-quarters, from 484 members in December 1932 to over 850 members by the time he left, while the October club never rose above 300 members. Ted Jolliffe stated \"there was a difference between his speeches at the [Oxford] Union and his speeches at the Labour Club. His speeches at the Union had more humour in them; the atmosphere was entirely different. But his speeches at the Labour Club were deadly serious... His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else's, I think, explains the failure of the Communists to make headway there.\" In 1935, the Soviet controlled Comintern's Seventh Congress, called for a united left response to fascism, called the popular front. The communist October Club used this call, for a popular front, as a pretext to have a union between themselves and the Labour Club. Under Lewis' leadership, the club was able to easily defeat a motion by the October Club, as only 20 OULC members voted for the union.\n\nWhen Lewis returned to Canada in the summer of 1935, there really wasn't anyone to replace him, to keep the communists at bay as \"The Isis\" noted: \"The Labour may have rejected fusion [with the October Club] but the matter is not yet settled. An interesting thing is the dearth of what are technically known as 'promising people' in the ranks of the Labour Club. For years the Labour Club has been turning out a Geoffrey Wilson, a Frank Hardie, a John Cripps, a David Lewis, each year: but this [coming] year there seems to be no figures as outstanding as these.\"\n\nSince there was not a strong Labour leader to take over from Lewis after he graduated and left in the summer of 1935, the Labour Club amended its constitution to remove impediments to fusion with the communist October Club in December 1935. Shortly thereafter the two clubs joined together forming a \"popular front\". The club's membership peaked before the war at between 1000 and 1200 members depending on whose numbers were used, which was approximately a fifth of all of Oxford's 5023 students. Of the club's total membership, the Communists made up approximately less than 200 members.\n\nThe national Labour Party appointed Janet Royall, to head an inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism within the Club made in February 2016. The then-current Co-Chair and another officer resigned from the Club, alleging they were disturbed by the discrimination and anti-Semitism they alleged was inherent in the Club.\n\nAfter successfully campaigning for the re-election of Andrew Smith as Member of Parliament for Oxford East, with an increased majority, in the 2015 General Election, and increasing the number of Labour councillors on Oxford City Council in the 2016 local elections, OULC campaigned hard during the European Union referendum. At the Michaelmas term 2015 General Meeting, OULC voted overwhelmingly to endorse UK membership of the European Union and to actively campaign in favour of the UK's continued membership of the European Union in the coming referendum campaign. This involved campaign stalls, door knocking and rallies. OULC did however host Graham Stringer MP who gave the Labour case for 'Brexit', during an address in Wadham college in Trinity term. This was in the same term that OULC hosted Chuka Umunna MP, Anneliese Dodds MEP, Andrew Smith MP and Alan Johnson MP, the leader of the Labour IN campaign, for signature 'remain' campaign events throughout Oxford.\n\nOULC is run by an elected Executive Committee, as established under the OULC Constitution. The Constitution can be changed by a two-thirds majority at any OULC General Meeting, Termly General Meeting (TGM), or Extraordinary General Meeting; at which its members can also pass policy in the form of motions (such as submissions to the Labour Party's Policy Review), hear reports from the executive and elect (at the TGM) the new Executive.\n\nUnder the most recent version of the OULC Constitution (as of Trinity Term 2016), the head of the Executive is the two Co-Chairs. One Co-Chair position must at all times be held by someone who 'self-identifies partly or wholly as a woman or transfeminine'[13], and two other positions on the Executive at every TGM, must be reserved for those who self-identify partly or wholly as a woman or transfeminine. The positions so reserved rotate around the Executive. If no one who self-identifies partly or wholly as a woman or transfeminine stands for such a position, the incoming Co-Chairs must produce a report to be made public, detailing what they will do to enhance the position of those who so self-identify within the Club. This also applies if the only two people standing for Co-Chair are men.\n\nAt the General Meeting in Trinity Term 2016, the Club also re-established its long-forgotten alumni network. Upon receiving permission from Lord Attlee, the grandson of Clement Attlee, the former Labour Prime Minister, the alumni network was named 'The Attlee Association', in the former Prime Minister's honour.\n\nOULC has hosted a range of speakers from the Labour movement, including a number of high-profile politicians. In Trinity term 2009, OULC hosted the then current Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband. He commented \"I recently met with the OULC members and was impressed. [They] can help Labour be at the cutting edge.\"\n\nOULC holds regular informal meetings to discuss policy. This provides its members with an opportunity to engage in serious political debate. An October 2008 review of party political events by the \"Cherwell\" commented that OULC is 'an active political party as opposed to a social gathering. Their meetings are informal, and last year they were visited by a number of prominent left wing politicians.'\n\nOULC also runs campaigns. The club plays a role in the efforts to keep Oxford East Labour and contributed significantly to the election effort in July 2009 where Labour gained four seats on the county council, the most successful Labour result in the county. In its report on the election victory, the \"Cherwell\" cited the club's then co-chair, Jacob Turner, as saying that he felt the result was a consequence of \"a very great effort from the local party including Labour Club members. We've been going out, meeting people, and asking them not to vote for us, but just how our councillors can help them. We've built up a relationship with residents which is ultimately expressed in voting.\"\nIn the run up to the 2010 General Election the club regularly turned out 20 campaigners every Sunday. This made a huge contribution to Oxford East's position of having the highest voter contact rate of anywhere in the country (more than Wales, Scotland and the North-East put together). In 2012, the club was instrumental in Labour winning its first Student Ward in the city in over two decades. When possible the club sends members to other towns to campaign, including Reading, Slough, Southampton and even Edinburgh.\n\nOULC holds a number of social events including a fresher's dinner in Michaelmas Term and a barbecue or picnic in Trinity term. OULC also hosts an annual dinner, the John Smith Memorial Dinner, in the fifth week of Hilary term. The dinner commemorates the contribution and life of John Smith, the former Labour party leader, who died suddenly in 1994. Recent speakers at this event have included Neil Kinnock and Margaret Beckett.\n\nOULC is affiliated with Labour Students, and former OULC members have held a number of positions there.\nIn February 2011, OULC disaffiliated from Labour Students for a one-year period as a protest over the way the organisation was run. In February 2012, OULC voted by 20 to 4 to rejoin Labour Students citing the progress made by the leadership of the organisation in improving accountability and democracy.\n\nOULC also has links with other socialist organisations, trade unions, and Labour Party groups, including the Oxford District, Reading and Slough Labour Parties.\n\nSince the establishment of the Oxford University Student Union (OUSU) in the early 1970s, OULC has maintained a presence.

{"id": "2305842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305842", "title": "CD8", "text": "CD8\n\nCD8 (cluster of differentiation 8) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a co-receptor for the T-cell receptor (TCR). Along with the TCR, the CD8 co-receptor plays a role in T cell signaling and aiding with cytotoxic T cell antigen interactions.\n\nLike the TCR, CD8 binds to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, but is specific for the MHC class I protein.\n\nThere are two isoforms of the protein, alpha and beta, each encoded by a different gene. In humans, both genes are located on chromosome 2 in position 2p12.\n\nThe CD8 co-receptor is predominantly expressed on the surface of cytotoxic T cells, but can also be found on natural killer cells, cortical thymocytes, and dendritic cells. The CD8 molecule is a marker for cytotoxic T cell population. It is expressed in T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and hypo-pigmented mycosis fungoides.\n\nTo function, CD8 forms a dimer, consisting of a pair of CD8 chains. The most common form of CD8 is composed of a CD8-α and CD8-β chain, both members of the immunoglobulin superfamily with an immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like extracellular domain connected to the membrane by a thin stalk, and an intracellular tail. Less-common homodimers of the CD8-α chain are also expressed on some cells. The molecular weight of each CD8 chain is about 34 kDa. The structure of the CD8 molecule was determined by Leahy, D.J., Axel, R., and Hendrickson, W.A. by X-ray Diffraction at a 2.6A resolution. The structure was determined to have an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich folding and 114 amino acid residues. 2% of the protein is wound into α-helices and 46% into β-sheets, with the remaining 52% of the molecules remaining in the loop portions. \nThe extracellular IgV-like domain of CD8-α interacts with the α portion of the Class I MHC molecule. This affinity keeps the T cell receptor of the cytotoxic T cell and the target cell bound closely together during antigen-specific activation. Cytotoxic T cells with CD8 surface protein are called CD8+ T cells. The main recognition site is a flexible loop at the α domain of an MHC molecule. This was discovered by doing mutational analyses. The flexible α domain is located between residues 223 and 229 in the genome. In addition to aiding with cytotoxic T cell antigen interactions the CD8 co-receptor also plays a role in T cell signaling. The cytoplasmic tails of the CD8 co-receptor interact with Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase). Once the T cell receptor binds its specific antigen Lck phosphorylates the cytoplasmic CD3 and ζ-chains of the TCR complex which initiates a cascade of phosphorylation eventually leading to activation of transcription factors like NFAT, NF-κB, and AP-1 which affect the expression of certain genes.\n\n"}
{"id": "2305851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305851", "title": "Siberian jay", "text": "Siberian jay\n\nThe Siberian jay (\"Perisoreus infaustus\") is a small jay with a widespread distribution within the coniferous forests in North Eurasia. Although its habitat is being fragmented, it is a common bird with a very wide range so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \"least concern\".\n\nThe Siberian jay shares its genus \"Perisoreus\" with the Sichuan jay of China and the North American Canada jay. However, the Siberian jay differs from the other two species in group living behaviours. Unlike the other two species, where group individuals unrelated to breeding parents may help to provision the young n, the group individuals that accompany a breeding pair of Siberian jays do not help raise the offspring. This absence of extra parental care despite group living may be because cooperative breeding has been selected against in the Siberian jay; probably as an anti-predator strategy to avoid predator attention.\n\nThree Siberian jay subspecies occur west of Ural, with \"P.i.infaustus\" from Fennoscandia and Kola Peninsula grading into \"P.i.ostjakorum\" and \"ruthenus\" eastwards (Cramp and Perrins, 1994). About 13 further subspecies have been reported further east. With the arrival of coniferous forests in Scandinavia just after the last ice age, the Siberian jay probably expanded its range from east to west in response to the new suitable habitat emerged from climate warming.\n\nThe Siberian jay is the smallest of the western Palearctic corvids, weighing 75-90g and measuring about 30 cm in length. The adult plumage is greyish brown, with a dark brown head, paler forehead and buff breast. The rump is yellowish and the chin and throat are grey. There is also rufous streaking on the outer feathers, and the bill and legs are black. Their overall colouration is fairly inconspicuous to visually conceal them from predators within their forest habitat. The plumage is also very soft and fluffy for insulation against extreme cold in winter. There is one moult per year, which lasts from mid-June to mid-September. An individual can live for up to 20 years, although the average lifespan has been reported as 7.1 years.\n\nNewly hatched young are almost bare and are closely covered by the female. Juveniles look similar to adults, but have paler heads.\n\nSiberian jays appear to be specially adapted in flight to navigating dense forest, whilst they are rather cumbersome flyers in open terrain; which may explain their vulnerability to raptor predators outside forests.\n\nThe Siberian jay is mostly silent but can utter a loud scream which resembles that of a buzzard (Buteo spp.). The song, which is given by both sexes; mainly in the breeding season and heard only from a short distance, comprises many different sounds. These range from soft and harsh notes, whistling, creaking, trilling and mimicked song of other birds.\n\nThe Siberian jay is resident in the northern boreal forests of spruce, pine, cedar and larch stretching from Scandinavia to northern Russia and Siberia. It has an extensive range estimated at 19300000 km^2 and is native to Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan and China. It is vagrant in Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine. Although the species is largely sedentary, some individuals in the east of the range may move southwards in winter.\n\nThis jay favours dense, mature forest habitat with closed canopy within lowlands and foothills. Spruce forest is the preferred foraging and nesting habitat because the denser foliage of spruce than other local conifers offers greater concealment from predators. Indeed, breeding success has been linked to higher foliage density; where eggs and nestlings are less likely to attract attention of predators. Additionally, the benefit of increased predator evasion through more hiding space would probably outweigh the cost of making predators more difficult to see by the jays within the dense foliage. The Siberian jay is notably selective in its choice of territory, with a typical territory comprising old dense spruce swamp with ample vegetation cover. Territories also tend to be structurally diverse, comprising variably aged scrub, groves and flood meadows; so that active territories may be regarded as an indicator of high ecological diversity within the forest.\n\nThe Siberian Jay is omnivorous and feeds mainly on berries, seeds, insects and spiders. Flocks will also feed on large carcasses killed by mammalian predators such as wolves and wolverines. Other occasional food items include eggs of small birds, tit nestlings, snails, slugs, small mammals and lizards. In autumn and winter, berries (especially bilberries and cowberries) are typically collected and stored behind loose bark or in hanging beard lichen and between forked twigs. Siberian jays distribute many different hidden food caches over a large area and are therefore known as scatter hoarders. However, unlike in other corvids, this hidden food stash is not purposefully shared with siblings to increase inclusive fitness but is consumed by the hoarder or a pilferer for selfish use. These food caches are critical to this species’ winter survival since foraging time is greatly restricted by the few hours of daylight. To securely store food, Siberian jays have developed special saliva glands which they use to form sticky food clumps which they then adhere to beard moss or holes in tree bark; where they are readily accessible throughout the winter. Because of their reliance on food stores during winter, they are territorial birds with reserves scattered around the territory, especially near to the nest.\n\nWhen foraging, Siberian jays often stay within closed forest to avoid visual detection by predators, although they may occasionally forage for insects in wet tussocky open areas. They forage in flocks comprising 3-5 individuals within their large territory. Especially in winter, Siberian jays will also venture into increasingly open areas to take and store small rodents for food when the latter are abundant.\n\nThe young are fed a high proportion of insect larvae, which is collected by the male and stored in his oesophagus, until he returns to the nest to regurgitate it to feed to the young. In the first week of brooding, the male provides the female and young with all their food, and the female takes an increasing share of the work thereafter.\n\nSiberian Jays are strictly monogamous and an established pair will stay together and hold the same territory for life. Mate guarding in both sexes has been observed in this species, whereby males and females become increasingly aggressive toward same-sex conspecifics (Ruth, 2016). This may prevent extra-pair mating opportunities for the partner and thereby preserve inclusive fitness for both pair members. The size of the territory is , which is slightly enlarged in autumn and winter. Although territories are firmly established, the jays can move to a neighbouring site if this is a better quality habitat where breeding success will be higher. Widowed individuals have been observed to establish new pair bonds.\n\nThe nest is situated in a pine or spruce tree 4-6m above ground within dense foliage to minimise detection by nest predators. The nest comprises a loose cup of dry twigs broken off trees by the jays and is thickly lined with beard lichen moss, down feathers, cobwebs, reindeer fur and wasp nest fragments; which is necessary insulation against the extreme winter cold. Nest material is hoarded in winter long before building takes place. Nest building then begins in late March and lasts about three weeks. Both partners collect nest material; but only the female builds the nest.\n\nThe eggs are pale green, blue or grey and spotted with grey and brown. Average egg dimensions are 31.6 x 22.9mm. They are laid 31 March – 22 April, with a variable clutch size of 1-5 (and incubation period of about 19 days (Coombes, 1978, Eggers, 2006). The eggs are incubated entirely by the female, whilst the male provides all the food for the brooding female and the chicks. The Siberian jay is single brooded and does not relay in a breeding season even after nest failure, but will wait until next year. A new nest is also built for every breeding attempt.\n\nThe young fledge in mid-May to early June and leave the nest around this time, 18–24 days after the first chick has hatched; although they usually hide within tree branches on the territory until able to fly. Parents continue to feed them for about three weeks after fledging and all remain in a family group throughout summer, autumn and winter. Most mature young disperse from the natal territory in their first summer 4–8 weeks after fledging to join new groups which are usually more than four territories away from the natal territory. These early dispersers are generally subordinates which have been out-competed and displaced by one or a few socially dominant offspring that are retained. If offspring have not yet dispersed by the time they are eight weeks old, they usually remain in the natal territory at least through the first winter. The retained, socially dominant offspring which remain on the natal territory may wait for up to five years before dispersing when a breeding opportunity arises. Retained offspring can also claim their natal territory, but only if both parents disappear within a short time, which is rare. Offspring may inherit and breed at a new territory to which they disperse. However, if there are no vacant territories to occupy, juveniles can join a different family group to gain feeding advantages and may attempt to establish own territory at an age of 2–3 years.\n\nThe species has a complex and unusual social structure. Siberian jays live in small flocks of 2-7 individuals, with the dominant breeding pair at the centre of the group; alongside retained multigenerational offspring and unrelated immigrants. Within a group, there is a dominance hierarchy; whereby males are dominant over females and breeders are dominant over non-breeders; with some male non-breeders being dominant over female breeders. Flock composition varies, with some comprising only family members, families associated with nonrelated immigrants, and others containing only nonrelated individuals. Immigrated unrelated individuals can be tolerated within the territory outside nesting areas.\n\nAt least one offspring usually remains with the parents after successful reproduction and regularly accompanies the pair for at least a year before dispersing; although some retained offspring delay dispersal for up to five years. These are the dominant offspring, which out-compete and expel their subordinate siblings. The dispersed subordinate individuals (which disperse in their first summer) settle as non-breeding immigrants in other existing flocks and tend to disperse much further than their dominant siblings, which more often move straight into a breeding position in a new territory. Unusually for a group living species of Corvidae, group members do not help the parents raise younger siblings in future cohorts (there is no cooperative breeding) and so offspring retention is not explained by cooperative breeding. Groups also unusually stay together outside the breeding season.\n\nRetention of some offspring in the natal territory after fledging is probably explained by nepotism which parents show toward them. Parents provide retained offspring with reliable access to resources and antipredator protection, thereby imparting to them a survival advantage (in turn with an inclusive fitness advantage to the parents). Although delayed dispersal of offspring may be explained by “queueing” for available high-quality territories for the offspring to occupy, the influence of nepotism has been shown experimentally. In removal experiments in which a father alpha male in a group was replaced with a new male unrelated to the offspring, the offspring were more likely to disperse prematurely; probably because the new male did not impart the same nepotistic advantages to the now unrelated young. Although retained offspring may incur an initial cost of postponing breeding, this may be offset by enhanced breeding success later in life as a result of resource advantages gained from nepotistic parents; and late dispersers have been found to have higher lifetime reproductive success than early dispersers.\n\nSiberian jays also display nepotistic alarming calling and these calls may function as a warning to conspecifics of an approaching predator. Warning calls have been shown experimentally to decrease reaction time in response in an approaching predator and improve survival within non-breeding individuals. However, females seem more able than males to differentiate between kin and non-kin(Griesser and Ekman, 2004). Alongside direct warning to family group members, nepotistic alarm calling by a breeding female may also function to divert predator attention away from her offspring.\n\nSiberian jays are aggressive to non-related intruders on their territory. Two different aggressive responses from territory holders within feeding grounds have been observed:(1) the intruder is approached and forced away (2) or is chased in flight; although the latter behaviour is more costly to the aggressor. Although breeders show considerably more aggression toward immigrants than retained offspring, aggressive responses appear to be modified by social dominance within groups. For example, females have been found to receive notably more aggression than males because males show more resistance owing to their higher social dominance, therefore leading to higher energy cost by the aggressor. Siberian jays also appear to recognise their own young through associative learning as opposed to genetic cues, as shown by experiments in which Siberian jays did not differentiate between own and fostered offspring.\n\nBirds of prey, especially hawks such the goshawk and sparrowhawk, are the main predators of Siberian jays. Most Siberian jay predators detect prey visually, so that ample forest cover together with the jays’ cryptic colouration and secretive nesting help render the jays inconspicuous to predators. Predators of this species’ eggs and young include squirrels, ravens, hooded crows, magpies and Eurasian jays. As an antipredator measure, the nest is built in the dense foliage to minimize predator attention. Females also appear to lay smaller clutches under higher predation pressure, and this may minimise predator attention to the nest through fewer necessary nest visits by the parent. Further, in higher cover nests, chicks are fed by the parent more evenly than in exposed nests more detectable by predators; so that chicks raised in well-concealed nests are expected to have better growth.\n\nThe European range of the population is threatened by habitat degradation through forestry, road building, settlements and agriculture. Modern European forestry practices in particular may be decreasing breeding habitat quality for the Siberian jay primarily through reduced foliage cover. This may occur through forest thinning, whereby lower-quality trees are regularly removed from forest stands. Excessive clearcutting has been linked with increased territory abandonment by Siberian jays and in turn strong decreases in the species’ breeding success in affected areas. Another practice which may threaten the Siberian jay has been the large-scale removal of stands of native spruce to be replaced with pine, potentially leading to loss of sufficient visual cover of nesting activity from predators with removal of spruce. In Finland, spruce has also been declining faster than other forest types and loss and fragmentation of spruce forests through forestry has been linked with population declines here. Anthropogenic habitat loss may be interacting with natural threats from predators. The Siberian jay population has declined more than can be explained by anthropogenic forest clearance alone, which may be attributable to increased nest exposure to avian predators and other human activities favouring these predatory species. Human activity may also lead to increases in nest predators such as Eurasian jays through activities such as supplemental feeding and refuse dumpling, in turn compounding the predation pressure on Siberian jays through increased exposure. Finally, destruction by felling of winter food storages in trees near territories during winter may also destroy winter food caches.\n\nAlongside increased predator attention, the open land exposed as a result of forest habitat fragmentation also presents an apparently large dispersal barrier which the jays find difficult to cross given their apparent cumbersomeness at traversing open land. Siberian jays are also apparently unable to evolve fast enough to adapt to these anthropogenic habitat and predator population changes. Because this species is markedly sedentary, there appear to several genetically isolated subpopulations. Given this jay's high site fidelity, gene flow between subpopulations may have been low even before onset of modern forestry practices which have created the strong dispersal barriers.\n\nSiberian jays are reported to be fearless in human company, and with repeated provision of food by humans in the same place may become tame enough to take food from the hand. This was especially the case formerly when forestry workers regularly left patches of food scraps in the forest for the jays to take; with the same being true around campfires. The Siberian jay has now gained flagship status as a conservation concern both because of threats from modern forestry and because active territories are considered a sign of high-quality biodiverse forest.\n\nThe Siberian jay is evaluated as Least Concern by the IUCN because of the species’ exceptionally large range. Although the world population is decreasing, the magnitude of this decrease is not considered sufficiently large to render the species Vulnerable. The world population is very large and estimated at 4295000-7600000 mature individuals. Population declines have been reported to be strongest in the southernmost part of the range.\n\n"}

He was one of the most influential Anglican theologians of the 19th century, helping reconcile the church to some aspects of biblical criticism and scientific discovery, while remaining Catholic in his interpretation of the faith and sacraments. Also known for his social action, Gore became an Anglican bishop and founded the monastic Community of the Resurrection as well as co-founded the Christian Social Union. He was the chaplain to Queen Victoria and King Edward VII.\n\nCharles Gore was born on 22 January 1853 into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family as the third son of Hon. Charles Alexander Gore (1811-1897), grandson of Arthur Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran, and Lady Augusta Lavinia Priscilla, a daughter of John William Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough. His brother Spencer was the first winner of the Wimbledon Championships.\n\nGore was raised in a low-church Anglican family and was confirmed by the church at the age of eight years. He was attracted to the high-church sacramental tradition and ritualism of Anglo-Catholicism at a young age, later writing \"I have since my childhood been what I may call a Catholic by mental constitution\". Around the age of nine years, he read Grace Kennedy's anti-Catholic novel \"Father Clement\". The book served as his introduction to the high-church tradition and, instead of having his Protestantism reinforced as the author had intended, he found himself entranced by the Catholic tradition. He would later write of it:\nIn his evidence given before the Ecclesiastical Discipline Commission in 1905 he said:\nIn his adolescence, he began attending churches \"that offered a richer sacramental ceremonial.\"\n\nGore's parents sent him to Harrow School, London, in 1866, where he excelled academically. He then went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1871, where he supported the trade-union movement. He graduated from Oxford in 1875 with a first-class degree in \"literae humaniores\".\n\nIn 1875, Gore was elected a fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and he lectured there from 1876 to 1880. Gore was ordained to the Anglican diaconate in December 1876 and to the priesthood in December 1878. From 1880 to 1883, he served as vice-principal of Cuddesdon Theological College. He received Honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from various universities, including University of Athens, University of Birmingham, University of Oxford, Durham University, and University of Edinburgh.\n\nWhen, in 1884, Pusey House was founded at Oxford, in part as a memorial to Edward Bouverie Pusey, and as a home for Pusey's library, Gore was appointed as principal, a position he held until 1893. As Principal of Pusey House, he exercised wide influence over undergraduates and the younger clergy and it was largely under this influence that the Oxford Movement underwent a change which to surviving Tractarians seemed to involve a break with its basic principles. Puseyism had been in the highest degree conservative, basing itself on authority and tradition and repudiating compromise with the modern critical and liberalising spirit. Gore, starting from the same basis of faith and authority, found from experience in dealing with the doubts and difficulties of the younger generation that this uncompromising attitude was untenable and set himself the task of reconciling the principle of authority in religion with that of scientific authority, by attempting to define the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence. To him the divine authority of the Catholic Church was an axiom.\n\nIn 1889, he published two works, the larger of which, \"The Church and the Ministry\", is a learned vindication of the principle of apostolic succession in the episcopate against the Presbyterians and other Reformed church bodies, while the second, \"Roman Catholic Claims\", is a defence, in more popular form, of Anglicanism and Anglican ordinations and sacraments against the criticisms of Roman Catholic authorities.\n\nSo far Gore's published views had been in consonance with those of the older Tractarians, but in 1890 a stir was created by the publication, under his editorship, of \"Lux Mundi\", a series of essays by different writers attempting to bring the Christian creed into a harmonious relation to the modern growth of knowledge, scientific, historic, critical, and to modern problems of politics and ethics. Gore himself contributed an essay on \"The Holy Spirit and Inspiration\" and, from the tenth edition, one of Gore's sermons, \"On the Christian Doctrine of Sin\", was included as an appendix. The book, which ran through twelve editions in little over a year, met with a mixed reception. Traditional clerics, both Evangelicals and Tractarians, were alarmed by views on the incarnate nature of Christ which seemed to them to impugn his divinity and, by concessions to the higher criticism in the matter of the inspiration of scripture, appeared to them to convert the \"impregnable rock\" (as Gladstone had called it) into a foundation of sand. Sceptics, however, were not impressed by a system of defence which seemed to draw an artificial line beyond which criticism was not to advance. The book nonetheless produced a profound effect far beyond the borders of the Anglican churches and it is largely due to its influence, and to that of the school it represents, that the Anglican high church movement developed on Modernist rather than Tractarian lines from then on.\n\nIn 1891 Gore was chosen to deliver the Bampton Lectures, and he took for his subject the \"Incarnation of Christ\". In these published lectures, Gore developed the theology of \"Lux Mundi\", attempting to explain how Christ, though incarnate God, could err (for example, in his citations from the Old Testament). The orthodox explanation had been based on the religious principle of accommodation. This, however, had not solved the difficulty that if Christ on earth was not subject to human limitations, especially of knowledge, he was not as other men, not subject to their trials and temptations. Gore addressed this through revisiting the Kenotic Theory of the Incarnation. Theologians had attempted to explain what Paul the Apostle meant when he wrote of Christ (Philippians 2:7) that he emptied himself (\"kenosis\") and took upon him the form of a servant. According to Gore this means that Christ on his incarnation, although sinless, became subject to all human limitations and stripped himself of all attributes of Godhead, including omniscience, the divine nature being hidden under the human.\n\nThe Bampton Lectures led to a tense situation, which Gore relieved in 1893 by resigning his principalship of Pusey House and accepting the position of vicar of Radley parish near Oxford.\n\nIn 1894 Gore became a canon of Westminster Abbey. Here he gained commanding influence as a preacher and in 1898 was appointed one of the court chaplains. In July 1901 he was appointed a Chaplain-in-Ordinary to King Edward VII, though he resigned as such on elevation as bishop in January 1902.\n\nIn 1892, while Principal of Pusey House, Gore founded a clerical fraternity, known as the Society of the Resurrection. The society became a religious community and he became its first superior, only resigning when appointed as Bishop of Worcester in 1902. Its members were Anglican priests bound by the obligation of celibacy, living under a common Benedictine rule and with a common purse. Their work was pastoral, evangelistic, literary and educational. The community followed Gore to Radley in 1893, most of them remaining there when he moved to London in 1894. In 1898 the House of the Resurrection in Mirfield, near Huddersfield, became the centre of the community. The Community later also admitted lay brothers, and its monastic character became more central, moving closer to the Benedictine tradition.\n\nAlthough the community followed a liturgical day familiar to Roman Catholic monks, Gore and the other founders wanted it to engage in social action. Five of the six founding members belonged to the Christian Social Union, hence the decision to settle in the industrial north, between Wakefield and Huddersfield.\n\nIn 1903 a college for training candidates for the Anglican priesthood, the College of the Resurrection, was established in Mirfield and, in the same year, a branch house for missionary work was set up in Johannesburg in South Africa.\n\nIn November 1901 Gore was nominated to succeed J. J. S. Perowne as Bishop of Worcester. The appointment caused some controversy, due to his teachings and relationship to the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury (he was a cousin of Lord Salisbury's daughter-in-law). The Church Association and the Liverpool Laymen's League were among societies lodging formal protests before his confirmation. After subsequent legal hearings, Gore was consecrated as Bishop at Lambeth Palace on 23 February 1902, and enthroned at Worcester Cathedral two days later on 25 February.\nHe received the degree Doctor of Divinity from the University of Oxford in December 1901, and was elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in May 1902.\n\nIn 1905 Gore was installed as the first Bishop of Birmingham, a new see, which he had helped to create by dividing his see of Worcester. The second parish church of Birmingham, St Philip, became the cathedral. While adhering to his views on the divine institution of episcopacy as essential to the Christian Church, Gore from the first cultivated friendly relations with the ministers of other Christian denominations and advocated co-operation with them in all matters when agreement was possible.\n\nIn social questions Gore became a leader of the group of high Anglicans known loosely as Christian socialists. In 1889 at Pusey House Gore had helped found the Christian Social Union. He worked actively against the sweating system, pleaded for European intervention in Macedonia, and was a keen supporter of the Licensing Bill.\n\nIn 1911 he succeeded Francis Paget as Bishop of Oxford and Chancellor of the Order of the Garter.\n\nOn 28 September 1917 Gore licensed 21 women as lay readers called the \"Diocesan Band of Women Messengers\". These were possibly the first female lay readers in the Church of England. The last one, Bessie Bangay, died in 1987 aged 98.\n\nGore resigned in 1919 and retired to London, where he lived at 6 Margaret Street as a tenant of the parochial authorities of All Saints, Margaret Street. There he remained for several years, celebrating regularly in the church and in the sisters' chapel close by, and taking his usual keen interest in the affairs of the church and parish. At the same time Gore attached himself to Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street, and was licensed to the Rector of St George's, Hanover Square, in whose parish that chapel stands, thus becoming for the first time in his life a licensed curate.\n\nGore was a bundle of contradictions, an Anglo-Catholic in the Church of England whose questioning of the Old Testament produced in the 1890s a crisis for many believers. In the judgment of his biographer, Gore was a loner who thought he had a vocation to community life. He chose to be buried at Mirfield, in the church of the Community of the Resurrection, though he had never managed to be more than a visitor there.\n\nIn 1929–1930, he delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures on the topic \"The Philosophy of the Good Life\" at the University of St Andrews.\n\nGore died on 17 January 1932 in Kensington, London. He left instructions for his body to be cremated, a practice seen by some at the time as unacceptable for a Christian. Nearly three decades earlier, in a letter read at the 1903 opening ceremony of the Birmingham Crematorium, Gore had written:\n\nGore's wishes provoked the Anglo-Catholic leader and politician Lord Halifax to exclaim, belatedly, \"I could shake the life out of him with my own hands.\" The ashes were taken to Mirfield in Yorkshire for burial. His cope and mitre remain at the Grosvenor Chapel.\n\n\n\"Belief in God\", \"Belief in Christ\" and \"The Holy Spirit and the Church\" were reissued in a single volume as \"The Reconstruction of Belief\" in 1926.\n\n"}

He was a noted philanthropist, who donated over £100 million in his lifetime.\n\nBotnar was born in Chernivtsi, which was then called Czernowitz and belonged to Austria-Hungary. During his childhood, in 1918, Austria-Hungary dissolved and his hometown, renamed Cernăuţi, became part of Romania. Under its present name it is now part of Ukraine.\n\nHe spent 1932–1936 in prison. Afterwards, he moved to France, where he joined the French Resistance and fought against the Nazis in World War II. He returned to Romania in 1946 and remained there until 1960. In 1966, he fled Communist Eastern Europe and ended up in Worthing in England. It was in Worthing that he founded Datsun UK (now Nissan UK) in 1970.\n\nBotnar had originally run the UK import business for the German manufacturer NSU, however this business was dissolved when NSU was taken over by Volkswagen in 1969 (ultimately becoming Audi), and Botnar was looking for a new venture. He successfully became the UK franchisee and importer for Nissan, and its Datsun range of cars. Under Botnar's leadership, Datsun had become one of the biggest car imports in Britain, outselling not only its arch Japanese rival Toyota but eventually became the most popular foreign brand in the UK. At its peak, Botnar owned more than 200 Nissan dealerships throughout the country and was considered one of Britain's wealthiest men. \n\nOctav's only child, Camelia Botnar, was killed in a car crash near Stonehenge in 1972 at the age of 20. Her death led to a wave of philanthropy that saw Botnar donate millions to charity throughout his later life. One of his larger donations was £13 million to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. \n\nHe also established the Camelia Botnar Foundation in his daughter's memory. The foundation, located in West Sussex, is still active today, providing residential training and work experience, helping young people to learn a skilled trade, embark on a useful career path and successfully make their own way in life.\n\nIn June 1991, the Inland Revenue raided Nissan UK's headquarters, as well as Mr Botnar's home and the homes of other company officials. The tax authority accused Botnar of evading more than £200 million in taxes. Botnar left for Switzerland and lived for the rest of his life there in Villars-sur-Ollon. \n\nThe Nissan UK and AFG businesses subsequently foundered, after Nissan took its UK distribution and import activities completely in-house in 1991.\n\nAlthough Botnar maintained his innocence up until his final hours, he had agreed to pay £59 million to settle the case. Following settling, he opened a suit against the Inland Revenue for damages and malicious prosecution. At the time he said: \"The damages I am seeking are only token, but I want to clear my name. I want my day in court.\" \nBotnar spent his last years as a tax exile in Switzerland fighting the Inland Revenue. \n\nHe died on 11 July 1998 at the age of 84 after suffering from stomach cancer. He is buried in the Passy Cemetery, Paris. Tory party chairman Lord Parkinson once described Botnar as <nowiki>\"truly one of our greatest philanthropists\"</nowiki>. \n\nA biography of the life of Octav Botnar, written by John Laughland, was published in October 2018.

He is the most recent male defender to win the U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year award.\n\nOnyewu grew up in the Washington, D.C. suburbs of Silver Spring and Olney, Maryland, where he attended St. Andrew Apostle School and Sherwood High School. Onyewu enrolled in the U.S. residency program in Bradenton, Florida,\nbefore returning to Sherwood to graduate. He then played two years of college soccer at Clemson University in South Carolina. He moved to Europe in 2002, signing with Metz of Ligue 2 in France. In 2003, he was loaned out to La Louvière in Belgium.\n\nOnyewu was loaned to Standard Liège in 2004. The move to Liège was made permanent for the 2004–05 season. After the season, he was named to the Belgian league's Best XI as well as Foreign Player of the Year for 2005. Having been the subject of many transfer rumors regarding clubs throughout Europe, Onyewu finally completed a loan deal with Newcastle United in January 2007, covering the remainder of the 2006–07 season. He made his debut for Newcastle against Fulham on February 3,\nand his home debut a week later, alongside Titus Bramble, in a 2–1 victory over Liverpool. The two formed an ill-fated partnership, making a number of costly mistakes which was ultimately to cost Onyewu his place. Following the arrival of new manager Sam Allardyce, Onyewu fell out of favor, and Newcastle decided not to make the loan deal permanent.\n\nOnyewu returned to Standard, and his play continued to improve. He made his 100th Belgian First Division appearance for Standard Liège on March 14, 2008, against Germinal Beerschot, and was an integral part of the club as they went on a 29-match unbeaten streak to win the 2007–08 Belgian First Division. After the season, he was named to the Belgian league Best XI for the second time. His strong form continued during the 2008–09 season. He led the Standard defense to a second consecutive Belgian league title. Standard was drawn with Anderlecht at season's end, and Standard won a two-legged playoff for the championship.\n\nOnyewu dealt with racism during his time in Belgium, even having been punched and shouted at by racist fans while playing for Standard Liège.\nThe most well-publicized incident occurred in the 2008–09 Championship playoff when Anderlecht defender Jelle Van Damme, according to Onyewu, allegedly repeatedly called him a \"dirty ape,\" even after Onyewu relayed the information to the referees.\nVan Damme denied the accusations following the match and in return said that Onyewu himself taunted him in a racist way by calling him \"dirty Flemish.\"\nApproximately two weeks later, Onyewu's lawyer announced that he was suing Van Damme in an effort to end on-field racism in European soccer.\nThe case was withdrawn in February 2011 after a meeting between the two players when Van Damme apologized for any offense he may have given.\n\nOnyewu signed a three-year contract with Milan in July 2009, but never played a league game in his eighteen-month spell at the club.\nHe made his debut on September 30 as a substitute in a Champions League loss to Zürich at San Siro.\nOnyewu missed all the 2009–10 season – appearing in only one Champions League match – due to a knee injury suffered while on national team duty. At the end of the season, it was announced that Onyewu's contract with Milan was extended by one season, keeping him under contract with the club until the end of the 2012–13 season; upon Onyewu's request, the one-year extension included no salary.\n\nOn November 5, 2010; Onyewu made international headlines when he and teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović engaged in a fight during training,\nbefore a league match against Bari. It was reported that Onyewu suffered a reckless tackle from Ibrahimović, causing Onyewu to confront him. The two were then separated by teammates, though the club reported he and Ibrahimović have made up for their fight.\n\nIn January 2011, Onyewu joined Dutch side Twente on loan until the end of the season.\nOnyewu made his debut for the \"Tukkers\" on the January 19 against Heracles Almelo in a Eredivisie fixture where he would play the full 90 minutes.\nDespite his stay being short lived at the Dutch side, Onyewu would feature predominantly in both domestic competitions and European competitions where his side reached the quarter finals. His stint with Twente saw him accumulate 14 appearances, as well as pick up a cup winners medal after Twente defeated Ajax 3–2 in the KNVB Cup final.\n\nIn June 2011, Onyewu joined Portuguese side Sporting CP on a free transfer where he signed a three-year deal from A.C. Milan.\nIn Sporting CP's first five competitive games of the season, three Primeira Liga and two European qualifying matches, Sporting manager Domingos Paciência opted to start central defenders Daniel Carriço and Alberto Rodríguez alongside Ânderson Polga, which left Onyewu on the bench. Injuries during the start of the season to Carriço and Polga led to manager Domingos Paciência starting Onyewu in Sporting's line-up. Onyewu made his team debut on the September 10 in a 3–2 away victory over Paços de Ferreira where he would play the full 90 minutes.\nHe scored his first goal for Sporting CP against Rio Ave at the Estádio dos Arcos on September 19, a week after making his Sporting CP debut, in a 3–2 win in which Onyewu scored the winning goal from a header after a Diego Capel corner kick found him unmarked in the penalty area.\n\nUnlike his time with A.C. Milan, Onyewu's playing time increased during the 2011–12 season. During the season, he gradually established himself as the first team regular starter, playing as a center-back alongside Ânderson Polga. Despite the sacking of Domingos Paciência and the introduction of Ricardo Sá Pinto as Sporting manager in early 2012, Onyewu remained a first team regular until mid February where he sustained an injury in a league match against Paços de Ferreira.\nOnyewu's injury which turned out to be an internal lateral ligament and an external meniscus fracture to his right knee kept the American out of action for two months.\nOnyewu's recovery saw him back in late April where he played his first match in two months against Nacional.\nOnyewu's recovery meant he would be available to compete in the 2012 Taça de Portugal Final where his side would come up on the losing end against Académica de Coimbra.\nOnyewu finished his first season with the \"Leões\" with 31 appearances to his name, and scoring five goals.\n\nThe appointment of Ricardo Sá Pinto as Sporting manager led to the arrival of Khalid Boulahrouz and Marcos Rojo, which saw Onyewu loaned out to Spanish La Liga outfit Málaga in August 2012.\nOnyewu made his team debut on October 24 in a UEFA Champions League match as a substitute in a 1–0 victory over his former side A.C. Milan.\nA week later, he started and scored his first Málaga goal against CP Cacereño on October 31 in a fourth-round Copa del Rey tie.\nOnyewu's goal-scoring form continued in the same competition against SD Eibar on December 18, where his stoppage time goal earned his side a draw.\nHowever, Onyewu's stay with Málaga proved to be unsuccessful as he struggled to establish himself as a first-team regular and only managed to play nine matches all season, contributing two goals.\n\nOnyewu returned to Sporting in the summer of 2013, but agreed to a contract termination by mutual consent.\n\nIn October 2013, Onyewu signed with Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer,\nbut he failed to make any appearances and was an unused substitute on six occasions.\nIn January 2014, Onyewu joined Sheffield Wednesday until the end of the season.\n\nIn October 2014, Onyewu signed for Charlton Athletic on a short-term contract, making his debut as a substitute on December 26. The club extended his contract through the end of the season, but he was released following the conclusion of the season.\nOnyewu was released at the end of his contract in May 2015.\n\nOnyewu trialed with Major League Soccer's New York City FC in May 2015 but was not signed. He later spent a preseason tour with Rangers of the Scottish Premiership in June 2016 but was not offered a contract.\n\nOnyewu signed with the Philadelphia Union during the 2017 MLS preseason. Originally brought in to be a veteran presence for a young backline Philadelphia, Onyewu became a regular starter for the Union earning 22 appearances and scoring once. Onyewu was released by the Union at the conclusion of the 2017 season.\n\nIn September 2018, Onyewu announced his retirement from professional soccer via Instagram concluding a 15-year career.\n\nOnyewu was a mainstay on the United States national team for the 2006 and 2010 World Cup cycles. Early in his career, Onyewu represented the U.S. at various youth levels, including at the 2001 World Youth Championship. He made his first appearance for the senior national team on October 13, 2004, against Panama.\nOnyewu scored his first international goal in the 2005 Gold Cup, nodding home the extra time winner in the semifinal against Honduras, and was later named to the tournament Best XI.\n\nOguchi played for the U.S. in the 2006 World Cup, and started in all three United States games. Just before halftime of the third and final group stage match against Ghana, Onyewu conceded a penalty from which Ghana scored, and the U.S. were eliminated with the resultant 2–1 defeat.\nOnyewu was voted the 2006 U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year. He was the first defender to earn the award since Alexi Lalas in 1995.\n\nDuring the 2009 Confederations Cup, Onyewu was paired with Jay DeMerit due to the injury of his normal partner, Carlos Bocanegra, who was unable to play in the group stage. Onyewu played well against Egypt, helping lead the U.S. to a 3–0 win that earned them a berth in the semifinals. He also had a standout performance in the 2–0 semifinal victory over Spain.\n\nIn a World Cup qualifier draw against Costa Rica on October 14, 2009, Onyewu suffered a patellar tendon rupture, forcing him to miss the rest of qualifying.\n\nDuring the 2010 World Cup, Onyewu started and played the full 90 minutes in the United States' first group match against England. During the second group match against Slovenia, he got his second start but was subbed out in the 80th minute.

He was one of the leaders of the rebel victory at the Battle of Three Rocks which led to the capture of Wexford town but was later seriously wounded while leading a rebel column at the Battle of New Ross.\n\nRobert Gogan describes how Kelly was under orders from the Wexford commander Bagenal Harvey to attack the British outposts around New Ross but on no account to attack the town itself.\n\nThe rebels outnumbered the British forces and so Harvey sent a messenger to give them an opportunity to surrender. The messenger was shot while carrying a white flag. This angered the rebels who began the attack without receiving the official order from Harvey.\n\nKelly's column of 800 men attacked and broke through Ross's \"Three Bullet Gate\" and proceeded into the town itself. After initial success, they were eventually beaten back by British troops and Kelly was wounded in the leg. He was moved to Wexford to recuperate but after the fall of Wexford on 21 June was dragged from his bed, tried and sentenced to death. He was hanged on 25 June 1798 along with seven other rebel leaders on Wexford bridge, after which his body was decapitated, the trunk thrown into the River Slaney and the head kicked through the streets before being set on display on a spike.\n\nHis exploits are commemorated in the famous Irish ballad \"Kelly the Boy From Killane\" written by Patrick Joseph McCall (1861–1919).\n\nLiam Gaul describes how McCall wrote the song to commemorate the centenary of the 1798 Rebellion, although it was not published in book form until it appeared in McCall's Irish Fireside Songs in 1911.\n\nGaul says the origin of the melody used in the song is uncertain. There is no known reference to it before it was used in Kelly the Boy From Killane and so it is likely that McCall, who was a talented musician, wrote the tune himself.\n\nDon Partridge recorded a solo acoustic version of the song in 1964, and would later regularly play the song during street busking, before and after his hit records in the late 1960s.\n\nWhat's the news, what's the news oh my bold Shelmalier<br>\nWith your long barrelled guns from the sea<br>\nSay what wind from the south brings a messenger here<br>\nWith the hymn of the dawn for the free<br>\nGoodly news, goodly news do I bring youth of Forth<br>\nGoodly news shall you hear Bargy man<br>\nFor the boys march at dawn from the south to the north<br>\nLed by Kelly the boy from Killane\n\nTell me who is that giant with the gold curling hair<br>\nHe who rides at the head of your band<br>\nSeven feet is his height with some inches to spare<br>\nAnd he looks like a king in command<br>\nAh my boys that's the pride of the bold Shelmaliers<br>\n'Mongst greatest of heroes a man<br>\nFling your beavers aloft and give three ringing cheers<br>\nFor John Kelly the boy from Killane\n\nEnniscorthy's in flames and old Wexford is won<br>\nAnd tomorrow the Barrow we will cross<br>\nOn a hill o'er the town we have planted a gun<br>\nThat will batter the gateway to Ross<br>\nAll the Forth men and Bargy men will march o'er the heath<br>\nWith brave Harvey to lead in the van<br>\nBut the foremost of all in that grim gap of death<br>\nWill be Kelly the boy from Killane\n\nBut the gold sun of freedom grew darkened at Ross<br>\nAnd it set by the Slaney's red waves<br>\nAnd poor Wexford stripped naked, hung high on a cross<br>\nWith her heart pierced by traitors and knaves<br>\nGlory-o, glory-o to her brave sons who died<br>\nFor the cause of long down trodden man<br>\nGlory-o to Mount Leinster's own darling and pride<br>\nDauntless Kelly the boy from Killane\n\n"}
{"id": "2305916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305916", "title": "Vedanta Desika", "text": "Vedanta Desika\n\nSri Vedanta Desikan (Swami Desika, Swami Vedanta Desika, Thoopul Nigamaantha Desikan) (1268–1369) was a Sri Vaishnava guru/philosopher and one of the most brilliant stalwarts of Sri Vaishnavism in the post-Ramanuja period. He was a poet, devotee, philosopher, logician and master-teacher (desikan). He was the disciple of Kidambi Appullar, also known as Aathreya Ramanujachariar, who himself was of a master-disciple lineage that began with Ramanuja. Swami Vedanta Desika is considered to be avatar (incarnation) of the divine bell of Venkateswara of Tirumalai by the Vadakalai sect of Sri Vaishnavite. Vedanta Desika belongs to Vishwamitra gotra.\n\nOn the occasion of 750th anniversary of Vedanta Desika, Indian postal department unveiled a stamp to commemorate the great philosopher's life and highly valued works. The stamp was unveiled by Sri Venkaiah Naidu Vice President of India in May 2019.\n\nDesika was born in the year 1268 CE, to a pious couple named Ananta Suri and Totaramba, who named him ‘Venkatanatha’. When he was five, his maternal uncle, Kidambi Appullar took him to attend a spiritual discourse of Nadadhoor Ammal, a revered Sri Vaishnava scholar of that time. As soon as Ammal saw the divine radiance of the child, he stopped his discourse, and hugged Venkatanatha affectionately.\n\nWhen Ammal told the audience that he had forgotten where he had stopped his discourse, it was Venkatanatha who reminded him immediately, to the astonishment of the assembled scholars. Deeply impressed, Ammal blessed him and predicted that Venkatanatha would become the main torch-bearer for Sri Vaishnavism.\n\nWhen Desika turned seven, Kidambi Appullar accepted Venkatanaatha as his disciple, and taught him arts, sciences and scriptures. By the age of 20, Desika became famous for his mastery over poetry, logic, linguistics, science, Vedanta, debate, and allied arts.\n\nEven though Desika was multi-faceted and famous, he lived a humble and simple life with the support of his wife, Thirumangai. He undertook a vow called uchhavritti, whereby he depended wholly on the Supreme Lord for his household needs by accepting grains and vegetables donated by disciples voluntarily, without actively seeking it.\n\nDesika stayed in several cities and towns through his life such as Thiruvaheendrapuram, Kanchipuram, Srirangam, Sathyagala and Melkote. He also travelled widely all over India on foot.\n\nAt each place, he composed many different works in languages such as Tamil, Sanskrit, Prakrit and Manipravala (a mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil) that revealed his ingenuity, creativity, logic, linguistic expertise, devotional fervour and erudite scholarship.\n\nHe composed over hundred works in the following genre:\n\n• 28 devotional poems in Sanskrit such as Hayagriva-stotram, Kamasika-ashthakam and Gopala-vimshati\n\n• 24 devotional poems and treatises in Tamil such as Gitartha-sangraham and Charama-sloka-churkku\n\n• 11 philosophical treatises such as Shata-dushani, Mimamsa-paduka and Tattva-mukta-kalapam\n\n• 10 commentaries on the works of previous acharyas such as Stotra-ratna-bhashya, Chatus-shloki-bhashya and Tatparya-chandrika\n\n• 5 Narrative poems such as his magnum-opus, the Paduka-sahasram, and the epic poem called Yadavabhyudaya which rivals the decorative poetry of Mahakavi Kalidasa's works, and the Hamsa-sandesha\n\n• 32 esoteric texts revealing the hidden meanings of prappati-marga such as Srimad Rahasya-traya-saram, Paramapada-sopanam, Amrita-ranjani and Amrita-svadhini\n\n• 1 drama named Sankalpa-suryodayam\n\n• 13 works on arts and sciences such as Bhugola-nirnayam and Silpartha-saram\n\n• 4 works that codified religious rites and practices such as Sri-vaishnava-dinasari and Bhagavad-aradhana-vidhi\n\nAppaya Dikshitar, the great mediaeval scholar appreciated Desika by composing a verse in Sanskrit:\n\n\"evam vichintyas sarvatra bhavaah santi pade padhe\nkavi tarkika simhasya kavyeshu laliteshvapi\"\n\n\"Even in the simple and soft compositions of this lion of poetry and lion of logic, there is poetic excellence evident at every step he took, and indeed in every word he wrote.”\nDesika composed his poems in various poetic metres. Vedic literature is written in the form of hymns set rhythmically to different metres, called ‘chandas’. Each metre is governed by the number of syllables specific to it. Poets are expected to conform to these norms in their compositions. Swami Desikan has employed 22 metres in the 862 verses he composed on presiding deities of various temples in India. The following are some of the compositions of Vedanta Desika that provide a glimpse of his mastery over poetry, logic, grammar and philosophy:\n\nHayagriva Stotram: a hymn on Lord Hayagriva, the Lord of Learning, who bestows real knowledge to the reciter, banishing the darkness of ignorance from within him.\n\nAbheethistavam: a prayer to Lord Ranganatha for relief from different types of fear, ultimately seeking and being bestowed refuge at the lotus feet of the Lord\n\nAchyutha Satakam: hundred verses in praise of the Lord of Lords Devanatha, in which Desika expresses his passionate love in the form of a bride\n\nBhagavat Dhyana Sopanam: twelve stanzas that describe the steps for meditating upon the Lord of Srirangam, Ranganathaswami\n\nDasavatara Stotram: describes the ten important incarnations of the Lord to protect the world and uphold the principles of dharma or righteousness\n\nDaya Satakam: hundred verses eulogising the mercy or daya of the Lord of Tirumala. The work is divided into 10 decads, each portraying different qualities of the personified mother, Dayadevi. It commences with the short anushtab metre. Each successive decad employs a more complex metre, till it culminates in decorative poetry that is a sheer delight to hear.\n\nGaruda Dandakam: A complex stotram composed in the Dandakam meter style, and has 108 aksharas in every Paadam. It is believed that Desikan composed it when a snake charmer challenged him to summon the mighty Garuda.\n\nSri Stuti: a prayer to ‘Sridevi’ the Goddess of Fortune that is said to have been composed when a bachelor was sent to Desika, seeking financial help for his marriage. Since Desika himself lived a life of voluntary poverty, he took him to the temple of the Goddess and sang Sri Stuti. This culminated in a shower of gold coins, solving the financial problems of the young bachelor.\n\nSudarshanasthaka: eight verses set in the rare ‘dhritichhandas; metre praising the holy discuss-weapon of Lord Vishnu, wielded by the Lord to protect the virtuous.\n\nKamasikasthaka: is prayer of eight verses to Lord Narasimha who assumed a man-lion form to slay the demon Hiranyakashpu, and protect His devotee, Prahlada.\n\nNyasa sutras: are texts composed by Desika which extract the essence of the sharanagati doctrine of self-surrender. These are the Nyasa Dasakam, Nyasa Vimsathi and Nyasa Tilakam.\n\nVairagya panchakam: five verses that describe the importance of renunciation or vairagya. The word ‘dhana’ or wealth, occurs eleven times, each with a different contextual meaning.\n\nHamsa-sandesha: is a lyric poem of 110 verses, reminiscent of Kalidasa's Meghadhuta. It describes Lord Rama sending a message via a swan to his wife Sita, who was abducted by the demon king Ravana.\n\nYadavabhyudaya: is an epic poem of 24 cantos describing the destiny of the Yadava Kings, the dynasty in which Lord Krishna appeared. It is on par with the Kalidasa's work called Raghuvamsa, which describes the dynasty of the Raghu kings, in which Lord Rama appeared.\n\nPaduka Sahasram: composed of a thousand and eight verses spread over 32 divisions called paddhatis, on the holy sandals of the Lord Ranganatha. Desika was challenged by another scholar to compose 1000 verses in a night, and he completed this work in three hours. Verses in one section form pictorial patterns with the arrangements of the letters used.\n\nTamil works: Swami Desikan's Works in Tamil are numerous, out of which two need special mention: Paramathabhangam, where he describes and refutes 15 schools of philosophy, and Aharaniyamam where he describes the correct types food to be consumed by a Vaishnava.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup 1:\n\n\nGroup 2:\n\n\nGroup 3:\n\n\n\n\n\nSri Vaishnava books record how Goddess Lakshmi, known as Ranganayaki in the holy town of Sri Rangam, personally conferred on him the title of ‘Sarva-tantra-svatantra’ or master of all arts and crafts. It is also believed that Lord Rangantha who is the presiding Deity of Sri Rangam, awarded the title of ‘Vedanta Desika’, meaning: the supreme teacher of the conclusion of all knowledge. This was done because the Lord was immensely pleased when Desika debated with differing scholars, and established the supremacy of the path of loving surrender or prapatti-marga.\n\nHe received other titles such as ‘Kavitarkika-kesari’ and ‘Kavitarkika-simham’, the lion amongst poets; and ‘Ramanuja-daya-patram’, the recipient of Ramanuja's causeless mercy, given in a laudatory verse composed by the famous Brahma Tantra Svatantra Swami.\n\nSeveral anecdotes and stories of Desika's life illustrate various aspects of his character: his unflinching faith in prapatti-marga as revealed by Srimad Ramanuja, his scholarly sophistication, his mastery over scores of arts and sciences, his immeasurable humility, and his unparalleled spirit of detachment and renunciation.\nSwami Desika chanted the Garuda Mantra given to him by his Guru, Appullar, at a place called Thiruvaheendrapuram. Sri Vaishnavas believe that Garuda appeared before Desika and awarded him a sacred mantra in praise of Lord Hayagriva, who is the abode of all knowledge. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Hayagriva appeared before Desika, and blessed him with the nectar flowing from his mouth. It is believed that the Supreme Lord resided on the tip of Desika's tongue, and all his writings and works are therefore specially blessed by the Lord.\n\nIn the year 1327, Srirangam city was invaded by Malik Kafur, the General of Allauddin Khilji, who wanted to loot the temple and destroy its Deities. Desika hid the main Deity of the temple behind a newly built wall, and placed a duplicate Deity in the front. The smaller festival Deity was smuggled out by Pillai Lokachariar and his men, and carried to Tirupati, where it was worshipped secretly for many years. Back in Sri Rangam, Desika wanted to protect rare manuscripts like the Sruti-prakasha, a commentary on the Sri Bhashya of Ramanuja. Desika and the sons of the author of Shrutiprakasha hid amongst the dead-bodies of thousands of Sri Vaishnavas killed by the marauding invaders. They escaped with the rare manuscripts to Karnataka.\n\nTwelve years later, General Gopanna of the Vijaya Nagara empire, defeated the invaders and restored the city of Sri Rangam to its previous glory. Swami Desikan came back to Sri Rangam, and established the rituals and ceremonies for worship in the temple, which are still in vogue today. In particular, he established the chanting of the Tamil compositions called the divya-prabandhams, and installed Deities of the twelve Alwar saints for worship in the temple.\n\nA few admirers of Desika, feeling sympathy for Desika's voluntary poverty and abstinence, decided to mix gold coins along with the rice that went to his house as alms. Desika handed the alms to his wife, who promptly showed him the coins. Desika informed her that they were worms that had got mixed with the rice, and separated them using a blade of grass, and threw them out without touching them.\n\nA few envious scholars wanted to insult Desika. They strung a few shoes just outside his door. When Desika came out of his house the next day, the shoes hit his head. The watching scholars felt that Desika would become angry at being insulted. Instead, Desika exclaimed in great joy, “Oh, what good fortune do I have that the sandals of the great devotees of the Lord have blessed me by touching my head?”\nIncidents from Desika's life teach us how he followed what he preached: and was totally surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord in a mood of utmost humility and detachment.\n\nVedanta Desika is known as Sarva-tantra-svatantra or a master of science, philosophy, arts and crafts. His knowledge in these fields were frequently put to test by those who could not comprehend how a single mind could be so competent in so many diverse fields of knowledge. \nA few episodes from Desika's life will illustrate this.\n\nA mason challenged Vedanta Desika to construct a well by using bricks with uneven dimensions. The Shilpa Sastra, an ancient treatise on arts and crafts from India says that bricks which are uniform in size, have square corners, have a specific size, and are red in colour are the best for construction. Even though the bricks given to him did not fulfil these requirements, Desika used his extraordinary acumen to arrange these bricks in a unique sequence and plastered them to form the circular periphery of the well, which can still be seen in Tiruvahindrapuram. \nOnce a sculptor asked Swami Desikan to make an image out of panchaloha (a mixture of five metals – copper, tin, lead, silver and zinc) on a condition that the image had to exactly fit on the base provided by him. Swami Desikan not only sculpted an immaculate image but also pointed out the defects in the base structure provided by the professional sculptor.\n\nThe Vedic scriptures categorize food into three – sattva, rajasa and tamasa. The sattva food promotes serene mind and long life whereas the rajasa and tamasa foods promote anxiety and laziness respectively. Taking cues from the Vedic scriptures, Vedanta Desika has provided a detailed catalogue of food which should be consumed to maintain a healthy mind and a disease-free life.\n\nVedanta Desika wrote an allegorical drama called Sankalpa Surodayam which beautifully portrays the different aspects of human character and their interplay which can lead a man towards a higher goal – Salvation (moksha), or to a lower goal – the infinite loop of birth and death. Here ‘sankalpa’ is the divine will of the compassionate God to protect humans by granting them salvation and ‘suryodaya’ is the sunrise that dispels the inner darkness of man.\nThe main character in this play is Man with two forces acting on him: (i) divine and (ii) demoniac. The divine forces aspire to attain salvation whereas the demoniac pull him into the unending cycle of birth and death. Vedanta Desika, the mighty genius in poetry and drama, personifies these forces into kings and queens who in turn seem to be assisted by their own armies (the human qualities that drive these forces). Desika, with his subtle wit and deep insight, portrays how these characters debate between the good and the evil propensities as he goes on to establish the divine destiny of Man through them.\n\nIt was in early 18th century that the great mathematician, Leonhard Euler investigated the Knight's tour problem where the knight had to tour the entire chess board without any repetition. But, who would have imagined that this was not just solved by Vedanta Desika, but was woven with intricate poetry and philosophy back in 13th century. In the 30th chapter of his composition, the Paduka Sahasram, Vedanta Desika had used several types of poetic imagery. Chaturanga Turanga Bandham was one such imagery through which the knight's tour problem had already been solved elegantly, 500 years before Euler.\n\nDesika showed his knowledge of the arts and sciences through other works Silpartha-saram, a guide on sculpting, and Bhugola-nirnayam – a research text on the formation of the earth.\n\nIn Sri Vaishnavism, a Thanian is a laudatory dedication in verse composed about an acharya by another acharya who is the subject's pupil and someone whom the subject greatly admired. The Thanian of Desika is:\n\n\"rAmAnuja-dayA-pAtraM j~nAna-vairAgya-bhUShaNaM |\" \n\"shrImad-venkaTa-nAthAryaM vande vedAntadeshikaM ||\"\n\nThis Thanian was composed by brahmatantraswatantra jeeyar of Parakala Mutt on the day of star of Hastham, the star of Varadharaja Perumal of Kanchipuram in the Tamil month of Avani. It is recited before starting Divya Prabandham — the works of Alwars – by Vadakalayars. It translates as \"I salute the great Venkata Natha also called Vedanta Acharya and Lion among poets and logicians and who was well adorned by both Knowledge and discretion and who well deserved the grace of Athreya Ramanujar who also had the same name.\"\n\nVazhi Thirunamam is a set of salutary verses chanted in temples to mark the closure of the day's Divya Prabandha chanting. They are intended to ensure that these temples and the practices as established by the acharyas and desikans will be followed for ever.\n\nVazhi Thirunamam is a set of \"Salutary Verses\" that will be chanted in the Temples at the end, marking the closure of the day's Divya Prabandha Chanting. The Salutary Verses are sung in the Temples to ensure that these temples and the practices as established by the Aacharyas and Sri Ramanuja would be followed for ever. Swamy Desikan's Vazhi Thirunamam is being chanted in most of the Vadakalai Divya Desam all over India. The Vazhi thirunamam with the English Transliteration is as following:\n\n\"Vanja Para Samayam Mattra Vandhon Vazhiye\n\nMannu Pughaz Bhoothooran Manamuhappon Vazhiye\n\nKanja Thirumangai Ughakka Vandhon Vazhiye\n\nKaliyanurai Kudi Konda Karuththudayon Vazhiye\n\nSenjol Tamil Maraigal Thelindhu Uraippon Vazhiye\n\nThirumalai Mal Thirumaniyay Sirakka Vandhon Vazhiye\n\nThanja Parakadhiyay Thantharulvon Vazhiye\n\nThan Tamil Thoopul Thiruvenkadavan Vazhiye!!!\n\nNanilamum Than Vaala; Naan maraigal Thaam Vaala\n\nMaanagaril Maaran Marai Vaazha\n\nGyaniyargal Senniani Ser Thoopul Vedantha Desikane\n\nInnum Oru Nootrandirum!!!\n\nVazhiyani Thoopul varum Vedathasiriyan\n\nVazhiyavan Paadhara Vindha Malargal\n\nVazhiyavan Kodhila Thal Malarai Kondadi Kondirukkum\n\nTheethilla Nallor Thiral!\"\n\nThe meaning of the Tamil Verses are as following:\n\n\"May Your grace live long; for you have changed many unrighteous paths to the righteous path\n\nMay Your grace live long; for you have lived a life as pleasing to Sri Ramanujacharya\n\nMay Your grace live long; for you have given joy for great men with your service\n\nMay Your grace live long; for you have been an embodiment of the words of Thirumangai Alwar\n\nMay Your grace live long; for you have presented the Tamil Vedas the Divya Prabandams very clearly\n\nMay Your grace live long; for you have proved your incarnation of being the Divine bell of the Lord of Seven Hills\n\nMay Your grace live long; for you are blessing us with the path of Salvation\n\nMay Your grace live long; for you are the Lord of Seven Hills whom came to elaborate the Tamil Verses\"\n\n\"May our Swami Desikan live for one more century, for the well-being of the Worlds ( The Earth, the worlds above Earth,\n\nthe worlds below Earth and the Eternal world), for the well-being of Vedas, for the sacred text of Nammalvar's\n\nThiruvaimozhi to present glorious in sacred Sri Rangam; Oh Swami Vedanta Desika, the dusts from your holy feet\n\nare being worn by the great Gyanis to get betterment in their Spiritual life; May You live one more century for our sake!\"\n\n\"May Your grace live long; the grace of Swami Desikan who was born in Thoopul, who has no equivalent in knowledge; who is our\n\ngreatest Philosopher; Long live His Lotus Feet!

It was released on a Thursday every five weeks, and provided recent results, colour photographs from live events, articles on historical and contemporary matters within the business, and exclusive interviews with prominent industry figures. \"Power Slam\" stopped offering subscriptions on 4 February 2014, in anticipation of the closure of the magazine, which occurred on 14 July with the release of issue 237.\n\n\nThe magazine was geared more to pro-wrestling than sports entertainment, covering promotions from all over the world (particularly Japanese puroresu), and has also on occasion covered MMA events. This was often partly to do with involvement of professional wrestling personalities, for example Mirko \"Cro Cop\" Filipović appeared in the pages of \"Power Slam\" numerous times due to Japanese promoters (especially K-1) pitting him against wrestlers in legitimate shoot fights.\n\n\"Power Slam\" took an impartial view on the wrestling world being non affiliated with any wrestling promotion or organization. Contributor Greg Lambert has been an on-screen talent and behind-the-scenes promoter/booker for Britain's Frontier Wrestling Alliance but the magazine never crossed the grounds of journalistic integrity by inviting/allowing him to promote his real-life business.\n\nA 2009 \"Power Slam\" interview with Triple H was subject to scrutiny from the \"Pro Wrestling Torch\", who criticized Triple H's comments within it.\n\nIn 2012, Fin Martin defended CM Punk against ongoing rumours that Punk's \"straight edge\" lifestyle was a ruse. Martin wrote: \"We have spoken to many people over the last eight years who have been to bars and nightclubs with Punk and/or traveled with him in Europe and the U.S. and Canada, and all report that Punk has invariably abstained from alcohol, illegal drugs and tobacco.\"\n\n\"Power Slam\" was used as a reference in the Jim Cornette, James Dixon and Benjamin Richardson book, \"Titan Sinking: The decline of the WWF in 1995\".\n\nEvery year the magazine presented the PS 50 (akin to the PWI 500) listing the 50 wrestlers whom the writers believed to have had the most successful year, in terms of workrate and performance. 2012 winner Hiroshi Tanahashi was the first wrestler to be ranked number one in two consecutive PS 50s, followed by Austin Aries and CM Punk. There was also an annual reader's poll for various awards ('match of the year', etc.) similar to that carried out by RSPW.\n\nDespite their criticisms, their readers polls always crowned WWE as the top promotion of the year until 2005, where TNA overtook the company for the first time. TNA would follow up that victory with another in the 2006 reader awards, although in 2007 the percentage of votes for TNA dropped considerably.\n"}

{"id": "2305961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2305961", "title": "Electric truck", "text": "Electric truck\n\nAn electric truck is an electric vehicle powered by batteries designed to deliver cargo.\n\nElectric trucks have been around in niche application areas for over a hundred years, but more recently the advent of lithium ion batteries has enabled the range of electric trucks to increase to several hundred miles, making them of much wider applicability.\n\nElectric trucks are becoming an alternative to traditional trucks, while creating no local pollution. Due to the high efficiency of electric power trains, running costs are expected to be lower. Their simplicity is also supposed to make maintenance costs much lower. According to the United States Department of Energy, the cost per kWh capacity of battery packs for trucks fell from $500 in 2013 to $200 in 2019.\n\nHowever, electric trucks are usually heavier than diesel trucks, the energy density of lithium ion batteries is far less, so very long range trucking requires recharging en route, causing delays, or the swapping of tractor units.\n\nA few electric general lorries prototypes or produced by small manufacturers, and often converted Diesel units, have been built until the 2000s. Trials with different companies in real-world conditions, for several months or more, have been conducted, for example with Renault, E Force and Emoss heavy-duty lorries in the 2010s. Renault launched its small electric Maxity in 2010 and Mitsubishi Fuso its slightly larger eCanter in 2017. From 2018, other major manufacturers including MAN, Mercedes-Benz and DAF began deliveries of prototypes or pre-production heavy-duty units to companies for real-world testing. In 2019, the first series production of heavy-duty lorries is expected to begin with notably Renault, Volvo and MAN.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Chevrolet produced a small series of an electric S-10 pickup truck. In early 2009, Phoenix Motorcars introduced a test fleet of their all-electric SUT (Sports Utility Truck) to Maui. Miles Electric Vehicles imported the Chinese-designed ZX40ST electric small pick-up in the United States in the late 2010s.\n\nThe Port of Los Angeles and South Coast Air Quality Management District have demonstrated a short-range heavy-duty all-electric truck capable of hauling a fully loaded cargo container. The current design is capable of pulling a cargo container at speeds up to and has a range of between . It uses , compared to for the hostler semi tractors it replaces.\n\nVolvo, DAF, MAN, Freightliner plan to begin series production of electric articulated lorries between 2019 and 2020.\n\nElectric tractors have been built since the 1990s. BYD does make electric tractors.\n\nA common example of the battery electric trucks is the milk float. Since it makes many stops in delivering milk it is more practical to use an electric vehicle than a combustion truck, which would be idling much of the time; it also reduces noise in residential areas. For most of the 20th century, the majority of the world's battery electric road vehicles were British milk floats.\n\nWith a similar driving pattern of a delivery vehicle like the milk float above, garbage trucks are excellent candidates for electric drive. Most of their time is spent stopping, starting or idling. These activities are where internal combustion engines are their least efficient. These and other factors such as ease of driver training resulted in Birmingham City Council opting to use electric dustcarts to start replacing its horse driven carts in 1918. Its use of electric vehicles continued through a number of models including Electricar DV4s until 1971. Electric Dustcarts were also operated by Sheffield and Glasgow.\n\nIn preparation for the 2008 Olympic Games, 3,000 of the internal combustion engine garbage trucks in Beijing were replaced with lithium ion polymer battery pack electric drive trucks. The batteries were procured for about $3,300 each. In France, some all-electric garbage trucks produced by Power Vehicle Innovation have been operating since 2011 in the city of Courbevoie, the first local authorities in France to acquired them.\n\nIn 2014, North America became home to its own electric garbage truck. Called the ERV (electric refuse vehicle) it hit the road in Chicago in September 2014. It was the first of an up to $13.4 million purchase order for up to 20 trucks. The PO was won in a competitive bid by Motiv Power Systems in 2012. The majority of the money used to purchase the first truck came from a DoE grant secured by then-Senator Barack Obama. The City of Chicago runs the Motiv ERV on different residential refuse and recycling routes of up to 60 miles, saving 2,688 gallons a year.\nChicago specified that this ERV must meet the demanding requirements placed on all of its garbage trucks. This included 60 mile range, a payload capacity of nine tons and 1000 pounds per cubic yard of compaction. These specifications make the ERV capable of use anywhere in Chicago. To supply enough electricity to move the truck and power the hydraulics all day, the ERV is equipped with 200 kilowatt-hours of energy, in ten battery packs. Full charge time is 8 hours using the Motiv Universal Fast Charger.\n\nWrightspeed provides electric powertrain for garbage trucks and other medium-duty trucks.\n\nSome attempts to produce such lorries have been made, for example the one by PapaBravo. Electric mining trucks have the benefit of not polluting underground. In case of high-altitude mines, the downhill trip with ore recharges the batteries due to regenerative braking.\n\nMack unveiled the LR refuse lorry in May 2019. Its commercialisation should begin in 2019. New York City Department of Sanitation will test one unit beginning in 2020.\n\nRenault began selling an electric version of its Maxity small lorry in 2010. Renault was the first to build heavy-duty lorries, with three prototypes of electric Renault Midlum and a later Renault D tested in real conditions by different customers (Carrefour, Nestlé, Guerlain) for a few years between 2012 and 2016. A prototype D lorry has been delivered to Delanchy in November 2017.\n\nAfter these years of testing, Renault will commercialise its D and D Wide lorries in 2019. They will be built in France alongside their Volvo counterparts. \n\nVolvo will launch their first mass-produced electric FE and FL lorries in early 2019. They will be built in France alongside their Renault counterparts. For the North American market, an electric VNR articulated lorry will be unveiled in 2019 and enter production in 2020.\n\nMitsubishi Fuso began deliveries of the eCanter in 2017.\n\nMercedes-Benz began delivering eActros units to 10 customers in September 2018 for a two-year real-world test. Customers include Dachser, Edeka, Hermes, Kraftverkehr Nagel, Ludwig Meyer, Pfenning Logistics, TBS Rhein-Neckar and Rigterink of Deutschland, and Camion Transport and Migros of Switzerland. \n\nFreightliner began delivering e-M2 lorries to Penske in December 2018, and will commercialise its larger e-Cascadia in 2019. A total of 50 electric lorries should be on the road by the end of 2019, including 20 units delivered to Penske and NFI. The Portland factory will be renovated to start electric lorry production in 2021.\n\nDAF delivered its first CF articulated lorry to Jumbo for testing in December 2018. It uses a VDL powertrain. The logistics company Tinie Manders Transport got a unit in February 2019 and Contargo in Germany two units in May.\n\nPeterbilt has unveiled in Spring 2018 a partnership with Meritor and TransPower, who will supply all-electric drivetrain systems for two Peterbilt vehicle platforms. They will produce twelve Class 8 579EV day cab tractors and three 520EV dustbin lorries that will be tested for about a year. In January 2019, Peterbilt unveiled its medium-duty 220EV also made in partnership with Meritor and TransPower. Six units should be delivered to its major customer in 2019. The manufacturer expects to have a total of more than 30 electric lorries on the road by the end of 2019.\n\nMAN began delivering a dozen units of various e-TGM lorries (articulated, cooled, flatbed...) in September 2018 for testing purposes with different customers. A small series production will take place before a larger serial production scheduled to begin in 2022.\n\nSince January 2014, COOP Switzerland operates in the region of Zurich an 18 t truck with electric drive. 18 square meters of photovoltaic elements on the truck roof support the battery operation in addition. The truck has a capacity of 300 kW. The solar panels on the roof of the truck along with the recuperation provides 23 percent of the total energy of the vehicle. The range of the truck is 240 km per day. The energy consumption is 130 kWh per 100 km and after deduction of the energy from the solar system and recuperation, it is about 100 kWh per 100 km. A comparable diesel engine consumes about three times as much energy. The industry association Euro Solar European Solar Prize 2014 awarded in the category transport and mobility to Coop for the use of this electric truck. The truck, which the Swiss company E-FORCE had developed ONE AG weighs eight tons, has a gross vehicle weight of 18 tonnes and costs 380,000 Swiss francs. It is about twice as expensive as a diesel version of the truck. The truck is based on an Iveco Stralis chassis. The converted in cash consumption is 10 francs per 100 kilometers, with a diesel truck is 50 francs. According to Coop, the vehicle had a comparable diesel truck emissions concerning superior and equal in the economy. The truck has two LiFePO4 batteries with a capacity of 120 kWh with a weight of 1300 kg. The battery can be replaced within 10 minutes.\n\nThe truck E-Force One won the 2014 German Federal Ecodesign.\n\nTwo vehicles of this electric truck coming since mid-2014 even at Lidl in Switzerland and a truck at the Feldschlösschen Beverages Ltd. are used. Since June 2015, such a vehicle at the company Pistor, Switzerland is in use. Even the shipping company Meyer logistics uses such refrigerated trucks in Berlin. The truck consumes an average of 88 kWh per 100 kilometers when used on the tours to city, intercity and highway routes. The company achieved energy savings by two-thirds compared to a diesel truck. The maintenance and the service life are not higher than a comparable diesel truck. The company wants to use other vehicles of this type.\n\nIn 2018, Siemens and the South Coast Air Quality Management District have launched an electrified highway demonstration project near the Los Angeles Port and Long Beach Port, using overhead lines to supply the trucks with electrical power instead of relying on onboard batteries.\n\nFrom 2012, the eight Dutch companies 2 switch, 020stads distributie, DeRooy, Deudekom, Heineken, Mondial Movers, Sligro and TopMovers each took a 100% electric truck with the name \"Hytruck\" in operation. All trucks are customized solutions with different payloads (up to 10 tonnes), batteries and packages range (150–200 km). The Dutch company Emoss Mobile was system for the production B.V. responsible from Oosterhout: (Emoss short). Among them was a 19-ton electric motor truck of Heineken with 9-tonne payload and 200 km range. With the use of which can be saved annually around 22 tons of and the emission of sulfur oxides SOx and nitrogen oxides NO is suppressed. The last truck was delivered in July, 2014. Since autumn 2014, the Swiss company acts as a general agent of CEEkon AG Emoss in Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein.\n\nIn August 2013, the German discounter TEDi integrated a 12-ton Emoss electric motor truck in its fleet to supply several stores in North Rhine-Westphalia. The range is about 200 km, but thanks to opportunity charging a daily use profile of 300 to 400 km at one charge can be obtained.\n\nOn 22 May 2015, Emoss celebrated the introduction of a 19-ton electric motor truck (based MAN TGM) with cooling assembly and 10-ton trailer in a world premiere. The electric truck is used by Lidl Holland for goods distribution in the city center of Amsterdam. That means that up to 90 tons of per 100 km, can be saved. The 250 kW electric motor use LiFePO4 batteries with a capacity of 200 kWh, which are charged in less than 5 hours.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the company Niinivirta put a 16-tonne Emoss electric truck company into operation for the distribution of goods in Tampere (Finland). The Emoss CM1616 (base DAF LF55) has a 250 kW engine with an instant torque of 2700 Nm and 7 tons of payload. The LiFePO4 batteries have a total capacity of 160 kWh and are protected from the very cold conditions by a special isolation device. With a Fast Charger full charging takes only 3.5 hours.\n\nIn 2011, GGT Electric, an automotive engineering, design and manufacturing company based in Milford, Michigan, introduced a new line of all-electric trucks for sale. GGT has developed LSV zero-emission electric vehicles for fleet markets, municipalities, universities, and state and federal government. The company offers 4-door electric pick-up trucks, electric passenger vans, and flatbed electric trucks with tilt and dump capability.\n\nThe company Lithium Storage GmbH is building together with the company Kuhn Switzerland AG a battery-powered haul truck. The vehicle is to go the end of 2016 in operation. The dump truck weighs 110 tons. The chassis is a Komatsu 605-7. The vehicles have an electric motor with 800 hp and can thus produce 5900 Nm. The battery is a 600 kWh lithium-ion battery. For comparison, diesel vehicles of this type consume approximately 50,000 to 100,000 liters of diesel per year.\n\nIn 2012, Motiv Power Systems announced its electric powertrain control system (ePCS) could be scaled to power any type of truck, from shuttle buses and Class-A school buses, to work trucks, box trucks, and even garbage trucks. The Motiv kit can be used with almost any new truck maker's chassis or for an older truck retrofit. Motiv collaborates with existing truck manufacturers to allow them to sell electric options to their existing customers.\n\nLaunched in 2006, the Newton electric truck is an all-electric commercial vehicle from Smith Electric Vehicles. The Newton comes in three GVW configurations: , and . Each is available in short, medium or long wheelbase.\nThe truck was launched with a 120 kilowatt electric induction motor from Enova Systems, driven by Lithium-Ion Iron Phosphate batteries supplied by Valence Technology. In 2012 Smith re-released the Newton with new driveline and battery systems that were developed inhouse. Smith offers the battery pack in either 80kWh or 120kWh configurations.\n\nNewton was named Green Commercial of the Year in the electric vehicle section of Fleet Transport magazine's Irish Truck of the Year Awards 2010, sponsored by Castrol.\n\n, the Newton is sold worldwide and available with three different payload capacities from . The lithium-ion battery pack is available in varying sizes that deliver a range from and a top speed of .\n\nIn 2011, PapaBravo Innovations, an electric vehicle design, manufacturing and engineering company based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada introduced a full line of heavy-duty underground mining trucks. These off-road 4x4 trucks are the first of their kind; a one-ton platform with full-time 4-wheel-drive capability. They have been designed specifically for \"soft-rock\" underground mining industries. The line of electric trucks ranges from 1/4-ton utility vehicles to 1-ton trucks and a 12-passenger personnel transport vehicle.\n\nBMW Group has commissioned an electrically powered 40-ton truck for transporting material on public roads. The vehicle comes from the Dutch manufacturer Terberg and commutes eight times a day between a logistics center and the Munich BMW plant. The truck battery takes three to four hours to charge. When fully charged, the vehicle has a range of up to 100 kilometres. Thus, the electric truck can theoretically complete a full production day without any additional recharging. Compared to a diesel engine truck, the electric truck will save 11.8 tons of CO annually.\n\nSome of the electric cars made by Alkè (for example the Alkè ATX 100 E) are used in soccer stadiums as open ambulances. The operator of London's cycle hire scheme uses a small number of Alkè electric utility vehicles (alongside other cars and vans) to tow trailers for distributing bicycles.\n\n\n"}

It is served by the 2 train at all times. This station is geographically the northernmost station in the entire New York City Subway system, and the only station to be served exclusively by the 2 train.\n\nThe station officially opened on December 13, 1920, as East 241st Street, when the final portion of the line was opened. The line had been extended one stop north from East 238th Street. This portion of the line had its opening delayed, owing to construction on the line between the two stations for the construction of the 239th Street Yard. Additional time was required to modify the structure to avoid a grade crossing at the entrance to the yard.\n\nThe station was renovated from July to December 2005 at a cost of $17.25 million. The station, as part of the renovation, got a new high-quality public address system, new platform edge and ADA tactile warning strips, major structural repairs, new canopies over the stairs and platforms, repaired walls, renewed floors, and a redesign of the area around the station booth.\n\nIn 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020–2024 Capital Program.\n\nAt this station, there are two tracks, one center island platform and two disused side platforms here. The two tracks end at bumper blocks at the north end of the platforms. The station was formerly set up as a Spanish solution with alighting passengers using the side platforms and boarding passengers using the island platform. Now all passengers use the island platform.\n\nThe middle of the platform features a backlit track departure sign labeled Tracks 3 and 2, indicating which train leaves first. There are also crew quarters at platform level.\n\nTo the south of the station, the tracks make a connection to the 239th Street Yard before splitting into three tracks.\n\nThe 2006 artwork featured at the station is \"Permanent Residents and Visitors\" by Alfredo Ceibal, which focuses on birds living in and visiting the city. The artwork is made of faceted glass in the platform windscreens.\n\nThe exit is at the north end. Fare control is past the bumper blocks, from where there is one stair to the southwest corner of 241st Street and White Plains Road, and two stairs to the southeast corner.\n\nThis terminal station has gone by a number of different names. Becker Avenue was an earlier name for the station at the time of its construction, and it officially opened as East 241st Street on December 13, 1920. By 1984, it was renamed 241st Street on entrances and platform signs.\n\nThe station was initially signed on the New York City Subway map as 241st Street–Wakefield.

After disappointing sales and poor publicity, the band ended their contract with Private Stock and signed with Chrysalis Records in 1977. Chrysalis re-released the album in September 1977, along with the single \"In the Flesh\". The album reached No. 14 in Australia, where the band had already had a Top 3 hit with \"In the Flesh\". The album also charted at No. 75 in the UK in early 1979, where the band had become immensely popular.\n\nThrough the production of Richard Gottehrer, who had worked with the Angels and other artists of the 1950s and 1960s, much of the music is suffused with the girl group sound of that era. Harry told an interviewer in 1978 that the band never intended to be retro and when some journalists described them that way, it was \"quite a shock\". Likewise she rejected any attempt to brand the music as pop, insisting that Blondie played new wave music.\n\nThe album was first digitally remastered by Chrysalis Records UK in 1994.
