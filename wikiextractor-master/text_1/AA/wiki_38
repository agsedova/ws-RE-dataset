{"id": "1837247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837247", "title": "Bullet catch", "text": "Bullet catch\n\nThe bullet catch is a stage magic illusion in which a magician appears to catch a bullet fired directly at him or her ⁠— often in the mouth, sometimes in the hand or sometimes caught with other items such as a dinner plate. The bullet catch may also be referred to as the bullet trick, defying the bullets or occasionally the gun trick.\n\nThe trick usually involves a gun which is loaded and operated by someone with a knowledge of firearms to demonstrate that no deception is being used. In most instances, the bullet is marked by an audience member so that it can be identified later. Great efforts are usually made to show that the person firing the gun does not come in contact with the person catching the bullet. When magicians Penn and Teller perform the bullet catch, in which each simultaneously catches a bullet shot by the other, a line is drawn down the center of the stage, demonstrating that neither will cross to the other side. When done by Dorothy Dietrich and Ted Annemann the bullets to be used are purchased by a committee ahead of time, kept under guard until performance time, and the bullets are chosen at random at the time of the performance.\n\nThe gun is then fired through a target (usually a pane of glass, which shatters or is penetrated by a bullet hole) to demonstrate that the gun has actually fired a bullet and the catcher didn't just hide a bullet in his mouth or hand all along. The performer catching the bullet usually collapses, apparently as a result of performing such a feat, and then rises to produce the bullet which is most often spat onto a plate or tray. Historical accounts of the bullet catch describe the bullet being caught in a handkerchief, in a bottle, on a plate or even on the tip of a sword. In more recent times magicians such as Dorothy Dietrich (1981), and later Criss Angel (2000s), and David Blaine (2008) have caught the bullet in a metal cup in their mouth that makes it credible. The guns that Penn and Teller use in their effect are fitted with laser sights to add to the suspense and drama of the trick, and the magicians present the bullets still between their teeth, before removing them from their mouths.\n\nAs is often the case with magic illusions, there is no single way the bullet catch is performed. The method used varies from performer to performer. The gun or the bullet is rigged in some way; in the simplest form of the bullet catch, the gun is made to fire blanks, and the target through which the 'bullet' passes is set to destruct using a squib. All the performer must do is keep the bullet in his or her mouth until ready to produce it.\n\nIf the gun is to be loaded in front of the audience, a wax bullet is loaded into the firearm. The spray of liquid wax from the barrel of the gun is enough to break the pane of glass. The magician uses misdirection to exchange the marked bullet with one made of wax and place the marked bullet into his or her mouth.\n\nAnother method when doing the trick with a muzzle-loading gun that is loaded in front of the audience or by an audience member is to have a magnetic, rather than lead, bullet. A small magnet attached to the ramrod pulls the bullet back out immediately after loading. When the magician takes the rod, he or she removes the bullet and transfers it to his or her mouth. In this version of the trick the gun is always modified, and only simulates firing a shot. This technique is virtually obsolete, however, because modern firearms do not use a ramrod.\n\nAnother method was to use an entirely real and lethal gun and bullet, and simply have the shooter intentionally miss the magician, who has previously collected the bullet to 'catch', as before. This procedure led to most early deaths from this trick and has since been abandoned.\n\nIn cases where the bullet is marked by an audience member, the marked bullet is then transferred to the magician through sleight-of-hand, or similar markings are made on another bullet by an off-stage assistant, who then transfers it to the magician.\n\nChung Ling Soo (the stage name of the American magician William Ellsworth Robinson) was killed while performing this trick due to an equipment malfunction. The gun used for the trick was set up to discharge a blank in the ramrod tube below the barrel. However, the gun malfunctioned and the bullet that had been loaded into the main barrel was accidentally fired into Soo's lung.\n\nOne of the earliest documentations of the bullet catch appeared in Jean Chassanion's \"Histoires mémorables des grans & merveilleux iugements et punitions de Dieu\" (1586), translated as \"The Theatre of God's Judgements\" by Reverend Thomas Beard in 1597. In the source, the magician is considered to have made himself invulnerable by black magic, but a trick by sleight of hand and prepared equipment is clearly being described, despite this misunderstanding. In Beard's version:\n\"It is not long since there was in Lorraine, a certaine man called Coulen, that was overmuch giuen to this cursed Art, amongst whose tricks this was one to be wondred at: that he would suffer Harquebouses or a pistoll to be shot at him, and catch their bullets in his hand without receiving any hurt\". \nGod's punishment for this use of the cursed art of black magic follows: \"but vpon a certaine time one of his seruants being angry with him, hot him such a knock with a pistoll (notwithstanding all his great cunning) that he killed him therewith\". (\"The Theatre of God's Judgements\" (1597), p.120: \"hot him\" may be a misprint for 'hit him'.)\n\nThroughout the 18th century, variations of the bullet catch were developed by a number of street performers.\n\nIn his 1785 book, \"Natural Magic or Physical Amusements Revealed\", Philip Astley wrote that he himself had invented the trick in 1762. However, two books published in 1761 mentioned the bullet catch as described by Reverend Beard: \"The Conjuror Unmasked\" by Thomas Denton, and \"La Magie blanche dévoilée\" by Henri Decremps (the former an English translation of the French text). In fact, Astley's publication plagiarized much of its material from Descremps, including a similar cover illustration, but altered the material to depict conjurers in a more positive light.\n\nBetween 1813 and 1818 a troupe known as the 'Indian Jugglers', advertised as being from Seringapatam, included the trick in their shows given in London and Dublin. In 1817 \"The Times\" carried a report of a fatal accident in Dublin, allegedly caused when a pistol 'actually loaded with powder and ball was, by mistake, substituted for that prepared in the usual way.' In a later newspaper item however the chief of the troupe, Mr Ramusamee, denied this story, stating that no-one had ever been killed.\n\nAround 1840, Scottish magician John Henry Anderson began demonstrating the gun trick in theatres throughout Britain. Anderson, or \"The Great Wizard of the North\" as he was called, performed for P.T. Barnum, Czar Nicholas, Queen Victoria, and Prince Albert and toured in the United States and Australia, thus bringing the bullet catch into mainstream magic illusions. At least four of Anderson's rivals adapted and imitated his trick in their own performances.\n\nThe bullet catch is arguably one of the most dangerous and daring illusions that a magician can attempt, even when performed in a controlled situation. Legends surround the trick, claiming that more than twelve magicians have been killed while performing it.\n\nAlthough there are few documented cases of death, there are several accounts of the performer being shot. The number of deaths surrounding the bullet catch has given rise to a story that the trick carries with it a curse to those who attempt to perform it, though in reality there have been far more successful performances than fatalities. These magicians often include stories of death, dismemberment and curses as part of the staging of many tricks in order to build up hype.\n\nThomas Frost in his 1876 book \"The Lives of the Conjurors\" wrote of two separate performers in the 1820s, Torrini De Grisy and De Linsky, who were responsible for the deaths of their son and wife, respectively. In 1869, a performer by the name of Dr. Epstein was killed when the tip of the wand he was using to ram the charge into the gun broke off inside and was subsequently launched at him when the gun was fired.\n\nThe best documented instance of a performer being killed while performing the gun trick is the case of Chung Ling Soo who was shot dead when a firearm malfunctioned in London in 1918. This event ended the popularity of the bullet catch trick for nearly 70 years. Escape artist and daredevil Harry Houdini wrote a historical account of the illusion and considered adding it to his repertoire but is said to have been afraid to actually perform it.\n\nAmerican mentalist Theodore Annemann presented a dramatic outdoor version of the bullet catch throughout his career in the 1930s until his death in 1942.\n\nGerman magician Ralf Bialla started to perform the bullet catch in the 1950s for a fee of 2,000 DM a performance. He wore bullet-proof glasses, strong gloves on his hands with which he covered parts of his face, and his front teeth were made of steel. A .22 rifle was fired, and the bullet had to go through three glass panes before Bialla caught it with his teeth. He was seriously wounded nine times but survived. He was portrayed in the 1972 documentary film \"Wer schießt auf Ralf Bialla?\". He died in 1975 after falling off a cliff, supposedly because of constant dizziness caused by the injuries.\n\nIn 1964 Nigel Backhurst (who later performed as Nigel Gordon) developed a version of the Bullet Catch using a .22 air rifle, which he performed for his membership audition to the Staffordshire Magical Society. He later wrote an article describing the method used in Abracadabra and continued to perform the effect until 2000 with the Theatre of The Damned.\n\nIn July 1980, Dorothy Dietrich, \"The First Lady of Magic\", was booked to perform her version of the bullet catch for the International Brotherhood of Magicians, and to be featured on the TV show \"Evening Magazine.\" She prepared for several years with the help of mystery entertainer and mentalist Jack London, who performed at her club, The Magic Towne House in New York City. Her version differed in that she allowed an independent committee to buy and bring the bullets under guard; she did not have the bullet marked, since a truly fired bullet would never retain the markings; and she added a special metal cup, since no one could ever truly catch a bullet with their teeth. She also used a pane of unprepared and inspected glass to prove a bullet did in fact leave the rifle. In 1988, she performed the bullet catch in a performance at Donald Trump's Resorts International in Atlantic City for the casino's 10th anniversary. This was shown throughout the world on a TV special called \"Just for the Record, The best of everything\". On another occasion, she performed the trick on the television show \"You Asked for It\", hosted by Rich Little. On yet another occasion, she performed it for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on a show called \"Autobus du Canada\", and received the highest amount ever paid to a magician by Canadian television. She advertised that she was the only woman to perform the bullet catch in her mouth. Dorothy Dietrich is mentioned on the hit show \"House MD\" in a segment about her bullet catch. (Year 8, Segment 8, \"Perils of Paranoia\"). Wilson shows up in House's office with a gun he's found. House swears \"it's not a gun. It's a prop. From Dorothy Dietrich's magic act. Look it up. She's the only woman to ever do the 'Catch a Bullet' trick.\" (In the 1850s, a young woman named Annie Vernone had performed the trick with her sister, and in the 1890s, Adelaide Herrmann, wife of The Great Herrmann, continued to perform her husband's routines after his death; however, they caught it in a plate held in front of them, not in the mouth.) Dietrich advertised a $10,000 reward to anyone who could prove that a bullet did not actually leave the rifle.\n\nIn 2006, the bullet catch trick was tested on the TV show \"MythBusters\". The crew used a slaughtered pig's head to see if it were feasible for a human jaw to withstand the force of a bullet. Despite having stronger teeth than a human, the pig's teeth and jaw were badly damaged. After judging the trick \"busted\", the crew was challenged to design a precisely timed mechanical bullet catching rig. This device was only modestly successful at catching a bullet, and only after the \"jaws\" were switched from a human shaped metal jaw to a longer duckbill one with more surface area. Even with perfect timing aided by ultra-high speed photography, the bullet deteriorated into an almost unrecognizable mass of metal upon impact.\n\nCriss Angel has performed the trick at least twice. In a radio interview with Penn Jillette in February 2006, Angel says there is an unaired performance that was \"so believable\" that the television network A&E would not broadcast it. In this performance, his musician friend Jonathan Davis appeared to fire a high-powered rifle into a metal cup that was custom-made to fit into Criss' mouth. On episode 3 of \"Criss Angel BeLIEve\", Angel performs a version of the trick using a padded glove.\n\nDavid Blaine performs a version of the bullet catch in which he catches the bullet in his mouth with a steel shot glass.\n\nMonalisa Perez, 20, fatally shot her boyfriend in a botched YouTube stunt in July 2017. She pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in December for shooting her boyfriend and father of her two children, 22-year-old Pedro Ruiz III, and was sentenced to six months in jail. Perez, who was pregnant at the time with their second child, fired a bullet into a book that Ruiz was holding against his chest. \n\n\n\n"}

He gained notoriety in February 2019 when he tracked down a British ISIL bride, Shamima Begum.\n\nLoyd grew up in Churt on the Hampshire–Surrey border and attended St Edmund's School, Hindhead, Eton College, and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.\n\nHe went to school for journalism and then went to Bosnia with a vague plan to cover the ongoing war. He started taking pictures but almost by accident an American reporter offered to buy some that he saw. So Loyd became a war photographer supporting himself by selling photos for 50 Deutsche Marks per photograph. Much later Loyd was traveling taking photos with British forces around Travnik, central Bosnia and Herzegovina about 90 km west of Sarajevo. While covering a fire fight a French correspondent who was writing for The Daily Telegraph was wounded by a claymore mine set off by the Croat HVO forces. The wounded correspondent asked Loyd to fill in until the paper could send a replacement, Loyd agreed and so started his first job as a journalist. Afterwards he was put on retainer by \"The Times\" of London and regularly sent to war zones around the world.\n\nAmong the wars he reported were the conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Iraq. Loyd was noted for the risks he took in pursuing his stories. His most recent bylines (as of 15 September 2005) have been from Baghdad, where he has been out on patrol with both the American and Iraqi forces.\n\nLoyd found ISIL bride Shamima Begum in the Al-Hawl camp in Northern Syria. After finding Begum, Loyd taped an interview with her where she stated she had no regrets about moving to ISIL-Controlled territory.\n\n\"My War Gone By, I Miss It So\", is a book based on his experiences in Bosnia and Chechnya. In the book Loyd staggers chapters about war in Bosnia, Chechnya, and boredom tinged with heroin addiction in London.\n\nHe published a second volume of autobiography, \"Another Bloody Love Letter\", in 2007. It covered his experiences in the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nLoyd married Lady Sophia Hamilton, daughter of 5th Duke of Abercorn in 2002 at Baronscourt, the Duke's 5,500 acre (22 km²) ancestral estate, near Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. They were divorced in 2005, on an amicable basis, occasioned by Loyd's frequent absences reporting on wars. He remarried again in 2007 and is now based in Devon with his wife, daughter and stepdaughter.\n\nWhile reporting in Northern Syria (2014), he was shot twice in the leg by Syrian rebels to stop him running away.\n\nHis maternal great-grandfather was Lieutenant General Sir Adrian Carton De Wiart VC, KBE, CB, CMG, DSO (1880–1963). His great-grandfather was not only a highly decorated British soldier, he was also one of the most wounded (eleven times, which included the loss of an eye and a hand). \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1837265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837265", "title": "Weekly Reader", "text": "Weekly Reader\n\nWeekly Reader was a weekly educational classroom magazine designed for children. It began in 1928 as My Weekly Reader. Editions covered curriculum themes in the younger grade levels and news-based, current events and curriculum themed-issues in older grade levels. The publishing company also created workbooks, literacy centers, and picture books for younger grades.\n\nIn 2012, \"Weekly Reader\" ceased operations as an independent publication and merged with its new owner, \"Scholastic News\", due primarily to market pressures to create digital editions as well as decreasing school budgets.\n\nFormerly \"My Weekly Reader\", the \"Weekly Reader\" was a weekly newspaper for elementary school children. It was first published by the American Education Press of Columbus, Ohio, which had been founded in 1902 by Charles Palmer Davis to publish \"Current Events\", a paper for secondary school children. The first issue of \"My Weekly Reader\" appeared on September 21, 1928.\n\nThe first editor was Martha Fulton, who had been hired that summer by Preston Davis, the major owner of the Press, and Harrison Sayre, who became managing editor. Sayre, also the editor of \"World News\", a paper for high school students, had been urged to start a paper for grade schools by teachers he had met in June 1928, while on a sales trip in Indiana. Martha Fulton, who was a friend of Sayre's wife, Mary, and a graduate of Wells College, enjoyed travel and adventure. During World War I, she had been an American Red Cross worker in France. She also had \"a remarkable rapport with children and had lively interests in every direction.\" The lead article was about the boyhoods of Herbert Hoover and Al Smith. There were two shorter articles: \"Wings for Safety\", about street crossing guards; and, \"Sky Medicine\", which was about the healthful qualities of the Sun. The most popular was a letter from \"Uncle Ben\" about a ride in a German glider on Cape Cod. Fulton wrote all these articles. Her sister Peg was the first artist, though soon replaced by her friend Mary Sherwood Wright. Beginning with the third issue, Eleanor Johnson, director of elementary schools in York, Pennsylvania, designed tests for the back page.\n\n\"My Weekly Reader\" was an instant success. By December, circulation was 99,000. In 1929, a second edition was started for younger children, and their combined circulation was 376,000. By 1931, there were four editions, with a combined circulation of 1,099,000.\n\nThe secrets of its early success were the timely news articles that had a children's angle, and the Uncle Ben letters describing new inventions and discoveries that excited children's imaginations. For example, the second issue's lead article, \"A Village Moves to the South Pole\", was about Admiral Byrd's 75-man expedition, their sled dogs, and Paul Siple, a Boy Scout who was with them. Uncle Ben wrote about planned \"Seadromes\", floating airports that airplanes could use to hop across the Atlantic. The third issue, published on October 5, 1928, began with \"How Mother Nature Prepares for Winter\". Uncle Ben described seeing his \"first radio television set\", even though the paper itself had yet to print even a photograph—illustrations for the \"Reader\" having only been drawings to date. On October 12, he wrote about Zeppelins, and the first \"Reader\" photographs appeared. They depicted \"Mr. and Mrs. Hoover\" and \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Grandchildren\".\n\nHarrison Sayre, who became president of the American Education Press while remaining managing editor of \"My Weekly Reader\", gave Martha Fulton the major credit for the newspaper's popularity. In his memoirs, Sayre quoted Gertrude Wolff, another editor who shared an office with Fulton: \"As I had had some editorial experience, she at times sought my advice on minor details, but the conception and execution of those first issues were hers alone. With her imagination, enthusiasm, intuitive understanding of a child's world, she sensed what would appeal to her young readers. Her very personal stamp on the new publication distinguished the succeeding issues during her years as editor.\"\n\nAs the new editions for upper and lower grades were added, Fulton remained the principal writer, even after her marriage in 1930 (to Clarence L. Sager, a New York City lawyer) and her moves to New York City and Old Greenwich, Connecticut. Sayre remembered that Fulton wrote for the papers for 12 years, adding that \"men of the composing room...testify that with her square, legible, longhand copy, she never missed a deadline.\"\n\nOther people who were important to the newspaper's early years were Laura E. Zirbes, a reading expert at the Ohio State University laboratory school, and Dr. Charles H. Judd of the University of Chicago, who introduced Sayre to Dr. William S. Gray, who in turn supplied Fulton with graded vocabulary lists. In 1930, Eleanor Johnson moved from York to Lakewood, Ohio, where she was assistant superintendent of schools until 1934, when she moved to Columbus and later became a managing editor.\n\nIn 1934, a fifth edition was added for the fifth and sixth grades. The price was twenty cents per semester. Circulation continued to rise, passing two million in 1942. Many people still fondly remember the papers they read as children and how they looked forward to Friday afternoons when their teachers handed out the latest issue.\n\nIn 1949, the American Education Press was sold to Wesleyan University and became American Education Publications, a division of the Wesleyan University Press. Editorial offices were moved to Middletown, Connecticut, but printing continued to be done in Columbus, Ohio. There were then six editions, one for each elementary grade, with a total circulation of 4,269,000. Total circulation of AEP papers was 5,605,000. In 1965, Wesleyan sold American Education Publications to the Xerox Corporation. By then, there was also a kindergarten edition. Eleanor Johnson was editor-in-chief of all editions. In later years, there were other owners, including the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Field Publications.\n\nA pre-kindergarten edition was added in 1980. There were also curriculum-specific magazines for middle and high school students, including areas such as health, science, careers, reading, and writing.\n\nWeekly Reader Publishing, which began with the publication of the first \"Current Events\" on May 20, 1902, celebrated its 100th birthday in 2002.\n\nAt various times through its publishing history, the magazine was known as \"My Weekly Reader\" or \"Weekly Reader\".\n\nIn 2007, Weekly Reader Corporation became part of The Reader's Digest Association, based in Chappaqua, New York. \"Weekly Reader\"s main office was relocated from Stamford, Connecticut, to Chappaqua at the end of May 2007. Financial difficulties marred the publication during its time under Reader's Digest ownership; the magazine made efforts to launch an online presence for the magazine but were unable to secure the funds from the parent organization to do so, a factor in the magazine's decline.\n\nIn February 2012, \"Weekly Reader\" was acquired by Scholastic, which operated the competing \"Scholastic News\". Scholastic announced that it would be shutting down \"Weekly Reader\" publication and moving some of its staff to \"Scholastic News\". Following the completion of the merger, the merged magazines are:\n\nOne of the best-known events in the magazine's history is its quadrennial \"Weekly Reader Student Presidential Election Poll\". The poll is an educational exercise in which \"Weekly Reader\"-subscribing teachers conduct mock elections to find their students' preference for president. Teachers tabulate the results, then send them to \"Weekly Reader\". (Since the 2000, the surveys have been developed with, and tabulated by, the Zogby International polling organization.) This survey of students in grades K through 12 began in 1956, when readers chose Dwight Eisenhower over Adlai Stevenson.\n\nThe poll has now been conducted 14 times, most recently in 2008, and the students have voted for the person who became president 13 out of 14 times. The exception was in 1992, when George H.W. Bush garnered more votes than Bill Clinton. Third-party candidate Ross Perot, whose presence on the national ballot was important during the actual election, was not on the \"Weekly Reader\" ballot that year.\n\nIn 2005, Weekly Reader Publishing's literary magazine, \"Read\", launched \"Word\", a blog that features student writing and other literary news. It also offers interactive opportunities for reading and writing, including its \"What's Your Story?\" program, which features \"The Weekly Writer\", where students can help authors such as Stephen King and R. L. Stine finish an original story. \"Read\" magazine has pioneered \"electronic issues\" around literary themes, including \"Canterbury Tales\", William Shakespeare, and Edgar Allan Poe; these interactive websites incorporate video and film, music and sound effects, rap renditions and flash animation. In the 2009-2010 school year, the company extended these \"e-issues\" to four other \"Weekly Reader\" publications, including \"Weekly Reader\" editions 3 and Senior (4-6 grades), \"Current Events\" and \"Current Science\" magazines.\n\n"}

It is used mostly for American football games. The stadium is Located at 1085 S. Kimball Ave. in Southlake, Texas, the stadium serves Carroll ISD, and is the home of the Carroll Senior High School Dragons football team. The stadium was used by the Major League Soccer club Dallas Burn for the 2003 season, after having used the Cotton Bowl since its founding in 1996.\n\nThe stadium was built in 2001 and the first game held at the stadium was on September 7, 2001, an American football game against the Haltom Buffaloes. The final cost of the stadium was in the range of between $18 million and $19 million. The stadium shares land with the Transportation Offices for Carroll ISD. Before 2003, the stadium could seat 8,000 people. When the Dallas Burn Soccer Club terminated their lease with Carroll ISD, they left bleachers that they had assembled in the East endzone. The new capacity is approximately 11,000 people. The endzone bleachers are home to the Carroll Dragon Band and the Emerald Belle Drill Team at home games. The Press Box is accessed via elevator and has two floors. The second floor houses operations and coach booths. The first floor houses administration and scouting personnel. The playing surface is artificial and encompasses many draining features due to how easily the concourse can flood in heavy rains. In 2006, the home parking lot was doubled in size due to expected population growth. As of August 2006, the Carroll ISD school board voted to hold all future graduation ceremonies for graduating seniors of Carroll Senior High at Dragon Stadium. The decision spurred a lot of controversy due to possible weather issues and heat concerns.\n\nIn 2006, Under Armour filmed part of a popular commercial called \"Click-Clack\" at Dragon Stadium.

He was also seen as one of the first people of a growing group of revolutionaries (largely anarchist) who subscribed to the doctrine of the \"propaganda of the deed\", which would later take the life of many governmental figures. \n\nHenry grew up in a liberal, aristocratic family with anarchist sympathies. They were exiled to Spain for a time because his father, Fortune Henry, was a communard (a supporter of the 1871 Paris Commune). As a result, Henry was born in Barcelona and regaled from an early age with stories of state oppression. These anti-state attitudes were confirmed when the Spanish authorities confiscated the Henry family's property due to their political beliefs. Henry's father was forced to take a miserable factory job and died of mercury poisoning when Henry was only 10 years old. The family returned to France and Henry's brother, an anarchist, eventually helped him establish connections with French revolutionary circles. Henry passed the writing portion of the entrance exam for the prestigious École Polytechnique, but he failed his oral exams and went on to find work as a trainee for an engineering firm.\n\nHenry was furious over the state execution of fellow anarchist Auguste Vaillant. Motivated by the French Third Republic's endemic political corruption, Vaillant carried out a bomb attack on the French Chamber of Deputies on 9 December 1893. Although there were no fatalities, twenty deputies were injured. Henry took it upon himself to avenge Vaillant's death.\nHe saw the café as a representation of the bourgeoisie itself and his intent was to kill as many people as possible in the bombing. When brought to trial for these acts, he was asked by the courts why he had needlessly harmed so many innocent people, to which he replied, \"…there are no innocent bourgeois\", adding that his acts caused the \"insolent triumphs\" of the bourgeoisie to be shattered, and \"its golden calf would shake violently on its pedestal, until the final blow knocks it into the gutter and pools of blood.\"\n\nThis was not Henry's first terrorist act; already on November 8, 1892, he had placed a time bomb at the offices of the Carmaux Mining Company, which had exploded when the police removed it, killing five officers in the commissariat on the rue des Bons-enfants. Indeed, after his arrest for the Terminus bombing, Henry took credit for a series of other bombings in Paris, and in his apartment was found material to make many more explosive devices.\n\nHenry was executed by guillotine on 21 May 1894. His last words were reputed to be \"\"Courage, camarades! Vive l'anarchie!\"\"\n\nI became an anarchist only recently. It was no longer ago than around mid-1891 that I threw myself into the revolutionary movement. Previously, I had lived in circles wholly permeated with the established morality. I had been accustomed to respecting and even cherishing the principles of the nation, family, authority and property.\n\nBut those educating the present generation all too often forget one thing – that life, indiscreet with its struggles and setbacks, its injustices and iniquities, sees to it that the scales are removed from the eyes of the ignorant and that they are opened to reality. Which was the case with me, as it is with everyone. I had been told that this life was easy and largely open to intelligent, vagarious people, and experience showed me that only cynics and lackeys can get a good seat at the banquet.\n\nI had been told that society’s institutions were founded on justice and equality, and all around me I could see nothing but lies and treachery. Everyday I was disabused further. Everywhere I went, I witnessed the same pain in some, the same delights in others. It did not take me long to realize that the same great words that I had been raised to venerate: honor, devotion, duty were merely a mask hiding the most shameful turpitude. \n\nThe factory-owner amassing a huge fortune on the back of the labor of his workers who lacked everything was an upright gentleman. The deputy, the minister whose hands were forever outstretched for bribes were committed to the public good. The officer testing his new model rifle on seven-year-old children had done his duty well, and in open parliament the premier offered him his congratulation. Everything I could see turned my stomach and my mind fastened on criticism of social organization. The criticism has been voiced too often to need rehearsing by me. Suffice it say that I turned into an enemy of a society which I held to be criminal. \n\nMomentarily attracted by socialism, I wasted no time in distancing myself from that party. My love of liberty was too great, my regard for individual initiative too great, my repudiation for feathering one’s nest too definite for me to enlist in the numbered army of the fourth estate. Also, I saw that, essentially, socialism changes the established order not one jot. It retains the authoritarian principle, and this principle, despite what supposed free-thinkers may say about it, is nothing but an ancient relic of the belief in a higher power. \n\n(...)In the merciless war that we have declared on the bourgeoisie, we ask no mercy. We mete out death and we must face it. For that reason I await your verdict with indifference. I know that mine will not be the last head you will sever (...) You will add more names to the bloody roll call of our dead. \n\nHanged in Chicago, beheaded in Germany, garroted in Xerez, shot in Barcelona, guillotined in Montbrison and in Paris, our dead are many; but you have not been able to destroy anarchy. Its roots go deep: its spouts from the bosom of a rotten society that is falling apart; it is a violent backlash against the established order; it stands for the aspirations to equality and liberty which have entered the lists against the current authoritarianism. It is everywhere. That is what makes it indomitable, and it will end by defeating you and killing you.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1837353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837353", "title": "GameKing", "text": "GameKing\n\nGameKing is a brand of handheld game consoles, designed and developed by Timetop in 2003, for the Hong Kong consumer market. The brand has three consoles, the GameKing I, the GameKing II and the GameKing III. A fourth console, the Handy Game, was produced by Timetop and shares some branding, but otherwise has little to do with the GameKing franchise.\n\nThe original GameKing console is a 8-bit handheld game console. It is based around a 65C02 CPU running at 6.0 MHz.\nIt is fashioned to look like Nintendo's Game Boy Advance and comes in a wide array of vivid pastel colours, either opaque or transparent, and uses 2 AAA size batteries. The original GameKing lacks a backlit screen, a feature which has been added in its \"successor\", the GameKing II.\n\nThe consoles have above-average sound circuitry capable of multi-channel music and digital sound playback, but a comparably low quality greyscale LCD screen, only supporting four shades of grey and having a very low (48 by 32 pixels) resolution, combined with a slow refresh rate, poor readability and adjustments, compared to the original Game Boy.\n\nGames can be compared to some of the earlier built-in cell phone games (pre Java games), while their playing speed (scrolling etc.) and audio is far superior (multi-channel music and digitized samples and voices are quite common in GameKing games).\n\nIt is unclear whether the machine uses a traditional programmable sound generator or relies only on digital samples for music and sound effects. Many of its games have soundtracks consisting of short audio samples with a sampling rate of 8 kHz, as opposed to games on other systems such as the Game Boy where sound is generated by a custom programmable sound generator.\n\nAccording to Brian Provinciano's reverse engineering of the GameKing, most GameKing games heavily rely on bitmap rather than tile-based rendering of the screen, e.g. most levels in its platform and shoot 'em up games are in reality large 4-colour bitmaps, instead of using the most common method of graphic tiles and tile maps, like in most other game consoles and arcade games. This was probably done for economic reasons (the CPU alone can handle all graphics easily, at that resolution) and easy development of the games, apart from the objectively low resolution of the screen. While such a scheme seems to work, it has the disadvantage of using cartridge space inefficiently, so that e.g. most platform games are limited to 3 levels. At this point, it is unknown if the GameKing uses some form of sprite rendering, although this is probably unlikely and unnecessary.\n\nThe GameKing II, on the other hand, is fashioned to look like Sony's PlayStation Portable, comes in more sober colors (either black, grey, white or aqua - and although not shown on the packaging, yellow ones do also exist), and uses 3 AAA size batteries, of which only 2 are used to actually power up the GameKing's hardware, while the third one serves to power up both its built-in audio amplifier (a bit more powerful than the one on the original GameKing) and its backlit LCD screen (which can be turned on and off at will, depending on external lighting conditions, thus saving power). The unit can still work with 2 batteries, only with no sound and no backlighting available.\n\nAlso, the GameKing II has a fixed color background picture for its LCD screen, only visible when the backlighting is switched on. This is probably to give the false impression of having a colour LCD screen, as implied on its box.\n\nThe picture may vary between various GameKing models, however it has a mostly negative effect on screen readability when the backlighting is turned on.\n\nThis background picture can also be removed or replaced simply by opening the machine and removing the small plastic transparency behind the LCD. Removing it makes using the backlighting much more effective.\n\nThis model would also be the last in the Gameking line to have the text \"3in1\" stamped above the screen.\n\n\"Notes: Likewise with the GK, no page exists for the GKII, but the Chinese site still lists the machine as product code GM-219.\"\n\nHowever, the two models are fully hardware compatible, can use the same games/cartridges, both have volume and contrast controls and use the same LCD screen. Also, they both have an external DC power supply 3.5 mm minijack plug; however, the plug is not labeled as such, and its function is only slightly hinted at in the units' manuals. The GameKing requires 3V DC, while the GameKing2 requires 4.5V DC with the peculiarity of needing to keep at least one battery in the unit in order to have sound and backlighting.\n\nTimeTop quietly released a third GameKing machine, called the 'GameKing III' or GM-220 sometime in 2005. While early advertisements showed the GameKing III with the same \"false color\" background picture as the GameKing I and II, which would indicate that the system is actually black and white like the previous GameKing models,the GM-220 is in fact full colour. Another distinction of the GM-220 is that unlike its predecessors, the Gameking I and II, which were promoted and marketed worldwide, the Gameking III was not actively distributed outside of Asia, making it much less common than the earlier models. In 2005, many websites initially reported the device as \"coming soon\", and it is not known why Timetop eventually decided to offer only a limited release. \n\nAlthough accurate technical information is hard to obtain, it seems to be a handheld console using a 64-colour (or grey shades) LCD or TFT screen, although little else is known about it. It was available in black, silver, dark violet, and blue.\n\nThe resolution doesn't seem enhanced compared to an original GameKing, and \"classic\" GameKing cartridges are automatically colorized, while games especially developed for it allegedly make use of the full color palette, which for the moment remains unknown. The site claimed a total of 12 carts for this system. If the built-in game is included, 8 titles are known as of 2010.\n\nA new design for the GKIII was placed in April 2006 at the Timetop site, and later removed (see GM-221, below).\n\nA second design for the Gameking III also exists which combines elements from the GM-219 with the GM-220. The Button design and layout is from the GM-220 design, with the \"A\" button being distinctly larger than the \"B\" button, but the overall form is obviously inspired from Sony's PSP design. Several colors are shown on the back of the box, green and orange for example, however only two colors, a black edition and a white edition are confirmed to exist.\n\nThe GM-222 sports an original design, which does not borrow much from previous models. Even though it is sequenced later than the other consoles in the Gameking line, and therefore one would expect more advanced hardware, it is in fact a redesigned Gameking II. Moreover, besides returning to the lo-res black and white screen, the back-light has also been removed (notice however that the box for the GM-221 and GM-222 both show exactly the same false color screen shot, despite the two machines vastly different capabilities). It is not known why Timetop choice to release the GM-222 in this fashion, although renderings exist that show this design was intended at some point to be a full color model. It was available in charcoal, blue, and green.\n\nA distinct Timetop console exists which uses NES compatible hardware rather than the proprietary hardware of the other Gameking consoles, and also has an integrated TV output. While early mockups indicated this handheld was considered part of the Gameking line, Timetop eventually removed the gameking branding from this edition prior to its release, replacing it with \"Timetop LTPS Handy Game\" ( ironically, \"handy-game\" was the working title EPYX coined in 1987 for what would become the Atari Lynx). The console comes with 25 built-in games and is also able to accept cartridges, however their size and connectors are different from (and incompatible with) previous Gameking consoles. The game selection includes games typically found on NES clones, like \"1942\", \"Pooyan\" or \"Dig Dug\", as well as graphic ROM hacks of famous NES games (for example, using Blue's Journey graphics with Adventure Island).\n\nThe GM-228 was available in a large variety of colors with some faceplaces containing very elaborate designs. Colors included silver, black, green, yellow, and pink.\n\nThe console has a small selection of known games (38), being 3 built in and 35 in carts, although 37 games were said to be available by TimeTop. Most games are clones of famous NES, C64 or Atari 2600 titles, with heavily dropped graphics. The games come in cartridges resembling the original Game Boy ones, with a typical size of 128KB, although 4-in-1 cartridges are available, containing 4 normal GameKing games plus a selection menu, and have a maximum size of 512KB.\n\nBoth the GameKing and GameKing II come with three built in games.\n\nHere follows an incomplete list of known games.\nPlease note that many GameKing games use the same program altering only graphics to create \"new\" games e.g. \"2003\" and \"2004\" are essentially the same game with minor differences. Also, many games have major inconsistencies between the box, manual and in-game title. E.g., \"Lanneret\" becomes \"Hawk\" in the game title, Feichuan becomes \"Shenzhou Liuhao\" in the game,\nor \"Carlo Adventure Legend\" becomes \"Caro\" in-game.\n\n\"Notes: The two previous titles are the only motor or sports games available on the GameKing.\"\n\nGames are generally sold in separate cartridges, but there are 4-in-1 cartridges holding 4 distinct games. Later games seem to be only available in this manner. Also, each 4-in-1 pack comes numbered and higher numbers seem to provide games that are more refined in presentation.\n\nSome of these games found in 4-in-1 cartridges are:\n\nGameKing III machines have a built-in game:\nAt the moment the only known game carts for the GameKing III are:\n\nThe NES-clone version of the GameKing III has its own selection of games, most of them being pirated or unlicensed NES games or variations. These come multi-carts with combinations such as 26in1, 49in1,and 72in1, etc. No HandyGame carts are compatible with any previous model.\n\n"}

In the nearby green valleys of the rivers Samoggia and Lamone there are great number of 18th and 19th century stately homes, set in extensive grounds or preceded by long cypress-lined driveways.\n\nAccording to mythology, the name of the first settlement, \"Faoentia\", had Etruscan and Celtic roots, meaning in Latin \"Splendeo inter deos\" or \"I shine among the gods,\" in modern English.\nThe very name, coming from the Romans who developed this center under the name of Faventia, has become synonymous with ceramics (majolica) in various languages, including French (faïence) and English (faience).\n\nHere Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius defeated populares army of Gnaeus Papirius Carbo in 82 BC.\n\nFrom the second half of the 1st century AD the city flourished considerably as a result of its agricultural propensities and the development of industrial activities such as the production of everyday pottery and brickwork objects and linen textiles.\n\nHere Totila and an Ostrogothic army defeated the Byzantine army in Italy in the Battle of Faventia in 542 CE.\n\nAfter a period of decadence from the 2nd century to the early Middle Ages it regained prosperity from the 8th century on. Around the year 1000 with the government of the Bishops and subsequently in the age of the Comune the city began a long period of richness and building expansion which reached its peak with the rule of the Manfredi family. The first consuls were elected in 1141 and in 1155 a podestà was in charge of government of the city. In the wars between Guelphs and Ghibellines that began in the following years Faenza was at first loyal to the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1178, however, it changed side and entered the Lombard League. The inner disputes anyway favoured acquisition of power by Maghinardo Pagano, who remained podestà and \"capitano del popolo\" for several years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 14th century the Guelph Manfredi began a rule over Faenza that was to last for almost two centuries. The peak of splendour was reached under Carlo II Manfredi, in the second half of the century, when the city centre was renewed. In 1488 Galeotto Manfredi was assassinated by his wife: his son Astorre III succeeded him, but was in turn killed in Rome as a prisoner of Cesare Borgia, who had captured Faenza in 1501.\n\nAfter a brief period of Venetian domination Faenza became part of the Papal States until 1797.\n\nFaenza lost 1,322 of its citizens during World War II. After months of bombings and a bloody battle was finally liberated by the New Zealand Army (2nd New Zealand Division) on 17 December 1944.\n\nFaenza's architectural attractions are concentrated in the two contiguous main squares: Piazza del Popolo, lined by two double order porticoed wings, and Piazza della Libertà.\n\n\n\nAmong the other monuments of the historic centre are \"Palazzo Milzetti\", the richest and most significant Neoclassical building in the region, and the \"Teatro Masini\" (1780–1787). In the nearby, the \"Villa Case Grandi dei Ferniani\" has a collection of 18th and 19th century Faenza ceramics.\n\nGrotta Tanaccia Karstic Park and the Carnè Natural Park, a vast green area with a visitor’s centre and refreshments, are also of great interest, characterized by a typical landscape of dolinas, ravines and swallow holes.\nFaenza is home to the International Museum of Ceramics. The museum houses pieces from all over the world and from every epoch, from classical amphoras to the works of Chagall and Picasso, and there is a rich section dedicated to Faenza pottery in the golden age of the Renaissance. Other interesting art collections are located in the Municipal Art Gallery, the Diocese Museum, the Bendandi Museum and the Manfredi Library. The historic production of Faenza majolica is recognized worldwide as one of the highest moments of artistic creativity expressed through pottery. The tradition was born from a convergence of favourable conditions: a territory rich in clay, a centuries-old history of political and commercial relations with nearby Tuscany (especially with Florence).\n\nAs a testament to the popularity of the city's majolica through the ages, on 18 August 2006, Quebec Premier Jean Charest announced that Canadian archaeologists had discovered the precise location of Canada's lost first colony of Charlesbourg-Royal, and that a fragment of a decorative Istoriato plate manufactured in Faenza between 1540 and 1550 was found there that could only have belonged to a member of the French aristocracy in the colony.\n\nIn September and October international contemporary and classical ceramic art events draw majolica amateurs, collectors and artists to Faenza from all over the world. In June the \"Palio del Niballo\", a tournament between five horsemen from the districts of the town, re-evokes the magnificence and struggles of Faenza in the Manfredi epoch.\n\nFaenza also houses the annual \"Mexi-talian Convention\", in which Mexican and Italian food and drinks are served alike at the local market; this event usually occurs in May, as part of a Cinco de Mayo celebration.\n\nTypical regional dishes include home-made tagliatelle, cappelletti, lasagna and strozzapreti with the Romagna meat sauce. Two of the best restaurants in Faenza are Spaghetti Notte and Casa Spadoni.\n\nThe Botanical Gardens, next to the Civic Natural Science Museum with its collections, houses more than 170 species of plants indigenous to Romagna. There is about of public urban green area. The Bucci Park, created in 1968, has an area of about of undulating land, green meadows and fish-rich waters, with species of birds including wild duck, storks and swans.\n\nThe Florence–Faenza marathon, a demanding long-distance race held during the last weekend in May, attracts athletes of all nationalities.\n\nFaenza is home to the Formula One racing team Scuderia AlphaTauri, formerly Scuderia Toro Rosso, formerly Minardi. Minardi was one of the last small, independent constructors in Formula One, and was bought by Red Bull in 2005, continuing to be based in Faenza.\n\nFaenza railway station, at Piazza Cesare Battisti, forms part of the Bologna–Ancona railway. It is also a terminus of two secondary railways, linking Faenza with Ravenna and Florence, respectively. Opened in 1893, it replaced an earlier station, which had been opened in 1861 at a location to the east of the present station, near what is now Via Caldesi.\n\nFaenza is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1837406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837406", "title": "Neoshamanism", "text": "Neoshamanism\n\nNeoshamanism refers to \"new\" forms of shamanism, or methods of seeking visions or healing. Neoshamanism comprises an eclectic range of beliefs and practices that involve attempts to attain altered states and communicate with a spirit world. Neoshamanic systems may not resemble traditional forms of shamanism. Some have been invented by individual practitioners, though many borrow or gain inspiration from a variety of different indigenous cultures. In particular, indigenous cultures of the Americas have been influential.\n\nThe word \"shaman\" originates from the Evenki word \"\"\"šamán\"\"\". The Tungusic term was subsequently adopted by Russians interacting with the indigenous peoples of Siberia, and then applied very broadly by western anthropologists to many, diverse spiritual systems that share some kind of practice of calling upon, and mediating with, spirit beings.\n\nNeoshamanism is not a single, cohesive belief system, but a collective term for many philosophies and activities. However, certain generalities may be drawn between adherents. Most believe in spirits and pursue contact with the \"spirit-world\" in altered states of consciousness which they achieve through drumming, dance, or the use of entheogens. Most systems might be described as existing somewhere on the animism/pantheism spectrum. Some neoshamans were not trained by any traditional shaman or member of any American indigenous culture, but rather learn independently from books and experimentation. Many attend New Age workshops and retreats, where they study a wide variety of ideas and techniques, both new and old.\n\nSome members of traditional, indigenous cultures and religions are critical of neoshamanism, asserting that it represents an illegitimate form of cultural appropriation, or that it is nothing more than a ruse by fraudulent spiritual leaders to disguise or lend legitimacy to fabricated, ignorant, and/or unsafe elements in their ceremonies. \nAccording to York (2001) one difference between neoshamanism and traditional shamanism is the role of fear. Neoshamanism and its New Age relations tend to dismiss the existence of evil, fear, and failure. \"In traditional shamanism, the shaman’s initiation is an ordeal involving pain, hardship and terror. New Age, by contrast is a religious perspective that denies the ultimately [sic] reality of the negative, and this would devalue the role of fear as well.\"\n\nThe 2011 United Kingdom census made it possible to write in a description of one's own choosing for \"Religion\". The figures for England and Wales show that from just over 80,000 people self-identifying as Pagan, 650 wrote in the description \"Shamanism\".\n\n\"Core Shamanism\", which formed the foundations for most contemporary neoshamanism, is a system of practices synthesized, invented and promoted by Michael Harner in the 1980s, based on his reading of anthropological texts about indigenous peoples in the Americas, primarily the Plains Indians. Harner, who was not himself indigenous to the Americas, asserted that the ways of several North American tribes share \"core\" elements with those of the Siberian shamans. Many non-Native American readers believe that Harner's ideas were representative of actual traditional indigenous ceremonies, when they were not actually very accurate according to subsequent critics. Some members of these tribes assert that Harner's ideas or representations were not in any way accurate, nor do they call their spiritual leaders \"shamans\".\n\nHarner professes to describe common elements of \"shamanic\" practice found among indigenous people world-wide, having stripped those elements of specific cultural content so as to render them \"accessible\" to contemporary Western spiritual seekers. Harner also founded the Foundation for Shamanic Studies which claims to aid indigenous people preserve or even re-discover their own spiritual knowledge.\n\nCore shamanism does not hold a fixed belief system, but instead focuses on the practice of \"shamanic journeying\" and may also rely on the novels of Carlos Castaneda. Specific practices include the use of rapid drumming in an attempt to attain \"the shamanic state of consciousness\", ritual dance, and attempted communication with animal tutelary spirits, called \"power animals\" by Harner.\"\n\n\"Power animal\" is a concept that was introduced in 1980 by Michael Harner in \"The Way of the Shaman\". While Harner took inspiration from his study of animistic beliefs in many different cultures, his concept of power animals is much like the familiar spirits of European occultism, which aid the occultist in their metaphysical work.\n\nThe use of this term has been incorporated into the New Age movement, where it is often mistaken for being the same as a totem in some indigenous cultures. The concept has also entered popular culture in various forms, such as in the 1999 film (and earlier novel) \"Fight Club\", when the narrator attends a cancer support group. During a creative visualization exercise, he is told to see himself entering a cave where he will meet his power animal. When he does, he imagines a penguin is speaking to him.\n\nCritics Daniel C. Noel and Robert J. Wallis see Harner's teachings as based on cultural appropriation and a misrepresentation of the various cultures by which he claims to have been inspired. Geary Hobson sees the New Age use of the term \"shamanism\" as a cultural appropriation of Native American culture by white people who have distanced themselves from their own history. Critics such as Noel and Wallis believe Harner's work, in particular, laid the foundations for massive exploitation of indigenous cultures by \"plastic shamans\" and other cultural appropriators. Note, however, that Noel does believe in \"authentic western shamanism\" as an alternative to neoshamanism.\n\n\n"}

His good voice enabled him to study as a choirboy at the Church of Saint-Sauveur in Aix-en-Provence, which he left at the age of 15 with a sound knowledge of music, and a scholarship which enabled him to study literature at a Jesuit college. However, after three years, he abandoned these studies to pursue a musical career.\n\nHe first obtained a position in the orchestra of the theatre at Aix. In 1829, he became \"maître de chapelle\" at Saint-Sauveur, but realised that to complete his musical education he needed to study at Paris. An allowance of 50 francs per month from a rich uncle made this possible.\n\nIn Paris in 1830 he convinced Luigi Cherubini, the director of the Conservatoire, to enroll him as a pupil: despite his reservations, Cherubini recognised the talent shown by David's choral setting of \"Beatus vir\". Despite the sudden withdrawal of his uncle's subsidy, David's studies, with Fétis and others, continued successfully.\n\nOn leaving the Conservatoire, David was caught up in the Saint-Simonian movement, for which he became a great enthusiast. The Saint-Simonians held music to be an important art, and David wrote much music for them, including a number of hymns. After the suppression of the movement in 1832, David joined with a number of adepts who visited the Middle East. This also proved a source of strong inspiration, leading eventually to his greatest success, the symphonic ode \"Le désert\" of 1844.\n\nReturning to Paris in 1833, he wrote a number of \"romances\", and instrumental music including three symphonies (in F major, E major and C minor, composed in 1837, 1838 and 1849); by 1838/39 he was successful enough to be able to arrange public performances of his works. With \"Le Désert\" he was acknowledged by the public and the critics as a significant force. The \"Revue et gazette musicale\" announced, the morning after its premiere, \"A great composer has been born amongst us\". To relieve his substantial debts, however, the composer sold the rights to his masterpiece for a relatively small sum.\n\nDavid wrote a number of operas, of which the most notable are \"Christophe Colomb\" (1847), \"La perle du Brésil\" (1851), \"Herculanum\" (1859), and \"Lalla-Roukh\" (1862). Amongst his oratorios are \"Moïse au Sinaï\" ('Moses on Sinai') (1846), and \"Eden\" (1848).\n\nDavid became a member of the Légion d'honneur in 1862 and was given a civil pension. On the death of Berlioz in 1869, he took his place in the Institut de France. He died in Le Pecq (now Saint-Germain-en-Laye) in the département Yvelines, close to Paris, in 1876.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1837464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837464", "title": "Fernando de Herrera", "text": "Fernando de Herrera\n\nFernando de Herrera (~1534–1597), called \"El Divino\", was a 16th-century Spanish poet and man of letters. He was born in Seville. Much of what is known about him comes from \"Libro de descripción de verdaderos retratos de illustres y memorables varones\" (Book of the Description of the True Portraits of Illustrious and Memorable Men) (1599) by Francisco Pacheco.\n\nAlthough Herrera's family was only moderately wealthy, they were highly esteemed in Seville. During Herrera's lifetime, Seville was a bustling port city from which many transatlantic voyages would embark, and trading took place with countries all over the world. This active atmosphere, however, was somewhat contradictory to Herrera's character. He therefore sought solace from the busy city life through his poetry. However, whereas spending much of his time in seclusion allowed him to concentrate on his work and artistic interests, it also brought him much criticism from others. The academic community, especially Rodrigo Caro and Juan Gutiérrez Rufo, mocked him for his unorthodox ways.\n\nAlthough well-learned and knowledgeable — Herrera was a great admirer of Italian poetry, the classics, and the Bible (all of which influenced his work) — he was never known to have held any academic degree. He admired one Spanish poet in particular, Garcilaso de la Vega, whose style influenced his own poetry. Herrera did not just have an antiquarian interest in knowledge, however; he was interested in current events, especially those related to the military. Evidence of this is seen in his patriotic canciones (songs) in which he expresses feelings toward contemporary military leaders and actions.\n\nTo accommodate his need for refuge, Herrera took minor orders in the Catholic Church and received a benefice in San Andrés, a parish of Seville. However, though Herrera displayed a love for solitude, he was no hermit. Around 1559, he struck up a friendship with Don Álvaro Colón y Portugal, Count of Gelves, and his wife, Doña Leonor de Milán de Córdoba y Aragón. Herrera was frequently invited by the count to attend his tertulia (literary salon), a meeting of an elite literary circle where he would form many friendships with local poets, men of letters, painters, and artists. It was his relationship with Doña Leonor that provided Herrera with his muse. Herrera's love for Doña Leonor inspired his love poems. However, they were never enough to provoke the same feelings in her.\n\nAfter the death of Leonor in 1581, Herrera lost his desire to write further love poetry. In addition, the death of the count in 1582 ended his attendance at the disbanded literary tertulia at the palace. Henceforth, Herrera devoted himself to two major projects: a history of the world up to the death of Charles V and a biography of Thomas More. The writer continued to work up to his death in 1597 at the age of 63.\n\nHerrera's meticulous study and eventual mastery of poetic discourse earned him the name \"el Divino\" (\"the divine one\"), a name given him by Miguel Cervantes, author of \"Don Quixote\". In addition, his knowledge of poetic topics helped him to become one of the leaders of the school of poets to which Herrera belonged in Seville.\n\nThe works of Herrera cover a wide range of subjects, representing his large span of knowledge and interests. Herrera's military poetry (his canciones, or songs), for example, are accounts of contemporary military leaders and events in which Herrera demonstrates his patriotism, loyalty to the Christian faith, and respect for great leaders. Three poems concerning this theme include \"Canción por la Victoria del Señor don Juan\" (Ode to the Victory of Don Juan), written in 1572, where patriotism is displayed in praising the work done by the Spanish navy at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571; \"Canción al señor don Juan de Austria vencedor de los moriscos en las Alpujarras\" (Ode to Don Juan de Austria, Conqueror of the Moors in the Alpujarras), written in 1571, where Herrera celebrates a leader who stopped a Muslim revolt between 1568 and 1571; and \"Canción por la pérdida del Rei don Sebastián\" (Ode to the Defeat of King Sebastian), written in 1579, where the poet commemorates the death of a Portuguese king.\n\nHerrera's love poetry inspired by his muse, the Countess of Gelves, can be divided into two periods. The first, \"Rimas Juventiles\" (Youthful Rhymes), is defined by Herrera's description of love as a blissful state, in which there is neither pain nor suffering; in this state, even the impossible can happen. In the second period, love escapes reality and lives in a world of fantasy and perfection. To this period belongs the \"Poesías\" (Poems), a body of poetry, published in successive editions.\n\nA third major area of Herrera’s work, and one for which he is best known, is related to Garcilaso de la Vega, the Spanish poet and author whom Herrera held in the highest esteem. One of Herrera's most famous works, \"Obras de Garci Lasso con anotaciones de Fernando de Herrera al ilustrissimo i ecelentissimo Señor don Antonio de Guzman, Marques de Ayamonte, Governador del Estado de Milan, i Capitan General de Italia\" (Works of Gracilaso de la Vega with Comments by Fernando de Herrera to the Most Illustrious and Excellent Don Antonio de Guzman, Marques of Ayamonte, Governor of the State of Milan, and Captain General of Italy), written in 1580, displays not only Herrera's admiration for Garcilaso's poetry but also his mastery of the intricate details of said poet's rhythm, choice and order of words, coherency, meter, and the effects they have on the poem as a whole. It is this knowledge which drove Herrera to devote such meticulous attention to his own work.\n\nOther examples of Herrera's work include the translation of Latin and Italian works into Castilian, a biography of Thomas More, and a history of the world. Some of his most well-known works are:\n\n\n\n"}

The team was founded in 2005 as the Edmonton Cracker-Cats and, with their provincial brethren the Calgary Vipers, joined the Northern League as part of that league's attempt to expand its footprint in Canada.\n\nThe Cracker-Cats moved to the Golden Baseball League in 2008 and were sold to Daryl Katz, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers, in 2009. The team adopted the name Capitals after Katz's purchase and also adopted the same colors as their corporate sibling.\n\nThe team last played in 2011 as a member of the North American League.\n\nThe Cracker-Cats began as an expansion team in 2005 as a member of the Northern League. The name \"Cracker-Cats\" is derived from the oil industry term fluid catalytic cracking (\"cat cracking\" for short), which is part of the process of refining crude oil into gasoline by converting high boiling hydrocarbons into smaller molecules. They played the first game of their inaugural season on May 20, 2005, on the road against the Kansas City T-Bones. Their first home game did not take place until one week later when they hosted the Sioux Falls Canaries in front of 7,894 fans.\n\nOn June 13, 2006, a string of bean balls in the first two innings touched off two major brawls between the Cracker-Cats and their provincial rivals, the Calgary Vipers. After Edmonton's Greg Morrison was hit by a Calgary pitch for the fourth time in five games, the Cracker-Cats responded by throwing at two Calgary players. The resulting melee was so violent that the umpires sent both teams off the field, and suspended the game for over an hour to consult with league officials. When the Cracker-Cats refused to return to the field afterward, the game was declared a forfeit and the Vipers were awarded a 9–0 victory even though Edmonton was leading 1–0. As a result of the suspension, Cracker-Cats manager Terry Bevington resigned. The league came down hard on both teams, as both managers and seven players were suspended a total of 79 games. Morrison blamed Calgary manager Mike Busch for the incident, believing that Busch held a grudge after both Morrison and another former Viper, J.P. Fauske defected to the Cracker-Cats after leaving the Vipers after a falling out with the Calgary manager late in the 2005 season.\n\nOn July 18, 2006, Stubby Clapp was named Most Valuable Player of the Northern League All-Star Game. On September 3, 2006, the 'Cats finished their second season six games back in the wild card race and missed the playoffs.\n\nThe 2007 season was a major disappointment. Al Coates, a sports broadcaster, was named general manager of the Edmonton Cracker-Cats for the 2007 season, and despite adding three former Major Leaguers, Ryan Radmanovich, Mike Johnson, and Lou Pote, the 'Cats finished 38–58 and last in the league.\n\nAfter three years in the Northern League, the Cracker-Cats joined the Golden Baseball League on October 24, 2007. This occurred just after the rival Vipers jumped to the league. On June 30, 2008, The 'Cats set a new attendance record of 8,676 fans against the Vipers.\n\nOn August 22, 2008, the Cracker-Cats clinched a playoff spot by defeating the Orange County Flyers 13–4 and won the second half. They faced the Vipers, who won the first half, in the first-ever North Division Championship Series, but were swept by Calgary 3 games to 0.\n\nOn February 4, 2009, the Cracker-Cats were purchased for $400,000 by Katz Baseball Corp. led by Daryl Katz who also owns the National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers. A new name was drawn from a contest, renaming the franchise the \"Capitals\".\n\nThe Capitals were one of six former GBL teams to join the newly formed North American League in 2010 and began play in 2011. The Capitals won the league championship in the inaugural season of the NAL. On February 21, 2012 the Katz group announced that the Edmonton Capitals have withdrawn from the North American League, citing that only four teams had registered for the 2012 season. They also went dark for the 2013 season after being unable to find a new league to play in. They were exploring options for the 2014 baseball season but it never happened.\n\n\n"}

F. R. Chesney was born there, on 16 March 1789.\n\nLord Rawdon gave the boy a cadetship at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and he was gazetted to the Royal Artillery in 1805. \nBut though he rose to be lieutenant-general and colonel-commandant of the 14th brigade Royal Artillery (1864), and general in 1868, Chesney's memory lives not for his military record, but for his connection with the Suez Canal, and with the exploration of the Euphrates valley, which started with his being sent out to Constantinople in the course of his military duties in 1829, and his making a tour of inspection in Egypt and Syria. \nIn 1830, after taking command of 7th Company, 4th Battalion Royal Artillery in Malta, he submitted a report on the feasibility of making a Suez Canal. This was the original basis of Lesseps’ great undertaking (in 1869 Lesseps greeted him in Paris as the “father “ of the canal); and in 1831 he introduced to the home government the idea of opening a new overland route to India, by a daring and adventurous journey along the Euphrates valley from Anah to the Persian Gulf. \nReturning home, Acting Lt Colonel Chesney (as he then was) busied himself to get support for the latter project, to which the East India Company’s board was favourable; and in 1835 he was sent out in command of a small expedition, on which he took a number of soldiers from 7th Company RA and for which Parliament voted £20,000, in order to test the navigability of the Euphrates. \n\nAfter encountering immense difficulties, from the opposition of the Egyptian pasha, and from the need of transporting two steamers (one of which, the \"Tigris\", was subsequently lost) in sections from the Mediterranean over the hilly country to the river, they successfully arrived by water at Bushire in the summer of 1836, and proved Chesney's view to be a practicable one. \nIn the middle of 1837, he returned to England, and was given the Royal Geographical Society’s gold medal, having meanwhile been to India to consult the authorities there; but the preparation of his two volumes on the expedition (published in 1850) was interrupted by his being ordered out in 1843 to command the artillery at Hong Kong. \n\nIn 1847, his period of service was completed, and he went home to Ireland, to a life of retirement; but both in 1856 and again in 1862 he went out to the East to take a part in further surveys and negotiations for the Euphrates valley railway scheme, which, however, the government would not take up, in spite of a favourable report from the House of Commons committee in 1871. In 1868 he published a further volume of narrative on his Euphrates expedition. He died on January 30, 1872.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1837519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837519", "title": "Morro Castle (Havana)", "text": "Morro Castle (Havana)\n\nMorro Castle (), named after the three biblical Magi, is a fortress guarding the entrance to Havana bay in Havana, Cuba. The design was drawn up by the Italian engineer Battista Antonelli; originally under the control of Spain, the fortress was captured by the British in 1762, and was returned to the Spanish under treaty terms a year later.\n\nThe Morro fortress in Havana shares its name with structures in Santiago de Cuba and the Castillo de San Felipe del Morro in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In this case, the Spanish \"morro\" means a rock which is very visible from the sea and therefore serves as a navigational landmark. Perched on the promontory on the opposite side of the harbor from Old Havana, it can be viewed from miles around as it dominates the port entrance. Built initially in 1589 in response to raids on Havana harbor, el Morro protected the mouth of the harbor with a chain being strung out across the water to the fort at La Punta.\n\nIt first saw action in 1762, while under the command of Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla. The British expedition against Cuba under Lord Albemarle landed in Cojimar to the east of Havana and attacked the fortress from its landward side. The fort fell when the British successfully mined one of its bastions. When the British handed the island back in 1763 to Spain, the fortress at La Cabaña was built to prevent this from happening again.\n\nInside the gates is an exhibition on the lighthouses of Cuba – El Morro once housed a school for lighthouse keepers. There was actually a watchtower here until the British blew it up during their successful siege in 1762. The Faro Castillo del Morro lighthouse was added in 1846.\n\nThe cannons around the fort are now badly rusted, but the walls are well preserved. The fort has central barracks up to four stories high. A small underwater archeology exhibition is also located here. Noteworthy are the old latrines and their chute into the sea, as are the two sets of doors and the drawbridge mechanism. The current harbor master's office is still housed in the fortress. A plaque dedicated by the ambassador of the United Kingdom commemorates the 1762 siege, and a small memorial is located between two strong powder rooms in the northeast bastion.\n\nA small turret at the end of the wall offers views of the sea crashing onto the rocks 20 meters below, and of the huge dry moat. The opposite side of the moat holds more modern guns and cannons, La Bateria de Velasco, and offers a sweeping view down to Cojimar.\nThe complex is now part of a historical park, along with the El Morro fortress, and houses several museums open to the public. Every night a cannon is fired at 9pm, the so-called \"\"El Cañonazo de las 9\"\" is a leftover custom kept from colonial times signaling the closure of the city gates.\n\nMorro Castle can be seen in the background of John Singleton Copley's oil painting \"Watson and the Shark\" (1778).\n\nMorro Castle appears in the movie \"The Ghost Breakers\" (1940), in the background as Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard enter the harbor by ship.\n\nThe climactic scenes from \"The Big Boodle\" (1957) starring Errol Flynn were shot at Morro Castle in pre-Castro Cuba.\n\nDuring his life, the Castro regime imprisoned the Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas (1943-1990) at El Morro Castle for criticism of the government. The film version of Arenas's autobiography, \"Before Night Falls\" (2000), starring Javier Bardem, features scenes set in El Morro Castle prison. (A fortress in Mexico City doubled for the prison, since the filmmakers were not allowed to film in Cuba.)\n\nThe Cuban writer José Antonio Echeverría (1815-1885) published his only novel, \"Antonelli\" (1839), in the periodical \"La Cartera Cubana\" in three parts. An historical novel in the tradition of Walter Scott, \"Antonelli\" describes the love triangle among Antonelli, a Spanish soldier, and the planter's daughter they both love. Morro Castle is the setting for many of the book's events, including its tragic finale.\n"}

The last issue of the magazine was #14, published in 1998. The magazine had an international circulation, distributed primarily by Fine Print, an Austin-based company that focused on 'zine distribution.\n\n\"FringeWare Review\" was established in 1994. The publication was co-founded by Jon Lebkowsky and Paco Nathan, with art director Monte McCarter and assistant editor Tiffany Lee Brown. The magazine's parent company, FringeWare, Inc., was the first company built on Internet community (the FringeWare email list, later referred to as the FringeWare News Network), and probably the first to use web technology when it appeared. FringeWare also had presences on The WELL and on Illuminati Online's Metaverse, which was conceived as a commercial multiuser object-oriented environment (MOO). Fringe Ware quickly built an international reputation through the Internet and the magazine. As online communities and the Internet spread in popularity during the 1990s, Fringe Ware became known as an early forebear to online commerce sites such as Amazon_company and to magazines such as \"Wired\", which named Fringe Ware Review in its Top 10 List.\n\nThe company also owned an independent bookstore in Austin, Texas, that was an underground culture-hub for the city of Austin. Many performances and events were held at the bookstore, for example the first US performance of Austrian art pranksters monochrom in 1998. FringeWare was one of many independent businesses to disappear from Austin during the late 1990s.\n\nLebkowsky and Nathan, who met as Austin-based associate editors of the print version of \"bOING bOING\", originally conceived the company as a way to bring micro producers of cool software and gadgets to market via ecommerce. They began with an email list, which had high adoption among an international set of technoculture mavens and Internet early adopters, and later became known as the FringeWare News Network. Nathan built a web site in 1992, creating an early custom content management system and online catalog of products. This would have become the first instance of ecommerce on the Internet, however credit card companies pre-SSL prohibited online sales, so the alternative was mail-order, and this required a print catalog. While hashing out plans for a FringeWare catalog, the two decided to create a magazine, inspired by Boing Boing and Whole Earth Review/Coevolution Quarterly, with a catalog in the back pages. Mark Frauenfelder of Boing Boing referred to the publication as a \"magalog.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He was the founder of the Seville school.\n\nFrancisco Herrera was born in Seville in 1576. Francisco Pacheco was his teacher, but Herrera soon broke away from the timid style and Italian traditions of Spanish painting of his day, and became the pioneer of that bold, vigorous, effective, and natural style whose preeminent exponent was Velázquez. Herrera was the first to use long brushes, which may, in part, account for his \"modern\" technique and dexterous brushwork. Many authorities ascribe to him the foundation of the Spanish School. His great talent brought him many pupils, whom his passionate temper and rough manners soon drove away. Velázquez, when thirteen years old, was placed under this great professor, and remained a year with him. Herrera, who was an accomplished worker in bronze, engraved medals skilfully. This gave rise to the charge of counterfeiting, and he fled for sanctuary to the Jesuit College, for which he painted \"The Triumph of St. Hermengild\", a picture so impressive that when Philip IV saw it (1621) he immediately pardoned the painter. Herrera thereupon returned to Seville. His ungoverned temper soon drove his son to Rome and his daughter to a nunnery. Herrera's pictures are full of energy, the drawing is good and the colouring so cleverly managed that the figures stand out in splendid relief. Many of his small easel pictures, in oil, represent fairs, dances, interiors of inns, and deal with the intimate life of Spain. His large works are nearly all religious. In Seville he painted a \"St. Peter\" for the cathedral and a \"Last Judgment\" for the Church of San Bernardo, the latter being considered his masterpiece. After executing many commissions in his native town he removed to Madrid (1650), where he won great renown. In the archiepiscopal palace are four large canvases, one of which, \"Moses Smiting the Rock\", is celebrated for its dramatic qualities and daring technique. In the cloister of the Merced Calzada is a noteworthy series of paintings whose subjects are drawn from the life of St. Ramon. He painted much in fresco, in which medium his best effort is believed to have been on the vault of San Bonaventura, but this, with all his other frescoes, has disappeared. None of his architectural productions are mentioned, and there remain but a few of his etchings, all of which were reproductions of his paintings. One of his pictures, \"St. Basil dictating his doctrine\", is in the Louvre, and another, \"St. Matthew\", is in the Dresden Gallery. Herrera left two sons, \"el Rubio\" (the ruddy) who died before he fulfilled the great promise of his youth, and \"el Mozo\" (the younger).\n\nHerrera's finest paintings include \"The Last Judgment\" and a \"Holy Family,\" both in churches at Seville. Others are in the Louvre, Paris. They exhibit boldness of execution with faultless technique. He is known as \"El viejo\", \"the elder,\" to distinguish him from his son Francisco Herrera the Younger, also a noted painter. Among his pupils was Ignacio de Iriarte and a young Diego Velázquez.

It is of similar style to the Apocalypse of St. John the Divine, although sensational instead of seeking to frighten. It is framed as a dialogue from Jesus to the apostles (it varies significantly as to at which stage in time between the manuscripts), instigated by a series of extremely daring and outrageous questions and requests by Bartholomew.\n\nThe text appears to have been quite popular, judging by how well it survived, perhaps due to depictions of the supernatural. For example, the text implies that The Fall of Man was caused by Satan poisoning the water of Eden.\n\nThe text draws heavily on Jewish mysticism (such as the Book of Enoch), seeking to provide an explanation of the more supernatural aspects of Christian thought at the time. However, rather than a more clinical treatment that would be expected for such a treatise, it approaches these topics in a tabloid manner, evidently seeking to be a popular work rather than one for official church teaching.\n\nInitially, the text describes how Jesus descended into hell in his own words, and then jumps to discussing the virginal conception when Mary arrives amongst the apostles. Next, the apostles ask for a vision of hell, and angels roll up the earth to let them, and then return the earth when they have glimpsed it. \n\nFinally, Bartholomew asks to see Satan, and so a choir of angels drags Beliar (a name for Satan) from the depths of hell in chains, the sight of which kills the apostles dead. Jesus immediately brings them back to life and gives Bartholomew control over Satan. Bartholomew asks Satan how he came to be the enemy and other questions on esoteric subjects such as the hierarchy of the angels. He also explains the story of his removal from heaven. Satan's testimony also includes an admission to his role as the leader of six hundred fallen angels that fell with him.\n\nThe work is unique for the detail of introducing a direct son to Satan, named Salpsan. He is notably absent from the Latin version, appearing only in the Greek text.\n\nAnd I [Satan] looked about and saw the six hundred who were under me senseless. And I awakened my son Salpsan and took him to counsel how I might deceive the man on whose account I was cast out of the heavens.\n\nSatan and his son here have been interpreted as a counterpart to the Father and Son in Christianity. Although Salpsan was previously considered a possible reference to the Antichrist, authors have linked him instead to the Enochian tradition of the Watchers and their monstrous offspring. He is also compared to Cain in accounts where the latter is sired by the fallen angel Samael after seducing Eve.\n\n\n"}

It is based on a novella by Vera Caspary. An independent production distributed by Warner Bros., \"The Blue Gardenia\" - a cynical take on press coverage of a sensational murder case - was the first installment of Lang's \"newspaper noir\" movie trio, being followed in 1956 by both \"While the City Sleeps\" and \"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\". The song \"Blue Gardenia\" was written by Bob Russell and Lester Lee and arranged by Nelson Riddle. The director of cinematography for \"The Blue Gardenia\" was RKO regular Nicholas Musuraca, then working at Warner Brothers.\n\nIn Los Angeles, California, Norah Larkin (Anne Baxter) is a single woman who works as a switchboard operator along with her roommates, Crystal Carpenter (Ann Sothern) and Sally Ellis (Jeff Donnell). On her birthday, she decides to celebrate by dining alone at home, with the picture of her fiancé, a soldier serving in the Korean War. At the candlelight dinner table, she opens the latest letter from him and learns to her shock that he instead plans to marry a nurse he met in Tokyo.\n\nDevastated, Norah accepts a date over the telephone with womanizing calendar girl artist Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr). When she arrives at the Blue Gardenia restaurant and nightclub, Harry is surprised to see Norah, since he was expecting Crystal. However, he has dinner with her, and encourages her to drink six strong Polynesian Pearl Diver cocktails. Harry then takes her to his apartment, where he shows her his pictures and plays the record \"Blue Gardenia\", sung by Nat King Cole, whom they had just seen perform the same song at the restaurant. Norah passes out on Harry's couch, and he makes a sexual advance. She awakens and resists, and apparently strikes him with a fire poker, shattering a mirror. Norah flees the scene, leaving behind her black suede pumps, and returns home.\n\nThe next morning, Norah is awakened by Crystal; she has suffered a blackout as to the events of the previous night. Meanwhile, at the crime scene, police question a maid (Almira Sessions) about what she found before she discovered Harry's body. She admits to cleaning the poker, which would have removed any fingerprints, and placing the shoes in the closet, so valuable evidence has been compromised.\n\nAt Norah's workplace, the police arrive to question women who had posed for Harry. When Norah asks her colleague about the questioning, she is startled and goes to read the \"Los Angeles Chronicle\" newspaper's account of the slaying. Norah has a vague flashback of the wielding of a fire poker and the shattering of a mirror.\n\nNewspaper columnist Casey Mayo (Richard Conte) dubs the presumed killer the \"Blue Gardenia murderess.\" He learns from the Blue Gardenia waiter that the woman was a blonde, and from a blind female flower seller (Celia Lovsky) that the woman possessed a \"quiet voice\". That same night, at her apartment, Sally reads the newspaper report that the suspect wore a black dress at the time of the murder. Frightened, Norah wraps her own black dress in a newspaper and burns it in an outdoor incinerator. A patrolman arrives and demands to know why she is burning materials at an illegal hour, but he lets her off with a warning after she apologizes.\n\nWanting to catch the killer before the police do, Casey writes a column, titled \"Letter to an Unknown Murderess\", calling for her to turn herself in. Casey receives many bogus phone calls from local women, but when Norah calls, he realizes she is genuine. After one botched attempt, he meets her in his office. She convinces him that she is actually speaking for a friend, not herself, and Casey tells Norah that he is willing to pay for top legal representation if her friend agrees to surrender. The two later go to a diner, where Norah tells her supposed friend's account of the murder, but still insists her friend does not remember the actual killing. Casey asks to meet her friend at the diner the next day. Norah agrees and returns home, where she confesses to roommate Crystal, who is sympathetic.\n\nThe next day at the diner, Crystal meets Casey and points him to Norah's booth, where Norah finally admits that she herself is the woman he has been looking for. He feels shocked, because he had begun to fall in love with her. He also feels guilty, admitting to Norah that he was only pretending sympathy for the alleged killer when he thought it was someone other than her. Shortly afterward, the police arrive and arrest Norah. Bitter and confused, she mistakenly believes that Casey is the one who turned her in. (It was actually a diner employee.)\n\nAt an airport, Casey, with his colleague Al (Richard Erdman), notices that the piped-in music—the love theme from \"Tristan und Isolde\"—is identical to the music the maid found playing on Harry's phonograph. Finally grasping the significance of the fact that the records on the machine had been changed, Casey realizes it's possible that Norah was not the killer. Following up this hunch, Casey and Police Captain Sam Haynes (George Reeves) go to a local music shop. Harry's ex-girlfriend Rose Miller (Ruth Storey) is working in the back room at the shop. The clerk tells the police that it was Rose who sold Harry the record, and calls to her to come out and help. Realizing the police are closing in, she attempts suicide.\n\nFrom a hospital bed, Rose confesses that while Norah was passed out at Harry's apartment, she herself arrived, demanding that he marry her. (Although she does not say that she is pregnant, the audience of that time would assume that that was the reason for her desperate demands.) He refused, she says, and started playing the record that had brought them together. (That record being Toscanini conducting Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\".) Then, Rose recalls, she noticed Norah's handkerchief on the floor by the record player, and out of jealousy killed Harry with the poker. Norah, everyone finally understands, was simply an intoxicated and confused bystander.\n\nAfter Rose's confession, Norah is freed. She confides to friends that she has forgiven Casey and wants him as the new man in her life. Casey wants her as well, and tosses his \"little black book\" to his buddy Al.\n\n\nThe source novella for \"The Blue Gardenia\" was written by Vera Caspary and entitled \"The Gardenia\": the eventual amendment of the film's title to \"The Blue Gardenia\" would be an attempt to attract filmgoers by reminding them of the highly-publicized unsolved Black Dahlia murder of 1947. \"The Gardenia\" first appeared in the February–March issue of \"Today's Woman\" magazine: however the film rights for the novella had been acquired almost a full year earlier, it being announced in April 1951 that its filmation - purportedly entitled \"Gardenia\" - would be a production of the Howard Welsch-helmed Fidelity Pictures, who originally negotiated with Dorothy McGuire to play the female lead, which was subsequently offered to Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine, and Margaret Sullavan (had Sullavan played the film's female lead, \"[The Blue] Gardenia\" would have been her final movie rather than \"No Sad Songs for Me\" in 1950; Sullavan, who died in 1960, would have three television roles in the 1950s, one of them later than 1953).\n\nIn September 1952 the rights for \"Gardenia\" were sold to independent producer Alex Gottlieb with the film henceforth referred to as \"The Blue Gardenia\": despite reports of the female lead role being assigned to Darnell and also to the little-known Vicky Lane, Anne Baxter was announced for the role in November - \"The Blue Gardenia\" being considered the second of Baxter's two-picture pact with Warner Bros. as that studio signed to distribute the film - with the film's two other top-billed stars announced the same month. Being cast as the film's second female lead would afford Ann Sothern her first cinematic role since being dropped by Metro Goldwyn Mayer in 1950 due to her health issues. Prior to filming \"The Blue Gardenia\", Sothern had signed with CBS to star in the sitcom \"Private Secretary\", filming the first episodes in the latter half of December 1952 immediately after her eight days of filming on \"The Blue Gardenia\": Sothern's focus would remain focused on television roles with occasional cinematic forays, her next cinematic credit subsequent to \"The Blue Gardenia\" being the 1964 film \"The Best Man\". The last of the film's stars to be announced was male lead Richard Conte, who had previously starred for Alex Gottlieb Productions in \"The Fighter\": Fritz Lang, hired by Gottlieb to direct \"The Blue Gardenia\", had hoped to cast Dana Andrews, established as the top actor of the \"film noir\" genre, but Andrews had recently begun a sabbatical from film work.\n\nIn 1965 Fritz Lang - responding to the assertion by Peter Bogdanovich that \"The Blue Gardenia\" was \"a particularly venomous picture of American life\" - recalled the film as \"[Lang's] first picture after the McCarthy business and I had to shoot it in twenty days. Maybe that's what made me so venomous\". Although Lang evidently recalled his career as being seriously hindered by the Hollywood blacklist, the interval between his being hired for \"The Blue Gardenia\" (announced October 1952) and the completion of Lang's precedent directorial assignment: \"Clash by Night\", was not objectively an overly protracted lapse lasting only about seven or eight months (Lang would be hired by a major studio - Columbia Pictures - in January 1953 some three months before \"The Blue Gardenia\" was released). The filming of \"The Blue Gardenia\" commenced 28 November 1952 and was completed Christmas Eve, Lang wrapping the movie a day earlier than its 21-day filming schedule.\n\nReportedly Ruth Storey, the actress married to the film's leading man Richard Conte, while visiting her husband on-set during filming, accepted the producer's spontaneous suggestion that she play Rose in the film. Though this role was small, it was pivotal. Another key role – although uncredited – was played by Celia Lovsky, a long-time associate of Fritz Lang who had been instrumental in Lang's casting Peter Lorre – for a time Lovsky's husband – in \"M\", Lang's 1931 sound film break-through. Bit parts at the newspaper office were filled by the film's producer Alex Gottlieb and his wife, retired stage actress Polly Rose (sister of composer Billy Rose).\n\nWhen the film was first released, the staff at \"Variety\" magazine gave \"The Blue Gardenia\" a lukewarm review: \"A stock story and handling keep \"The Blue Gardenia\" from being anything more than a regulation mystery melodrama, from a yarn by Vera Caspary. Formula development has an occasional bright spot, mostly because Ann Sothern breathes some life into a stock character and quips ... Baxter and Conte do what they can but fight a losing battle with the script while Burr is a rather obvious wolf. Nat ‘King’ Cole is spotted to sing the title tune, written by Bob Russell and Lester Lee.\"\n\nFilm director and writer Peter Bogdanovich called \"The Blue Gardenia\" \"a particularly venomous picture of American life\". Jans B. Wager stated that it is a \"film that rigorously contains black masculinity within a peculiar studio set\". Critic Dennis Schwartz gave the movie a mixed review, writing: \"A minor film noir from Fritz Lang (\"Clash by Night\"/\"The Big Heat\") that never has a chance to bloom because of its dull script. It is based on the short story \"Gardenia\" by Vera Caspary. It plays as an unimaginative newspaper melodrama that takes jabs at the middle-class and how neurotic and fearful they are about romance. Nat \"King\" Cole makes a welcome cameo as the house pianist at the nightclub called The Blue Gardenia, crooning in his velvet voice the titular theme song. Noted cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca injects the film with some intriguing noir touches, such as those ominous rain drops on Raymond Burr's window the night of the murder ... Lang himself in interviews dismissed the film as a 'job-for-hire'. ... But the story itself wasn't original and the acting wasn't engaging enough to elevate it past being a mild thriller.\"\n\nA Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of \"The Blue Gardenia\" aired 30 November 1954, with the lead roles taken by Dana Andrews – in the role Fritz Lang had wanted him to play in the film – and Ruth Roman: Andrews would later play the male lead in both the 1956 movies: \"While the City Sleeps\" and \"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\", which were the second and third installments of the \"newspaper noir\" movie trio Lang began with the movie \"The Blue Gardenia\" (Lang was not involved in the Lux Radio production).\n\n"}
{"id": "1837609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837609", "title": "Bird flight", "text": "Bird flight\n\nBird flight is the primary mode of locomotion used by most bird species in which birds take off and fly. Flight assists birds with feeding, breeding, avoiding predators, and migrating.\n\nBird flight is one of the most complex forms of locomotion in the animal kingdom. Each facet of this type of motion, including hovering, taking off, and landing, involves many complex movements. As different bird species adapted over millions of years through evolution for specific environments, prey, predators, and other needs, they developed specializations in their wings, and acquired different forms of flight.\n\nVarious theories exist about how bird flight evolved, including flight from falling or gliding (the \"trees down\" hypothesis), from running or leaping (the \"ground up\" hypothesis), from \"wing-assisted incline running\" or from \" proavis\" (pouncing) behavior.\n\nThe fundamentals of bird flight are similar to those of aircraft, in which the aerodynamic forces sustaining flight are lift and drag. Lift force is produced by the action of air flow on the wing, which is an airfoil. The airfoil is shaped such that the air provides a net upward force on the wing, while the movement of air is directed downward. Additional net lift may come from airflow around the bird's body in some species, especially during intermittent flight while the wings are folded or semi-folded (cf. lifting body).\n\nAerodynamic drag is the force opposite to the direction of motion, and hence the source of energy loss in flight. The drag force can be separated into two portions, \"lift-induced drag\", which is the inherent cost of the wing producing lift (this energy ends up primarily in the wingtip vortices), and \"parasitic drag\", including skin friction drag from the friction of air and body surfaces and form drag from the bird's frontal area. The streamlining of bird's body and wings reduces these forces.\n\nThe bird's forelimbs (the wings) are the key to flight. Each wing has a central vane to hit the wind, composed of three limb bones, the humerus, ulna and radius. The hand, or manus, which ancestrally was composed of five digits, is reduced to three digits (digit II, III and IV or I, II, III depending on the scheme followed), which serves as an anchor for the primaries, one of two groups of flight feathers responsible for the wing's airfoil shape. The other set of flight feathers, behind the carpal joint on the ulna, are called the secondaries. The remaining feathers on the wing are known as coverts, of which there are three sets. The wing sometimes has vestigial claws. In most species, these are lost by the time the bird is adult (such as the highly visible ones used for active climbing by hoatzin chicks), but claws are retained into adulthood by the secretarybird, screamers, finfoots, ostriches, several swifts and numerous others, as a local trait, in a few specimens.\n\nAlbatrosses have locking mechanisms in the wing joints that reduce the strain on the muscles during soaring flight.\n\nEven within a species wing morphology may differ. For example, adult European Turtle Doves have been found to have longer but more rounded wings than juveniles – suggesting that juvenile wing morphology facilitates their first migrations, while selection for flight maneuverability is more important after the juveniles’ first molt. \n\nFemale birds exposed to predators during ovulation produce chicks that grow their wings faster than chicks produced by predator-free females. Their wings are also longer. Both adaptations may make them better at avoiding avian predators.\n\nThe shape of the wing is important in determining the flight capabilities of a bird. Different shapes correspond to different trade-offs between advantages such as speed, low energy use, and maneuverability. Two important parameters are the aspect ratio and wing loading. Aspect ratio is the ratio of wingspan to the mean of its chord (or the square of the wingspan divided by wing area). Wing loading is the ratio of weight to wing area.\n\nMost kinds of bird wing can be grouped into four types, with some falling between two of these types. These types of wings are elliptical wings, high speed wings, high aspect ratio wings and soaring wings with slots.\n\nTechnically, elliptical wings are those having elliptical (that is quarter ellipses) meeting conformally at the tips. The early model Supermarine Spitfire is an example. Some birds have vaguely elliptical wings, including the albatross wing of high aspect ratio. Although the term is convenient, it might be more precise to refer to curving taper with fairly small radius at the tips. Many small birds have having a low aspect ratio with elliptical character (when spread), allowing for tight maneuvering in confined spaces such as might be found in dense vegetation. As such they are common in forest raptors (such as \"Accipiter\" hawks), and many passerines, particularly non-migratory ones (migratory species have longer wings). They are also common in species that use a rapid take off to evade predators, such as pheasants and partridges.\n\nHigh speed wings are short, pointed wings that when combined with a heavy wing loading and rapid wingbeats provide an energetically expensive, but high speed. This type of flight is used by the bird with the fastest wing speed, the peregrine falcon, as well as by most of the ducks. The same wing shape is used by the auks for a different purpose; auks use their wings to \"fly\" underwater.\n\nThe peregrine falcon has the highest recorded dive speed of 242 mph (389 km/h). The fastest straight, powered flight is the spine-tailed swift at 105 mph (170 km/h).\n\nHigh aspect ratio wings, which usually have low wing loading and are far longer than they are wide, are used for slower flight. This may take the form of almost hovering (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and gliding flight, particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind speed variation at different altitudes (wind shear) above ocean waves to provide lift. Low speed flight is also important for birds that plunge-dive for fish.\n\nThese wings are favored by larger species of inland birds, such as eagles, vultures, pelicans, and storks. The slots at the end of the wings, between the primaries, reduce the induced drag and wingtip vortices by \"capturing\" the energy in air flowing from the lower to upper wing surface at the tips, whilst the shorter size of the wings aids in takeoff (high aspect ratio wings require a long taxi to get airborne).\n\nBirds use three types of flight. They are distinguished by wing motion.\n\nWhen in gliding flight, the upward aerodynamic force is equal to the weight. In gliding flight, no propulsion is used; the energy to counteract the energy loss due to aerodynamic drag is either taken from the potential energy of the bird, resulting in a descending flight, or is replaced by rising air currents (\"thermals\"), referred to as soaring flight. For specialist soaring birds (obligate soarers), the decision to engage in flight are strongly related to atmospheric conditions that allow individuals to maximise flight-efficiency and minimise energetic costs.\n\nWhen a bird flaps, as opposed to gliding, its wings continue to develop lift as before, but the lift is rotated forward to provide thrust, which counteracts drag and increases its speed, which has the effect of also increasing lift to counteract its weight, allowing it to maintain height or to climb. Flapping involves two stages: the down-stroke, which provides the majority of the thrust, and the up-stroke, which can also (depending on the bird's wings) provide some thrust. At each up-stroke the wing is slightly folded inwards to reduce the energetic cost of flapping-wing flight. Birds change the angle of attack continuously within a flap, as well as with speed.\n\nSmall birds often fly long distances using a technique in which short bursts of flapping are alternated with intervals in which the wings are folded against the body. This is a flight pattern known as \"bounding\" or \"flap-bounding\" flight. When the bird's wings are folded, its trajectory is primarily ballistic, with a small amount of body lift. The flight pattern is believed to decrease the energy required by reducing the aerodynamic drag during the ballistic part of the trajectory, and to increase the efficiency of muscle use.\n\nSeveral bird species use hovering, with one family specialized for hovering – the hummingbirds. True hovering occurs by generating lift through flapping alone, rather than by passage through the air, requiring considerable energy expenditure. This usually confines the ability to smaller birds, but some larger birds, such as a kite or osprey can hover for a short period of time. Although not a true hover, some birds remain in a fixed position relative to the ground or water by flying into a headwind. Hummingbirds, kestrels, terns and hawks use this wind hovering.\n\nMost birds that hover have high aspect ratio wings that are suited to low speed flying. Hummingbirds are a unique exception – the most accomplished hoverers of all birds. Hummingbird flight is different from other bird flight in that the wing is extended throughout the whole stroke, which is a symmetrical figure of eight, with the wing producing lift on both the up- and down-stroke. Hummingbirds beat their wings at some 43 times per second, while others may be as high as 80 times per second.\n\nTake-off is one of the most energetically demanding aspects of flight, as the bird must generate enough airflow across the wing to create lift. Small birds do this with a simple upward jump. That doesn't work for larger birds, which must take a run up to generate sufficient airflow. Large birds take off by facing into the wind, or, if they can, by perching on a branch or cliff so they can just drop off into the air.\n\nLanding is also a problem for large birds with high wing loads. This problem is dealt with in some species by aiming for a point below the intended landing area (such as a nest on a cliff) then pulling up beforehand. If timed correctly, the airspeed once the target is reached is virtually nil. Landing on water is simpler, and the larger waterfowl species prefer to do so whenever possible, landing into wind and using their feet as skids. To lose height rapidly prior to landing, some large birds such as geese indulge in a rapid alternating series of sideslips or even briefly turning upside down in a maneuver termed as \"whiffling\".\n\nA wide variety of birds fly together in a symmetric V-shaped or a J-shaped coordinated formation, also referred to as an \"echelon\", especially during long distance flight or migration. It is often assumed that birds resort to this pattern of formation flying in order to save energy and improve the aerodynamic efficiency. The birds flying at the tips and at the front would interchange positions in a timely cyclical fashion to spread flight fatigue equally among the flock members.\n\nThe wingtips of the leading bird in an echelon create a pair of opposite rotating line vortices. The vortices trailing a bird have an underwash part behind the bird, and at the same time they have an upwash on the outside, that hypothetically could aid the flight of a trailing bird. In a 1970 study the authors claimed that each bird in a V formation of 25 members can achieve a reduction of induced drag and as a result increase their range by 71%.\n\nStudies of waldrapp ibis show that birds spatially coordinate the phase of wing flapping and show wingtip path coherence when flying in V positions, thus enabling them to maximally utilise the available energy of upwash over the entire flap cycle. In contrast, birds flying in a stream immediately behind another do not have wingtip coherence in their flight pattern and their flapping is out of phase, as compared to birds flying in V patterns, so as to avoid the detrimental effects of the downwash due to the leading bird's flight.\n\nThe most obvious adaptation to flight is the wing, but because flight is so energetically demanding birds have evolved several other adaptations to improve efficiency when flying. Birds' bodies are streamlined to help overcome air-resistance. Also, the bird skeleton is hollow to reduce weight, and many unnecessary bones have been lost (such as the bony tail of the early bird \"Archaeopteryx\"), along with the toothed jaw of early birds, which has been replaced with a lightweight beak. The skeleton's breastbone has also adapted into a large keel, suitable for the attachment of large, powerful flight muscles. The vanes of each feather have hooklets called barbules that zip the vanes of individual feathers together, giving the feathers the strength needed to hold the airfoil (these are often lost in flightless birds). The barbules maintain the shape and function of the feather. Each feather has a major (greater) side and a minor (lesser) side, meaning that the shaft or rachis does not run down the center of the feather. Rather it runs longitudinally of center with the lesser or minor side to the front and the greater or major side to the rear of the feather. This feather anatomy, during flight and flapping of the wings, causes a rotation of the feather in its follicle. The rotation occurs in the up motion of the wing. The greater side points down, letting air slip through the wing. This essentially breaks the integrity of the wing, allowing for a much easier movement in the up direction. The integrity of the wing is reestablished in the down movement, which allows for part of the lift inherent in bird wings. This function is most important in taking off or achieving lift at very low or slow speeds where the bird is reaching up and grabbing air and pulling itself up. At high speeds the air foil function of the wing provides most of the lift needed to stay in flight.\n\nThe large amounts of energy required for flight have led to the evolution of a unidirectional pulmonary system to provide the large quantities of oxygen required for their high respiratory rates. This high metabolic rate produces large quantities of radicals in the cells that can damage DNA and lead to tumours. Birds, however, do not suffer from an otherwise expected shortened lifespan as their cells have evolved a more efficient antioxidant system than those found in other animals. \n\nMost paleontologists agree that birds evolved from small theropod dinosaurs, but the origin of bird flight is one of the oldest and most hotly contested debates in paleontology. The four main hypotheses are:\n\n\nThere has also been debate about whether the earliest known bird, \"Archaeopteryx\", could fly. It appears that \"Archaeopteryx\" had the brain structures and inner-ear balance sensors that birds use to control their flight. \"Archaeopteryx\" also had a wing feather arrangement like that of modern birds and similarly asymmetrical flight feathers on its wings and tail. But \"Archaeopteryx\" lacked the shoulder mechanism by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes; this may mean that it and other early birds were incapable of flapping flight and could only glide. The presence of most fossils in marine sediments in habitats devoid of vegetation has led to the hypothesis that they may have used their wings as aids to run across the water surface in the manner of the basilisk lizards.\n\nIn March 2018, scientists reported that \"Archaeopteryx\" was likely capable of flight, but in a manner substantially different from that of modern birds.\n\nThis was the earliest hypothesis, encouraged by the examples of gliding vertebrates such as flying squirrels. It suggests that proto-birds like \"Archaeopteryx\" used their claws to clamber up trees and glided off from the tops.\n\nSome recent research undermines the \"trees down\" hypothesis by suggesting that the earliest birds and their immediate ancestors did not climb trees. Modern birds that forage in trees have much more curved toe-claws than those that forage on the ground. The toe-claws of Mesozoic birds and of closely related non-avian theropod dinosaurs are like those of modern ground-foraging birds.\n\nFeathers are very common in coelurosaurid dinosaurs (including the early tyrannosauroid \"Dilong\"). Modern birds are classified as coelurosaurs by nearly all palaeontologists, though not by a few ornithologists. The original functions of feathers may have included thermal insulation and competitive displays. The most common version of the \"from the ground up\" hypothesis argues that bird's ancestors were small ground-running predators (rather like roadrunners) that used their forelimbs for balance while pursuing prey and that the forelimbs and feathers later evolved in ways that provided gliding and then powered flight. Another \"ground upwards\" theory argues the evolution of flight was initially driven by competitive displays and fighting: displays required longer feathers and longer, stronger forelimbs; many modern birds use their wings as weapons, and downward blows have a similar action to that of flapping flight. Many of the \"Archaeopteryx\" fossils come from marine sediments and it has been suggested that wings may have helped the birds run over water in the manner of the \"Jesus Christ lizard\" (common basilisk).\n\nMost recent attacks on the \"from the ground up\" hypothesis attempt to refute its assumption that birds are modified coelurosaurid dinosaurs. The strongest attacks are based on embryological analyses, which conclude that birds' wings are formed from digits 2, 3 and 4 (corresponding to the index, middle and ring fingers in humans; the first of a bird's 3 digits forms the alula, which they use to avoid stalling on low-speed flight, for example when landing); but the hands of coelurosaurs are formed by digits 1, 2 and 3 (thumb and first 2 fingers in humans). However these embryological analyses were immediately challenged on the embryological grounds that the \"hand\" often develops differently in clades that have lost some digits in the course of their evolution, and therefore bird's hands do develop from digits 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) hypothesis was prompted by observation of young chukar chicks, and proposes that wings developed their aerodynamic functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, for example to escape from predators. Note that in this scenario birds need \"downforce\" to give their feet increased grip. But early birds, including \"Archaeopteryx\", lacked the shoulder mechanism that modern birds' wings use to produce swift, powerful upstrokes. Since the downforce that WAIR requires is generated by upstrokes, it seems that early birds were incapable of WAIR.\n\nThe proavis theory was first proposed by Garner, Taylor, and Thomas in 1999:\nWe propose that birds evolved from predators that specialized in ambush from elevated sites, using their raptorial hindlimbs in a leaping attack. Drag–based, and later lift-based, mechanisms evolved under selection for improved control of body position and locomotion during the aerial part of the attack. Selection for enhanced lift-based control led to improved lift coefficients, incidentally turning a pounce into a swoop as lift production increased. Selection for greater swooping range would finally lead to the origin of true flight.\nThe authors believed that this theory had four main virtues:\n\n\nBirds use flight to obtain prey on the wing, for foraging, to commute to feeding grounds, and to migrate between the seasons. It is also used by some species to display during the breeding season and to reach safe isolated places for nesting.\n\nFlight is more energetically expensive in larger birds, and many of the largest species fly by soaring and gliding (without flapping their wings) as much as possible. Many physiological adaptations have evolved that make flight more efficient.\n\nBirds that settle on isolated oceanic islands that lack ground-based predators often lose the ability to fly. This illustrates both flight's importance in avoiding predators and its extreme demand for energy.\n\n\n\n"}

Following brief duty at the New York Naval Station, he served in \"Constitution\" on the North Atlantic Station. On 8 June 1812, he received orders to Norwich, Connecticut, where he took command of the gunboats located there.\n\nOn 14 March 1813, two days after receiving his commission as a lieutenant, Turner was sent to Sackett's Harbor, New York, located on the shores of Lake Erie. There, he took command of \"Niagara\", a brig in Oliver Hazard Perry's squadron. However, just before the Battle of Lake Erie, he relinquished command to Captain Jesse D. Elliott and assumed command of \"Caledonia\". The little brig played an important role in the battle on 10 September 1813 because, at one point in the action, her two 24-pounder long guns were the only ones in Perry's flotilla capable of returning the distant fire of the three heaviest Royal Navy ships then in the process of pounding Perry's flagship \"Lawrence\". For his part in the American victory at Lake Erie, Lt. Turner received the praise of Perry, a vote of thanks and a medal from Congress, and a sword from the state of New York. \n\nIn the summer of 1814, Turner succeeded to the command of schooner \"Scorpion\", and he cruised Lakes Erie and Huron in her supporting army operations around Detroit and blockading British forces at the Nottawasaga River and Lake Simcoe. On 6 September 1814, Turner and his command were captured by the British when he brought \"Scorpion\" alongside the former American schooner \"Tigress\" which, unbeknownst to him, had been captured a few days earlier. After a period of imprisonment at Fort Mackinac, Lt. Turner returned to the United States in exchange for a British prisoner of war.\n\nBetween 1815 and 1817, Turner cruised the Mediterranean in the frigate \"Java\" commanded by his old superior on the Great Lakes, Oliver Hazard Perry. During that deployment, \"Java\" visited Algiers and Tripoli in a show of American naval strength calculated to impress the Barbary pirates and intimidate them into honoring their treaties with the United States. In 1817, \"Java\" returned to Newport, Rhode Island, to be laid up.\n\nBetween 1819 and 1824, Turner returned to sea in the schooner \"Nonsuch\" attached to a squadron commanded again by Oliver Hazard Perry. In addition to hunting West Indian pirates, his ship sailed up the Orinoco River to carry Perry on a diplomatic mission to the Venezuelan government under Simon Bolivar. During the return downriver, Perry and many of the crew contracted yellow fever. Turner was close at hand when his mentor died at Trinidad on 23 August 1819. During the remaining years of Turner's assignment to \"Nonsuch\", his ship worked along the east coast of the United States, patrolled in the West Indies to suppress piracy, and made a brief cruise to the Mediterranean in 1824. \n\nFollowing shore duty at Boston, Massachusetts, Turner returned to sea in 1827 for a three-year assignment with the West India Squadron, as the commanding officer of \"Erie\". In 1830, he came ashore again for three years at the Portsmouth Navy Yard.\n\nPromoted to captain on 3 March 1835, Turner spent a long period waiting orders before returning to sea in 1839 in command of USS \"Constitution\". He sailed the Pacific Squadron in \"Old Ironsides,\" until he was relieved in 1841. From 1843 to 1846, he commanded the American squadron which operated along the Brazilian coast. From that duty, he reported ashore again as Commandant, Portsmouth Navy Yard. \n\nCapt. Turner died suddenly on 4 February 1850 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and he was buried in Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThree United States Navy destroyers have been named in honor of Captain Turner, including which was probably sunk by a German U-boat off of New York City in 1944.\n\nThere is a portrait of Captain Turner in the collection of the Redwood Library in Newport, Rhode Island.\n"}

{"id": "1837721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837721", "title": "Short-beaked echidna", "text": "Short-beaked echidna\n\nThe short-beaked echidna (\"Tachyglossus aculeatus\") is one of four living species of echidna and the only member of the genus Tachyglossus. It is covered in fur and spines and has a distinctive snout and a specialized tongue, which it uses to catch its insect prey at a great speed. Like the other extant monotremes, the short-beaked echidna lays eggs; the monotremes are the only group of mammals to do so.\n\nThe short-beaked echidna has extremely strong front limbs and claws, which allow it to burrow quickly with great power. As it needs to be able to survive underground, it has a significant tolerance to high levels of carbon dioxide and low levels of oxygen. It has no weapons or fighting ability but repels predators by curling into a ball and deterring them with its spines. It lacks the ability to sweat and cannot deal with heat well, so it tends to avoid daytime activity in hot weather. It can swim if needed. The snout has mechanoreceptors and electroreceptors that help the echidna to detect its surroundings.\n\nDuring the Australian winter, it goes into deep torpor and hibernation, reducing its metabolism to save energy. As the temperature increases, it emerges to mate. Female echidnas lay one egg a year and the mating period is the only time the otherwise solitary animals meet one another; the male has no further contact with the female or his offspring after mating. A newborn echidna is the size of a grape but grows rapidly on its mother's milk, which is very rich in nutrients. Baby echidnas eventually grow too large and spiky to stay in the pouch and, around seven weeks after hatching, are expelled from the pouch into the mother's burrow. At around six months of age, they leave the burrow and have no more contact with their mothers.\n\nThe species is found throughout Australia, where it is the most widespread native mammal, and in coastal and highland regions of eastern New Guinea, where it is known as the \"mungwe\" in the Daribi and Chimbu languages. It is not threatened with extinction, but human activities, such as hunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of foreign predatory species and parasites, have reduced its distribution in Australia.\n\nThe short-beaked echidna was first described by George Shaw in 1792. He named the species \"Myrmecophaga aculeata\", thinking that it might be related to the giant anteater. Since Shaw first described the species, its name has undergone four revisions: from \"M. aculeata\" to \"Ornithorhynchus hystrix\", \"Echidna hystrix\", \"Echidna aculeata\" and finally, \"Tachyglossus aculeatus\". The name \"Tachyglossus\" means \"quick tongue\", in reference to the speed with which the echidna uses its tongue to catch ants and termites, and \"aculeatus\" means \"spiny\" or \"equipped with spines\".\n\nThe short-beaked echidna is the only member of its genus, sharing the family Tachyglossidae with the extant species of the genus \"Zaglossus\" that occur in New Guinea. \"Zaglossus\" species, which include the western long-beaked, Sir David's long-beaked and eastern long-beaked echidnas, are all significantly larger than \"T. aculeatus\", and their diets consist mostly of worms and grubs rather than ants and termites. Species of the Tachyglossidae are egg-laying mammals; together with the related family Ornithorhynchidae, they are the only extant monotremes in the world.\n\nThe five subspecies of the short-beaked echidna are each found in different geographical locations. The subspecies also differ from one another in their hairiness, spine length and width, and the size of the grooming claws on their hind feet.\n\n\nThe earliest fossils of the short-beaked echidna date back around 15 million years ago to the Pleistocene era, and the oldest specimens were found in caves in South Australia, often with fossils of the long-beaked echidna from the same period. The ancient short-beaked echidnas are considered to be identical to their contemporary descendants except the ancestors are around 10% smaller. This \"post-Pleistocene dwarfing\" affects many Australian mammals. Part of the last radiation of monotreme mammals, echidnas are believed to have evolutionally diverged from the platypus around 66 million years ago, between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. However, the echidna's pre-Pleistocene heritage has not been traced yet, and the lack of teeth on the fossils found thus far have made it impossible to use dental evidence.\nThe short-beaked echidna was commonly called the spiny anteater in older books, though this term has fallen out of fashion since the echidna bears no relation to the true anteaters. It has a variety of names in the indigenous languages of the regions where it is found. The Noongar people from southwestern Western Australia call it the \"nyingarn\". In Central Australia southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara term is \"tjilkamata\" or \"tjirili\", from the word \"tjiri\" for spike of porcupine grass \"(Triodia irritans)\". The word can also mean slowpoke. In central Cape York Peninsula, it is called \"(minha) kekoywa\" in Pakanh, where \"minha\" is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', \"(inh-)ekorak\" in Uw Oykangand and \"(inh-)egorag\" in Uw Olkola, where \"inh-\" is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal'.\nIn the highland regions of southwestern New Guinea, it is known as the \"mungwe\" in the Daribi and Chimbu languages.\n\nThe shorted-beaked echidna is called miɣu in the Motu language of Papua New Guinea.\n\nShort-beaked echidnas are typically in length, with of snout, and weigh between . However, the Tasmanian subspecies, \"T. a. setosus\", is smaller than its Australian mainland counterparts. Because the neck is not externally visible, the head and body appear to merge. The earholes are on either side of the head, with no external pinnae. The eyes are small, about in diameter and at the base of the wedge-shaped snout. The nostrils and the mouth are at the distal end of the snout; the mouth cannot open wider than . The body of the short-beaked echidna is, with the exception of the underside, face and legs, covered with cream-coloured spines. The spines, which may be up to long, are modified hairs, mostly made of keratin. Insulation is provided by fur between the spines, which ranges in colour from honey to a dark reddish-brown and even black; the underside and short tail are also covered in fur. Colouration of the fur and spines varies with geographic location. For example, the spines of the Kangaroo Island subspecies (\"T. a. multiaculeatus\") are more numerous, longer, thinner, and paler in colour than those of the other subspecies.\n\nThe echidna's fur may be infested with what is said to be the world's largest flea, \"Bradiopsylla echidnae\", which is about long.\n\nThe limbs of the short-beaked echidna are adapted for rapid digging; they are short and have strong claws. Their strong and stout limbs allow it to tear apart large logs and move paving stones, and one has been recorded moving a 13.5-kg (30-lb) stone; a scientist also reported that a captive echidna moved a refrigerator around the room in his home. The power of the limbs is based on strong musculature, particularly around the shoulder and torso areas. The mechanical advantage of its arm is greater than that of humans, as its biceps connects the shoulder to the forearm at a point further down than for humans, and the chunky humerus allows more muscle to form.\nThe claws on the hind feet are elongated and curved backward to enable cleaning and grooming between the spines. Like the platypus, the echidna has a low body temperature—between 30 and 32 °C (86 and 90 °F)—but, unlike the platypus, which shows no evidence of torpor or hibernation, the body temperature of the echidna may fall as low as 5 °C (41 °F). The echidna does not pant or sweat and normally seeks shelter in hot conditions. Despite their inability to sweat, echidnas still lose water as they exhale. The snout is believed to be crucial in restricting this loss to sustainable levels, through a bony labyrinth that has a refrigerator effect and helps to condense water vapour in the breath. The echidna does not have highly concentrated urine, and around half of the estimated daily water loss of occurs in this manner, while most of the rest is through the skin and respiratory system. Most of this is replenished by its substantial eating of termites—one laboratory study reported ingestion of around a day, most of which was water. This can be supplemented by drinking water, if available, or licking morning dew from flora.\n\nIn the Australian autumn and winter, the echidna enters periods of torpor or deep hibernation. Because of its low body temperature, it becomes sluggish in very hot and very cold weather.\n\nLike all monotremes, it has one orifice, the cloaca, for the passage of faeces, urine and reproductive products. The male has internal testes, no external scrotum and a highly unusual penis with four knobs on the tip, which is nearly a quarter of his body length when erect. The gestating female develops a pouch on her underside, where she raises her young.\nThe musculature of the short-beaked echidna has a number of unusual aspects. The panniculus carnosus, an enormous muscle just beneath the skin, covers the entire body. By contraction of various parts of the panniculus carnosus, the short-beaked echidna can change shape, the most characteristic shape change being achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened, so protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines. It has one of the shortest spinal cords of any mammal, extending only as far as the thorax. Whereas the human spinal cord ends at the first or second lumbar vertebra, for the echidna it occurs at the seventh thoracic vertebra. The shorter spinal cord is thought to allow flexibility to enable wrapping into a ball.\n\nThe musculature of the face, jaw and tongue is specialised for feeding. The tongue is the animal's sole means of catching prey, and can protrude up to outside the snout. The snout's shape, resembling a double wedge, gives it a significant mechanical advantage in generating a large moment, so makes it efficient for digging to reach prey or to build a shelter. The tongue is sticky because of the presence of glycoprotein-rich mucus, which both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites, which adhere to it. The tongue is protruded by contracting circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forwards and contracting two genioglossal muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the mandible. The protruded tongue is stiffened by a rapid flow of blood, which allows it to penetrate wood and soil. Retraction requires the contraction of two internal longitudinal muscles, known as the sternoglossi. When the tongue is retracted, the prey is caught on backward-facing keratinous \"teeth\", located along the roof of the buccal cavity, allowing the animal both to capture and grind food. The tongue moves with great speed, and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute. This is partly achieved through the elasticity of the tongue and the conversion of elastic potential energy into kinetic energy. The tongue is very flexible, particularly at the end, allowing it to bend in U-turns and catch insects attempting to flee in their labyrinthine nests or mounds. The tongue also has an ability to avoid picking up splinters while foraging in logs; the factors behind this ability are unknown. It can eat quickly; a specimen of around can ingest of termites in 10 minutes.\n\nThe echidna's stomach is quite different from other mammals. It is devoid of secretory glands and has a cornified stratified epithelium, which resembles horny skin. Unlike other mammals, which typically have highly acidic stomachs, the echidna has low levels of acidity, almost neutral, with pH in the 6.2–7.4 range. The stomach is elastic, and gastric peristalsis grinds soil particulates and shredded insects together. Digestion occurs in the small intestine, which is around in length. The insect exoskeletons and soil are not digested, being ejected in the waste.\n\nNumerous physiological adaptations aid the lifestyle of the short-beaked echidna. Because the animal burrows, it must tolerate very high levels of carbon dioxide in inspired air, and will voluntarily remain in situations where carbon dioxide concentrations are high. It can dig up to a metre into the ground to retrieve ants or evade predators, and can survive with low oxygen when the area is engulfed by bushfires. The echidna can also dive underwater, which can help it to survive sudden floods. During these situations, the heart rate drops to around 12 beats per minute, around one-fifth of the rate at rest. This process is believed to save oxygen for the heart and brain, which are the most sensitive organs to such a shortage; laboratory testing has revealed the echidna's cardiovascular system is similar to that of the seal. Following the devastation of a bushfire, echidnas can compensate for the lack of food by reducing their daytime body temperature and activity through use of torpor, for a period of up to three weeks.\n\nThe echidna's optical system is an uncommon hybrid of both mammalian and reptilian characteristics. The cartilaginous layer beneath the sclera of the eyeball is similar to that of reptiles and avians. The small corneal surface is keratinised and hardened, possibly to protect it from chemicals secreted by prey insects or self-impalement when it rolls itself up, which has been observed. The echidna has the flattest lens of any animal, giving it the longest focal length. This similarity to primates and humans allows it to see distant objects clearly. Unlike placental mammals, including humans, the echidna does not have a ciliary muscle to distort the geometry of the lens and thereby change the focal length and allow objects at different distances to be viewed clearly; the whole eye is believed to distort, so the distance between the lens and retina instead changes to allow focusing. The visual ability of an echidna is not great, and it is not known whether it can perceive colour; however, it can distinguish between black and white, and horizontal and vertical stripes. Eyesight is not a crucial factor in the animal's ability to survive, as blind echidnas are able to live healthily.\nIts ears are sensitive to low-frequency sound, which may be ideal for detecting sounds emitted by termites and ants underground. The pinnae are obscured and covered by hair, so predators cannot grab them in an attack, and prey or foreign material cannot enter, although ticks are known to reside there. The macula of the ear is very large compared to other animals, and is used as a gravity sensor to orient the echidna. The large size may be important for burrowing downwards.\n\nThe leathery snout is keratinised and covered in mechano- and thermoreceptors, which provide information about the surrounding environment. These nerves protrude through microscopic holes at the end of the snout, which also has mucus glands on the end that act as electroreceptors. Echidnas can detect electric fields of 1.8 mV/cm—1000 times more sensitive than humans—and dig up buried batteries. A series of push rods protrude from the snout. These are columns of flattened, spinous cells, with roughly an average diameter of 50 micrometres and a length of 300 micrometres. The number of push rods per square millimetre of skin is estimated to be 30 to 40. Longitudinal waves are believed to be picked up and transmitted through the rods, acting as mechanical sensors, to allow prey detection.\n\nA well-developed olfactory system may be used to detect mates and prey. A highly sensitive optic nerve has been shown to have visual discrimination and spatial memory comparable to those of a rat. The brain and central nervous system have been extensively studied for evolutionary comparison with placental mammals, particularly with its fellow monotreme, the platypus. The average brain volume is 25 ml, similar to a cat of approximately the same size; while the platypus has a largely smooth brain, the echidna has a heavily folded and fissured, gyrencephalic brain similar to humans, which is seen as a sign of a highly neurologically advanced animal. The cerebral cortex is thinner, and the brain cells are larger and more densely packed and organised in the echidna than the platypus, suggesting evolutionary divergence must have occurred long ago. Almost half of the sensory area in the brain is devoted to the snout and tongue, and the part devoted to smell is relatively large compared to other animals.\n\nThe short-beaked echidna has the largest prefrontal cortex relative to body size of any mammal, taking up 50% of the volume in comparison to 29% for humans. This part of the brain in humans is thought to be used for planning and analytical behaviour, leading to debate as to whether the echidna has reasoning and strategising ability. Experiments in a simple maze and with a test on opening a trap door to access food, and the echidna's ability to remember what it has learnt for over a month, has led scientists to conclude its learning ability is similar to that of a cat or a rat.\n\nThe echidna shows rapid eye movement during sleep, usually around its thermoneutral temperature of 25 °C, and this effect is suppressed at other temperatures. Its brain has been shown to contain a claustrum similar to that of placental mammals, linking this structure to their common ancestor.\n\nNo systematic study of the ecology of the short-beaked echidna has been published, but studies of several aspects of their ecological behaviour have been conducted. They live alone, and, apart from the burrow created for rearing young, they have no fixed shelter or nest site. They do not have a home territory they defend against other echidnas, but range over a wide area. The range area has been observed to be between 21 and 93 ha, although one study in Kangaroo Island found the animals there covered an area between 9 and 192 ha. Overall, the mean range areas across the various regions of Australia were 40–60 ha. There was no correlation between gender and range area, but a weak one with size. Echidnas can share home ranges without incident, and sometimes share shelter sites if not enough are available for each animal to have one individually.\n\nShort-beaked echidnas are typically active in the daytime, though they are ill-equipped to deal with heat because they have no sweat glands and do not pant. Therefore, in warm weather, they change their patterns of activity, becoming crepuscular or nocturnal. Body temperatures above 34 °C (93 °F) are believed to be fatal, and in addition to avoiding heat, the animal adjusts its circulation to maintain a sustainable temperature by moving blood to and from the skin to increase or lower heat loss. In areas where water is present, they can also swim to keep their body temperatures low. The \"thermoneutral zone\" for the environment is around 25 °C (77 °F), at which point the metabolism needed to maintain body temperature is minimized. The echidna is endothermic, and can maintain body temperatures of around 32 °C. It can also reduce its metabolism and heart rate and body temperature. In addition to brief and light bouts of torpor throughout the year, the echidna enters periods during the Australian winter when it hibernates, both in cold regions and in regions with more temperate climates. During hibernation, the body temperature drops to as low as 4 °C (39 °F). The heart rate falls to four to seven beats per minute—down from 50–68 at rest—and the echidna can breathe as infrequently as once every three minutes, 80 to 90% slower than when it is active. Metabolism can drop to one-eighth of the normal rate. Echidnas begin to prepare for hibernation between February and April, when they reduce their consumption and enter brief periods of torpor. Males begin hibernating first, while females that have reproduced start later. During periods of hibernation, the animals average 13 separate bouts of torpor, which are broken up by periods of arousal lasting 1.2 days on average. These interruptions tend to coincide with warmer periods. Males end their hibernation period in mid-June, while reproductive females return to full activity in July and August; nonreproductive females and immature echidnas may not end hibernation until two months later. During euthermia, the body temperature can vary by 4 °C per day. The metabolic rate is around 30% of that of placental mammals, making it the lowest energy-consuming mammal. This figure is similar to that of other animals that eat ants and termites; burrowing animals also tend to have low metabolism generally.\n\nEchidnas hibernate even though it is seemingly unnecessary for survival; they begin their hibernation period while the weather is still warm, and food is generally always plentiful. One explanation is that echidnas maximize their foraging productivity by exercising caution with their energy reserves. Another hypothesis is that they are descended from ectothermic ancestors, but have taken to periodic endothermy for reproductive reasons, so that the young can develop more quickly. Supporters of this theory argue that males hibernate earlier than females because they finish their contribution to reproduction first, and they awake earlier to undergo spermatogenesis in preparation for mating, while females and young lag in their annual cycle. During the hibernation period, the animals stay in entirely covered shelter.\n\nShort-beaked echidnas can live anywhere with a good supply of food, and regularly feast on ants and termites. They are believed to locate food by smell, using sensors in the tips of their snouts, by shuffling around seemingly arbitrarily, and using their snout in a probing manner. A study of echidnas in New England (New South Wales) has shown that they tend to dig up scarab beetle larvae in spring when the prey are active, but eschew this prey when it is inactive, leading to the conjecture that echidnas detect prey using hearing. Vision is not believed to be significant in hunting, as blind animals have been observed to survive in the wild.\n\nEchidnas use their strong claws to pull apart nests and rotting logs to gain access to their prey. They avoid ants and termites that secrete repulsive liquids, and have a preference for the eggs, pupae and winged phases of the insects. Echidnas hunt most vigorously towards the end of the southern winter and early in spring, when their fat reserves have been depleted after hibernation and nursing. At this time, ants have high body fat, and the echidna targets their mounds. The animal also hunts beetles and earthworms, providing they are small enough to fit in a 5-mm gap. The proportion of ants and termites in their diets depends on the availability of prey, and termites make up a larger part in drier areas where they are more plentiful. However, termites are preferred, if available, as their bodies contain a smaller proportion of indigestible exoskeleton. Termites from the Rhinotermitidae family are avoided due to their chemical defences. Scarab beetle larvae are also a large part of the diet when and where available. In the New England study, 37% of the food intake consisted of beetle larvae, although the echidna had to squash the prey in its snout as it ingested it, due to size.\n\nEchidnas are powerful diggers, using their clawed front paws to dig out prey and create burrows for shelter. They may rapidly dig themselves into the ground if they cannot find cover when in danger. They bend their belly together to shield the soft, unprotected part, and can also urinate, giving off a pungent liquid, in an attempt to deter attackers. Males also have single small spurs on each rear leg, believed to be a defensive weapon that has since been lost through evolution. Echidnas typically try to avoid confrontation with predators. Instead, they use the colour of their spines, which is similar to the vegetation of the dry Australian environment, to avoid detection. They have good hearing and tend to become stationary if sound is detected.\n\nIt is likely that Echidnas are keystone species in the ecosystem health in Australia, due to their contribution through bioturbation, the reworking of soils through their digging activity. This is based on the estimation that a single echidna will move up to 204 m of soil a year, that it is the most widespread of any terrestrial Australian species, is relatively common, and that other bioturbators have been heavily impacted by human settlement.\n\nIn Australia, they are most common in forested areas with abundant, termite-filled, fallen logs. In agricultural areas, they are most likely to be found in uncleared scrub; they may be found in grassland, arid areas, and in the outer suburbs of the capital cities. Little is known about their distribution in New Guinea. They have been found in southern New Guinea between Merauke in the west and the Kelp Welsh River, east of Port Moresby, in the east, where they may be found in open woodland.\n\nEchidnas have the ability to swim, and have been seen cooling off near dams during high temperatures. They have also been seen crossing streams and swimming for brief periods in seas off Kangaroo Island. They swim with only the snout above water, using it as a snorkel.\n\nThe solitary short-beaked echidna looks for a mate between May and September; the precise timing of the mating season varies with geographic location. In the months before the mating season, the size of the male's testes increases by a factor of three or more before spermatogenesis occurs. Both males and females give off a strong, musky odour during the mating season, by turning their cloacas inside out and wiping them on the ground, secreting a glossly liquid believed to be an aphrodisiac. During courtship—observed for the first time in 1989—males locate and pursue females. Trains of up to 10 males, often with the youngest and smallest male at the end of the queue, may follow a single female in a courtship ritual that may last for up to four weeks; the duration of the courtship period varies with location. During this time, they forage for food together, and the train often changes composition, as some males leave and other join the pursuit. In cooler parts of their range, such as Tasmania, females may mate within a few hours of arousal from hibernation.\n\nBefore mating, the male smells the female, paying particular attention to the cloaca. This process can take a few hours, and the female can reject the suitor by rolling herself into a ball. After prodding and sniffing her back, the male is often observed to roll the female onto her side and then assume a similar position himself so the two animals are abdomen to abdomen, having dug a small crater in which to lie. They can lie with heads facing one another, or head to rear. If more than one male is in the vicinity, fighting over the female may occur. Each side of the bilaterally symmetrical, rosette-like, four-headed penis (similar to that of reptiles and in length) is used alternately, with the other half being shut down between ejaculations. Sperm bundles of around 100 each appear to confer increased sperm motility, which may provide the potential for sperm competition between males. This process takes between a half and three hours. Each mating results in the production of a single egg, and females are known to mate only once during the breeding season; each mating is successful.\n\nFertilisation occurs in the oviduct. Gestation takes between 21 and 28 days after copulation, during which time the female constructs a nursery burrow. Following the gestation period, a single, rubbery-skinned egg between in diameter and in weight is laid from her cloaca directly into a small, backward-facing pouch that has developed on her abdomen. The egg is ovoid, leathery, soft, and cream-coloured. Between laying and hatching, some females continue to forage for food, while others dig burrows and rest there until hatching. Ten days after it is laid, the egg hatches within the pouch. The embryo develops an \"egg tooth\" during incubation, which it uses to tear open the egg; the tooth disappears soon after hatching.\n\nHatchlings are about long and weigh between . After hatching, young echidnas are known as \"puggles\". Although newborns are still semitranslucent and still surrounded by the remains of the egg yolk, and the eyes are still barely developed, they already have well-defined front limbs and digits that allow them to climb on their mothers' bodies. Hatchlings attach themselves to their mothers' milk areolae, specialised patches on the skin that secrete milk—monotremes lack nipples—through about 100–150 pores. The puggles were thought to have imbibed the milk by licking the mother's skin, but they are now thought to feed by sucking the areolae.\n\nThey have been observed ingesting large amounts during each feeding period, and mothers may leave them unattended in the burrow for between five and ten days to find food. Studies of captives have shown they can ingest milk once every two or three days and then increase their mass by 20% in one milk-drinking session lasting between one and two hours. Around 40% of the milk weight is converted into body mass, and as such, a high proportion of milk is converted into growth; a correlation with the growth of the puggle and its mother's size has been observed. By the time the puggle is around , it is left in the burrow while the mother forages for food, and it reaches around after around two months. Juveniles are eventually ejected from the pouch at around two to three months of age, because of the continuing growth in the length of their spines. During this period, the young are left in covered burrows while the mothers forage, and the young are often preyed upon. Suckling gradually decreases until juveniles are weaned at about six months of age. The duration of lactation is about 200 days, and the young leave the burrow after 180 to 205 days, usually in January or February, at which time they weigh around . There is no contact between the mother and young after this point.\n\nThe composition of the milk secreted by the mother changes over time. At the moment of birth, the solution is dilute and contains 1.25% fat, 7.85% protein, and 2.85% carbohydrates and minerals. Mature milk has much more concentrated nutrients, with 31.0, 12.4 and 2.8% of the aforementioned nutrients, respectively. Near weaning, the protein level continues to increase; this may be due to the need for keratin synthesis for hair and spines, to provide defences against the cold weather and predators.\n\nThe principal carbohydrate components of the milk are fucosyllactose and saialyllactose; it has a high iron content, which gives it a pink colour. The high iron content and low levels of free lactose differ from eutherian mammals. Lactose production is believed to proceed along the same lines as in the platypus.\n\nThe age of sexual maturity is uncertain, but may be four to five years. A 12-year field study found the short-beaked echidna reaches sexual maturity between five and 12 years of age, and the frequency of reproduction varies from once every two years to once every six years. In the wild, the short-beaked echidna has an average lifespan of 10 years, though they can live as long as 40. The longest-lived specimen reached 49 years of age in a zoo in Philadelphia. In contrast to other mammals, echidna rates of reproduction and metabolism are lower, and they live longer, as though in slow motion, something caused, at least in part, by their low body temperature, which rarely exceeds 33 °C, even when they are not hibernating.\n\nLike its fellow monotreme the platypus, the short-beaked echidna has a system of multiple sex chromosomes, in which males have four Y chromosomes and five X chromosomes. Males appear to be XYXYXYXYX (figure), while females are XXXXXXXXXX. Weak identity between chromosomes results in meiotic pairing that yields only two possible genotypes of sperm, XXXXX or YYYY, thus preserving this complex system.\n\nThe short-beaked echidna is common throughout most of temperate Australia and lowland New Guinea, and is not listed as endangered. In Australia, it remains widespread across a wide range of conditions, including urban outskirts, coastal forests and dry inland areas, and is especially widespread in Tasmania and on Kangaroo Island.\n\nThe most common threats to the animal in Australia are motor vehicles and habitat destruction, which have led to localized extinctions. In Australia, the number of short-beaked echidnas has been less affected by land clearance than have some other species, since they do not require a specialized habitat beyond a good supply of ants and termites. As a result, they can survive in cleared land if the cut-down wood is left in the area, as the logs can be used as shelters and sources of insects. However, areas where the land has been completely cleared for single crops that can be mechanically harvested, such as wheat fields, have seen extinctions. Over a decade-long period, around one-third of echidna deaths reported to wildlife authorities in Victoria were due to motor vehicles, and the majority of wounded animals handed in were traffic accident victims. Studies have shown they often choose to traverse drainage culverts under roads, so this is seen as a viable means of reducing deaths on busy roads in rural areas or national parks where the animals are more common.\n\nDespite their spines, they are preyed on by birds of prey, the Tasmanian devil, dingoes, snakes, lizards, goannas, cats, and foxes, although almost all victims are young. Goannas are known for their digging abilities and strong sense of smell, and are believed to have been the main predators of the echidna before the introduction of eutherian mammals. Dingoes are known to kill echidnas by rolling them over onto their backs and attacking their underbellies. A tracking study of a small number of echidnas on Kangaroo Island concluded that goannas and cats were the main predators, although foxes—absent in Kangaroo Island—would be expected to be a major threat.\n\nThey were eaten by indigenous Australians and the early European settlers of Australia. Hunting and eating of the echidna in New Guinea has increased over time and caused a decline in the population and distribution areas; it is now believed to have disappeared from highland areas. The killing of echidnas was a taboo in traditional culture, but since the tribespeople have become increasingly Westernised, hunting has increased, and the animals have been more easily tracked down due to the use of dogs.\n\nInfection with the introduced parasitic tapeworm \"Spirometra erinaceieuropaei\" is considered fatal for the echidna. This waterborne infection is contracted through sharing drinking areas with infected dogs, foxes, cats, and dingos, which do not die from the parasite. The infection is seen as being more dangerous in drier areas, where more animals are sharing fewer bodies of water, increasing the chance of transmission. The Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland runs an Australia-wide survey, called Echidna Watch, to monitor the species. Echidnas are also known to be affected by other tapeworms, protozoans and herpes-like viral infections, but little is known of how the infections affect the health of the animals or the populations.\n\nAlthough it is considered easy to keep echidnas healthy in captivity, breeding is difficult, partly due to the relatively infrequent cycle. In 2009, Perth Zoo managed to breed some captive short-beaked echidnas, and in 2015 the first zoo-born echidnas were successfully bred there. Until 2006, only five zoos have managed to breed short-beaked echidnas, but no captive-bred young have survived to maturity. Of these five institutions, only one in Australia—Sydney's Taronga Zoo—managed to breed echidnas, in 1977. The other four cases occurred in the Northern Hemisphere, two in the United States and the others in western Europe. In these cases, breeding occurred six months out of phase compared to Australia, after the animals had adapted to Northern Hemisphere seasons. The failure of captive breeding programs has conservation implications for the endangered species of echidna from the genus \"Zaglossus\", and to a lesser extent for the short-beaked echidna.\n\nShort-beaked echidnas feature in the animistic culture of indigenous Australians, including their visual arts and stories. The species was a totem for some groups, including the Noongar people from Western Australia. Many groups have myths about the animal; one myth explains it was created when a group of hungry young men went hunting at night and stumbled across a wombat. They threw spears at the wombat, but lost sight of it in the darkness. The wombat adapted the spears for its own defence and turned into an echidna.\n\nThe short-beaked echidna is an iconic animal in contemporary Australia, notably appearing on the Australian five-cent coin (the smallest denomination), and on a A$200 commemorative coin released in 1992. The anthropomorphic echidna \"Millie\" was a mascot for the 2000 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1837735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837735", "title": "Wittig reaction", "text": "Wittig reaction\n\nThe Wittig reaction or Wittig olefination is a chemical reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a triphenyl phosphonium ylide (often called a Wittig reagent) to give an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nIt is widely used in organic synthesis for the preparation of alkenes. It should not be confused with the Wittig rearrangement.\n\nWittig reactions are most commonly used to couple aldehydes and ketones to singly-substituted triphenylphosphonium ylides. For the reaction with aldehydes, the double bond geometry is readily predicted based on the nature of the ylide. With unstabilised ylides (R = alkyl) this results in (\"Z\")-alkene product with moderate to high selectivity. With stabilized ylides (R = ester or ketone), the (\"E\")-alkene is formed with high selectivity. The (\"E\")/(\"Z\") selectivity is often poor with semistabilized ylides (R = aryl).\n\nTo obtain the (\"E\")-alkene for unstabilized ylides, the Schlosser modification of the Wittig reaction can be used. Alternatively, the Julia olefination and its variants also provide the (\"E\")-alkene selectively. Ordinarily, the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction provides the (\"E\")-enoate (α,β-unsaturated ester), just as the Wittig reaction does. To obtain the (\"Z\")-enoate, the Still-Gennari modification of the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction can be used.\n\nThe steric bulk of the ylide 1 influences the stereochemical outcome of nucleophilic addition to give a predominance of the betaine 3 (cf. Bürgi–Dunitz angle). Note that for betaine 3 both R and R as well as PPh and O are positioned anti to one another.\n\nCarbon-carbon bond rotation gives the betaine 4, which then forms the oxaphosphetane 5. Elimination gives the desired Z-alkene 7 and triphenylphosphine oxide 6. With simple Wittig reagents, the first step occurs easily with both aldehydes and ketones, and the decomposition of the betaine (to form 5) is the rate-determining step. However, with stabilised ylides (where R stabilises the negative charge) the first step is the slowest step, so the overall rate of alkene formation decreases and a bigger proportion of the alkene product is the E-isomer. This also explains why stabilised reagents fail to react well with sterically hindered ketones.\n\nMechanistic studies have focused on unstabilized ylides, because the intermediates can be followed by NMR spectroscopy. The existence and interconversion of the betaine (3a and 3b) is subject of ongoing research. For lithium-free Wittig reactions, most recent studies support a concerted formation of the oxaphosphetane without intervention of a betaine. In particular, phosphonium ylides 1 react with carbonyl compounds 2 via a [2+2] cycloaddition that is sometimes described as having [2+2] topology to directly form the oxaphosphetanes 4a and 4b. Under lithium-free conditions, the stereochemistry of the product 5 is due to the kinetically controlled addition of the ylide 1 to the carbonyl 2. When lithium is present, there may be equilibration of the intermediates, possibly via betaine species 3a and 3b. Bruce E. Maryanoff and A. B. Reitz identified the issue about equilibration of Wittig intermediates and termed the process \"stereochemical drift\". For many years, the stereochemistry of the Wittig reaction, in terms of carbon-carbon bond formation, had been assumed to correspond directly with the Z/E stereochemistry of the alkene products. However, certain reactants do not follow this simple pattern. Lithium salts can also exert a profound effect on the stereochemical outcome.\n\nMechanisms differ for aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and for aromatic and aliphatic phosphonium ylides. Evidence suggests that the Wittig reaction of unbranched aldehydes under lithium-salt-free conditions do not equilibrate and are therefore under kinetic reaction control. E. Vedejs has put forth a theory to explain the stereoselectivity of stabilized and unstabilized Wittig reactions.\n\nStrong evidence indicated that under Li-free conditions, Wittig reactions involving unstabilized (R= alkyl, H), semistabilized (R = aryl), and stabilized (R = EWG) Wittig reagents all proceed via a [2+2]/retro-[2+2] mechanism under kinetic control, with oxaphosphetane as the one and only intermediate.\n\nSimple phosphoranes typically hydrolyze and oxidize readily. They are therefore prepared using air-free techniques. Phosphoranes are more air-stable when they contain an electron withdrawing group attached to the carbon. Some examples are PhP=CHCOR and PhP=CHPh. These ylides are sufficiently stable to be sold commercially.\n\nWittig reagents are usually prepared from a phosphonium salt, which is in turn prepared by the quaternization of triphenylphosphine with an alkyl halide. The alkylphosphonium salt is deprotonated with a strong base such as \"n\"-butyllithium:\n\nBesides \"n\"-butyllithium (\"\"BuLi), other strong bases like sodium and potassium \"t\"-butoxide (\"\"BuONa, \"\"BuOK), lithium, sodium and potassium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS, NaHMDS, KHDMS, where HDMS = N(SiMe)), or sodium hydride (NaH) are also commonly used. For stabilized Wittig reagents bearing conjugated electron-withdrawing groups, even relatively weak bases like aqueous sodium hydroxide or potassium carbonate can be employed.\n\nThe identification of a suitable base is often an important step when optimizing a Wittig reaction. Because phosphonium ylides are seldom isolated, the byproduct(s) generated upon deprotonation essentially plays the role of an additive in a Wittig reaction. As a result, the choice of base has a strong influence on the efficiency and, when applicable, the stereochemical outcome of the Wittig reaction. \n\nOne of the simplest ylide is methylenetriphenylphosphorane (PhP=CH). It is also a precursor to more elaborate Wittig reagents. Alkylation of PhP=CH with a primary alkyl halide R−CH−X, produces substituted phosphonium salts:\nThese salts can be deprotonated in the usual way to give PhP=CH−CHR.\n\nThe Wittig reagent may be described in the phosphorane form (the more familiar representation) or the ylide form:\n\nThe ylide form is a significant contributor, and the carbon atom is nucleophilic.\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a popular method for the synthesis of alkene from ketones and aldehydes. The Wittig reagent can generally tolerate carbonyl compounds containing several kinds of functional groups such as OH, OR, aromatic nitro and even ester groups . There can be a problem with sterically hindered ketones, where the reaction may be slow and give poor yields, particularly with stabilized ylides, and in such cases the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons (HWE) reaction (using phosphonate esters) is preferred. Another reported limitation is the often labile nature of aldehydes which can oxidize, polymerize or decompose. In a so-called tandem oxidation-Wittig process the aldehyde is formed in situ by oxidation of the corresponding alcohol.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Wittig reagent itself is usually derived from a primary alkyl halide. Quaternization of triphenylphosphine with most secondary halides is inefficient. For this reason, Wittig reagents are rarely used to prepare tetrasubstituted alkenes. However the Wittig reagent can tolerate many other variants. It may contain alkenes and aromatic rings, and it is compatible with ethers and even ester groups. Even C=O and nitrile groups can be present if conjugated with the ylide- these are the stabilised ylides mentioned above. Bis-ylides (containing two P=C bonds) have also been made and used successfully.\n\nOne limitation relates to the stereochemistry of the product. With simple ylides, the product is usually mainly the Z-isomer, although a lesser amount of the E-isomer is often formed also – this is particularly true when ketones are used. If the reaction is performed in dimethylformamide in the presence of lithium iodide or sodium iodide, the product is almost exclusively the Z-isomer. If the E-isomer is the desired product, the Schlosser modification may be used. With stabilised ylides the product is mainly the E-isomer, and this same isomer is also usual with the HWE reaction.\n\nThe main limitation of the traditional Wittig reaction is that the reaction proceeds mainly via the erythro betaine intermediate, which leads to the Z-alkene. The erythro betaine can be converted to the threo betaine using phenyllithium at low temperature. This modification affords the E-alkene.\n\nAllylic alcohols can be prepared by reaction of the betaine ylide with a second aldehyde. For example:\n\nBecause of its reliability and wide applicability, the Wittig reaction has become a standard tool for synthetic organic chemists.\n\nThe most popular use of the Wittig reaction is for the introduction of a methylene group using methylenetriphenylphosphorane (PhP=CH). Using this reagent, even a sterically hindered ketone such as camphor can be converted to its methylene derivative. In this case, the Wittig reagent is prepared \"in situ\" by deprotonation of methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide with potassium tert-butoxide. In another example, the phosphorane is produced using sodium amide as a base, and this reagent converts the aldehyde shown into alkene I in 62% yield. The reaction is performed in cold THF, and the sensitive nitro, azo and phenoxide groups are tolerated. The product can be used to incorporate a photostabiliser into a polymer, to protect the polymer from damage by ultraviolet radiation.\n\nAnother example of its use is in the synthesis of leukotriene A methyl ester. The first step uses a stabilised ylide, where the carbonyl group is conjugated with the ylide preventing self condensation, although unexpectedly this gives mainly the \"cis\" product. The second Wittig reaction uses a non-stabilised Wittig reagent, and as expected this gives mainly the \"cis\" product. Note that the epoxide and ester functional groups survive intact.\n\nMethoxymethylenetriphenylphosphine is a Wittig reagent for the homologation of aldehydes and ketones. After the Wittig reaction, hydrolysis of the methoxyalkene gives an enol, which tautomerizes to an aldehyde.\n\nThe Wittig reaction was reported in 1954 by Georg Wittig and his coworker Ulrich Schöllkopf. In part for this contribution, Wittig was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1837754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837754", "title": "Loop optimization", "text": "Loop optimization\n\nIn compiler theory, loop optimization is the process of increasing execution speed and reducing the overheads associated with loops. It plays an important role in improving cache performance and making effective use of parallel processing capabilities. Most execution time of a scientific program is spent on loops; as such, many compiler optimization techniques have been developed to make them faster.\n\nSince instructions inside loops can be executed repeatedly, it is frequently not possible to give a bound on the number of instruction executions that will be impacted by a loop optimization. This presents challenges when reasoning about the correctness and benefits of a loop optimization, specifically the representations of the computation being optimized and the optimization(s) being performed.\n\nLoop optimization can be viewed as the application of a sequence of specific loop transformations (listed below or in \"Compiler transformations for high-performance computing\") to the source code or intermediate representation, with each transformation having an associated test for legality. A transformation (or sequence of transformations) generally must preserve the temporal sequence of all dependencies if it is to preserve the result of the program (i.e., be a legal transformation). Evaluating the benefit of a transformation or sequence of transformations can be quite difficult within this approach, as the application of one beneficial transformation may require the prior use of one or more other transformations that, by themselves, would result in reduced performance.\n\nCommon loop transformations include:\n\nThe unimodular transformation approach uses a single unimodular matrix to describe the combined result of a sequence of many of the above transformations. Central to this approach is the view of the set of all executions of a statement within \"n\" loops as a set of integer points in an \"n\"-dimensional space, with the points being executed in lexicographical order. For example, the executions of a statement nested inside an outer loop with index \"i\" and an inner loop with index \"j\" can be associated with the pairs of integers . The application of a unimodular transformation corresponds to the multiplication of the points within this space by the matrix. For example, the interchange of two loops corresponds to the matrix formula_1.\n\nA unimodular transformation is legal if it preserves the temporal sequence of all dependencies; measuring the performance impact of a unimodular transformation is more difficult. Imperfectly nested loops and some transformations (such as tiling) do not fit easily into this framework.\n\nThe polyhedral model handles a wider class of programs and transformations than the unimodular framework. The set of executions of a set of statements within a possibly imperfectly nested set of loops is seen as the union of a set of polytopes representing the executions of the statements. Affine transformations are applied to these polytopes, producing a description of a new execution order. The boundaries of the polytopes, the data dependencies, and the transformations are often described using systems of constraints, and this approach is often referred to as a constraint-based approach to loop optimization. For example, a single statement within an outer loop \" and an inner loop \" is executed once for each pair such that .\n\nOnce again, a transformation is legal if it preserves the temporal sequence of all dependencies. Estimating the benefits of a transformation, or finding the best transformation for a given code on a given computer, remain the subject of ongoing research as of the time of this writing (2010).\n\n"}

Grammar School and at King's College, Lagos.\nThe influence of his father and Dr T. K. Ekundayo Phillips (composer, organist and choirmaster) was an important factor in his early years. At that time, Sowande was a chorister and was introduced to new Yoruba works being introduced into the churches. During that period, he studied organ under Phillips (including works by Bach and European classical masters), and earned the Fellowship Diploma (FRCO) from the Royal College of Organists. At that time, he was also a bandleader, playing jazz and popular highlife music. All of these had considerable influence on his work.\n\nIn 1934 Sowande went to London to study European classical and popular music. In 1936, he was solo pianist in a performance of George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\". He also played as duo-pianist with Fats Waller, and was theatre organist for the BBC as organist and Choirmaster at Kingsway Hall (unfortunately recently demolished) London and as pianist in the 1936 production of \"Blackbirds\". In 1939, he played organ in some recordings by Adelaide Hall and Dame Vera Lynn. Later, he studied organ privately under Edmund Rubbra, George Oldroyd, and George Cunningham and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists in 1943, winning the Limpus, Harding and Read Prizes.\n\nHe also won several prizes and obtained a Bachelor of Music degree at the University of London and became a Fellow of Trinity College of Music. He also worked as musical advisor for the Colonial Film Unit of the Ministry of Information during the Second World War, providing background music for educational films.\n\nFrom 1945, he was a renowned organist and choirmaster at the West London Mission of the Methodist Church until 1952, and a considerable amount of organ music dates from this period. These are based on Nigerian melodies that gave a special appeal to the Black members of his congregation in the early years of migration from the African continent and the Caribbean. Also during this time, he became known as a dance pianist, bandleader, and Hammond organist, playing popular tunes of the day.\n\nWestern and African ideas prevail in his music which included organ works such as \"Yorùbá Lament\", \"Obangiji\", \"Kyrie\", \"Gloria\", \"Jesu Olugbala\", and \"Oba Aba Ke Pe\". Most of these show a strong influence of Anglican Church music combined with Yoruba pentatonic melodies.\n\nHis orchestral works include \"Six Sketches for Full Orchestra\", \"A Folk Symphony\", and \"African Suite\" for string orchestra, and show African rhythmic and harmonic characteristics. The final movement of \"African Suite\" became known to Canadian audiences as the theme of the popular CBC music programme \"Gilmour's Albums\", and is now a Canadian orchestral standard. He also wrote a significant amount of secular and sacred choral music, mainly a cappella. Some of these works were composed during his period with the BBC Africa Service. He went back to Nigeria to scholarly work with the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation and later the University of Ibadan. He was appointed MBE in the 1955 Queen's Birthday Honours for his work in the Nigerian Broadcasting Service . In 1968 he moved to Howard University in Washington, D.C., then the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the last years of his life Sowande taught in the Department of Pan-African Studies at Kent State University, and lived in nearby Ravenna, Ohio with his wife, Eleanor McKinney, who was one of the founders of Pacifica Radio. He died in Ravenna and is buried in Randolph Township, Ohio.\n\nIn addition to his position as a professor, Sowande also held the chieftaincy title of the Bariyo of Lagos.\n\nThere is currently a move to set up a centre to research and promote his works, as many remain unpublished or are out of print.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The work follows the exploits of Spartacus, the leader of the slave uprising against the Romans known as the Third Servile War, although the ballet's storyline takes considerable liberties with the historical record. Khachaturian composed Spartacus in 1954, and was awarded a Lenin Prize for the composition that same year. It was first staged, with choreography by Leonid Yakobson, in Leningrad 1956, but only with qualified success since Yakobson abandoned conventional \"pointe\" in his choreography. The ballet received its first staging at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow in 1958, choreographed by Igor Moiseyev; however it was the 1968 production, choreographed by Yury Grigorovich, which achieved the greatest acclaim for the ballet. It remains one of Khachaturian's best known works and is prominent within the repertoires of the Bolshoi Theatre and other ballet companies in Russia and the former Soviet Union.\n\nPrincipal Characters:\n\n\nThe Roman consul Crassus returns to Rome from his latest conquests in a triumphal procession. Among his captives are the Thracian king Spartacus and his wife Phrygia. Spartacus laments his captivity and bids a bitter farewell to Phrygia, who is taken off to join Crassus’ harem of concubines. To entertain Crassus and his entourage, Spartacus is sent into the gladiatorial ring and is forced to kill a close friend. Horrified at his deed, Spartacus incites his fellow captives to rebellion.\n\nThe escaped captives celebrate their freedom. Meanwhile, Crassus entertains the Roman patricians with lavish entertainment. Spartacus and the other escaped captives disrupt the orgy and rescue the slave women, including Phrygia. Aegina insists that Crassus pursue the slave army immediately. The lovers celebrate their escape to the \"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\".\n\nAegina discovers Spartacus’s camp and observes the lovers emerging from their tent the next morning. Aegina sends word to Crassus, who sends his army in pursuit. Internecine struggles break out among Spartacus’s forces. Finally, Crassus’s forces discover Spartacus and impale him upon their spears. Spartacus’s closest followers recover his body and carry it off while Phrygia mourns her loss.\n\nKhachaturian extracted and arranged music from the ballet in 1955 for four orchestral suites:\n2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons; 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba; timpani, percussion ; strings.\n\n\n"}

During this early stage of his career, Brothers found much success on MySpace, where he amassed over 8 million plays and 100,000 fans on his music page.\n\nWhile many artists focus their efforts on radio exposure, Brothers went a slightly different route and pushed to get songs out to the public through film and television shows as part of a generation of similar-minded indie artists in the United States. Brothers' songs have appeared on the medical dramas \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"Private Practice\" and \"ER\", \"Scrubs\", \"Cougar Town\", the Fox mystery \"Bones\", WB's \"Smallville\", USA Network comedy \"Psych\", ABC Family's show \"Kyle XY\", \"One Tree Hill\", \"Where We're Meant to Be\", and the hit Emma Stone comedy Easy A. The original version of Brothers' song \"Ride\" appeared on the soundtrack to the feature film \"The Last Kiss\" alongside Coldplay and Ray Lamontagne. Brothers has also performed on \"The Late Late Show\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and Direct TV's \"CD USA\". In 2005, he made a guest appearance with the London artist Aqualung on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" and \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\".\n\nBrothers plays regularly as part of the musical community at the Hotel Café in Los Angeles, and he has since toured across America and Canada with such acts as Greg Laswell, Sara Bareilles, Liz Phair, KT Tunstall, Aqualung, Ben Lee, Matt Nathanson, Imogen Heap, and The Fray. In addition to his career as a musician, he co-created The Hotel Cafe Tour, which ran for 4 years in both the U.S. and Europe. Brothers also co-produced Joshua Radin's first EP and the song \"Winter\" from Radin's record \"We Were Here\".\n\nIn 2007, Cary Brothers signed a record deal with indie label Bluhammock Music for the release of his first full-length album, \"Who You Are\", on May 29, 2007, which made the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. Produced by Chad Fischer (Alexi Murdoch) and mixed by Greg Collins (Grammy Winner – U2), the record features guest musicians Matt Hales from Aqualung and Priscilla Ahn. The video for the single \"Ride\" starring Brittany Snow was added to the rotation on VH1 in the U.S. In addition, the record won \"Best Rock Album of 2007\" by the Indie Acoustic Project. Brothers' track 'Ride' has also been mixed by Tiësto and was a success on the dancefloors of Europe in 2008. He helped close Friday night at Bonnaroo in the summer of 2008 by making a guest appearance with Tiësto and repeated this musical pairing a few months later at the O2 arena in London.\n\nIn 2009, Brothers went into the studio to work on his second full-length record.

Hofacker assessed the chances of the coup attempt as \"only ten percent\". He had a point of introduction to Field Marshal Erwin Rommel as he considered his father something of a hero, having served under him in World War I. He tried to draw him into the plot to rid Germany of Hitler, but although Rommel gave his backing to the conspiracy he did not agree that he should be killed.\n\nOn 26 July 1944, Hofacker was arrested in Paris, taken to Berlin Gestapo headquarters where, according to William Shirer in \"The Rise and Fall of the 3rd Reich\", he was horrifically tortured and gave up the name of Erwin Rommel stating that Rommel said to \"Tell the people in Berlin they can count on me\". This was support for the conspiracy to overthrow Hitler, not to kill him- but this made no difference to Hitler who ordered the forced suicide of Erwin Rommel and false hero's funeral. The torture confession was taken down and Hofacker was put on trial before the \"Volksgerichtshof\". He was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. He was hanged at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin.\n"}
{"id": "1837923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1837923", "title": "Loop interchange", "text": "Loop interchange\n\nIn compiler theory, loop interchange is the process of exchanging the order of two iteration variables used by a nested loop. The variable used in the inner loop switches to the outer loop, and vice versa. It is often done to ensure that the elements of a multi-dimensional array are accessed in the order in which they are present in memory, improving locality of reference.\n\nFor example, in the code fragment:\n\nloop interchange would result in:\n\nOn occasion, such a transformation may create opportunities to further optimize, such as automatic vectorization of the array assignments.\n\nThe major purpose of loop interchange is to take advantage of the CPU cache when accessing array elements. When a processor accesses an array element for the first time, it will retrieve an entire block of data from memory to cache. That block is likely to have many more consecutive elements after the first one, so on the next array element access, it will be brought directly from cache (which is faster than getting it from slow main memory). Cache misses occur if the contiguously accessed array elements within the loop come from a different cache block, and loop interchange can help prevent this. The effectiveness of loop interchange depends on and must be considered in light of the cache model used by the underlying hardware and the array model used by the compiler.\n\nIn C programming language, array elements in the same row are stored consecutively in memory (a[1,1], a[1,2], a[1,3]) ‒ in row-major order. On the other hand, FORTRAN programs store array elements from the same column together (a[1,1], a[2,1], a[3,1]), using column-major. Thus the order of two iteration variables in the first example is suitable for a C program while the second example is better for FORTRAN. Optimizing compilers can detect the improper ordering by programmers and interchange the order to achieve better cache performance.\n\nLike any compiler optimization, loop interchange may lead to worse performance because cache performance is only part of the story. Take the following example:\n\nLoop interchange on this example can improve the cache performance of accessing b(j,i), but it will ruin the reuse of a(i) and c(i) in the inner loop, as it introduces two extra loads (for a(i) and for c(i)) and one extra store (for a(i)) during each iteration. As a result, the overall performance may be degraded after loop interchange.\n\nIt is not always safe to exchange the iteration variables due to dependencies between statements for the order in which they must execute. To determine whether a compiler can safely interchange loops, dependence analysis is required.\n\n"}

The Bunkhouse Stampede was a regular battle royal where the wrestlers wore \"bunkhouse gear\" (blue jeans and cowboy boots, etc.) to the match, similar to 'street fight' matches. Weapons were also allowed. For example, Ivan and Nikita Koloff brought their chains to the ring, and The Road Warriors brought their spikes, others used trash can lids and leather straps. To win this match, a wrestler had to be the last one in the ring, with all of the other wrestlers having been thrown over the top rope. These were most often bloody matches, as there were several weapons involved.\n\nEach year, there were several Bunkhouse Stampedes held in the prior weeks, with the winners of each one going to the final Bunkhouse Stampede to battle for the championship. They began in 1985, and the last was held in 1989, after which it was abandoned. The winner was awarded a large bronze cowboy boot.\n\nThe format was slightly different in 1987; rather than have all of the champions meet in a final match, it was decided that whoever won the most matches during the tour would be declared the champion. When Dusty Rhodes and Big Bubba Rogers ended up tied after the final match in San Francisco (itself marred by the fact that the last two wrestlers in the ring were The Road Warriors, but they tossed a coin and the loser jumped out of the ring), a two-man steel cage bunkhouse match (where one wrestler had to throw the other out of the cage) between the two determined the overall winner, over Jim Cornette's protests that Rogers should have been declared the winner because, while Rhodes had won as many of the matches, Rogers had won more money (because while most of the matches had $25,000 prizes, Rogers won a $100,000 match in Atlanta).\n\nOnly one of the earlier Bunkhouse Stampedes, on December 28, 1985, was broadcast on NWA Television, but it was cut off after only a few minutes of action.

The text contains visions by Bartholomew, and acts of Thomas, but is predominantly about The Passion, and the Eucharist. The text seems to have no semblance of gnostic interpretations, and instead appears to be a text aiming to fill in the supernatural details of the Passion, and to emphasise the value and meaning of church liturgy.\n\nThe text starts with a description of Jesus' own rather gory comprehension of his own fate, i.e. the crucifixion. It is followed by a tale in which someone attempts to stand in for Jesus (i.e. die in his place), but the priests are initially unable to kill him, even though they try stoning and putting him in an oven.\n\nSubsequently, the text describes Jesus descending into hell, finding Judas Iscariot there, and preaching to him. Jesus then rescues everyone from hell, except for Judas, Cain, and Herod the Great. This is followed by a flashback described by a gardener to the night when angels, fiery chariots, and God, descended to earth, and resurrected Jesus.\n\nBartholomew is present at the scene, and is shown the highest level of heaven so that he can see the liturgy going on there to celebrate the resurrection. Bartholomew then has a flashback about a divine visitation at the Mount of Olives.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas is busy resurrecting \"Siophanes\" (possibly a transcription error and meant to read \"Theophanes\"), his son. On returning to life, Siophanes describes what the afterlife was like, while Thomas proceeds to baptise all of the amazed townsfolk, who number some 12,000.\n\nFinally, in order to witness the ascension of Jesus, Thomas is brought to the others via a cloud. At this point Thomas is surprised to see Jesus resurrected (despite having just brought his own son back to life), and celebrates the eucharist with the other apostles. Then they disperse to evangelise.\n\n"}

He was also a member of the U.S. national basketball team.\n\nStanding tall and weighing , Redd spent both his collegiate and professional career at the shooting guard position.\n\nRedd was born on August 24, 1979, in Columbus, Ohio. In his college years, Redd spent three years leading the offensive attack of Ohio State University garnering point averages of 21.9, 19.5, and 17.5, respectively. As a sophomore, Redd and Scoonie Penn led Ohio State to the NCAA Final Four. He was then drafted after his junior year in the 2000 NBA draft as a second round pick (43rd overall) by the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nIn his rookie year, Redd was not able to contribute immediately as he was behind NBA All-Star guard Ray Allen on the depth chart. Later on, however, it became apparent that he was better than anticipated as proven by accounts that he had played extremely well against Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson, and other teammates in practice. It was then that former Bucks' head coach George Karl rewarded him with additional playing time. He posted averages of 11.4 points per contest as well as 44.4% on three-point shooting during his second NBA season. On February 20, 2002, against the Houston Rockets, Redd made eight three-point field goals in the fourth quarter, a then-NBA record. In October 2002, he signed a four-year, $12 million offer sheet with the Dallas Mavericks, but it was matched by the Bucks and he remained in Milwaukee. During the 2003–04 season, Redd's performance, amongst other reasons (ouster of Ray Allen to Seattle via a trade), was rewarded with full starter's duties and later earning averages of 21.7 points per contest en route to his first and only All-Star Game appearance.\n\nAfter the 2004–05 season, Redd signed a new contract with the Bucks that lasted six years and was worth $91 million. He chose to stay with the Bucks over leaving for his home state team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and a chance to play for less money with LeBron James.\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, Redd had the best season of his career. He averaged a career-high 26.7 points per game and set a Bucks' record for most points in a game, with 57.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks were dealt a devastating blow January 25, 2009, when they learned Redd would miss the rest of the season with a torn ACL and MCL in his left knee. Redd missed the rest of the 2008–09 season.\n\nRedd returned for the Bucks to start the 2009–10 season, but during a game against the Los Angeles Lakers on January 10, 2010, he re-tore his ACL and MCL in the same knee that he had injured almost a year earlier. It was announced the next day that he would once again be lost for the rest of the season.\n\nOn March 28, 2011, Redd was able to return to the Bucks after 14 months from the injury and recorded four assists in his return. On March 30, 2011, against the Toronto Raptors, Redd scored his first NBA basket since his return from injury. Redd played 10 games in the 2010–11 season. When he left Milwaukee, he had averaged 20 points per game in his 11 seasons with the team.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns signed Redd to a one-year contract on December 29, 2011. Redd made his debut for Phoenix on January 12, 2012, scoring 14 points in a loss to the Cavaliers. Redd returned to Milwaukee on February 7, 2012, scoring 14 points in the win over the Bucks. He received a standing ovation from the crowd.

He is the author of eight books on the Holocaust and related subjects.\n\nMarrus was born in Toronto and received his BA at the University of Toronto in 1963 and his MA and PhD at the University of California, Berkeley in 1964 and 1968. He also received a master's degree in law from the University of Toronto in 2005. Marrus was Professor of History and Dean of Graduate Studies at the University of Toronto and served for nineteen years as Governor of the institution. He was a senior fellow of Massey College until 2017 and is the Chancellor Rose and Ray Wolfe Professor Emeritus of Holocaust Studies.\n\nIn 1981 Marrus co-authored with Robert Paxton \"Vichy France and the Jews\" which demonstrated that the anti-semitism of Vichy France was endogenous to the region rather than imposed from without and that the Vichy government, which was spared occupation for a time, could sometimes be even more brutal than states which, unlike Vichy, were actually under Nazi occupation, especially in its role in organizing the deportation of Jews to death camps.\n\nAmong Marrus' best-known books, \"The Holocaust in History\" (1987) applies the tools of historiographic analysis to the vast literature on the topic, attempting to elucidate such issues as the problems of the uniqueness and universalism of the Holocaust; public opinion regarding the Jews in Nazi Europe; anti-semitism as a factor in the origins of the Holocaust; Jewish resistance; the role of the Judenräte; bystanders; and role of the churches in the Holocaust. He has also written on the history of European refugee movements in the twentieth century, and the Holocaust-era restitution campaign of the 1990s.\n\nMarrus' most recent work, \"Lessons of the Holocaust\", published in 2015, deals with the historical and moral controversies which infuse the interpretation of the Holocaust and its significance. In it, Marrus denies there can be any definitive set of lessons to be learned from the destruction of the European Jews and instead affirms that there are many ever-evolving questions that need to be continually studied and re-interpreted. His works have been translated into French, German, Polish, Hebrew, Portuguese, and Japanese.\n\nIn October 1999 Marrus was one of three Jewish scholars appointed to the International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission to investigate the role of the Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust.\n\nThe commission was supposed to review and discuss the previously published Vatican records pertaining to the World War II period and report on their assessment. In October 2000 the Commission issued a preliminary report with 47 questions about the Vatican's response to the Holocaust. Thereupon, in 2001, the Vatican rebuffed the Commission's efforts to access Vatican archives of the Pontificate of Pius XII and the wartime period, and it subsequently disbanded amid controversy. In an interview in the \"Jerusalem Post\" Marrus expressed regret that the Commission had run \"up against a brick wall\" on the question of opening Vatican archives.\n\nOn September 26, 2017, at a lunch at Massey College, Hugh Segal, who then had the title of Master of Massey College, joined Marrus and other students at the table, including a black student. Marrus then remarked, \"You know this is your 'Master,' eh? Do you feel the lash?\" Marrus apologized for the comment and resigned from his position as a Senior Fellow of the college on October 1, 2017 in a letter to Segal, the head of the college, stating his \"deepest regrets to all whom I may have harmed.\" He added, \"I am so sorry for what I said, in a poor effort at jocular humour... I want to assure those who heard me … that while I had no ill-intent whatsoever I can appreciate how those at the table and those who have learned about it could take offence at what I said.\"\n\nIn 1971, Marrus married Randi Greenstein; the couple has three children.\n\nMarrus' books have received many prizes and distinctions, including the 1982 National Jewish Book Award in the Holocaust category for \"Vichy France and the Jews\" and more recently, a Canadian Jewish Book Award for \"Lessons of the Holocaust\". He has been a research fellow or has taught at St. Antony's College, Oxford, at Israel Institute for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, at UCLA, and at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the Royal Historical Society. In 2008 he became a member of the Order of Canada.\n\n\n"}

Adjacent to \"Explorer\" were two solid rocket boosters mated to a full-size mock-up of an external tank (originally used by Stennis Space Center for fit tests).\n\nBecause KSC was to receive the retired \"Atlantis\", Space Shuttle \"Explorer\" was removed from the KSC Visitor Center on December 11, 2011, and relocated to the Vehicle Assembly Building's turn basin dock adjacent to the Launch Complex 39 Press Site. The move was performed by Beyel Bros. using a 144-wheel trailer towed by truck. To accommodate the shuttle, several light poles and street signage along the route were taken down, and the shuttle itself was lifted by hydraulic jacks over a KSC guardhouse.\n\nThe vehicle remained at the turn basin until May 24, 2012, when it began its move by barge to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center outside Houston, Texas. The replica shuttle was stripped of the name \"Explorer\" as part of the dismantling process.\n\nUpon arriving in the Houston area by barge on June 1, 2012, the shuttle was taken to the Johnson Space Center dock on Clear Lake, and preparations were made to move the shuttle to Space Center Houston during the early morning hours. As with Florida, several light poles along NASA Parkway were taken down and trees trimmed back to allow passage. The shuttle was moved by another 144-wheel trailer down the closed highway to the visitor center.\n\nJohnson Space Center hosted a celebration for the arrival of the replica. \"Shuttlebration\" events began on June 1, at the southeast corner of Clear Lake by the Nassau Bay Hilton Hotel. The festivities included the arrival of the shuttle at the dock and its move onto visitor center grounds. This was the largest item to arrive at the JSC dock since a Saturn V arrived for display in 1977.\n\nSpace Center Houston announced on May 2, 2013, that it had acquired NASA 905, one of NASA's two modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. The center planned to display the replica shuttle atop the SCA with interiors of both vehicles accessible to visitors. A competition to name the shuttle opened on July 4, 2013, and concluded on September 2, 2013, with over 10,000 entries received. The winning entry was submitted by Timothy Judd, and the new name, \"Independence\", was revealed on October 5, 2013.\n\n\"Independence\" underwent extensive renovation in 2013 and 2014 to repair damaged components and update its appearance to more closely match that of the modern shuttle fleet. Modifications include a re-skinning of the exterior, replica thermal tiles, publicly accessible mid-deck and payload bay, a glass cockpit on the flight deck, and display cases with shuttle program artifacts.\n\nOn August 14, 2014, a heavy lift was completed to place \"Independence\" on top of NASA 905, which had been moved to Space Center Houston from Ellington Field on April 30, 2014. The combined exhibit, named \"Independence Plaza\", opened to the public on January 23, 2016, at an estimated cost of .\n\n"}

An approximate date given to the Acts of Paul is 160 CE. The Acts were first mentioned by Tertullian. Tertullian found it heretical because it encouraged women to preach and baptize. The Acts were considered orthodox by Hippolytus but were eventually regarded as heretical when the Manichaeans started using the texts. The author of the Acts of Paul is unknown and wrote out of respect for Paul in Asia Minor. The author does not show any dependency on the canonical Acts but uses oral traditions of Paul's missionary work.\n\nThe text is primarily known from Greek manuscripts. The discovery of a Coptic version of the text demonstrated that the text was composed of\n\nAll of these constituent parts were often considered worth treating as separate texts and frequently appeared independently, although scholars agree that they were originally part of the \"Acts of Paul\". Besides the four main sections mentioned above, the remainder of the Acts exist only in fragments from the 3rd and 5th centuries:\n\nThe texts are a coherent whole and are generally thought to have been written by one author using oral traditions, rather than basing it on any of the other apocrypha or the orthodox canon. The main emphasis of the text is on Chastity and anti-Gnosticism. According to Tertullian, the author was a priest in Asia Minor. While the priest encouraged female ministry, he expressed doctrinal orthodoxy in regard to continence and Resurrection. Also, they mentioned the close relationship of sexual purity and salvation.\n\nThe Epistle of the Corinthians to Paul and the Third Epistle of the Corinthians both appear in some editions of the Armenian Bible.\n\nActs of Paul consists of the third letter to the Corinthians, an account of his martyrdom, and other narratives depicting his preaching and activity. There is a range of literature either about or purporting to be by Paul, including letters, narratives, prayers, and apocalypses. The pseudonymous Third Letter to the Corinthians claims to have been written from prison to correct the misinterpretations that his first and second letter had created. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he stated that \"flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God\" and this statement is related to the debates that ensued between the Gnostic and proto-orthodox Christians thereafter. A Christian who was concerned to emphasize that people would be physically resurrected, rather than merely spiritually, forged 3 Corinthians to counter Gnostic teachings. The Acts of Paul also appear to be familiar with the traditional account about the martyrdom of Peter, in which, having been arrested and condemned to death, Peter asked to be crucified head-down because he wasn't worthy of having the same death as Jesus.\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated on Toetoes Bay at the mouth of the Mataura River, and is on the far western edge of the Catlins. Nearby settlements include Otara to the southeast, Pukewao and Tokanui to the northeast, and Titiroa and Waimahaka to the north.\n\nFrom 1834 to 1836, whalers lived at a station in the Fortrose area, and the first surveys for a town - slightly to the west of Fortrose's present location - gave it the name of Russelltown. In the mid-19th century, Fortrose acquired its current name, a tribute to Fortrose in Scotland, from a Scottish drover. Its location at the Mataura's mouth meant it developed as a port to service the local region, and in 1875, a long jetty was built. However, Fortrose's economy declined after the Tokanui Branch railway was opened to Waimahaka in 1899 and then Tokanui in 1911, as the railway provided much quicker transportation for freight to Invercargill.\n\nA number of Fortrose residents fought overseas in World War I and World War II. Six were killed in the former and two in the latter. A round obelisk stands in Fortrose as a memorial to the deceased; it was unveiled in 1922 in honour of the World War I victims, with the names of the World War II casualties added later.\n\nIn the 19th century, goods such as grain, logs, and wool were significant in the local economy. After its early 20th century decline, it is now reviving somewhat as 'The Gateway to the Catlins'.\n\n"}
{"id": "1838014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838014", "title": "Hinduism in Malaysia", "text": "Hinduism in Malaysia\n\nHinduism is the fourth largest religion in Malaysia. About 1.78 million Malaysian residents (6.3% of the total population) are Hindus, according to 2010 Census of Malaysia. This is up from 1,380,400 (6.2% of the total population) in 2000.\n\nMost Malaysian Hindus are settled in western parts of Peninsular Malaysia. There are 3 states in Malaysia which qualify to be a Hindu enclave, where the Hindu percentage is greater than 10% of the population. The Malaysian state with highest percentage of Hindus, according to 2010 Census, is Selangor (13.4%), followed by Negeri Sembilan (11.6%), Perak (10.9%) and Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (8.5%). The first three mentioned technically count as being Hindu enclaves. The state with the least percentage of Hindu population is Sabah (0.1%).\n\nIndians, along with other ethnic groups such as Chinese, began arriving in Malaysia in the ancient and medieval era. In 2010, Malaysian Census reported there were 1.91 million citizens of Indian ethnic origin. About 1.64 million of Indian ethnic group Malaysians (86%) are Hindus. About 0.14 million non-Indian ethnic group Malaysian people also profess being Hindus.\n\nMalaysia gained its independence from the British colonial empire in 1957, thereafter declared its official state religion as Islam, and adopted a constitution that is mixed. On one hand, it protects freedom of religion (such as the practice of Hinduism), but on the other hand Malaysian constitution also restricts religious freedom. In recent decades, there have been increasing reports of religious persecution of Hindus, along with other minority religions, by various state governments of Malaysia and its Sharia courts. Hindu temples built on private property, and built long before Malaysian independence, have been demolished by Malaysian government officials in recent years.\n\nSimilar to the Indonesian Archipelago, the native Malays practised an indigenous animism and dynamism beliefs before the arrival of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam.\nIt is unclear when the first Indian voyages across the Bay of Bengal occurred. Conservative estimates place the earliest arrivals to Malay shores at least 1,700 years ago. The growth of trade with India brought coastal people in much of the Malay world into contact with Hinduism. Thus, Hinduism, Indian cultural traditions and the Sanskrit language began to spread across the land. Temples were built in the Indian style and local kings began referring to themselves as \"Raja\" and more desirable aspects of Indian government were adopted.\n\nSubsequently, small Hindu Malay states started to appear in the coastal areas of Malay peninsular notably the Gangga Negara (2nd century), Langkasuka (2nd century), and Kedah (4th century). Between 7th and 13th centuries many of these small, often prosperous peninsular maritime trading states came under the loose control of Srivijaya empire, a great Hindu Malay kingdom centred in Palembang, Sumatra.\n\nMany Indian settlers came to Malaya from South India during the British colonial rule from early 19th through the mid 20th century. Many came to escape poverty and famines in British India, and work as indentured labourers in initially tin mining operations and coffee, sugar plantations, and later rubber plantations; they worked with immigrant Chinese laborers on these sites. Some English-educated Indians were appointed to more professional positions. Most were hired through British colonial labor offices in Nagapattinam or Madras (now Chennai).\n\nIn the early years, the retention rates of Hindus in Malaysia were low and with time, fewer Hindus volunteered to live in Malaysia. The colonial rule adopted a \"Kangani\" system of recruitment, where the trusted Hindu worker was encouraged and rewarded for recruiting friends and family from India to work in British operations in Malaysia. The family and friends peer pressure reduced labor turnover and increased permanent migration into Malaysia. The \"Kangani\" system led to vast majority of Hindus coming from certain parts of South Indian Hindu community. So concentrated was the immigration from South India, that the British colonial Malayan Administration named laws to highlight the focussed group, and enacted the \"Tamil\" Immigration Fund Ordinance in 1907. A minority of Indian immigrants to Malaysia during this period came from Northern India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Malaysian Hindu workers during the British era were among the most marginalised. They were forced to live in closed plantation societies in frontier zones and the plantation symbolised the boundary of their existence. Racial segregation was enforced, and British anti-vagrancy laws made it illegal for Indian Hindus (and Chinese Buddhists) to enter the more developed European zoned regions. The Hindus spoke neither English nor Malay languages and remained confined to interacting within their own community.\n\nAfter Malaysia gained independence in 1957, local governments favored autochthonous \"Bumiputera\" and refused automatic citizenship to Indians and Chinese ethnic groups who had been living in Malaysia for decades during British colonial era. They were declared illegal aliens and they could not apply for government jobs or own land. Sectarian riots followed, targeting Indians and Chinese, such as the 1957 Chingay riot in Penang, 1964 Malaysian racial riots, the 1967 Hartal riots, and 13 May 1969 riots. Singapore, which in the early 1960s was part of Malaysia, seceded from the union and became an independent city-state. The Malaysian government passed a 1970 constitutional amendment and then the 1971 Sedition law that made it illegal to publicly discuss Malaysian citizenship methodology, national language policy, the definition of ethnic Malays as automatically Muslims, and the legitimacy of Sultans in each Malaysian state.\n\nTo safeguard the interest of the Hindu organisations and Hindu temples, the Malaysia Hindu Sangam (MHS) was formed on 23 January 1965. The formation of MHS was greatly due to the ingenuity of the late Shri K. Paramalingam KMN., a barrister at law and was then the Director General of Public Trustee Department, assisted by the late Shri K. Ramanathan, Shri. G. V. Thevar, Shri Hari Chand Saradha, Shri. S. Palanivel Pillai, and Shri S. Dhuraiappah. Shri K. Ramanathan also was the president of Malaysian Indian Congress from 1950 - 1951 and the founder of Malaysian Arulneri Thirukkuttam.\n\nMalaysia Hindu Sangam is the only Hindu organization that the government of Malaysia consults on matters affecting the Hindu community in Malaysia. It is also a member of the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST) since 1984. MCCBCHST is composed primarily of officials from the main non-Muslim communities in Malaysia and acts as a consultative and liaison body towards more open dialogue and co-operation.\nMalaysia Hindu Sangam has organised many national Hindu conferences, seminars, Antharyogams and religious discussions and created a strong religious awareness among the Malaysian Hindus. Among the great contribution of MHS towards the upliftment of Hindus in Malaysia was the Gurukal training programme in the 1980s to train local young men as temple priests.\n\nSiddhas have traveled to then Malaya and performed austerities and eventually went into Jeeva Samadhi. Jeganatha Swamigal, a disciple of Ramalinga Adigal, is foremost among a handful of saints who ventured to the then Malaya. Jeganatha Swamigal's Samadhi is located at Tapah, Perak. Presently, the Jeganatha Swamigal's Samadhi and the land adjacent to its temple is managed by Malaysia Hindu Sangam. A new temple enshrining the image of Sri Jeganathar Swami is being erected. \n\nOther popular Samadhi is of Sannasi Andavar in Cheng, Malacca and Mauna Swamigal in the vicinity of Lord Saturn's temple at Batu Caves.\n\nMalaysian Hinduism is diverse, with large urban temples dedicated to specific deities, and smaller temples located on estates. The estate temples generally follow the tradition of the Indian region from which the temples' worshippers originate. Many people follow the Shaivite, or Saivite, tradition (worship of Shiva), of Southern India. However, there are also some Vaishnava Hindus in Malaysia as well, many of them of North Indian extraction, and these Hindus worship in temples such as the Geeta Ashram in Seksyen 52, Petaling Jaya, or the Lakshmi-Narayana Temple in Kampung Kasipillay, Kuala Lumpur. Services in these temples are usually conducted in Hindi and English.\n\nFolk Hinduism is the most prevalent variety, including spiritualism and worship of village deities. \n\nThe International Society for Krishna Consciousness also has a number of followers in Malaysia, and maintains temples in Kuala Lumpur and also all over Malaysia. The Ratha-Yatra festival is held once a year in every temple throughout Malaysia approximately 10 to 12 Ratha Yatra which will be held usually end of the Year, when the Deities of Lord Jagannatha, Baladeva and Subhadra are placed on a chariot which is pulled through the streets by devotees, accompanied by a party chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. There also another group of Hare Krishna such as (followers of Ritvik, followers of Hansa Duta). There is also Gaudiya math and Saraswath Math.\n\nThere are also few devotees of Sri Vaishnavism of Ramanujacharya and the Madhvacharya Sampradaya.\n\nMalaysia also has large followers of several Vedantic traditions and groups such as Ramakrishna Mission. Ramakrishna Mission in Petaling Jaya has been in existence since the 1940s and was officially affiliated to the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, India in 2001. In 2015, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi visited the Ramakrishna Mission and unveiled a statue of Swami Vivekananda. Another important centre, closely connected with the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement is the Ramakrishna Ashramam, Penang which came into existence in 1938. The Vivekananda Ashrama, Kuala Lumpur is an institution started by the Jaffna (Sri Lankan) Tamil immigrants in 1904 in honour of Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902). The building, constructed in 1908, is dedicated to his work in providing education and spiritual development for the youth and community. The Vivekananda Ashram with a bronze statue of Swami Vivekananda has been declared as a heritage site in 2016.\n\nOther popular Vedanta-based organisations in Malaysia are Divine Life Society (also called Shivananda Ashram) with its headquarters at Batu Caves and Arsha Vijnana Gurukulam.\n\nSince the Second World War a revival of Hinduism has occurred among Indian Malaysians, with the foundation of organisations and councils to bring unity or to promote reform.\n\nSome of the major Hindu festivals celebrated every year include Deepavali (festival of lights), Thaipusam (Lord Murugan festival), Pongal (harvest festival) and Navaratri (Durga festival).\n\nDeepavali is the primary Hindu festival in Malaysia. The Malaysian Hindus traditionally hold open houses over Deepavali, where people of different ethnic groups and religions are welcomed in Hindu homes to share the festival of light as well as taste Indian food and sweets.\n\nDeepavali and Thaipusam are Public holidays in all states on Malaysia, except Sarawak.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, there were 1,777,694 people self-identifying as Hindus (6.27% of the population). Of the Hindus, 1,644,072 were Indian, 111,329 were non-citizens, 14,878 were Chinese, 4,474 Others, and 2,941 Tribals (Including 554 Iban in Sarawak). 86.18% of all the Indian Malaysians were Hindu. Information collected in the census based on the respondent's answer and did not refer to any official document.\n\nThere is a small historic Chitty community in Malacca, who are also known as the Indian Peranakans. They have adopted Chinese and Malay cultural practices whilst also retaining their Hindu heritage.\n\nThe Total fertility rate per religion is not published by the Malaysian government, only fertility rate by ethnicity is published. The fertility rate of Indians was 1.7 in 2010 which has fallen to 1.3 in 2016.\nThere are 5900 Balinese people in Malaysia, 90% of whom are Hindus. The 'Other Hindus' in the above Table might be representing them.\n\nPeople of Indian descent are derogatory called \"Keling\" in Malaysia. \n\nIslam is the official religion of Malaysia. The Constitution of Malaysia declares that Islam is the only religion of true Malay people and that natives are required to be Muslims. Conversion from Islam to Hinduism (or another religion) is against the law, but the conversion of Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians to Islam is welcomed. The government actively promotes the spread of Islam in the country. The law requires that any Hindu (or Buddhist or Christian) who marries a Muslim must first convert to Islam, otherwise the marriage is illegal and void. If one of the Hindu parents adopts Islam, the children automatically become Muslim without the consent of the second parent.\n\nThere are numerous cases in Malaysian courts relating to official persecution of Hindus. For example, in August 2010, a Malaysian woman named Siti Hasnah Banggarma was denied the right to convert to Hinduism by a Malaysian court; Banggarma, who was born a Hindu, but was forcibly converted to Islam at age 7, desired to reconvert back to Hinduism and appealed to the courts to recognise her reconversion. The appeal was denied. In 2016, an association of eight Hindu NGOs found that about 7,000 Hindus in Malaysia wrongly documented as Muslims. This problem was widespread throughout Peninsular Malaysia and involved mostly practising Hindus from the lower income group who are documented as Muslims.\n\nAfter a violent conflict in Penang between Hindus and Muslims in March 1998, the government announced a nationwide review of unlicensed Hindu temples and shrines. However, implementation was not vigorous and the program was not a subject of public debate.\n\nOn 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.\n\nThe president of the Consumers Association of Subang and Shah Alam in Selangor had been helping to organise efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of Shah Alam from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as Hinduism.\n\nOn 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from Kuala Lumpur forcefully demolished part of a 90-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 3,000 Hindus. The \"Hindu Rights Action Force\", a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the Malaysian Prime Minister.\n\nHINDRAF chairman, Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy, said:\nMany Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built \"illegally\". However, several of the temples are centuries old.\n\nAccording to a lawyer for the Hindu Rights Action Task Force, a Hindu temple is demolished in Malaysia once every three weeks.\n\nIn 2007, Malaysian Hindu organisations protested the destruction of Hindu temples by the Malaysian regime. On 30 October 2007, the 100-year-old Maha Mariamman Temple in Padang Jawa was demolished by Malaysian authorities. Following that demolition, Works Minister and head of the Malaysian Indian Congress Samy Vellu, who is of Indian origin, said that Hindu temples built on government land were still being demolished despite his appeals to the various state chief ministers.\n\nSuch temple destructions in Malaysia have been reported by the Hindu American Foundation.\n\nHAF notes that the Government of Malaysia Restricts Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association contrary to Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and Article 10 of the Malaysian Federal Constitution, and that the application filed by Malaysian Hindus to hold gatherings have been arbitrarily denied by the police. The Government has also tried to suppress a campaign launched by an NGO, the Hindu Rights Action Force (HINDRAF) to obtain 100,000 signatures in support of a civil suit against the Government of United Kingdom. HINDRAF has accused the Malaysian government of intimidating and instilling fear in the Indian community.\n\nThe Hindraf rally prompted the Malaysian government to open dialogue with various Indian and Hindu organizations like the Malaysia Hindu Council, Malaysia Hindudharma Mamandram, and Malaysian Indian Youth Council (MIYC) to address the misgivings of the Indian community. HINDRAF itself has been excluded from these talks and no significant changes have resulted from the discussions.\n\nThe Cow head protests was a protest that was held in front of the Selangor state government headquarters at the Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Building, Shah Alam, Malaysia on 28 August 2009. The protest was called so because the act of a few participants who brought along a cow head, which they later \"stomped on the head and spat on it before leaving the site\". The cow is considered a sacred animal to Hindus.\n\nThe protest was held due to Selangor state government's intention to relocate a Hindu temple from Section 19 residential area of Shah Alam to Section 23. The protesters were mainly Muslim extremists who opposed the relocation due to the fact that Section 23 was a Muslim majority area.\n\nThe protest leaders were also recorded saying there would be blood if a temple was constructed in Shah Alam. The protest was caught on video by the popular Malaysian online news portal \"Malaysiakini\".\n\nRevathi Massosai was born to Muslim converts and given a Muslim name, but she was raised as a Hindu by her grandmother and has always practised that faith. Revathi Massosai married a Hindu man in 2004 and the couple have a young daughter. But her marriage is not recognised by the Malaysian government because a Hindu man can't marry a Muslim girl as per the Sharia law. She was seized by the Islamic authorities when she went to court to ask that she be registered as a Hindu rather than a Muslim. She was incarcerated for six months in an Islamic re-education camp because of her attempts to renounce Islam in favour of the Hindu religion, where she was forced to eat beef (which is some Hindus refuse on religious grounds), forced to make her pray as a Muslim and to wear a headscarf. However, she is adamant that she will remain a Hindu. Islamic officials took the couple's 18-month-old daughter away from Suresh (her Hindu father) and gave her to Revathi's mother (her Muslim grandmother). Officials have ordered Revathi to live with her mother and continue with her Islamic 'counseling'.\n\nIn 2017, a teaching module published by a leading Malaysian university (Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) ) depicted Hindus in India as unclean and dirty in a slide. Another slide aimed at teaching the origins of Sikhism claimed that founder Guru Nanak had a poor understanding of Islam and had combined it with his surrounding Hindu lifestyle in forming the early foundation of the Sikh faith. A police report was lodged by the chairman of the Hindu Dharma Association of Malaysia in Sungai Petani district against UTM. Malaysia's Minister of Health, Deputy Minister of Education and others had condemned this incident. Due to these condemnations, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) was forced to apologize.\n\nIn 2008, The National Fatwa Council of Malaysia issued a fatwa against Yoga. Abdul Shukor Husim, the council's chairman, said: \"We are of the view that yoga, which originates in Hinduism, combines a physical exercise, religious elements, chanting and worshipping for the purpose of achieving inner peace and ultimately to be at one with God. For us, yoga destroys a Muslim's faith\". The fatwa says Muslims to avoid yoga because it uses Hindu prayers that could erode Muslims’ faith. Following this Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi moved to contain the damage, telling that Muslims could carry on doing yoga but avoiding the chanting. However, the fatwas by National Fatwa Council are not legally binding on the country's Muslims, unless they also become enshrined in national or sharia laws. But many Muslims abide by the edicts out of deference. But there are many Muslims too who go to yoga classes .\nIn 2009, Indira Gandhi's husband Pathmanathan converted to Islam and took up the name Muhammad Riduan Abdullah. Then he unilaterally converted his three children (one of whom was 11 months old) to Islam without the consent of his wife. The Sharia Court also granted custody of children to Riduan. This sparked a court battle for nine long years, as Indira, a Hindu, fought to gain custody of her three children — Prasana; Karan Dinish, 19; and Tevi Darsiny, 20 — and to quash their conversions.\n\nAt last, the Federal Court nullified their conversions and ruled that the consent of both parents was needed to convert a minor. The Federal Court on 2016 had ordered the Inspector-General of Police to execute a warrant of arrest for Riduan. Karan and Tevi have declared themselves Hindus. However, Riduan escaped taking Prasana along with him, both of them are still not found.\n\n\n\n"}

The Space Shuttle external tank and Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) would be combined with a cargo module that take the place of the Shuttle orbiter and include the main engines. Various Shuttle-C concepts were investigated between 1984 and 1995.\n\nThe Shuttle-C concept would theoretically cut development costs for a heavy launch vehicle by re-using technology developed for the shuttle program. End-of-life and space Shuttle hardware would also have been used. One proposal even involved converting the \"Columbia\" or \"Enterprise\" into a single-use cargo launcher. Before the loss of Space Shuttle \"Challenger\", NASA had expected about 14 shuttle flights a year. In the aftermath of the \"Challenger\" incident, it became clear that this launch rate was not feasible for a variety of reasons. With the Shuttle-C, it was thought that the lower maintenance and safety requirements for the uncrewed vehicle would allow a higher flight rate.\n\nThe Shuttle-C would have been the main crew launch vehicle for the Piloted ILREC Lander in the International Lunar Resources Exploration Program.\n\nIn the early 1990s, NASA engineers planning a crewed mission to Mars included a Shuttle-C design to launch six non reusable 80 ton segments to create two Mars ships in Earth orbit. After President George W. Bush called for the end of the Space Shuttle by 2010, these proposed configurations were put aside.\n\n\n"}

The play won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\n\nA workshop production at Seattle Repertory Theatre was held in April 1988, directed by Daniel J. Sullivan, starring Lizbeth MacKay, Caroline Aaron, and Gretchen Corbett.\n\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons on November 18, 1988 and closed on February 19, 1989 after 99 performances. It then transferred to Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre, opening on March 9, 1989 and closing on September 1, 1990, after 622 performances. Both productions were directed by Sullivan. The set design was by Thomas Lynch, costume design by Jennifer von Mayrhauser and lighting design by Pat Collins. The cast starred Joan Allen as Heidi, Boyd Gaines as Peter, and Peter Friedman as Scoop. Sarah Jessica Parker was featured in three small roles off-Broadway; those roles were played by Cynthia Nixon for the Broadway run.\n\nReplacement actors on Broadway included Christine Lahti, Brooke Adams, and Mary McDonnell as Heidi, David Hyde Pierce as Peter, and Tony Shalhoub as Scoop.\n\nTwo Broadway Heidis married the actor who played opposite them as Scoop: Joan Allen and Peter Friedman (now divorced) and Brooke Adams and Tony Shalhoub.\n\nThe first major production mounted after Wasserstein's death in January 2006 was at the Berkshire Theatre Festival in August and September 2006, featuring Kate Jennings Grant.\n\nOn September 30, 2011, produced by The English Theatre of Rome and directed by Gaby Ford, the play premiered in Italy, at Rome's Teatro dell'Arciliuto near Piazza Navona, to wide acclaim.\n\nA revival began Broadway previews on February 23, 2015, at the Music Box Theatre. The cast featured Elisabeth Moss in the title role, Bryce Pinkham as Peter Patrone and Jason Biggs as Scoop Rosenbaum, directed by Pam MacKinnon. The play opened officially on March 19. The production was originally scheduled to play through August 9, 2015 but closed on May 3 due to low ticket sales.\n\nThe plot follows Heidi Holland from high school in the 1960s to her career as a successful art historian more than twenty years later. The play's main themes deal with the changing role of women during this time period, describing both Heidi's ardent feminism during the 1970s and her eventual sense of betrayal during the 1980s. Though most of the characters are women, there are two important male characters; Peter Patrone, a gay pediatrician who is arguably Heidi's best friend, and Scoop Rosenbaum, a magazine editor who marries and has many affairs, and with whom Heidi has a tense friendship. Heidi meets Scoop at a Eugene McCarthy rally where he tries to woo her with knowledge and wit. She seems unenthused and lies about her name to Scoop but is soon convinced as she realizes Scoop is a very intelligent, attractive man despite his egotistical ways. The scene in which they first meet ends with a passionate kiss and night together. It is ambiguously implied that Heidi may have been a virgin at the time. Although they don't work out romantically, the chemistry between Scoop and Heidi is insatiable and they go on to be lifelong friends. Heidi realizes that not marrying does not mean she cannot be a mother and takes matters into her own hands. She chooses to adopt a child on her own.\n\n\"The New York Times\" critic Mel Gussow wrote of the Playwrights Horizon production: \"Ms. Wasserstein has always been a clever writer of comedy. This time she has been exceedingly watchful about not settling for easy laughter, and the result is a more penetrating play. This is not to suggest, however, that \"The Heidi Chronicles\" is ever lacking in humor.\"\n\nThe new Jerry Seinfeld sitcom pilot that premiered on NBC in July 1989 was entitled \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" as an homage to (or spoof of) Wasserstein's zeitgeist-dominating play. The show's title was quickly shortened to \"Seinfeld\".\n\nIn 1995, the play was adapted as a television film. It was directed by Paul Bogart and starred Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Hulce in the leading roles.\n\nSource:playbillvault.com\n\n"}

In return, Pound was more loyal, not to say faithful, to her than to any of his many other mistresses. He dedicated the final stanza of his epic \"The Cantos\" to her, in homage and gratitude for her courageous and loyal support of Pound during his 13-year incarceration in a mental hospital after having been indicted for treasonous activities against the United States and in support of Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. She also defended Pound against the accusation that he was anti-Semitic. During the last 11 years of Pound's life, Rudge was his devoted companion, secretary, and nurse, as he sank into eccentricity and prolonged silences.\n\nRudge survived Pound by twenty-four years, remaining in the small house in Venice she had shared with him. In her declining years, an ongoing difficult relationship with Mary, her only child, left her vulnerable to the attention of parties with ulterior motives, resulting in the sad situation described in John Berendt's \"The City of Falling Angels\", in which Rudge could not account for how Pound's papers and letters in her possession had found their way to Yale University. Failing health eventually forced her to leave her beloved Venice and spend her final days with her daughter. Rudge died a month before her 101st birthday and is buried next to Pound in Venice's Isola di San Michele cemetery.\n\nRudge was born to J. Edgar Rudge, a real estate investor, and Julia (née O'Connell) Rudge, a professional singer. Wanting to pursue a singing career, Julia moved to Europe with her three children when Olga was 10, living first in London then in Paris. Olga was educated at a convent school in Sherborne, Dorset, England, before studying in Paris under the violinist Léon Carambât of the \"Opéra-Comique\".\n\nBy 1916, Rudge was a renowned concert violinist, performing in many concerts to raise money for the British and French side of the First World War. Her brother Arthur was killed in action in 1918. At the end of the war in 1918, she began her career as an international concert violinist, under the auspices of Ildebrando Pizzetti and his patroness Katherine Dalliba-John. In 1918, Pizzetti and Rudge did a joint concert tour of Italy, performing modern Italian music.\n\nRudge first met the poet Ezra Pound when he reviewed a concert Rudge gave at the Aeolian Hall in November 1920, admiring the \"delicate firmness of her fiddling\" yet criticising the \"piano whack\" of her accompanist Renata Borgatti. Rudge continued her association with Borgatti and pursuing her interest in modern Italian music, giving concerts with Borgatti and Pizzetti at the Sala Bach in Rome in 1921, and joining Renata Borgatti again at the Salle Pleyel in 1922.\n\nOne of her first meetings with Pound took place in 1923, in Paris at the salon of Natalie Barney. Pound later recalled \"her delicate and unemphatic reserve\". At this time Pound was developing his own musical interests, composing an opera and advancing the work of American composer George Antheil. Antheil and Rudge were to enjoy a long professional collaboration dating from this period, which also marked the beginning of her sexual relationship with Pound. Rudge was now an established and successful soloist living in a luxurious apartment on Paris's ultrarespectable \"right bank\". She had nothing to gain by an association with a bohemian eccentric poet such as Pound, who was definitely \"left bank\" in his views and works. This willingness to flout convention and put her reputation at risk would typify her long affair with Pound.\n\nIn December 1923, Rudge and Antheil gave a concert at the Salle du Conservatoire which included not only works by Mozart, Bach, and Antheil, but also Ezra Pound's \"Sujet pour violin\". For his work to be performed by a notable soloist was exactly the publicity Pound the aspiring composer desired. In 1924, Rudge and Antheil performed \"Musique Americaine\" at the Salle Pleyel. This concert also included work by Pound and Antheil's \"Deuxieme Sonate\", dedicated to Rudge. From 1923 onwards, Pound's letters to Rudge advise her on her career. He strongly recommended her to pay more attention to her patrons (something he himself never failed to do), and chided her for her lack of interest in the press comments concerning her concerts.\n\nBy 1924, Pound and his wife, the former Dorothy Shakespear, had moved from Paris to Rapallo, Italy. Rudge, now in the full throes of her enduring love affair with Pound, visited him several times. From this time Pound seems to have divided his time equally between Rudge and his wife, a situation which was to continue until the Second World War. In the Spring of 1925, Rudge was forced to pull out of a planned concert tour of the United States as she was pregnant by Pound. On July 9, 1925, she gave birth to her daughter Mary at the local hospital in the city of Brixen in the province of South Tyrol. Keen to avoid the stigma an illegitimate child would have on her career, Rudge paid to have Mary looked after by a peasant family in the South Tyrolian village of Gais—a German-speaking village part of Italy.\n\nShe remained unconcerned about the possible stigma of being the mistress of a married man, and her association with Pound continued unabated. She resumed her career with a concert at the Salle Pleyel in 1926, where she played in the premiere of Pound's new opera, \"Le Testament de Villon\". Her association with Antheil continued with concerts in the capital cities of Europe, and at this time she began to specialise in the works of Mozart. She was now one of the most celebrated solo violinists of the era, playing before the Heads of State and political leaders of Europe.\n\nIn 1928, Rudge's father bought her a small house in Venice, situated in the Calle Querini. Named \"The Hidden Nest\", it was to be her Venetian home for the remainder of her life. There, she began to develop her maternal instincts, bringing her daughter Mary for occasional visits. It was the beginning of a difficult and complex relationship between mother and daughter. Mary's existence was a closely guarded secret: Pound did not disclose it even to his own father until 1930. Pound often stayed with Rudge when their daughter visited Venice. However, the couple were often keen to be alone together, and so Rudge rented a Rapallo house near that of Pound and his wife, where the couple were able to conduct their affair unhindered by wife and children (Pound had a stepson, Omar, who was Dorothy's son by an unknown father, thought to be an Egyptian).\n\nThe 1930s were the years of a global depression affecting all industries including the music industry. Most patrons and customers of concerts, venues, and performers were now often in financial difficulties themselves. To make ends meet, Rudge worked in 1933 as a secretary to Accademia Musicale in Siena. She also managed to continue her musical career, performing in the annual Concerti Tigulliani program organized by Pound at Rapallo. Around this time, Rudge and Pound became key figures in the Antonio Vivaldi revival. The 1936 Concerti Tigulliani program was devoted to Vivaldi, especially his lesser known works. To prepare for these concerts, Rudge studied many of Vivialdi's original scores kept in Turin. She attempted to organize a Vivaldi Society in Venice, without success. In 1938, she founded the \"Centro di Studi Vivaldiani\" at the \"Accademia Chigiana\", devoted to Vivaldi's work.\n\nRudge and Pound were both keen readers of mystery and detective novels: this was the era of Agatha Christie, whose books earned her a fortune. Seeking to do the same, Pound and Rudge began in the 1930s, but never completed, a detective novel of their own; titled \"The Blue Spill\", it centred on the escapades of a Surrey detective. As World War II approached, Rudge limited her travel outside of Italy, last playing in London in 1935. By this time, Pound was vehemently pro-Mussolini and had begun broadcasting his views on Radio Rome, with Rudge's support. In 1941, they thought of returning to the U.S.A. for the duration of the war. Pound eventually decided against doing so, and they remained in Italy throughout the war. Pound's failure, at a crucial juncture, to declare his loyalty to his native country when it was at war, haunted him from the end of the war until the end of his life. As for Rudge, she had to live with the suspicion that she was the lover of a traitor to her country.\n\nThe war years were difficult for the couple. After the United States entered the war, Pound and his wife Dorothy became enemy aliens in Italy, an ironic situation in light of Pound's support of Mussolini. Their home in Rapallo was sequestered in 1943 and the couple had little choice but to move in with Rudge. Thus the ménage à trois for so long a matter of public speculation became a reality. Rudge sent her daughter back to Gais to live with her original peasant guardians, and was forced by necessity to support the Pounds and her daughter by giving language lessons. It was a very difficult time for the trio: while both women adored Pound, they hated each other. Pound's wife later wrote that \"hatred and tension permeated the house\".\n\nFollowing the United States' invasion of Italy in 1945, Pound was arrested as a traitor and was held in an open cage in Pisa for 25 days. His support for the Fascists and broadcasts for Rome radio led to an indictment for treason. Rudge too had been arrested. She was released after interrogation, but she was not permitted to correspond with her lover until several months later. She and Pound's wife are known to have once visited him during his detention.\n\nAlthough she was deprived of her lover, the end of the war saw an improvement in Rudge's fortunes as her sequestered Venetian home was returned to her. In order to avoid a trial for treason, Pound was declared criminally insane and incarcerated in an asylum, St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he remained for twelve years. Rudge began the onerous task of trying to secure his freedom. She used friends and their many contacts in the literary world to mount a petition attesting to his character and that amongst other things he had never in fact been a member of the Italian Fascist Party (\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\"). One of her ideas was that Pound be released to live in an American monastery, but all her entreaties fell on deaf ears. His letters discourage Rudge from visiting him but she did travel to America to visit him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955. Pound at this time was receiving visits not only from his wife but other mistresses too. Following the 1955 visit, their letters to each other became cooler and more impersonal, and they rarely communicated at all from 1955 to 1959.\n\nThis coolness between 1955 and 1959 is the only hint that perhaps she did mind his other lady friends, but little is known of Rudge's views of Pound's \"other women\". She had no choice but to tolerate the existence of his wife. Marcella Spann, an English teacher, began to write to him in St. Elizabeth's, which led to visits. Following his release, Spann accompanied Ezra and Dorothy back to Italy, acting as his secretary. Pound is alleged to have proposed to her (although he was already married), but Dorothy sent Spann packing. Nevertheless, Spann and Pound jointly edited the 1964 volume \"Confucius to Cummings: An Anthology of Poetry\".\n\nIn 1958, Pound was declared incapable of standing trial. He was stripped of his rights of citizenship and released from St. Elizabeth's on condition that he return to Europe. With his wife, who was also his legal custodian, he quickly returned to Italy. The couple stayed with Rudge's daughter by Pound, Mary, now married to Boris de Rachewiltz and living at Brunnenberg castle in Tirol. Pound's health was now broken and he spent a year in the sanatorium Martinsbrunn in Meran. It is thought that during his time in St. Elizabeth's Pound was treated with mind altering drugs that altered his personality permanently for the worse. In early 1962, \"depressed and ill, Pound chose to put himself in Olga's hands\". For the remainder of his life he lived with her, part of each year in Venice, part in Rapallo.\n\nThe last eleven years of Pound's life accentuated his eccentricities, including a self-imposed vow of near-silence, with which Rudge coped while completely arranging his life and acting as his secretary. Many scholars and students sought Pound out and would arrive at the small house. Rudge devised a test to distinguish the genuine from the merely curious. She would ask the prospective visitor to recite a line from one of Pound's works; those who could gained admittance, those who could not were shown out. For Rudge, life with Pound was not easy; yet, her belief in him was absolute.\n\nFor the first time, Rudge now had Pound completely to herself, as his wife Dorothy withdrew from the triangle. Pound saw Dorothy only twice during his last four years. The couple seldom left their Venice or Rapallo homes; however, they journeyed to London in 1965 for the funeral of T.S. Eliot and to the United States in 1969. Pound, hospitalized immediately following his eighty-seventh birthday celebration, died November 1, 1972 holding Rudge's hand. She organized his funeral in the cemetery on the Isola di San Michele, Venice. After his death Rudge acquired a large archive of his papers and artifacts. Dorothy Pound died the following year, leaving Rudge the last member of the \"ménage à trois\" to carry Pound's torch.\n\nRudge was 78 years old when Pound died, the beginning of the final phase of her life. She became one of Venice's resident celebrities, quick witted, intelligent, and cultured. She sat on many committees organizing the city's many charities and galas. She was an essential guest at the city's profuse \"dolce vita\" gatherings, but continued to inhabit the same small house she had shared with Pound. Encouraging young aspiring poets and artists, she often offered them free use of the top floor of her home in return for a small painting or dedicated poem. Frequently asked to write an autobiography, she always replied \"Write about Pound.\" She saw it as her \"raison d'être\" to promote Pound's work and defend his reputation against charges of anti-Semitism and Fascism.\n\nRudge's relationship with her daughter Mary had always been complex: at the time of the birth, Rudge had in fact wanted a son. Having boarded the child with Tyrolean farmers at birth, Rudge was later surprised to find the child developed into \"a dialect speaking farm girl\". Rudge tried to rectify this situation upon being permanently reunited with Mary when the child was ten. Elocution, etiquette, and music lessons were met with fierce opposition; a violin that Rudge gave to her daughter was smashed against a chicken coop: in short, Mary found her mother distant, impenetrable, and authoritarian. Her relationship with her father was better. She learned of her illegitimacy only in her late teens. Pound asked Mary to translate his epic work \"The Cantos\" into Italian. This was to be the beginning of a lifelong passion and study of Pound's work, with Mary later referring to \"The Cantos\" as \"my bible\". \n\nMary wrote her autobiography \"Discretions\" in 1971 (the title being a play on words on Pound's autobiography \"Indiscretions\"). The revelations contained in the book \"deeply hurt\" Rudge, and she and her daughter did not communicate for several years, although she remained in regular contact with Mary's children, Walter de Rachewiltz and Patrizia de Rachewiltz de Vroom. Mother and daughter later overcame their estrangement. Rudge had to become dependent on friends and acquaintances for the necessities of life. In later life, her memory began to fail her.\n\nIt had always been Rudge's intention to set up a foundation of some kind to house Pound's archives, but this was a task she always deferred, while continuing to assist scholars of his work and organize several exhibitions devoted to him. In 1986, Rudge together with an American friend, Jane Rylands, and an attorney from Cleveland, Ohio, formed the \"Ezra Pound Foundation\". She sold most of her archive and her house to the Foundation for a sum of approximately seven thousand dollars. After the establishment of the Foundation, Rudge's family alleged that this had not been her intention, and that the house and archive were worth considerably more. Part of the problem was that, aged 91, Rudge was becoming forgetful of things she had agreed to.\n\nIn April 1988, she wrote to the Cleveland attorney informing him of her wish to dissolve the Foundation. The reply told her that such a request was not within the law. The papers were later deposited in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, where they are housed today, and the Ezra Pound Foundation was dissolved. One box of papers concerning the transfer of the archive from the Ezra Pound Foundation is withheld from public viewing.\n\nAt the time of the creation of the Ezra Pound Foundation, Rudge's friends were becoming increasingly concerned for her. Sculptress Joan Fitzgerald contacted Rudge's daughter, and Rudge's son-in-law and grandson immediately came to Venice. They found that ownership of her house \"The Hidden Nest\" had not yet been conveyed to the Foundation and were able to recover it, but the archive, containing letters not only from Pound but from other great literary figures of the day, had passed from her ownership. Rudge continued for a short while to live at \"The Hidden Nest\" until old age and infirmity forced to her to leave Venice and make her final home with her daughter at Schloss Brunnenburg. Her family – her daughter, two grandchildren and four great-grandsons – were protective of her, and it was at their home that Rudge died, aged 100, on 15 March 1996.\n\nShe was buried with Pound in Venice. Joan Fitzgerald, a close friend of the couple, engraved on their simple tombstones the verse \"O God, what great kindness have we done in times past and forgotten it, That thou givest this wonder unto us, O God of waters?\" (Night Litany). An alternative epitaph to Rudge could have been that written by Pound in 1966 and intended to be placed at the end of the final Canto:\n\nRudge was fiercely proud to have always been financially independent of Pound, and continued her career as concert violinist until the Second World War. Her advocacy of the works of Vivaldi, which included publishing a catalogue of his works and an article in the \"Grove Dictionary of Music\", did much to establish his modern day popularity. She discovered and publicised 309 Vivaldi concertos which had either been lost or forgotten. However, it is as Pound's muse, mistress, and champion that she is chiefly remembered today. Anne Conover's book \"Olga Rudge and Ezra Pound\" (2001) is one of the few to credit Rudge for her own endeavours as well as her role of muse to Ezra Pound. Shortly before his death, Pound wrote of Rudge: There is more courage in Olga's little finger than in the whole of my carcass ... she kept me alive for ten years, for which no one will thank her. The true story will not be told until her version is known.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838054", "title": "IMP Society", "text": "IMP Society\n\nThe IMP Society is a secret society at the University of Virginia that is notable for combining philanthropy and public mischief.\n\nIt was founded in 1902 as a society called the Hot Feet. The society was known primarily for its public ceremonies in which it crowned the society's \"king\". The Hot Feet were disbanded in 1908 under pressure from the university's Administrative Council, who called the society \"very detrimental to the University's welfare\" and banned it, along with \"all other organizations which promote disorder in the \nUniversity.\" While the society returned, it was to be disbanded once more; university historian Virginius Dabney records the final activity of the society as the 1911 distribution of stuffed animal specimens from the natural history museum about Grounds on Easter Sunday, and the assault of a student in his room.\n\nThe society reconstituted itself in 1913 as the IMP Society, and remains active.\n\nThe IMP Society has engaged in philanthropic activities around the University, presenting the IMP Award, given \"to a faculty member who had been outstanding in promoting student-faculty relations and perpetuating the traditions of the university\", and the IMP Student Athlete Award, given at graduation to a female athlete who has excelled in both the field and the classroom; and a recent student social justice-oriented community service fellowship.\n\nIn addition to philanthropy, IMPs are known to march around the grounds carrying pitchforks, wearing horned hoods, and engaging in mild mischief and revelry. (In one 2004 incident, the group was forced to apologize after using gasoline to start a bonfire on the Lawn during a nighttime ceremony.) The society publicly \"taps\" its new members, and most current members wear a ring indicating their membership in the organization. While the members of the group are known, many of their community service works are not widely publicized. Like the Seven Society and Z Society, the IMP Society is known to paint their symbol around university grounds.\n\nMembers of the IMP Society are more public than other societies at the university, often recognized by their ring with the face of a devil on it, or their public tappings. Notable IMP and Hot Feet alumni include James Rogers McConnell, who was the inspiration for Gutzon Borglum's statue \"The Aviator\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1838071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838071", "title": "KDAF", "text": "KDAF\n\nKDAF, virtual channel 33 (UHF digital channel 32), is a CW-affiliated television station licensed to Dallas, Texas, United States and serving the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex. It serves as the flagship station of Irving-based Nexstar Media Group. KDAF's studios are located off the John W. Carpenter Freeway (State Highway 183) in northwest Dallas, and its transmitter is located south of Belt Line Road in Cedar Hill.\n\nChannel 33 was allocated to Dallas in 1966 as part of a settlement between two applicants that had been competing for channel 29: Maxwell Electronics Corporation and Overmyer Communications. In order to give each applicant a channel, Overmyer suggested moving channel 27 from Tyler to Dallas and substituting 33 for 29, with Overmyer taking 27 and Maxwell taking 33. While the Overmyer application ultimately was dropped, Maxwell's channel 33 went ahead, launching as independent station KMEC-TV on October 1, 1967. It was one of three new UHF independent stations in the Metroplex in six months (KFWT-TV channel 21 had signed on September 19 and KDTV channel 39 would debut in February 1968), and it was the first to fold. On October 25, 1968, Maxwell announced it was taking KMEC-TV dark and selling the station to Evans Broadcasting Company.\n\nEvans did not restore KMEC-TV to operational status. Instead, it sold the construction permit in 1971 to Berean Fellowship International, which returned channel 33 to air as KBFI-TV on February 21, 1972. Berean, a locally based Christian ministry, operated the station as a family-oriented, general-entertainment independent with weekend religious programming. KBFI-TV lasted 10 months, closing on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe Portsmouth, Virginia-based Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) purchased the license and returned channel 33 to the air on April 16, 1973 as KXTX-TV. It was CBN's third operating television station, after WYAH-TV in Portsmouth, and WANX-TV in Atlanta. As did CBN's other independent stations (and KBFI-TV), it maintained a general entertainment and religious format. However, just two months later, Doubleday Broadcasting, the owner of KDTV which had sought to sell or donate the facility to a nonprofit organization, opted to donate the channel 39 license to CBN, which paid for $1.2 million in program contracts that had dampened interest in Doubleday's offer from educational groups. On November 14, 1973, KXTX-TV's programming and staff moved to channel 39, using the KDTV license and studio facilities. (The KDTV call letters were then reused by a station in San Francisco.)\n\nIn 1974, the National Business Network applied to the FCC for a new construction permit to launch a new station on that allocation, which was issued on June 13, 1977. NBN was a locally based group operated by Nolanda Hill and Sheldon Turner (both of whom, who had previously successfully lobbied the Dallas City Council to have a cable television franchise established in the city, each owned a 40% interest); other investors included, among others, radio broadcaster Gordon McLendon, who had made previous failed attempts to launch a UHF television station in the market and served as a commentator on precious metals once it launched.\n\nThe current television station that would become KDAF first signed on the air on September 29, 1980 as KNBN-TV. It operated from studio facilities located in a converted warehouse on 3333 Harry Hines Boulevard near downtown Dallas (the building has since been torn down). The initial programming format consisted of business news programming during the daytime hours; evenings, meanwhile, were occupied by the subscription television service VEU (owned by Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasters), featuring a mix of feature films, specials and, during the NBA season, Dallas Mavericks game telecasts.\n\nThe original mix changed within a year when the station added programming from the Spanish International Network in the early evening hours. In March 1982, the remaining business programming disappeared after Turner was not able to build a national syndication base for NBN's output, and KNBN-TV began devoting its entire conventional broadcast day to Spanish programming from SIN. When VEU bought the subscriber base of rival service Preview, the service transitioned from channel 33 to KTWS-TV channel 27 beginning in December; the decision was taken because the contract with KTWS-TV offered more flexibility for expansion than that with KNBN-TV.\n\nIn the fall of 1983, Hill Broadcasting sold KNBN to New York City-based Metromedia, which already owned independent stations in five of the six major U.S. cities where it owned television stations, for $15 million; the sale was finalized on November 8 of that year. Initially, KNBN remained a Spanish language station; however, it had drafted plans to eventually switch to an English language format. Around the time of its acquisition, the station added a couple of English language syndicated programs that were distributed by its new corporate parent's Metromedia Pictures Corporation subsidiary that were not already carried by any other station in Dallas-Fort Worth. SIN programming would eventually be relegated to the late afternoon and nighttime periods, with some English-language programming being added during the daytime hours.\n\nOn July 30, 1984, the station's call letters were changed to KRLD-TV to match radio station KRLD (1080 AM), which became a sister property to the television station after Metromedia successfully sought the FCC for a waiver of its cross-ownership regulations to let it retain KRLD radio and the UHF station. (This made channel 33 the second KRLD-TV in Dallas; the call letters had been used on channel 4 when it was co-owned with KRLD until 1970.) Its operations subsequently moved to studio facilities located next door to KRLD radio at the station's current facility on John W. Carpenter Freeway on the northwest side of Dallas. The new KRLD-TV was entering a very crowded marketplace, one of the justifications made by Metromedia in securing the waiver: its competition included KTXA, KXTX-TV and KTVT, the latter of which was the leading independent in the market at the time.\n\nThe station adopted a general entertainment format, initially programming a schedule made primarily of adult-targeted fare such as first-run syndicated programs, plenty of off-network dramas, reruns of older game shows and some low-budget movies; the programming inventory incorporated very few cartoons at first, as most of these programs and shorts were already carried by other area stations. From 1984 to 1987, Channel 33 served as the broadcast home of the Dallas Sidekicks indoor soccer club. In the fall of 1985, with a huge abundance of barter cartoons now available on the market, KRLD-TV added two-hour blocks of these programs in the 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. timeslots, and also began phasing in more off-network sitcoms into its lineup.\n\nUnder Metromedia's stewardship, its format began to increasingly resemble a traditional independent station for that time. Even still, channel 33 continued to underperform as most of the stronger programs available on the syndication market had been acquired by either its rival independents or by the market's network affiliates; the station also struggled to define a clear programming identity as it heavily incorporated movies, reruns and children's programs, while the shows it did air were repeatedly moved to different time slots in hopes of shoring up their ratings. The station attempted a coup to improve viewership by acquiring the local rights to syndicated reruns of \"Dallas\" and \"Dynasty\" for a reported fee of up to $38,000 per episode, only for neither show to pull decent ratings locally when they joined the station in September 1985.\n\nIn May 1985, Metromedia reached an agreement to sell KRLD-TV and its five sister independent stations–WNEW-TV (now WNYW) in New York City, KTTV in Los Angeles, WFLD-TV in Chicago, WTTG in Washington, D.C. and KRIV in Houston – to News Corporation for $2.55 billion. Metromedia sold its radio stations, including KRLD, to Carl Brazell in a $285 million transaction completed in early 1986.\nThat October, News Corporation – which had purchased a 50% interest in 20th Century Fox corporate parent TCF Holdings for $250 million in March 1985 – announced its intentions to create a fourth television network that would use the resources of 20th Century Fox Television to both produce and distribute programming, intending for it to compete with ABC, CBS and NBC. The company formally announced the launch of the new network, the Fox Broadcasting Company, on May 7, 1986, with the former Metromedia stations serving as its nuclei. The purchase of the Metromedia stations was approved by the FCC and finalized on March 6, 1986, with News Corporation creating a new broadcasting unit, the Fox Television Stations, to oversee the six television stations. Concurrent with the completion of the Metromedia stations' acquisition by News Corporation, the station's call letters were changed to KDAF (representing the two cities it served, Dallas and Fort Worth,\" but would later take on an unofficial secondary meaning as \"Dallas Area Fox\").\n\nKDAF became one of the charter owned-and-operated stations of the Fox Broadcasting Company at the network's launch seven months later on October 6, making it the first network-owned television station (commercial or non-commercial) in the Metroplex. Although it was now part of a network, channel 33, for all intents and purposes, continued to be programmed as a \"de facto\" independent station as Fox's initial programming consisted solely of a late-night talk show, \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\"; even when Fox launched its prime time lineup in April 1987, the network only aired programs during that daypart on weekends for two years afterward, before gradually adding additional nights of programming until it adopted a seven-night-a-week schedule in September 1993. Until Fox began airing prime time programming on a daily basis, KDAF aired a movie at 7:00 p.m. on nights when network programs did not air. The station, which began identifying as \"Fox 33,\" remained unprofitable well into the early 1990s. However, with Fox's growth in the early part of that decade, the station was turning modest profits by 1994.\n\nOn December 18, 1993, the National Football League (NFL) accepted a $1.58 billion bid by Fox to acquire the television rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) for an initial four-year contractual tenure, beginning with the 1994 NFL season. The deal resulted in Fox assuming the NFC rights from CBS, which had carried the conference's games since 1956, fourteen years before the NFL merged with the American Football League (with their respective teams being split into the NFC and the American Football Conference). In order to raise the network's profile in advance of the start of the contract, Fox strategized to strengthen its affiliate portfolio by recruiting more VHF stations, especially those located in markets with an NFC franchise; at the time, Fox's stations were mostly UHF outlets that had limited to no prior history as major network affiliates, although it owned VHF outlets in four markets (WNYW, KTTV, WTTG and KSTU in Salt Lake City).\n\nOn May 23, 1994, News Corporation – as part of a deal that included its acquisition of a 20% equity interest in the latter company – signed a long-term affiliation agreement with New World Communications, in which Fox would affiliate with heritage \"Big Three\" network stations that New World either owned outright or were in the process of purchasing in twelve markets. Under the initial agreement, nine television stations affiliated with either CBS, ABC or NBC – five out of seven that New World acquired through its 1992 purchase of SCI Television, and four others that it acquired on May 5 from Great American Communications (in a separate deal for $350 million in cash and $10 million in share warrants) – would become Fox affiliates once their existing respective affiliation contracts expired.\n\nSubsequently, on May 26, New World bought four stations owned by Argyle Television Holdings for $717 million, in a purchase option-structured deal. Under the terms, New World included CBS affiliate KDFW-TV – along with two of its sister stations, fellow CBS affiliate KTBC in Austin and ABC affiliate KTVI in St. Louis – in the group's affiliation agreement with Fox (NBC affiliate WVTM-TV in Birmingham was exempted as New World chose to transfer that market's ABC affiliate WBRC as well as ABC affiliate WGHP in High Point, North Carolina into a trust company for later sale to Fox Television Stations to comply with FCC restrictions at the time that prohibited broadcasting companies from owning more than twelve television stations nationwide and, in the case of Birmingham, barred television station duopolies). Although the network already owned KDAF, Fox sought the opportunity to affiliate with a VHF station in what was then the nation's seventh-largest market as KDFW had much stronger ratings than Channel 33 (placing second, behind ABC affiliate WFAA (channel 8), in total day and news viewership at the time) and maintained a news department; as a result, Fox Television Stations announced that it would place KDAF up for sale in early June 1994 (the agreement with New World resulted in Fox also placing Atlanta sister station WATL (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) up for sale, in order for the network to affiliate with CBS affiliate WAGA-TV, with the former of the two Atlanta stations being sold to Qwest Broadcasting).\n\nCBS, meanwhile, had a thirteen-month leeway to find a new Dallas–Fort Worth affiliate, as its contract with KDFW did not expire until July 1, 1995. In the interim, for the first year of the network's contract with the NFC, KDAF assumed the local broadcast rights to the Dallas Cowboys – which previously had most of their games that were carried on broadcast television air on KDFW starting in 1962 through the NFC's contract with CBS, with the telecasts often drawing high ratings for that station – as a lame-duck O&O, when Fox formally began airing NFL telecasts on September 12, 1994 (Fox had aired its first NFL preseason game telecasts the month before). After approaching longtime NBC affiliate KXAS-TV (channel 5) and later being turned down for an affiliation deal by its then-owner LIN Broadcasting, on September 14, 1994, Gaylord Broadcasting reached an agreement to affiliate KTVT (channel 11) with CBS, in exchange for also switching its sister independent station in Tacoma, Washington, KSTW (now a CW owned-and-operated station), to the network.\n\nOn November 15, 1994, Fox Television Stations announced that it would sell KDAF to Greenwich, Connecticut-based Renaissance Communications for $100 million; in exchange, Renaissance would sell existing Fox affiliate KDVR in Denver and its Fort Collins satellite station KFCT to Fox Television Stations for $70 million. Under the terms of the deal, Renaissance also reached an agreement with Time Warner in which KDAF would become an affiliate of The WB once the Fox affiliation moved to KDFW. Initially, KTVT was to become the network's Dallas-Fort Worth charter affiliate; however, Gaylord's pact to affiliate CBS with its stations in Dallas and Seattle effectively nullified that agreement, resulting in Time Warner filing an injunction in an attempt to dissolve The WB's affiliation agreement for those two stations and KHTV (now CW affiliate KIAH, a present-day sister station to KDAF) in Houston, the latter of which would ultimately join the network at its launch. Since KDAF could not join the network until KDFW's contract with CBS expired and Fox moved its programming to that station, The WB entered into a temporary affiliation arrangement with KXTX-TV, in which it would serve as the network's Metroplex charter affiliate in the interim.\n\nHowever the \"de facto\" trade hit a roadblock that nearly prevented the exchange from taking place: on January 15, 1995, NBC filed a petition to the FCC that called on the agency to reject approval of the KDVR purchase, alleging that News Corporation was in violation of FCC rules prohibiting foreign companies from holding more than a 25% ownership interest in an American television station (News Corporation founder and then-CEO Rupert Murdoch was born in Australia, where the company was founded before moving its operations to New York City in 1988, but became an American citizen in early 1986). Fox structured the KDVR-for-KDAF deal as two separate sales rather than as a trade with a cash exchange in likely anticipation of NBC trying to appeal the transaction and to ensure that Renaissance would continue on with its purchase of KDAF in either event. NBC withdrew the petition – as well as others it filed regarding Fox's concurring purchases of WFXT in Boston and WTXF-TV in Philadelphia, and News Corporation's ownership interest in SF Broadcasting – on February 17, 1995. New World, meanwhile, took over the operations of KDFW and the other Argyle Television stations through time brokerage agreements on January 19, 1995, three months before the group's purchase of the four stations was finalized on April 14.\n\nFox's prime time and sports programming moved from KDAF to KDFW on July 2, 1995, with the CBS affiliation concurrently moving to KTVT. Although it lost the rights to most of Fox's programming, KDAF retained the local broadcast rights to the network's children's programming block, Fox Kids, as KDFW station management declined to carry the block's weekday daytime and Saturday morning editions (a move which had become standard practice for the other New World stations that had joined Fox since September 1994). KDAF took over the WB affiliation three days later on July 5, at which time, the station changed its branding to \"WB 33\"; KXTX simultaneously reverted into an independent station. The sales of KDAF to Renaissance Broadcasting and KDVR to Fox were finalized on July 9.\n\nAs it did for most of its tenure as a Fox O&O, KDAF once again filled the 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. time slot with feature films as The WB had only maintained a lineup of prime time programs on Wednesday nights when the network moved over to Channel 33; this would become less of an issue as The WB launched additional nights of programming over the next four years, adopting a six-night weekly schedule in September 1999 (running Sunday through Fridays). In addition, the station's inventory of children's programming expanded when The WB launched a competitor to Fox Kids, Kids' WB, in September 1995; the station carried Kids' WB's weekday morning and afternoon blocks together on Monday through Friday mornings, while the Saturday morning block aired on Sundays as it aired the Fox Kids weekend block in its standard Saturday time slot. Alongside WB prime time programming and a blend of cartoons from both Fox Kids and Kids' WB, KDAF initially carried some syndicated cartoons, older and recent off-network sitcoms, and some first-run syndicated shows, including some series that KTVT was forced to vacate from its schedule to make room for the heavy amount of network programming brought on by its new CBS affiliation.\n\nOn July 1, 1996, Chicago-based Tribune Broadcasting announced that it would acquire Renaissance Communications for $1.13 billion. At the time, Tribune held a partial ownership interest in The WB; however KDAF could not technically be considered an owned-and-operated station of the network since Time Warner held an 87.5% majority stake in the network – which eventually decreased to 78%, when Tribune increased its stake in the network by purchasing a portion of Time Warner's equity interest. Two weeks later on July 17, News Corporation – which separated most of its entertainment holdings into 21st Century Fox in July 2013 – announced that it would acquire New World in an all-stock transaction worth $2.48 billion; the purchase by News Corporation was finalized on January 22, 1997, folding New World's ten Fox affiliates into the Fox Television Stations subsidiary, making KDFW the second television station in the Dallas-Fort Worth market to have served as a Fox owned-and-operated station.\n\nKDAF's programming focus gradually shifted under Tribune ownership; the station reduced its children's programming inventory to that provided by Kids' WB and acquired via syndication in September 1997, when the local rights to the Fox Kids block moved to independent station KDFI, which at the time was operated alongside KDFW through a local marketing agreement. KDAF gradually evolved its programming slate from the mid-1990s to about 2002, shifting focus away from older programs towards a lineup consisting primarily of first-run talk shows, reality series and court shows during the daytime hours, and recent off-network comedy and drama series at night. By September 2002, the only animated programs that were carried on KDAF came from Kids' WB; it became the last station in the market that continued to run cartoons on weekday afternoons until the weekday edition of the block was discontinued by The WB in January 2006, when the network replaced it with the Daytime WB rerun block (which would evolve into The CW Daytime). In January 2005, the station changed its on-air branding to \"Dallas-Fort Worth's WB,\" de-emphasizing the station's Channel 33 allocation; it reverted to the \"WB 33\" brand and the previous accompanying logo (which it adopted upon the July 1995 switch to the network) by January 2006.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, Time Warner's Warner Bros. unit and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN. In their place, the companies would combine the respective programming of the two networks to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW. On that date, The CW also signed a ten-year affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting, under which sixteen of the group's eighteen WB-affiliated stations would serve as the network's charter stations.\n\nOne of the stations included in the agreement was KDAF, which was announced as the network's Dallas-Fort Worth affiliate over UPN affiliate KTXA, one of five stations owned by CBS Television Stations that was excluded from a separate affiliation deal between that group and The CW in markets where Tribune owned a WB affiliate and CBS owned either a UPN affiliate or independent station; although since the network chose its affiliates based on which television station among The WB and UPN's respective affiliate bodies was the highest-rated in each market, it is likely that KDAF would have been chosen over KTXA in any event, as it had been the higher-rated of the two stations dating back to its tenure as a Fox owned-and-operated station. In preparation for the launch, the station unveiled its new on-air branding as \"CW 33\" in July 2006, primarily for promotions for The CW's programming and other related station imaging. KDAF officially joined The CW upon that network's launch on September 18 of that year, at which point, the new brand was applied to full-time usage.\n\nOn April 2, 2007, Chicago-based investor Sam Zell announced plans to purchase the Tribune Company, with intentions to take the publicly traded firm private; the deal was completed on December 20, 2007. Tribune subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2008, due to the $12 billion in debt accrued from Zell's leveraged buyout and costs from the privatization of the company; Tribune emerged from bankruptcy in December 2012 under the control of its senior debt holders Oaktree Capital Management, Angelo, Gordon & Co. and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBecause of the consistent relative weakness in the ratings for The CW's programs, both locally and nationally (the national average total viewership of the network's programs ranges from just under one million to around three million viewers depending on the show), most of Tribune Broadcasting's CW-affiliated stations – with the exception of WPIX in New York City, KTLA in Los Angeles and flagship station WGN-TV in Chicago, all of which already used limited network branding – adopted revised on-air brands beginning in 2008 that de-emphasized their ties to the network. In July 2008, the station changed its branding to the simplified \"KDAF 33\", before rebranding as \"The 33\" that September as part of a corporate effort by Tribune to strengthen the local branding of its stations and reduce the dependence on the use of references to The CW in its stations' branding in part due to the network's weak national ratings. The \"CW 33\" name eventually returned full-time in September 2011, as Tribune's CW stations began restoring network references in their branding.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. In its earlier structures, the deal would have resulted in KDAF and its Houston sister, KIAH gaining sister stations in seven other markets within Texas: Abilene (ABC affiliate KTXS-TV as well as San Angelo semi-repeater KTXE-LD), Austin (CBS affiliate KEYE-TV), Amarillo (ABC affiliate KVII-TV and Clovis, New Mexico satellite station KVIH-TV), San Antonio (the virtual triopoly of NBC affiliate WOAI-TV, Fox affiliate KABB and CW affiliate KMYS), El Paso (CBS affiliate KDBC-TV and Fox affiliate KFOX-TV), Harlingen (CBS affiliate KGBT-TV), and Beaumont–Port Arthur (the virtual duopoly of Fox affiliate KBTV-TV and CBS-CW affiliate KFDM).\n\nOn April 24, 2018, Sinclair announced that KDAF and KIAH would be acquired by Baltimore-based Cunningham Broadcasting (which has its non-voting stock controlled and, until January of that year, had been majority owned by the estate of the late Carolyn Smith, mother of executive chairman David D. Smith and widow of company founder Julian S. Smith) for $60 million. Sinclair originally planned to retain operational stewardship of KDAF through a shared services agreement (SSA) with Cunningham; this would have formed a virtual duopoly with Greenville-licensed Stadium affiliate KTXD-TV (channel 47), which Cunningham had acquired from Dallas-based London Broadcasting Company in September 2017. (Sinclair concurrently proposed selling CW-affiliated sister WPIX in New York City to Cunningham, which intended to lease the operations of that station to Sinclair under a master service agreement (MSA); however, FCC and Department of Justice scrutiny over that proposal led Sinclair to seek to directly acquire WPIX on April 24.)\n\nIn a revised filing submitted on July 18, Sinclair disclosed it would instead sell KDAF as well as KIAH to an independent third party in order to address concerns expressed by FCC chairman Ajit Pai two days before, concerning the partner licensees Sinclair proposed using to allow it to operate certain Tribune stations while materially reducing Sinclair's national ownership cap space short of the 39% limit. (For this reason, Sinclair also proposed directly acquiring independent station WGN-TV in Chicago, rescinding a proposed sale of the Tribune television flagship to WGN-TV LLC – a limited liability company to have been owned by Steven Fader, a Maryland automotive dealer and business associate of David Smith – which was to have leased WGN's operations to Sinclair under an MSA.) Despite this, that same day, the FCC Commissioners' Board voted unanimously, 4-0, to send the Sinclair-Tribune acquisition proposal to an evidentiary review hearing before an administrative law judge, a move largely seen among media analysts as a potential downfall for the deal. On August 9, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, and concurrently filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the DOJ over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving-based Nexstar Media Group announced it would acquire Tribune's assets for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal—which made Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations upon closure of the deal—gave KDAF additional sister stations nearby markets including Lawton–Wichita Falls (NBC affiliate KFDX-TV and SSA partners KJTL [Fox] and KJBO-LP [MyNetworkTV]), Waco–Bryan–College Station (Fox affiliate KWKT-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate KYLE-TV), Tyler–Longview (NBC affiliate KETK-TV and SSA partners KFXK-TV [Fox] and KTPN-LD [MyNetworkTV]) and Abilene (CBS affiliate KTAB-TV and NBC-affiliated SSA partner KRBC-TV). Given that Nexstar's operations are based in the Metroplex, it is unclear whether KDAF will be designated as a flagship outlet for the group (either as a sole flagship or in conjunction with one of the three Tribune-owned stations in the three largest U.S. markets). The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16, and was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKDAF first launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 33.2 in July 2006, initially operating as a charter affiliate of The Tube; it carried The Tube until parent company Tube Music Network, LLC shut down the network's operations on October 1, 2007. The subchannel remained in operation without programming until November 1, 2007, when it became an affiliate of the Spanish language network LATV; that network was dropped by KDAF in June 2010. The 33.2 subchannel was later reactivated as a charter affiliate of Antenna TV upon the launch of the Tribune-owned classic television network on January 1, 2011.\n\nKDAF launched a tertiary digital subchannel on virtual channel 33.3 on December 7, 2010 as an affiliate of This TV, through the film-focused network's affiliation agreement with Tribune (which would eventually acquire Weigel Broadcasting's 50% equity share of the network in November 2013). This TV had previously been carried by ABC affiliate WFAA, which had earlier replaced it on the station's 8.2 subchannel with the lifestyle-focused Live Well Network on November 8, 2010. On May 8, 2019, KDAF-DT3 became an affiliate of the revived Court TV, which made available on November 1, 2019.\n\nKDAF launched a fourth digital subchannel on virtual channel 33.4 on January 3, 2018 as an affiliate of Charge!.\n\nKDAF shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 33, at 8 a.m. on June 12, 2009, as part the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 32, using PSIP to display KDAF's virtual channel as 33 on digital television receivers.\n\nKDAF currently carries the entire CW programming schedule; however, as many Tribune Broadcasting stations affiliated with the network have done since September 2013, it airs The CW Daytime block at an earlier time slot than is recommended of The CW's other Central Time Zone affiliates; the block aired two hours earlier than standard (at 1:00 p.m.) from that point until September 2017, when KDAF began carrying the CW daytime talk show \"The Robert Irvine Show\" on a day-behind basis at 9:00 a.m. each weekday. Syndicated programs broadcast by KDAF () include \"Impractical Jokers\", \"The Steve Wilkos Show\", \"South Park\", \"The Goldbergs\", \"Maury\", \"Bob's Burgers\", \"Two and a Half Men\", \"Judge Jerry\" and \"Mom\".\n\nFrom February 2016 until October 2018, KDAF aired 32 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and three hours on Sundays).\n\nAfter Channel 33 was sold to Metromedia, its new owners heavily invested in the creation of a news department for the-then KRLD-TV, acquiring modernized technology (including a computer system and several Sony Betacams) for production and newsgathering resources. The station's news staff was based in a small trailer parked within the Harry Hines Boulevard studios, before moving into the larger Carpenter Freeway facility shortly before the newscast's launch. On July 30, 1984, Channel 33 debuted a nightly hour-long newscast at 7:00 p.m., the first local prime time news program ever attempted on a commercial television station in the Dallas-Fort Worth market (it was the first prime time newscast to air in the market overall since PBS member station KERA-TV (channel 13) cancelled its evening news program, the \"13 Report\", in 1977). However, its debut was less than auspicious, earning at .7 rating (amounting to less than seven-tenths of 1% of all households in the Dallas–Fort Worth market that watched the premiere broadcast), eventually rising to a peak of 2.0 within several months; although its ratings peak still well below the 4.0 target share that was promised to advertisers, \"Dallas Morning News\" television critic Ed Bark later noted that the program suffered from the lack of a strong lead-in, even though it performed better than many of the station's syndicated programs. The program, however, would earn two United Press International awards in 1985 for \"Best Newscast in Texas\" and \"Best Spot News\" (for its coverage of the 1985 Mesquite tornado). In an effort to increase viewership for the 7:00 p.m. newscast, KRLD-TV launched an extensive promotional campaign that included billboards with such taglines as \"Hey [name of anchor], now you too can watch the news/weather/sports\" (incorporating the names of popular anchors at its competitors, including KDFW evening anchor Clarice Tinsley, WFAA evening anchor Tracy Rowlett and sports director Dale Hansen, and KXAS chief meteorologist Harold Taft).\n\nThe news department underwent tumultuous changes in 1986; after original news director Tony deHaro (who previously served in that same role at KRLD radio prior to Metromedia's purchase of Channel 33) was fired by the station, he wrote a scathing letter to \"D Magazine\" criticizing the news department and KRLD-TV general manager Ray Schonbak, stating that Schonbak insisted on implementing \"sensationalis[tic] and inflammatory\" journalism techniques. At the time, station management acquired a state-of-the-art microwave live truck for newsgathering and drafted plans to open a bureau in Fort Worth. On May 10, 1986, shortly after News Corporation assumed control of the station following the completion of its merger with Metromedia, Schonbak announced Channel 33's news department would shut down, stating to staff that the move was his decision; in an August 1986 article that he wrote for \"D Magazine\", former anchor Quin Mathews (who joined KRLD from KDFW in 1984, and was later hired by WFAA as its morning and midday anchor after Channel 33's news department folded) questioned whether the move was solely that of Schonbak or a directive by News Corporation management, despite the company's efforts to expand news programming on its soon-to-be Fox O&Os, noting that Schonbak had given Fox executives five different options for the news department to improve revenue and ratings, all of which were considered by the board to be unacceptable (at the time of the merger, then-sister stations WNYW, KTTV and WTTG had maintained news departments that were either established under the previous ownership of Metromedia or by predecessor owners, while Fox Television Stations launched a news department that year at WFLD; news programming on each of the stations consisted almost exclusively of prime time newscasts).\n\nWith an increase in revenues by the early 1990s, Fox Television Stations announced plans to re-establish KDAF's news department and launch a prime time newscast at 9:00 p.m., later setting August 1, 1994 as the program's projected premiere date. Then-general manager Lisa Gregorisch (now a television producer based at Time Warner subsidiary Telepictures) began hiring a \"dream team\" of reporters, editors, producers and photographers to staff the news operation, which she stated in an interview with the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" \"would have 'shaken up this news market like never before'.\" These plans were shelved when Fox decided to affiliate with KDFW – which already had a functioning news department and a sizeable amount of local news programming that would be expanded upon following the switch – as part of its affiliation agreement with New World Communications, and sell KDAF in turn. Fox was already beginning to phase in news departments on most of its stations, gradually expanding beyond its O&Os to affiliates that did not already produce news; the New World stations were among the first aligned with the network to take on a news-intensive format, which mixed newscasts in both common time slots, and time slots normally ceded to morning and early-evening national news programs, and late prime time shows on CBS, ABC and NBC. Most of those hired as part of the aborted operation – around 20 people that were already hired and several others, including some on-air personalities, that made commitments to join the staff – either were able to re-sign in their previous positions at other stations or were placed by the group in positions at other Fox Television Stations properties.\n\nPlans to re-establish a news department for KDAF were revived under Tribune Broadcasting ownership later in the decade, as part of the company's efforts to launch in-house newscasts on the group's WB affiliates. In January 1999, the station began producing a half-hour newscast at 9:00 p.m. that initially aired only on weeknights. Debuting as \"WB 33 News @ Nine\", it was first anchored by Patrick Greenlaw and Crystal Thornton, alongside chief meteorologist Steve LaNore and sports director Bob Irzyk. The program was expanded to seven days a week in January 2000, with Dawn Tongish appointed as weekend anchor; the Monday through Friday editions were then expanded to one hour in January 2001, with the weekend newscasts following suit by 2003. The KDAF 9:00 p.m. newscast continually placed a very distant second behind KDFW's established hour-long prime time newscast, \"Fox 4 News at 9:00\", which had grown to become the ratings leader in that time slot since its debut upon Channel 4's July 1995 switch to Fox under the KDFW news department's former \"News 4 Texas\" brand. In September 2005, the station debuted \"DFW Close-Up\", a half-hour public affairs program which aired on Sunday mornings until September 2013.\n\nIn late February 2009, anchors Tom Crespo and Terri Chappell – who had served as main anchors of the program since 2004 and 2003, respectively – were replaced on the weeknight newscasts by existing general assignment reporter Amanda Salinas (later Fitzpatrick) and Walt Maciborski (the latter of whom joined KDAF from ABC affiliate WFTS-TV in Tampa). On September 21, 2009, KDAF debuted a nightly half-hour newscast at 5:30 p.m. to compete with part of KDFW's hour-long 5:00 newscast as well as the network newscasts on KTVT, KXAS-TV and WFAA; the program utilized a different format that featured former station interns as full-time reporters, as well as some new feature segments that would be considered irrelevant for the 9:00 p.m. broadcast.\nOn March 1, 2010, KDAF expanded the early evening newscast to a full hour on weekdays from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. (the weekend editions continued to air for a half-hour at 5:30, competing against national newscasts on WFAA, KXAS and KTVT on Saturdays as an earlier local news alternative, and local newscasts on KTVT, WFAA and KDFW and a national network newscast on KXAS on Sundays). The weekday editions of that newscast was subsequently reduced to a half-hour on May 3, now solely competing against local newscasts on KDFW, WFAA, KXAS and KTVT; the 5:30 p.m. half-hour of the broadcast was replaced by off-network syndicated sitcoms. On May 22, 2010, KDAF became the last remaining English language television station in the Dallas-Fort Worth market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. Unlike the other stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, video shot during field reports is recorded and broadcast in true high definition. The market's other four news-producing stations broadcast studio segments in HD, but, at the time, video footage during field reports shot for their newscasts was recorded in widescreen standard definition.\n\nOn October 31, 2011, KDAF began airing the Tribune-distributed morning news program \"EyeOpener\", which originally premiered six months earlier on May 9 as a test concept on Houston sister station KIAH. Initially airing only on weekday mornings (for three hours starting at 5:00 a.m.), before expanding to include hour-long weekend editions in April 2015, the program's hybrid format is billed as a \"provocative and unpredictable\" combination of daily news, lifestyle, entertainment and opinion segments. All national content is produced at KDAF's Carpenter Freeway studios, which, in conjunction with KDAF's acquisition of the local rights to \"EyeOpener\", replaced its corporate parent's Tribune Tower headquarters in Chicago as the program's main production base. Local news, weather and traffic updates are also presented live during each half-hour by a solo anchor at the KDAF studios; local news and traffic reports were first presented by Nerissa Knight, who served as the program's national news segment anchor (and was a former anchor at KTVT), while weather segments were presented by meteorologist Krista Villarreal (formerly of KXAS-TV). Tribune gradually began syndicating the program to its stations in four additional markets (Philadelphia, Miami, Portland, Oregon and Fort Smith, Arkansas), as well as a non-Tribune station in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, all of which provide local news and weather segments during the program.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, KDAF's news department underwent a series of staff departures: following ratings declines during his tenure, news director David Duitch left the station in July to become website editor for \"The Dallas Morning News\"; that August saw the departures of chief meteorologist Bob Goosmann and sports reporter Chase Williams, the resignation of reporter Giselle Phelps and Walt MacIborski's departure for Fox-affiliated sister station WXIN in Indianapolis. On August 16 of that year, \"EyeOpener\" senior producer Larissa Hall was promoted to a director of content position to oversee the newscasts.\n\nOn September 4, 2012, KDAF management announced in a meeting with station staff that it would adopt a format similar to \"EyeOpener\" for the 5:00 and 9:00 p.m. newscasts, in order to reduce production and operation costs for the news department, and to make the broadcast profitable. The evening newscasts were revamped under the \"Nightcap\" concept on November 1, 2012; the program made use of multimedia journalists (which require a single person to film, edit and report news stories) and incorporated humor within most of its story content, except for news items and feature pieces that warranted a more serious tone. New staff members were hired to anchor and report for the newscasts, while about half of the newsroom staff (including several employees that were with KDAF since the current news department's inception in 1999) had been laid off.\n\nEven with the format switch, KDAF remained in last place among Dallas–Fort Worth's news-producing English stations, with viewership having declined to the point of registering \"hashmarks\" (indicating viewership too low to register a ratings point) on some nights during the initial switch to the \"Nightcap\" format. Ratings slowly increased over the next year-and-a-half while the format was instituted, particularly in the key age demographic of adults 25–54. Larissa Hall, who oversaw \"Nightcap's\" launch as KDAF's director of content, left the station at the end of 2012, shifting to other duties within the Tribune corporate umbrella and giving \"Nightcap\" only partial oversight.\n\nIn November 2013, KDAF hired Steve Simon (a former weekend anchor-turned-producer at KIAH) as its news director. While in Houston, Simon helped launch \"NewsFix\", a stylized news format that first launched in March 2011 on KIAH and described by that station's general manager Roger Bare as \"a newsreel updated for the 21st century,\" which de-emphasized on-camera anchors and reporters – using only an off-camera narrator for continuity to place more of a direct focus on footage involving those tied to the story – requiring a far smaller staff than most news programs. Many on-air members of the KDAF news staff departed in the months prior to the format change, including longtime reporter Barry Carpenter and anchor Amanda Fitzpatrick, both of whom were with the station prior to the adoption of the \"Nightcap\" format. \"NewsFix\" officially debuted on May 20, 2014, beginning with the 5:00 p.m. broadcast, with Greg Onofrio – a Houston radio personality who also continues to serve in the same capacity on the KIAH edition of the program – serving as its narrator, in addition to making on-screen appearances for a commentary segment at the end of the broadcast. The weekday early-evening edition expanded to an hour on September 7, 2015. On September 6, 2018, Tribune announced that \"NewsFix\" would be cancelled effective September 14; \"Morning Dose\", the successor program to \"EyeOpener\", was concurrently cancelled effective October 19. \n\nOn March 13, 2019, the station began a partnership with Urban One, where the morning show from radio station KBFB (97.9 FM), \"Veda Loca in the Morning\", was simulcast on KDAF from 6 to 8 a.m. During that time, it was known on-air as \"The Beat on 33\". The partnership quietly ended on January 3, 2020 when \"Veda Loca in the Morning\" itself was cancelled.\n\n\n"}

Chalmers Doane, a music educator and member of the Order of Canada, Doane learned many instruments at a young age, including piano, bass guitar, mandolin, guitar, violin. After high school, she studied music at Dalhousie University with the intention of becoming a music teacher. Her career path changed after she received a role in Neptune Theatre's production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" in 1986. She was cast regularly in productions at Neptune for two years before moving to Toronto in 1988. Over the next few years Doane played roles in various theatre productions, including \"Fire!\" and \"Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story\" on Broadway.\n\nIn 1993, Doane released the EP \"Harvest Train\" independently. Some of the songs drew the attention of Sony Music Canada, and she was signed to the label. She recorded her debut album, \"Shakespearean Fish\" in 1996.\n\nAlthough the album wasn't a hit on commercial radio, it was noticed by record producer Rick Neigher in Los Angeles. He worked with Doane on the second album, \"Adam's Rib\" (1998). The title song became the album's first Top 40 hit, followed by \"Waiting for the Tide\", \"Goliath\", and \"Happy Homemaker\". She toured in support of the album for two years with Jann Arden, Great Big Sea, The Philosopher Kings, and Lilith Fair.\n\nIn 1999, Doane won the Juno Award for New Artist of the Year. After touring, she left Sony Music Canada. Through a partnership with Ted Dykstra and actor Gary Sinise, she began working on another album with Neigher in Los Angeles. She gave birth and worked as a session musician. She wrote songs with SHeDAISY, starred in the independent film \"Black Swan\", and released the album \"Melvin Live\".\n\n\"You Are What You Love\" was released by Actorboy Records and Warner Music Canada. The single \"Still Desire You\" reached the Top 5 at Canadian radio stations and its accompanying music video reached No. 1 on MuchMoreMusic's viewer's choice countdown. During promotion, she gave birth to her second child.\n\nIn 2007 she Doane began working on an album that was inspired by motherhood. Initially dubbed a lullaby album, the resulting independent release \"A Thousand Nights\" had much wider appeal, mixing covers by Fleetwood Mac, The Everly Brothers, and Leonard Cohen with originals by Doane and including guests Jim Cuddy, Ron Sexsmith, Kathryn Rose, Emilie-Claire Barlow, and Ted Dykstra. Released in 2008, \"A Thousand Nights\" was preceded by the lead single \"Songbird\" featuring Cuddy, which became a Top 5 hit on the iTunes country singles chart in Canada. Doane's \"Every Little Thing\" and \"Chopin Ballad\" each received placements in the television shows \"Being Erica\" and \"Flashpoint\". In 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2013, she was the featured entertainer on the Canadian Pacific Railway Holiday Train Tour. Each tour consisted of approximately 60 shows over the span of three weeks in various communities in the United States and Canada.\n\nDoane began working on a new studio album in 2009 with her brother and drummer Creighton Doane at his studio in Toronto. Throughout the recording process, early demos of tracks \"Back To LA\", \"Make God Laugh\", \"From Your Lips to God's Ears\", \"Sweet on You\", and \"The Stupider I Am\" were given away as free downloads via Doane's official website. In the summer of 2010, \"Sweet on You\" reached #1 on the \"East Coast Countdown\", a popular radio show in Atlantic Canada. In December 2010, \"The Emerald City\" was announced with a March 1, 2011 release date.\n\nShortly after the release of \"The Emerald City\" in 2011, Doane was asked to audition for the role of \"Song Woman\" in Mirvish's Toronto production of the acclaimed play \"War Horse\". She was offered the role and began rehearsals for the production in December 2011. The play opened at the Princess of Wales Theatre in February 2012 to rave reviews, and eventually closed after a successful run on January 6, 2013. Of Doane's role in the production, \"Toronto Star\"<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s Richard Ouzounian wrote:\nThrough it all, the soaringly symphonic score of Adrian Sutton contrasts with the simple songs selected by John Tams, sung here with poignant effect by Melanie Doane.\n\nPat Donnelly of Postmedia News wrote:\nThe manner in which traditional songs (performed principally, in this production by the multi-talented Melanie Doane, who does wonders with voice and violin) are deftly woven into the narrative, uplifting it into anthem, is masterful.\n\n\nIn 2009-2010, Melanie volunteered to teach a small group of students at her children's school in Toronto using the method of ukulele instruction established by her father, J. Chalmers Doane in the 1960s. Now a registered charity, Doane Uschool (www.uschool.ca) teaches over 750 students each week in schools throughout Toronto. Melanie lends exposure to her groups through concerts, recording projects and appearances in the PanAm Games, with Chris Hadfield in the International Space Station, the CBC Music Festival and the 2018 Luminato Festival.\n\n\n\n"}

It was directed by the Hughes Brothers, the filmmakers behind \"Menace II Society\" and \"Dead Presidents\". \nThe documentary consists of first person interviews of people involved in the pimping lifestyle (\"the game\"). The interviews are separated by short clips from 1970s blaxploitation films such as \"Willie Dynamite\", \"The Mack\", and \"Dolemite\".\n\nThe first portion of the documentary focuses on pimps working illegally. The illegal pimps that are interviewed are from all over the United States, e.g., Charm from Hawaii, Fillmore Slim from San Francisco, and Payroll from Las Vegas. These pimps, and many others discuss their theories on the history of prostitution. The pimps go on to talk about their philosophy on pimping, and how they live their daily life.\n\nThe film also discusses the legal sector of prostitution. Dennis Hof, the owner of the Bunny Ranch in Nevada, is interviewed. He feels that Nevada is much smarter than the other states because they have imposed the proper health and background checks on prostitution, instead of trying to suppress prostitution by making it illegal.\n\nThe majority of the documentary glorifies the pimping lifestyle. The pimps and prostitutes interviewed mainly discuss the perks of the lifestyle. They talk about the money they have made, and the expensive suits and cars they were able to buy. However, near the end of the film, the interviews involve prostitutes that have died from the lifestyle as well as pimps who have retired and hold straight jobs or those who are now in jail.\n\n\nA 2009 HBO drama based on \"American Pimp\" that planned to examine the world of prostitution in Oakland, California came under fire from then Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums and other city officials before filming had begun. The planned show, called \"Gentlemen of Leisure\" would have focused on a pimp in his 40s and his attempts to get out of the business.\n\nDellums worried about the impact \"Gentlemen of Leisure\" would have had on Oakland's image. \"It is the mayor's view that this project goes against our vision of Oakland as a 'model city' and does a disservice to residents and visitors alike,\" Dellums' Chief of Staff, David Chai, said. \"While the mayor understands that there are certain benefits to having a major film project in our city, he is not willing to support this project at this time. The people of Oakland have come too far to have our city's name trampled upon in the name of entertainment.\"\n\n\n"}

She was married at the age of fifteen to a nobleman and bore children by him. She convinced her husband of, and raised her children in a contemplative and mystical form of Christianity. He died while they were on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and Jutta became a single mother. Each child eventually entered a monastery upon reaching a suitable age, and this left Jutta able to pursue a more austere religious way of life.\n\nJutta became a member of the Third Order of St. Francis. She gave away or sold her property and lived the rest of her life in contemplation and in caring for the poor and the sick. She became a figure of ridicule among her neighbors as she carried out her service to the poor of the region.\n\nIn her last years, Jutta moved to the frontier of Christian Europe. She chose as her base a derelict building in Bildschön (now Bielczyny), near Kulmsee in Prussia, part of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Order, the area governed by the Teutonic Knights, whose Grand Master, Anno von Sangershausen, was a relative of hers. There the knights sheltered her. Visitors came to her to receive counsel and prayers, and she quickly established a reputation as a saint. She said that there were three things that can bring one near to God:painful sickness, exile from home, and poverty voluntarily accepted for God. She dedicated her final days to praying for the non-Christian population of the region.\n\nShe died around 1260. In keeping with her wishes, Archbishop Friar Heidenreich of Kulm, O.P., earlier Archbishop of Armagh, Ireland, and now first Bishop of Kulm, had her buried at the cathedral. A \"cultus\" developed around her immediately and the Kulmsee cathedral became a destination for pilgrims. In the Roman Catholic Church, she is honored as the patron saint of Prussia, and her feast day is observed on 5 May.\n\n"}

{"id": "1838125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838125", "title": "New Super Mario Bros.", "text": "New Super Mario Bros.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros\" was commercially successful and received positive reviews; praise went towards its improvements made to the \"Mario\" franchise, while criticism was targeted at its simplicity and similarity to previous games. It sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling game for the Nintendo DS and one of the best-selling video games of all time. The game's success led to a line of sequels released for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros.\" is a side-scrolling video game. While it is seen in 2D, most of the characters and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. The player can play as either Mario, or his brother, Luigi. Similar to previous \"Mario\" games, Mario or Luigi can collect coins, stomp on enemies, and break open blocks. Moves from 3D \"Mario\" games reappear in \"New Super Mario Bros.\", including the ground pound, triple jump, and wall jump. Enemies from previous games, such as Boos, are also reintroduced.\n\nTen levels are available in each of eight worlds, which are shown in the Nintendo DS's bottom touchscreen while viewing the world map. The map of the currently selected world appears in the top screen, which is used to navigate between the world's levels. The goal of each level is to reach a black flag at the end of the level. At the end of each world, a boss must be defeated before proceeding to the next world. There are six power-ups available in \"New Super Mario Bros.\"; the game allows the player to store an extra power-up when he is already using one, a feature carried over from \"Super Mario World\". Three power-ups from \"Super Mario Bros.\" return: the Super Mushroom makes Mario grow in size, the Fire Flower lets Mario throw fireballs, and the Starman makes Mario temporarily invincible. Three more power-ups are introduced in \"New Super Mario Bros.\": the Blue Koopa Shell lets Mario withdraw into a shell to protect himself and perform \"shell dash\" attack, the Mega Mushroom grows Mario to an incredible size, and the Mini-Mushroom makes Mario very small.\n\nThe game's multiplayer mode pits two players against each other as they play as Mario and Luigi in one of five stages, trying to be the first to obtain a preset number of stars. Both players can attack each other in attempts to steal the other player's stars. Jumping on the opponent's character will make them lose one star, while performing a ground pound will lose them three. In addition, some minigames previously available in \"Super Mario 64 DS\" have returned and now offer multiplayer options for added replay value. The minigames are divided into four categories: Action, Puzzle, Table and Variety. \"New Super Mario Bros.\" contains eighteen minigames for single players and ten minigames for multiple players. \n\nMario and Princess Peach are walking together when lightning suddenly strikes Peach's castle nearby. As Mario runs to investigate, Bowser Jr. appears, sneaking up on the Princess from behind and kidnapping her. Realizing what has happened, Mario quickly rushes back and gives chase. Mario ventures through eight worlds pursuing Bowser Jr. and trying to rescue the kidnapped princess. Mario catches up to them and confronts Bowser Jr. occasionally, but is unable to save the princess from the young Koopa's clutches. At the end of the first world, Bowser Jr. retreats to a castle, where his father, Bowser, awaits Mario on a bridge over a pit filled with lava. In a scene highly reminiscent of the original \"Super Mario Bros.\", Mario activates a button behind Bowser to defeat him, and the bridge underneath Bowser collapses, causing him to fall into the lava which burns his flesh, leaving a skeleton.\n\nThough Bowser was defeated in the first level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the remaining worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. He looks at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.\n\nNintendo announced on February 21, 2006 that \"New Super Mario Bros.\" would launch for the Nintendo DS on May 7, 2006. The game's new power-ups were also introduced at the same time, including the Blue Koopa Shell and the Mega Mushroom. Nintendo further mentioned that the game would be played in 2D but use 3D models to create a 2.5D look and feel. The May 7 release was later delayed towards May 21, but the game's release date was eventually pushed back slightly to May 15; Nintendo also planned to release it around the same time that the Nintendo DS Lite launched, on June 11, 2006.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros.\" is the first 2D platform game to star Mario since \"Super Mario Advance 4\" in 2003. First revealed at the 2004 E3 convention, \"New Super Mario Bros.\" was available for play at E3 in 2005. The game's designers were given much more freedom with designs in \"New Super Mario Bros.\" compared to previous 2D \"Mario\" games. Characters, enemies, and objects could now be created with much more detailed animations, without requiring that they be designed by hand. To provide visual cues, the developers made the game's camera more dynamic; it zooms in and out of action depending on the situation to provide focus where necessary.\n\nPhysics play an important role in \"New Super Mario Bros.\"s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.\n\nEarly in the game's development, the developers planned not to use voice acting to stay true to the spirit of the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" However, voice acting was eventually embraced by the developers, who decided that it would serve the game in a positive manner. Although voice acting was used in earlier 2D \"Mario\" remakes, \"New Super Mario Bros.\" is the first original 2D \"Mario\" game to use voice acting. Charles Martinet returned to voice Mario and Luigi, along with Nicole Mills as Princess Peach, Scott Burns as Bowser, and Dolores Rogers as Bowser Jr. \"New Super Mario Bros.\" features original music composed by Asuka Ohta and Hajime Wakai, under the direction of the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" composer, Koji Kondo, who also created the \"Aboveground BGM\", the main theme for regular levels. The game's music dictates gameplay; enemies jump and dance in time to the music. Predicting enemy movements, players can time their jumps with enemy movements to reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros.\" was released by Nintendo in North America on May 15, 2006, in Japan on May 25, 2006, and in Europe on June 30, 2006. Nintendo did not specify why it chose to delay the game's release in its home market of Japan by ten days, but GameSpot noted that \"it stands to reason that the company simply wants a few more days to build inventory.\" In Japan, over 480,000 units of \"New Super Mario Bros.\" were sold on the day it was released and 900,000 copies in the first four days. At the time, it was the best-selling debut for a Nintendo DS game in Japan, but it has since been surpassed by \"Pokémon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\". It is Japan's 26th best-selling game in 2008. In the United States, 500,000 copies of \"New Super Mario Bros.\" were sold in the first 35 days, and one million copies were sold twelve weeks after its release. Worldwide sales have steadily increased throughout the years, with five million copies by April 2008, eighteen million by March 2009, and 30.8 million by March 2016, making it the best-selling game for the Nintendo DS and one of the best-selling video games of all time.\n\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, with several calling \"New Super Mario Bros.\" one of the best games available for the Nintendo DS. GameZone believed that it was the \"hot game\" to purchase for any DS owner, noting its \"huge exploration potential\" and reinvention of the platform game genre. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer stated, \"I've done this sort of thing before hundreds of times across thousands of days in what feels like a dozen \"Mario\" games. I still love it.\" Believing that experienced players would require very little time to complete the game, GameSpot nevertheless considered \"New Super Mario Bros.\" a \"completely awesome\" game that was an \"absolutely necessary\" video game to own. GamesRadar considered the game a bargain, noting that it included \"a completely solid solo game, a simple-but-exciting two-player, and then a collection of super-quick stylus games\".\n\nSeveral reviewers drew comparisons between \"New Super Mario Bros.\" and their favorite \"Mario\" games. Although some found that other \"Mario\" games were better, most reviewers were still pleased with the overall experience of the game. Some fans however, criticized the game for its low difficulty compared to other Mario games. Craig Harris of IGN was enthused with \"New Super Mario Bros.\", stating that it was his new favorite platform game, beating out his previous favorite, \"\". Even though \"Super Mario World\" and \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" were considered the best 2D \"Mario\" games by \"GamePro\"'s Mr. Marbles, he decided to add \"New Super Mario Bros.\" as his third favorite \"Mario\" game, which he admitted had much more replay value than the other two. Though the game includes new features such as a versus mode, Game Revolution disconcertedly asked the question, \"Can Mario ever truly be new again?\". It also disappointed Greg Sewart of X-Play, who found that the game did not live up to the standards set by its predecessors, but still considered the game the best side-scrolling video game available for the Nintendo DS.\n\nThe game's graphics and audio received praise in a number of reviews. The \"Computer and Video Games\" magazine was entertained by the \"finely crafted slice of Mario\", along with the extra minigames offered. They believed that the audio was very good for a Nintendo DS game, predicting that \"it'd still scare the pants off the hard-of-hearing.\" Though being a 2D game, GameSpy still found that the 2D and 3D elements blended together perfectly in \"New Super Mario Bros.\" The game's overall experience pleased 1UP.com, which applauded Nintendo's ability to once again create an enjoyable, solid, and challenging portable experience. However, they were disappointed in the lack of imagination for this remake.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros.\" received numerous awards and accolades. It was given Game of the Month awards from \"Game Informer\" and \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", and it received Editors' Choice Awards from IGN and GameSpot. The game was voted Best Handheld Game at the 2006 Spike Video Game Awards, Best Nintendo DS Game by GameSpot, and it won Best Platformer awards from X-Play and \"Nintendo Power\". The game was awarded Choice Video Game at the 2006 Teen Choice Awards, and Nintendo Game of the Year at the 2006 Golden Joystick Award.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\", a successor to \"New Super Mario Bros.\", was released internationally for the Wii in 2009. It features similar gameplay to its predecessor, with several of the same power-ups returning as well as brand-new ones. The game is the first \"Super Mario\" game to feature cooperative gameplay for up to four people, allowing players to control Mario, Luigi, and two different toads colored yellow and blue. A direct sequel \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" was later released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" was then released for the Wii U in 2012, and its port titled \"New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe\" was released on the Nintendo Switch on January 11, 2019.\n"}

It was the original home of influential Minnesota bands the Replacements and Soul Asylum and was instrumental in helping the Twin Cities music scene achieve national attention in the 1980s. Along with other independent American labels such as SST Records, Touch and Go Records, and Dischord, Twin/Tone helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.\n\nTwin/Tone originated in the Minneapolis punk rock scene, which included venues like Jay's Longhorn Bar. The label was begun by Peter Jesperson, local music and sports writer Charley Hallman, and Paul Stark. Releases by the pop/rock group The Suburbs were both Twin/Tone's first release (\"The Suburbs EP\" in 1978) and its last (\"Viva! Suburbs!\" in 1994). Jesperson signed the Replacements to the label immediately after the band's debut at the Longhorn Bar in Minneapolis.

This would naturally require in most cases reporting directly to the owner or CEO overseeing the very business on which the CLO is expected to be familiar with and advise on the most confidential level. This requires the CLO/general counsel to work closely with each of the other officers, and their departments, to appropriately be aware and advise.\n\nHistorically, general counsel often handled administrative tasks while outside lawyers in private practice handled more complex legal work. Since the 1980s, however, the general counsel position has become increasingly prominent in multinational companies, often directly advising the board of directors in place of outside lawyers. General counsel are now often among the most highly paid executives of major American corporations, and prominent American government lawyers and law firm partners are often hired for general counsel roles at prominent companies. Similar trends are also being seen in the United Kingdom and other countries.\n\nGeneral counsel often have broad roles encompassing crisis management, compliance reporting management and public policy advocacy. Many companies also hire in-house counsel to handle specialized tasks such as tax work, mergers and acquisitions, labor law and intellectual property, sometimes building in-house practice groups that rival the practices of major law firms.\n\nThe Association of Corporate Counsel (\"ACC\") has 35,000 general counsel, chief legal officer and other in-house counsel members located in 90 countries. ACC was founded as the American Corporate Counsel Association in 1982 and now includes more than 55 chapters, including in Argentina, Canada (four chapters), Europe, Israel, the Middle East and Singapore. Members have access to networking opportunities and education events through their regional chapter affiliations as well as global connections across practice area, job title and industry. ACC provides members with resources to deliver services and advice to their companies, promotes the value of in-house legal services and advocates on behalf of general counsel. For its general counsel and chief legal officer members, ACC hosts roundtables where members discuss current practice trends and issues.\n\nThe Forum is an association of 700 general counsel and senior managing counsel. The non-profit organization was founded in the fall of 1998 as the Dallas-Fort Worth General Counsel's Management Practices Forum (“DFWGCMPF”). The association is a partnership between in-house members and outside counsel, known as underwriters. Members are general counsel and managing counsel of corporations, non-profit organizations and government agencies. The mission of the Forum is to improve the professional lives of general counsel and managing counsel through meaningful opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction and knowledge exchange, mentoring through professional development in legal best practices, ethics, governance, and compliance. In November 2000, the DFWGCMPF changed its name to The Texas General Counsel Forum, also known as The Forum, and in the following year the Houston Chapter was formed, and then the Austin-San Antonio Chapter was founded. In July 2005, the Forum hired a Chief Executive Officer with the mandate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization, expand membership, and launch the organization nationally. In November 2009, the Board of Directors approved expanding the Forum nationally, and dropped the reference to Texas, becoming simply The General Counsel Forum. In the fall of 2012, the General Counsel Forum founded the Chicago Chapter.\n\nThe Silicon Valley Association of General Counsel (SVAGC) is a business league of chief legal officers from over 100 leading companies in the technology and life science sectors. Member companies include publicly traded corporations, private ventures and multinational subsidiaries located throughout the San Francisco Bay Area with operations in software, electronics, power technology, biotechnology, medical devices, health informatics, analytics, materials science, cleantech, fintech, telecommunications, network infrastructure, e-commerce and Internet services, artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nThe SVAGC hosts a series of monthly luncheons featuring expert presentations and off-the-record discussion about topics of professional interest. It also assists members who wish to survey their peers or pose questions on particular issues, and cooperates in special projects such as the \"All Hands Meeting\", an annual multi-track conference at the Santa Clara Convention Center, attended by general and staff counsel from hundreds of member and nonmember legal departments in the technology and life science sectors.\n\nThe SVAGC is a successor to the Peninsula Association of General Counsel (PAGC), formed in the early 1980s. In 2003, the SVAGC was formally organized as a California mutual benefit nonprofit corporation with the assistance of Ivy Associates, a consultancy to the Silicon Valley legal community that provides organizational support for the SVAGC and produces the All Hands Meeting. Only SVAGC members, speakers and invited guests may attend monthly luncheons, which are funded by modest membership dues. Individuals may join the SVAGC when they are the chief legal officer of a company with operations in Northern California that is publicly traded or which meets alternative criteria for private companies. Some SVAGC members serve as general counsel for companies headquartered outside Northern California, and attend meetings when business travel brings them into the SF Bay Area.\n\nIn the United Kingdom a group of general counsel, called the GC100, was officially launched on 9 March 2005 and brings together the senior legal officers of more than eighty five FTSE 100 companies. The GC100 group was created in response to the increasing volume and complexity of domestic and international law and regulation which impacts on UK listed companies. The group was formed with the support of Practical Law Company which acts as its secretariat.\n\nThe main objectives of the GC100 are to:\n\n\nMembership of the GC100 is by invitation only.

{"id": "1838147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838147", "title": "Daniel M'Naghten", "text": "Daniel M'Naghten\n\nDaniel M'Naghten (sometimes spelled McNaughtan or McNaughton) (1813–3 May 1865) was a Scottish woodturner who assassinated English civil servant Edward Drummond while suffering from paranoid delusions. Through his trial and its aftermath, he has given his name to the legal test of criminal insanity in England and other common law jurisdictions known as the M'Naghten rules.\n\nMost of what is known about M'Naghten comes from evidence given at his trial and newspaper reports that appeared between his arrest and his trial. He was born in Scotland (probably Glasgow) in 1813, the illegitimate son of a Glasgow woodturner and landlord, also called Daniel M'Naghten. After the death of his mother Ada, M'Naghten went to live with his father's family and became an apprentice and later a journeyman at his father's workshop in Stockwell Street, Glasgow. When his father decided not to offer him a partnership, M'Naghten left the business and, after a three-year career as an actor, returned to Glasgow in 1835 to set up his own woodturning workshop.\n\nFor the next five years, he ran a successful woodturning business, first in Turners Court and then in Stockwell Street. He was sober and industrious, and by living frugally was able to save a considerable sum of money. In his spare time, he attended the Glasgow Mechanics' Institute and the Athenaeum Debating Society, walked and read. He taught himself French so that he could read La Rochefoucauld. His political views were radical, and he employed the Chartist Abram Duncan in his workshop.\n\nIn December 1840, M'Naghten sold his business and spent the next two years in London and Glasgow, with a brief trip to France. In the summer of 1842, he attended lectures on anatomy in Glasgow, but otherwise it is not known what he did with his time. Whilst in Glasgow in 1841, he complained to various people, including his father, the Glasgow commissioner of police and an MP, that he was being persecuted by the Tories and followed by their spies. No-one took him seriously, believing him to be deluded.\n\nIn January 1843, M'Naghten was noticed acting suspiciously around Whitehall in London. On the afternoon of 20 January, the Prime Minister's private secretary, civil servant Edward Drummond, was walking towards Downing Street from Charing Cross when M'Naghten approached him from behind, drew a pistol and fired at point-blank range into his back. M'Naghten was overpowered by a police constable before he could fire a second pistol. It is generally thought, although the evidence is not conclusive, that M'Naghten was under the impression that he had shot Prime Minister Robert Peel.\n\nAt first it was thought that Drummond's wound was not serious. He managed to walk away, the bullet was removed and the first newspaper reports were optimistic: \"The ball has been extracted. No vital part is injured, and [surgeons] Mr Guthrie and Mr Bransby Cooper have every reason to believe that Mr. Drummond is doing very well.\" But complications set in and, in spite of (or possibly because of; see below) the surgeons' bleeding and leeching, Drummond died five days later.\n\nM'Naghten appeared at the Bow Street magistrates' court the morning after the assassination attempt. He made a brief statement in which he described how persecution by the Tories had driven him to act: \"The Tories in my native city have compelled me to do this. They follow, persecute me wherever I go, and have entirely destroyed my peace of mind... It can be proved by evidence. That is all I have to say.\" It was indeed all he had to say. He never spoke about the assassination again (apart from a dozen words when asked to plead guilty or not guilty at arraignment).\n\nWhen M'Naghten was arrested, a bank receipt for £750 was found on him. His father successfully applied to the court to have the money released to finance his defence, and for the case to be adjourned for evidence relating to M'Naghten's state of mind to be gathered. A date was set for Friday 3 March. The speed and efficiency with which M'Naghten's defence was organised suggests that a number of powerful people in law and medicine were waiting for an opportunity to bring about changes in the law on criminal insanity.\n\nM'Naghten's trial for the \"wilful murder of Mr Drummond\" took place at the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey, Thursday and Friday, 2–3 March 1843, before Chief Justice Tindal, Justice Williams and Justice Coleridge. When asked to plead guilty or not guilty, M'Naghten had said \"I was driven to desperation by persecution\" and, when pressed, \"I am guilty of firing\", which was taken as a not guilty plea. M'Naghten's defence team was led by one of London's best-known barristers, Alexander Cockburn. The case was prosecuted by the solicitor-general, Sir William Follett (the attorney-general being busy in Lancaster prosecuting Feargus O'Connor and 57 other Chartists following the plug riots).\n\nBoth prosecution and defence based their cases on what constituted a legal defence of insanity. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten suffered from delusions of persecution. The prosecution argued that, in spite of his \"partial insanity\", he was a responsible agent, capable of distinguishing right from wrong, and conscious that he was committing a crime. Witnesses, including his landlady and his anatomy lecturer, were produced to testify that he appeared generally sane. Cockburn opened his defence by acknowledging that there were difficulties in the practical application of the principle of English law that held an insane person exempt from legal responsibility and legal punishment. He went on to say that M'Naghten's delusions had led to a breakdown of moral sense and loss of self-control, which, according to medical experts, had left him in a state where he was no longer a \"reasonable and responsible being\". He quoted extensively from Scottish jurist Baron Hume and American psychiatrist Isaac Ray. Witnesses were produced from Glasgow to give evidence about M'Naghten's odd behaviour and complaints of persecution. The defence then called medical witnesses, including Dr Edward Monro, Sir Alexander Morison and Dr Forbes Winslow, who testified that M'Naghten's delusions had deprived him of \"all restraint over his actions\". When the prosecution declined to produce any medical witnesses to counter this evidence, the trial was halted. Follet then made a brief, apologetic closing speech which he concluded with the words \"I cannot press for a verdict against the prisoner\". Chief Justice Tindal, in his summing up, stressed that the medical evidence was all on one side and reminded the jury that if they found the prisoner not guilty on the ground of insanity, proper care would be taken of him. The jury, without retiring, duly returned a verdict of not guilty on the ground of insanity.\n\nAfter his acquittal M'Naghten was transferred from Newgate Prison to the State Criminal Lunatic Asylum at Bethlem Hospital under the 1800 Act for the Safe Custody of Insane Persons charged with Offences. His admission papers describe him in the following words: \"Imagines the Tories are his enemies, shy and retiring in his manner.\" Apart from one hunger strike, which ended with force-feeding, McNaghten's 21 years at Bethlem appear to have been uneventful. Although no regular employment was provided for the men on the criminal wing of Bethlem, they were encouraged to keep themselves occupied with activities such as painting, drawing, knitting, board games, reading and musical instruments, and also did carpentry and decorating for the hospital.\n\nIn 1864, M'Naghten was transferred to the newly opened Broadmoor Asylum, where his admission papers describe him as: \"A native of Glasgow, an intelligent man\" and record how, when asked if he thinks he must have been out of his mind when he shot Edward Drummond, he answers: \"Such was the Verdict – the opinion of the Jury after hearing the Evidence.\" During his later years at Bethlem, he had been classified as an \"imbecile.\" He developed diabetes and heart problems in Bethlem; by the time he was transferred to Broadmoor, his health was declining, and he died on 3 May 1865.\n\nIn 1843, a surgeon who was opposed to blood-letting published an anonymous pamphlet claiming that Drummond was killed not by M'Naghten's shot, but by the medical treatment he received afterwards. He said that a gunshot wound of the type sustained by Drummond was not necessarily fatal and criticised Drummond's doctors for their hasty removal of the bullet and repeated blood-lettings.\n\nIn his book \"Knowing Right From Wrong\", Richard Moran, professor of sociology at Mount Holyoke College, argues that there are aspects of M'Naghten's case which have never been fully explained. He doubts that the money found on M'Naghten at the time of his arrest – £750 (currently worth £) – could have come entirely from his woodturning business, and points out that M'Naghten's political activity and the possibility that there may have been an element of truth to his complaints of persecution were ignored by the court. More recently, he has said that new evidence suggests that M'Naghten was a \"political activist who was financed to assassinate the prime minister\" and who subsequently feigned insanity.\n\nThe verdict in M'Naghten's trial provoked an outcry in the press and Parliament. Queen Victoria, who had been the target of assassination attempts, wrote to the prime minister expressing her concern at the verdict, and the House of Lords revived an ancient right to put questions to judges. Five questions relating to crimes committed by individuals with delusions were put to the 12 judges of the Court of Common Pleas. Chief Justice Tindal delivered the answers of 11 judges (Mr Justice Maule dissented in part) to the House of Lords on 19 June 1843. The answer to one of the questions became enshrined in law as the M'Naghten Rules and stated:\nTo establish a defence on the ground of insanity it must be clearly proved, that, at the time of committing the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.\nThe rules dominated the law on criminal responsibility in England and Wales, the United States and many countries throughout the British Commonwealth for over 100 years. In England and Wales, the defence of insanity to which the rules apply was largely superseded, in cases of murder, by the Scottish concept of diminished responsibility following the passage of the Homicide Act 1957.\nM'Naghten's defence had successfully argued that he was not legally responsible for an act that arose from a delusion; the rules represented a step backwards to the traditional 'knowing right from wrong' test of criminal insanity. Had the rules been applied in M'Naghten's own case, the verdict might have been different.\nOne of M'Naghten's younger half-brothers, Thomas McNaughtan, a doctor, became mayor of Blackpool and was a magistrate.\n\nThere is disagreement over how M'Naghten's name should be spelt (Mc or M' at the beginning, au or a in the middle, a, e, o or u at the end). M'Naghten is favoured in both English and American law reports, although the original trial report used M'Naughton; Bethlem and Broadmoor records use McNaughton and McNaughten. In a 1981 book about the case, Richard Moran, Professor of Criminology at Mount Holyoke College, uses the spelling McNaughtan, arguing that this was the family spelling. Until 1981, there was only one known signature: that which M'Naghten affixed to a sworn statement given before the magistrate at Bow Street during his arraignment. This signature, preserved in the Metropolitan Police File at the Public Records Office in Chancery Lane, London, first came to the attention of legal scholars in 1956. According to an authority at the British Museum this signature was spelt McNaughtun. Since this spelling did not conform to any of those in popular use, it did not help to resolve the controversy.\n\nMoran discovered a second signature during his research. On the front page of the \"Scotch Reformers Gazette\", supplementary edition for 4 March 1843, there appeared an artist's sketch of Daniel M'Naghten standing in the dock at Old Bailey, accompanied by an engraving of his signature. This signature revealed that the apparent u in the Bow Street signature was actually an a. It also indicated that the apostrophe was used by printers to signify a small letter c placed above the line, since the \"Scotch Reformers Gazette\", in the article accompanying the sketch and signature, used an inverted apostrophe to resemble more closely the letter c. The spelling \"McNaughtan\" was confirmed in the Glasgow Postal Directory for the years 1835 to 1844. While the Victorians were not always consistent in the way they spelled their names, even in official documents, several signatures of M'Naghten's father, uncovered while examining financial records at the Bank of Scotland, indicate that the \"McNaughtan\" spelling was the one used by the family.\n\n\n"}

It represents a long-term commitment to infrastructure delivery in South East Queensland. In mid-2011, then Premier Anna Bligh announced the plan would be incorporated into a statewide infrastructure plan called the Queensland Infrastructure Plan.\n\nSEQIPP was first released in 2005 and is updated annually. It sets timeframes and budgets to ensure infrastructure is delivered to support the region’s growth.\n\nIn 2010, the plan identifies about $134 billion in estimated infrastructure investment, which is expected to support about 930,000 jobs through to 2031:\n\n\nAn average of $37,000 per person in SEQ is estimated to be invested in infrastructure across South East Queensland to 2031.\n\nIn 2011, SEQIPP will become a statewide document, the Queensland Infrastructure Plan, which will clearly link infrastructure delivery with population growth and economic development priorities.\n\nIt will also be realigned to more effectively link to Queensland Growth Management Summit outcomes including regionalisation and feedback from local governments on dwelling targets.\n\nDelivery of SEQIPP is a clear demonstration of Growth Management Queensland (GMQ) delivering outcomes for Queenslanders.\n\nMajor road project that have been completed include the Tugun Bypass, Clem Jones Tunnel, Gateway Motorway Upgrade and the Hale Street Link, while work continues on the Airport Link. Public transport projects covered by the plan include the Northern Busway, Boggo Road Busway and the Eastern Busway. Track duplication between Corinda railway station and Darra railway station has been completed.\n\nThe Western Corridor Recycled Water Project and Southern Regional Water Pipeline were two water projects identified in the plan. The Traveston Crossing Dam was part of the plan, however the Federal Government rejected the project on environmental grounds.\n\n\n"}

The inhabitants became Roman citizens after 195 BC, and the place later became a municipium. It lay just above the Via Latina and, being a strong place, served for the detention of hostages.\n\nFrom 1198 to 1557 it was the seat of the Papal rectorate of Campagna and Marittima province.\n\nStrong in textiles (linen and embroidery) and handicraft (clay bricks from Fornaci Giorgi), after World War II Ferentino experienced a heavy industrial growth, mainly in pharmaceuticals.\n\nFerentino still possesses remains of ancient fortifications. The lower portion of the outer walls, which probably did not stand free, is built of roughly hewn blocks of a limestone which naturally splits into horizontal layers; above this in places is walling of rectangular blocks of tuff. Two gates, the \"Porta Maggiore\", a double gate constructed entirely of rectangular blocks of tuff, and the \"Porta Sanguinaria\" (with an arch with tuff voussoirs), are preserved. Outside this gate, the testament of Aulus Quinctilius Priscus inscribed in the rock.\n\nThe highest part of the town, the acropolis (2nd-1st centuries BC), is fortified also; it has massive retaining walls similar to those of the lower town. At the eastern corner, under the present episcopal palace, the construction is somewhat more careful. A projecting rectangular terrace has been erected, supported by walls of quadrilateral blocks of limestone arranged almost horizontally; while upon the level thus formed a building of rectangular blocks of local travertine was raised. The projecting cornice of this building bears two inscriptions of the period of Sulla, recording its construction by two censors (local officials); and in the interior, which contains several chambers, there is an inscription of the same censors over one of the doors, and another over a smaller external aide door. The windows lighting these chambers come immediately above the cornice, and the wall continues above them again. The whole of this construction probably belongs to one period.\nThe Cathedral of Sts John and Paul occupies a part of the level top of the ancient acropolis; it was reconstructed on the site of an older church in 1099–1118; the interior was modernized in 1693, but was restored to its original form in 1902. It contains a fine ciborium in the Cosmatesque style and a 12th-century mosaic pavement.\n\nThe Gothic church of \"Santa Maria Maggiore\", in the lower town (13th-14th century), has a very fine exterior; the interior, the plan of which is a perfect rectangle, has been spoiled by restoration. Other religious edifices include the Benedictine church of \"San Valentino\" (mostly remade after World War II, but still including 13th-century frescoes) and the Romanesque monastery of \"Sant'Antonio Abate\", which housed the remains of Pope Celestine V until 1327. The latter's heart is preserved in the small convent church of the Clarisse (17th century).\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

Named official hostess of Fairbanks and honorary hostess of Alaska, McGown was featured in an article in \"Reader's Digest\" and a broadcast of the popular biographical television program \"This Is Your Life\", and was the basis for the character Bridie Ballantyne in the 1958 novel \"Ice Palace\" and its 1960 film adaptation. She died in 1972 in a fire in the Nordale Hotel, where she had lived the last 28 years of her life.\n\nEva Montgomery was born on June 23, 1883 in Antrim, Ireland. Little is known about her early life other than that she was director of a choir in Belfast in the early 1900s.\n\nIn 1914, when she was 31, she came to the United States to marry Arthur Louis McGown, the part-owner of the Model Cafe in Fairbanks, Alaska. Her travel from Belfast to Fairbanks included a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean on what she later described as \"a filthy boat\" and a cross-country journey by train to Seattle, Washington, where she boarded a steamer bound for Valdez, Alaska, followed by over a month's winter travel by horse-drawn sleigh and dogsled to Fairbanks, staying at roadhouses along the way. \"There were rough and tough men on the trail\", she later remembered. \"But never a cursing word did they say in my hearing. They gave me hot bricks for my feet and wrapped furs around me.\" She arrived in Fairbanks on February 26, 1914 and was married to Arthur McGown the same evening.\n\nArthur became ill five years into their marriage and remained an invalid for the remainder of his life. He died in 1930 of a bone tumor.\n\nSoon after, Eva left the cabin where she had lived with her husband and moved into Room 207 of the Nordale Hotel on Second Avenue in Fairbanks, where she lived for the rest of her life. She supported herself by selling magazines and taking odd jobs, and occupied herself as a hospital visitor and by visiting lonely women newly arrived in Alaska, doing what she could to make them feel welcome.\n\nWhen World War II arrived, her services as a greeter with an intricate knowledge of available rooms in Fairbanks became vital, and the Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce put her on the payroll for $75 per month to help military wives, construction workers, and others find a place to stay. She later became a city employee for $110 per month. \"It was said that Eva carried an inventory in her head of all the spare bedrooms in Fairbanks\", wrote Stanton Patty. \"She also arranged for beds to be set up in church basements and auditoriums — sometimes even at the city jail.\" McGown's work was accomplished from a desk in the corner of the Nordale Hotel lobby.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1951, McGown helped an estimated 50,000 new arrivals, construction workers, students, and visitors find a place to stay.\n\nMcGown's fame spread far beyond Fairbanks. In 1951, she was the subject of an article in \"Reader's Digest\" and on April 22, 1953, she was featured on a broadcast of the biographical television show \"This Is Your Life\" with host Ralph Edwards. Her TV appearance was included as part of the first broadcast of Fairbanks television station KFAR-TV in early 1955. In her 1958 novel about Alaska, \"Ice Palace\", Edna Ferber based the character of Bridie Ballantyne, official greeter of the fictional town of Baranof, on McGown;, the part was played by Carolyn Jones in the 1960 film adaptation of the novel.\n\nMcGown belonged to the Women Pioneers, Eastern Star, Salvation Army, Soroptimists, Fort Wainwright and Eielson Officers' Women's Clubs. She was a member of St. Matthew's Episcopal Church, where she played the organ and led the choir. She continued to play the organ until she developed arthritis in her hands, but afterward still sang with her soprano voice.\n\nIn one of Alaska's deadlier hotel fires, the Nordale Hotel caught fire on February 22, 1972, killing four people and destroying the hotel. Among the four who died in the blaze was McGown, then 88. One of the items recovered from the hotel safe after the fire was a small box belonging to her, in which was contained a piece of dried sod from Ireland. An Alaska Supreme Court decision later ruled that the City of Fairbanks had a duty to protect hotel occupants through fire inspections.\n\nMcGown was the first woman to win the Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce distinguished-service award.\n\nIn 1953, territorial governor B. Frank Heintzleman issued a proclamation naming McGown Alaska's honorary hostess.\n\nIn 1971 the University of Alaska Fairbanks dedicated a music rehearsal hall in McGown's honor. The Eva McGown Music Room is located in the Fine Arts Complex. It is designed specifically for choral practice and is equipped with risers for group rehearsal.\n\nA stained glass window designed by Helen L. Atkinson and made by Debbie Mathews from over 500 pieces of glass was created for St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in 1999. The window commemorates Eva McGown and the St. Matthew's choir of the early 1900s and depicts McGown playing the organ.\n"}

The album was originally to be titled \"Say You, Say Me\", after the Academy Award-winning track of the same name, but it was renamed to a different track's title after Richie rewrote several songs on the album. The album was released to generally positive reviews and it made No. 1 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 4 million copies. Following this album's release, Richie went on a long hiatus, not releasing an album of entirely new material for another ten years.\n\nLionel Richie had risen to prominence as a member of the Commodores during the late 1970s, but after tensions arose in the band, he left in 1982. His first two solo albums, \"Lionel Richie\" (1982) and \"Can't Slow Down\" (1983), were runaway successes: \"Lionel Richie\" sold 4 million copies, while \"Can't Slow Down\" sold 10 million copies, and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nRecording of the songs later used on \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" began in 1985. The track \"Say You, Say Me\" was used in that year's film \"White Nights\" for which it had won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Work on the album was done while Richie was finalizing his work with \"We Are the World\".\n\nDuring early production, the album was intended to be titled \"Say You, Say Me\" and released in December 1985. However, Richie found that he did not \"want to do those songs\" owing to the social conditions he saw, and as such he began rewriting it \"to express what [he] felt the world was boxing itself into\". Ultimately, the album's title was changed to \"Dancing on the Ceiling\", as the titular song was Richie's next single. Recording for the album took over a year and a half, and Richie later stated that he tried to include a mixture of sounds.\n\nAll tracks produced by Lionel Richie and James Anthony Carmichael, except \"Night Train (Smooth Alligator)\" produced by Narada Michael Walden.\n\"Dancing on the Ceiling\" was released on August 5, 1986. The album sold 4 million copies in the US and it became the first album to be simultaneously certified silver, gold, platinum, and double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America since the institution established double platinum in 1984. To promote the album Richie went on an Outrageous 40-city concert tour, entitled \"Outrageous\". The first concert was in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n\"Dancing on the Ceiling\" peaked at No. 1 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 200. The title track was the second biggest single from the album, reaching No. 2 in the US and No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart, falling behind \"Say You, Say Me\" earlier performance. Other Top 10 singles from the album include \"Love Will Conquer All\" (US No. 9, UK No. 45) and \"Ballerina Girl\" (US No. 7, UK No. 17). Meanwhile, \"Deep River Woman\" reached No. 10 on \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart.\n\n\"Dancing on the Ceiling\" has generally received positive reviews. Anthony Decurtis, reviewing in \"Rolling Stone\", gave the album a positive review, writing that it \"sets an impressive standard for mainstream pop craft\", encompassing Richie's \"finest qualities\". He especially praised the track \"Say You, Say Me\", but found \"Ballerina Girl\" a \"virtual anthology of Richie's worst saccharine excesses\".\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau ranked the album a B+. He found that it provided \"lulling, almost mantralike entertainment\" with \"a knack for tune that puts [Richie] over the fine line between lulling and boring\". His criticism centered on \"Ballerina\" for its mawkishness and lack of interest in some of the faster songs. Meanwhile, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic retrospectively gave \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" four out of five stars, summarizing that, overall, the album was \"a solid, enjoyable affair\". He considered, however, it a \"comedown\" after Richie's previous albums, with its songs generally longer than necessary and the lyrics mixing \"silliness ... and sappiness\".\n\nFollowing the success of \"Dancing on the Ceiling\", Richie withdrew almost entirely from the music industry for six years, a move which Steve Huey of AllMusic suggests was \"quitting while he was ahead\". He released a compilation album – with some new material – entitled \"Back to Front\" in 1992, with his first all-new release, \"Louder Than Words\", following in 1996. , none of his successive albums have been as successful as \"Lionel Richie\", \"Can't Slow Down\", and \"Dancing on the Ceiling\". A remastered edition of \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" was released in 2003, featuring four bonus tracks.\n\n\n\n"}

He enjoyed equal popularity with the poet and calligrapher Lu Qian in the early Qing Dynasty. They were called \"Two Ban of the World\" (), (Gong Xian: Banqian; Lu Qian, Banyin).\n\nPrimarily a landscape painter, mountains were the subject of most of Gong Xian's paintings. Willows are also a common theme in his work.\n\nGong Xian was a scholar loyal to the fallen Ming Dynasty. In the early years, he participated in the reunification activities. During the war in the late Ming Dynasty, he was forced to flee to save his life and drifted away. He spent many years at Yangzhou in exile, during which he continued to author anti-Qing works, and develop his characteristic \"light Gong\" and \"dark Gong\" styles.\n\nGong Xian was also one of the literati and known for his work with prose and poetry.

Heinlein. It describes the US effort to build a nuclear weapon in order to end the ongoing World War II, and its dystopian consequences to the nation and the world.\n\nThe story was first published in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" magazine, with illustrations by Frank Kramer. In November 1940, \"Astounding\" editor John W. Campbell had suggested that Heinlein write a story about the use of radioactive dust as a weapon, proposing a detailed scenario. Heinlein discarded Campbell's scenario, and wrote a story he called \"Foreign Policy\", submitting it to Campbell in December 1940 with the comment \"I turned the original idea upside down, inside out, shook it, and have turned out an entirely different story\". Campbell quickly accepted the piece, changing the title to \"Solution Unsatisfactory\"; it appeared in the May 1941 issue, under Heinlein's \"Anson MacDonald\" pseudonym. \"Universe\" appeared in the same issue under Heinlein's name.\n\nThe story is collected in \"The Worlds of Robert A. Heinlein\" in 1966, \"Expanded Universe\" in 1980, and the Science Fiction Book Club omnibus \"\" in 2005. An Italian translation appeared in 1967 and a German translation in 1972.\n\nJohn DeFries, the narrator, is the campaign manager of Clyde C. Manning, a freshman congressman and military veteran who received a medical discharge for a heart condition. DeFries chose the congressman because \"he was liberal [but] was tough-minded\" enough to attract conservative support. In 1941 Manning is recalled to active duty with the rank of Colonel, and takes deFries as his adjutant. He is appointed to head a secret, top-priority project with unlimited funding, with the aim of developing a nuclear weapon before the Nazis do so. The project makes little progress into 1944. World War II is a stalemate; the British and Germans continue to bomb each other's cities, while the United States, Soviet Union (renamed \"The Eurasian Union\"), and Japan stay out.\n\nManning hears of fish dying in Chesapeake Bay where the by-products of Dr. Estelle Karst's research into artificial radioactive materials are being dumped. She was a laboratory assistant of Otto Hahn, the first man to characterize induced fission in uranium, and fled Germany \"to escape a pogrom\". Karst is working on radioactive materials for medical uses, but Manning sees its potential as a radiological weapon. Over Karst's objections, by Christmas 1944 the United States is in possession of nearly 10,000 \"units\" of radioactive dust, a \"unit\" being defined as the quantity which \"would take care of a thousand men, at normal dispersion\"; enough to kill the entire population of a large city such as Berlin.\n\nManning seriously considers ordering that all people aware of the secret, including himself, be put to death and all records destroyed. He rejects that course because someone else, perhaps German or Russian, is certain to rediscover it. Instead, Manning in 1945 convinces the President to use the dust against Germany. Since America is officially not in the war, the Americans give the dust to Britain but at the price of the British accepting a complete US ascendancy in the postwar world.\n\nThe Americans warn the Germans by demonstrating what the dust does to cattle, dropping leaflets over Germany, and having the President speak to the Führer, but the Germans refuse to surrender. RAF bombers scatter the dust over Berlin and leave no survivors. The Nazi regime collapses and the new government surrenders. Karst commits suicide by exposing herself to the dust.\n\nManning warns the Cabinet of the great dangers of the new situation, introducing the concepts of the nuclear arms race, mutual assured destruction, and second strike capability. He convinces the President and Cabinet that the only solution is to use the American nuclear monopoly while it still exists. Any other world power, such as the Eurasian Union, might create such dust and bomb the United States within weeks. Still a congressman, Manning convinces the President that there is no time to get Congressional approval and that the Constitution must be bypassed.\n\nThe United States issues a \"Peace Proclamation\" which essentially demands the immediate and unconditional surrender of the rest of the world. All other states are required to disarm and to hand over all long-range civilian and military aircraft, since any airplane can spread the dust. The prohibition on commercial airlines applies to America also; the Army will manage any required civilian air travel. Most of the world complies.\n\nThe Eurasians did invent the dust for themselves as Manning had warned, and launch a surprise attack. The American victory in the \"Four-Day War\" owes much to Manning, who had arranged for Congress and President to be outside Washington ahead of the attack, and false rumors of plague to empty New York; nonetheless, 800,000 are killed in Manhattan alone. Eurasian documents completely vindicate Manning's unconstitutional policies; had the President waited for congressional approval, America would have lost the war.\n\nManning becomes lifetime head of the new Peace Patrol, with a worldwide monopoly over the radioactive dust and the aircraft which can deliver it. He opens schools for the indoctrination of cadet patrolmen from any race, color, or nationality. They will patrol the sky and \"guard the peace\" of any country but their own, and would be forbidden to return to their original country for the entire duration of their service; \"a deliberately expatriated band of Janizaries, with an obligation only to the Commission and the race, and welded together with a carefully nurtured \"esprit de corps\".\"\n\nManning does not have time to complete his original plans for the Patrol. In 1951, the President dies in a plane crash; his isolationist successor demands Manning's resignation and intends to dismantle the Patrol. As Manning argues with the President, planes loaded with radioactive dust and piloted by non-Americans appear overhead. Manning is willing to kill himself and treat the capital of the United States as he would treat any other place which he perceives a \"threat to world peace\". He wins the standoff and becomes the undisputed military dictator of the world. DeFries (himself dying from radiation poisoning) doubts that Manning, now the most-hated man on Earth, can succeed in making the Patrol self-perpetuating and trustworthy. There is no way of knowing how long Manning will live, given his weak heart. The narrator concludes:\n\nThough it deals not with fission bombs, but rather with a radioisotope dust weapon, \"Solution Unsatisfactory\" accurately predicted many aspects of the development of nuclear arms and the dilemmas they pose, a year before President Roosevelt authorized the Manhattan Project led by General Leslie Groves. Scientific advisors wrote a 1943 memo to Groves entitled \"Use of Radioactive Materials as a Military Weapon\":\nWhile not part of Heinlein's \"Future History\", the story also marks the first appearance of a \"Patrol\" in Heinlein's works. The concept of a distinct order of pilots totally dedicated to preserving the peace reappears in Heinlein's later works, including the short story \"The Long Watch\". The juvenile \"Space Cadet\" describes the training and indoctrination of Patrol cadets. Cadets are taught not to ask about another's country or planet of origin, and to admire and seek to emulate Rivera, a legendary Patrolman who ordered the nuclear bombing of his own hometown and died himself in the blast.\n\n\"Solution Unsatisfactory\" marked the beginning of Heinlein's concern with nuclear weapons. After World War II, Heinlein believed that a nuclear arms race was an urgent problem. He wrote several works on nuclear warfare in the mid-1940s, such as \"The Last Days of the United States\", \"How to be a Survivor\", and \"Pie from the Sky\" but, except for \"Back of the Moon,\" they were rejected by publishers. Heinlein wrote: In 1980, he published them in \"Expanded Universe\" along with \"Solution Unsatisfactory\".\n\nThe 1984 novel \"The Peace War\" by Vernor Vinge features a \"Peace Authority\" created when military research scientists develop a device called a \"bobbler\" and use it to take over the world and enforce world peace in a very similar fashion.\n\n"}
{"id": "1838227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838227", "title": "Radio jamming", "text": "Radio jamming\n\nRadio jamming is the deliberate jamming, blocking or interference with authorized wireless communications. In the United States, radio jamming devices (known as \"jammers\") are illegal and their use can result in large fines.\n\nIn some cases jammers work by the transmission of radio signals that disrupt communications by decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nThe concept can be used in wireless data networks to disrupt information flow. It is a common form of censorship in totalitarian countries, in order to prevent foreign radio stations in border areas from reaching the country.\n\nJamming is usually distinguished from interference that can occur due to device malfunctions or other accidental circumstances. Devices that simply cause interference are regulated differently. Unintentional \"jamming\" occurs when an operator transmits on a busy frequency without first checking whether it is in use, or without being able to hear stations using the frequency. Another form of unintentional jamming occurs when equipment accidentally radiates a signal, such as a cable television plant that accidentally emits on an aircraft emergency frequency.\n\nOriginally the terms were used interchangeably but nowadays most radio users use the term \"jamming\" to describe the \"deliberate\" use of radio noise or signals in an attempt to disrupt communications (or prevent listening to broadcasts) whereas the term \"interference\" is used to describe \"unintentional\" forms of disruption (which are far more common). However, the distinction is still not universally applied. For inadvertent disruptions, see electromagnetic compatibility.\n\nIntentional communications jamming is usually aimed at radio signals to disrupt control of a battle. A transmitter, tuned to the same frequency as the opponents' receiving equipment and with the same type of modulation, can, with enough power, override any signal at the receiver. Digital wireless jamming for signals such as Bluetooth and WiFi is possible with very low power.\n\nThe most common types of this form of signal jamming are random noise, random pulse, stepped tones, warbler, random keyed modulated CW, tone, rotary, pulse, spark, recorded sounds, gulls, and sweep-through. These can be divided into two groups: obvious and subtle.\n\nObvious jamming is easy to detect because it can be heard on the receiving equipment. It usually is some type of noise, such as stepped tones (bagpipes), random-keyed code, pulses, music (often distorted), erratically warbling tones, highly distorted speech, random noise (hiss), and recorded sounds. Various combinations of these methods may be used, often accompanied by regular morse identification signal to enable individual transmitters to be identified in order to assess their effectiveness. For example, China, which used jamming extensively and still does, plays a loop of traditional Chinese music while it is jamming channels (cf. Attempted jamming of numbers stations).\n\nThe purpose of this type of jamming is to block reception of transmitted signals and to cause a nuisance to the receiving operator. One early Soviet attempt at jamming Western broadcasters used the noise from the diesel generator that was powering the jamming transmitter.\n\nSubtle jamming is jamming during which no sound is heard on the receiving equipment. The radio does not receive incoming signals; yet everything seems superficially normal to the operator. These are often technical attacks on modern equipment, such as \"squelch capture\". Thanks to the FM capture effect, frequency modulated broadcasts may be jammed, unnoticed, by a simple unmodulated carrier. The receiver locks on to the larger carrier signal, and hence will ignore the FM signal that carries the information.\n\nDigital signals use complex modulation techniques, such as QPSK. These signals are very robust in the presence of interfering signals. But the signal relies on hand shaking between the transmitter and receiver to identify and determine security settings and method of high-level transmission. If the jamming device sends initiation data packets, the receiver will begin its state machine to establish two-way data transmission. A jammer will loop back to the beginning instead of completing the handshake. This method jams the receiver in an infinite loop where it keeps trying to initiate a connection but never completes it, which effectively blocks all legitimate communication.\n\nBluetooth and other consumer radio protocols such as WiFi have built-in detectors, so that they transmit only when the channel is free. Simple continuous transmission on a given channel will continuously stop a transmitter transmitting, hence jamming the receiver from ever hearing from its intended transmitter. Other jammers work by analysing the packet headers and, depending on the source or destination, selectively transmitting over the end of the message, corrupting the packet.\n\n\nDuring World War II, ground radio operators would attempt to mislead pilots by false instructions in their own language, in what was more precisely a spoofing attack than jamming. Radar jamming is also important to disrupt use of radar used to guide an enemy's missiles or aircraft. Modern secure communication techniques use such methods as spread spectrum modulation to resist the deleterious effects of jamming.\n\nJamming of foreign radio broadcast stations has often been used in wartime (and during periods of tense international relations) to prevent or deter citizens from listening to broadcasts from enemy countries. However, such jamming is usually of limited effectiveness because the affected stations usually change frequencies, put on additional frequencies and/or increase transmission power.\n\nJamming has also occasionally been used by the governments of Germany (during World War II), Israel, Cuba, Iraq, Iran (during the Iran-Iraq War), China, North and South Korea and several Latin American countries, as well as by Ireland against pirate radio stations such as Radio Nova. The United Kingdom government used two coordinated, separately located transmitters to jam the offshore radio ship, Radio North Sea International off the coast of Britain in 1970.\n\nIn occupied Europe the Nazis attempted to jam broadcasts to the continent from the BBC and other allied stations. Along with increasing transmitter power and adding extra frequencies, attempts were made to counteract the jamming by dropping leaflets over cities instructing listeners to construct a directional loop aerial that would enable them to hear the stations through the jamming. In the Netherlands such aerials were nicknamed \"moffenzeef\" (English: \"kraut sieve\").\n\nSince the Soviet Union started jamming Western radio broadcasts to the Soviet Union in 1948 the primary targets have been the BBC External Broadcasting Services, Voice of America (VOA) and RFE/RL. Western nations had allowed jamming prior to World War II, but in the post-War era the Western view has been that jamming violates the freedom of information while the Soviet view has been that under the international law principle of national sovereignty jamming is an acceptable response to foreign radio broadcasts.\n\nDuring much of the Cold War, Soviet (and Eastern Bloc) jamming of some Western broadcasters led to a \"power race\" in which broadcasters and jammers alike repeatedly increased their transmission power, utilised highly directional antennas and added extra frequencies (known as \"barrage\" or \"frequency diversity\" broadcasting) to the already heavily overcrowded shortwave bands to such an extent that many broadcasters not directly targeted by the jammers (including pro-Soviet stations) suffered from the rising levels of noise and interference.\n\nThere were also periods when China and the Soviet Union jammed each other's programmes. The Soviet Union also jammed Albanian programmes at times.\n\nSome parts of the world were more impacted by these broadcasting practices than others\n\nMeanwhile, some listeners in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc devised ingenious methods (such as homemade directional loop antennas) to hear the Western stations through the noise. Because radio propagation on shortwave can be difficult to predict reliably, listeners sometimes found that there were days/times when the jamming was particularly ineffective because radio fading (due to atmospheric conditions) was affecting the jamming signals but favouring the broadcasts (a phenomenon sometimes dubbed \"twilight immunity\"). On other days of course the reverse was the case. There were also times when jamming transmitters were (temporarily) off air due to breakdowns or maintenance. The Soviets (and most of their Eastern bloc allies) used two types of jamming transmitter. Skywave jamming covered a large area but for the reasons described was of limited effectiveness. Groundwave jamming was more effective but only over a small area and was thus used only in/near major cities throughout the Eastern Bloc. Both types of jamming were less effective on higher shortwave frequencies (above 15 MHz); however, many radios in the Soviet Union didn't cover the higher bands. Skywave jamming was usually accompanied by morse signals in order to enable (coded) identification of the jamming station in order that Soviet monitoring posts could assess the effectiveness of each station.\n\nIn 1987 after decades of generally refusing to acknowledge that such jamming was even taking place the Soviets finally stopped jamming western broadcasts with the exception of RFE/RL which continued to be jammed for several months into 1988. Previously there had been periods when some individual Eastern bloc countries refrained from jamming Western broadcasts but this varied widely by time and country. In general outside of the Soviet Union itself Bulgaria was one of the most prolific operators of jamming transmitters in the Eastern bloc with East Germany the least.\n\nWhile western governments may have occasionally considered jamming broadcasts from Eastern Bloc stations, it was generally accepted that doing so would be a pointless exercise. Ownership of shortwave radios was less common in western countries than in the Soviet Union where, due to the vast physical size of the country, many domestic stations were relayed on shortwave as it was the only practical way to cover remote areas. Additionally, western governments were generally less afraid of intellectual competition from the Eastern Bloc.\n\nIn Francoist Spain the dictatorship jammed for decades Radio España Independiente, the radio station of the Communist Party of Spain which broadcast from Moscow (1941–1955) and Bucharest (1955–1977). It was the most important pirate radio in Spain and the regime considered it a threat, since it allowed its citizens to skip the censorship of the local media. Money and technological assistance for the jamming came from the United States.\n\nHowever, in Latin America there were instances of communist radio stations such as Radio Venceremos being jammed, allegedly by the CIA, while there were short lived instances where Britain jammed some Egyptian (during the Suez Crisis), Greek (prior to Cyprus gaining independence) and Rhodesian stations.\n\nIn 2002, China acquired standard short-wave radio-broadcasting equipment designed for general public radio-broadcasting and technical support from Thales Broadcast Multimedia, a former subsidiary of the French state-owned company Thales Group.\n\nDebates have been raised in Iran regarding the possible health hazards of satellite jamming. Iranian officials including the health minister have claimed that jamming has no health risk for humans. However, the minister of communication has recently admitted that satellite jamming has 'serious effects' and has called for identification of jamming stations so they can put a stop to this practice. The government has generally denied any involvement in jamming and claimed they are sent from unknown sources. According to some sources IRGC is the organization behind satellite jamming in Iran.\n\nThe Russian Armed Forces have, since the summer of 2015, begun using a multi-functional EW weapon system in Ukraine, known as Borisoglebsk 2. It is postulated that this system has defeated communications in parts of that country, including mobile telephony and GPS systems.\n\n\nRelevant legal instruments include the International Telecommunications Conventions (ITC) governing the apportionment of the world's radio frequency spectrum. Each ITC since 1947 has included a provision that radio stations can not result in harmful interference to radio services of other signatories. The United Nations does not have enforcement power over the terms which are not always followed by the signatories.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the earliest articulation of the principle of freedom of information claimed by Western states as permitting their broadcasts into the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nThe 1950 UN Resolution on Jamming concerns the application of the freedom of information principle to the specific matter of jamming. At around the same time freedom of information was applied retroactively under the Draft Convention on Freedom of Information, but was dropped from the General Assembly agenda in 1973.\n\nRadio jamming (or \"comm jamming\") is a common plot element in the Star Wars franchise. In \"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\", when the Rebel fleet approaches the Galactic Empire's force, believing themselves to be launching a surprise attack, General Lando Calrissian realizes the Empire is jamming their signals, and therefore know they are approaching.\n\n"}

His work on Vlad Dracula includes a series of bestselling books that he co-authored with his colleague Raymond T. McNally. Along with serving as Director of the East European Research Center at Boston College, Florescu was also a philanthropist and an adviser to Edward Kennedy on Balkan and Eastern European affairs. At the time of his death, Radu Florescu was considered the patriarch of the .\n\nFlorescu was born in Bucharest to an aristocratic , one of the oldest of the extant Romanian boyar families. He left Romania at the outbreak of World War II and moved to London, as his father, a pro-Allied diplomat who served under Romanian Minister Viorel Tilea to the United Kingdom, defied a recall order from the pro-Axis government of Ion Antonescu. In protest of Romania's new alliance with Nazi Germany, Florescu's father resigned his post and joined the Free Rumanian Committee in opposition to the fascist Antonescu regime. After leaving St. Edward's School, Oxford, Florescu received a scholarship to study history (BA, MA) at Christ Church, Oxford. He moved to Indiana University-Bloomington in the United States for his doctorate.\n\nWith one child, Nicholas, born in Austin, Texas, Radu Florescu moved east and began his academic career as a Professor of history at Boston College. In the Boston area, he will have 3 more children: John (1954), Radu (1961), and Alexandra (1963). At Boston College, he joined forces with Raymond T. McNally, and the two began their research on Vlad the Impaler. Then with McNally and Matei Cazacu, of the Paris Institut des Hautes Etudes, Florescu will go on to write six books on Vlad the Impaler's life. Alongside his work on Vlad the Impaler, Florescu would write seven more books on East European History and on the history of Romania such as \"The Struggle Against Russia in the Romanian principalities, 1821-1854\".\n\nRadu Florescu created a diplomatic bridge between the United States and Romania. He advised Edward Kennedy on matters of the Balkans, and also served as the press liaison for the White House during the state visit of President Richard Nixon in 1969 in Romania.\n\nIn 1986, Florescu became the Director of the East European Research Center at Boston College and remained in that position until his retirement in 2008. In that function, he organized symposiums on themes varying from the diffusion of Thracian culture in antiquity to the rise of antisemitism in interwar Romania.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2004, Florescu served as Honorary Consul for New England by the Romanian Foreign Ministry, the first person to hold such a position in the United States. His first job as honorary consul was to oversee voting by Boston-area Romanian citizens in one of the first democratic Romanian elections since the Revolution of 1989. After the Revolution of 1989, he also organized visits of Romanian presidents, and members of the Romanian Royal House to Harvard University, The John F. Kennedy library and Boston City Hall. \nHe was Emeritus Honorary Consul.\nIn his retirement from France and Poiana Brasov, Professor Florescu, repurposed the East European Research Centre to create an annual scholarship for several gifted Romanian teenagers to study in the Boston area during summer months. These scholarships still continue to this day. His son, John M. Florescu, serves on the board of Educational Enrichment for Romanian Children.\n\nUpon his death, the Romanian royal family released a statement of condolences and recognition for Florescu's work.\n\nIn his bestseller \"In Search of Dracula\" (1972), co-authored with Raymond T. McNally, he claimed that the brutal Vlad III, voivod of the principality of Wallachia, was the inspiration for Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\". Vlad was a member of the House of Drăculești, and Stoker's novel took place in real locations such as Transylvania and Tihuta Pass, including even correct rail lines. For this reason, Florescu concluded that the main character must also be inspired by facts. Vlad Țepeș, known for the slaughter of many Saxons and Ottomans, with a penchant for impaling his enemies on stakes, was the logical choice as the model for Dracula. The book was translated into 15 languages and boosted the Romanian tourism industry as young Westerners flocked to Romania to trace the footsteps of the historical Dracula.\n\nFlorescu also wrote about literary creations like Frankenstein with \"In Search of Frankenstein\" (1975) and the Pied Piper of Hamelin with \"In Search of the Pied Piper\" (2005). In the former, Florescu advocated the theory that the German theologian, alchemist, anatomist, and physician Johann Konrad Dippel was the inspiration for Mary Shelley's novel \"Frankenstein\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838237", "title": "Radar jamming and deception", "text": "Radar jamming and deception\n\nRadar jamming and deception is a form of electronic countermeasures that intentionally sends out radio frequency signals to interfere with the operation of radar by saturating its receiver with noise or false information. Concepts that blanket the radar with signals so its display cannot be read are normally known as jamming, while systems that produce confusing or contradictory signals are known as deception, but it is also common for all such systems to be referred to as jamming.\n\nThere are two general classes of radar jamming, mechanical and electronic. Mechanical jamming entails reflecting enemy radio signals in various ways to provide false or misleading target signals to the radar operator. Electronic jamming works by transmitting additional radio signals towards enemy receivers, making it difficult to detect real target signals, or take advantage of known behaviors of automated systems like radar lock-on to confuse the system.\n\nVarious counter-countermeasures can sometimes help radar operators maintain target detection despite jamming.\n\nMechanical jamming is caused by devices that reflect or re-reflect radar energy back to the radar to produce false target returns on the operator's scope. Mechanical jamming devices include chaff, corner reflectors, and decoys.\n\n\nElectronic jamming is a form of electronic warfare where jammers radiate interfering signals toward an enemy's radar, blocking the receiver with highly concentrated energy signals. The two main technique styles are noise techniques and repeater techniques. The three types of noise jamming are spot, sweep, and barrage.\n\n\nThe burn-through range is the distance from the radar at which the jamming is ineffective. When a target is within this range, the radar receives an adequate target skin return to track it. The burn through range is a function of the target RCS (Radar cross-section), jamming ERP (Effective radiated power), the radars ERP and required J/S (for the jamming to be effective).\n\nIn some cases, jamming of either type may be caused by friendly sources. Inadvertent mechanical jamming is fairly common because it is indiscriminate and affects any nearby radars, hostile or not. Electronic jamming can also be inadvertently caused by friendly sources, usually powerful EW platforms operating within range of the affected radar.\n\n\nFor protective jamming, a small RCS of the protected aircraft improve the jamming efficiency (higher J/S). A lower RCS also reduce the \"burn-through\" range. \nStealth technologies like radar-absorbent materials can be used to reduce the return of a target.\n\nWhile not usually caused by the enemy, interference can greatly impede the ability of an operator to track. Interference occurs when two radars in relatively close proximity (how close they need to be depends on the power of the radars) are operating on the same frequency. This will cause \"running rabbits\", a visual phenomenon that can severely clutter up a radar display scope with useless data. Interference is not that common between ground radars, however, because they are not usually placed close enough together. It is more likely that some sort of airborne radar system is inadvertently causing the interference—especially when two or more countries are involved.\n\nThe interference between airborne radars referred to above can sometimes (usually) be eliminated by frequency-shifting the transmitter(s).\n\nThe other interference often experienced is between the aircraft's own electronic transmitters, i.e. transponders, being picked up by its radar. This interference is eliminated by suppressing the radar's reception for the duration of the transponder's transmission. Instead of \"bright-light\" rabbits across the display, one would observe very small black dots. Because the external radar causing the transponder to respond is generally not synchronised with your own radar (i.e. different PRFs [pulse repetition frequency]), these black dots appear randomly across the display and the operator sees through and around them. The returning image may be much larger than the \"dot\" or \"hole\", as it has become known, anyway. Keeping the transponder's pulse widths very narrow and mode of operation (single pulse rather than multi-pulse) becomes a crucial factor.\n\nThe external radar could, in theory, come from an aircraft flying alongside your own, or from space. Another factor often overlooked is to reduce the sensitivity of one's own transponder to external radars; i.e., ensure that the transponder's threshold is high. In this way it will only respond to nearby radars—which, after all, should be friendly.\n\nOne should also reduce the power output of the transponder in like manner.\n\nJamming radar for the purpose of defeating police radar guns is simpler than military-grade radar jamming. The laws about jamming police radars vary by jurisdiction.\n\nThe jamming of bat sonar by certain tiger moth species has recently been confirmed. This can be seen as nature's equivalent of radar jamming.\n\n"}

Brill Company manufactured streetcars, interurban coaches, motor buses, trolleybuses and railroad cars in the United States for almost ninety years; it was the longest lasting trolley and interurban manufacturer. At its height, Brill was the largest manufacturer of streetcars and interurban cars in the US and produced more streetcars, interurbans and gas-electric cars than any other manufacturer, building more than 45,000 streetcars alone. \n\nThe company was founded by John George Brill in 1868 as a horsecar manufacturing firm in Philadelphia. Its manufacturing factory complex was located in Southwest Philadelphia at 62nd St and Woodland Avenue adjacent to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tracks. Over the years, it absorbed numerous other manufacturers of trolleys and interurbans such as Kuhlman in Cleveland and Jewett in Indiana. In 1944, with business diminishing, it merged with the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) to become ACF-Brill. Although the company ceased production in 1954, some of its interurbans served the Philadelphia area until the 1980s.\n\nIn 1868, the Brill company was founded as \"J.G. Brill and Sons\". After James Rawle joined the firm in 1872 it was renamed \"The J.G. Brill Company\".\n\nIn 1902, Brill bought out the American Car Company; in 1904 G. C. Kuhlman Car Company and John Stephenson Company; and in 1907 Wason Manufacturing Company. Brill acquired a controlling share of the Danville Car Company in 1908, dissolving it in 1911, and Canadian railway car builder Preston Car Company in 1921, which ceased operating in 1923. \n\nAs large orders continued to be won by Brill, new facilities including steel forges and cavernous erecting shops continued to be added in Philadelphia. One particularly large order, received in 1911, was for 1,500 streetcars for the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company. It took two years to build those trolleys with delivery rates at times exceeding a hundred cars a month. All told, more than 30,000 rail vehicles were produced at the Brill plant. In its best years, a workforce of 3,000 Philadelphians was employed by Brill; many of those were skilled laborers and craftsmen.\n\nThe last rail cars built by J.G. Brill were 25 streamliners for Atlantic City in 1939, and a final 10 trolleys for Red Arrow Lines two years later. Production shifted to rubber-tired vehicles, with more than 8,000 gasoline- and electric-powered buses (trolley buses) built in the 1940s. But by the early 1950s even the bus orders had dried up. In March 1954, the plant was sold to the Penn Fruit Company and a strip mall was built on the eastern end of the site.\n\nIn 1926, American Car and Foundry Company acquired a controlling interest in what had become the Brill Corporation. The new structure consisted of:\nIn 1944, these two companies merged, forming the ACF-Brill Motors Company. \n\nIn the same year, ACF-Brill licensed Canadian Car and Foundry of Montreal to manufacture and sell throughout Canada motor buses and trolley coaches of their design as Canadian Car-Brill. The firm built about 1,100 trolley buses and a few thousand buses under the name. Brill had earlier (in 1908) established a company in France (Cie. J.G. Brill of Gallardon, which was sold to Electroforge in 1935).\n\nIn 1946, Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation acquired a controlling interest in ACF-Brill for $7.5 million. Consolidated Vultee was sold the following year to the Nashville Corporation, which in 1951 sold its share to investment firm Allen & Co. \nIn early 1954, the Brill name disappeared when ACF-Brill ceased production and subcontracted its remaining orders.\n\nBrill granted licenses to build its vehicles to the Canadian Car and Foundry Company (Peter Witt streetcars, trolley buses and motor buses) and the South Australian Railways (Model 75 railcars).\n\n\nThe lines that operated interurban passenger cars recognized in the mid-1920s that they needed faster, quieter, more power-efficient equipment. Until then, the wooden and most of the steel interurban cars were large, sat high, and were heavy. Streetcars were slow, noisy, and clumsy to operate using the motor controller \"stand\" of the time. Car manufacturers such as Cincinnati Car Company (who already in 1922 made a lightweight, albeit slow, interurban), St. Louis Car Company, Pullman, and Brill worked to design equipment for a better ride at high speed, improved passenger comfort, and reduced power consumption. This particularly involved designing low-level trucks (bogies) able to handle rough track at speed. Brill, in conjunction with Westinghouse and General Electric, worked on a new interurban design and on a new streetcar design (the PCC). \n\nThe interurban design result was the aluminum-and-steel, wind-tunnel-developed, slope-roof \"Bullet\" multiple-unit cars, the first of which were purchased in 1931 by the Philadelphia and Western Railroad, a third-rail line running from 69th Street Upper Darby to Norristown in the Philadelphia region. This line still runs as SEPTA's Norristown High Speed Line. The Bullets could attain speeds as high as . They were very successful, and operated until the 1980s, but Brill sold few others. Only the central New York state interurban Fonda, Johnstown, and Gloversville Railroad ordered Bullets, albeit a single-ended, single-unit \"trolley-ized\" version. Five were procured in mid-Depression 1932 for passenger business that was rapidly declining. In 1936, the closing FJ&G sold these Bullets to the Bamberger Railroad in Utah, which ran them in high-speed service between Salt Lake City and Ogden until the mid-1950s. \n\nThree of the SEPTA Bullet cars are now at the Seashore Trolley Museum; one is at the Electric City Trolley Museum in Scranton; one is at the Rockhill Trolley Museum in Orbisonia, Pennsylvania; one is at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri; and one is at the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum in Washington, Pennsylvania. A Bamberger Bullet is in the Orange Empire Railroad Museum in Perris, California, and another has been preserved by the Utah State Railroad Museum. A third is a part of a restaurant building in Springville, Utah, but is barely recognizable as a Bullet.\n\nSince 2015 the JR Kyushu, one of the constituent companies of Japan Railways Group, has operated the Aru Ressha \"sweet train\", a deluxe excursion train. It comprises two power cars and two newly built trailer cars based on a luxury Brill car the railway ordered in 1908 but never used. Scale models of the original cars were used to derive the design. \n\n\n\n"}

In 2019, the student population at FSC consisted of 3,073 students along with 130 full-time faculty members. The college offers 50 undergraduate majors and pre-professional programs, graduate programs in nursing, business, and education as well as post-graduate programs in nursing, education, and physical therapy.\n\nFlorida Southern is the home of the world's largest single-site collection of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. For its 2011 and 2012 rankings, \"The Princeton Review\" selected Florida Southern's campus as the most beautiful in the country.\n\nFlorida Southern has won 30 national titles in NCAA Division II competition in several sports, men's golf (13 titles), baseball (9), women's golf (4), men's basketball (2), softball (1) and women's lacrosse (1). The college's official mascot is Mocsie the water moccasin, but they are also referenced by their nickname, the Mocs. The official colors of the college and its athletic teams are scarlet and white.\n\nFlorida Southern is the oldest four-year private college in the state of Florida. The college was first founded as South Florida Institute in Orlando, Florida in 1883, and moved to nearby Leesburg in 1885. Historians contend that the college's formal establishment occurred when it was sponsored by the United Methodist Church following the move to Leesburg in 1885. It was known as Florida Conference College.\n\nThe college moved to Sutherland (now Palm Harbor) in 1901, and changed its name to Southern College in 1906. Due to fires in the early 1920s, it was temporarily relocated to Clearwater Beach and then finally moved to its current location in Lakeland in 1922. In 1935 it was renamed Florida Southern College by the college's board of trustees.\n\nThe present campus comprises 70 buildings on 110 acres of land and is home to the largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture in the world. Frank Lloyd Wright: -- L1100207Frank Lloyd Wright: -- L1100202 listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district due to the historical significance of its buildings. In 2012, the college became a part of the National Historic Landmarks of the United States. In 2011 and 2012, it was selected as the most beautiful campus in America by The Princeton Review. In September 2011, Travel+Leisure listed it as one of the most beautiful campuses in the United States and noted that it was put under watch by the World Monument Fund as an endangered cultural site.\n\nThe college has undergone many changes to its infrastructure in the last few years. Florida Southern commissioned Robert A. M. Stern, the dean of Yale's architecture program, to lead their large expansion efforts in 2005. Stern is an accomplished American architect who won the Driehaus Architecture Prize in 2011. The Stern-designed Barnett Residential Life Center was completed in 2009. The complex includes Nicholas and Wesley Halls, and houses up to 235 students in lake-view rooms designed to complement Frank Lloyd Wright's existing architecture on campus. Marshall and Vera Lea Rinker bestowed to the school $1.5 million to construct a technology center in 2008. The 4,000 sq.ft. Rinker Technology Center opened in March 2010. According to Stern, his new buildings are intended to \"honor Wright's historic legacy while putting my own mark on the campus by complementing, not copying, Wright.\" Stern also designed the Robert E. Christoverson Humanities and the Becker Business Building.\n\nIn addition to improving the campus proper, FSC also expanded outwardly by acquiring properties in adjacent neighborhoods. The college acquired the Lake Hollingsworth Apartments and Lake Morton Apartments which are about a 12-minute walking distance from campus. In 2011, the school bought, renovated, and furnished Lake Morton Apartments for $5.7 million. As part of the Pathway to Independence Program, upperclassmen and graduate students who are in good standing may be invited to live at this location.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright was an influential architect of the twentieth century. In 1938, the Florida Southern College president, Ludd M. Spivey, approached Wright with the task of transforming the 100-acre lakeside orange grove into a modern campus. The collection of Frank Lloyd Wright Architecture at Florida Southern College is called Child of the Sun. The name for the architecture came from Wright's idea of removing the \"uninspired\" buildings of the existing campus and replacing them with a campus that would, according to Wright, \"grow out of the ground and into the light, a child of the sun.\" The works by Wright include the following:\n\n\nResidence Halls\n\nThe E.T. Roux library, typically referred to as simply the \"Roux Library,\" is located on the campus of Florida Southern College in Lakeland, FL. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for his Child of the Sun campus, the original Roux Library was built between the years of 1941-1945 at the cost of $120,000. The building is circular and housed a multi-tiered reading room in addition to library stacks. In March 1968, the new Roux Library opened in a different location on campus. The new location was designed by Nils Schweizer in a mid-century modern style. Schweitzer was a protege of Frank Lloyd Wright and went on to have a successful architectural career in the state of Florida.\n\nAfter the Roux Library moved in 1968, the original building was renamed the Thad Buckner Building and was used for lectures, seminars, and was the visitor's center for the Child of the Sun campus. Today, the visitor's center has moved into a new location. The space is still used for lectures and can also be rented for private events. Typical of Frank Lloyd Wright style, the original Roux Library was constructed of reinforced concrete and concrete blocks. Long, narrow windows crown the concrete walls and interspersed throughout the concrete walls are small colorful cubes of glass that cast the sunlight in prismatic patterns.\n\nFlorida Southern College has over 50 undergraduate majors in a variety of disciplines and offers the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Music Education, and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. At the graduate level, the school offers the degrees Master of Business Administration, Master of Accountancy, Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Education, Master of Science in Nursing, and a Doctoral in Educational Leadership. Florida Southern College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. Florida Southern uses the learning style of engaged learning, in which the college incorporates engaging, hands-on experiences in every academic program. Florida Southern College was awarded the William M. Burke Presidential Award for Excellence in Experiential Education in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, the College announced an undisclosed contribution from Carol Jenkins Barnett ('79) (daughter of George W. Jenkins, founder of the giant Lakeland-based grocery chain Publix, for whom the school's gymnasium is named) in honor of her husband, Barney Barnett ('65). The funds would be used to establish the Barney Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise. This gesture came shortly after Richard W. \"Bill\" Becker ('65) gifted $5 million to the School for the construction of a new undergraduate business building. Construction of the Becker Undergraduate Business Building and the Graduate and Executive Building was scheduled to begin late 2012 or early 2013. Like the Barnett Residential Life Center, these two buildings were also to be designed by architect Robert A. M. Stern\n\nUndergraduate students at the Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise study in one of six programs: accounting, business administration, business and free enterprise, finance and economics, healthcare administration, or political economy. The school also allows students to focus on career tracks in finance, international business, management, marketing, and sport management. The Barnett School also offers the Master of Business Administration to full-time students in its 16-month accelerated program, as well as part-time students in the form of evening and Saturday classes. The Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise was accredited by AACSB-International in 2013.\n\nThere are five primary disciplines within the school: communications, fine and performing arts, humanities, natural science and mathematics, and the social and behavioral sciences. The school features a combination of traditional programs and interdisciplinary studies that includes the opportunity for students to design their own major through the \"Venture into Adventure\" program. The citrus science program has the nation's only citrus bachelor's degree program, including courses taught by industry leaders.\n\nThe Division of Biology offers the Bachelor of Science degrees in biology, biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB; in conjunction with the Division of Chemistry), Environmental Studies and Marine Biology.

Currently, the airport handles up to 38 commercial departures a day, or approximately 266 departures per week. Three major airlines serve the airport; Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, and WestJet.\n\nIn 2018, YLW overtook Victoria International Airport to become Canada's 10th busiest airport by passenger traffic with 2,080,372, representing a 9.9% increase over 2017.\n\nIn 1946, a plebiscite was held which authorized the city of Kelowna to purchase the 320-acre Dickson Ranch for $20,000. The airport was opened in 1947 with a 3,000 foot long grass airstrip and a small terminal. Commercial service first began in 1958 by Canadian Pacific Airlines to Vancouver. In 1960, the runway was paved and extended to 5,350 feet. Through the 1960s and 1970s the airport continued to be expanded with a new terminal building, an air traffic control tower, and an onsite weather office. From the late 1960s to the mid 1980s, Pacific Western Airlines was the primary passenger air carrier serving the airport with Boeing 737-200 jetliners on nonstop and direct flights between Kelowna and Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and other small cities in British Columbia with the airline also operating Convair 640 and de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops as well as Douglas DC-3 and Piper Navajo prop aircraft on regional flights. By 1985, Pacific Western had become an all-jet airline and was operating up to sixteen departures a day with the Boeing 737-200 from Kelowna including direct, no change of plane service to Toronto. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s commercial and cargo traffic increased necessitating more than $10 million of investment in upgrades to the terminal building, runway and airline operating facilities.\n\nIn 1996, Greyhound Air was flying daily nonstop service to its hub in Winnipeg with direct one stop service to Hamilton, Ontario with Boeing 727-200 jetliners operated by local company Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter (now KF Cargo). Also in 1996, WestJet was operating nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet service to Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia as well as direct one stop 737 service to Regina.\n\nIn 1998, a $20 million expansion program doubled the size of the terminal building, increased parking, and expanded airside facilities to accommodate the projected 1 million passengers by 2011. By 1999, five airlines were serving Kelowna: Air BC with code sharing flights on behalf of Air Canada, Central Mountain Air with code sharing flights also on behalf of Air Canada, Canadian Regional Airlines with code sharing flights including Fokker F28 Fellowship jet service on behalf of Canadian Airlines, Horizon Air with code sharing flights on behalf of Alaska Airlines and WestJet with the latter air carrier continuing to operate Boeing 737-200 jets on all of its flights at this time.\n\nThe recently expanded main terminal building is a modern, full-service facility covering approximately . There are 10 aircraft loading positions, half of which are fitted with jet bridges. The arrivals area contains three baggage carousels, one of which can be cordoned off to accommodate international/US arrivals (and remaining two for domestic arrivals) and Canadian Customs processing (The airport has CATSA pre-board screening area, but not US pre-boarding clearance zone).\n\nSeveral food and beverage services, including Tim Horton's and White Spot Legends Restaurant, newsstands (Skyway Gifts and News), and tourist-related retail stores (Okanagan Estate Wine Cellar), in addition to a limited selection of duty-free goods (Okanagan Style and Duty Free), can be found in the terminal. The departure lounge features a wired business centre and complimentary wireless Internet. The airport's focal point is a glass rotunda which contains a fountain and the cylindrical glass sculpture \"Escape from Stella Polaris\" and Skyway Atrium Lounge. Kelowna Art Gallery operates a satellite site at the airport. A small observation area is located on the mezzanine level.\n\nKey destinations from the airport are Pacific Northwest (United States and Canada), Western Canada, Northern Canada, Toronto as well as seasonal connections to Southwestern United States, Mexico and Caribbean.\n\nCars, buses and taxis can connect to the airport for Kelowna via Highway 97. The airport has an outdoor parking lot next to the terminal and some short term spaces near the terminal building.\n\nThe airport is serviced by Kelowna Regional Route 23 and Vernon Regional Route 90 (rush hour service only) buses, which connect Vernon and Lake Country with UBC Okanagan Exchange in Kelowna. The airport is not served by the bus on evenings and weekends. Passengers heading to downtown Kelowna or West Kelowna can transfer to 97X Kelowna RapidBus at UBC Okanagan Exchange.\n\nIn 2006, the Kelowna International Airport Advisory Committee created the Master Plan 2025, a document dedicated to the expansion of the Kelowna International Airport. The Plan is expected to cost approximately $150 million. Due to YLW's unprecedented growth, a Master Plan was required to aid in keeping the airport at modern traffic handling standards. By 2008, the airport lengthened the single runway to , and plans to lengthen to by 2025. Also, the passenger terminal has been expanded so as to allow hourly processing of 680 passengers in 2015, and will be further expanded as to allow 900 passengers by 2025. Currently, the hourly rate is approximately 400 passengers. In order to do this, the terminal size will be nearly doubled, and a 2,400 space parkade will be constructed. Also, to reduce vehicular traffic congestion, a diamond overpass/underpass interchange will be constructed at the current intersection of Highway 97 and Airport Way.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838272", "title": "Johor Sultanate", "text": "Johor Sultanate\n\nThe Johor Sultanate ( or ; also called the Sultanate of Johor, Johor-Riau, Johor-Riau-Lingga, or the Johor Empire) was founded by Malaccan Sultan Mahmud Shah's son, Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II in 1528. Johor was part of the Malaccan Sultanate before the Portuguese conquered Malacca's capital in 1511. At its height, the sultanate controlled modern-day Johor, Riau, and territories stretching from the river Klang to the Linggi and Tanjung Tuan, Muar, Batu Pahat, Singapore, Pulau Tinggi and other islands off the east coast of the Malay peninsula, the Karimun islands, the islands of Bintan, Bulang, Lingga and Bunguran, and Bengkalis, Kampar and Siak in Sumatra. In 1564 the Ottomans conquered the Sultanate during the Ottoman expedition to Aceh. During the colonial era, the mainland part was administered by the British, and the insular part by the Dutch, thus breaking up the sultanate into Johor and Riau. In 1946, the British section became part of the Malayan Union. Two years later, it joined the Federation of Malaya and subsequently, the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. In 1949, the Dutch section became part of Indonesia.\n\nIn 1511, Malacca fell to the Portuguese and Sultan Mahmud Shah was forced to flee Malacca. The sultan made several attempts to retake the capital but his efforts were fruitless. The Portuguese retaliated and forced the sultan to flee to Pahang. Later, the sultan sailed to Bintan and established a new capital there. With a base established, the sultan rallied the disarrayed Malay forces and organised several attacks and blockades against the Portuguese position.\n\nBased at Pekan Tua, Sungai Telur, Johor, the Johor Sultanate was founded by Raja Ali Ibni Sultan Mahmud Melaka, known as Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II (1528–1564), in 1528. Although Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah and his successor had to contend with attacks by the Portuguese in Malacca and by the Acehnese in Sumatra, they managed to maintain their hold on the Johor Sultanate.\n\nFrequent raids on Malacca caused the Portuguese severe hardship and it helped to convince the Portuguese to destroy the exiled sultan's forces. A number of attempts were made to suppress the Malay but it was not until 1526 that the Portuguese finally razed Bintan to the ground. The sultan then retreated to Kampar in Sumatra and died two years later. He left behind two sons named Muzaffar Shah and Alauddin Riayat Shah II.\n\nMuzaffar Shah continued on to establish Perak while Alauddin Riayat Shah became the first sultan of Johor.\n\nThe new sultan established a new capital by the Johor River and, from there, continued to harass the Portuguese in the north. He consistently worked together with his brother in Perak and the Sultan of Pahang to retake Malacca, which by this time was protected by the fort \"A Famosa\".\n\nOn the northern part of Sumatra around the same period, Aceh Sultanate was beginning to gain substantial influence over the Straits of Malacca. With the fall of Malacca to Christian hands, Muslim traders often skipped Malacca in favour of Aceh or also of Johor's capital Johor Lama (Kota Batu). Therefore, Malacca and Aceh became direct competitors.\n\nWith the Portuguese and Johor frequently locking horns, Aceh launched multiple raids against both sides to tighten its grip over the straits. The rise and expansion of Aceh encouraged the Portuguese and Johor to sign a truce and divert their attention to Aceh. The truce, however, was short-lived and with Aceh severely weakened, Johor and the Portuguese had each other in their sights again. During the rule of Sultan Iskandar Muda, Aceh attacked Johor in 1613 and again in 1615.\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Dutch reached Southeast Asia. At that time the Dutch were at war with the Portuguese and allied themselves to Johor. Two treaties were signed by Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge on behalf of the Dutch Estates General and Raja Bongsu (Raja Seberang) of Johor in May and September 1606. Finally in 1641, the Dutch and Johor forces headed by Bendahara Skudai, defeated the Portuguese. As per the agreement with Johor struck in May 1606, the Dutch took control of Malacca and agreed not to seek territories or wage war with Johor. Finally in January 1641, the Dutch (attacking by land and the sea) and Johor forces (attacking by land and under the leadership of Bendahara Skudai), defeated the Portuguese at Malacca. By the time the fortress at Malacca surrendered, the town's population had already been greatly decimated by famine and disease (the plague). As per article 1 of the agreement with Johor ratified in May 1606, the Dutch assumed control of the town of Malacca and also of some surrounding settlements. Malacca then became a territory under the control of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and formally remained a Dutch possession until the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 was signed.\n\nWith the fall of Portuguese Malacca in 1641 and the decline of Aceh due to the growing power of the Dutch, Johor started to re-established itself as a power along the Straits of Malacca during the reign of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III (1623–1677). Its influence extended to Pahang, Sungei Ujong, Malacca, Klang and the Riau Archipelago. During the triangular war, Jambi also emerged as a regional economic and political power in Sumatra. Initially there was an attempt of an alliance between Johor and Jambi with a promised marriage between the heir Raja Muda and daughter of the \"Pengeran\" of Jambi. However, the Raja Muda married instead the daughter of the Laksamana Abdul Jamil who, concerned about the dilution of power from such an alliance, offered his own daughter for marriage instead. The alliance therefore broke down, and a 13-year war then ensued between Johor and the Sumatran state beginning in 1666. The war was disastrous for Johor as Johor's capital, Batu Sawar, was sacked by Jambi in 1673. The Sultan escaped to Pahang and died four years later. His successor, Sultan Ibrahim (1677–1685), then engaged the help of the Bugis in the fight to defeat Jambi. Johor would eventually prevail in 1679, but also ended in a weakened position as the Bugis refused to go home, and the Minangkabaus of Sumatra also started to assert their influence.\n\nAfter the sacking of Batu Sawar in 1673, the capital of Johor was frequently moved to avoid the threat of attack from Jambi. All through its history, the rulers of Johor had in fact constantly shifted their centre of power many times in their efforts to keep the sultanate together. Johor Lama (Kota Batu) was initially founded by Alauddin Riayat Shah II but was sacked by the Acehnese in 1564. It was then moved to Seluyut, later back to Johor Lama during the reign of Ali Jalla (1571–1597) which was sacked by the Portuguese in 1587, then to Batu Sawar, and Lingga (again sacked by the Portuguese). This is followed by a period with no fixed capital (places included Tanah Puteh and Makam Tauhid) during the reign of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III before he moved it to Batu Sawar in 1640. After Batu Sawar was sacked by Jambi, later capitals included Kota Tinggi, Riau, and Pancur.\n\nIn the 17th century with Malacca ceasing to be an important port, Johor became the dominant regional power. The policy of the Dutch in Malacca drove traders to Riau, a port controlled by Johor. The trade there far surpassed that of Malacca. The VOC was unhappy with that but continued to maintain the alliance because the stability of Johor was important to trade in the region.\n\nThe Sultan provided all the facility required by the traders. Under the patronage of the Johor elites, traders were protected and prospered. With a wide range of goods available and favourable prices, Riau boomed. Ships from various places such as Cambodia, Siam, Vietnam and all over the Malay Archipelago came to trade. The Bugis ships made Riau the centre for spices. Items found in China or example, cloth and opium were traded with locally sourced ocean and forest products, tin, pepper and locally grown gambier. Duties were low, and cargoes could be discharged or stored easily. Traders found they do not need to extend credit, for the business was good.\n\nLike Malacca before it, Riau was also the centre of Islamic studies and teaching. Many orthodox scholars from the Muslim heartlands like the Indian Subcontinent and Arabia were housed in special religious hostels, while devotees of Sufism could seek initiation into one of the many Tariqah (Sufi Brotherhood) which flourished in Riau. In many ways, Riau managed to recapture some of the old Malacca glory. Both became prosperous due to trade but there was a major difference; Malacca was also great due to its territorial conquest.\n\nThe last sultan from the Malaccan dynasty, Sultan Mahmud Shah II, was a person of unstable disposition. When Bendahara Habib was the Bendahara, he effectively shielded the people from the Sultan 's idiosyncrasies. After the demise of Bendehara Habib, he was replaced by Bendahara Abdul Jalil. As the Bendahara was only a cousin, he could not rein in the Sultan 's eccentric behaviour.\n\nThe Sultan ordered the pregnant wife of a noble, Orang Kaya Megat Sri Rama killed, as she had taken a slice of the royal jack fruit. Subsequently, the Sultan was killed by Megat Sri Rama in revenge.\nSultan Mahmud Shah II of Johor had died in 1699 without an heir. The Orang Kayas, who were normally tasked with advising the Sultan, were in a fix. They went to Muar to meet Sa Akar DiRaja, Raja Temenggong of Muar, the Sultan's uncle and asked for his counsel. He pointed out that Bendahara Abdul Jalil should inherit the throne. The problem was resolved when the viceroy Bendahara Abdul Jalil was declared the new sultan and proclaimed Sultan Abdul Jalil IV. Many, particularly the Orang Laut (islanders from Johor maritime territories), however felt that the declaration was improper.\n\nThe Bugis, who played an important role in defeating Jambi two decades earlier, had a huge influence in Johor. Apart from the Malays, another influential faction in Johor at that time were the Minangkabau. Both the Bugis and the Minangkabau realised how the death of Sultan Mahmud II had provided them with the chance to exert power in Johor. The Minangkabau introduced a Minangkabau prince, Raja Kecil from Siak who claimed he was the posthumous son of Sultan Mahmud II. The prince met with the Bugis and promised the Bugis wealth and political power if they helped the prince to win the throne. However, Raja Kecil broke his promise and installed himself as the new Sultan of Johor (Sultan Abdul Jalil Rahmat Shah) without the knowledge of the Bugis. Sultan Abdul Jalil IV fled to Pahang where he was later killed by an assassin hired by Raja Kecil.\n\nDissatisfied with Raja Kecil's accession, the son of Sultan Abdul Jalil IV, Raja Sulaiman, asked Daeng Parani of the Bugis to aid him in his quest to reclaim the throne. In 1722, Raja Kecil was dethroned by Raja Sulaiman's supporters with the assistance of the Bugis. Raja Sulaiman became the new Sultan of Johore, but he was a weak ruler and became a puppet of the Bugis. Daeng Parani's brother, Daeng Merewah, who was made Yam Tuan Muda (crown prince) was the man who actually controlled Johor.\n\nThe Johor Sultanate continued the system of administration previously practised in Malacca. The highest authority lay in the hands of the \"Yang di-Pertuan\" who was known as the Sultan. The Sultan was assisted by a body known as the \"Majlis Orang Kaya\" (Council of Rich Men) which was tasked with advising the Sultan. Among them were the \"Bendahara\", \"Temenggong\", \"Laksamana\", \"Shahbandar\" and \"Seri Bija Diraja\". During the 18th century, the Bendahara lived in Pahang and the Temenggong Johor in Teluk Belanga, Singapore. Each one managed the administration of their individual areas based on the level of authority bestowed upon them by the Sultan of Johor.\n\nThe Johor Empire was decentralised. It was made of four main fiefs and the Sultan's territory. The fiefs are Muar and its territories under the Raja Temenggong of Muar; Pahang under the stewardship of the Bendehara; Riau under the control of YAM Tuan Muda and mainland Johor and Singapore under the Temenggong. The rest of the Empire were directly controlled by the Sultan. The Sultan resided in Lingga. All the Orang Kayas except Raja Temenggong Muar reported directly to the Sultan ; Raja Temenggong Muar was a suzerain recognised by the Sultan.\nAs the Sultanate replaced the Malacca Sultanate, it followed that the extent of its territorial area covered the southern Malay peninsular, parts of south-eastern Sumatra and the Riau Islands and its dependencies. This territory included the vassal states of Pahang, Muar, Johor mainland and Riau Islands. The administrative centre of the empire was at various times at Sayong Pinang, Kota Kara, Seluyut, Johor Lama, Batu Sawar and Kota Tinggi; all on mainland Johor and later at Riau and Lingga.\nIt then shifted with the birth of Modern Johore Sultanate to Tanjung Puteri, known today as Johor Bahru.\n\nIn 1818, Sir Stamford Raffles was appointed as the governor of Bencoolen on western Sumatra. However, he was convinced that the British needed to establish a new base in Southeast Asia to compete with the Dutch. Though many in the British East India Company opposed such an idea, Raffles managed to convince Lord Hastings of the Company, then Governor General of British India, to side with him. With the governor general's consent, he and his expedition set out to search for a new base.\n\nWhen Raffles' expedition arrived in Singapore on 29 January 1819 he discovered a small Malay settlement at the mouth of Singapore River headed by a Temenggong Abdul Rahman. Though the island was nominally ruled by the sultanate, the political situation there was extremely murky. The reigning sultan, Tengku Abdul Rahman, was under the influence of the Dutch and the Bugis. Hence, he would never agree to a British base in Singapore.\n\nHowever, Tengku Abdul Rahman was ruler only because his older brother, Tengku Hussein or Tengku Long, had been away in Pahang getting married when their father died in 1812. He was appointed by the Yam Tuan Muda of Riau, Raja Jaafar because according to him, in a Malay tradition, a person has to be by the dying sultan's side to be considered as the new ruler. However the matter has to be decided by the Bendehara as the \"keeper of adat (tradition)\". Predictably, the older brother was not happy with the development.\n\nRaja Jaafar's sister, the queen of the late Sultan, protested vehemently at her brother's actions with these prophetic words, \"... Which adat of succession is being followed? Unfair deeds like this will cause the Johor Sultanate be destroyed!\". And she held on the royal regalia refusing to surrender it.\n\nBendehara Ali was made aware of the affairs of the succession and decided to act. He prepared his fleet of boats to Riau to \"restore the adat\". The British upon knowing this despatched a fleet and set up a blockade to stop the forces of Bendehara Ali from advancing.\n\nWith Temenggong Abdul Rahman's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Hussein, then living in exile on one of the Riau Islands, back into Singapore. According to a correspondence between Tengku Hussain and his brother, he left for Singapore out of his concern of his son's safety. Unfortunately he was captured by Raffles and forced to make a deal.\nTheir agreement stated that the British would acknowledge Tengku Hussein as the \"legitimate ruler\" of \"Johor\", and thus Tengku Hussein and the Temenggong would receive a yearly stipend from the British. In return, Tengku Hussein would allow Raffles to establish a trading post in Singapore. This treaty was ratified on 6 February 1819.\n\nBendehara Ali was requested by the British to recognise Tengku Hussein as a ruler. However, Bendehara Ali claimed that he had no connection with the events in Singapore, as it is the Temenggong's fief and stated that his loyalty lies only with the Sultan of Johor in Lingga.\n\nThe Dutch were extremely displeased with Raffles' action. Tensions between the Dutch and British over Singapore persisted until 1824, when they signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. Under the terms of that treaty, the Dutch officially withdrew their opposition to the British presence in Singapore. Many historians contend that the treaty divided the spheres of influence between the Dutch and the English; Sultanate of Johor into modern Johor and the state of Riau-Lingga which exists \"de jure\" after the ouster of the last Sultan of Johor. However this treaty was signed secretly without the knowledge of the local nobility including the Sultan and thus its legitimacy was called into question.\n\nNevertheless, the British successfully sidelined Dutch political influence by proclaiming Sultan Hussein as the Sultan of Johor and Singapore to acquire legal recognition in their sphere of influence in Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia. The legitimacy of Sultan Hussein's proclamation as the Sultan of Johor and Singapore was controversial to some of the other Malay rulers. As he was placed on the throne by the British, he was also very much seen as a puppet ruler. Temenggong Abdul Rahman's position, on the other hand, was strengthened as it was with his co-operation that the British successfully took de facto control of Johor and Singapore; with the backing of the British he gained influence as Raja Ja'afar. Meanwhile, Sultan Abdul Rahman was installed as the Sultan of Lingga in November 1822, complete with the royal regalia. Sultan Abdul Rahman, who had devoted himself to religion, became contented with his political sphere of influence in Lingga, where his family continued to maintain his household under the administrative direction of Raja Ja'afar who ruled under the auspices of the Dutch.\n\nThe actors on this stage were three parties; the Colonial powers of British and the Dutch; the nobles who made agreement with the Dutch namely Raja Jaafar, Yam Tuan Muda of Riau and Temenggong Abdul Rahman, of Johore and Singapore ; the palace namely the Sultan, and the Bendahara who claimed he was not aware of any treaty signed with their knowledge. Because the treaties are not ratified by the Sultan or the Bendahara, the Malays tried not to pay heed to any action of the Colonial powers.\n\nThe Yam Tuan Muda has been accused of committing treachery by \"selling\" the sovereignty of Johore, however the counter argument is that neither the Sultan nor the Bendahara were parties to the treaty. The treaty was signed in secret and details were only known in 1855. The Temenggong, strengthened his position through his friendship with Great Britain, and gained influence, together with Britain, over the state at the expense of the Sultanate. This is especially true for the son of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, the ambitious Temenggong Abu Bakar succeeded in eventually usurping the throne.\n\nSultan Abdul Rahman died in 1832 and was replaced by his son, Sultan Muhammad Shah (reigning from 1832–1841). Raja Jaffar, Yam Tuan Muda of Riau died and the Sultan is in no hurry to appoint a successor. The Sultan saw the damage that was done to the Palace in his father's reign and decided to reemphasis and restore adat as a rule governing personal behaviour and the politics. He summoned Bendahara Ali (Raja Bendahara Pahang) to Lingga. At Lingga, an adat-steeped function was held. The Bendahara conducted ceremonies (as per adat) aimed at re-educating the nobility and the Sultan about their respective duties and responsibilities. Islam and politics were discussed. It was attended by all the nobles from across the Empire hence, proving that 'Sultan' of Singapore is not recognised by the Malays. The ceremonies also include installation of Tengku Mahmud (later ruling as Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar) as a Crown Prince and Tun Mutahir as Bendehara-in-waiting.\n\nIn 1841, Bendahara Ali appointed Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim to replace his father who died in 1825. The long interval was due to displeasure of the Bendahara over the affairs of Singapore. Conditions imposed during the appointment included paying a visit of fealty to the ruling Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar in Lingga. Sultan Hussein of Singapore died in 1835 and his prince Tengku Ali wished for the legitimacy granted to Temenggong Ibrahim, by the British and some Malay nobles. The British forwarded the request in 1841 to the Bendahara. Bendahara Ali.\n\nAfter waiting since 1835 for the 'appointment' as a Sultan, in 1852 Tengku Ali decided to return Johor' to the former Johor-Riau Empire by paying homage to Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar in Lingga. For three years Johor Empire was one again, except Singapore which was ceded to the British. Worried by the state of affairs, the British called Tengku Ali back to Singapore on the threat of cancelling his pension. In Singapore, he was frequently visited by Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar and their relations are cordial.\n\nThe worried British then forced the 1855 treaty between Temenggong Ibrahim and Tengku Ali. In exchange for recognition as a Sultan, Tengku Ali agrees to 'give up all of Johor'. The treaty was intended to solidify the position of Temenggong Ibrahim, their key ally.\n\nBendahara Ali was asked by the Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar about the 1855 treaty. In his reply, the Bendahara reiterated that the Temenggong was supposed to swear fealty to his majesty and on the behaviour of Tengku Ali, the Bendehara claimed ignorance. He also reiterated that he was not a party to any discussion with the British or the Dutch.\n\nThe Dutch were also very worried. It seemed that the Sultan is acting on his own and would not listen to any of the Dutch-influenced Yam Tuan Muda of Riau and the Bugis nobility. It erupted into an open dispute between Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar and the Bugis nobility over the appointment of new Yam Tuan Muda of Riau. The Bugis preferred candidate was also the Dutch choice. The Sultan resented having another foreign-backed Yam Tuan Muda of Riau. It resulted in a deadlock and the Sultan set sail to Singapore to cool off. It was during the Singapore trip that the last Sultan of the mighty Johore Empire was deposed by the Bugis nobility in 1857.\n\nAfter the ouster of the former Sultan of Johor-Riau, the Bugis nobles elected the new Sultan, Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Shah, the Sultan of the \"new\" Riau-Lingga Kingdom built on the Riau remnants of the Johore Empire. The Sultan signed an agreement with the Dutch. In the agreement he agreed to acknowledge the overlordship of the Dutch government among others. With a stroke of a pen, he broke up the Johor Empire into 2 big parts and has given up the sovereignty of his part of territory to the Dutch. This also marked the end of the original Johor-Riau Sultanate, that was descended from the Sultanate of Melaka. This division remains until today as the Malaysia-Indonesia border.\n\nTemenggong Daeng Ibrahim of Johore signed a treaty with Bendahara Tun Mutahir of Pahang in 1861. The treaty recognised the territories of Johor (mainland), the Temenggong and his descendants' right to rule it, mutual protection and mutual recognitions of Pahang and Johor. With the signing of this treaty, the remnants of the Empire became two independent states, Johor and Pahang.\n\nIn 1855, Temenggong Ibrahim selected Tanjung Puteri, a small fishing village in southern Johor which would later develop into Johor Bahru, as the administrative headquarters of the state. Temenggong Ibrahim was succeeded by his son, Temenggong Abu Bakar, who later took the title Seri Maharaja Johor.\n\nMuar was another vassal of Old Johor Empire and was ruled by its own Raja Temenggong. At gunpoint, the Raja Temenggong and the chieftains of Muar handed over the control of Muar to Temenggong Abu Bakar in 1877; this later contributed to the Jementah Civil War. Temenggong Abu Bakar, aided by the British won decisively. Abu Bakar went to Istanbul to seek recognition as the Sultan of Johor, to allay fears of his religious credibility.\n\nIn 1885, he went to London seeking the recognition from the British Queen, Queen Victoria on his sultanate and Johor's independence. He was warmly accepted by the Queen and a friendship treaty was signed. After that he was formally crowned the Sultan of Johor. The modern Sultanate of Johor ruled only over mainland Johor. The Old Johore Sultanate (Johore Empire) was thus broken up into its constituents- Pahang, Singapore, Lingga/Riau and mainland Johor.\n\nSultan Abu Bakar has often been credited as the \"Father of Modern Johor\" due to the modernisation of the state under his rule. He introduced a constitution known as \"Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor\" and developed an efficient administration system, officially moving administrative operation of the state to Johor Bahru. As the capital of the state, Johor Bahru witnessed significant growth and development, culminating to the construction of buildings on grand scales with architecture deriving from Western and Malay sources. Johor as a whole also enjoyed economic prosperity. An increased demand for black pepper and gambier in the nineteenth century lead to the opening up of farmlands to the influx of Chinese immigrants, creating Johor's initial economic base. The Kangchu system was put in place.\n\nIn 1914, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Abu Bakar's successor, was forced to accept a British Adviser and effectively became a crown protectorate of the Britain as part of the Unfederated Malay States. D.G. Campbell was dispatched as the first British advisor to Johor.\n\nUnder the reign of Sultan Ibrahim until his death in London in 1959, Johor transitioned from a British protectorate of the Unfederated Malay States, to a Japanese possession during Japanese occupation in World War II, to a federated state in the Malayan Union and Federation of Malaya.\n\nThe Johor Sultanate continues to exist as a member of the Conference of Rulers following Malaya's independence in 1957 and the formation of the Malaysian federation in 1963, with successive sultans presiding over modern Johor as ceremonious figureheads, including Sultan Ismail (1959–1981), Sultan Iskandar (1981–2010), and Sultan Ibrahim (2010–present). Sultan Iskandar served as the \"Yang di-Pertuan Agong\", the federal head of state of Malaysia, from 1984 to 1989.\n\n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/11868450\n\n"}
{"id": "1838275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838275", "title": "Hock Lee bus riots", "text": "Hock Lee bus riots\n\nThe Hock Lee bus workers' strike began on April 23, 1955. The incident was a result of failed negotiations between the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company and its bus workers. The workers wanted better working conditions while the employers wanted to protect their business interests. The strikes eventually escalated and resulted in a clash among the Singapore Bus Workers Union, Hock Lee Employee's Union, the Singapore Chinese Middle Schools Student Union and law enforcement on May 12, 1955. The event has been commonly understood as a violent confrontation between colonialists and communists. The event was however also born out of the conditions of colonial society as well as being part of a necessary modernisation trajectory that Singapore was embarking on.\n\nPost War Conditions and the rise of trade unions\n\nThe global trend of decolonisation, led the way for the liberalisation of Singaporean politics. The 1948 constitution that reformed the political and judicial systems in Singapore paved the way for Singapore's first elections in 1948. This partial liberalisation was impeded as the British saw their strategic interests in Southeast Asia being challenged by peasant uprisings especially in Malaya.\n\nRole of the British\n\nTo maintain their control, the British tried to construct a narrative of communist insurgencies and militarism which could be potentially threatening to the security of the region. On the premise of containing communist activities, emergency regulations were implemented in 1948. These emergency regulations increased \nrestriction on civil society meetings in Singapore. A turning point came as the Rendel Constitution was accepted by the British government and resulted in elections that brought David Marshall and the Labour Front party into power. This new constitution led to the provisional easing of restrictions under Emergency regulations, which in its turn sparked off much interest in politics among the people living in Singapore. This renewed liberalisation led to the establishment of many trade unions during this period which would have alarmed many employers that were worried about their business interests. Oppressive colonial educational and labour policies discriminated against Chinese students and workers. Perceived unjust colonial policies led to various episodes of labour unrests in 1954 and 1955. In 1954 there was The May 13 National Service Ordinance. And in 1955, there were three notable strikes namely the Hock Lee Bus workers' strike, the Singapore Traction Company strike and the Singapore Harbour Board strike.\n\nRole of Americans in Singapore's Labour Movement\n\nAmerican officials were alarmed by both the rise of social unrest in Singapore and the Singapore's Labour Front (SLF) inability to control labour radicalism. It was estimated that 31,000 workers were involved in 129 official and sympathy strikes between March and June 1955. Some work has been done to study the significance of certain figures that arose from United States government sources. The seeds of a communist discourse was being sown by American diplomats, pressuring the British government to take subversive actions against student and labour movements in post 1954 Singapore. Thus leading to the construction of events like the Hock Lee incident as a violent event instigated by communists. Ramakrishna's latest work on the communist threat in Singapore necessitates the polarisation of the scholarship on Singapore history and suggests that historians should take sides. Conventional historical narratives have represented the workers and students actions as violent and conceived out of communism. The emerging work on the Hock Lee incident have foregrounded the experiences of the people through the provision of accounts that focus on the social and economic anxieties that were felt by both the students and the workers due to life in colonial society.\n\nBilveer Singh stated that the Hock Lee riots revealed \"the ability of the communists to mobilise other elements of the [Communist United Front], such as the students.\" Singh's reconstruction of the Hock Lee riots rely on the works of Bloodworth, Drysdale, and Lee. His analysis agrees with the colonial perspective and concludes that the students' involvement in the Hock Lee incident was part of a larger plan of communist subversion. Bloodworth starts his narrative by accusing the 'communist' students of being at the centre of the violence that occurred in the Hock Lee event. He attributes the cause of the unrest to union leader, Fong Swee Suan and takes on a perspective which favours the actions of the bus company. The above conventional accounts commonly attribute the student involvement to be one of communist action and again do not give the students any form of political consciousness. The students who were involved in the riots were part of the Singapore Chinese Middle School Student Union (SCMSSU). The relationship between the workers and the students is one that is often overlooked in many accounts of history and thus leading to the common conclusion that students' involvement was part of a violent extremist movement. The British adopted a substitution strategy to replace Chinese schools with English institution. A ten-year education plan unveiled by the colonial administration in 1949 sought to significantly decrease student enrolment in Chinese vernacular schools. Chinese students were faced with the implementation of high school exams that served little purpose in ensuring the students' path into university. The National Service Ordinance act also disrupted the education of Chinese students as the colonial government was unwilling to allow them to defer if they had to sit for examinations. This eventually led to the May 13 incident in 1954. In January 1955, the students' application to register the SCMSSU was rejected and subsequently met with many obstacles which the students felt were unreasonable demands by the colonial government to prevent the set up of the student union. Newspaper reports of the government not providing help or compensation to victims of World War Two in Singapore also served as a reminder to students that they were being asked to fight for a government that does not have their interests at heart. Students were seen to be the allies of the workers serving as a political force that could influence the decisions of the ruling elite. Loh et al. highlighted that many of the workers were ex-students and that the Chinese school students knew that the workers who were intertwined in labour negotiations was a reflection of their future. The anxieties of the students coupled with the students' sympathy to the workers resulted in their support for the Hock Lee bus workers.\n\nC.M. Turnbull saw the cause of the riots to be a battle between moderate and left-wing politics within the People's Action Party (PAP) and attributed the workers' involvement to be one of \"joint direct militant campaign of obstruction and violence.\" The book Men in White also frames the Hock Lee event as a \"demonstration of the ruthlessness of the communists and their capacity to unleash violence in Singapore.\" In both these accounts, the bus workers were not given any political consciousness as the event is seen as a spontaneous one that was initiated by the communists that eventually went out of control. Workers in the 1950s were subject to the many effects of colonial society. As previously mentioned, the Rendel Constitution paved the way for the liberalisation of Singapore politics coupled with the workers increasing anxiety about wages and working conditions as seen from an increase from 11 trade unions in 1946, to 236 unions in 1955. The post-war colonial administration was seen to be corrupt and inefficient and blamed for the poor working and economic conditions that the workers were subjected to. Strikes became more frequent as progression in the trade union movement was being challenged by the employers' refusal to recognise the unions and in its turn form splinter unions that would threaten the existing unionised workers. The Paya Lebar Bus Company labour protest was one of 275 strikes that took place in 1955. These activisms set the backdrop for the Hock Lee Bus workers' strike. There is evidence that the Hock Lee Bus workers' strikes were not fully under the direction of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and that the workers were so passionate about their fight against colonial oppression and exploitation that even the MCP were not able to effectively restraint the workers. Therefore, the Hock Lee Bus Incident was not a moment of spontaneous communist action but was the effect of the intersections between opposing workers' and employers' sentiments towards the progressive establishment of trade unions which was one of the positive aspects of the Rendel Constitution. These activisms also arose as Singapore was going through a tough economic climate with goods prices increasing by almost 19 per cent; but wages only increased by 0.8 per cent between the period of 1950 and 1955. Workers like Lee Tee Tong, who were subject to poor working conditions and the harsh realities of the colonial political economy led them to be increasingly unhappy with the government. This led to unrest among the workers as many were struggling to make ends meet. These strikes proved to be effective as the wages of workers increased by about 10 per cent on an hourly basis over the course of 1955-1956.\n\nThe Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company was one of the eleven Chinese bus companies in Singapore that was in operation. In February, 1955, the workers started their own union and joined with the Singapore Bus Workers' Union (SBWU), the company instantly fired the organisers of the union in an attempt to dissolve the union. On February 24, the company went a step further to set up a rival yellow union and hired 200 new workers in the process. Feeling threatened, on April 22, 1955, the bus workers' union put up a notice to strike. The company proceeded to unemploy more than 200 workers who were related to the SBWU on April 24, 1955. This angered the workers further which prompted them to set up human blockades at the bus depot, stopping the buses from leaving. This injustice was not only felt by the workers but also by Chief Minister David Marshall who tried to plead their case with the company's management, but his efforts were futile. As the anniversary of the May 13 National Service Incident was approaching, the workers, many of whom were ex-Chinese school students would have also been reminded of what happened the year before. On May 12, 1955, multilateral talks to mediate the workers' disputes were hampered as police clashed with strikers which resulted in the death of four people and thirty-one people injured.\n\nOn 12 May 1955, later known as, a major riot involving an estimated 2,000 people broke out in the streets of Alexandra Road and Tiong Bahru. The police tried to break up the 2,000 students and strikers using tear gas. Four people died as a result, including Andrew Teo, a Constable with the Volunteer Special Constabulary, who was severely beaten by a mob, Yuen Yau Phang, another Chinese police officer who was allegedly burned to death in his car, Gene D. Symonds, an American press correspondent also beaten by the mob and Chong Lon Chong (zhāng lún quán 张伦铨), a sixteen-year-old student whose death caught the most attention.\n\nA 16-year-old student, Chong Lon Chong, died from a gunshot wound. In an initial Straits Times report, the student was shot one mile away from a hospital, but was paraded around for two and half-hours by the students to further arouse the crowd's emotion without sending him for medical treatment. The press, including the vernacular press and the English medium Straits Times, however later reported that it was revealed that the coroner stated in the lawyer's brief to Chong's mother that it was inconclusive as to whether the boy was dead or alive when he was shot. Furthermore, it was also established after the trial that the four men who were arrested were not students.\n\nWhile the Hock Lee incident has conventionally been portrayed be one of communist subversion, other sources suggest that the students and workers' involvements in the Hock Lee incident were also due to anxieties felt by these two groups as a result of the conditions of colonial society. The Hock Lee bus workers' strikes can also be seen as one of the catalysts for the modernisation of the bus transportation industry in Singapore. The Hock Lee workers' strikes as well as other similar transportation workers' strikes resulted in the nationalisation of the Singapore transportation industry, specifically the Chinese owned bus companies. Shortly after the Hock Lee workers' strikes, the Singapore Traction Company strikes occurred which motivated the Hawkins Report of 1956. The Hawkins Report called for the reformation of the transportation industry in Singapore through a consolidation of the Chinese bus companies. The Hawkins report advocated for a single entity to control transportation. The report was an evident reaction to the operational challenges, poor administration and labour discontent that was evident in many of the bus companies. In 1970, RP Wilson was appointed to look into the reorganisation of public transportation in Singapore which resulted in the establishment of the government-led Singapore Transport Advisory Board in 1970, which sought to not only nationalise the bus companies but also to create a more efficient transportation system. To many of the workers, these strikes helped them to gain a 'Singaporean' consciousness outside of colonialism. The strikes and the workers' sentiments however were quickly put out. Part of Singapore's modernisation project was to expand its tourism sector and an efficient transportation system was important for this growth. This did not leave room for any form of activism that would disrupt Singapore's necessary path towards modernity and economic development.\n\nMedia interest in the event sparked off some public debate. The Singapore Broadcasting Corporation's television series \"Diary of A Nation\", produced in 1988, covers the Hock Lee event in episode ten. The Hock Lee incident was also depicted in Channel News Asia's documentary feature on violence and communism in Singapore in the 1950s, \"Days of Rage\".\n\nA reaction to the film was published in the form of a three-part critique named, \"Hock Lee bus riots – fact or fiction by CNA?\" by The Online Citizen.\n\nThe riots were dramatised in the drama . The student Chen Anguo in the drama represented Chong Lon Chong due to his controversial death.\n\nHock Lee Bus strike and riots\n"}

MagBeam is different from a traditional electrostatic ion thruster in several ways, the primary one being that instead of the fuel and propulsion system being part of the payload craft, they are instead located on a platform held in orbit. It has also been suggested that the technology could be used to reduce the amount of space debris in orbit around Earth.\n\nMagBeam propulsion uses a helicon plasma source to produce a plasma beam. A helicon drive consists of a quartz tube wrapped in a radio antenna, into which a gas such as argon or xenon is injected. RF currents pass through the antenna creating a rapid variation of the electric field, ionizing the gas. The ionized gas is accelerated by a magnetic field to produce thrust. The helicon drive produces a tight beam of ions as the magnetic field that accelerates them continuously expands with the plasma beam keeping them focused. This ion beam is used to push a payload which is equipped with a small amount of gas for propellant such as argon or xenon, a power source and a set of electromagnets to produce a mini-magnetosphere magnetic sail. The gas propellant is ejected into the plasma beam being directed at the craft which heats and ionizes it.\n\nThe electromagnets repel this ionized gas imparting thrust upon the payload. This results in an acceleration of around 1 ms, much faster than traditional ion propulsion systems. This amount of acceleration would make it possible to make a trip to Mars in as little as 50 days, reaching speeds as high as 20 km/s. The deceleration is accomplished by having another platform at the other end of the journey directing a plasma beam at the payload. By eliminating the mass of the propulsion system from the payload the MagBeam system allows for much faster acceleration and higher top speeds than conventional propulsion systems mounted on the payload. One problem with the system is the need for a sufficiently dense power-source, with a massive battery bank being proposed for an Earth-Mars Mag-Beam facility massing some 3,000 tons.\n\nThe system proposed by Winglee would allow a round-trip from Earth to Mars in 90 days, with 11 days stop-over at Mars.\n\nA similar system for use of a particle beam to push a mini-magnetosphere magnetic sail was proposed by Geoffrey A. Landis in 2001 as a possible propulsion system for interstellar travel.\n\nWinglee has also proposed that the technology could be used to help clear space debris in Earth orbit by pushing items of debris out of orbit towards the atmosphere where they could burn up safely.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838280", "title": "Slutsky equation", "text": "Slutsky equation\n\nThe Slutsky equation (or Slutsky identity) in economics, named after Eugen Slutsky, relates changes in Marshallian (uncompensated) demand to changes in Hicksian (compensated) demand, which is known as such since it compensates to maintain a fixed level of utility. There are two parts of the Slutsky equation, namely the substitution effect, and income effect. In general, the substitution effect is negative. He designed this formula to explore a consumer's response as the price changes. When the price increases, the budget set moves inward, which causes the quantity demanded to decrease. In contrast, when the price decreases, the budget set moves outward, which leads to an increase in the quantity demanded. The equation demonstrates that the change in the demand for a good, caused by a price change, is the result of two effects:\n\n\nThe Slutsky equation decomposes the change in demand for good \"i\" in response to a change in the price of good \"j\":\n\nwhere formula_2 is the Hicksian demand and formula_3 is the Marshallian demand, at the vector of price levels formula_4, wealth level (or, alternatively, income level) formula_5, and fixed utility level formula_6 given by maximizing utility at the original price and income, formally given by the indirect utility function formula_7. The right-hand side of the equation is equal to the change in demand for good \"i\" holding utility fixed at \"u\" minus the quantity of good \"j\" demanded, multiplied by the change in demand for good \"i\" when wealth changes.\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side represents the substitution effect, and the second term represents the income effect. Note that since utility is not observable, the substitution effect is not directly observable, but it can be calculated by reference to the other two terms in the Slutsky equation, which are observable. This process is sometimes known as the Hicks decomposition of a demand change.\n\nThe equation can be rewritten in terms of elasticity:\n\nwhere ε is the (uncompensated) price elasticity, ε is the compensated price elasticity, ε the income elasticity of good i, and b the budget share of good j.\n\nThe same equation can be rewritten in matrix form to allow multiple price changes at once:\n\nwhere D is the derivative operator with respect to price and D is the derivative operator with respect to wealth.\n\nThe matrix formula_10 is known as the Slutsky matrix, and given sufficient smoothness conditions on the utility function, it is symmetric, negative semidefinite, and the Hessian of the expenditure function.\n\nWhile there are several ways to derive the Slutsky equation, the following method is likely the simplest. Begin by noting the identity formula_11 where formula_12 is the expenditure function, and \"u\" is the utility obtained by maximizing utility given p and \"w\". Totally differentiating with respect to \"p\" yields the following:\n\nMaking use of the fact that formula_14 by Shephard's lemma and that at optimum,\n\none can substitute and rewrite the derivation above as the Slutsky equation.\n\nA Giffen good is a product that is in greater demand when the price increases, which are also special cases of inferior goods. In the extreme case of income inferiority, the size of income effect overpowered the size of the substitution effect, leading to a positive overall change in demand responding to an increase in the price. Slutsky's decomposition of the change in demand into a pure substitution effect and income effect explains why the law of demand doesn't hold for Giffen goods.\n\n"}

He was then sent to Fort Shafter in Hawaii, where he earned his GED before being sent to Vietnam in December 1967.\nIn South Vietnam he was assigned to the 161st Assault Helicopter Company (later reorganized as the 123rd Aviation Battalion) with the rank of Specialist Four. Serving as a door-gunner on an OH-23 Raven observation helicopter, his crew chief was Specialist Four Glenn Andreotta and his pilot was Warrant Officer One Hugh Thompson, Jr..\n\nThirty years after the fact all three men were decorated with the Soldier's Medal for their heroic actions at My Lai.\n\nIn the early morning hours of March 16, 1968, during Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, Americal Division's assault on a hamlet known on U.S. military maps as My Lai 4, Colburn's OH-23 helicopter surprisingly encountered no enemy fire while hovering over this suspected headquarters of the Viet Cong 48th battalion. Spotting two possible Viet Cong suspects, Thompson forced the Vietnamese men to surrender and flew them off to the rear for tactical interrogation. He also marked the location of several wounded Vietnamese with a green smoke marker, a signal that they needed help.\n\nReturning to the My Lai area at around 09:00 after refueling, the crew noticed that the people they had marked were now dead. Out in a paddy field beside a dike 200 meters south of the hamlet, they marked the location of a wounded young Vietnamese woman. Thompson and his crew watched from a low hover as Captain Ernest Medina (Charlie Company's Commander) came up to the woman, prodded her with his foot, stepped back, and then shot and killed her. (At his court martial, Medina claimed that he had turned away from her and then, startled by the sound of sudden movement behind him, spun back around and shot her, thinking she had been hiding a weapon under herself.)\n\nThompson then flew over an irrigation ditch filled with dozens of bodies. Shocked at the sight, he radioed his accompanying gunships, knowing his transmission would be monitored by many on the net: \"It looks to me like there's an awful lot of unnecessary killing going on down there. Something ain't right about this. There's bodies everywhere. There's a ditch full of bodies that we saw. There's something wrong here.\"\n\nMovement from the ditch indicated to Thompson that there were still people alive in there. Thompson landed his helicopter and dismounted. David Mitchell, a sergeant and squad leader in 1st Platoon, Charlie Company, walked over to him. When asked by Thompson whether any help could be provided to the people in the ditch, the sergeant replied that the only way to help them was to put them out of their misery. Second Lieutenant William Calley (1st Platoon Leader, Charlie Company) then came up, and the two had the following conversation:\n\nThompson took off again, and Andreotta reported that Mitchell was now executing the people in the ditch. Furious, Thompson flew over the northeast corner of the village and spotted a group of about ten civilians, including children, running toward a homemade bomb shelter. Pursuing them were soldiers from 2nd Platoon, Charlie Company. Realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese, Thompson landed his aircraft between them and the villagers. Thompson turned to Colburn and Andreotta and told them that if the Americans began shooting at the villagers or him, they should fire their M60 machine guns at the Americans: \"Y'all cover me! If these bastards open up on me or these people, you open up on them. Promise me!\" Colburn (whose M60 faced 2nd Platoon) replied, \"You got it boss, consider it done.\" He turned his weapon to face the American soldiers and exchanged stares with them, but privately was uncertain if he could actually fire on his fellow countrymen. Thompson then dismounted to confront 2nd Platoon's leader, Lieutenant Stephen Brooks. Thompson told him he wanted help getting the peasants out of the bunker:\n\nBrooks declined to argue with him, even though as a commissioned officer he outranked Thompson.\n\nAfter coaxing the 11 Vietnamese out of the bunker, Thompson persuaded the pilots of the two UH-1 Huey gunships (Dan Millians and Brian Livingstone) flying as his escort to evacuate them. (Gunships would ordinarily never land in a combat zone.) While Thompson was returning to base to refuel, Andreotta spotted movement in an irrigation ditch filled with approximately 100 bodies. The helicopter again landed and the men dismounted to search for survivors. After wading through the remains of the dead and dying men, women and children, Andreotta extracted a live boy. Thompson flew the survivor to the ARVN hospital in Quang Ngai where he left the child under the care of a nun.\n\nUpon finally returning to their base at about 11:00, Thompson heatedly reported the massacre to his superior officer, Colonel Oran Henderson. Thompson's allegations of civilian killings quickly reached Lieutenant Colonel Frank Barker, the operation's overall ground commander. Barker radioed his executive officer to find out from Captain Medina what was happening on the ground. Medina then gave the cease-fire order to Charlie Company to \"knock off the killing\".\n\nAmerican commanders were initially successful in covering up the massacre. All of Thompson's crew received decorations for their actions at My Lai, with Colburn receiving the Bronze Star with Combat \"V\" device on May 14, 1968. An account of the action was fabricated for Colburn's document accompanying the decoration, and Thompson's signature was forged on the eyewitness report.\n\nOn December 20, 1969, Colburn testified to the investigative Peers Commission on what he had seen on March 16, 1968 in My Lai (4).\n\nAfter the war, Colburn married and became the father of a son, Conner. He managed a ski repair business in Oregon, and owned and managed an Atlanta business that sells orthopedic rehabilitation equipment.\n\nExactly thirty years later, Colburn and Thompson were awarded the Soldier's Medal, the United States Army's highest award for bravery not involving direct contact with the enemy. At the same time, a posthumous medal was also awarded to Andreotta. \"It was the ability to do the right thing even at the risk of their personal safety that guided these soldiers to do what they did,\" then-Major General Michael Ackerman said at the 1998 ceremony. The three \"set the standard for all soldiers to follow.\" Additionally on March 10, 1998, Senator Max Cleland (D-GA) entered a tribute to Thompson, Colburn and Andreotta into the record of the U.S. Senate. Cleland said the three men were, \"true examples of American patriotism at its finest.\" \n\nAlso in 1998, Thompson and Colburn returned to the village of My Lai, where they met some of the villagers they rescued, including Thi Nhung and Pham Thi Nhanh, two women who had been part of the group that was about to be killed by Brooks' 2nd Platoon. They also dedicated a new elementary school for the children of the village.\n\nBoth Colburn and Thompson were awarded the Peace Abbey \"Courage of Conscience Award\" on July 4, 1999.\n\nDuring the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, Colburn expressed a \"bad feeling\" about the invasion that he felt may have touched off a much larger war than was intended. He was at Hugh Thompson's bedside when the latter died of cancer on January 6, 2006.\n\nIn 2003, at a Moral Lecture Series address to midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, Colburn made the following remarks:\n\nCombat is chaotic. Combat is primal. And something surfaces in you, especially when you see people close to you fall. And it's very difficult to control. Your job as young officers is to monitor those men who are pulling the trigger to make sure that that primal instinct, you have to keep it in check somehow.\n\nFor the Dedication of the Peace Park of the massacre (March 16, 2001), Colburn was reunited with Do Ba, the young child Andreotta had rescued from the ditch. \"I'm very glad to see the man who rescued me,\" Ba said, as the two men lit incense at the graves of Ba's mother, sister and brother, who were 31, four and two when they were killed. \"He's a good man...But I still feel hatred for the soldiers who killed my mother, my brother and my sister.\" Colburn also appeared in a PBS \"American Experience\" special on the incident, which aired April 26, 2010.\n\nOn July 4, 1999, Colburn and Hugh Thompson co-chaired the Stonewalk Project which organized and led the physical pulling of the one ton granite, memorial stone for Unknown Civilians Killed in War from Sherborn, Massachusetts to Arlington National Cemetery. In March 2012, the Dover-Sherborn Press in Massachusetts published a column by Colburn commenting on the comparisons between the recent civilian massacre in Panjwai, Afghanistan and the My Lai massacre.\n\nColburn died on December 13, 2016 from cancer at the age of 67.\n\n"}
{"id": "1838287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838287", "title": "Shared services", "text": "Shared services\n\nShared services is the provision of a service by one part of an organization or group, where that service had previously been found, in more than one part of the organization or group. Thus the funding and resourcing of the service is shared and the providing department effectively becomes an internal service provider. The key here is the idea of 'sharing' within an organization or group. This sharing needs to fundamentally include shared accountability of results by the unit from where the work is migrated to the provider. The provider, on the other hand, needs to ensure that the agreed results are delivered based on defined measures (KPIs, cost, quality etc.).\n\nShared services is similar to collaboration that might take place between different organizations such as a Hospital Trust or a Police Force. For example, adjacent Trusts might decide to collaborate by merging their HR or IT functions.\n\nThere are two arguments for sharing services: The ‘less of a common resource' argument and the ‘efficiency through industrialization' argument. The former is ‘obvious': if you have fewer managers, IT systems, buildings etc; if you use less of some resource, it will reduce costs. The second argument is ‘efficiency through industrialization’. This argument assumes that efficiencies follow from specialization and standardization – resulting in the creation of ‘front' and ‘back' offices. The typical method is to simplify, standardize and then centralize, using an IT 'solution' as the means.\n\nShared services is different from the model of outsourcing, which is where an external third party is paid to provide a service that was previously internal to the buying organization, typically leading to redundancies and re-organization. There is an ongoing debate about the advantages of shared services over outsourcing. It is sometimes assumed that a joint venture between a government department and a commercial organization is an example of shared services. The joint venture involves the creation of a separate legal commercial entity (jointly owned), which provides profit to its shareholders.\n\nTraditionally the development of a shared-service organization (SSO) or shared-service centre (SSC) within an organization is an attempt to reduce costs (often attempted through economies of scale), standardized processes (through centralization). A global Service Center Benchmark study carried out by the Shared Services & Outsourcing Network (SSON) and the Hackett Group, which surveyed more than 250 companies, found that only about a third of all participants were able to generate cost savings of 20% or greater from their SSOs. At NASA, the 2006 switch to a shared services model is realizing nearly $20 million of savings annually. Further, by the end of 2015, the NASA Shared Services Center is expected to save the organization a total of over $200 million, according to NASA's Director of Service Delivery.\n\nA large-scale cultural and process transformation can be a key component of a move to shared services and may include redundancies and changes of work practices. It is claimed that transformation often results in a better quality of work life for employees although there are few case studies to back this up .\n\nShared services are more than just centralization or consolidation of similar activities in one location. Shared services can mean running these service activities like a business and delivering services to internal customers at a cost, quality, and timeliness that is competitive with alternatives.\n\nA shared service can take a variety of different commercial structures. The basic commercial structures include:\n\n\nIt is sometimes argued that there are three basic location variations for a shared service including:\n\n\nThis is not just to take advantage of wage arbitrage but to appreciate the talents of particular economies in delivering specific service offerings.\n\nThe difficulty with this argument is that near-shore and off-shore are normally associated with the outsourcing model and are difficult to reconcile with the notion of an internally shared service as distinct from an externally purchased service. Clearly, the use of off-shore facilities by a government department is not an example of shared services.\n\nIn establishing and running a shared service, benchmarking and measurement is considered by some as a necessity. Benchmarking is the comparison of the service provision usually against best in class. The measurement occurs by using agreed key performance indicators (KPIs). Although the amount of KPIs chosen differs greatly it is generally accepted that fewer than 10 carefully chosen KPIs will deliver the best results.\n\nOrganizations do attempt to define benchmarks for processes and business operations.\n\nBenchmarking can be used to achieve different goals including:<br>\n1. To drive performance improvements using benchmarks as a means for setting performance targets that are met either through incremental performance improvements or transformational change.<br>\n- Strategic: with a focus on a long-term horizon; and <br>\n- Tactical: with a focus on the short and medium term\n\n2. To focus an organization on becoming world class with processes that deliver the highest levels of performance that are better than those of its peer group.\n\nThe private sector has been moving towards shared services since the beginning of the 1980s. Large organizations such as the BBC, BP, Bristol Myers Squibb, Ford, GE, HP, Pfizer, Rolls-Royce, ArcelorMittal, and SAP are operating them with great success. According to the English Institute of Chartered Accountants, more than 30% of U.S. Fortune 500 companies have implemented a shared-service center, and are reporting cost savings in their general accounting functions of up to 46%.\n\nThe conventional accounting practice used to generate these figures is disputed however by management thinker Professor John Seddon, who argues that the measurement known as 'unit cost' tells you nothing about overall costs. Overall costs include 'failure demand', which is defined as a failure to do something or do something right for the customer.\n\nThe public sector has taken note of the benefits derived in the private sector and continues to strive for best practice. The United States and Australia among others have had shared services in government since the late 1990s. However, the failures of these projects are increasingly being reported by the press and exposed by opposition politicians.\n\nThe UK government under a central drive to efficiency following from the Gershon Review are working to an overall plan for realizing the benefits of shared services. The Cabinet Office has established a team specifically tasked with the role of accelerating the take up and developing the strategy for all government departments to converge and consolidate. The savings potential of this transformation in the UK Public Sector was initially estimated by the Cabinet Office at £1.4bn per annum (20% of the estimated cost of HR and Finance functions). The National Audit Office (United Kingdom) in its November 2007 report pointed out that this £1.4bn figure lacked a clear baseline of costs and contained several uncertainties, such as the initial expenditure required and the time frame for the savings.\n\nThere are reports of UK government shared service centres failing to realise savings, such as the Department of Transport's project, described as 'stupendous incompetence' by the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), has implemented shared services for a number of departments and functions. For example, IT Assist (the ICT Shared Service Centre) provides common infrastructure and desktop services to NICS staff in the office, at home or when mobile working.\n\nThe government of Canada instituted Shared Services Canada on August 4, 2011, with the objective of consolidating its data centres, networks and email systems. This follows a tendency to centralize IT services that has been followed by the provinces of British Columbia, Québec, and Ontario, as well as the federal government of the United States of America and some states like Texas. PriceWaterhouseCoopers recommended integrating government data centres in a report ordered by Public Works and Government Services Canada, revealed in December 2011.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the health service nationally has been reorganized from a set of regional Health Boards to a unified national structure, the Health Services Executive. Within this structure there will be a National Shared Services Organisation, based on the model developed at the former Eastern Health Shared Services, where procurement, HR, finance and ICT services were provided to health agencies in the Eastern Region of Ireland on a business-to business basis.\n\nOrganizations that have centralized their IT functions have now begun to take a close look at the technology services that their IT departments provide to internal customers, evaluating where it makes sense to provide specific technology components as a shared service. E-mail and scanning operations were obvious early candidates; many organizations with document-intensive operations are deploying scanning centers as a shared service.\n\nMany large organizations, in both the public and private sectors, are now considering deploying enterprise content management (ECM) technology as a shared service.\n\n\n"}

The treaty has not been negotiated and its terms remain to be defined. According to a proposal by the United States, fissile material includes high-enriched uranium and plutonium (except plutonium that is over 80% Pu-238). According to a proposal by Russia, fissile material would be limited to weapons-grade uranium (with more than 90% U-235) and plutonium (with more than 90% Pu-239). Neither proposal would prohibit the production of fissile material for non-weapons purposes, including use in civil or naval nuclear reactors.\n\nIn a 27 September 1993 speech before the UN, President Clinton called for a multilateral convention banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear explosives or outside international safeguards. In December 1993 the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 48/75L calling for the negotiation of a \"non-discriminatory, multilateral and international effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\" The Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament (CD) on 23 March 1995 agreed to establish a committee to negotiate \"a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\". However, substantive negotiations have not taken place.\n\nIn 2004, the United States announced that it opposed the inclusion of a verification mechanism in the treaty on the grounds that the treaty could not be effectively verified. On November 4, 2004, the United States cast the sole vote in the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly against a resolution (A/C.1/59/L.34) calling for negotiation of an effectively verifiable treaty. The Bush Administration supported a treaty but advocated an ad hoc system of verification wherein states would monitor the compliance of other states through their own national intelligence mechanisms.\nOn April 5, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama reversed the U.S. position on verification and proposed to negotiate \"a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons.\" On May 29, 2009, the CD agreed to establish an FMCT negotiating committee,\n\nHowever, Pakistan has repeatedly blocked the CD from implementing its agreed program of work, despite severe pressure from the major nuclear powers to end its defiance of 64 other countries in blocking international ban on the production of new nuclear bomb-making material, as well as discussions on full nuclear disarmament, the arms race in outer space, and security assurances for non-nuclear states. Pakistan justified its actions when Chairman joint chiefs General Tariq Majid argued that \"a proposed fissile material cutoff treaty would target Pakistan specifically.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838317", "title": "John Coffee", "text": "John Coffee\n\nJohn R. Coffee (June 2, 1772 – July 7, 1833) was an American planter and state militia general in Tennessee. He commanded troops under General Andrew Jackson during the Creek Wars (1813–14) and during the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812.\n\nDuring his presidency, Jackson appointed Coffee as his representative, along with Secretary of War John Eaton, to negotiate treaties with Southeast American Indian tribes to accomplish removal, a policy authorized by Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Coffee negotiated the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek of 1830 with the Choctaw by which they ceded their lands, and started negotiations with the Chickasaw, but they did not conclude a treaty until after his death.\n\nBorn in Prince Edward County, Virginia, Coffee was the son of Captain Joshua Coffee (January 26, 1745 – September 8, 1797) and Elizabeth Graves (January 28, 1742 – December 13, 1804). His grandfather, Peter Coffee, Sr. was Irish and was probably born around 1705. In 1730 he was released from the Old Bailey and \"transported\" to Virginia where he labored as an indentured servant in the tobacco fields for 14 years, gaining his freedom in 1744.\n\nJohn Coffee married Mary Donelson, the daughter of Captain John Donelson III and Mary Purnell, on October 3, 1809. A paternal aunt of Mrs. Coffee was Andrew Jackson's wife, Rachel Donelson Robards.\n\nCoffee and Jackson were in business together. Before John Coffee's marriage, Jackson sold his partnership in their joint merchandising business to Coffee, taking promissory notes for the sale. After the wedding, Jackson gave Coffee the notes as his wedding present to the couple.\n\nCoffee was a merchant and land speculator. He was considered to be the most even-tempered and least selfish of Jackson's lifelong friends. Described as a big awkward man, careless of dress, and slow of speech, Coffee was also said to be kindly, tactful and wise.\n\nIn early 1806, Coffee challenged Nathaniel A. McNairy to a duel for publishing derogatory statements about Jackson. The duel took place on March 1, 1806, over the Tennessee line in Kentucky. McNairy unintentionally fired before the \"word\", wounding Coffee in the thigh. In return, McNairy offered to lay down his pistol and give Coffee an extra shot. The weapons used in this duel were also used in the Jackson-Dickinson duel on May 30, 1806.\n\nAt the beginning of the War of 1812, Coffee raised the 2nd Regiment of Volunteer Mounted Riflemen, composed mostly of Tennessee militiamen (and a few men from Alabama). In December 1812, Governor Willie Blount had called out the Tennessee militia in response to a request from General James Wilkinson and the U.S. Secretary of War. Under Jackson's command, Coffee led 600 men in January 1813 to Natchez, Mississippi Territory, via the Natchez Trace, in advance of the rest of the rest of the troops, who traveled via flatboats on the major rivers.\n\nAfter the two groups reunited in Natchez, Wilkinson and the U.S. government disbanded Jackson's troops. All marched back to Nashville to disband, and on this march Jackson earned the nickname \"Old Hickory\" from his troops. They arrived in Nashville on May 18, 1813.\n\nOn September 4, 1813, Coffee was involved in the Andrew Jackson–Benton brothers duel in Nashville, knocking Thomas Benton down a flight of stairs after Benton's failed assassination attempt on Jackson.\n\nIn October 1813, the 2nd Regiment was combined with Colonel Cannon's Mounted Regiment and the 1st Regiment of Volunteer Mounted Gunmen to form a militia brigade of mounted infantry. Coffee was promoted to brigadier-general and placed in command.\n\nCoffee led his brigade, which included free blacks and Native American warriors from allied Southeast tribes, at the 1814-15 Battle of New Orleans. They played a key role in holding the woods to the east of the British column. Coffee's brigade was the first to engage the British, by firing from behind the trees and brush.\n\nJackson chose General Coffee as his advance commander in the Creek War (concurrent with the War of 1812), during which he commanded mostly state militia and allied Native Americans. Under Jackson, Coffee led his brigade at the Battle of Tallushatchee, the Battle of Talladega, and the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek, where he was seriously wounded; and at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. At the latter, the allied forces conclusively defeated the Red Sticks, traditionalists of the Creek Nation who were allied with the British.\n\nAfter the war and some failed investments, Coffee began work as a surveyor. In 1816 he surveyed the boundary line between Alabama Territory and Mississippi Territory. He later moved to a place near Florence, Alabama.\n\nHis friend and former business partner Jackson was elected President. Jackson worked toward removal of Southeast Native American tribes to lands west of the Mississippi River. He appointed Coffee as his representative, along with Secretary of War John Eaton, to negotiate treaties which would accomplish removal, a policy authorized by Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Coffee negotiated the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek of 1830 with the Choctaw by which they ceded their Southeastern lands. Coffee started negotiations with the Chickasaw, but the U.S. did not conclude a treaty with these people until after his death.\n\nCoffee died in Florence on July 7, 1833, at age 61.\n\nCoffee County, Alabama, Coffee County, Tennessee, and the towns of Coffeeville, Alabama, Coffee Springs, Alabama (now in Geneva County but formerly part of Coffee County), Coffeeville, Mississippi, and Fort Coffee, Oklahoma, are named in his honor.\n\nResearchers often confuse General John Coffee with his first cousin John E. Coffee (1782–1836), who was a general in the Georgia militia and elected as a U.S. Congressman there.\n\nGeneral Coffee is sometimes referred to as \"John R. Coffee\". Some researchers have attempted to document the use of this middle initial in original sources. To date, he has been found to have signed his name \"John Coffee\" in the original papers examined. Scholars believe he didn't use the middle initial.\n\nGeneral John (R.) Coffee is buried in the Coffee Cemetery off State Road 157, northwest of Florence, Alabama.\n\nThe legendary Texas Ranger, John Coffee Hays, was a cousin of Mrs. Coffee and was named after him.\n\n"}
{"id": "1838324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838324", "title": "FitzJohn", "text": "FitzJohn\n\nFitzJohn was a bus manufacturer in Muskegon, Michigan. The company was founded October 8, 1919, by Harry Alphonse FitzJohn, and built over 5,000 bus bodies, complete buses, stretchout sedans and passenger-carrying trailers before closing down in May 1958.\n\nThe FitzJohn company was formed in 1919 to build truck and bus bodies. The former were mostly for Ford chassis, while the latter were for REOs. Originally sold under the Fitz-Er marque, the buses were soon badged as FitzJohn. FitzJohn's best selling point was the low price relative to its quality, which led to enough success that a new plant was purchased in 1924, five times larger than the original. Sales continued to increase, doubling from 1924 to 1925, and in the late 1920s FitzJohn was delivering almost 300 bodies a year. At that time FitzJohn models had a simple letter designation, although some had rather basic names, too. However, since so many options (such as rooftop luggage racks or polished aluminum bright-work) were offered, many of the variations were also given Indian names by the company's sales & marketing department.\n\nFrom 1 January 1929, FitzJohn began selling directly to consumers, rather than exclusively through chassis manufacturers and dealers. This change, however, did not prevent a 40% decline in sales due to the Depression, and on 8 June 1931, the company went into receivership. Its founder (H.A. FitzJohn) was forced out, and went into partnership with Paul O. Dittmar to produce the 12- to 15-passenger Dittmar-FitzJohn Autocoach (similar to the model D, but with a lowered aisle along the right side). H.A. FitzJohn later became the first manager of the General American Aerocoach Company.\n\nIn 1934 FitzJohn introduced its 11-passenger stretchout model 100. It was based on the Chevrolet Master Sedan which was split in the middle, had an extra body section inserted and a baggage rack added to the roof. The 100 was an immediate success, primarily as an economical \"mini-coach\" for feeder routes, although some were used for airport transfers or sightseeing services. During World War II, when many other bus manufacturers suspended production in favour of war materiel, the War Production Board directed FitzJohn to build a 15-passenger version of the 100. Otherwise-surplus Chevrolet, Pontiac and Packard sedans had extra rows of back-to-back seats installed, but because of wartime restrictions, white ash framing and Masonite panels were used instead of metal. Sixty-two enclosed auto haulers were also converted to passenger-carrying trailers in 1943.\n\nStarting about 1940, under the direction of James J. St. Croix FitzJohn began to switch from building bodies for other manufacturers' chassis to their own integral models. The last bus body delivered was a model 625 in March 1940 for a White 1012 demonstrator chassis. In 1950 diesel power began to be offered as an option. At the same time the current models were redesigned with rear engines. Even though the Cityliner offered unparalleled maintenance access to the engine (the rear corner panels swung out, as well as the back panels lifted up), FitzJohn could not compete against the larger manufacturers (such as GM and Twin Coach) and decided to leave the transit market in 1954.\n\nFitzJohn's last offering was the Roadrunner. Officially designated the FID (FitzJohn Interurban Diesel with a 150 hp Cummins JBS-600) or FIG (with a Gasoline Waukesha 176 hp 140-GK), the Roadrunner was offered as a 37-passenger coach with a wheelbase, or a shortened 33-seat version on a wheelbase. Only 14 FIGs were built, and all but a handful of the Roadrunners were 37-seaters. The last FitzJohns built for an American customer were five Roadrunner Sightseer variants (with roof windows) for Florida Greyhound Lines. The Muskegon factory closed in May 1958, after the last order of 54 FIDs was delivered to Mexico.\n\nSales records exist for the 31 years 1927 through 1958. During that time FitzJohn constructed 2,621 buses and coaches, 1,460 bodies, 776 stretchouts, and 62 trailer conversions. It is estimated that over 400 bus bodies—plus a small number of truck bodies—were built in the years 1921–1927, for a total of over 5,300 units.\n\nIn 1949 FitzJohn purchased surplus land and a airplane hangar adjacent to the Brantford, Ontario airport. The first buses built by FitzJohn Coach of Canada Ltd. were delivered to Hollinger Bus Lines (a suburban Toronto company) in May 1950. The Brantford plant built 197 buses during \nits entire existence. Initially the front-engined 310 Cityliner was produced, but construction switched to the rear-engine FTD and FTG. In 1958 the facility was sold to Blue Bird, allowing that company to expand into Canada.\n\nShortly after World War II FitzJohn established a sales unit in Mexico City. Mexico proved to be a fertile market for the company, and 40-passenger Super Duraliners were sold there until 1956, many built to an unusual rear-entrance/exit configuration. Although sales dropped in the mid-1950s when the Mexican government began to encourage domestic manufacturing, over 50 Roadrunners were exported. Following the dissolution of FitzJohn, a Mexican company began building the Roadrunner.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Gim clan of Gyeongju. He used various Ho (pen-names): Wandang (阮堂), Chusa (秋史), Yedang (禮堂), Siam (詩庵), Gwapa (果坡), Nogwa (老果) etc. (some 200 in all). He is especially celebrated for having transformed Korean epigraphy and for having created the “Chusa-che” (秋史體 Chusa writing style) inspired by his study of ancient Korean and Chinese epitaphs. His ink paintings, especially of orchids, are equally admired.\n\nAs a scholar, he belonged to the Silhak (Practical Learning) school also known as the Bukhak (北學, “Northern Learning”). He was related to Queen Jeongsun, the second wife of King Yeongjo, and by his adoptive mother, Nam Yang-hong, he was a cousin to Namyeon-gun Yi Gu, who was destined to be the grandfather of King Gojong (高宗, later titled 光武帝 Gwangmu Emperor. 1852–1919). Hongseon Daewon-gun (興宣大院君, 1820–1898), King Gojong’s father, who served as his regent and was also a noted calligrapher, was one of Gim’s pupils for a while.\n\nGim was born in the family home in Yesan, now South Chungcheong Province, in 1786. He was the eldest son. His birth father was Gim No-gyeong (金魯敬, 1766 - 1840); his grandfather was Gim I-ju (金頤柱, ? – 1797) and his great-grandfather was Weolseongui Gim Han-sin (月城尉 金漢藎, 1720–1758) who married the second daughter of King Yeongjo, the Princess Hwasun (和順翁主, 1720 - 1758). His ancestors and relatives held many high administrative positions and several were noted for their calligraphy. His mother was a member of the Gigye Yu clan, a daughter of Yu Jun-ju (兪駿柱), the governor of Gimhae.\n\nHe is reputed to have been a remarkable calligrapher already as a child. When he was 7, the famed scholar Chae Je-gong (蔡濟恭, 1720 - 1799) is said to have been impressed on seeing the “Ipchun Daegil Cheonha Daepyeongchun” (立春大吉 天下太平春) good-luck charm marking the coming of spring that he had written, pasted on the gate of the family home. From the age of 15 he received instruction from the celebrated Bukhak (北學, “Northern Learning)” scholar Pak Je-ga (朴齊家, 1750–1805).\n\nIn the 1790s, the head of the family, his eldest uncle, Gim No-yeong (金魯永, 1747–1707), was sent into exile, while another uncle as well as his grandparents all died in quick succession. It was decided that Gim Jeong-hui should be adopted by Gim No-yeong (who had several daughters but no son) and so become the next head of the family. When he was 15, in 1800, he married a member of the Hansan Yi clan (閑山李氏). That same year, King Jeongjo died and Queen Jeongsun, the widow of the previous King Yeongjo, became regent, since the new king was only a child. Gim Jeong-hui's birth father benefitted from the family's relationship with the regent and was raised to a high rank.\n\nGim Jeong-hui's birth mother died in 1801, aged only 34. Queen Jeongsun died in 1805, and Gim Jeong-hui's young wife died only a few weeks after her. His teacher Pak Je-ga also died that year and these multiple deaths seem to have encouraged his already deep interest in Buddhism as a source of consolation and meaning. His adoptive mother also died at around this time and once mourning for her was over, he married a slightly younger second wife in 1808, a member of the Yean Yi clan (禮安 李氏). In 1809 he took first place in the lower Gwageo civil examination.\n\nIn 1810, his adoptive father was appointed a vice-envoy in the annual embassy to Qing China and he accompanied him, spending some 6 months in China. There he met such noted scholars as Weng Fanggang (翁方綱, 1733–1818) and Ruan Yuan (阮元, 1764–1849) who recognized his qualities. He seems to have studied documentary history there especially. Ruan Yuan gave him a copy of his “Su Zhai Biji” (蘇齋筆記), a book about calligraphy, and Gim continued to correspond with them after his return to Korea. For a time after returning home he did not take up any official position but continued to study the Northern Learning and write essays criticizing rigid Neo-Confucianism.\n\nHe also pursued research by visiting and studying the inscriptions on ancient stele. In 1815, the Venerable Cho-ui first visited Seoul and met Gim Jeong-hui there. This was the beginning of a deep and lasting relationship. Perhaps it was from this time that Gim began to drink tea, there is no knowing.\n\nPassing the Gwageo national exam held to mark an eclipse year in 1819, he rose to such positions as secret inspector and tutor to the Crown Prince. Following the death of the prince, power passed to the conservative Gim clan of Andong and Gim was reduced in rank while his adoptive father was exiled for several years, until 1834. In 1835, after the accession of King Heonjong, the family's fortunes turned and Gim Jeong-hui rose to ministerial rank. In the same year he visited the Ven. Cho-ui at Daedun-sa temple (大芚寺), now called Daeheung-sa).\n\nFollowing the death of King Sunjo of Joseon (r. 1800-1834) late in 1834, Queen Sunwon, the wife of Sunjo and a member of the Gim clan of Andong, held immense power after her grandson, Heonjong (憲宗, 1827–1849 ), still only a child, was made king. Queen Gim acted as his regent. Factional in-fighting increased and in 1840, when he was due to be a member of the Chinese embassy, Gim Jeong-hui was instead condemned to exile in Jeju Island. Late in 1842 his wife died. He was finally allowed to return home early in 1849. It was during those years in exile that he developed the calligraphic style known as the “Chusa style,” based on his studies of models dating back to the earliest periods of Korean and Chinese history. On his way into exile and on his way back home afterward, he visited the Venerable Cho-ui in his Ilchi-am hermitage at what is now known as Daeheung-sa temple. Cho-ui consecrated several of his building projects in the temple to helping sustain Gim during his exile and visited him in Jeju-do 5-6 times, bringing him gifts of tea. .\n\nIn 1844, during his exile in Jeju Island, he produced his most celebrated ink painting, usually known as “Sehando” or “Wandang Sehando” (阮堂歲寒圖, ‘Wandang’ was one of Gim's most frequently used ‘Ho’ names; ‘Sehan’ means ‘the bitter cold around the lunar new year,’ ‘do’ means ‘painting’), which he gave to his disciple Yi Sang-jeok (李尙迪, 1804–1865) in gratitude for his friendship, which included bringing him precious books from China. The painting shows a simple house, barely outlined, framed by two gnarled pine trees. Beside it there are texts expressing gratitude to Yi Sang-jeok. Yi was an outstanding figure, a poet and calligrapher who went 12 times to China and was greatly admired by the scholars he met there. In 1845, Yi returned to China with the painting, which he showed to the scholars he met. Sixteen of them composed appreciatiative colophons which were attached to the left side of the painting, creating a lengthy scroll. After Yi's return to Korea, some Korean scholars also added their tributes, creating a unique cumulative work combining painting, poetic writing and calligraphy.\n\nSoon after King Heonjong in 1849, there were disputes over the relocation of his tomb, in which a friend of Gim Jeong-hui, Gwon Don-in, was involved. as a result, both were sent into exile, Gim spending the years 1850-2 in Bukcheong, Hamgyeong-do province, far in the North.\n\nAfter the northern exile, he settled in Gwacheon (to the south of Seoul, where his birth father was buried) in a house he called Gwaji Chodang (瓜地草堂). In 1856 he went to stay for a while in Bongeun-sa temple, in what is now Seoul's Gangnam area, and is said to have become a monk. Later that same year he returned to his home in Gwacheon, and continued to write until the day before he died.\n\nIn the years following his death, his disciple Nam Byeong-gil (南秉吉) and others prepared and published collections of his letters (\"Wandang Cheokdok\" 阮堂尺牘) and of his poems (\"Damyeon Jaesigo\" 覃糧齋詩藁) in 1867; a collection of his other writings (\"Wandangjip\" 阮堂集) was published in 1868. A complete edition of his works, (\"Wandang Seonsaeng Jeonjip\" 阮堂先生全集), was published by his great-great-grandson Gim Ik-hwan (金翊煥) in 1934.\n\nThe influence of Gim Jeong-hui among the Korean scholars of the later 19th century was immense. He was reputed to have taught 3,000 of them and was seen as the leader of a modernizing trend that developed into the Gaehwapa Enlightenment Party at the end of the 19th century. Among the names associated with him we find Shin Wi (申緯, 1769–1845), O Gyeong-seok (吳慶錫, 1831–1879), Min Tae-ho (閔台鎬, 1834–1884), Min Gyu-ho (閔奎鎬, 1836–1878), Gang Wi (姜瑋, 1820–1884).\n\nHis main scholarly interest was in documentary history and monumental inscriptions. He maintained correspondence on these topics with major scholars in China. He was particularly celebrated for having deciphered and identified the stele on Mount Bukhan commemorating a visit by King Jinheung of Silla (540–576). He is remembered for his outstanding achievements in calligraphy, ink painting, as well as his writings in prose and poetry. He was in the habit of devising a special Ho (pen-name) for himself whenever he dedicated a painting of orchids to an acquaintance, so that he became the person of his generation with the most such names.\n\nIt seems that Gim Jeong-hui was accustomed to frequenting Buddhist temples from his childhood onward. There are indications that the sudden death in or around 1805 of several of those he had been close to drove him to deepen his Buddhist practice. Among his calligraphic work, a number of copies of Buddhist Sūtras and other texts survive and he wrote name boards for halls in Daeheung-sa, Bongeun-sa and other temples. The reformists of the Practical Learning tradition often showed an interest in either Catholicism or Buddhism, as part of their reaction against the rigidly secular Neo-Confucianist philosophy.\n\nHe was especially close to the Ven. Cho-ui Seonsa (草衣禪師, Uiseon (意恂, 1786–1866) and Baekpa Daesa (白坡大師, Geungseon 亘璇, 1767–1852).\n\nIn 1815, Cho-ui first visited Seoul and established strong relationships with a number of highly educated scholar-officials, several of whom had been to China, who became his friends and followers. These included the son-in-law of King Jeongjo (正祖 r. 1776-1800), Haegeo-doin Hong Hyeon-Ju 海居 道人 洪顯周 (1793–1865) and his brother Yeoncheon Hong Seok-Ju 淵泉 洪奭周 (1774–1842), the son of Dasan Jeong Yak-yong, Unpo Jeong Hak-Yu 耘逋 丁學游 (1786–1855), as well as Gim Jeong-Hui and his brothers Sanchon Gim Myeong-hui 山泉 金命喜 (1788–1857) and Geummi Gim Sang-hu 琴糜 金相喜 (1794–1861). It was most unusual for a Buddhist monk, who as such was assigned the lowest rank in society, to be recognized as a poet and thinker in this way by members of the Confucian establishment. As a monk, Cho-ui was not allowed to enter the city walls of Seoul and had to receive visits from these scholars while living in Cheongnyangsa temple 淸涼寺 outside the capital's eastern gate or in a hermitage in the hills to the north.\n\nGim Jeong-Hui had initiated a controversy with the other celebrated Seon Master Baekpa Geungseon (白坡 亘璇, 1767–1852) who had written the \"Seonmun sugyeong\" (禪文手鏡 Hand Glass of Seon Literature). In his \"Baekpa Mangjeungsipojo\" (白坡 妄證十五條 Fifteen Signs of Baekpa's Senility), Gim wrote, “The truth of Seon is like a light new dress without stitching, just like a heavenly dress. But the dress is patched and repatched by the inventiveness of humans, and so becomes a wornout piece of clothing.” Baekpa had written that certain traditions were superior to others, and Gim considered such quibbles to be a waste of time as well as a misunderstanding of the nature of Seon. Nonetheless, when Baekpa died at Hwaeom-sa Temple in 1852, Gim wrote an epitaph for him: 華嚴宗主白坡大律師大機大用之碑.[6]\n\nThere are no extended studies or resources devoted to Gim Jeong-Hui in English.\nThe single most extensive Internet site in Korean devoted exclusively to Gim Jeong-hui www.chusa.or.kr has been established under the auspices of the Gwacheon local government.\nThe Moam Collection owns the largest number of works by Gim Jeong-hui and the Moam Collection home page includes a Gallery with images of many works.\nThere is an extended page in Korean devoted to him in the Academy of Korean Studies own pages.\nAnother online resource in Korean about Gim Jeong-hui is the page about him in the EncyKorea (also a resource administered by the AKS).

{"id": "1838352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838352", "title": "Great Pyramid of Cholula", "text": "Great Pyramid of Cholula\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Cholula, also known as (Nahuatl for \"made-by-hand mountain\"), is a huge complex located in Cholula, Puebla, Mexico. It is the largest archaeological site of a pyramid (temple) in the New World, as well as the largest pyramid by volume known to exist in the world today. The pyramid stands above the surrounding plain, and in its final form it measured \n. The pyramid is a temple that traditionally has been viewed as having been dedicated to the god Quetzalcoatl. The architectural style of the building was linked closely to that of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico, although influence from the Gulf Coast also is evident, especially from El Tajín.\n\nThe Cholula archaeological zone is situated west of the city of Puebla, in the city of Cholula. The pyramid is located in the San Andrés Cholula, Puebla municipality, and marks the area in the center of the city where this municipality begins. The city is divided into two municipalities called San Andrés and San Pedro. This division originates in the Toltec-Chichimeca conquest of the city in the twelfth century. These pushed the former dominant ethnicity of the Olmeca-Xicalanca, to the south of the city. These people kept the pyramid as their primary religious center, but the newly dominant Toltec-Chichimecas founded a new temple to Quetzalcoatl where the San Gabriel monastery is now.The Toltec-Chichimec people who settled in the area around the twelfth century AD named Cholula as \"Tlachihualtepetl\", meaning \"artificial hill\".\n\nThe name \"cholula\" has its origin in the ancient Nahuatl word \"cholollan\", which means \"place of refuge\".\n\nThe Great Pyramid was an important religious and mythical centre in prehispanic times. Over a period of a thousand years prior to the Spanish Conquest, consecutive construction phases gradually built up the bulk of the pyramid until it became the largest in Mexico by volume.\n\nThe temple-pyramid complex was built in four stages, starting from the 3rd century BC through the 9th century AD, and was dedicated to the deity Quetzalcoatl. It has a base of and a height of 66 m (217 ft). According to the \"Guinness Book of Records,\" it is in fact the largest pyramid as well as the largest monument ever constructed anywhere in the world, with a total volume estimated at over 4.45 million cubic metres, even larger than that of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which is about 2.5 million cubic metres. However the Great Pyramid of Giza is higher at . The ceramics of Cholula were closely linked to those of Teotihuacan, and both sites appeared to decline simultaneously. The Postclassic Aztecs believed that Xelhua built the Great Pyramid of Cholula.\n\nAt its peak, Cholula had the second largest population in Mexico of an estimated 100,000 people living at this site. Though the prehispanic city of Cholula remained inhabited, residents abandoned the Great Pyramid in the 8th century as the city suffered a drastic population drop. Even after this population drop, the Great Pyramid retained its religious importance.\n\nThe site was once called Acholollan (in Nahuatl) meaning place of flight. This meaning has led some to believe that this site was founded after its original inhabitants fled elsewhere.\n\nThe \"Toltec-Chichimec History\", a codex from the Cholula region, relates that an Olmec-Xicalanca lord with the title \"Aquiyach Amapane\" resided at the Great Pyramid. In the 12th century, after the Toltec-Chichimecas took over the city, religious focus shifted away from the pyramid and to a new temple. Even during the Postclassic period, long after locals abandoned the pyramid, they continued to bury their deceased around the structure, demonstrating its continued importance. By the time the Spanish arrived, the pyramid was overgrown, and by the 19th century it was still undisturbed, with only the church built in the 16th century visible.\n\nArchitect Ignacio Marquina started exploratory tunnelling within the pyramid in 1931. By 1954, the total length of tunnels came to approximately .\n\nToday the pyramid at first looks like a natural hill surmounted by a church. This is the \"Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de los Remedios\" (Church of Our Lady of Remedies), also known as the \"Santuario de la Virgen de los Remedios\" (Sanctuary of the Virgin of Remedies), which was built by the Spanish in colonial times (1594) on top of the prehispanic temple. The church is a major Catholic pilgrimage destination, and the site is also used for the celebration of indigenous rites. Many ancient sites in Latin America are found under modern Catholic holy sites, due to the practice of the Catholic Church of repurposing local religious sites.\n\nBecause of the historic and religious significance of the church, which is a designated colonial monument, the pyramid as a whole has not been excavated and restored, as have the smaller but better-known pyramids at Teotihuacan. Inside the pyramid are some five miles (8 km) of tunnels excavated by archaeologists.\n\nThe pyramid consists of six superimposed structures, one for each ethnic group that dominated it. However, only three have been studied in any depth. The pyramid itself is just a small part of the greater archaeological zone of Cholula, which is estimated at . Building of the pyramid began in the Preclassic Period and over time was built over six times to its final dimensions of 450 metres on each side at the base and 66 metres tall. The base covers a total area of 160,000 square meters, making it three times greater than the 53,056.5 square meter base of Pharaoh Khufu's Great Pyramid of Giza. Tlachihualtepetl has the largest pyramid base in the Americas. The earliest construction phase features talud-tablero architecture that is characteristic of the region, and that became strongly associated with the great metropolis of Teotihuacan. Some of the pyramid constructions have had burials, with skeletons found in various positions, with many offerings, especially ceramics. The last state of construction has stairs on the west side leading to a temple on top, which faced Iztaccíhuatl. During the colonial period, the pyramid was severely damaged on its north side to build the Camino Real to Puebla. The west was damaged later with the installation of a rail line.\n\nThe first study of the pyramid area was done by Adolph Bandelier, a Swiss-born American archaeologist with an interest in Mexico. He arrived at Cholula in 1881 and published his findings about the site in 1884. Most of Bandelier's work involved the unearthing of various burials in the area around the pyramid, principally collecting skulls, which was standard practice at the time. Many of these wound up in storerooms in U.S. museums.\n\nBandelier also took the first precise measurements of the structure, made some headway into how it was constructed and worked on domestic structures that coincide with the pyramid. Bandelier was also the first to make precise field notes at the site and the earliest plan of the site. Bandelier also showed interest in two nearby mounds called the Cerro de Acozac and the Cerro de la Cruz, which at that time were totally covered in vegetation.\n\nThe pyramid was excavated in two phases. The first began in 1931 and ended in the 1950s. Excavations began again in 1966 and officially ended in 1970, with the publication of the reports of the various academics who worked on Proyecto Cholula.\n\nExploration of the pyramid itself began in 1931 under architect Ignacio Marquina who dug tunnels to explore the substructures. This was a time of political instability in Mexico, mostly due to the Cristero War. However, the decision was made to excavate the structure because of the success of the excavations of Teotihuacan by Manuel Gamio in the 1920s. The project was given to Marquina because of his experience working with Gamio in Teotihuacan.\n\nWhile credit is given to Marquina, he spent little time at the site. Most of the work was really done by Marino Gómez, the site guardian, who directed the digging of the tunnels. These tunnels allowed for the mapping and modelling of the pyramid's successive layers. The pyramid had no obvious entrance, due to its deteriorated condition, but the archaeologists decided to begin tunnelling on the north side, where colonial construction had damaged it. On this side, the remains of walls and other structures could be seen.\n\nTunnelling techniques were based on various team members' experience at Teotihuacan and Tenayuca. These techniques were based on mining, even using small tracks and miniature coal cars to carry out debris. Examples of these are at the site museum. The base of the pyramid was constructed of sun-dried adobe bricks, which contained ceramic, obsidian and gravel for better compacting. This solid foundation allowed the excavators to only need to create \"false arches,\" like those found in Mayan constructions, rather than adding beams and other supports.\n\nThe first two tunnels were built to cris-cross the centre, one north/south and the other east/west.When the tunnels reached substructure, they then followed the contour of the structure, and eventually the various tunnels created an underground labyrinth. By 1939, there were four kilometers of tunnels, with two more added by 1951. The tunnels demonstrate the real value of the pyramid, which is not visible on the surface.\n\nDuring the first round of excavations, sixteen holes were dug in the area by Eduardo Noguera to extract ceramic materials and establish a time line. The results of these were published in 1954 as \"La ceramic arqueológica de Cholula\". The pieces ranged from clay figures made when the settlement was just a village, to the Pre-classic. The latter ones include figures that are definitely nude females with complicated hair styles. Figures from later periods, such as those coinciding with Tula and Teotihuacan, tend to be of gods and priests. Various musical instruments, such as flutes, were also found, as well as tools for the making of textiles, amate paper and axes. One major find included a ceremonial scepter carved from bone, with images related to the concept of life and death as a duality.\n\nThe first round of excavation work ended in the 1950s. The second round of excavations took place from 1966 to 1974 under the name of Proyecto Cholula. This was spurred, in part, by reconstructed pyramids in Mexico, which had become tourist attractions. This project was sponsored by both the federal and state governments, who wanted to make Cholula an attraction, as well. The archaeology and anthropology fields had experienced changes since Marquina's work, mostly focusing on a more interdisciplinary approach.\n\nThe first person in charge of the site was Miguel Messmacher in 1966. After only six months of work, Messmacher released a preliminary report in 1967. One of the main finds during this time was that of Edificio I (Building I). In addition to the excavating of the main structures of the pyramid, Messmacher, Eduardo Matos Moctezuma and others in the project worked on more multidisciplinary tasks, such as determining agricultural patterns of the site, ceramic development and water distribution systems. However, this put them in conflict with the sponsors of the project, along with the INAH, which favored a more restricted approach that focused on reconstructing the pyramid.\n\nIn 1967, INAH decided to replace Messmacher with Ignacio Marquina as head of the team excavating the site, which prompted most of the younger researchers to leave the project. While the focus was placed back on the pyramid proper, the project did not lose all of its interdisciplinary character, keeping experts in areas such as geology, botany and paleozoology.\n\nThe project began to focus on the south side of the pyramid, excavating the remains of plazas and buildings that made up a large complex. However, it was difficult to link these structures to those in the interior of the pyramid. The patios were unearthed in layers as far back as the Classic period (200 to 800 AD) and the beginnings of the Post-classic, during the occupation of the Olmecas Xicallancas. These structures were later reconstructed. The most important elements unearthed during this time were the Courtyard of the Altars and Edificio F (Building F). By the official end of the project in 1974, interest in the pyramid waned again as it could not be reconstructed in its entirety, like other major pyramids in Mexico. The project was abandoned, leaving only fragmentary knowledge about it.\n\nDespite the site's pre-Hispanic importance, this pyramid is relatively unknown and unstudied, especially in comparison to others in Mexico such as Teotihuacan, Chichen Itza and Monte Albán. There are a number of possible reasons for this. One is that its existence was not greatly elaborated in a publication by the Mexican government for the 1928 Congreso Internacional de Americanistas in New York. There is only one short mention of the pyramid in the entire work. However, by this time, only Bandelier had done any work on the site.\n\nOf all the work done from the 1930s to the 1950s, there was only one presentation, at the XXVII Congreso Internacional de Americanistas de México in 1939. In 1951, Marquina included Cholula in a work called \"Arqutectura prehispánica\" along with information from the various major sites of the country. However, interest waned in the Cholula site in the 1950s. One reason for this was that, at the time, it was common to reconstruct the major buildings, especially pyramids, even though these reconstructions were often exaggerated. No such reconstruction is possible with the Cholula pyramid.\n\nMost of the publications that do exist are technical field reports with few syntheses of data gathered. For this reason, it has not played a significant role in the understanding of Mesoamerica as to date. Due to the condition of the surface and the large number of artifacts just under the surface, it is not possible to reconstruct the last stage of the pyramid to what it was.\n\nExcavations have resulted in about eight kilometers of tunnels inside the pyramid, which began with two in 1931 to prove that the hill was an archeological find. Within, altars with offerings, floors, walls and buried human remains from around 900 AD were discovered. Today, only about 800 meters of these tunnels are open to the public, which have been made into well-lit, arched passages. Visitors enter on the north side, through the center of the pyramid and exit on the south side. There are few signs explaining the structures within, but in one section allows a view of main staircases of one of the pyramids, whose nine floors have been excavated from bottom to top. There are also two famous murals. One is called \"Chapulines,\" which consists of images of grasshoppers with a black skull in the middle. And the other is the \"Bebedores,\" which depicts various figures drinking out of vessels most commonly used for pulque. Around the pyramid are a number of other structures and patios, which form a massive complex.The Patio of the Altars was the main access to the pyramid and is named for the various altars that surround a main courtyard.\n\nInitial excavations eventually indicated that the main access to the pyramid was on the west side, which latter excavations confirmed. Both also showed that there usually were minor accesses on the northeast and southwest corners.\n\nBuilding A is the earliest version of the pyramid also called \"La Conejera.\" This structure was discovered in the 1950s, near the end of the first round of excavations. It is a pre-Teotihuacan structure, relatively simple with an adobe core. However, it was not found directly under the other layers of the Pyramid, but rather under a structure known as the Edificio Rojo (Red Building) in the northeast corner. This makes the oldest pyramid of the site \"off-center\" in relation to the later pyramids. It was built with an adobe core with a base of about ten meters square. It has a wall in talud topped with a 57 cm cornice. Over this, a two story chamber faced south. One side of La Conejera, eight rounded steps made of earth with a stone core lead to the west side of the structure, into a hallway. This bears some resemblance to the rounded pyramid of Cuicuilco. From the ceramics found with it, the structure has been dated to about 200 BC, contemporary with sites such as Zacatenco and El Arbolillo in the Valley of Mexico. La Conejera's base, cornice and chamber were all painted. Black paint remains on the base. The cornice on the northwest corner had white squares painted over a black background. Investigators have assumed that this pattern was repeated over the rest of the cornice. Both the outer and inner walls of the chamber were painted red several times with no designs.\n\nBuilding B or the Pyramid of the Painted Skulls was centered in a spot a few meters from La Conejera. Later expansions of this pyramid eventually covered La Conejera and the Edificio Rojo built over it. The Pyramid of the Painted Skulls was built between 200 and 350 AD, consisting of seven stepped levels with an adobe nucleus. It was finished with adobe and rock, and smoothed with earth mixed with lime to create a painting surface. The architecture is significant because of its talud-tablero structure, and its mural-decorated walls. This structure was constructed in two phases. The first created a rectangular platform 113 meters by 107 meters. On top of this is a two story structure, eighteen meters high with stairs on the west. This structure is made of adobe bricks, which stone and clay used in the areas with stairs. Marquina determined that this structure had an east-west orientation, similar to the Pyramid of the Sun, coinciding with the Teotihuacan civilization, and later ceramic studies placed it with Teotihuacan II. Only the murals of the upper two stories of this pyramid have been studied, on the taluds and tableros of the north side as well as those on the northeast corner. The talud has traces of black and the two meter tableros consist of a frieze measuring 46 cm wide with a double frame or border that juts out from the frieze. This is characteristic of Cholula architecture. These tableros usually have one color as the base, but with stripes of other colors on top, such as yellow, red and blue. The north side is completely free of paint on the left side, but on the right, there are pockets of color remaining. The highest story contains nine skulls painted on it, which the lower one had seven. These skulls were initially thought to be the heads of grasshoppers facing forward, but later studies determined that they depict highly stylized human skulls. These skulls look forward and are painted yellow and red over a black background. Above the skulls are decorative markers that look like arrows, which indicate the direction of the scene. Those on the left side point east, and those on the right point west. To the sides are stylized wings in red, green and ochre.\n\nOne of the most important discoveries between 1932 and 1936 was the Altar of the Sculpted Skulls, which was officially reported by archeologist Eduardo Noguera in 1937. This building is located in one of the lower levels of the northeast patio area, attached to the base of the Pyramid of the Painted Skulls. The architectural aspects of this altar, however, correspond to the Post classic period. The altar sits on a platform and faces east, in front of which are stairs to climb the platform. For this reason, it is considered a momeztli type of altar, which are placed on ceremonial platforms. It has a square base with its north, south, and west sides done in talud that rise up to a decorated section that is topped with a cornice. The access stairs have parallel beams that culminate in dados – an element found in Tenayuca and other Mexica areas. The name comes from the three human skulls made from clay, with bulging eyes and covered in stucco, along with the rest of the structure. This ornamental feature relates to the function of the altar, which is believed to be a mausoleum. It contains the remains of a man and woman. The female skeleton is accompanied by grave goods related to domestic life such as comals, bone needles, spindles, and pots. The male skeleton probably belonged to a renowned warrior. His grave goods are far richer, with ritual vessels, and elegant vase with a multicolored design, obsidian arrowheads, and a musical instrument called an omexicahuaztli. A jawbone of a xoloitzcuintle dog was also found. Pre-Hispanic people considered dogs guides to the underworld. The function of this mausoleum was mostly likely to perpetuate the memory of the male warrior. It has two levels. One is a pyramidal platform and the other is a talud-tablero structure with a double cornice and crest in adobe, decorated with interlocked designs in low relief painted red, yellow and green. The talud is painted black as well as the bottom part of the tablero, with some minor details in ochre. The north side only shows the jaw and eye of a skull and some of the arrow and other effects seen on the pyramid it is associated with. The west side contains two skulls. One conserves about half of the original to see its open mouth and white teeth. The figure is outlined in ochre and black. The other skull contains only traces of these colors. The lower cornice on the north side is divided by horizontal bands, black above and red below. The interior cornice has double bands of green and red. To the extreme west of the painting, there are skull designs.\n\nBuilding C or the Pyramid of the Nine Stories, was built over Building B between 350 and 450 AD, and is bigger by volume than the Pyramid of the Moon at Teotihuacan. This latter phase was a radial pyramid, with stairways climbing all four sides of the structure. The Pyramid of the Nine Stories was built over the oldest structure using adobe again for expansion to a pyramid with a base of 190 meters squared and a height of 34 meters. Instead of a surface of earth and lime, this pyramid was finished with rock and stucco, which is more durable. Its architectural style is distinct from the one before. It consists of nine stories with talud only, covered in stucco. Each story above is smaller than below, leaving a space of two meters. The entrance stairs were those on the southeast corner, with those on the other three serving as exits. These walls were painted black with the stucco serving as white. Associated with the Stepped Pyramid is the Jaguar Altar, which is located on the southeast corner. The west and south sides of the altar's two levels have been explored. There is evidence that this altar was covered in decoration. On the west side of the first level, there is evidence of black, red, green and ochre paint. On the lower part of the south wall, there are fragments of red, black and ochre. Above this, there is a well conserved section of 3.15 m by 53 cm, with a black and green background with red stripes. There are also the profiles of a jaguar and two serpents. (chapter 4 135)\n\nThe final phase covered Building C, burying it within its adobe core. The facing of this phase has collapsed to give the impression of a natural hill.\n\nMarquina's first publication about the site in 1939 notes the existence of a Northeast Plaza, which was an unusual find at the time. This plaza contains three pyramid shaped structures in talud-tablero but in extremely poor condition. However, one important find about them was that their bases where painted with black square, vaguely resembling the niches of El Tajín.\n\nThe Courtyard of Altars is a complex of buildings adjoining the south side of the pyramid. It was one of the most important finds of the 1967 to 1970s round of excavation, named such because of several altars found here. Eduardo Matos Moctezuma had begun to touch on this area with his excavation of Edifico I in 1966 and 1967. The structure consists of a very large open area measuring seventy by fifty four meters, bordered by the pyramid proper to the north, and on the east and west sides by two complicated raised platforms, named Patio Sureste and Gran Plaza Suroeste by the excavators. These platforms are similar to those in the Northeast plaza, but they are up against the side of the main pyramid, which was done to amplify the patio's hierarchical and ritual nature. The area was mostly likely used for large, spectacular ceremonies as well as for rites associated with the passing of power. The taluds are wide, which is characteristic of Cholula, and decorated with moldings consisting of T formations. The tableros were painted with aquatic symbols and bands of red, blue, yellow and black. The access to the two main platforms and the side of the pyramid are marked by wide stairs.The Gran Plaza Suroeste shows strong Teotihuacan influence, with four rooms over taluds that surround a patio. One of these rooms contains a model of a pyramid base that may represent the Gran Pyramid in miniature. Excavations have revealed that these annexes were built up in a series of at least six construction phases, enclosing a central courtyard. As new phases of construction took place, newer versions of buildings were built over the pre-existing version, covering the lower part and adding a new or modified facade, resulting in the reduction of the courtyard area by the gradual encroachment of the surrounding structures and added several metres to the original platform height. These are buildings were arranged on the east and west sides of an early wide platform. Further structures were built against the rear facades of these buildings, forming two wide side plazas. The buildings that can be seen today date to the latest construction phase of the courtyard. Buildings on this south side contain significant mural work, including patterns on the various constructions associated with Building 3 (Building 3-1-A, Building 3-2, etc.). It also includes the only mural with anthropomorphic figures, called the Mural of the Drinkers.\n\nStructure 4 is decorated with T-shaped frets upon its sloping \"taluds\". Some sections of this decoration still display original colouring, with diagonal bands of red, blue, yellow, black and turquoise. The decoration also includes symbols that may represent stars.\n\nFour altars were excavated from the final construction phase of the Courtyard of Altars. Three of these altars were decorated with low relief sculptu re, which has allowed for the recovery of some of the fragments of Cholula's history. The centre section of each altar was left blank but may originally have been painted with religious designs.\n\nAltar 1 consists of a large vertical stone measuring 3.85 meters in height and 2.12 in width. When it was found, it was in twenty-two pieces. It is known that it was found in situ looking west although its offerings had long since been looted. Shortly after, its base was found. Its purpose is not clear as there are few decorative features, leading some to speculate that it was painted. New studies show similarities between this stone and decorative elements at El Tajín.\n\nAltar 2 is a more traditional ritual monument for Mesoamerica and fits the altar genre. It is a narrow rectangular stone, oriented to the east, in a horizontal position. It functioned as a kind of pedestal, with each of the sides richly ornamented. On one side, there are two feathered serpents extending along the length.\n\nAltar 3 may have been the most important as it is next to the pyramid. It faces south and is similar to Altar 1 as it is a vertical stone. Its shape is that of a rectangle topped by a triangle. Its decoration consists of a lateral band with relieves similar to those of Altar One, that is El Tajín style. When it was found, it was lying on a platform, which indicates something happened to the site, but it is not known what.\n\nOther large stone sculptures were found in the area. One is the head of a serpent with geometric designs that correspond to the Niuñe tradition in Oaxaca. There is also a giant human head, with the edges of its eyes and mouth marked in a way that resembles Xipe, which could correspond to a post-Olmec tradition, as similar figures were found in Tlaxcala.\n\nPainting and mural work was found on various levels of the main pyramid, on the Edificio Rojo, the La Conejera, the Pyramid of the Painted Skulls, the Altar of the Painted Skulls, the Stepped Pyramid, the Jaguar Altar, Edificio D and Edificio F. Studies of the various mural fragments found so far in the pre-Hispanic city of Cholula have reflected the political, economic and social changes over time. They also help to ascertain Cholula's relevance with the rest of Mesoamerica. There have been twenty one painted areas discovered by archaeologists, with eight mostly lost and thirteen still existing in situ. Most of the works belong to the Classic period, excepting those in the Edificio Rojo, which are from the Pre classic. The way that taluds, tableros and other surfaces were painted show changes over time in colors used as representations. The oldest have no representations, just the color red, but after 200 AD, there appear new colors such as different tones of red, as well as green, ochre, blue, black, and brown. Human like figures, animals and geometric shapes begin to appear as well. However, the Mural of the Drinkers is the only preserved mural that depicts human figures. So far, all of the discovered murals have been on outside walls, with the exception of an area called Edificio D (Building D), which has its murals inside. This indicates that most murals were created for the public and probably to teach and reinforce the religious and political symbols of the time. The best conserved murals have been found on the layers inside the main pyramid and in the Courtyard of the Altars, the two most important areas of the site.\n\nThe Mural of Drinkers was discovered buried at a depth of almost and is one of the longest pre-Columbian murals found in Mexico, with a total length of . The building containing the Mural of the Drinkers was discovered accidentally in 1969 by Ponciano Salazar Ortegón while he was exploring Edificio 3-1-A. One of this building's taluds collapsed and exposed a portion of the mural behind it to view. Excavation of this building then continued until 1971. The building's main facade, which faces east towards the Courtyard of the Altars, contains the mural. This work also rescued one of the first foundations of Edificio 3. The foundation is formed by a frieze that measures ninety cm by 2.25 m in the best preserved areas. It was painted over a small talud only sixty cm long. It is possible there was a cornice here above it. The building corresponds to around 200 AD.\n\nThe subject of the mural is a feast, featuring personages drinking what is most likely pulque. Several of the displayed figures are wearing cloth turbans and \"maxtlatl\" sashes, and most of them wear zoomorphic masks. The figures sit in facing pairs, serving themselves from vessels placed between them. The subject of the mural is a ceremony where the participants appear relaxed as they realize various activities, which include drinking, making offerings, serving with one vomiting and one defecating. The figures are in vignettes along the strip of wall with the elements evenly distributed along its length. A number of the elements, such as the cups and jars, are associated with the drinking of pulque. It has been claimed by Florencia Muller that this mural is the oldest known representation of the ritual of the pulque gods.\n\nThe work has parts missing, but there is enough to discern three horizontal sections. The ones above and below are lines or borders framing the main central level containing the drinking figures. The mural divides into six \"walls\" (muros), which show differences in technique and content, most likely due to being the work of different artists. However, all relate to ritualistic drinking of pulque. These figures along the center are then divided into two sections by a blue band seen on walls 3, 4, 5 and 6. There is also evidence that the mural had been retouched several times. The mural contains 110 figures organized into pairs. The pairs are then separated by images of jars. Four can be identified as seated women and some of the figures appear to have wrinkles to depict age. Most of the men in the work are shown seated, facing front (but with faces in profile) with a bulging belly, with arms and legs in various positions, most with cups or other containers in hand to serve or to drink. There are a total of 168 jars, cups and other containers in the mural of various sizes and colors. There is also a depiction of an insect and two of dogs. The people are outlined in black, along with a number of other images. Most have their skin painted in ochre, but some are brown, red or black. Traces of liquid is in white. Some have earrings done in red or blue. However, there are some differences in quality and technique in the work. Section Six is more masterfully done, with the people depicted in masks painted in red and black with some ochre. Dogs and jars with complex designs can also be seen. Scene One is more brusque with far fewer details, mostly done in ochre.\n\nOther buildings in this area such as the later levels of Building 3 and Building 4, also have mural work, but this mostly consists of geometric patterns, lines or bands and in some places, stars. Building 3-1-A was superimposed over the Mural of the Drinkers at a depth of six meters below the current level of the Courtyard of the Altars. The section where this mural work is found consists of a long talud, with a tablero with double moldings, similar to those in Buildings 2, 3, and 4. The mural occupies the tablero, which is topped by a double cornice. The design consists of diagonal bands of various colors such as red, green yellow and blue, outlined in black and white. Some sections contains stars. Building 3-1 was built over the second level of the building containing the Mural of the Drinkers, running north south, and facing northeast like the older structure. It is one of the oldest borders of the Plaza Sureste and only two sections have been explored. It is sixty meters long but only about thirty is exposed. The visible area divides into three sections, divided by stairways. The upper part of this building, where the stairs lead, has a low talud that supports a frieze topped by a cornice, which juts out. This building contains mural work on a tablero measuring 71 cm by 2.6 meters in length, but there is no evidence of painting on the talud. The first mural consists of horizontal bands in a reddish ochre and a hook like design in red surrounded by an ellipsis in the same tone over a black background. Others consist of diagonal bands of greens and reds bordered and connected by black lines simulating a woven mat, which has led to it being called the \"Petatillo\" (small palm frond mat). The lower areas have diagonal lines of various colors such as black, green, ochre and red with some lines in white. Some areas have red stars. Mural work on Buildings 3.2 and 4 are similar in their use of multicolored diagonal bands with stars painted in some areas.\n\nBuilding D is located on the south side of the Pyramid of the Nine Stories. It consists of pyramid like levels of talud-tablero topped with three moldings on the east and two on the west. The levels are rectangles with rounded corners, painted black on three sides with the east side in orange. The murals on the tableros have no figures on them and the cornices are painted black. The building was constructed over an area, whose interior is covered with stone pieces with red, ochre and green paint over black. This area was filled in because later constructions around it were putting pressure on it and it was in danger of collapse.\n\nBuilding I was unearthed during a brief period of six months at the beginning of the second round of excavation, mostly by Eduardo Matos Moctezuma and Pablo López Valdéz. This building is located on a platform affixed onto the southwest side of the pyramid. It has four means of access, common to momoztli and contained three burials. The ceramics found with these are similar to those found at the Altar of the Sculpted Skulls, dating the structure as late into Cholula's pre Hispanic period. These two finds show that while the pyramid was in process of abandonment, it had not lost its ritual character.\n\nBuilding F dates from the next to last building phase of the pyramid, between 500 and 700 AD. It is a stone stairway, consisting of three levels with large taluds facing west. The tableros are decorated with a motif that looks like a woven palm mat. This effect was created by sculpting stones, then placing them like a mosaic. For this reason, the structure is also referred to as the Piedra Laborada (Worked Stone) building. Using stone found from both the taluds and the tableros, the archeologists set about reconstructing this structure, using commercially made cement, leading to the structure being called the Tolteca pyramid, after the brand used. This pyramid has since been criticized for being overly reconstructed. The process yielded a large number of ceramics figurines and vessels, which were studied by Florence Müller and range from the Pre Classic to the Postclassic. It has also lost most of its coloration, with only fragments of red, ochre, white and black remaining. The best conserved fragments are on the first level on the south and north where paint was applied directly onto rock. However, it is still difficult to discern the skulls and snails, because they have severely deteriorated.\n\nDuring the course of excavations of the Great Pyramid over 400 human burials have been uncovered. Most of these burials date to the Postclassic Period, showing that the Great Pyramid was an important centre of worship well after its use as a temple was discontinued. These burials include a number of human sacrifices, as demonstrated by mangled body parts and skulls from decapitated victims.\n\nThe remains of eight individuals were found under the slab flooring of the Courtyard of Altars. These included the remains of a number of children that were deposited in ceramic pots. These children were (thought to have been) messengers to Tlaloc (the god of rain) due to the drought occurring at this site. The disarticulated remains of at least 46 individuals were found in the area of an altar in the centre of a plaza at the southwest corner of the pyramid. These remains included individuals of all ages and both sexes.\n\nThe pyramid remains important to modern Cholula as a religious site, an archeological site and a tourist attraction. The site receives about 220,000 visitors each year on average. Just before the arrival of the Spanish, the pyramid was considered sacred to a rain goddess called Chiconauhquiauhitl (Goddess of the Nine Rains). She was replaced with an image of the Virgin of the Remedies, keeping the 8 September date for the veneration of the old rain goddess but transferring it to this image of the Virgin Mary. The Spanish built a church to this image on top of the pyramid. This church was struck and damaged by lightning several times, which was attributed in the early colonial period to the old goddess. However the change allowed the pyramid to keep its sacred nature to this day. The Virgin of the Remedies is the patron of the city of Cholula, and there are two major annual events related to it and the pyramid. The first is 8 September, when thousands come to honor the image, starting on the night of the 7th, when people spend the night with small lanterns so they can greet the image early on the eighth. The other is called the \"Bajada\" when the image comes down the pyramid to visit the various neighborhoods of the city for two weeks in May and June. Closer to the pyramid's pre-Hispanic roots is the Quetzacoatl ritual, which is held each year on the spring equinox. This event can draw up to 20,000 visitors, leading authorities to restrict access to the exposed archeological ruins on the south side. The ritual is performed on the pyramid with poetry, indigenous dance and music and fireworks.\n\nThe pyramid site accounts for only six hectares of an archeological heritage site believed to extend over 154 hectares. However, 90 hectares of this land is privately owned, and there is resistance to major archeological exploration. Despite the ancient city's and pyramid's importance to the history of central Mexico, the pyramid has not been extensively studied and has not of yet played a significant role in the understanding of Mesoamerica.\n\nThe pyramid is the main tourist attraction in Cholula, receiving 496,518 visitors in 2017. Images of this church on top of the pyramid with Popocatepetl in the background is frequently used in Mexico's promotion of tourism. It is one of the better known destinations in central Mexico for foreign travelers. The attraction consists of three parts: the tunnels inside the pyramid, the complex on the south side and the site museum. About eight km of tunnels were dug into the pyramid by archaeologists but only 800 meters are open to the public. The tunnel entrance is on the north side and it goes through the center of the structure. This tour passes by the Mural of the Drinkers, which is one of the most famous aspects of the site. The structures on the south side are dominated by the Courtyard of the Altars. Separated from the site by the Camino Real road is the site museum, which contains a model of the pyramid's layers, a room dedicated to ceramics and other finds from the site and the recreation of two of the site's murals.\n\nThe pyramid's importance has led to a number of measures taken to protect it. The archaeological zone is patrolled by a police equestrian unit from the municipality of San Ándres. This to keep motor vehicles from damaging the site. Access to parts of the site is restricted during events such as the Quetzalcoatl Ritual. Certain large fireworks have been banned by the city and the Catholic Church because they cause serious vibrations in the pyramid's tunnels. Some of the land around the pyramid has been bought by authorities and made into soccer fields, and sown with flowers to create a buffer between the construction of homes and the pyramid.\n\n"}

It is the home field of the Asheville Tourists minor league baseball team. As befits the hilly city of Asheville, the ballpark sits on a section of level ground partway up one of the city's hills, providing a picturesque atmosphere. It is the one of the oldest minor-league park in regular use.\n\nThe ballpark was built in 1924 and was named after Asheville resident Lewis McCormick; it is one of the oldest minor-league stadiums still in regular use. Lights were installed for nighttime play prior to the 1930 season. Since then, it has been home to the various incarnations of the Asheville Tourists team, and also served as home field for the Asheville Blues of the Negro Southern League during the 1940s. The facility was renovated in 1959, and then rebuilt in concrete between the 1991 and 1992 seasons, replacing the largely wood structure which had developed a leaky roof. The 1992 ballpark kept a similar layout to the original McCormick Field. The facility included new expanded restrooms and larger concession stands. New clubhouses were built and lights erected as player and field enhancements. The height of the fence behind the cozy right field area, which was in the vicinity of just away from home plate, was more than tripled, as it now stands tall (nearly the same height as Fenway Park's \"Green Monster\").\n\nThe ballpark served as one of the settings for the 1988 film \"Bull Durham\".\n\nThe venue hosted the 2009 Big South Conference Baseball Tournament, won by Coastal Carolina.\n\nFarther up the hill, behind the left field area, is Asheville Memorial Stadium, a football and soccer facility.

{"id": "1838369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838369", "title": "Pacific General", "text": "Pacific General\n\nPacific General is a computer wargame depicting famous battles of the World War II Pacific campaigns. It was published by Strategic Simulations in 1997 using the same game engine of the earlier and successful \"Panzer General \"for Windows 95. It was re-released on GOG.com in May 2015.\n\n\"Pacific General \"(also known as \"PacGen\") is played on a hex map with icons representing aircraft, warships, tanks, and groups of soldiers. The turn-based style allows each player to strategize their next move. Combat involves various factors, like critical hits, surprise, and terrain. Particular attention is spent on naval warfare, where ships can sustain critical hits to ship systems and submarines can submerge to launch stealth attacks. The weather and time of day are also important factors to consider: darkness can obscure troop movements and rain can prevent airstrikes. Troops can sustain suppression from enemy fire, inhibiting their offensive and defensive abilities, and they can also entrench themselves, enhancing their defensive strength.\n\nPlayers win by amassing victory points that are gained by occupying specific objective hexes. The side with the most victory points is declared the winner. Like role-playing games, the player can upgrade or add units to his core force, with the unit's experience carrying on to the next battle. He also must be aware of each unit's fuel and ammunition levels, and also the fog of war, the collective vision of all units under his control.\n\nPrestige is the currency of the game. Prestige is gained by destroying enemy units and lost when a player buys or upgrades his units. Prestige is also available at the start of a new scenario before any combat begins.\n\nWhereas the first \"Panzer General\" targeted DOS, \"Pacific General\" was made for Windows. \"Pacific General\" utilize interface and share an underlying file system that differs from the original \"Panzer General\". Fans created a version of \"Pacific General\", based on its own DOS version, that borrows interface features from the original \"Panzer General\". Called \"Pacific Panzer General\" (PacPG), it includes all scenarios and campaigns from the original, as well as bugfixes.\n\nThe player can choose between the Allied and Axis sides in both real and hypothetical scenarios, like the Battle of Midway and Operation Downfall. Thirty-one countries are represented, including the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Soviet Union but only United States and Japan have campaign modes. Each nation has historical weapons available.\n\nThere are several types of unit categories: tanks, infantry, artillery, fighter aircraft, bombers, aircraft carriers, battleships, forts, etc. Infantry and towed weapons may have attached trucks or half-track transports and land units can be moved around the map on cargo ships or cargo planes. Most nations have several units in each category, and many are unique to each nation; the Japanese have kamikazes at their disposal. Each unit has specific entry dates to when they can be available to a player; the U.S. cannot field jet aircraft until the hypothetical invasion of Japan from late 1945 to 1946. Custom Equipment Rosters (referred to as \"E-Rosters\") have been made available for this game after initial release by third-party fan sites, increasing the number of units available for each nation as well as improved in-game graphics.\n\nThe battles are only approximate representations of historical battles, where only a fraction of the participating forces are included. An Allies (United States) campaign and an Axis (Japan) campaign are included, as well as several other scenarios. A campaign is composed of many scenarios strung together. Similar to other titles in SSI's \"General\" series of wargames, players may find themselves commanding forces in hypothetical scenarios if they are much more successful than real-life commanders. For example, if Japanese players attain impressive victories, such as capturing Port Moresby or winning Battle of Midway for Japan, it's possible to invade Australia, Hawaii or even San Francisco, victories that historical Japanese commanders didn't come close to imagining.\n\nThe player can also create custom scenarios and campaigns, and a battle generator is available. Multiple fan-sites exist offering downloads of additional scenarios and campaigns.\n\nThe additional user-built campaigns include several German, several American, one Chinese, one Japanese, one Soviet, one British and two Italian campaigns.\n\nLike earlier games in the \"General\" series, \"Pacific General\" sold at least 50,000 units by September 1997.\n\n\n"}

Dreams Come True was a fireworks display at Disneyland commemorating the 50th anniversary of the park. Described by director Steve Davison as an \"E ticket in the sky\", the show featured fireworks, lower level pyrotechnics, isopar flame effects, projection mapping, lasers, searchlights, and lighting set to the soundtracks of some of Disneyland's most famous rides and shows. It was created as a homage to Disneyland and Disney parks worldwide, its lands and attractions, and its continuing legacy.\n\nThe show was produced by Walt Disney Creative Entertainment, under direction of VP Parades and Spectaculars Steve Davison and fireworks designer Eric Tucker.\n\nThe show was offered seasonally since 2009, showing \"Remember... Dreams Come True\" from winter to spring, \"\" during the summer time, \"\" during the first week of July, \"Halloween Screams\" during Fall, and \"Believe... In Holiday Magic\" during December. To date, \"Remember...\" went on hiatus twice - the first time in late 2014 to make way for Disneyland's Diamond Celebration (and fireworks show \"Disneyland Forever)\", and on April 7, 2018 for Pixar Fest (and fireworks show \"Together Forever).\" The show returned on February 3, 2017, and September 7th, 2018, respectively. \n\nIn November 2018 it was announced that a new fireworks show based on Mickey and Minnie Mouse called \"\"Mickey's Mix Magic\"\" would open at Disneyland on January 18, 2019. On April 24, 2019, Disneyland announced that “Mickey’s Mix Magic” ended on June 6, 2019, with the 60th anniversary fireworks show, “Disneyland Forever”, returned on June 7, 2019. It is currently unknown whether “Remember... Dreams Come True” will ever return, or if has been retired for good.\n\n\nThe original announcement from the Disneyland Railroad is heard, as is the whistle and bell of DLRR #1, \"C.K. Holliday\". Then music from Main Street, U.S.A. such as Maple Leaf Rag and Main Street Electrical Parade is heard. The \"old world\" segment shows the Main Street Station, complete with American Flag bunting projected onto Sleeping Beauty Castle while one of the trains seems to leave from it. Then, Old Glory is projected while the stars start to move on it. In the \"new world\" section, not much happens in the way of projections until MSEP's closing fanfare plays and exploding multicolor stars emanate from the center of the castle.\n\n\nVoices\n\nMusic from Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room and the Indiana Jones Adventure are played. Now, the castle has very colorful projections of the Tiki Room with all the rooks and the Matterhorn being transformed into the Totem Poles while the birds are projected on the second and third stories of the castle. During the Indiana Jones segment, the eye of Mara is projected onto the Matterhorn and the snake room of Indiana Jones Adventure is projected onto the castle. Also, six jets of fire shoot from the sides of the castle during the segment.\n\n\n\nPlays music from The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean. The exterior of the Haunted Mansion is projected onto the castle followed by the stretching room portraits. During the \"Wicked Waltz,\" Madame Leota is projected floating around the castle as instruments are projected above her. At the end of the segment, Little Leota is projected as she says her \"Hurry back\" spiel.\n\nDuring the Pirates of the Caribbean segment, a skull is projected onto the castle and Matterhorn as flare fireworks are launched from the mountain's peak (however, since mid-2017, the effect has been removed from the Matterhorn and flares are now launched from atop the \"Alice in Wonderland\" show building). There is a \"cannon fight\" of diagonal fireworks between Fantasyland and Frontierland.\n\n\n\nPlays music from Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Rivers of America. During the Rivers of America scene, the Mark Twain Riverboat is projected on the castle steaming across it.\n\n\n\nNote: The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad portion of the show was removed in 2009 and moved right into the music for Critter Country, Fantasyland, and Toontown. The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad portion can be seen in \"Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland\".\n\nMusic and sounds from various rides in Critter Country, Fantasyland, and Mickey's Toontown are heard. Attractions featured include (in order) Splash Mountain, Peter Pan's Flight, Alice in Wonderland, Casey Jr. Circus Train, Mad Tea Party, Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin, Country Bear Vacation Hoedown, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, It's a Small World, and America Sings. \n\nThe segment starts with the Buzzards asking if we have found our \"Laughin' Place.\" Splash Mountain is projected onto the castle. From there, Peter Pan flies across it with the Darling children. The Mad Hatter and March Hare are then heard as colored bubbles are projected, followed by Casey Jr. chugging across. As Benny the Cab introduces the second half of the segment, saxons spin next to the castle and a spiral is projected onto it follwed by a barrage of rainbow colored lights dancing across it. Finally, the weasel says \"Pop goes the weasel\" and the segment ends with a door slamming shut and everything fades to darkness.\n\n\n\nPlays sound effects, narration, projections, and music from Space Mountain, Submarine Voyage, Autopia, Rocket Jets, PeopleMover, Adventure Thru Inner Space and Star Tours. \n\nMany Tomorrowland attractions and show scenes are projected onto the castle including the Rocket Jets, Submarine Voyage, Adventures Thru Inner Space, The Peoplemover, and Autopia. The main part of the segment is centered around Star Tours, with the logo being projected to start the scene. As the fanfare begins, we appear to go through Hyperspace and meet a few Tiefighters, however, mainly stars are projected onto the castle.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion is also provided by Julie Andrews. She tells the audience that Disneyland has grown to become the \"Happiest Place on Earth\". Tinker Bell returns to fly over the castle as a reprise of \"Wishes\" and \"When You Wish Upon A Star\" plays. The show ends in a cavalcade of fireworks as Andrews says \"Remember...Dreams Come True!\". \n\nAfter the show the song \"Remember When\" performed by LeAnn Rimes is played throughout the park. This song was the official song of the Happiest Homecoming on Earth, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Disneyland and Disney Parks worldwide. For Christmas in 2005, however, while Disneyland opted to continue with Remember... Dreams Come True for the 50th anniversary, the snowfall finale still returned and the song \"White Christmas\"; both from Believe... In Holiday Magic; would be played instead of \"Remember When\" by LeAnn Rimes with Julie Andrews commenting that the most special time for believing in dreams is during the holidays with family and friends.\n\n\nThe entire soundtrack to the show can be found on \"A Musical History of Disneyland\" and on \"The Official Album of the Disneyland Resort\". The soundtrack reappeared on the \"Official Album for the Year of a Million Dreams\" with new narration to coincide with the end of the 50th Anniversary. The score was arranged by Greg Smith.\n\nThis fireworks show was also used during the 2006 and 2007 Grad Nite programs - the show itself remained almost unchanged except for the soundtrack being replaced with one consisting primarily of contemporary music (different each year) and projection to match it. The show is renamed to Grad Nite Explosion for these events and runs for approximately 10 minutes at 1:00am and 3:00am. Video screens along with additional lighting effects are also added on either side of the hub (already in place as part of Club KIIS).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1838386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838386", "title": "Woodville-West Torrens Football Club", "text": "Woodville-West Torrens Football Club\n\nWoodville-West Torrens Football Club is an Australian rules football club playing in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). It was formed in 1990 from an amalgamation of the neighbouring Woodville and West Torrens football clubs and played its inaugural game in 1991. Since 1993, the Eagles have played most of their home games at Woodville's home ground of Woodville Oval, having previously used Football Park. They also play two or three games per season at their pre-season base of Thebarton Oval, a ground which has six light towers that the club has upgraded in 2012 to allow night games at the ground for the first time since the 1983 Escort Cup Grand Final (a game won by West Torrens).\n\nWest Torrens had competed in the SANFL since 1895, when it was originally known as the Natives and later the Eagles, while Woodville entered the competition in 1964, but both sides struggled on the field throughout their respective existences.\n\nTo 1990, West Torrens had won four premierships in eighty seven seasons, the last one being in 1953, and Woodville had not won a premiership or played in a grand final in twenty-seven seasons, usually being close to or on the bottom of the ladder. Whispers had grown throughout SA football circles that a merger would save these clubs throughout the 1980s.\n\nIn 1990, the imminent admission of the Adelaide Crows into the AFL placed both club's futures as separate entities in serious doubt: West Torrens was technically insolvent, \nwith debts of $1.1 million, and while Woodville was financially viable, club officials realised that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the club to be competitive in the foreseeable future.\n\nIt was decided at the end of the season to merge the two sides to form the Woodville-West Torrens Eagles. The club would play their home games at Woodville's home ground, Woodville Oval, and use the West Torrens Eagle emblem. The new club proved immediately competitive, and won their first premiership in 1993.\n\nAlthough officially formed in 1991, it was after the 1993 Premiership that many finally accepted the 'new' Eagles. In accepting the Thomas Seymour Hill Trophy for the first time for the Eagles (also the first time ever for Woodville, and the first time since 1953 for West Torrens), captain Peter Schwarz jubilantly proclaimed:\n\nThe club colours of blue, gold and green incorporate the club colours of West Torrens (blue and gold) and Woodville (green and gold). The Eagle logo of the West Torrens Football Club was adopted as the official emblem of Woodville West Torrens. It was also agreed that blue would be the primary colour of the merged club.\n\nWoodville-West Torrens entered a team in the SANFL Women's League in 2019.\n\nAfter having merged only 3 years prior, Woodville-West Torrens managed to claim the Holy Grail of SANFL footy, The Thomas Seymour Hill Trophy, after a convincing 73-point victory over Norwood. It would, however, prove to be the Eagles only premiership success during 1994–2005 in which they lost 5 Grand Finals – 1994 to Port Adelaide and 2000, 2001, 2004 and 2005 all to Central District. After losing yet another Grand Final to their arch rivals in 2005, the Eagles bounced back and got their first premiership in 13 years, and after 6 attempts, with a thumping 76-point victory over the Bulldogs. Prior to the game, the Eagles Cheersquad printed the words \"Patience + Perseverance = Reward\" onto the teams pregame banner, acknowledging the team's misfortunes in the past (especially to the Bulldogs) and how they would once again lift the trophy.\n\nIn 2011, The Eagles became the only club in the millennia to defeat Central District in two grand finals, with a thrilling 3-point win – 81 to 78 on 9 October 2011. The Eagles went in as the underdogs but coach Michael Godden (in only his second year with the team and in a senior coaching position) believed his Eagles could over come the Dogs.\n\nAll state ruckman Craig Parry was named the Jack Oatey Medalist for Best on Ground for 2011.\n\nGodden became the third coach to win a Premiership for Woodville-West Torrens, following Bruce Winter (1993) & Ron Fuller (2006) and the second on his first attempt (Winter 1993).\n\nThe Eagles became the first side to win the Premiership from a Qualifying Final loss since Sturt did so in 1976, and the only club in the competition to have won Premierships in each of the last 3 decades.\n\nIn 2015 the Woodville West Torrens Football Club celebrated their 25th season in the SANFL, and dominated the competition in U/18s, Reserves and League, taking out each Minor Premiership (the only club to ever do so) dropping just 4 games across all 3 grades throughout the minor round season. The league team with a 16–2 record from their 18 games.\n\nEach club progressed straight through to their respective Grand Finals, and the Reserves completed a remarkable undefeated season (first team to do so since West Torrens in 1919) to take out their 8th flag.\nUnfortunately the League team were dealt with 3 major season ending injuries in their 2nd semi-final victory, ripping out their engine room including Magarey Medal Runner-up and eventual 2015 Club Champion Angus Rowntree, as well as number 1 ruckman Marc Borholm and former Reserves Magarey Medalist Angus Poole.\n\nIt proved too much to cover for the Eagles in the Grand Final, falling short to West Adelaide by 30 points. The U/18s also lost their decider.\n\nIt was a bitterly disappointing end for Michael Godden and his men after a near perfect season, cruelled by injury at the final hurdle.\n\nIn 2011, a study commissioned by the AFL identified Woodville-West Torrens as the most effective developer of AFL talent in the country. From 1998–2010, the Eagles had 19 selected at the AFL Draft.\n\nNotable AFL Listed Players\n\n\nThe Woodville-West Torrens Football Club Song is called \"We're the might flying Eagles\" and is to the tune of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\"\n\n\"(Verse)\"\n\n\"We're the mighty Eagles\"<br>\n\"And we always battle through\"<br>\n\"The mighty flying Eagles\"<br>\n\"Wearing Gold and Green and Blue\"<br>\n\"Sound the Siren, turn us loose\"<br>\n\"And watch the Feathers fly\"<br>\n\"And you'll see what we can do\"\n\n\"(Chorus)\"\n\n\"We're the mighty flying Eagles\"<br>\n\"We're the mighty flying Eagles\"<br>\n\"We're the mighty flying Eagles\"<br>\n\"In Gold and Green and Blue\"\n\n\"(Home Run)\"\n\n\"In Gold and Green and Blue\"\n\n\"italics\" current coach\n\n\"italics\" current captain<br>\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Premiership Captain (Justin Cicolella was acting captain for the 2006 Premiership)\n\n\n\nPresented to best on ground for South Australia in a State match\n\n\nPresented to best on ground in an SANFL Grand Final\n\n\n\n\nPresented to best on ground in an SANFL Reserves Grand Final\n\nPresented to best on ground in an SANFL U/18's Grand Final\n\n\nPresented to best on ground in an ANZAC Day match (Grand Final replay)\n\nPresented to best SANFL player as voted by League coaches\n\n\n\"The highest individual honour that is bestowed by the club\"\n\n\nThe Woodville-West Torrens Eagles first home ground was SANFL league headquarters Football Park in their inaugural season of 1991. In 1992 the new club moved permanently to the Woodville Oval (former home of the Woodville Warriors). Due to Woodville Oval also being the home of the Woodville Cricket Club who play in the South Australian Grade Cricket League, the Eagles use West Torrens' former home ground Thebarton Oval as their pre-season training base. Thebarton, which had lights installed for night games since the 1950s (the lights were upgraded in 2011–12), is occasionally used as an alternative playing venue for the club, with the team having played a handful of games at the venue since 2006.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838387", "title": "Ben Bernanke", "text": "Ben Bernanke\n\nBen Shalom Bernanke ( ; born December 13, 1953) is an American economist at the Brookings Institution who served two terms as Chair of the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, from 2006 to 2014. During his tenure as chair, Bernanke oversaw the Federal Reserve's response to the late-2000s financial crisis.\nBefore becoming Federal Reserve chair, Bernanke was a tenured professor at Princeton University and chaired the department of economics there from 1996 to September 2002, when he went on public service leave.\n\nFrom August 5, 2002 until June 21, 2005, he was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, proposed the Bernanke Doctrine, and first discussed \"the Great Moderation\" — the theory that traditional business cycles have declined in volatility in recent decades through structural changes that have occurred in the international economy, particularly increases in the economic stability of developing nations, diminishing the influence of macroeconomic (monetary and fiscal) policy.\n\nBernanke then served as chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers before President Bush nominated him to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the United States Federal Reserve. His first term began February 1, 2006. Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being renominated by President Barack Obama, who later referred to him as \"the epitome of calm.\" His second term ended January 31, 2014, when he was succeeded by Janet Yellen on February 3, 2014.\n\nBernanke wrote about his time as chairman of the Federal Reserve in his 2015 book, \"The Courage to Act\", in which he revealed that the world's economy came close to collapse in 2007 and 2008. Bernanke asserts that it was only the novel efforts of the Fed (cooperating with other agencies and agencies of foreign governments) that prevented an economic catastrophe greater than the Great Depression.\n\nBernanke was born in Augusta, Georgia, and was raised on East Jefferson Street in Dillon, South Carolina. His father Philip was a pharmacist and part-time theater manager. His mother Edna was an elementary school teacher. Bernanke has two younger siblings. His brother, Seth, is a lawyer in Charlotte, North Carolina. His sister, Sharon, is a longtime administrator at Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\nThe Bernankes were one of the few Jewish families in Dillon and attended Ohav Shalom, a local synagogue; Bernanke learned Hebrew as a child from his maternal grandfather, Harold Friedman, a professional hazzan (service leader), shochet, and Hebrew teacher. Bernanke's father and uncle owned and managed a drugstore they purchased from Bernanke's paternal grandfather, Jonas Bernanke.\n\nJonas Bernanke was born in Boryslav, Austria-Hungary (today part of Ukraine), on January 23, 1891. He immigrated to the United States from Przemyśl, Austria-Hungary (today part of Poland) and arrived at Ellis Island, aged 30, on June 30, 1921, with his wife Pauline, aged 25. On the ship's manifest, Jonas's occupation is listed as \"clerk\" and Pauline's as \"doctor med\".\n\nThe family moved to Dillon from New York in the 1940s. Bernanke's mother gave up her job as a schoolteacher when her son was born and worked at the family drugstore. Ben Bernanke also worked there sometimes.\n\nAs a teenager, Bernanke worked construction on a new hospital and waited tables at a restaurant at nearby South of the Border, a roadside attraction in his hometown of Dillon, before leaving for college. To support himself throughout college, he worked during the summers at South of the Border.\n\nAs a teenager in the 1960s in the small town of Dillon, Bernanke used to help roll the Torah scrolls in his local synagogue. Although he keeps his beliefs private, his friend Mark Gertler, chairman of New York University's economics department, says they are \"embedded in who he (Bernanke) is\". The Bernanke family was concerned that Ben would \"lose his Jewish identity\" if he went to Harvard. Fellow Dillon native Kenneth Manning, who would eventually become a professor of the history of sciences at MIT, assured the family \"there are Jews in Boston\". Once Bernanke was at Harvard for his freshman year, Manning took him to Brookline for Rosh Hashanah services.\n\nBernanke was educated at East Elementary, J.V. Martin Junior High, and Dillon High School, where he was class valedictorian and played saxophone in the marching band. Since Dillon High School did not offer calculus at the time, Bernanke taught it to himself. Bernanke scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT and was a National Merit Scholar. He also was a contestant in the 1965 National Spelling Bee.\n\nBernanke attended Harvard University in 1971, where he lived in Winthrop House, as did the future CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, and graduated with an A.B. degree, and later with an A.M. in economics \"summa cum laude\" in 1975. He received a Ph.D. degree in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1979 after completing and defending his dissertation, \"Long-Term Commitments, Dynamic Optimization, and the Business Cycle\". Bernanke's thesis adviser was the future governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, and his readers included Irwin S. Bernstein, Rüdiger Dornbusch, Robert Solow, and Peter Diamond of MIT and Dale Jorgenson of Harvard.\n\nBernanke met his wife, Anna, a schoolteacher, on a blind date. She was a student at Wellesley College, and he was in graduate school at MIT. The Bernankes have two children, Joel and Alyssa. He is an ardent fan of the Washington Nationals baseball team, and frequently attends games at Nationals Park.\n\nWhen Bernanke left Stanford to accept a position at Princeton, he and his family moved to Montgomery Township, New Jersey in 1985, where Bernanke's children attended the local public schools. Bernanke served for six years as a member of the board of education of the Montgomery Township School District.\nIn 2009 The Wall Street Journal reported that Bernanke was a victim of identity theft, a spreading crime the Federal Reserve has for years issued warnings about.\n\nBernanke taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business from 1979 until 1985, was a visiting professor at New York University and went on to become a tenured professor at Princeton University in the Department of Economics. He chaired that department from 1996 until September 2002, when he went on public service leave. He resigned his position at Princeton July 1, 2005.\n\nBernanke served as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2002 to 2005. In one of his first speeches as a Governor, entitled \"Deflation: Making Sure It Doesn't Happen Here\", he outlined what has been referred to as the Bernanke Doctrine.\n\nAs a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 20, 2004, Bernanke gave a speech in which he postulated that we are in a new era called the Great Moderation, where modern macroeconomic policy has decreased the volatility of the business cycle to the point that it should no longer be a central issue in economics.\n\nIn June 2005, Bernanke was named chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, and resigned as Fed Governor. The appointment was largely viewed as a test run to ascertain if Bernanke could be Bush's pick to succeed Greenspan as Fed chairman the next year. He held the post until January 2006.\n\nOn February 1, 2006, Bernanke began a fourteen-year term as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and a four-year term as chairman (after having been nominated by President Bush in late 2005). By virtue of the chairmanship, he sat on the Financial Stability Oversight Board that oversees the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He also served as chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the System's principal monetary policy making body.\n\nHis first months as chairman of the Federal Reserve System were marked by difficulties communicating with the media. An advocate of more transparent Fed policy and clearer statements than Greenspan had made, he had to back away from his initial idea of stating clearer inflation goals as such statements tended to affect the stock market. Maria Bartiromo disclosed on CNBC comments from their private conversation at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. She reported that Bernanke said investors had misinterpreted his comments as indicating that he was \"dovish\" on inflation. He was sharply criticized for making public statements about Fed direction, which he said was a \"lapse in judgment.\"\n\nAs the Great Recession deepened, Bernanke oversaw some unorthodox measures. Under his guidance, the Fed lowered its funds interest rate from 5.25% to 0.0% within less than a year. When this was considered insufficient to abate the liquidity crisis, the Fed initiated quantitative easing, creating $1.3 trillion from November 2008 to June 2010 and using the created money to buy financial assets from banks and from the government.\n\nOn August 25, 2009, President Obama announced he would nominate Bernanke to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. In a short statement on Martha's Vineyard, with Bernanke standing at his side, Obama said Bernanke's background, temperament, courage and creativity helped to prevent another Great Depression in 2008. When Senate Banking Committee hearings on his nomination began on December 3, 2009, several senators from both parties indicated they would not support a second term.\n\nHowever, Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, by a 70–30 vote of the full Senate, the narrowest margin, at the time, for any occupant of the position. (For the roll-call vote, see Obama confirmations, 2010.) The Senate first voted 77–23 to end debate, Bernanke winning more than the 60 approval votes needed to overcome the possibility of a filibuster. On a second vote to confirm, the 30 dissents came from 11 Democrats, 18 Republicans and one independent.\n\nBernanke was succeeded as Chair of the Federal Reserve by Janet Yellen, the first woman to hold the position. Yellen was nominated on October 9, 2013, by President Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate on January 6, 2014.\n\nBernanke has been subjected to criticism concerning the late-2000s financial crisis. According to \"The New York Times\", Bernanke \"has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost.\"\n\nIn a letter to Congress from then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo dated April 23, 2009, Bernanke was mentioned along with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in allegations of fraud concerning the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. The letter alleged that the extent of the losses at Merrill Lynch were not disclosed to Bank of America by Bernanke and Paulson. When Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis informed Paulson that Bank of America was exiting the merger by invoking the \"Materially Adverse Change\" (MAC) clause, Paulson immediately called Lewis to a meeting in Washington. At the meeting, which allegedly took place on December 21, 2008, Paulson told Lewis that he and the board would be replaced if they invoked the MAC clause and additionally not to reveal the extent of the losses to shareholders. Paulson stated to Cuomo's office that he was directed by Bernanke to threaten Lewis in this manner.\n\nCongressional hearings into these allegations were conducted on June 25, 2009, with Bernanke testifying that he did not bully Ken Lewis. Under intense questioning by members of Congress, Bernanke said, \"I never said anything about firing the board and the management [of Bank of America].\" In further testimony, Bernanke said the Fed did nothing illegal or unethical in its efforts to convince Bank of America not to end the merger. Lewis told the panel that authorities expressed \"strong views\" but said he would not characterize their stance as improper.\n\nAccording to a January 26, 2010, column in \"The Huffington Post\", a whistleblower has disclosed documents providing troubling details' of Bernanke's role in the AIG bailout\". Republican Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky said on CNBC that he had seen documents which show Bernanke overruled recommendations from his staff in bailing out AIG. The columnist says this raises questions as to whether or not the decision to bail out AIG was necessary. Senators from both parties who support Bernanke say his actions averted worse problems and outweigh whatever responsibility he may have for the financial crisis.\n\nThe crisis in 2008 also made then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke create a pseudonym, Edward Quince. According to the Wall Street Journal, the false name was evidence in a class-action lawsuit against the government by shareholders of AIG, which had been given a Fed-backed bailout when it was near collapse. One of Mr. Quince's emails reads, \"We think they are days from failure. They think it is a temporary problem. This disconnect is dangerous.\"\n\nUpon the revelation of the Quince pseudonym during the Starr v. United States trial, \"The New York Times\" created a cocktail inspired by Mr. Bernanke's chosen alias: the \"Rye & Quince.\"\n\nBernanke has given several lectures at the London School of Economics on monetary theory and policy. He has written two textbooks: an intermediate-level macroeconomics textbook coauthored with Andrew Abel (and also Dean Croushore in later editions) and an introductory textbook, covering both microeconomics and macroeconomics, coauthored with Robert H. Frank. Bernanke was the Director of the Monetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic Research and the editor of the American Economic Review. He is among the 50 most published economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc.\n\nBernanke is particularly interested in the economic and political causes of the Great Depression, on which he has published numerous academic journal articles. Before Bernanke's work, the dominant monetarist theory of the Great Depression was Milton Friedman's view that it had been largely caused by the Federal Reserve's having reduced the money supply and has on several occasions argued that one of the biggest mistakes made during the period was to raise interest rates too early. In a speech on Milton Friedman's ninetieth birthday (November 8, 2002), Bernanke said:\n\"Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna [Schwartz, Friedman's coauthor]: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.\"\n\nBernanke has cited Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in his decision to lower interest rates to zero. Anna Schwartz, however, was highly critical of Bernanke and wrote an opinion piece in \"The New York Times\" advising Obama against his reappointment as chair of the Federal Reserve. Bernanke focused less on the role of the Federal Reserve and more on the role of private banks and financial institutions.\n\nBernanke found that the financial disruptions of 1930–33 reduced the efficiency of the credit allocation process; and that the resulting higher cost and reduced availability of credit acted to depress aggregate demand, identifying an effect he called the financial accelerator. When faced with a mild downturn, banks are likely to significantly cut back lending and other risky ventures. This further hurts the economy, creating a vicious cycle and potentially turning a mild recession into a major depression. Economist Brad DeLong, who had previously advocated his own theory for the Great Depression, notes that the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 has raised the pertinence of Bernanke's theory.\n\nIn 2002, following coverage of concerns about deflation in the business news, Bernanke gave a speech about the topic. In that speech, he mentioned that the government in a fiat money system owns the physical means of creating money and to maintain market liquidity. Control of the money supply implies that the government can always avoid deflation by simply issuing more money. He said \"The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at no cost.\"\n\nHe referred to a statement made by Milton Friedman about using a \"helicopter drop\" of money into the economy to fight deflation. Bernanke's critics have since referred to him as \"Helicopter Ben\" or to his \"helicopter printing press.\" In a footnote to his speech, Bernanke noted that \"people know that inflation erodes the real value of the government's debt and, therefore, that it is in the interest of the government to create some inflation.\"\n\nFor example, while Greenspan publicly supported President Clinton's deficit reduction plan and the Bush tax cuts, Bernanke, when questioned about taxation policy, said that it was none of his business, his exclusive remit being monetary policy, and said that fiscal policy and wider society related issues were what politicians were for and got elected for. But Bernanke has been identified by \"The Wall Street Journal\" and a close colleague as a \"libertarian-Republican\" in the mold of Alan Greenspan.\n\nIn 2005 Bernanke coined the term saving glut, the idea that relatively high level of worldwide savings was holding down interest rates and financing the current account deficits of the United States. (Alternative reasons include relatively low worldwide investment coupled with low U.S. savings.)\n\nAs the recession began to deepen in 2007, many economists urged Bernanke (and the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee) to lower the federal funds rate below what it had done. For example, Larry Summers, later named Director of the White House's National Economic Council under President Obama, wrote in the \"Financial Times\" on November 26, 2007—in a column in which he argued that recession was likely—that \"... maintaining demand must be the macro-economic priority. That means the Federal Reserve System has to get ahead of the curve and recognize—as the market already has—that levels of the Federal Funds rate that were neutral when the financial system was working normally are quite contractionary today.\"\n\nDavid Leonhardt of \"The New York Times\" wrote, on January 30, 2008, that \"Dr. Bernanke's forecasts have been too sunny over the last six months. [On] the other hand, his forecast was a lot better than Wall Street's in mid-2006. Back then, he resisted calls for further interest rate increases because he thought the economy might be weakening.\"\n\nIn a speech at the American Economics Association conference in January 2014, Bernanke reflected on his tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve. He expressed his hope that economic growth was building momentum and stated that he was confident that the central bank would be able to withdraw its support smoothly.\n\nIn an October 2014 speech, Bernanke disclosed that he was unsuccessful in efforts to refinance his home. He suggested that lenders \"may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions\".\n\nSince February 2014, Bernanke has been employed as a Distinguished Fellow in Residence with the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution.\n\nOn April 16, 2015, it was announced publicly that Bernanke will work with Citadel, the $25 billion hedge fund founded by billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, as a senior adviser. In the same month it was revealed that Bernanke would also join Pimco as a senior advisor.\n\nIn his 2015 book, \"The Courage to Act\", Bernanke revealed that he was no longer a Republican, having \"lost patience with Republicans' susceptibility to the know-nothing-ism of the far right. ... I view myself now as a moderate independent, and I think that's where I'll stay.\"\n\nBernanke favors reducing the U.S. budget deficit, particularly by reforming the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs. During a speech delivered on April 7, 2010, he warned that the U.S. must soon develop a \"credible\" plan to address the pending funding crisis faced by \"entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare\" or \"in the longer run we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth.\" Bernanke said that formulation of such a plan would help the economy in the near term, even if actual implementation of the plan might have to wait until the economic outlook improves.\n\nHis remarks were most likely intended for the federal government's executive and legislative branches, since entitlement reform is a fiscal exercise that will be accomplished by the Congress and the President rather than a monetary task falling within the implementation powers of the Federal Reserve. Bernanke also pointed out that deficit reduction will necessarily consist of either raising taxes, cutting entitlement payments and other government spending, or some combination of both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1838391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838391", "title": "Loop dependence analysis", "text": "Loop dependence analysis\n\nLoop dependence analysis is a process which can be used to find dependencies within iterations of a loop with the goal of determining different relationships between statements. These dependent relationships are tied to the order in which different statements access memory locations. Using the analysis of these relationships, execution of the loop can be organized to allow multiple processors to work on different portions of the loop in parallel. This is known as parallel processing. In general, loops can consume a lot of processing time when executed as serial code. Through parallel processing, it is possible to reduce the total execution time of a program through sharing the processing load among multiple processors.\n\nThe process of organizing statements to allow multiple processors to work on different portions of a loop is often referred to as parallelization. In order to see how we can exploit parallelization, we have to first analyze the dependencies within individual loops. These dependencies will help determine which statements in the loop need to be completed before other statements can start, and which statements in the loop can be executed in parallel with respect to the other statements in the loop. Two general categories of dependencies that will be analyzed in the loop are data dependencies and control dependencies.\n\nLoop dependence analysis occur on a normalized loop of the form:\nwhere <samp>\"body\"</samp> may contain:\nWhere \"a\" is an m-dimensional array and <samp>f</samp>, <samp>h</samp>, etc. are functions mapping from all iteration indexes (i) to a memory access in a particular dimension of the array.\n\nFor example, in C:\nfor (i = 0; i < U1; i++)\nf would be <samp>i+4-j</samp>, controlling the write on the first dimension of \"a\" and h would be <samp>2*i-j</samp>, controlling the read on the first dimension of \"b\".\n\nThe scope of the problem is to find all possible dependencies between \"S1\" and \"S2\". To be conservative, any dependence which cannot be proven false must be assumed to be true.\n\nIndependence is shown by demonstrating that no two instances of \"S1\" and \"S2\" access or modify the same spot in array <samp>a</samp>. When a possible dependence is found, loop dependence analysis usually makes every attempt to characterize the relationship between dependent instances, as some optimizations may still be possible. It may also be possible to transform the loop to remove or modify the dependence.\n\nIn the course of (dis)proving such dependencies, a statement \"S\" may be decomposed according to which iteration it comes from. For instance, \"S\"[1,3,5] refers to the iteration where <samp>i1 = 1</samp>, <samp>i2 = 3</samp> and <samp>i3 = 5</samp>. Of course, references to abstract iterations, such as \"S\"[\"d1\"+1,\"d2\",\"d3\"], are both permitted and common.\n\nData dependencies show the relationships between the variables in the code. There are three different types of data dependencies:\n\nA true dependence occurs when a location in memory is written to before it is read. It introduces read-after-write (RAW) hazards because the instruction that reads from the location in memory has to wait until it is written to by the previous instruction or else the reading instruction will read the wrong value. An example of a true dependence is:\nIn this example, there is a true dependence between S1 and S2 because variable a is first written in statement S1 and then variable a is read by statement S2.\nThis true dependence can be represented by S1 →T S2.\nA true dependence can also be seen when reading and writing between different iterations in a loop. The following example shows a true dependence between different iterations.\nIn this example, a true dependence exists between statement S1 in the jth iteration and S1 in the j+1th iteration. There is a true dependence because a value will be written to a[j] in one iteration and then a read occurs by a[j-1] in the next iteration. This true dependence can be represented by S1[j] →T S1[j+1].\n\nAn anti dependence occurs when a location in memory is read before that same location is written to. This introduces write-after-read (WAR) hazards because the instruction that writes the data into a memory location has to wait until that memory location has been read by the previous instruction or else the reading instruction would read the wrong value. An example of an anti dependence is:\nIn this example, there is an anti dependence between statements S1 and S2. This is an anti dependence because variable b is first read in statement S1 and then variable b is written to in statement S2. This can be represented by S1 →A S2. An anti dependence can be seen by different iterations in a loop. The following example shows an example of this case:\nIn this example, there is an anti dependence between the jth iteration of S1 and the j+1th element of S1. Here, the j+1th element is read before that same element is written in the next iteration of j. This anti dependence can be represented by S1[j] →A S1[j+1].\n\nAn output dependence occurs when a location in memory is written to before that same location is written to again in another statement. This introduces write-after-write(WAW) hazards because the second instruction to write the value to a memory location needs to wait until the first instruction finishes writing data to the same memory location or else when the memory location is read at a later time it will contain the wrong value. An example of an output dependence is:\nIn this example, there is an output dependence between statements S1 and S2. Here, the variable c is first written to in S1 and then variable c is written to again in statement S2. This output dependence can be represented by S1 →O S2. An output dependence can be seen by different iterations in a loop. The following code snippet shows an example of this case:\nIn this example, there is an output dependence between the jth element in S1 and the j+1th element in S2. Here, c[j+1] in statement S2 is written to in one iteration. In the next iteration, c[j] in statement S2, which is the same memory location as c[j+1] in the previous iteration, is written to again. This output dependence can be represented as S1[j] →O S2[j+1].\n\nControl dependencies must also be considered when analyzing dependencies between different statements in a loop. Control dependencies are dependencies introduced by the code or the programming algorithm itself. They control the order in which instructions occur within the execution of code. One common example is an \"if\" statement. \"if\" statements create branches in a program. The \"then\" portion of the \"if\" statement explicitly directs or controls actions to be taken.\n\nLoop-carried dependencies and loop independent dependencies are determined by the relationships between statements in iterations of a loop. When a statement in one iteration of a loop depends in some way on a statement in a different iteration of the same loop, a loop-carried dependence exists. However, if a statement in one iteration of a loop depends only on a statement in the same iteration of the loop, this creates a loop independent dependence.\n\nIteration space traversal graphs (ITG) shows the path that the code takes when traversing through the iterations of the loop. Each iteration is represented with a node. Loop carried dependence graphs (LDG) gives a visual representation of all true dependencies, anti dependencies, and output dependencies that exist between different iterations in a loop. Each iteration is represented with a node.\nIt is easier to show the difference between the two graphs with a nested for loop.\nIn this example, there is a true dependence between the j iteration of statement S1 and the j+1th statement of S1. This can be represented as S1[i,j] →T S1[i,j+1] The iteration space traversal graph and the loop carried dependence graph is: Iteration Space Traversal Graph: Loop Carried Dependence Graph:\n"}

At age 24 he was hired by Connecticut industrialist Samuel W. Collins to work in his axe factory in Collinsville, a village of Canton, Connecticut.\n\nAccording to historian Diana Muir writing in Reflections in Bullough's Pond, Root \"reconceptualized\" the making of axes. Until his invention, axes were made by \"flattening wrought iron, folding it around a steel pin, and forging the two sides together under a trip hammer.\" Root arranged \"a series of dies and rollers that could 'die forge' -or apply pressure to a mold, forming apiece of hot wrought iron into the shape of an ax, with an eye already punched to receive the handle.\" According to Muir, Root next automated the tempering of axes by inventing a machine that moved ax heads through a temperature-regulated oven on a rotating wheel. And a machine that \"shaved\" the axes to give them a sharp edge, so that they needed only a small amount of finishing on a grindstone.\n\nIn 1849 Samuel Colt hired Root to come work in his Hartford firearms factory as a superintendent. Root performed this role with great success, developing many star employees.\n\nIt was while working for Colt that Root perfected the Lincoln miller milling machine, 150,000 of which were sold in the late 19th century, making it the most important American machine tool of the era. He modernized firearms production at Colt by designing state of the art drop hammers, boring machines, gauges, jigs, etc. Root also improved the milling machine invented by Simeon North and improved by the Robbins and Lawrence Company of Vermont and by Francis A. Pratt of the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford, Connecticut. The improved tool was known as the Lincoln Miller.\n\nThe Colt Model 1855 Sidehammer Pocket Revolver, or Colt Root Revolver, was named in honor of the engineer, and saw use during the American Civil War.\n\nAfter Colt's death in 1862, Root took over as president of Colt's Patent Firearms until his death on September 1, 1865.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1838410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838410", "title": "Hopak", "text": "Hopak\n\nHopak or Cossack (, ) is a Ukrainian folk dance originating as a male dance among the Zaporozhian Cossacks but later danced by couples, male soloists, and mixed groups of dancers. It is performed most often as a solitary concert dance by amateur and professional Ukrainian dance ensembles, as well as other performers of folk dances. It has also been incorporated into larger artistic opuses such as operas, ballets and theatre. \n\nThe hopak is often popularly referred to as the \"National Dance of Ukraine\" and has become very popular among Slavic countries, in particular Russia, Belarus and Poland. There are similar folkloric dance tunes known as \"Sirmpa\" in Leros, Greece.\n\nThe name \"hopak\" is derived from the verb \"hopaty\" () which means \"to jump,\" as well as the corresponding exclamation \"hop!\" () which can be uttered during a jump as an expression of surprise or amazement. It is also referred to as gopak from the Russian form.\n\nGopak or Hopak dance forms have been found to be represented in some of the mesopotamian seals depicting dance scenes in the Old Babylonian period (2000-1800 BC).\n\nThe Hopak developed initially as a Cossack social dance (, translit. \"pobutovi tantsi\"), and was practiced in the lands of present-day Ukraine beginning in the 16th century. While the militaristic Zaporizhian Sich generally frowned upon amusements and diversions from military training, such regulations were overlooked when Kozaks returned victorious after battle. Kobzars and other musicians would gather their instruments - violins, bagpipes, bandura, cimbaloms, and fifes - while other participants would dance.\nThese celebratory \"hopaky\" were performed only by male participants, as they took place in an all-male environment. The performers were young, boisterous mercenaries, and not professional dancers; as such, the dance steps performed were predominantly improvisational, reflecting the performers' sense of manliness, heroism, speed and strength. The steps exhibited included many acrobatic jumps (, translit. \"strybky\"). Often fights from the battlefield would be re-enacted in pantomime, with real swords, lances or other weaponry, as the performer lashed out at invisible enemies. These dances were not tied down to specific rhythms, and the dancers could change tempo at any point.\n\nSuch festive dancing differed greatly in character from the older ritual dances (, translit. \"obryadovi tantsi\"), such as the Khorovod, which had previously been the dominant choreographic works in Ruthenian lands. A primary distinction was the gender of the participants – all male – as opposed to the predominantly all-female ritual dances.\n\nWith the elevation of Kozak status in the region, \"hopaky\" began to appear in the villages within their domain. Unlike the all-male dances found in the Sich, these dances were mixed, with young boys and girls dancing celebratory movements together. While the lead role was retained by male performers, structural elements began to be added in, such as circle forms and pairs moving together in formation; these developments most likely were derived from the choreographic history of ritual dances in the area.\n\nNone of the dances performed by Kozaks during this time were ever recorded. Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan recorded the fact that Kozaks danced in such a manner, and other historical accounts verify this. Later, Ivan Kotliarevsky and Taras Shevchenko incorporated the Hopak and dancing Kozaks into their works. However, with the destruction of the Sich in the 18th century, the dance survived only in its mixed-gender village format as a celebratory dance.\n\nAfter Hopak-like dances began to be performed on stage in the 18th century in Serf and Peasant theaters, professional dramatic troupes began to incorporate this popular dance into their repertoire. These performances only incorporated the Hopak into a larger opus, such as Kotliarevsky's operetta \"Natalka Poltavka\". It was the pioneering work of a performer in a dramatic ensemble, the ethnochoreologist Vasyl Verkhovynets, in the early 20th century, that enable the dance to develop into its current format. Verkhovynets' initial work entailed gathering authentic village steps throughout central Ukraine and constructing dances which more accurately represented the Ukrainian cultural tradition. His break-through, however, was demonstrating that staged Ukrainian dance could exist as a distinct performing art, in the form of concert dance. He and his disciple Vasyl Avramenko began staging performances throughout western Ukraine, forming troupes of dancers in village after village.\n\nIn the spring of 1935, the All-Union Organization of Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries agreed to send a delegation to the upcoming First International Festival of the Folk Dance in London. Verkhovynets worked with Leonid Zhukov of the T. Shevchenko Kyiv Opera and Ballet, and professional dancers from both the Kyiv and Kharkiv Opera houses, on constructing a suite to represent the Ukrainian SSR. For his part, Verkhovynets choreographed what became known as the \"London Hopak\" (, translit. \"londonskiy hopak\"): this was a 3-part dance, consisting of a men's dance (much like the original Kozak dance), a second, slower segment danced only by women, and finally a rousing closing with both male and female dancers sharing the stage. This dance, along with Zhukov's addition, won the first prize at the festival that summer. The 3-part Hopak was later reprised in September back in Ukraine as part of the opera, Zaporozhets za Dunayem. The format of the 3-part Hopak was subsequently adopted by many professional folk dance ensembles who have choreographed their own variants of Hopak through the years.\n\nIn 1990, twenty members of the State Folk Dance Ensemble of the Ukrainian SSR, split off and created the Hopak! Ukrainian Dance Company, Ukraine's first independent professional dance company, under the direction of Sergei Makarov.\n\nThe modern-day Hopak is a choreographed dance made to appear full of improvisation. Much of the seemingly improvised parts involve solo dancers, usually male, performing visually and technically amazing acrobatic feats. These include jumps and spins and are usually the highlight of the performance.\n\nThe rest of the dance includes many movements performed in unison, especially by the female dancers, while male dancers typically perform squat sequences.\n\nBecause of the speed and energy required to perform a successful Hopak, this dance is usually performed at the end of a program. As in many Ukrainian dances, the dancers, especially the women, do not stop moving until the end of the dance.\n\nMusic for the Hopak is not standardized by tempo or melody, although time predominates most arrangements. The dance is supposed to evoke a sense of improvisation, so the pace of the music changes from segment to segment, allowing dancers to distinguish themselves. The melodies of the songs \"Hop, moyi hrechanyky\" () and \"Vid Kyiva do Lubny\" () can be found in many Hopak arrangements. Hopaks usually end on a fast and furious pace, with some incorporating boisterous Ukrainian marches, such as \"Zasvystaly kozachen'ky\" ().\n\nA number of composers have composed a Hopak as part of an opera or ballet:\n\n\n\nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin once famously forced his eventual successor Nikita Khrushchev (who had been the Communist Party chief in Ukraine) to dance the Hopak.\n\nThe Hopak was performed as a part of the choreographic suite \"Friendship of Peoples\" by dancers in Ukrainian folk costumes during the opening ceremony of the 1980 Summer Olympics. This event took place on the field of the Central Lenin Stadium, with a large section of the tribune under the Olympic Flame Cauldron coloured in Ukrainian folk patterns during the performance.\n\nIn the 2000s (decade), the music has been extensively used for Anna Bessonova and Natalia Godunko in their routines of rhythmic gymnastics; these two famous rhythmic gymnasts are natives of Ukraine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1838414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838414", "title": "Brad Ausmus", "text": "Brad Ausmus\n\nBradley David Ausmus (; born April 14, 1969) is an American former professional baseball manager and catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). In his 18-year MLB playing career, Ausmus played for the San Diego Padres, Detroit Tigers, Houston Astros, and Los Angeles Dodgers. He was also the manager of the Tigers and Los Angeles Angels, and of the Israel national baseball team.\n\nA 1987 draft pick of the New York Yankees, he chose to alternate between attending Dartmouth College and playing minor league baseball. Ausmus then had an 18-year major league playing career with the San Diego Padres, Detroit Tigers, Houston Astros, and Los Angeles Dodgers. During his playing days he was an All Star in 1999, a three-time Gold Glove Award winner (2001, '02, and '06), and won the 2007 Darryl Kile Award \"for integrity and courage\".\n\nA five-time league-leader at catcher in fielding percentage, Ausmus also led the league twice each in range factor and in percentage caught stealing, and once each in putouts and assists.\n\nAusmus finished his playing career in 2010 ranked third in major league history with 12,839 putouts as a catcher (trailing only Iván Rodríguez and Jason Kendall), seventh in games caught with 1,938, and 10th in both range factor/game (7.12) and fielding percentage (.994). He also ranked first all-time among all Jewish major leaguers in career games played (1,971), fifth in hits (1,579), and eighth in runs batted in (607; directly behind Mike Lieberthal). He was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. He worked in the Padres' front office as a special assistant from 2010 to 2013. In November 2013, Ausmus became the 38th manager in the history of the Detroit Tigers, succeeding Jim Leyland, a position that he held for four years. In October 2018, he was named the 17th manager in the history of the Los Angeles Angels. Ausmus was fired as the manager for the Los Angeles Angels in September 2019.\n\nAusmus is Jewish, and was born in New Haven, Connecticut. His mother, Linda Susan (née Dronsick), was Jewish, and his father, Harry Jack Ausmus, is Protestant. His father is a retired professor of European history at Southern Connecticut State University, and the author of \"A Schopenhauerian Critique of Nietzsche's Thought\", which Ausmus calls his \"favorite book.\"\n\nAusmus' mother was Jewish, and was raised in a Jewish household, and he said in an interview that those values were instilled in him. He takes pride in his heritage. Ausmus stated in an interview with the \"Jewish Journal\": \"I wasn't raised with the Jewish religion, so in that sense I don't really have much feeling toward it. But, however, in the last 10 or so years, I have had quite a few young Jewish boys who will tell me that I am their favorite player or they love watching me play or they feel like baseball is a good fit for them because it worked for me or it worked for Shawn Green or other Jewish players at the major league level. It has been a sense of pride. If you can have a positive impact on a kid, I'm all for it.\"\n\nIn 2001, he did not play on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, quipping that he \"was trying to atone for my poor first half.\" Ausmus was the manager of the Israeli team at the 2013 World Baseball Classic. The Classic's rules permit non-Israeli citizens of Jewish heritage to play for the Israeli team.\n\nAusmus and his wife, Liz, were married in 1995. They live in New Haven, Connecticut, and have two daughters, Sophie and Abigail.\n\nAusmus was a star in baseball at Cheshire High School; as a freshman he was a teammate of National Hockey League defenseman Brian Leetch, who was then a pitcher on the school's Connecticut state championship team in 1984. As a sophomore Ausmus played shortstop and batted .327. As a junior (when his coach moved him to catcher) he hit .436, and as a senior he hit .411 and was named the Cheshire Area High School Player of the Year. He was named to the All-State team both his junior and senior years.\n\nAusmus was also a standout athlete in high school as a basketball guard.\n\nAcademically, Ausmus scored a 1220 on his SAT exam.\n\nAusmus initially refused to sign with the New York Yankees after the 1987 draft in which the team picked him in the 47th round, instead choosing to pursue another childhood dream, that of attending Dartmouth College.\n\nThe Yankees allowed him to attend classes at the Ivy League school while playing in the minor leagues during his off terms. (Dartmouth has a quartered academic calendar, which allowed Ausmus some flexibility.) Given NCAA rules barring paid professional athletes from playing college sports, Ausmus could not play for the Dartmouth Big Green, and instead served as a volunteer coach and bullpen catcher.\n\nHe graduated in 1991 with an A.B. in Government, and was a member of Chi Gamma Epsilon fraternity and the Sphinx Senior Society. While at Dartmouth, the lowest grade Ausmus received was a B. College graduates are uncommon in major league baseball, with only 26 players and managers with four-year degrees in 2009. In 2005, Ausmus became the first Ivy League catcher to play in the World Series since Dartmouth's Chief Meyers in 1916. Ausmus was also one of six Ivy Leaguers on major league rosters at the beginning of the 2009 season. In 2010, \"The Sporting News\" named him the ninth-smartest athlete in sports.\n\nThough Ausmus was not drafted until the 47th round of the 1987 draft, he played in MLB longer than any of the 1,150 players drafted ahead of him did.\n\nAusmus spent five years in the Yankees' minor league system with the Gulf Coast Yankees (1988), Oneonta Yankees (1988–89), Prince William Cannons (1990–91), Albany-Colonie Yankees (1991–92) and Columbus Clippers (1992). He was subsequently selected by the Colorado Rockies with the 54th pick of the 1992 expansion draft. He spent less than a year in the Colorado organization (with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox) before he was traded to the San Diego Padres with Andy Ashby and Doug Bochtler for Bruce Hurst and Greg Harris in July 1993.\n\nHe made his major league debut two days later, when he started for the Padres against the Chicago Cubs, and had a single in three at bats. In 1995 Ausmus batted .293, a career best, and stole 16 bases (the most by any catcher since Craig Biggio stole 19 in 1991). Within three years, Ausmus was on the move again. In June 1996, after 149 at bats in which he batted just .181, the Padres traded him, Andújar Cedeño and minor leaguer Russ Spear to the Detroit Tigers for John Flaherty and Chris Gomez.\n\nAs of 2010, Ausmus was second among the Padres' all-time catchers in stolen bases, fourth in hits, and fifth in games played.\n\nDespite bouncing back somewhat in Detroit, hitting .248, Ausmus was again traded in December 1996, along with José Lima, Trever Miller, C. J. Nitkowski, and Daryle Ward, to the Houston Astros for Doug Brocail, Brian Hunter, Todd Jones, Orlando Miller, and cash. This marked the first of three times Ausmus would be exchanged between the two teams.\n\nIn January 1999 he was traded by the Astros with C. J. Nitkowski to the Tigers for Paul Bako, Dean Crow, Brian Powell, and minor leaguers Carlos Villalobos and Mark Persails.\n\nGenerally considered light-hitting but sure-handed, Ausmus had his best offensive season in 1999 at the age of 30, when he batted .275 and set career highs in on-base percentage (.365) and slugging percentage (.415), and made the All-Star team. He was hit by pitches 14 times, sixth in the league and a career high. Ausmus batted leadoff for the Tigers seven times, the first catcher since Bruce Kimm in 1976 to do so.\n\nIn December 2000, he was traded by the Tigers with Doug Brocail and Nelson Cruz to the Astros for Roger Cedeño, Chris Holt and Mitch Meluskey.\n\nIn November 2003, he signed as a free agent with the Astros, and Ausmus did the same in December 2005. In 2004, he batted .308 against left-handers, and .364 in situations that were \"late and close\" (in the seventh inning or later, with the score tied or the tying run on base, at the plate, or on deck).\nIn 2005, he had more walks (51) than strikeouts (48). He batted .304 with two out and runners in scoring position. In 2006, Ausmus hit .230 and set a career high with nine sacrifice hits.\n\nIn 2007, Ausmus batted .235, but was tied for second among all National League catchers with six stolen bases. He recorded his 100th career stolen base on July 27, becoming the 21st catcher all time to record that many steals.\n\nAusmus, lauded for his baseball smarts and highly regarded by teammates, was widely considered managerial material once his playing career ended. \n\nIronically, Garner was fired on August 27.\n\nAusmus won the 2007 Darryl Kile Award \"for integrity and courage\", presented annually by local chapters of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) to players on the Astros and St. Louis Cardinals. In October 2007, Ausmus accepted a one-year, $2 million (plus incentives based on playing time) contract. The Astros planned for Ausmus to play on a part-time basis and mentor J. R. Towles, who would catch the majority of the games. Were Towles to struggle, however, the Astros were prepared to turn to Ausmus.\n\nIn May 2008, Ausmus (along with Johnny Damon, Andruw Jones, and Derek Lowe) was one of only four active major league players who had played at least 10 years in the majors without ever going on the disabled list.\n\nOn May 13, 2008, Ausmus got his 1,500th career hit. He is one of only eight catchers in major league history to get 1,500 hits and steal at least 100 bases.\n\nIn early June, with Towles batting only .145, the Astros optioned him to the minors and re-inserted Ausmus as a starter. Towles was replaced by journeyman minor-leaguer Humberto Quintero. Towles eventually came back, but during the season Ausmus, at 39, made more starts behind the plate (61) than either Towles or Quintero.\n\nIn July, Ausmus played at Nationals Park, appearing in his 44th major league stadium. Among active players, only Chris Gomez (47), Gary Sheffield (47), and Ken Griffey, Jr. (45) had competed in more stadiums.\n\nIn August, he scored his 700th career run, becoming the 25th catcher to reach that mark.\n\nLater in the month Ausmus said: \"This will be my last year in Houston. It's just time to be closer to home.\" He has a home in San Diego, which narrowed it down to the Padres (which had expressed interest in him), Dodgers, and Angels. The Red Sox were also tempting, since Ausmus had a home near Boston, in Cape Cod.\n\nOn Sunday, August 24, the Astros played the New York Mets during the Mets International Heritage Week, an annual promotion. It happened to be Jewish Heritage Day, but though Ausmus is Jewish, he did not get to start the game. He had his only at bat during extra-innings, with the score tied at 4–4. Ausmus led off the 10th inning with his second homer of the season, and the Astros rallied for a 6–4 win.\n\nBefore his final game as an Astro on September 28, the team paid tribute to Ausmus with a humorous video. Ausmus went on to hit a 2-run home run in the game.\n\nAusmus was Houston's all-time leader for catchers as of 2010 with 1,259 games, 1,119 starts, 970 hits, and 415 runs.\n\nOn January 26, 2009, Ausmus agreed to a 1-year, $1 million deal (plus incentives) to be a back-up catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\"There's no question he can be a manager\", Joe Torre said. \"He's a smart cookie, everybody knows that, and he has an engaging personality.\" At the end of the season Torre had Ausmus manage the Dodgers for a game.\n\nIn 2009, Ausmus batted .295, including .333 with runners in scoring position, and .385 with 2 out and runners in scoring position, while limited to a career-low 107 at bats. He had never been on the disabled list in his 17-year career, giving him the most consecutive seasons of not going on the DL among all active players.\n\nAusmus became a free agent after the 2009 season, and on January 26, 2010, he agreed to a one-year $850,000 salary deal (with total compensation guaranteed at $1 million) to return to the Dodgers for his 18th major league season. The deal also included a mutual option for 2011 worth $1 million; if either Ausmus or the Dodgers declined the option, Ausmus would be paid $150,000.\n\nIn 2010, Ausmus was the 5th-oldest player in the NL. On April 10, 2010, he was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his 18-year career in the Majors. He missed most of the season after having surgery in April to repair a lower back herniated disc, playing in only 21 games that season, and hitting .222.\n\nAusmus announced his retirement on October 3, 2010.\n\nPrior to 2009, Ausmus had played in the postseason five times, all with the Astros, including the 2005 World Series. In Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, Ausmus homered with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning to tie the game at 6–6 and send it to extra innings; the Astros went on to win in the 18th inning, in what was the longest postseason game in history. Ausmus caught 15 innings, as well as playing 3 innings at first base.\n\nAusmus was known as \"a brilliant defensive catcher,\" \"an incredibly smart catcher,\" and \"one of the most respected game-callers and pitching-staff handlers\" in the game, In 2010, he was chosen as the ninth-smartest athlete in sports by \"Sporting News\". Ausmus exhibited superior range at catcher compared to the league average each season in his career. He was known for his strong arm, quick release, nimble footwork, deft of framing pitches, and smart handling of pitchers, as well as being able to block pitches very well. While the vast majority of his games were as a catcher, Ausmus also played a handful of games at first base, second base, third base, and shortstop, all of them without making an error.\n\nHe led NL catchers in putouts in 1994, with 683. Ausmus nabbed a league-leading 39 opposing baserunners (41.9%) in 1995, second in the NL to Florida Marlins' Charles Johnson, and led the league's catchers with 14 double plays and 63 assists. On August 2, 1997, he was the first catcher to wear the FOX mini-camera, in a Houston-New York Mets game. In 1997, he had 16 double plays, a career best, and led the league in caught-stealing percentage (49.5%), as he threw out 46 of 93 runners. In 1998, he finished second to Charles Johnson in the NL Gold Glove voting.\n\nIn 1999, he led the American League with a .998 fielding percentage. In 2000, Ausmus appeared in 150 games (leading the AL), starting 140 (the most ever by a Detroit catcher). He led the league with 68 assists and 898 putouts, and threw out 30 of 74 baserunners attempting to steal (47.5%), second in the AL in that category. In 2001, he led the NL with a .997 fielding percentage and only one passed ball, had the second-best caught-stealing percentage (47.7%) in the majors, and won the first of two consecutive National League Gold Gloves with the Astros. He led the league again with a .997 fielding percentage and an 8.40 range factor, while being charged with only two passed balls in 2002. In 2003, Ausmus had a .997 fielding percentage, for the third season in a row. He led the league with a .999 fielding percentage, 884 putouts, and 134 games caught in 2005.\n\nAusmus led the league again in a league-leading 138 games caught with a .998 fielding percentage (the fifth-best of any catcher ever at the time) and a 7.94 range factor, with a league-leading 929 putouts and only one passed ball, and won his third Gold Glove in 2006. That year he caught the second-most games ever by a catcher at the age of 37—only Bob Boone, with 147 games, caught more at that age.\n\nHe made his franchise-record eighth Opening Day start at catcher for the Astros in 2007, breaking a tie with Alan Ashby. On July 22 of that year, Ausmus passed Gary Carter to move into sole possession of second place in major league career putouts by a catcher. In addition, he passed Ted Simmons that day to take sole possession of 12th place all-time on the games caught list, with 1,772. In 2007, he had the second-best fielding percentage (.995) and range factor (8.04) of all catchers in the NL, while being charged with only two passed balls.\n\nIn 2008, the Astros named Ausmus as an \"emergency infielder.\" In April, he played second base in the ninth inning of a game, and later in the season he played first base and third base. In 2005, he even played an inning at shortstop. Through 2008, Ausmus ranked ninth all-time in games caught (1,887) and starts at catcher (1,720).\n\nAusmus's 1,141 games at catcher in that decade ranked second in the majors. As of July 12, 2009, he was third all-time among catchers in fielding percentage.\n\nAmong active catchers with at least 600 games played, he finished the 2009 season ranked tied for fourth with a .994 career fielding percentage behind Mike Redmond (.996), Joe Mauer (.996), and A. J. Pierzynski (.995).\n\nAusmus finished his career in 2010 ranked third in major league history with 12,839 putouts as a catcher, trailing only Iván Rodríguez and Jason Kendall, seventh in games caught with 1,938, and 10th in both range factor/game (7.12) and fielding percentage (.994). For his career, he threw out 30.2% of potential basestealers.\n\nIn 2011, Ausmus was named field executive of the San Diego Padres. Ausmus held that position until the season, when he departed for the vacant Detroit Tigers manager position.\n\nOn November 3, 2013, Ausmus was named the 38th manager in the history of the Detroit Tigers, succeeding Jim Leyland. In his first year as manager, Ausmus led the Tigers to a 90–72 record, winning the American League Central division title. The Tigers were ousted in that season's ALDS by the Baltimore Orioles, three games to none. In his second year as manager, the Tigers had a disappointing 74–87 record, finishing in last place in their division. In his third season, the Tigers finished in second place in the AL Central division with an 86–75 record, 2.5 games out of the second postseason Wild Card spot. Shortly after the 2016 season concluded, the Tigers announced they would exercise the fourth-year option on Ausmus's contract, keeping him as manager for the 2017 season.\n\nDuring the 2017 season the Tigers lost 98 games and finished last among all teams. On September 22, 2017, the Tigers opted to not extend Ausmus' four-year contract, announcing he would not return in 2018. He finished his stint with the Tigers with a record of 314 wins and 332 losses in the regular season. He lost all three of his playoff games. Through 2018, he was one of seven Jewish managers in MLB history. The others were Gabe Kapler, Bob Melvin, Jeff Newman, Norm Sherry, Lou Boudreau, and Lipman Pike.\n\nAusmus was a special assistant to Los Angeles Angels general manager Billy Eppler for the 2018 season.\n\nOn October 21, 2018, Ausmus was named the 17th manager in the history of the Los Angeles Angels, replacing Mike Scioscia. He signed a three-year contract, but was dismissed after the conclusion of the 2019 season. He finished with a record of 72 wins and 90 losses.\n\nAusmus managed the Israel national baseball team in the Qualification Round to the 2013 World Baseball Classic from May 2012 through their series in September 2012. Team Israel, under the Classic's rules, was entitled to have non-Israeli citizens of Jewish heritage play for the team. Israel lost to Spain in extra innings in the Pool Finals, missing out on a spot in the World Baseball Classic.\n\nAusmus was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n\"I have had quite a few young Jewish boys who will tell me that I am their favorite player, or they love watching me play or they feel like baseball is a good fit for them because it worked for me, or it worked for Shawn Green or other Jewish players at the Major League level\", said Ausmus. \"It has been a sense of pride. If you can have a positive impact on a kid, I'm all for it.\"\n\nHe appeared on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame 2016 election and earned zero votes.\n\n This chapter in Ruttman's oral history, based on a February 29, 2008 interview with Ausmus conducted for the book, discusses Ausmus's American, Jewish, baseball, and life experiences from youth to the present.\n\n"}

It is charged with overseeing the Federal Reserve Banks and with helping implement the monetary policy of the United States. Governors are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for staggered 14-year terms.\n\nBy law, the appointments must yield a \"fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country\". As stipulated in the Banking Act of 1935, the Chair and Vice Chair of the Board are two of seven members of the Board of Governors who are appointed by the President from among the sitting Governors.\n\nThe terms of the seven members of the Board span multiple presidential and congressional terms. Once a member of the Board of Governors is appointed by the president, he or she functions mostly independently. Such independence is unanimously supported by major economists. The Board is required to make an annual report of operations to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. It also supervises and regulates the operations of the Federal Reserve Banks, and the U.S. banking system in general. The Board obtains its funding from charges that it assesses on the Federal Reserve Banks, and not from the federal budget.\n\nMembership is by statute limited in term, and a member that has served for a full 14 year term is not eligible for reappointment. There are numerous occasions where an individual was appointed to serve the remainder of another member's uncompleted term, and has been reappointed to serve a full 14-year term. Since \"upon the expiration of their terms of office, members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors are appointed and have qualified\", it is possible for a member to serve for significantly longer than a full term of 14 years. The law provides for the removal of a member of the Board by the President \"for cause\".\n\nThe Chair and Vice Chair of the Board of Governors are appointed by the President from among the sitting Governors.

It was located next to Oakland Assembly, then a Chevrolet factory originally built in 1917 by William Durant, which later became part of General Motors.\n\nFageol produced two luxury automobiles, but production was halted when the supply of Hall-Scott SOHC six-cylinder engines was diverted to build airplanes for the World War I effort.\n\nThe first Fageol farm tractor was a re-labeled Hamilton Walking Tractor, designed and built by Rush E. Hamilton of Geyserville, California. As a result of the many tractor performance trials of the day, the tractor was redesigned to be more compatible with the needs of the West Coast. The Fageol version was designed by a team led by Horatio Smith with the cooperation of Hamilton. In about 1923, the tractor business was sold to the Great Western Motors Company of San Jose, with Hamilton and Smith joining Great Western.\n\nIn 1921, Fageol became the first company to build a bus from the ground up. This new style bus was initially called \"Safety Bus\". The goal was to build a bus that was resistant to overturning when cornering. It had a wide track, and was lower to the ground for ease of entry and exit. Following the successful introduction, the vehicles were renamed \"Safety Coaches\", a term intended to imply greater value.\n\nFageol trucks were well built and became favorites of the industry, owing in part to the dual range, mid-mounted transmission. This gearbox allowed for extreme ranges in gearing for slow speed heavy hauling and for highway speeds with lighter loads. These vehicles were easily spotted by the large number \"7\" painted on the front of the radiator.\n\nThe Fageol brothers left the company in 1927 to form the Twin Coach Company, manufacturing buses in Kent, Ohio. The leadership was taken over by company president L.H. Bill, but during the Great Depression the company went into receivership, and the bank assumed control and re-organized the company under the name Fageol Truck and Coach. In 1938, T. A. Peterman bought the factory and its contents. In 1939, the first Peterbilt was produced.\n\nThe South Australian Railways operated a number of Fageol buses. In 1932 that system introduced into service the first of four railcars converted from road buses at Islington Railway Workshops. These vehicles initially operated on the SAR gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway, however some were transferred to operate on the Kingston to Naracoorte line, prior to the line's conversion to broad gauge. Because the buses were not designed for rail use, the ride was very rough. The last railcar was condemned in 1961.\n\nFageol produced tractors, buses and trucks, at least three luxury cars, as well as engines for land vehicles and ships. The company went through several stages, names, and location changes that included \"Fageol Motors Company\", from 1915 to 1932 in Oakland, California; \"Fageol Motor Sales Company\", from 1916 to 1932 in Oakland, California; \"Fageol Truck and Coach Company\", from 1932 to 1938 in Oakland, California; \"Fageol Motors Company of Ohio\", from 1920 to 1922 in Cleveland, Ohio and 1922 to 1926 in Kent, Ohio.\n\nThe brothers had originally sold the Hamilton Walking Tractor, rebranded as the Fageol Walking Tractor, without much success. They were contracted to solve a transportation issue at the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition. The fair covered over 600 acres, with two and a half miles of water front property. From February to December over 18 million people visited the fair. The solution provided by the brothers ended up being the Fageol Auto Train, also called the Trackless Train, powered with a Ford motor, pulling two or three low to the ground 20 passenger open-sided cars. The financial backer chose to use a different spelling, for ease of pronunciation, so the company was registered as \"The Fadgl Auto Train Inc.\"\n\nThis led to the founding of the Fageol Motors Company of Oakland. The company reached an agreement with Rush Hamilton of Geyserville, California to manufacture a tractor with spiked rear wheels.\n\nIn 1950 the company manufactured a unique truck, the TC CargoLiner – touted as \"A Trailer Without A Tractor\". In 1953 the Twin Coach Company was awarded a patent for what would become the standard in straight truck design. The inventor was Louis J Fageol. The company produced 1 1/2 ton, 2 1/2 ton, 3 1/2-4 ton, and 5-6 ton trucks.\n\nSince the founding of Fageol Motors Company, there was a plan to build automobiles. Frank R. and William B. Fageol with Louis H. Bill built and marketed what was to be the most expensive luxury car of the time using the Hall-Scott aircraft engine. Marketed as the \"Fageol Four Passenger Touring Speedster\" only three were known to have been produced before the government took over the engine manufacturing plant to build war planes, ending production. Other cars built by the company were:\n\n\nFageol produced buses until 1953, when the bus-manufacturing portion of the Fageol Twin Coach Company was absorbed by Flxible.\n\n\n"}

Canada was represented by World Hockey Association players instead of the National Hockey League players that played in the 1972 Summit Series. The Soviet team won the series 4–1–3 over Canada. The format was the same as the 1972 Summit Series, with four games across Canada and four in Moscow. Canada's lone victory came at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto.\n\nNegotiations for the event started at the 1974 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, when Andrey Starovoytov of the Soviet Union approached Jack Devine and Gordon Juckes of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association regarding having another series. Initially the event was to be a six-game series, but it was later extended to eight games.\n\nWHA players had been banned from playing in the 1972 series. Bobby Hull, who had just jumped from the NHL to the Winnipeg Jets, had been named to the Canadian team by Harry Sinden, but was not allowed to participate. The 1974 series was an opportunity for Hull and 46-year-old Gordie Howe to play for Canada against the Soviet team. The number one goaltender was Gerry Cheevers who played in seven of the eight games, missing game three to attend the funeral of his father. Goaltenders Don McLeod and Gilles Gratton were the backup goalies for Team Canada. Vladislav Tretiak and Alexander Sidelnikov were the goaltenders for the Soviets, with Tretiak playing in seven of the eight games, missing game eight.\n\nIn 1974, the two-season-old WHA was largely composed of players scavenged from the minor leagues mixed with a few NHL stars and aging veterans. Playing on both the 1972 and 1974 teams for Canada were Paul Henderson, Frank Mahovlich and Pat Stapleton. The last active player from the series was Mark Howe, who retired in 1995. Team Canada players were paid C$6,000 each for participating in the series.\n\nUSSR Wins Series 4–1–3\n\n\nLike it was with the original Summit Series in 1972, CBC and CTV split the coverage, with CTV carrying Games 1, 3, 6 and 7, while CBC aired Games 2, 4, 5 (?) and 8. CTV produced the telecasts. Johnny Esaw called the games for CTV, while Don Chevrier called the action for CBC. Howie Meeker was the colour commentator for all of the games. Both Esaw and Chevrier conducted intermission and post-game interviews during the games either one did not do play-by-play for. In the Soviet Union, coverage was orchestrated by the Ministry of Telecommunications.\nThe first 4 games of the broadcast also featured the Gamerecorder which was the first statistics computer used in professional sports and a print of the Gamerecorder has now been accepted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nIn December 2006, Hockey Canada and the Hockey Hall of Fame approved the release of a 1974 Summit Series boxset. The original master tapes of the series were destroyed long ago, but an unlicensed recording was recently uncovered and donated to the Hockey Hall of Fame. With Video Service Corp, seven of the eight games of the series were released on a 4-DVD set with a 1970s Summit Series documentary as a bonus feature. Game 5 of the series was not included in the boxset as it was mostly lost through poor television transmission and is thought to be lost for good . VSC was the same company that released the boxset for the 1976 Canada Cup.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1838428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838428", "title": "Twin Coach", "text": "Twin Coach\n\nTwin Coach was an American vehicle manufacturing company from 1927 to 1955, located in Kent, Ohio, and a maker of marine engines and airplane parts until the 1960s. It was formed by brothers Frank and William Fageol when they left the Fageol Motor Company in 1927. They established the company in Kent to manufacture and sell buses with a new concept design. The body structure of this new bus was unique in that the body also became the frame and two engines – \"twin\" engines – were used to allow for larger passenger loads. This concept was patented by William B. Fageol.\n\nOver the years, Twin Coach made transit buses, trolley buses, small delivery vehicles, Fageol six-cylinder gasoline/propane bus and marine engines, Fageol four-cylinder marine engines, and aircraft and truck components. The company was sometimes referred to as \"Fageol-Twin Coach\". The company was acquired by Flxible in 1955 and merged with it, but use of the \"Twin Coach\" name in marketing continued for a few years, and the name was briefly revived (as a brand name only) in the late 1960s by a related company called Highway Products, Inc.\n\nTrolley bus production lasted from 1928 to 1951. Notably, the company's very first order and its very last were also its only export orders ever for trolley buses: eight vehicles for Manila, Philippines, in 1928 and four for Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1951. All other orders went to U.S. cities., none to Canadian cities.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Twin Coach was one of the largest producers in the very limited field of trolley bus manufacturing in North America. Until the late 1940s, only three other U.S. companies built more trolley buses: the Brill companies (J.G. Brill and successors ACF-Brill and CCF-Brill), Pullman and St. Louis Car Company. Another builder, Marmon-Herrington, only entered the field in 1946, but eventually surpassed Twin's total. All told, Twin Coach manufactured only 670 \"trolley coaches\" – as such vehicles were commonly called at the time – but sold them to 16 different cities (all in the U.S.), which equates to around one-third of all of the trolley bus systems ever to exist in the United States. Overall, the company's best customer for trolley coaches was the Seattle Transit System, which bought a total of 177, all between 1940 and 1943.\n\nIn 1940, Twin Coach also pioneered the development of the articulated trolley bus in North America, although the first such vehicle in the world was built in Europe slightly earlier, in 1939 (by Isotta Fraschini/Stanga in Italy). The company built only two articulated trolley buses, and each was marketed as a \"Super Twin\" model. Both were originally built as demonstrators. The 1940 unit was eventually sold to the Cleveland transit system and entered service there. The second was built as a gas-powered bus in 1946, but was converted into a trolley bus in 1948, leased to the Chicago Transit Authority and was sold to CTA in 1954. With both vehicles, the articulation joint allowed only vertical, not horizontal, movement. These two prototypes never led to any series production, so each remained unique. The 1948 Chicago vehicle is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum. Until 1985, these two vehicles remained the only articulated trolley buses ever built in North America by \"any\" manufacturer.\n\nTwin Coach also built motor buses (buses powered by internal combustion engines). Fuels included at least gasoline and propane. Between 1927 and 1934 alone, the company built more than 1,100 motor buses, including 21 with gas-electric drive. Bus production continued through to the time of the company's acquisition by Flxible, in the 1950s.\nFor many years the Fageol 'Twin Coach' was used to take passengers from Canada to US (and back) via the 'Detroit-Windsor Tunnel' under the Detroit River.\n\nIn 1955, the bus manufacturing operations were sold to Flxible, which was also based in Ohio. For a time, Flxible used the Twin Coach name – along with its own – in its marketing and some buses carried front name plates that gave both names and combined the companies' two logos into one. By 1963, use of the Twin Coach name on buses had been discontinued.\n\nThe marine-engine and aircraft divisions continued as Twin Coach. In 1958, after selling the marine division to Crofton Manufacturing Company of Los Angeles, the company moved its remaining production to Cheektowaga, New York. In 1962, the company's name was changed to Twin Industries.\n\nA portion of the company called Highway Products produced a number of products, such as small Post Office vehicles, mobile post offices used in rural areas, small boats for military and commercial uses, missile launchers and a variety of other products. Production of a small bus, sold under the \"Twin Coach\" name, began in 1969. In 1970, the company was sold and became a subsidiary of the Alco Standard company, continuing to produce the \"Twin Coach\" and Cortez Motor Homes until its bankruptcy in 1975.\n"}
{"id": "1838430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838430", "title": "Maryland Route 18", "text": "Maryland Route 18\n\nMaryland Route 18 (MD 18) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs from the beginning of state maintenance at Love Point east to MD 213 in Centreville. MD 18 is the main east–west local highway on Kent Island and east to Centreville, serving the centers of Stevensville, Chester, Kent Narrows, Grasonville, and Queenstown that are bypassed by U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301. What is signed as MD 18 is actually a set of four suffixed highways: MD 18A, MD 18B, MD 18S, and MD 18C. There are also several unsigned segments of MD 18 scattered along the length of the signed portions.\n\nWhat is now MD 18 was first paved in the 1910s from Centreville to Queenstown along with short segments in Grasonville and Chester. Gaps in the Stevensville–Queenstown highway were filled throughout the 1920s, leaving only a crossing of Kent Narrows to be completed in the early 1930s. MD 18 between Stevensville and Love Point was constructed in the early 1930s. The Stevensville–Queenstown highway was designated part of MD 404, while the highways on both ends to Love Point and Centreville were designated MD 18. US 50 replaced MD 404 when the former highway was extended east of Annapolis in 1949. When US 50 was relocated as a divided highway between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Queenstown in the early 1950s, MD 18 was assigned to the bypassed highway. Since the mid-1980s, several suffixed sections of MD 18 have been created, relocated, or received new designations due to expansion of US 50 and US 301 to a freeway.\n\nThe mainline of MD 18 consists of four internally suffixed sections. MD 18A runs from Love Point south and east through Stevensville to a roundabout at Castle Marina Road in Chester. MD 18B extends from the same roundabout east through Chester, Kent Narrows, and Grasonville to US 50 in Queenstown. MD 18S has a length of between US 50 and US 301 in Queenstown. MD 18C comprises the easternmost of the highway from US 301 in Queenstown to MD 213 in Centreville.\n\nMD 18A's western terminus is at the beginning of state maintenance on Love Point Road just south of the community of Love Point at the northern end of Kent Island. The state highway heads due south through farmland. After meeting Old Love Point Road at an acute angle, MD 18A passes suburban subdivisions and Kent Island High School. Love Point Road, which is unsigned MD 835C, veers southeast to pass through the Stevensville Historic District, which contains the historic Cray House, the Stevensville Bank building, and Christ Church. MD 18A curves to the southwest as Business Parkway. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway ahead of the intersection with MD 8. MD 8 continues south on the divided highway toward an interchange with US 50 and US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) just east of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge while MD 18A turns east onto Main Street. MD 18A curves around the southern edge of the Stevensville Historic District, intersecting Love Point Road, which is unsigned MD 759B to the south, and the other end of MD 835C (East Main Street). The state highway passes Stevensville Middle School, crosses Cox Creek, and passes the Kent Island Shopping Center before reaching its eastern terminus at a roundabout with Castle Marina Road, which is unsigned MD 18H to the south.\nMD 18B begins at the same roundabout at which MD 18A has its eastern terminus. Piney Creek Road, which is unsigned MD 18T, splits to the east as MD 18B curves southeast and crosses over US 50 and US 301. The state highway curves east again at an intersection with its old alignment, Postal Road, in Chester shortly before an intersection with MD 552 (Dominion Road). MD 18B continues around the south end of Piney Creek before entering the hamlet of Kent Narrows, where the highway has a direct connection to eastbound US 50 and US 301. The state highway also has an indirect connection to the westbound freeway via Piney Narrows Road, where it passes south of a park and ride lot under the freeway serving MTA Maryland commuter buses, immediately before crossing Kent Narrows on a drawbridge adjacent to the US 50 and US 301 crossing of the strait. MD 18B continues east through Grasonville, where the highway intersects Chester River Beach Road (unsigned MD 18V) and Nesbit Road (unsigned MD 835K), both of which provide full access to the freeway. Past Nesbit Road, the road passes southeast of the University of Maryland Shore Emergency Center at Queenstown and the University of Maryland Shore Medical Pavilion at Queenstown. The state highway continues through farmland before reaching its eastern terminus at US 50 (Ocean Gateway) just east of the US 50 – US 301 split in Queenstown. The two highways meet at a superstreet intersection, so there is no direct access between MD 18B and MD 18S on the opposite side of the intersection.\n\nMD 18S begins at US 50 opposite MD 18B's eastern terminus. At the intersection with MD 656 (Friels Road) and Outlet Center Drive, which heads into the Queenstown Premium Outlets, the state highway turns north and reaches its eastern terminus at a superstreet intersection with US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). MD 18C begins at US 301 opposite the eastern terminus of MD 18S. The state highway heads northeast as Main Street through the town of Queenstown, where the highway intersects MD 456 (Del Rhodes Avenue) and passes near the historic home Bowlingly. After leaving the town, MD 18C's name changes to 4-H Park Road and the road passes through farmland. The state highway passes the namesake park of the youth agricultural organization shortly after crossing Reed Creek. MD 18C passes by the historic home Bachelor's Hope before the highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 213 (Centreville Road) on the southwestern edge of Centreville.\n\nThe first sections of MD 18 was paved as three separate state-aid roads within Queenstown and Grasonville by 1915, and between Stevensville and Chester shortly after 1915. The first section paved as a state road was between Centreville and Queenstown by 1919; there were also short pieces of state road paved in Chester and east of Grasonville by 1921. The state road in Chester was extended east to Kent Narrows and the state road near Grasonville was extended west through the village in 1923. The Stevensville–Chester road and the Queenstown–Centreville road were marked as MD 18 by 1927. The road from Stevensville to Love Point was started in 1929 and completed to just south of Love Point in 1930. The highway was extended to its present western terminus by 1933. Pavement was also laid from the west end of Grasonville to Kent Narrows by 1930. The east–west highway between Stevensville and Queenstown was finished with the completion of a timber trestle bascule bridge over Kent Narrows. That highway was marked as MD 404 in 1933; the highways from Stevensville to Love Point and from Queenstown to Centreville remained marked as MD 18.\nWhen US 50 was extended to the Eastern Shore in 1949, it was routed along MD 404 to Wye Mills. The US 50 divided highway started construction in 1950 and was completed between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Queenstown in 1952, including a new drawbridge over Kent Narrows. The 1933 bridge over Kent Narrows was dismantled in 1953. MD 18 was subsequently assigned to old US 50 between Stevensville and Queenstown, following its own alignment except for a concurrency with US 50 and later US 301 over Kent Narrows.\n\nBusiness Parkway was constructed in 1987 as a new alignment and northern extension of MD 8. MD 18 was extended west to Business Parkway and north on the divided highway to bypass the Stevensville Historic District in 1989; the old alignment was designated MD 835C. MD 18 also bypassed the center of Chester in 1989 by the construction of an overpass of US 50 and US 301 just west of MD 552, replacing the intersection at Castle Marina Road. The latter improvement was part of the transformation of US 50 and US 301 to a freeway from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to Queenstown, which was completed in 1991. The upgrade included a new fixed high-level bridge over Kent Narrows for US 50 and US 301, relegating the 1952 drawbridge to be used only by MD 18. In 1999, MD 18 was relocated to the north to use a new roundabout at Castle Marina Road in Chester; the old mainline was designated MD 18R. The MD 18 – US 301 junction in Queenstown was transformed into a superstreet intersection in 2003, resulting in the splitting of the MD 18C designation; MD 18S was assigned to the highway south of the junction.\n\nAs part of the reconstruction of US 50 as a six-lane freeway from US 301 in Queenstown to MD 404 in Wye Mills, the Maryland State Highway Administration plans to construct an overpass of MD 18 over US 50 in Queenstown. MD 18 and US 50 would become connected by a pair of right-in/right-out interchanges. Access to eastbound US 50 would be via a new service road south of US 50 and connections with westbound US 50 would be made through Outlet Center Drive. As of 2011, the project has not been funded.\n\nMD 18 has 12 unsigned auxiliary routes. MD 18F, MD 18I, and MD 18U through MD 18Z are in Grasonville. MD 18G is in Queenstown. MD 18H, MD 18R, and MD 18T are in Chester.\n\n"}

After several decades of substantial finals appearances and a few premiership wins, Sturt entered a period of success, winning seven premierships from 1966 to 1976 under coach Jack Oatey.\n\nSturt has a total of 15 premierships, eleven Magarey Medallists and two Night Premierships.\n\nSturt wear Oxford and Cambridge Blue reflecting the street names on which their home ground is based. Sturt play their home games at the 15,000 capacity Unley Oval and their club song is named \"It's a grand old flag\".\n\nThe club was established in 1901 when the Sturt Cricket Club decided to form a football club in the Unley (suburban Adelaide) area in the Division of Sturt (named after Australian explorer Charles Sturt). The club used the two shades of blue of Oxford and Cambridge Universities as its home ground, Unley Oval, is situated on the junction of Oxford Terrace and Cambridge Terrace, hence the nickname of \"Double Blues\". Sturt played its first game against Norwood, losing by 33 points.\n\nSturt enjoyed little success initially and struggled to make the finals. In 1909, the club was strengthened by a number of interstate players enticed by offers of employment and accommodation and in 1910, Sturt played in their first Grand Final, losing to Port Adelaide.\n\nThe first premiership came in 1915 with a two-goal Grand Final win over Port Adelaide. The competition was suspended during the First World War, being established in 1919 when Sturt faced North Adelaide in the Grand Final. Despite giving up a big lead early, Sturt fought back and forced a draw. In a low scoring replay the following week, Sturt kicked its only three goals of the match in the last quarter (the last coming with thirty seconds remaining) to win by five points (23–18) and secure consecutive premierships four years apart.\n\nSturt won another premiership in 1926 defeating North Adelaide again by 64–51, with Vic Richardson after he was not selected for the 1925 Ashes cricket tour of England.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1941, Sturt played in five Grand Finals, winning in 1932 (v. North Adelaide by 110–69) and 1940 when the team beat South Adelaide (100–79). From 1942 to 1944, Sturt combined with South Adelaide to compete in a restricted wartime competition.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1961, despite the efforts of triple Magarey Medalist Len Fitzgerald, Sturt performed poorly, \"winning\" five wooden spoons and failing to make a Grand Final. In 1962, former Norwood and South Melbourne player and West Adelaide coach Jack Oatey was appointed coach and began to institute an innovative style of play that would modernise the game and influence the style of football played Australia wide.\n\nSturt showed gradual improvement in Oatey's first years, finishing 6th in 1963 and third in 1964. In 1965, it reached the grand final and before 62,543 (a SANFL record until 1976 and the highest Adelaide Oval crowd to this day), fell short by just 3 points against Port Adelaide. In 1966, Sturt gained revenge on Port Adelaide, doubling its score (16.16 to 8.8) winning its first premiership in 26 years and entering a period of dominance that saw them win seven premierships in eleven years, including five in a row between 1966 and 1970.\n\nSturt's 1967 and 1968 grand final wins were again at the expense of Port Adelaide. Sturt won the 1969 Grand Final beating Glenelg who had included the Richmond star Royce Hart for his only game for the club. Hart was eligible to play in the SANFL due to his posting to Adelaide as a National Service soldier. Sturt completed its fifth successive premiership with another win over Glenelg in a rain-affected 1970 grand final.\n\nThe 1976 Grand Final win over Port Adelaide was dominated by ruckman Rick Davies. Before a record Football Park crowd of 66,897, Sturt entered the final as rank outsiders. Davies, sensing early pressure from Port, positioned himself in the back lines in the first quarter. In an often quoted anecdote, coach Jack Oatey turned to runner David ( Daffy ) Edwards and said:'What's he doing down there? I didn't put him down there. I run this side. Go and ask him what he thinks he's up to.\" After Davies had taken his fourth strong mark, Edwards came back with the news: \"He says he's down there getting kicks, that's where the ball is\". Oatey's response: \"Course he is. He’s a champion isn’t he?” Rick Davies dominated the final with 21 kicks, 21 handballs, 21 hit outs and 15 marks, with Sturt winning by 41 points. Captain Paul Bagshaw described the win as \"Sturt’s finest hour\".\n\nJack Oatey's legacy has continued to influence football in South Australia. Since their inception into the AFL, the Adelaide Crows have embodied much of the approach to the game that Oatey pioneered. Oatey is also credited with popularising the checkside punt, a kicking style that causes the ball to bend away from the body. In the 1968 Grand Final against Port Adelaide Football Club, Peter Endersbee used the checkside punt to kick two goals in the space of a few minutes turning the game in Sturt's favour. Since 1981, the Jack Oatey Medal has been awarded to the best player in the SANFL Grand Final.\n\nAfter Oatey's retirement at the end 1982, Sturt under coaches John Halbert and former Richmond star Mervyn Keane reached the Grand Final of 1983 with a reinvented Davies kicking 151 goals, but fluctuated in the following five years. Committee dissatisfaction with Keane, however, led to Sturt churning through five coaches and receiving a SANFL record eight consecutive wooden spoons between 1989 and 1996, including a winless season in 1995 when the team actually did not get within four goals of any of its twenty-two opponents. A joint bid with Norwood in 1994 to enter the AFL was rejected in favour of Port Adelaide. Facing financial difficulties, mergers with South Adelaide (\"Southern Blues\") and North Adelaide were proposed by the SANFL and the club's board. This was opposed by supporters who, along with former players, raised the required $250,000 in two weeks to keep the club in existence. Sturt returned to its original home ground Unley Oval in 1998, having moved its home games to Adelaide Oval from 1986.\n\nUnder Phil Carman, Sturt reached the Grand Final in 1998, losing to Port Adelaide by nine points. Damian Squire was recruited from North Adelaide the following year and won consecutive Magarey medals in 1999–2000. Jade Sheedy and Tim Weatherald went on to share the award in 2002. Sturt, under first-year coach Brenton Phillips, played Central Districts in the 2002 SANFL Grand Final. After struggling to beat Central Districts in four prior attempts in the 2002 season, the Double Blues emerged triumphant on Grand Final day, doubling the Bulldogs' score to win by 47 points. It was the club's first premiership in 26 years.\n\nSix days after the win, several of the club's players and support staff were celebrating the win at the Sari Club in Bali when the Bali bombing incident occurred. Player Josh Deegan and trainer Bob Marshall were killed.\n\nSturt finished fifth in 2010 and 9th in 2011. After champion goal kicker Brant Chambers departed at the end of Season 2010, the club endured disappointing seasons in 2011 and 2012, finishing bottom in each year. Poor results in both seasons plus off field mismanagement resulted in a club debt of $2.2 million and almost saw the club to the grave, as reports in early 2013 stated that the club \"went perilously close to closing its doors\". Sturt finished seventh in 2013, but returned to the finals in 2014 finishing 3rd after the minor round only to lose in straight sets to Norwood and South Adelaide in the Qualifying and 1st Semi Finals. In 2015, Sturt finished 8th with the poor result bringing on the departure of then part-time coach Seamus Maloney. \n\n2016 saw Sturt mount a resurgence under new coach and former premiership player Martin Mattner. The Blues Finished 3rd after the home and away season and started the final series by beating South Adelaide in the Qualifying final. They then lost to the Eagles in the second semi final but won\nthe Preliminary Final against the Adelaide Crows a week later, by 35 points to set up a Grand Final match against Eagles. They then went on to win the 2016 premiership. The following year the Double Blues recovered from a disappointing start to their finals series to claim a thrilling one-point win against Port Adelaide in the 2017 Grand Final, achieving the rare back-to-back premiers feat.\n\nSturt entered a team in the SANFL Women's competition in 2018.\n\nFrom the club's inception in 1901 until 1986, the Sturt Football Club played their home games at the Unley Oval. The largest attendance at Unley was set in Round 9 of the 1968 season when 22,015 crammed into the oval to see Sturt play long time rivals Port Adelaide. The unofficial ground record attendance at Unley was set on 9 June 1924 when an estimated 24,000 saw Sturt play Norwood.\n\nIn 1987 the club moved its home games to the Adelaide Oval, a move that proved unpopular with fans. After the move, the City of Unley turned the oval into a public park by removing the boundary fence, though the Jack Oatey Stand and the Members Stand remained in place. In 1996, the club negotiated with the Unley council for a return to Unley and after playing a couple of games there in 1997, Sturt permanently moved back to their original home in 1998 which coincided with the club's first Grand Final appearance since 1983.\n\nBefore 2014, Sturt was forced to hire Unley Oval for each SANFL home game, due to the councils wish that the oval remain a public park as well as paying for temporary fencing to be erected for each home game. The use of temporary fencing ended in 2014 when a white picket fence was erected at the oval.\n\nUnley Oval was renamed Peter Motley Oval in 2015 in honour of the former two-time Sturt club champion.\n\n\n\nThe Sturt Football Club's song is \"It's A Grand Old Flag\".\n\nSung to tune of \"You're A Grand Old Flag\".\n\n\"It's a Grand old flag, It's a high-flying flag\n\"It's the emblem for me and for you\n\"It's the emblem of the team we love\n\"The team of the old Double Blues\n\"Every heart beats true for the old Double Blues\n\"As we sing this song to you...what do we sing?\n\"Should old acquaintance be forgot\n\"Oh keep your eye on the Old Double Blues!\n\n"}

His parents moved the family to Lowell, Massachusetts when he was eight years old. He was educated in Lowell and apprenticed in a machine shop. In 1848, he moved to Gloucester, New Jersey and worked for Gloucester Machine Works as a journeyman and contractor. In 1852, Pratt moved to Hartford, Connecticut to work at Colt Armory. It was at Colt that he met Amos Whitney. Pratt soon left Colt to work at Phoenix Iron Works and brought Whitney along with him.\n\nWhile still working at Phoenix Iron Works, he designed a milling machine for George S. Lincoln & Company of Hartford, Connecticut, which became the Lincoln miller, in some ways perhaps the most important American machine tool of the late 19th century. Over 150,000 machines were built on this form factor (by many firms).\n\nPratt cofounded the Pratt & Whitney company along with Amos Whitney in 1860. Their first product was a thread winder for the Willimantic Linen Company. They went on to manufacture machine tools, tools for the makers of sewing machines, and gun making machinery for use by the Union Army during the American Civil War. He is credited with being first to permit production of fine gear work. Pratt promoted interchangeable parts and the adoption of a standard system for gages for the United States and Europe. Among several machine-tool patents, his most important was for planing metal granted on July 28, 1869.\n\nHe served as a member of the board of water commissioners for the city of Hartford for four years.

{"id": "1838448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838448", "title": "Fantasy of Flight", "text": "Fantasy of Flight\n\nFantasy of Flight is an aviation-related attraction in Polk City, Florida, United States that takes visitors back to the pioneering days of early flight, as well as the First and Second World Wars and beyond. The attraction opened in November 1995, and houses the world's largest private aircraft collection on display. It became the new home for much of owner Kermit Weeks' collection of aircraft that were previously housed at the Weeks Air Museum in Tamiami, Florida and were damaged to varying degrees by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. On April 6, 2014, the attraction was closed to the public, though it is still being maintained and is available for private events. On January 30, 2015, Fantasy of Flight opened a scaled-down museum attraction to display some of their aircraft to the public in the interim while the rest of the facility is upgraded and planned to reopen sometime in the future.\n\nFantasy of Flight was the only attraction in the world to offer daily aerial demonstrations (weather permitting) of aircraft in its collection. Most of Weeks' aircraft are airworthy and may still be seen flying from one of the facility's grass runways or its seaplane runway. Fantasy of Flight fields more airworthy aircraft than the air forces of Austria, Cuba, Denmark, Kuwait, Portugal, or South Africa. It also fields more airworthy fixed-wing aircraft than either the Royal Navy or the Indian Navy.\n\nThe facility features a main building consisting of two large hangars (called \"North\" and \"South\") for the aircraft on display, restoration shops, the immersion environments, a gift shop, and the Art Deco-themed Compass Rose Diner. Just outside the main building across from the entrance is the facility's new ropes course and zip line attraction known as \"Wing Walk Air.\"\n\nOutside the hangars there is an adjoining tarmac and two grass runways. On the north side of the runways are a maintenance hangar and conference facility. A \"back lot\" to the south of the main complex contains warehouses and storage and restoration facilities. More storage facilities are located across Broadway Blvd and are opened to the public as part of the tour. Lake Agnes is also on the property to allow for seaplane operations, with a designated landing/takeoff area on 18/36 and a ramp to taxiway on the eastern shore.\n\nThe airfield is officially known as the \"Orlampa Inc. Airport\" and uses the airport identifier \"FA08.\" The field sits at an estimated elevation of 129 feet (42 meters). It is designated as private use only and special permission is needed to land there. The field is generally closed to all non-company traffic. The airfield consists of two turf runways: runway 4/22 (5090 x 125 ft. / 1551 x 38 m) and runway 14/32 (2500 x 100 ft. / 762 x 30 m). The airfield appears as \"Orlampa\" on the Jacksonville sectional chart. The name \"Orlampa\" was originated by Kermit Weeks based on the airfield being approximately midway between the cities of Orlando and Tampa.\n\nWaldo Wright's Flying Service offers airplane rides for sale from the Fantasy of Flight field during parts of the year and operates a Boeing PT-17 Stearman and a New Standard D-25. The Stearman is used for 30 minute long 'hands-on experience' flights, in which the customer takes control of the aircraft at some point during the flight. The D-25 is used for 15 minute barnstorming flights, in which up to four customers sit in the forward open cockpit of the aircraft as a qualified pilot flies the aircraft.\n\nThe Fantasy of Flight collection contains the following aircraft, although the aircraft are not always present at the museum. Some are on loan to other facilities, others may be flown to events, and still others may be off display for maintenance or restoration. Most of the collection is contained in the north and south hangars which are now closed to the public, with a smaller portion now on display at the interim museum attraction housed in the old maintenance hangar. In 2012, the \"Golden Hill\" storage facility attraction opened just across the road from the main facility. A number of aircraft have been re-located into this new building, notably the B-23 Dragon and the B-29 Superfortress nose section, while the buildings were re-arranged in order to allow visitor access, but this section was part of the main facility closure in 2014.\n\n\nThe immersion environments are part of the main facility now closed to the public, but are available as part of the facilities which can be rented for events. Visitors walk through several immersion environments as they enter the attraction. From the lobby, guests walk into the interior of a World War II-era Douglas C-47 Skytrain complete with lighting and sound effects as if the aircraft were conducting paratrooper operations. Guests pass a seated paratrooper in full kit and move forward toward the Jumpmaster figure standing at the open side hatch. Over the hatch blinks a red \"Ready\" light which switches to a green \"Jump\" light as the guest approaches the hatch. Through the hatch is the entry to the attraction.\n\nOther immersion environments include a \"sensation of flight\" simulator, followed by a celebration of the early days of flight. Then, a passage covered by heavy shrapnel-resistant curtains leads visitors into a full-scale representation of the trench warfare of World War I, complete with aircraft overhead. It was, in part, due to the development of aerial warfare that trench fighting became obsolete.\n\nThe final immersion display includes the collection's Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress housed in a large darkened room staged to appear as a winter evening at RAF Horham, home of the 95th Bombardment Group (Heavy) during World War II. The full-scale diorama, complete with ground vehicles, outbuildings, and landscaping, represents a maintenance area and one of the B-17's engine cowlings and propellers are removed to maintenance stands in front of the aircraft. Guests can enter the plane via the aft side hatch in the tail, walk through the bomb bay, visit the cockpit, and exit near the nose of the aircraft.\n\nFor years Fantasy of Flight has maintained a storage building opposite the main property on the north side of Broadway Boulevard where aircraft awaiting restoration were stored. In late 2011, work began on a second building to double the storage space with the intention of spreading out the stored items a bit and opening the buildings to the public on a limited basis. Finally, in June 2011 preparations were sufficient to open one building for a special preview over the Father's Day holiday. The response to the limited, self-guided experience was overwhelmingly positive, and the building joined the attraction's public programming in the summer of 2012, with the second building scheduled to open shortly thereafter.\n\nThe buildings are known by Fantasy of Flight as the \"Golden Hill\" facility as a tongue in cheek reference to the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility of the National Air and Space Museum which is nicknamed \"Silver Hill\" by the NASM staff. Fantasy of Flight guest access to the Golden Hill facility is via over-the-road trolley operated from the main parking lot in the mornings. Guests are allowed to explore the facility on their own with docents present to answer questions. The facility closes at midday due to the lack of comfortable air handling equipment in the steel buildings which can get hot in the Florida sun.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Kermit Weeks and a crew from Fantasy of Flight flew to Cotswold Airport in the United Kingdom to evaluate a Douglas C-47 Skytrain for possible purchase. The aircraft has a distinguished war record including sorties during the D-Day invasion and Operation Market Garden.\n\nAt the end of July, Weeks went forward with the purchase. His crew conducted minor repairs and the plane, registration number N1944A, was flown back to the United States by Weeks and his crew. Due to weather delays on some legs of the trip, the journey took a total of 11 days and covered approximately 4500 miles from Kemble, UK to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Fans of the aircraft, Kermit Weeks, or Fantasy of Flight were able to watch the trip documented daily on Fantasy of Flight's Facebook page as the crew sent back pictures and observations along the way.\n\nThe aircraft arrived without incident on August 4, 2011 at Oshkosh. It was on display at the EAA AirVenture Museum for several months before being moved permanently to the campus of Fantasy of Flight in Polk City. On May 1, 2012, the C-47 was finally flown south to Fantasy of Flight, arriving on May 2 after an overnight stop in Douglas, Georgia. The aircraft is now on display at the attraction and open to guest walk-throughs.\n\nStanding along the side of Interstate 4 near the exit for Fantasy of Flight is a Douglas DC-3 painted with the attraction's name to get the attention of passers by. The aircraft itself is not part of the collection and was, in fact, specifically purchased for its intended purpose as an attraction sign. The airframe is far too corroded to make restoration of the DC-3 feasible. The aircraft was displayed for a period of time in a 'crashed' position, nose down in the ground with a mannequin hanging from the tail wheel, apparently a 'man' evacuating the aircraft with a parachute. The mannequin was dressed up for certain occasions around the year, including Santa Claus for Christmas; Uncle Sam for Independence Day; and a Pilgrim for Thanksgiving.\n\nThe aircraft in this crashed position received a mixture of criticism and compliments. Some people claimed that the display made the aircraft look bad and set a bad example to airline passengers without an aviation background, while others found the position of the aircraft comical and many enjoyed guessing what the mannequin would be dressed as next. Currently, the aircraft is in an upright position with the mannequin seated in the opened cockpit hatch on the left hand side.\n\nAdjacent to the attraction's lobby is an Art Deco themed restaurant called \"The Compass Rose Diner\" which features the characteristics of diners associated with airports during the 1930s and early 1940s. The restaurant features tall windows, multi-hued terrazzo floors, and the curved architectural lines associated with the Art Deco period. The diner was open to the public and served a short-order menu similar to that of lunch counters popularized during the pre-World War II era. When the main facility was closed to the public in 2014, the diner was closed and much of its equipment sold off, though the space itself is still available as part of the venue's rental offerings.\n\nOn March 4, 2014, Fantasy of Flight announced that they would close to the public after April 6, 2014 but continue to stage private events. They further announced that they would reopen to the public in late 2014 as a scaled-down museum, with reduced admission prices, while they simultaneously begin to design and build the main facility into more of a destination attraction that would appeal to a wider audience rather than just aviation aficionados. Ironically, the announcement that the facility would soon be closing its doors to the public has caused a significant upswell in visitors. Crowds have been so large that the facility has had to make use of its overflow parking area on multiple occasions since the announcement. As of 2017 the museum is open on Fridays, Saturdays, and most Sundays.\n\n"}

This also involves significant attention being given to the Inquisition and to its ramifications for Sephardic Jews as well as for the general Jewish community. \n\nMembership in the SCJS is composed of scholars interested in crypto-Jews, descendants of crypto-Jews, and others interested in the topic from a historical, sociological, anthropological, religious, ethnic, literary, philosophical, or other perspective. The Society is nonreligious, and membership is open to all. Today, there is much interest, both academic and personal, in the history and contemporary status of crypto-Jews, and a number of distinguished scholars have published in the area. Especially in recent years, a number of people, especially, but not limited to, Hispanics, have returned or converted to Judaism, frequently in part because of knowledge of a previously-suppressed Jewish heritage. New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, and California are major areas of interest, but significant interest also is found in Miami, Florida, Orlando, Florida, New York City, Portland, Oregon, and other areas with large numbers of Hispanics. This contemporary phenomenon of returning/converting also is of specific interest to some academic researchers.\n\nThe SCJS publishes \"HaLapid\": The Journal of the Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies, a combination newsletter and journal. Published four times per year, \"HaLapid\" (Hebrew for The Torch) mostly includes refereed academic research articles, personal stories by descendants of crypto-Jews, and news items, but also includes occasional poetry, links for related websites, and other items of interest. The SCJC also hosts a website, and helps answer questions and make referrals for interested persons.\n\nThe Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies meets annually for a three-day conference which includes a keynote speaker, sessions on recent research findings, personal stories of returnees, business sessions, and various forms of entertainment. At the 2003 annual conference in San Antonio, Texas, the keynote speaker was retired Rabbi Samuel Lerer who spent much of his 51-year career working with anusim in Mexico. The SCJS has taken a lead in interest in DNA studies, especially as it applies to crypto-Jews, other Sephardim, and the Jewish community in general.\n\n\n"}

They have issued two studio albums, \"Totem\" (March 1995) and \"Iconoclast\" (July 2009). Currently the third studio album titled \"Sumus Inferno\" is in the works with the lineup being Adrian Henderson on guitar, Lachlan Mitchell on keyboards and guitar, John McLaughlin on drums and Dalibor Backovic on vocals and bass guitar.\n\nNazxul were formed in 1993 by guitarist Adrian Henderson, keyboards player-guitarist Lachlan Mitchell, former Mortal Sin and Slaughter Lord drummer Steve Hughes and Dalibor Backovic on vocals and bass guitar. Originally envisioned as a mysterious studio-bound project, the group only appeared in publicity photos as shadowy figures or draped facelessly in cloaks.\n\nIn 1994 a self-titled demo album appeared through Vampire Records. According to Voltage Media's reporter it was \"met with a mixture of astonishment and ultimate praise from critics, allegiance and enthusiasm by extreme music disciples, and revulsion by the ignorant and myopic.\" Soon after guitarist Greg Morelli, from Sydney thrash band Grungeon, joined the fold and work began on the band's first album 'Totem' which went on to become a cult classic. Though reviews were mixed, it was ultimately praised throughout the underground as a unique and powerful debut.\n\nFurther material was written, during which time Backovic departed and two new members joined, singer Morte from an avant-garde black metal group called Bestianity and guitarist Rev. Kriss Hades from the notorious Sydney death metal band Sadistik Exekution who were experiencing one of their well-known self-imposed dormant periods. This line-up produced the EP \"Black Seed\" in 1998 and late in the year played live for the first time at a show in Sydney, with Henderson moving to bass guitar.\n\nHughes left the group after this to pursue a career in stand-up comedy and soon left Australia to live in the UK. His replacement was Peter Kostic from Sydney rock band Front End Loader. Almost immediately, Nazxul was booked to support Finnish extreme metal group Impaled Nazarene on part of an Australian tour. In a remarkable turn of events, Kostic's other band was then approached to tour with British rock group Skunk Anansie over the same period but declined due to the drummer's commitment to Nazxul; the Skunk Anansie tour was in turn cancelled when the group suddenly split up. Morte was fired after this tour and Backovic returned for Nazxul's appearance at the Metal for the Brain festival. In the meantime, \"Black Seed\" was re-released with several live tracks recorded during the tour added to the track listing. The cover was slightly amended with the iconography rendered in gold instead of green.\n\nAfter playing a final show for the year all activity from Nazxul then appeared to cease abruptly. Kostic joined Regurgitator in 2000 and the Hard Ons in 2001. Hades recorded two more albums with Sadistik Exekution before embarking on a solo career. Mitchell continued his work as a professional sound engineer / producer and in late 2001 formed a rock band Brace with several former members of Canberra group Henry's Anger. Backovic left Nazxul in 2000 to pursue a career in the film industry as a screenplay writer and director. In 2002, Sydney black metal label Decius released a limited-edition live album (titled simply \"Live\") on 12\" vinyl. The recording was of the group's 1999 Metal for the Brain performance. A year later, the Nazxul track \"Apostasies Legions Arise, Xul!\" appeared on a compilation release from Hiberica Records along with tracks from American band Krieg, Necroplasma from Sweden and Goat Semen from Peru.\n\nThe band was not at an end however. Four tracks of dark ambience, recorded by Henderson, Mitchell and Morelli, were released on a split EP with Melek Tha in 2004. The same year, Nazxul regrouped with a new line-up that included Henderson, Morelli and Mitchell plus two former members of Wollongong black metal band Secretain, Daniel Lomas (vocals) and Luke Mills (guitar), and drummer Tim Yatras from another Wollongong band called Battalion. Originally booked to tour with Dimmu Borgir, the Norwegian band cancelled its visit but several months later Nazxul undertook a tour with Adelaide based gothic metal band Virgin Black instead. Nazxul then became dormant for some time since. Mills continued to play in various black metal bands and Yatras was the drummer with Lord between 2005 and May 2009.\n\nIn 2008 Nazxul reformed and were listed as the national support to the Australian leg of Mayhem's tour; this tour was cancelled however. The band completed work on the long-awaited \"Iconoclast\" album, first mooted in 1998, during the year. Greg Morelli died in a motorcycle accident on 20 November 2008 in North Strathfield. He had just completed his guitar parts for the album, before his death. Nazxul asked those who listen to \"Oath (Tides Resurrection)\" to think of Morelli: it is performed in his honour.\n\n\"Iconoclast\" was released in July 2009 by German label Eisenwald Records. Guitarist Petar Peric from Infernal Method replaced the late Morelli, and drummer John McLaughlin replaced Tim Yatras.\n\nInternational touring went ahead at the end of 2009 with shows in England, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Russia.\n\nIn 2015, the band regrouped to begin work on a new album titled \"Sumus Inferno\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Nazxul Facebook\nSeance Records Website\nSeance Records Facebook\n"}

After GM completely acquired the company in 1943, it was merged with GM's truck division to form the GM Truck & Coach Division.\n\nThe car rental subsidiary (known both as \"Hertz Drivurself Corp\" and \"Yellow Drive-It-Yourself\") was purchased back by John Hertz in 1953 through The Omnibus Corporation and floated the following year as The Hertz Corporation.\n\nJohn D. Hertz and associates began acquiring smaller Chicago-area companies involved in bus-building in 1922, and soon assembled a manufacturing site covering four square blocks. Yellow Coach Manufacturing Co was formally established in 1923 as a subsidiary of Hertz's Yellow Cab Company, and sold 207 buses in its first year.\n\nGeorge J. Rackham, whose career had commenced with the London General Omnibus Company after the First World War, spent the years 1922–1926 in the U.S., and recognised the advantage of low swept chassis frame for bus development while employed by Yellow. It is likely that he was recruited by Hertz to help start up the bus building business. In 1926, he returned to England to join Leyland Motors as Chief Engineer and was responsible for the groundbreaking Titan and Tiger models.\n\nGeneral Motors purchased a controlling stake in the company in 1925 and changed the name to the Yellow Truck & Coach Manufacturing Company, and relocated production to Pontiac West Assembly in Pontiac, Michigan. Within the transit industry, the company continued to be called simply \"Yellow Coach\".\n\nIn the 1930s, Yellow Coach produced best-selling models for the rapidly expanding urban transit and intercity bus businesses. (In 1935, national intercity bus ridership climbed 50% to 651,999,000 passengers, surpassing the volume of passengers carried by the Class I railroads for the first time. ) Yellow Coach played a significant role in the transition from electric streetcars (operating on rails, powered by overhead wires) to transit companys' use of gasoline- or diesel-powered buses operating on rubber wheels (changing from solid wheels to pneumatic tires). For Greyhound Lines, the largest operator of intercity bus service, Yellow Coach developed distinctive streamlined models which introduced a high floor, underfloor luggage storage, a flat front, air conditioning, and a diesel engine, supplying more than 1,250 buses during Greyhounds' years of fastest growth.\n\nGM purchased the company outright in 1943, merging it into their GM Truck Division to form GM Truck & Coach Division. Although GM continued with the Yellow Coach T-series and P-series product lines, the Yellow Coach badge gave way to the GM Coach or just GM nameplate in 1944. Widespread production of Yellow Coach designs—including certain ZIS buses produced in the Soviet Union—continued until 1959. Limited production of the two remaining small-capacity \"Old Look\" models (3101/3102 and 3501/3502) would continue until 1969. GMC badges did not appear until 1968.\n\nThe company owned a subsidiary, known as either Hertz 'Drivurself Corp' or 'Yellow Drive-It-Yourself' which was sold with Yellow Coach to General Motors and eventual purchased back by Hertz in 1953 with The Omnibus Corporation which was then renamed The Hertz Corporation the following year.\n\nYellow started its model designation at the end of the alphabet and worked forward. Initially four types were offered:\nAll were conventional front-engine design vehicles powered by Yellow Knight I4 sleeve-valve gasoline engines, or a General Electric gas-electric hybrid unless noted otherwise. The Knight engine was connected to the rear wheels by a mechanical drive shaft. In gas-electric models, a gasoline engine in front supplied electric power to two large electric motors mounted on the rear axle.\n\nIn 1931, Yellow Coach introduced its 700 series buses, featuring one of the first bus designs to mount the engine in the rear. Mounting the engine in the rear represented a significant innovation, reducing mechanical losses, noise, and weight of a long drive shaft and exhaust running between a front engine and the rear drive and tailpipe. Bus manufacturers in Germany and the United Kingdom would not perfect rear-engine models until the 1950s. Customers did not always prefer rear-engined designs, noting that front engines were easier to access, and placed engine noise and vibration away from passengers and sometimes outside the coach body. Eventually, the 700 series included both front- and rear-engined models.\n\nIn 1934, Dwight Austin, patent-holder on an innovative rear-drive system, was hired by Yellow Coach and soon developed new models in the 700-series with transverse engines and a “V” angle drive. The V-drive and other innovations introduced in the 700 series would become long-lasting standards: air conditioning, diesel engines, a flat front, a high passenger floor (with luggage beneath), and unibody construction. The V-drive would be GM's standard configuration until the 1980s.\n\nNotable 700-series versions include models \"718\" and \"728\" which were developed for use as urban transit. Model 718 sold 426 units to large transit operators in New York and Los Angeles, becoming the most popular transit bus of the early 1930s. Later model \"728\" sold 1,189 units to transit operators across 9 variants produced in the late 1930s. Both were exclusively rear-engined.\n\nFor Greyhound Lines, an operator of intercity bus service, Yellow Coach developed model \"719\" in 1936 which introduced the high floor, underfloor luggage storage, a flat front and streamlined styling. In 1937, model 719 was revised to become model \"743\" and introduced air conditioning and a diesel engine. Models 719 and 743 were both branded as the \"Super Coach\" by Greyhound, and sales were effectively limited to Greyhound and its affiliates. Greyhound Lines purchased all 1,256 units of model 743 produced between 1937 and 1939.\n\nAll models are wide single-deck buses, except as noted.\nThe Model 1200 series was launched in 1938 with the re-designation of Model 739 as Model 1203 for Public Service Corporation. The 6-model series name ended when three were given new P-series names, and another was given a T-series name.\n\nBy 1940, Model 1200 series designs were renamed into either the \"T\"- or \"P\"-series. The new model designations indicated type, fuel, propulsion (for transit) or customer (for parlor), seating capacity, and version number. (The first was -01, the second, -02, and so on.)\n\nAll \"T\"-series models were urban transit buses. The model designation consisted of two or three letters followed by four numbers. These gave a basic description of the type of bus:\n\nThe \"P\" indicated that, as \"parlor coaches\", the P-series was primarily designed for the seated comfort of intercity bus passengers. All models are wide rear-engine parlor coaches.\n\nIn 1944, General Motors completed its acquisition and merger of Yellow Coach. The T-Series and P-Series production and series numbering continued under the GM and GMC bus brands, along with other variants such as B-Series school buses and S-Series suburban buses. Yellow Coach designs would continue to be widely-produced until 1959, when GM introduced its New Look models. The last Yellow Coach design ceased production in 1969.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1838483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838483", "title": "Fiat G.50", "text": "Fiat G.50\n\nThe Fiat G.50 \"Freccia\" (\"Arrow\") was a World War II Italian fighter aircraft developed and manufactured by aviation company Fiat. Upon entering service, the type became Italy’s first single-seat, all-metal monoplane that had an enclosed cockpit and retractable undercarriage. On 26 February 1937, the G.50 conducted its maiden flight. During early 1938, the \"Freccias\" served in the \"Regia Aeronautica\" (the Italian Air Force) and with its expeditionary arm, the \"Aviazione Legionaria\", in Spain, where they proved to be relatively fast and very manoeuvrable in comparison to its adversaries in the theatre.\n\nEarly in the Second World War, it was determined that the G.50 possessed inadequate armament, comprising a pair of Breda-SAFAT machine guns. The fighter was extensively used on various fronts by Italy, including in Northern Europe, North Africa, the Balkans, and the Italian mainland. The G.50 commonly came up against the British Hawker Hurricane, which was fast enough to frequently outrun and out-range the Italian opponent. Later models of the fighter had improvements, including a substantial increase in range.\n\nThe G.50 was exported to several overseas customers, small numbers being flown by the Croatian Air Force while 35 G.50 fighters were shipped to Finland, where they served with distinction during both the Winter War of 1940 and the Continuation War of 1941–1944 against the Soviet Union. In Finnish service, the type reportedly achieved an unprecedented kill/loss ratio of 33/1.\n\nThe Fiat G.50 had its origins in a design produced by Italian aeronautics engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli. This represented a major change for Fiat, who previously relied on chief engineer Celestino Rosatelli. External to Gabrielli's influence, the fighter's design was also shaped by the issuing of a specification during 1936 which sought a modern interceptor aircraft for the \"Regia Aeronautica\" (the Italian Air Force).\n\nGabrielli started work on the design in April 1935. The design was state-of-the-art for the era; on its introduction, it would become the most advanced fighter to be produced in Italy. Construction of two prototypes began mid-summer 1936. Manufacturing was turned over to CMASA (Costruzioni Meccaniche Aeronautiche S.A.), a subsidiary of Fiat at Marina di Pisa.\n\nOn 26 February 1937, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. Flown by Comandante Giovanni de Briganti, the chief test pilot for the G.50 program, it took off from Caselle airfield, Turin. During this flight, the prototype was recorded as having attained a top speed of as well as having climbed to an altitude of meters in the space of six minutes, 40 seconds. During October 1937, it was officially unveiled to the public at the Milan International Aeronautical Show.\n\nAs a consequence of its new design, it was decided to conduct an extended flight evaluation programme in order to validate its performance. During 1937, along with the first pre-series machines, a \"gruppo sperimentale\" (experimental group) was formed. Early flying experiences with the G.50 revealed it to possess relatively light controls and to be extremely manoeuvrable for a monoplane in comparison with prior designs. However, two separate issues were also identified, the limited power output of its radial engine and the lack of firepower, consisting of only a pair of machine guns.\n\nDuring September 1937, Fiat received an order for an additional batch of 45 aircraft. In advance of the placement of a larger order, the Italian Air Ministry decided to hold a round of comparative 'fly-off' test flight between the type and the newly developed Macchi MC.200. On 8 November 1937, de Briganti was killed during the sixth evaluation flight of the second prototype (M.M.335), when the fighter failed to pull out of a high-speed dive. Flight tests conducted at Guidonia showed that the aircraft went too readily into an uncontrolled spin, a highly dangerous trait, especially at low level where recovery was impossible.\n\nDuring a visit by the Italian King Victor Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, another tragedy occurred at Guidonia. While performing a low, fast pass, three G.50s flown by experienced pilots, \"Maggiore\" (Squadron Leader) Mario Bonzano and Lieutenants Beretta and Marasco, got into difficulty. Beretta's aircraft spun uncontrollably and crashed into the ammunition laboratory, killing the pilot. Despite the crashes, overall results from the flight test programme were deemed to be satisfactory and the \"Freccia\" proved to be more manoeuvrable than the faster Macchi MC.200, and the G.50 was declared the winner of the \"Caccia I\" (\"Fighter One\") competition on 9 June 1938. On account of its manoeuvrability, the \"Regia Aeronautica\" Commission decided to order the G.50 as well, rejecting the competition's third contender, the IMAM Ro.51.\n\nThe first production aircraft were delivered to the \"Regia Aeronautica\" in early 1939. Reportedly, Italian pilots did not like the enclosed canopy because it could not be opened quickly and, being constructed from plexiglas of relatively poor quality, was prone to cracking or abrasion by sand or dust, limiting visibility. In addition, exhaust fumes tended to accumulate in the cockpit, so pilots would often fly the fighter with the canopy locked open. Consequently, an open cockpit was installed in the second batch of 200 machines.\n\nAfter 1939, the bulk of production for the G.50 was transferred to the CMASA factory in Marina di Pisa, Tuscany. The first versions of the G.50 could be outfitted with several different configurations of armaments: either a single, or a pair of, (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns in the nose and an additional pair of (.303 in) Breda-SAFAT in the wings. Later versions of the aircraft could be distinguished by the addition of a larger rudder.\n\nDuring 1938, the \"Regia Aeronautica\" requested that two-seat trainer variant of the G.50 be developed, designated \"G.50/B\" (\"Bicomando\" – dual control). The first of these were constructed during the second half of 1939. The student pilot sat in the front in a closed cockpit with two roll bars. The first five aircraft were part of the \"1a serie\" (\"first series\"). Further production was entrusted to CMASA, who completed 106 G.50/Bs. A single G.50/B was later transformed into a reconnaissance aircraft, which was equipped with a planimetric camera. Another G.50/B was adapted with a tailhook for the purpose of operating as a naval reconnaissance aircraft from the aircraft carrier \"Aquila\", but this vessel was never completed.\n\nDuring September 1940, a slightly improved version, designated as the \"G.50 bis\". The primary advantage was the extended combat range, which was provided by an additional tank, increasing its range from to .\n\nThe ultimate version of the fighter was the \"G.50/V\" (\"Veloce\" – fast) built in mid-1941 by CMASA and equipped with a Daimler-Benz DB 601 engine of 1,075 CV. During tests at Fiat Aviazione's airfield in Turin, it reached a top speed of in level flight and climbed to in five minutes 30 seconds. By this time, however, Gabrielli had already designed the Fiat G.55, and Fiat had obtained the licence to build the 1,475 CV Daimler Benz 605, so the G.50/V was used to test new equipment and then scrapped.\n\nIn total, production of the G.50 reached 784 aircraft; 426 of which having been manufactured by Fiat Aviazione and another 358 being built by CMASA. There were 58 fighters that were recorded as export sales: 13 G.50s had been sold to Spain, along with 35 aircraft to Finland and a final 10 to Croatia.\n\nTwo of the G.50 aircraft to be delivered were destroyed due to a lack of fuel before arriving in Finland. On 7 March, sergeant Aster Wallius forgot to switch the fuel pump to the main tank and the G.50 (FA-8) crashed, injuring the pilot. On 8 March, a Hungarian volunteer pilot, 2nd lieutenant Wilmos Belassy, apparently dived into the Baltic sea, after running out of fuel and failing to cross it from Sweden to Finland. The FA-7 and pilot have not been found. His fellow pilot, 2nd lieutenant Matias Pirity, had turned back and saved both the G.50 and himself.\n\nThe Fiat G.50 was a low-wing single-engine monoplane fighter interceptor aircraft. It featured all-metal construction, comprising a semi-monocoque fuselage with an exterior skin composed of light alloys. The structure of the fuselage was formed from four main longerons and 17 formers, closing into a load-bearing bulkhead forming the rear of the fuselage. The wings were divided into three separate sections, composed of a steel tube centre-section structure that was paired with duralumin outer wings and an alloy skin. The ailerons, which were both statically and aerodynamically balanced, had a metal structure covered by fabric. Hydraulically-actuated four-piece slotted-flaps were fitted to the aircraft's wings to improve its take-off and landing performance; these would automatically retract upon attaining a certain airspeed.\n\nThe G.50 was equipped with retractable landing gear, consisting of inwardly-retracting mainwheels and a fixed, castoring tailwheel. It was the first front-line Italian fighter to be fitted with a retractable undercarriage, an enclosed cockpit, and a constant speed propeller; these improvements have been credited with enabling the G.50 to achieve a maximum speed that was faster than its contemporary, the Fiat CR.42 biplane. According to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, the G.50 was a \"robust and viceless aircraft which marked the introduction of new concepts and techniques, of design and manufacture\".\n\nPowered by a single Fiat A.74 R.C.38 14-cylinder air-cooled supercharged radial engine, rated at for take-off and at , enclosed in a NACA cowling and mounted upon a chrome-molybdenum steel tubular structure attached with flexible mounts. Access for maintenance of the engine was provided via large cowling doors and panels on the fuselage aft of the firewall gave access for fuel tanks and armament. The engine incorporated a reduction gear which drove the Hamiliton-Fiat 3-bladed all-metal constant speed propeller.\n\nThe pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit under a sliding transparent canopy; the seat was adjustable both in height and angle of inclination to suit the pilot's preferences. Despite the canopy possessing favourable transparency, including a relatively unobstructed rearward view, pilots were unenthusiastic about the enclosed arrangement, leading to various types of open canopies being trialled and eventually a set of hinged transparent side-flaps were standardised upon.\n\nA reflector sight was present for the purpose of aiming the fighter's armament, which comprised a pair of 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns with 300 rounds of ammunition per gun. The machine guns, fitted directly forward of the cockpit, were fired using synchronisation gear to fire through the propeller arc; both single-shot and salvo-fire modes were available.\n\nDuring 1938, the first operational Fiat G.50 fighters were delivered to the \"Regia Aeronautica\". During the Spanish Civil War, about a dozen G.50s were dispatched to Spain to reinforce the \"Aviazione Legionaria\", Italy's contribution to the conflict. The first of these were delivered to the theatre during January 1939. The value of its presence in the Spanish theatre is questionable as none of the fighters sent saw actual combat. At the civil war's end, the G.50s in the region were handed over to Spanish pilots and subsequently saw action in Morocco. Cattaneo summarised of the experience: \"Little seems to have been learnt as nothing was done to increase the armament\".\n\nUpon the G.50's entry to service, it was widely regarded as being an extremely manoeuvrable aircraft and was often considered to be one of Italy's best fighters. However, by the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, rapid advancements in the field of aviation had contributed to the type being considered to be both underpowered and underarmed in comparison to competing frontline fighters then in use by the main powers. In spite of this, in the buildup to the Second World War, further units of the \"Regia Aeronautica\" were equipped with newly delivered G.50s; these were heavily used in various exercises and war-games from November 1939 onwards as it became increasingly clear that Italy would likely soon be at war with the Western democracies.\n\nUpon Italy's entry into the Second World War in June 1940, the \"Regia Aeronautica\" possessed a total of 118 G.50s that were available for operations; of these, 97 aircraft were available to perform front line duties while others were either in maintenance or awaiting delivery. The majority of these were assigned to 51° \"Stormo\", (group) which was based at Ciampino Airport (just outside Rome) and at Pontedera, with 22° \"Gruppo\" (wing) of 52° \"Stormo\". On 10 June 1940, when Italy issued its declaration of war against both France and Great Britain, the G.50s of 22° \"Gruppo\" went into action, followed by the 48 aircraft of 20° \"Gruppo\". Operations during the first few days were sporadic and varied, often serving as escorts for Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers on attack missions against harbours and airfields on the island of Corsica. These operations were quickly brought to an end when France signed the Armistice of 22 June 1940, officially capitulating to the Axis powers.\n\nDuring September 1940, the 20°\" Gruppo\" (351/352/353 Squadrons), commanded by \"Maggiore\" Bonzano and equipped with Fiat G.50, was part of 56° \"Stormo\", formed to operate during the Battle of Britain as part of the \"Corpo Aereo Italiano\" (Italian Air Corps, CAI) based in Belgium, together with the 18° \"Gruppo\" flying Fiat CR.42s. According to Cattaneo, the Italian government had decided to participate in the German air offensive against the British mainland due to political opportunism and in pursuit of prestige; he alleged that the Air Staff would have rather directed those aircraft towards other fronts where they would have stood a better chance of making a meaningful contribution.\n\nIn this theatre, the G.50 was normally hampered by its relatively slow speed, open cockpits and short range. Cattaneo also noted that the presence of poor weather conditions and the use of relatively unprepared personnel were additional factors that undermined the fighter's effectiveness. Those G.50s that were deployed were early models and thus furnished with an open canopy, which was useful in a typical Mediterranean climate but led to the pilots suffer heavily in the colder weather of northern Europe. The aircraft was also under-equipped, provided with a mediocre radio set (powered by batteries that were prone to freeze at altitude) and lacking any armour protection. \n\nThe experiences of the early G.50s over Britain soon showed their inadequacies in combat. Their operations were considered to be next to useless during the campaign, in part because they were too short-ranged and stationed too far from enemy territory. The G.50 possessed relatively limited endurance, thus missions rarely exceeded one hour. The G.50 bis, which was equipped with larger fuel tanks, was already in production, but it was not sent to 20° \"Gruppo\" in time to participate. Its performance was also lacking: during one incident on 5 November 1940, a formation of 22 G.50s intercepted several British Hawker Hurricanes, resulting in the RAF fighters escaping with ease. On 21 November 1940, when a Bristol Blenheim attacked the airfield at Maldegem, Belgium, a pair of G.50s were scrambled, but they lost the bomber in the clouds. On 23 November, several G.50s followed a flight of four Hurricanes, but were unable to close on them. On 31 January 1941, another fruitless interception occurred when a number of G.50s were evaded by a single Blenheim that escaped into the clouds.\n\nAt the beginning of 1941, the CAI were redeployed back to Italy, leaving behind a pair of G.50 squadrons that stayed in Belgium alongside \"Luftflotte 2\" until April 1941. Overall, the G.50s flew a total of 429 missions, 34 escorts and 26 scrambles for the CAI, but failed to engage any enemy aircraft during these actions. A single aeroplane was lost and seven more were damaged during the deployment. While operating with \"Luftflotte 2\", 20° \"Gruppo\" lost four additional fighters and two pilots were killed. A pair of G.50s were recorded as having been damaged by friendly fire from German fighters and flak.\n\nIn Belgium, 20° \"Gruppo\" had the opportunity to see the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 in action; several G.50 pilots are known to have been trained to fly the type as well. Around the same time, a pair of Bf 109E pilots were attached to the \"Gruppo\" in mid-January 1941. On 8 April 1941, the last sighting of enemy aircraft by the G.50 occurred, during which the targets, identified as fighters, eluded them yet again.\n\nOn 27 December 1940, the first 27 G.50s, belonging to 150ª and 152ª \"Squadriglia\", 2° \"Gruppo Autonomo C.T.\", arrived in Libya, where they operated out of Brindisi and Grottaglie airfields. On 9 January 1941, these fighters performed their first combat mission in the theatre when \"Capitano Pilota\" (Flight Lieutenant) Tullio De Prato, commander of 150ª \"Squadriglia\", was attacked by a Hawker Hurricane Mk I on the front line, forcing him to crash-land in the desert. On 31 January 1941, a new G.50-equipped unit, 155° \"Gruppo Autonomo C.T.\", consisting of 351ª, 360ª and 378ª Squadrons, commanded by \"Maggiore\" Luigi Bianchi, arrived in Libya. Caught up in the chaotic retreat of the Italian Army during the winter of 1940–41, however, the G.50s saw relatively little actual action.\n\nOne of the few initial claims of enemy aircraft being downed by \"Freccia\" pilots occurred on 9 April 1941, when \"Tenente Pilota\" Carlo Cugnasca (an expert pilot, and the first to deliver a G.50 to Finland), attacked a flight of three British Hurricane Mk Is from No. 73 Squadron and claimed to have downed one, although this loss was not confirmed. On his return, he was forced to crash-land his G.50, flipping the aircraft over on the airstrip but remaining unharmed.\n\nAt low level, the aerial clashes were often confused and had unpredictable effects. Tactical surprise was often a decisive factor in a given engagement, as shown on 14 April when a formation of 66 Axis aircraft, including eight G.50s, attacked British forces stationed in the vicinity of Tobruk. The RAF defenders of No. 73 Squadron were outnumbered in this engagement, resulting in the Hurricanes, which were only marginally faster than the G.50, having to ignore the Axis fighters and concentrate their efforts upon attacking incoming bombers, which posed the greatest threat. Flying their G.50s, both Cugnasca and Marinelli attacked H.G. Webster's Hurricane while he was shooting at a Stuka dive bomber, resulting in Webster being finally shot down and killed over Tobruk. A Canadian pilot, ace 'Smudgeon' Smith, saw the engagement and subsequently shot down and killed both Cugnasca and Marinelli as well as damaging another G.50 before being shot down himself by the G.50's squadron commander.\n\nOn 27 May, 20° \"Gruppo\" was reinforced by 151ª \"Squadriglia\", which was equipped with the new Fiat G.50 bis. This new version had almost two hours of flight endurance, due to the addition of an extra fuel tank in the internal fuselage section (which had been originally configured as a bomb bay). The normal tactic with the G.50 was to dive from , but they never flew very high over North Africa, usually not exceeding . The aircraft still lacked radio sets and, despite their air filters, the desert sand could reduce the engine's lifespan to only 70–80 hours.\n\nAlthough the G.50s were mainly outperformed by Desert Air Force fighters, their pilots sometimes managed to shoot down the faster and better-armed Hurricanes and P-40s. In the hands of expert pilots, the G.50 was even capable of scoring multiple kills during a single sortie. For instance, on the evening of 9 July 1941, \"Sergente Maggiore\" Aldo Buvoli of 378ª \"Squadriglia\", 155° \"Gruppo Autonomo\", took off from Castel Benito airfield to patrol Tripoli harbour and intercepted a flight of seven Blenheim light bombers, which had been engaged in a low-level attack on the ships. Two Fiat CR.42 biplanes from 151° \"Gruppo\" were already pursuing the Blenheims when Buvoli attacked, shooting at each bomber in sequence. One Blenheim ditched in the sea while another was shot down a few miles north of Tripoli. Two more failed to return to Luqa airfield in Malta and were posted as missing. For these successes, Buvoli was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor and subsequently credited with four kills. No. 110 Squadron reported the loss of a similar number of Blenheim IVs on its first mission since arriving in Malta from the British mainland during early July.\n\nDuring the Battle of Sidi Barrani, the first major British offensive of the Western Desert Campaign, a number of G.50s operating out of Martuba Airbase, Derna District, attacked the British-held airfield at Sidi Barrani. On 18 November 1941, during Operation \"Crusader\", the Desert Air Force was responsible for destroying 13 aircraft on the Ain el Gazala airfields, 10 of these being G.50s. On 19 November 20° \"Gruppo\", based at Sid el Rezegh, suffered heavy losses when British armoured forces suddenly attacked the airfield. Of the 19 G.50s, only three escaped, with 80 pilots and ground crew taken prisoner. Altogether, 26 G.50s were lost and \"20 Gruppo\" was left with only 36 G.50s, of which 27 were serviceable. Mario Bonzano, now a \"Tenente Colonnello\" and commander of 20° \"Gruppo\", was among the captured, and his deputy, Furio Niclot Doglio, was almost shot down, since he was unaware of the British operation. Several G.50s were captured almost intact, and at least one was taken by No. 260 Squadron and later passed to No. 272 Squadron.\n\nAfter 1941, the G.50 played only a minor role in the \"Regia Aeronautica\". During June 1942, British intelligence estimated that \"12 Gruppo\" had a total of 26 G.50s (10 of these being of a serviceable condition), while the backbone of 5a \"Squadra Aerea\" was estimated to have comprised a mixture of 104 C.202s, 63 C.200s, 32 Z.1007 and 31 S.79s.\n\nAfter Italy declared war on Greece in October 1940, the \"Freccia\" commenced offensive operations against Greek and Allied forces over the Balkans and the Aegean Sea on 28 October, typically operating from airfields at Berat, Devoli and Grottaglie.\n\nDuring the Greek campaign, adverse weather conditions was often responsible for hampering Axis air operations, however, a number of fiercely-fought aerial engagements were fought on several days, often accompanied by a large amount of overclaiming by personnel on both sides of the conflict. Early on 20 February 1941, a flight of Hawker Hurricane fighters were engaged in their first aerial combat over the Balkans when seven G.50s of \"54 Gruppo\" were scrambled from Devoli to intercept a formation of RAF bombers with their Hurricane escorts. A few days earlier, a British cargo ship had delivered six Hurricanes and several Wellington bombers to Paramythia, Greece, boosting RAF power in the region. \"Freccias\" claimed to have downed both bomber and a fighter, while the British claimed responsibility for downing four G.50s. That afternoon, 15 G.50s engaged a large mixed formation of RAF Gloster Gladiators, claiming the downing of 10 aircraft for the loss of one G.50. The RAF claimed three G.50s with no loss. Postwar records showed one Bristol Blenheim and a single G.50 being lost on that day.\nOn 28 February 1941, RAF units intercepted a formation of Italian bombers and their escorts, claiming 27 aircraft shot down and several others damaged in the ensuing battle. The Italians claimed to have downed six Gladiators and a single Supermarine Spitfire. The recorded losses were one Gladiator and eight Italian aircraft; many more were damaged. After this battle, the \"Regia Aeronautica\" was no longer an effective force within the theatre.\n\nOn 4 March 1941, a single G.50 bis was responsible for the shooting down of Hurricane \"V7288\", piloted by Australian RAF ace Flight Lieutenant Nigel Cullen (who was credited with 15 or 16 victories) off Valona coast (Albania), while he was flying as wing-man for ace Pat Pattle. During the course of the Greek campaign, a flight of 10 G.50 fighters were recorded as having been lost, including both combat losses and others that had been destroyed by a combination of accidents and as a consequence of Allied bombing missions against Italian airfields.\n\nDuring the second half of the war, the G.50 was typically operated as a multi-role fighter and ground attack aircraft, equipped only with external bombs. During the opening phase of the Allied invasion of Sicily, the G.50 was the most numerous aircraft used by the \"Regia Aeronautica\" to counterattack the Allied landings.\n\nJust prior to the start of the invasion, the a specialised ground attack unit of the \"Regia Aeronautica\", 50° \"Stormo Assalto\", was repositioned to Southern Italy; this unit was equipped with G.50 bis fighter-bombers. As soon the invasion started, on 10 July 1943, additional units were rushed to the area to participate in the Axis counter-attack. Alongside various other Italian and German ground attack units, 45 G.50 bis of 158 and 159 \"Gruppi Assalto\" from Pistoia were committed to attack Allied naval assets, landing craft and troops. Ten of these saw action on 11 July in conjunction with several Re.2002s and escorted by five Re.2005s of 362a Squadron, when they were intercepted by an overwhelming fighter \"umbrella\". In the ensuing engagement, three G.50s were shot down, including \"Tenente Colonnello\" (Wing Commander) Guido Nobili, commander of 5 \"Stormo Assalto\". The remainder of the Italian air forces returned to their base where, after landing, the fighters were mostly destroyed on the ground by a follow-up air attack.\n\nBy the time of the Italian Armistice with the Allies, only a handful of G.50 fighters were left in service in Italy. A number of these continued to be operated as part of the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, while at least four G.50s were used by the \"Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\" as fighter trainers. The top-scoring Italian pilot to use the G.50 was Furio Lauri, who was credited with 11 \"kills\" prior to the end of 1941, eventually achieving a final score of 18 enemy aircraft downed.\n\nThe G.50 saw its longest and most successful service in the two Finnish wars against the Soviet Union, the Winter War of 1939–1940 and the Continuation War of 1941–1944. At the end of 1939, before the outbreak of hostilities, Finland ordered 35 Fiat G.50s. The first 10 aircraft were to be delivered before February 1940. A group of Finnish pilots attended a 10-hour training course at Guidonia airport and later at Fiat Aviazione in Turin. On a training flight, during a dive from , Lieutenant Tapani Harmaja reached an estimated speed of , which was considered excessive for the structural integrity of the aircraft. The windscreen was damaged.\n\nGermany hindered the transit of the aircraft, so they were dismantled and embarked in La Spezia on the Norwegian ship \"Braga\", which set sail for Turku, Finland, on 20 January. Because of this delay, the first G.50s did not reach No. 26 Squadron, Finnish Air Force (\"HLeLv 26\") at Utti until February 1940.\nThe G.50s were numbered from FA-1 to FA-35, but it seems that only 33 were delivered.\nSquadron No 26 received from material command G.50 fighters according to the table below. A day before the truce after the Winter War, they had received 30 Fiat G.50s of the 35 purchased and 33 not damaged during the procurement.\n\nFiat G.50 FA-8 was destroyed during take-off when the pilot, a Hungarian volunteer, second lieutenant Wilhelm Bekasy, in bad flying weather, lost contact with his countryman, lieutenant Matias Pirity, who turned back. The next day sergeant Asser Wallenius took-off with FA-7, having forgotten to switch on the fuel pump of the main tank and as the extra fuel tanks emptied, FA-7 crashed and was damaged. Wallenius survived but he was injured. Because of technical problems in the Finnish airforce itself, only 33 of the 35 Fiat G.50s were delivered to Finland.\n\nThe Italian fighters had arrived too late to affect the course of that year's winter battles, however, most of them were soon sent to the front. The Fiat pilots found themselves involved in the heavy fighting over the bay of Vyborg in late February and early March. According to some sources, the first kill was achieved on 26 February. The following day, Second Lieutenant Malmivuo became the first Finnish pilot to be killed in a G.50, when his fighter FA-12 crashed after a battle with Soviet aircraft. And on 11 March, the Italian volunteer \"Sergente\" Dario Manzocchi crashed to his death while returning from a combat sortie. The Fiat bases were under constant attack. The Utti airfield was bombed by the Soviet airforce. Consequently, the Fiats were transferred two kilometres to the northwest of Utti proper, onto the ice at Haukkajärvi (\"Falcon lake\"). As Haukkajärvi became bombed and attacked by fighters, another lake-side base was established near the city of Lahti, Hollola, also on the ice of Vesijärvi near Pyhäniemi manor.\nOverall, \"HLeLv 26\" achieved 11 kills, against one loss in combat and another in an accident.\n\nThe Finnish G.50 y were taken from the 235 built by CMASA, both \"Serie I\" and \"Serie II\", but all but seven had the open cockpit of the \"Serie II\", a feature that Finnish pilots disliked, especially in winter. There were some attempts to improve the aircraft – one was tested with an enclosed cockpit, another with a D.XXI ski-undercarriage – but none of the modifications were put into service. Better protection for the propeller, which had problems at extremely low temperatures, and a few other changes were introduced. The speed of the Finnish G.50s was around , much lower than the standard series could achieve.\nAt this stage, Finnish pilots preferred the Hawker Hurricane, the French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and the Brewster F2A Buffalo to the G.50.\n\n\"Source: Fiat.laivue – Lentolaivue 26 sodassa (The Fiat Squadron – the Squadron n:o 26 in war), pages 152 and 153. appendix Koneluettelo (Aircraft list), Kari Stenman, Maininkitie 14 A, FI-02320 ESPOO, +358 9 8092187, http://www.kolumbus.fi/kari.stenman, printed Otavan Kirjapaino Oy, Helsinki, 2013, \"\n\nThe first demonstration of the Finnish Air Force's effectiveness came on 25 June 1941, when the G.50s from \"HLeLv 26\" shot down 13 out of 15 Soviet SB bombers. Thirteen aerial victories were achieved altogether.\n\nDuring the Continuation War, the G.50s were most successful during the Finnish offensive of 1941, after which they became ever less impressive. In 1941, \"HLeLv 26\" claimed 52 victories for the loss of only two fighters. The Soviets brought better, newer types of fighter to the front line in 1942 and 1943, while the Fiats were becoming old and run-down and the lack of spare parts meant that pilots were restricted to a minimal number of sorties. Nevertheless, between 30 November 1939 and 4 September 1944, the G.50s of \"HLeLv 26\" shot down 99 enemy aircraft, including aircraft more modern than they, such as the British fighters sent to the USSR. In the same period, Finnish squadrons lost 41 aircraft of several types. But Fiat lost in combat were just three, with a ratio victory/loss of 33/1.\n\nThe most successful Finnish G.50 pilots were Oiva Tuominen (23 victories), Olli Puhakka (11 or 13), according to other sources, Nils Trontti (6), Onni Paronen (4), Unto Nieminen (4) and Lasse Lautamäki (4). The Finnish G.50s were finally phased out of front-line duty in the summer of 1944. They were no more than 10 or 12, and even as trainers, they did not last long, since they lacked spare parts. Unlike the older MS.406, there was no effort to change their engine to make them better and faster. The last G.50 was struck off the inventory on 13 December 1946, at the FAF flight academy in Kauhava.\n\nIn October 1941, the Croatian Air Force Legion requested military aid from Italy, that country agreed to deliver 10 Fiat G.50s (nine single-seaters and one two-seater), along with ancillary equipment. On 12 June 1942, the Fiat G.50 bis fighters took off from Fiat Aviazione in Turin for Croatia, but before they reached the border, they were stopped on the orders of Ugo Cavallero, Chief of the Italian Supreme Command, who feared that the Croatian pilots would defect. The G.50s had to wait until 25 June before being delivered to the Croatian Air Force, which assigned them to the 16th \"Jato\" at Banja Luka and were intensively used until 1945 against Yugoslav Partisans, at first in Bosnia and Herzegovina, then in Serbia, Croatia and Dalmatia. During 1942, a Croatian G.50 bis squadron was transferred from Northern Yugoslavia to the Ukrainian front, flanking the 4th \"Luftflotte\".\n\nOn 25 June 1943, the \"Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Drzave Hrvatske\" (Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia, or ZNDH), received nine G.50 bis fighters and one G.50B. In October, while based at Zalužani airfield, Banja Luka, they flew many strafing missions against partisans for nearly a year.\n\nAfter the Italian armistice of 8 September 1943, the Luftwaffe supplied the Croatian Air Force Legion with 20–25 Fiat G.50s captured on \"Regia Aeronautica\" airfields in the Balkans. These equipped two Croatian fighter units, but by the end of 1943 only 10 aircraft remained. Three G.50s captured after the Armistice were loaned to \"Kro JGr 1\" at the beginning of 1944. In 1944 some of the G.50s were operated at the Brezice training school. ZNDH entered 1945 with seven G.50s (two operational). On 10 March 1945 six of these Fiats were based in Lucko, operated by 2.\"LJ\" (\"Lovacka Grupa\", Fighter Group). Three were damaged by RAF Mustangs of Nos 213 and 249 Squadrons attacking Lucko airfield with napalm bombs, on 25 March, and the following day one of the last operative \"Freccia\" was flown to a RAF-held airfield by \"vod\" (Corporal) Ivan Misulin that defected, together with \"vod\" Korhut (flying a Bf 109 G-10). The last G.50s were captured by Yugoslav Partisans. After the war, the G.50s were used for some time by the newly formed Yugoslav Air Force – the last G.50s on active service.\n\n\n\nIn September 2010, the only known G.50 bis still in existence was undergoing restoration in the Museum of Aviation, in Surčin, at Nikola Tesla Airport, Serbia.\n\n"}

At the time of the film's release, Jahan's role was controversial for several reasons. Beals was an unknown actress when \"Flashdance\" premiered, and throughout the movie were close-ups of what was purported to be Beals' body. However Marine Jahan's contribution was not listed on the movie's opening or ending credits, and because the movie was a huge hit by the time the truth of Jahan's participation had become public knowledge, some felt deceived to learn they had been looking at Jahan's dancing (and bicycle riding), not Beals'. The producers of the film stated they had made no secret of having used a stunt double, and Jahan's name did not appear because Paramount Pictures shortened the closing credits.\n\nJahan's other major film appearance was as a dancer in \"Torchie's\" bar in the 1984 movie \"Streets of Fire\".

{"id": "1838496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838496", "title": "Lina Inverse", "text": "Lina Inverse\n\nLina was one of the most popular anime characters of the late 1990s and has since retained a sizable fan following. There have been also characters based on or inspired by her in both \"Slayers\" and in other works.\n\n\"Slayers\" creator Hajime Kanzaka has originally created the characters of Lina and Luna (Lina's unseen sister in \"Slayers\") as the heroines of his science-fiction story that he had written when he was in high school and in which Luna was the protagonist and Lina was her clone. While creating her visual design, \"Slayers\" illustrator and visual designer Rui Araizumi was inspired when he by chance came upon a vintage film with the actress Audrey Hepburn on TV.\n\nLina has a petite body type and is 147 cm (4 feet 10 inches) tall. She has two moles on her forehead, which are usually covered by her headband. Despite her supposed to be having a very flat chest, so much she can be confused for a boy, Lina is often depicted by Araizumi with larger breasts due to his personal preferences, which would be then carried over to much of other media too. Lina's appearance whilst wearing her homeland's folk clothing in the film \"\" is a nod to Ranma Saotome, the titular character from \"Ranma 1/2\", who too (like Lina) is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara in Japanese.\n\nLina Inverse was born in the fictional country of Zephilia. Since her mother used to be a mercenary magic user, Lina, suffering from inferiority complex to her sister, decided she would like to be a sorceress and coaxed her parents to send her to the Sorcerer's Guild school. Her older sister, the Knight of Shiphied Luna Inverse, was the darling of both her parents and the town, excelling in martial studies and quickly beginning to make a name for herself. Although Lina has faced down dragons, monsters, and even dark lords with little fear, the mere mention of Luna's name sends her into terrified hysterics. When Lina was a child, she sold images of Luna naked in order to earn money and, in turn, Luna punished Lina so severely that Lina has feared her ever since.\n\nLina has many different nicknames, including \"Bandit Killer\" and \"Dragon Spooker\", neither of which she likes. To her, her most embarrassing nickname is \"Lina the Pink\", which is her official title amongst the Guild. In the light novel, manga, film and OVA prequel stories, Lina meets an unhinged and secretive sorceress calling herself Naga the Serpent and maniacally obsessed with Lina, with whom she then travels with and often ends up fighting against during their adventures. During that time, Lina earns her reputation of someone who tracks and destroys numerous bandits for fun and profit, stealing their ill-gotten gains for their own use. In \"Slayers Revolution\", Lina embarks on pirate hunting after bandits have become an \"endangered species\". According to Kanzaka, Lina and her self-proclaimed rival Naga are the mightiest human magic users in the world of \"Slayers\"; while Naga has a larger potential magical capacity, Lina knows the ultimate black magic spells, notably the devastating Dragon Slave, which is her famed signature attack.\n\nAlthough she is an adolescent (between 15 and 16 years old in most stories), she is an extremely powerful sorceress, with a great love for money, treasure (especially the magical sort) and food. In the anime and manga (but not the light novels), Lina recklessly uses overly destructive magic, often with little provocation (though depicted lightheartedly). As such, she is widely reputed to be an evil and calamitous \"Enemy of All Who Live\", among many other similar monikers (such as \"Empress of Destruction\", \"Natural Disaster Mage\", \"Raven-Black Witch\" and \"No-Breasts Demon\"). In spite of her infamy and an underdeveloped body, Lina likes to see herself as a genial, dignified, and beautiful sorceress. As analyzed by the NTUT's John Lance Griffith, \"to the extent that Lina is an independent, powerful woman ('a girl today' in contrast to the traditional Japanese woman), she follows in the tradition of Western lady knights and sorceresses: the tradition of Spenser's Britomart, of Tolkien's Arwen and Eowyn. But given the world she lives in (and to the extent that it reflects the world we live in) perhaps we are meant to understand that she can only be so noble and so charitable before she has to re-enter the war of all against all.\"\n\nAdding to her mental instability, she is also selfish, short-tempered and gluttonous, and suffers an inferiority complex over her chest size, especially when alongside the very busty Naga who likes to taunt Lina over this. Lina's accomplishments include the destruction of a piece of Shabranigdo and having a hand in the destruction of the demon lords including the dragon demon lords Gaav and Hellmaster Phibrizzo, as well as defeating the great cosmic evil Dark Star. Due to these accomplishments, she is increasingly piquing the interest of the Mazoku demon kind and has become a frequent target.\n\nAt the beginning of the main series, Lina meets a swordsman named Gourry Gabriev and a chimera boy named Zelgadis Greywords. Lina encounters and destroys a part of the Mazoku Lord Shabranigdo with her ultimate Giga Slave spell, which draws power from the Lord of Nightmares, the highest deity of the \"Slayers\" universe, but has no plans to ever use it again after almost ending the world. She befriends a princess named Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun and the priestess Sylphiel Nels Lahda. She later meets a mysterious priest Xellos and gets caught between Chaos Dragon Gaav and Hellmaster Phibrizzo. In the anime-exclusive series \"Slayers Try\", Lina is recruited by the dragoness Filia Ul Copt to save the world. In \"Slayers Revolution\", Lina gets arrested on false pretense which later comes leading her on a journey against another incarnation of the Demon Beast Zannafar. She also meets an odd little creature named Pokota, who too has the ability to use the Dragon Slave.\n\nLina and Gourry have traveled with each other ever since they met, and they have been featured in every form of \"Slayers\" media that takes place in the timeline after they meet. Lina appears to fall in love with Gourry, once even risking the destruction of the universe in order to save him. There is a distinct lack of romantic development in the series, even after it is affirmed that Lina and Gourry love each other. Kanzaka addressed this by jokingly stating that he is not adept in writing romantic scenes. The final climax of \"Slayers Next\", the second season of the \"Slayers\" TV series, the two characters share a kiss, though they cannot later recall the incident. However, both Gourry and Lina remember that something important had happened between them. In any media taking place after the two met, they have been featured together and should they ever get separated, are never apart for too long.\n\nLina is also the main protagonists through the entire official series of the uncanonical \"Slayers\" role-playing video games from the 1990s, and further appears as a player character or an avatar option in the role-playing video game \"Heroes Phantasia\", with Naga in the action video game \"Magical Battle Arena\" and in the role-playing video game \"\", with Gourry in the role-playing video game \"La Tale\" and again in \"Valkyrie Anatomia\", with both Naga and Gourry in the role-playing video game \"Granblue Fantasy\", and with them as well other main characterd in \"LINE Rangers\" and \"Puzzle & Dragons\". The audio drama \"Slayers Kita Kaette EX #4\", which provides a pseudo-closure to the entire \"Slayers\" saga (since it was made before \"Slayers Evolution-R\"), features the retired Lina and Naga, both now elderly in their eighties (with almost all other characters already deceased) and vacationing together while still quarreling and fighting each other.\n\nIn the science fiction themed \"Lost Universe\", Kanzaka's another media franchise, the traits and personas of Lina and Gourry were mixed together to create its male protagonist, Kain Blueriver. Several different versions of Lina populate the \"Slayers\" world itself, due to various plots.\n\nIn one story from the prequels, Lina and Naga are exposed to a mirror that creates an exact opposite of whoever looks in it. The wizard using it expects this to produce dark and violent version of the two that would side with him and destroy the originals, but the mirror copies turn out sweet, kind, generous, and extremely concerned about the feelings of each other and everyone around them. In their attempts to break the spell, Lina and Naga actually wind up creating dozens of such doppelgängers of themselves, which go on to found an entire village full of philanthropic Linas and Nagas. A slightly adapted version of this story, which resulted in the mirror being destroyed without creating more than the initial copies, served as the bassist of the \"Slayers Special\" OAV episode \"Mirror Mirror\".\n\nIn the \"Slayers\" TV series, Gourry and Lina are both the subject of an attempt at cloning, which spawns a number of miniature, super deformed versions of them both; the tiny clones fight to humorous effect, and after the mini Linas win, they all disintegrate. Even more, in this case mostly lifelike, clones of Lina were created by Xellos' master Zellas Metallium in the video game \"Slayers\" in which one of them, who believes herself to be the real Lina, is a playable character and the game's initial protagonist.\n\nIn the film \"Slayers Great\", a super deformed, giant, toylike fighting golem named \"Piko-Piko Lina-chan\" is constructed in a distorted image of Lina's that emphasises her kawaii (cute) attributes, much to Lina's dismay and anger as she believed she had been chosen to model for its creation because of her (self-imagined) great beauty. It is also featured in the video game \"Slayers Royal 2\".\n\nLina Inverse has become a popular and critically praised character both in Japan and overseas; writing in 1999, Dave Halverson called \"Slayers\"' Lina and Naga \"two of anime [medium]'s brightest stars in both Japan and the U.S.\" Lina won \"Animage\" magazine's Anime Grand Prix 1998 award for the best female character of 1997, also placing second in 1997 (after Rei Ayanami, also voiced by Hayashibara), fourth in 1996, and eight in 1999. In 2000, she won the Best of \"Dragon Magazine\" popular vote in two categories, including at first place in best female hero. In 2004, readers of the Japanese magazine \"Animedia\" voted her the seventh most popular female character in the Animedia 23rd Anniversary Anime Awards. Retrospectively, Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" declared her the 15th top anime heroine of the 1990s.\n\nLina has been also included in many top lists by various websites. For example, The Mary Sue's Citlin Donovan included her among \"Six Leading Ladies of Shonen Anime\" and the SBS PopAsia's Jamaica dela Cruz named her as number one \"baddest anime female\". Anime News Network's Lynzee Loveridge put \"Lina Inverse and Company\" at second spot in \"Traditional Fantasy Parties\", while Gia Manry from the same website ranked her first among all anime's \"Easiest Good Guys to Make Angry\", as well as placing Lina second on her lists of \"Destroyers of the Fourth Wall\" and \"Most Destructive Heroes\". She has since remained one of Hayashibara's best known roles.\n\nThe character's popularity led to several cameo appearances in various other media, including the role-playing game \"Ironclaw\" (a fangame style homage on the First Edition cover, along with Naga), the video game \"Shadow Warrior\" (in an in-game poster), and in the first episode of the anime series \"Full Metal Panic!\" (shown on a cover of \"Dragon Magazine\"). The protagonists of the 2002 anime miniseries \"Cosplay Complex\", Chako and Reika, dress up as Naga and Lina in the third episode, and Lina and Naga also made a cameo appearance in French comic book series \"Les Légendaires Origines\" in 2014.\n\nA \"Slayers\"-inspired player character Lina is part of the \"Dota\" video game series: in the \"\" mod \"Defense of the Ancients\", she shares the name of \"Lina Inverse\", while simply going by \"Lina\" in \"Dota 2\" and is referred to as \"Lina the Slayer\" in the games lore; in both games, she is a redhead whose spells' names reference these in \"Slayers\": \"Dragon Slave\", \"Light Strike Array\" (Explosion Array), and \"Laguna Blade\" (Ragna Blade). Lina and her \"Dragon Slave\" are also parodied in the 2012 anime series \"Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions\" (in the episode \"Regret of... the Scriptures of Darkness (Mabinogion)\") and in the 2015 American animated series \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\" (in the episode \"The Battle for Mewni\"). \n\n"}

{"id": "1838510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838510", "title": "Rawalpindi conspiracy", "text": "Rawalpindi conspiracy\n\nThe Rawalpindi Conspiracy (also known as the Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case) was an attempted \"coup d'état\" against the governments of Liaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime Minister of Pakistan, in 1951. The conspiracy was the first of many subsequent coup attempts against elected governments in the history of Pakistan. The coup was planned by Major-General Akbar Khan, a senior commander in the Pakistani army, in conjunction with 15 other military officers and left-wing Pakistani politicians.\n\nMain causes of Rawaplindi conspiracy case (busted on 9 March 1951) were three. One, a general discontent of Army's Pakistani Officers with the performance of the Liaqat Ali Khan's Government, whom they thought of as corrupt and incompetent. Two, many of the high ranking Pakistani Generals viewed the continuing presence of British Army Officers in the army as a security threat, as well as an impediment to their speedy promotions. Third, and most immediate cause was their discontent with Liaqat regime's handling of the Kashmir war with India (1948). Army officers thought Government's acceptance of UN mediation and ceasefire, as a 'tame surrender' and 'flouting an opportunity to capture whole of Kashmir'. Several Pakistan Army officers who had fought the Kashmir war, were ethnic Kashmiris and owned land in the contested province. Maj. General Akbar Khan (who was the master mind behind the Rawalpindi Conspiracy) had communist leanings, which explains why he enlisted the support of communist/leftists intellectuals of Pakistan. e.g. Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Syed Sajjad Zaheer (Secretary General of Pakistan Communist Party). Whether USSR was actively involved in this conspiracy is not supported by any evidence. This conspiracy had no connection with Pakistan's joining SEATO or CENTO, as both these international bodies came into being much later (in 1954 and 1955, respectively).\n\nEleven military officers and four civilians were involved in the conspiracy. The main person responsible for planning the coup was Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan, the chief of general staff of the Pakistani army. During the 1947 war, Khan had led Pakistani forces under the pseudonym of \"General Tariq.\" He was based in the northern city of Rawalpindi, where the army headquarters were located, while the political capital of the state was in the southern city of Karachi at the time. The civilian conspirators included leading Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, who was notably active in left-wing politics and sympathetic to the Communist Party of Pakistan, and Sajjad Zaheer. Akbar Khan's wife, Naseem Shahnawaz Khan, was also believed to have motivated her husband to undertake this plot.\n\nThe conspiracy was foiled after the government was informed of the coup attempt by one of the confidantes of Akbar Khan. Government forces immediately arrested Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan and the other conspirators, including Faiz Ahmed Faiz. The army commander-in-chief, Gen. Muhammad Ayub Khan and the defence secretary Maj. Gen. Iskander Mirza had both remained loyal to the government. Ayub Khan immediately ordered the army troops to surround and take control of the army headquarters, where Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan was based. Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan announced the foiling of the coup on 9 March 1951. The government passed the Rawalpindi Conspiracy (Special Tribunal) Act to set up a special tribunal to investigate the conspiracy. A trial was held for the 15 individuals accused, namely – Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan, Air Commodore M. K. Janjua, Maj. Gen. Nazir Ahmed, Brigadier Sadiq Khan, Brigadier M. A. Latif Khan, Lt. Col. Zia-ud-Din, Lt. Col. Niaz Muhammad Arbab, Captain Khizar Hayat, Maj. Hassan Khan, Major Ishaq Muhammad, Captain Zafrullah Poshni, Mrs. Naseem Akbar Khan, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Syed Sajjad Zaheer and Muhammad Hussain Ata.\n\nAfter an 18-month trial conducted in secrecy, Maj. Gen. Khan and Faiz Ahmed Faiz were both convicted and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Their defence lawyer was the notable Bengali Muslim politician Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. When Suhrawardy became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1957, he obtained a reprieve for most of the conspirators.\n\nMajor General Akbar Khan was soon rehabilitated in Pakistani political life, becoming an adviser to Pakistani politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Upon coming to power in 1971, Bhutto appointed Akbar Khan as the chief of national security. Faiz continued to publish many works of poetry, and was appointed to the National Council for Arts by the Bhutto government. Gen. Ayub Khan launched the first successful military coup against the government of President Iskander Mirza in 1958, assuming the reins of the presidency himself until 1969. Liaquat Ali Khan was assassinated later in 1951, in October, in an unrelated attack by an Afghan in Rawalpindi.\n\n"}

It was first introduced at the NAMM Show on March 21, 2003. Ernie Ball president Sterling Ball designed the instrument in conjunction with the Music Man Research and Development department and BMW's Designworks team. It is equipped with an 18-volt 4-band preamp (except on the single-pickup model, which has a 3-band preamp; single-pickup models with piezo bridges have a 4-band preamp) designed by Dudley Gimpel with help from Cliff Hugo and other Music Man artists. It also sports a sleek, carved basswood body with high-gloss polyester finish and a satin-finish painted 34\" scale maple neck with rosewood fingerboard (pau ferro on lined or unlined fretless, ebony on both fretted and fretless \"stealth\" basses) featuring 24 high-profile wide frets and crescent moon-shaped position inlays. These basses are generally known for their dual humbucking pickup configuration, as they are the first twin humbucker-equipped models released by Music Man since the introduction of their Sabre and Cutlass bass guitars in the late 1970s.\n\nThe Bongo is available with four, five, and since 2008, six strings, fretted and fretless lined or unlined, with neodymium H (single humbucker), HS (bridge humbucker/neck single-coil) and HH (dual humbuckers) pickup configurations. A bridge with piezoelectric pickups is available on all models except left-handed and six-string versions. On all multiple-pickup models there is a blend control rather than the selection switch found on other Music Man basses (piezo models have an additional blend control for the piezo bridge).\n\nThe pickup placement on the H model is in the \"sweet spot\" that is characteristic of Music Man basses. The placement on the multiple-pickup models, however, differs from all of the company's other basses. Both the bridge and neck pickups are set closer to the bridge, probably in part because of space constraints due to the Bongo's 24-fret neck.\n\nThe combination of a relatively lightweight, resonant basswood body, neodymium pickups and 18-volt preamp give the Bongo a distinctive tonal character that is markedly different from other Music Man basses, which have none of these features.\n\nNotable users include Dave LaRue, Cliff Hugo, Tony Levin, John Myung, Colin Edwin, Jari Kainulainen, Philip Bynoe, Greg Christian, Phil Chen, John Pierce, Will Turpin, Jason James, Marcin Novak, Gail Ann Dorsey and Squarepusher.\n\n"}

{"id": "1838526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838526", "title": "Dreamlover (song)", "text": "Dreamlover (song)\n\n\"Dreamlover\" is a song by American singer Mariah Carey, released on July 27, 1993, as the lead single from her third studio album, \"Music Box\" (1993). The lyrics were written by Carey, with music composed by Carey and Dave Hall, and was produced by Carey, Walter Afanasieff and Hall. The song incorporates a sample of the hook from \"Blind Alley\" by the Emotions, previously used in \"Ain't No Half-Steppin'\" (1988) by Big Daddy Kane, into its melody and instrumentation. \"Dreamlover\" marked a more pronounced attempt on Carey's part to incorporate pop into her music, as was seen in her decision to work with Hall, who had previously produced \"What's the 411?\" `(1992) by Mary J Blige. This was partly in light of the mixed reception to her previous studio effort \"Emotions\" (1991), which featured gospel and 1960s soul influences. Lyrically, the song pictures a protagonist calling for a perfect lover, her \"dreamlover,\" to whisk her away into the night and not disillusion her like others in the past.\n\n\"Dreamlover\" received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics, many of whom praised the song's incorporated sample, as well as Carey's carefree vocal style. The song was the first of several of her lead singles that sampled older tunes as a musical bed, as seen in \"Fantasy\" (1995), \"Honey\" (1997), \"Heartbreaker\" (1999), and \"Loverboy\" (2001). It experienced strong worldwide success, becoming Carey's seventh chart topper on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, remaining there for eight weeks. It peaked at number one in Canada and became a top-ten single in Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nCarey performed \"Dreamlover\" live on several televised talk shows around the world, including \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" in September 1993, the British music chart program \"Top of the Pops\", and the 1993 \"Music Fair\" in Japan. In 1999, following the release of Carey's \"Rainbow\", the song was included in the \"Mariah Carey Homecoming Special\", and her appearance on \"The Today Show\". Additionally, \"Dreamlover\" was featured in the set-lists of most of her succeeding tours, making its debut on the Music Box Tour (1993). The song was included on Carey's compilation albums, \"#1's\" (1998), \"Greatest Hits\" (2001), and \"#1 to Infinity\" (2015).\n\nThe song's music video was filmed by Diane Martel in Copake, in upstate New York, in June 1993. It includes an appearance by Carey's dog Jack, and shows Carey dancing in a flowerbed and field, swimming in a large pond, boarding a hot air balloon, and dancing alongside several shirtless male dancers. According to author Chris Nickson, the video's carefree setting harmonized well with the song's soft instrumentation. Due to the song's strong radio airplay and extended charting, the video received frequent play on several music video channels throughout the summer of 1993.\n\nCarey's debut studio album made a strong impact on pop music, but the singer became interested in altering her sound and branching out into other genres for her second studio effort, \"Emotions\" (1991). Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical direction, enabling her to change the musical genre, melodies, and production style. Carey worked with many new musicians and producers on the album; Walter Afanasieff was the only holdover from her debut. \"Emotions\" contained influences from gospel, R&B and soul music as well as from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry. While the album was praised by some as being more mature and raw, it failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, selling fewer units and failing to introduce Carey into new markets. Columbia decided to return Carey to the same genre as her debut album and have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly record. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals and soften the album's production to create a contemporary pop record. Carey and Afanasieff agreed to the change and began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, \"Music Box\" (1993).\n\nWhile recording \"Music Box\", Carey began to alter her songwriting style and genre choices, most notably in \"Dreamlover\". The song is different from anything she had recorded on her previous album, as it leans on R&B and light hip-hop influences. While searching for new record producers for the album, Carey came across Dave Hall, a New York native who was known from his work on Mary J. Blige's debut album, \"What's the 411?\" (1992). Carey wanted to incorporate a sampled loop from an older song into \"Dreamlover\", her second song to do so. The pair reviewed several older tunes and melodies, and chose \"Blind Alley\", performed by The Emotions in 1972. This song had previously been sampled in Big Daddy Kane's \"Ain't No Half-Steppin'\", which led Mariah to use the sample for Dreamlover.\n\n\"I wanted to do something that had a happy feeling, something that was more open and released, and that's really not Dave. It's very anti what he's about. So he said, 'Oh, you want to do that happy stuff? All right, all right.' He was not into doing it. Then we started listening to a lot of different and old loops and we used the 'Blind Alley' loop and I started singing the melody over it.\"\n\nAlthough Carey had heard the hook used in several other songs over the years, she felt her use of the sample was done in a more innovative way. \"We built the song from there and I wrote the lyrics and the melody and Dave ended up liking it,\" she continued. After having completed the song, Hall complimented Carey's work ethic and form of writing, calling her a \"perfectionist\" and \"very professional.\" He explained that they incorporated the hook, a melody, and the sample into the song over the course of one night. The song's title was not added until the end of production. Hall said Carey works in a unique fashion, usually developing the song's instrumentals and hook prior to the lyrics and title. Carey describes the songwriting process:\n\n\"The way I usually work is I do an untitled song. We'll grab the hook, whether sampled or created, and use it as the working title. I wrote the verses first, as well as the melody and the inclusion of several instrumentals. Sometimes I'll have an idea for a lyrics. If I'm collaborating with someone, I'll direct them in the direction that I'm going chord wise, because I get all these melody ideas and then I lose them if I don't have someone really good with the keyboard with me. That's why I tend to collaborate because I lose the ideas by the time I figure out the chord. All these melody ideas just go.\"\n\nWhen Carey's fiancé at the time, Tommy Mottola, came to hear the song in the studio, he had mixed feelings. He approached Walter Afanasieff and asked him to add some additional instrumentation and flavor. Afanasieff changed the song at the production level, altering the way in which the hook sample was incorporated into the song, as well as adding several new instruments. He described the changes to Bronson in an interview:\n\n\"Mariah and Dave did this loop thing which was new to us pop producers at the time. Their version of 'Dreamlover' was missing a lot of stuff. The spirit of the song was up but it wasn't hitting hard enough. I re-worked the drums, organ and keyboard. The organ and hi-hat part I changed made it a bit more swinging and a little bit more driving. I put a whole new shade of colors to it.\"\n\"Dreamlover\" is a mid-tempo pop and light R&B track. The song is written in the key of F major, and the beat is set in common time which moves at a moderate pace of 104 beats per minute. It has the sequence of F–Gm–F–Gm as its chord progression.\n\nThe song was written and produced by Carey and Hall, with additional work done by Afanasieff, who added a slightly altered instrumentation. \"Dreamlover\" samples the hook and a musical loop from \"Blind Alley\" by R&B group The Emotions. The sampling provides a \"backbone\" for the instrumentation and production, as well as being inter-looped in the bridge. Carey uses a whistle register to introduce the first verse.\n\nIn his review, Jozen Cummings from \"PopMatters\" described the song as \"pure, frothy pop.\" Cummings felt Afanasieff's usage of the Hammond B3 organ added \"an old school vibe\" to \"Dreamlover\", as it harmonizes with the \"extremely catchy musical hook.\" Cummings describes the theme of the lyrics:\n\n\"... the lyric is a description of, and a call for, the mythic Dreamlover; someone to take her away, to 'rescue' her. Fluffy-seeming stuff, to be sure (and possibly cringe-inducing for some folk), but very possibly also an expression of the simplest of romantic dreams: to find the 'right' person; someone who makes you feel taken care of, loved, safe.\"\nCummings called the second verse's first lines \"Don't want another pretender / To disillusion me one more time / Whispering words of forever / Playing with my mind\" an \"interesting mix of innocence and very grown-up cynicism and world-weariness.\" Wayne Robins from \"Newsday\" compared the vocals to \"Motown and Philly soul singing,\" while praising Afansieff's inclusion of the Hammond B-3 for the way the \"riffs provide a nice organic contrast to the synthesizers that dominate the record.\"\n\n\"Dreamlover\" earned widely positive reviews from music critics, many of whom praised its production, the sampling of the hook, and the vocals. In reference to the common criticism that Carey over-sings and over-uses her upper registers, Cummings wrote \"truth is, she is never crass in the use of her amazing instrument. On 'Dreamlover', especially, she keeps a close, tasteful rein on the acrobatics.\" Ron Wynn from Allmusic called the song personal and intense. He enjoyed Carey's more mature vocal style on the album, as well as the usage of the hook and the instrumentation. J. D. Considine from \"The Baltimore Sun\" called its melody \"breezy\" while \"The Buffalo News\" described it as \"a sassy, pop rocker with a dance beat\". David Browne from \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt Carey's soft singing and lack of volume was hurtful to the song, saying she \"lost herself.\" He thought the hook was catchy, but overly familiar. In 2018, the magazine noted the track’s \"glorious, frolicking-in-cutoffs groove.\" Roger Friedman from \"Fox News\" named \"Dreamlover\" and \"Vision of Love\" Carey's best, calling them \"the original hits.\" Jeff Silberman from \"The Network Forty\" described it as \"a delicious midtempo pop gem, bolstered by in-the-pocket instrumentation, Carey's pristine vocals and a velvet production sound\". Tom Moon from \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" called the song \"irresistibly bubbly\". \"The Plain Dealer\" noted that it \"starts out with one of those upper-register vocal runs that can make dogs howl and shatter glassware in neighboring states.\" Pop Rescue said that Carey’s vocals \"are confident, strong, and also perfectly partnered to this chilled out track\", adding it as a \"wonderful\" song. While reviewing \"Butterfly\" (1997), Rich Juzwiak of \"Slant Magazine\" praised the song's incorporation of the \"Blind Alley\" hook, saying it was done \"as sweetly as possible.\" \n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" listed the song as one of \"The 100 Greatest Moments in Rock Music: The 90s\"; it was their top pick for 1993. \"Dreamlover\" received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\n\n\"Dreamlover\" was Carey's seventh number one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, topping the chart in its sixth week and stayed there for eight consecutive weeks (September 5 to October 30, 1993)—her longest stay at the time. It replaced \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" by UB40, and was later replaced by Meat Loaf's \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That).\" It spent 26 weeks in the top 40 and was ranked number eight on the Hot 100 1993 Year-End Charts and 20 on the Decade-End Charts. The song was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 22, 1993, denoting shipments of over one million units throughout the United States. It sold 935,000 units domestically. \"Dreamlover\" holds the joint title of the highest debuting song on the \"Billboard\" Pop Songs chart, entering the chart at number 12 on the week dated August 14, 1993 but was tied by Taylor Swift's \"Shake It Off\" in 2014. In Canada, \"Dreamlover\" became Carey's fifth number one single on the Canadian \"RPM\" Singles Chart, debuting at number 60 on the chart during the week of August 14, 1993. Three weeks later, the song reached the chart's number one position; it spent six consecutive weeks at the top and a total of 21 weeks on the singles chart. On the \"RPM\" Year-End Charts, \"Dreamlover\" finished at number two.\n\n\"Dreamlover\" entered the Australian Singles Chart at number 41 during the week of August 23, 1993, eventually reaching a peak of number seven and spending a total of 21 consecutive weeks on the chart. The song was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of over 35,000 units throughout the country. In New Zealand, \"Dreamlover\" reached a peak position of number two on the New Zealand Singles Chart and spent sixteen weeks fluctuating on the chart. The Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) certified the song gold for shipments of 7,500 units in the country. On the Dutch Top 40, \"Dreamlover\" debuted at number 36 during the week of August 28, 1993. After attaining a peak of number nine, the song dropped off the top 40 after a chart run of 13 weeks. On the yearly charts, the song finished at number 69. In Switzerland the song peaked at number thirteen and spent sixteen weeks on the singles chart. On the UK Singles Chart, \"Dreamlover\" reached its peak position of number nine during the week of September 4, 1993. It spent a total of ten weeks on the chart, exiting on October 23, 1993. Sales in the United Kingdom are estimated at 150,000 units.\n\nThe music video for \"Dreamlover\" was directed by Diane Martel and filmed in upstate New York in June 1993. The video features scenes of Carey swimming in a small pond by a waterfall, boarding a colorful hot air balloon, and dancing alongside several shirtless male dancers. As the video begins, Carey is swimming underwater while wearing clothing. She is soon gasping for air and climbing into a flower bed above. As she frolics and rolls in a field, scenes of Carey boarding a hot air balloon are intercut. Her dog Jack makes an appearance, as he follows her through the field and pond. After a short interval of dancing alongside several male dancers, Carey leaves with her dog as the video concludes. After filming the video, Carey revealed that the water was so cold that she refused to swim until the director, Martel, dived in first. Author Chris Nickson felt the video captured the song's soft and relaxed nature: \"The casual feel, almost like clips from home movies edited together, captured the song's off-the-shoulder airiness.\" The video received heavy rotation on several music video channels, which added to the song's chart performance.\n\n\"Dreamlover\" marked the first time Carey was given creative control over remixing her songs. She enlisted David Morales to create the \"Def Club Mix\"; it was the first of Carey's remixes to use re-recorded vocals. An officially-released live version of \"Dreamlover\", derived from the television special \"Here Is Mariah Carey\" (1994), is available. \"Dreamlover\" B-side track (\"Do You Think of Me\") was written and produced by Carey, Afanasieff, Cory Rooney, and Mark Morales. Kelefa Sanneh from \"The New York Times\" complimented the remix, writing \"[It] is a revelation: after a long percussion break, he isolates a few of Ms. Carey's ad-libs; her ultrafalsetto vocals sound spookier than all of Basement Jaxx's sound effects combined.\"\n\nCarey performed \"Dreamlover\" on several telecasts in the United States and throughout Europe. The song was sung live on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" with \"Hero\" as a two-piece set-list. Carey performed \"Dreamlover\" on the British music program \"Top of the Pops,\" the Dutch program \"Platendaagse,\" and the Japanese program \"Music Fair\". In a promotional effort for her seventh studio album \"Rainbow,\" Carey filmed a FOX special titled \"The Mariah Carey Homecoming Special\", a mini-concert filmed at her old high school in Huntington, New York. It aired on December 21, 1999. \"Dreamlover\" served as one of the opening numbers. The song was performed in 2003 on \"The Today Show\" as part of a four-song set as a promotion for Carey's 2002 album, \"Charmbracelet.\"\n\nFollowing the televised appearances, Carey performed the song live on several of her tours. In the Daydream World Tour she performed it in front of a backdrop showing footage from the song's video. On her Music Box Tour and Butterfly World Tour, the song served as the fifth song of the set-list. Carey performed alongside several female back-up dancers who mimicked her light dance routines. Carey used a similar presentation on the Rainbow World Tour. On Carey's Charmbracelet and The Adventures of Mimi Tours, three male backup dancers were featured on stage, with the three female background vocalists behind them. On the latter tour, Carey's wore a black bikini, with a matching cape and Christian Louboutin pumps. She mixed the song with an instrumental remix of Mtume's song \"Juicy Fruit.\" Following the release of her twelfth studio album, \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\" (2009), Carey embarked on the Angels Advocate Tour. It was her first tour that did not regularly feature the song, as it was only performed on a few select dates. In addition, Carey sang the song as a part of her Las Vegas residency, \"Mariah Carey Number 1's\" , which chronicles the singer's 18 US Hot 100 Number 1 hits. For the performance, she donned a sequined white dress, and entered the stage in a pink convertible car. At the end of the performance, she stands atop a stage fan, while her skirt blows in the wind, as an homage to Marilyn Monroe.\n\n\nThese credits were adapted from the \"Music Box\" liner notes.\n\n\"Dreamlover\" was recorded at Right Track Studios, New York, and mixed at Sony Music Studios, New York.\n\n\nWorks cited\n"}

It was released in the United States on 11 August 1969 (Epic Records BN 26481 (stereo)), but was not released in the United Kingdom because of a continuing contractual dispute that also prevented \"Sunshine Superman\", \"Mellow Yellow\", and \"The Hurdy Gurdy Man\" from being released in the UK.\n\nWhile the majority of the \"Barabajagal\" sessions took place in November 1968, \"Happiness Runs\" and \"Where Is She\" were recorded the previous May. All of these songs except \"Atlantis\", \"I Love My Shirt\" and \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\" were shelved while \"Donovan's Greatest Hits\" was still high in the charts. \"Atlantis\" / \"I Love My Shirt\" was released as a single in November 1968 in the UK. In the US, \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\" / \"Atlantis\" was released in March 1969. \"Atlantis\" ended up charting higher than its a-side. Some of the songs recorded were originally meant to be included on the unreleased \"Moon In Capricorn\" album.\n\nIn May 1969, Mickie Most produced at least one session with Donovan fronting the Jeff Beck Group. \"Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" (also known as \"Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" and simply \"Barabajagal\") and \"Trudi\" (originally \"Bed with Me\") resulted from these sessions. There were other songs recorded by Donovan and the Jeff Beck Group, but they remained unreleased until they appeared as bonus tracks on the 2005 UK reissue of the album. Rod Stewart was in the band at this time, but he does not sing lead on any of the songs that were released. Tony Newman is featured as drummer.\n\n\"Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" / \"Trudi\" was released as a single in June 1969 in the UK and in August 1969 in the United States. Following the pattern of Donovan's previous releases, his next album was named after the hit single of the time. The inclusion of \"Atlantis\" and \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\" helped make \"Barabajagal\" a strong seller in the United States.\n\nThe songs on this album represent all facets of Donovan's career. Several rockers adorn the album, including the title track, \"Trudi\", \"The Love Song\" and \"Superlungs (My Supergirl)\". \"I Love My Shirt\" updates the sound of Donovan's children's music, and there are several slow songs featuring breathy vocals (\"Where Is She?\", \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\") reminiscent of the \"For Little Ones\" portion of \"A Gift from a Flower to a Garden\". It is during the \"Barabajagal\" sessions that Donovan's musical vision and work ethic began to diverge from that of producer Mickie Most. The two eventually stopped working together, effectively ending Donovan's chart success.\n\n\"Happiness Runs\" is a round sung by Donovan, Graham Nash, Michael McCartney, and Lesley Duncan and was originally released without the round as \"Pebble and the Man\" on \"Donovan in Concert\". \"Superlungs (My Supergirl)\" was originally recorded during the \"Sunshine Superman\" sessions, but was not used for that album. That recording was released on \"Troubadour The Definitive Collection 1964–1976\".

Founded as Russell Creek Academy, a Baptist institution, the university currently enrolls more than 12,000 students and is open to students of all denominations. The university offers associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees.\n\nIn 2014, the university trustees ended its covenant agreement with the Kentucky Baptist Convention, but vowed to uphold the ideals.\n\nCampbellsville University traces its origins to the founding in 1906 of Russell Creek Academy by the Russell Creek Baptist Association. The Academy gradually developed its offerings and a four-year curriculum, becoming accredited as a college. With an expansion of graduate programs, in 1996 the college gained university status.\n\nThe president of the university is Michael V. Carter, Ph.D. The immediate past president is Kenneth W.

This collection contains performance videos, CDs, AV listening/viewing stations, musical scores, music reference books, and music periodicals. There is a conducting room in the basement level for music students to videotape practice and conducting assignments.\n\nNext to the Gosser Fine Arts Center is the University's School of Art. Like Gosser, the School of Art main building also has classrooms, and is to have a computer lab for students who want to learn about art. The School also has a Gallery building and the Tessener complex (which has a printing press room and a classroom), that were once houses.\n\nWhen Campbellsville College gained university status in 1996, the re-organized governance included one college of Arts and Sciences and five schools, including The School of Education, which oversees the preparation of teachers. In the fall of 1996, the School of Education moved its offices into Carter Hall and in 2006 into the new School of Education building. The current dean is Dr. Beverly Ennis. The preparation of teachers has expanded to offering graduate education and online education in a wide variety of certifications and advanced roles. The university offers programs in Louisville, Somerset, and Elizabethtown in addition to the main campus. The School of Education has been accredited by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and the Kentucky Education Professional Standards Board (EPSB) since 2007.\n\nThe campus is situated in the center of Kentucky, about a half mile from downtown Campbellsville, population 9,000. Another portion of the campus, Clay Hill Memorial Forest, is seven miles (11 km) from campus. It is a educational and research woodland that is being developed by the Division of Natural Science as a regional center for environmental education and research. Also, Green River Lake, a recreational state park, is five miles (8 km) from campus.\n\nSince 2002, Campbellsville University has operated an off-site center in Louisville, Kentucky. It moved to nearby Jeffersontown in July 2007.\n\nCampbellsville University also has a satellite center in Hodgenville in LaRue County, the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln. The branch center offers adult education, general education classes, and children's programs. The building in Hodgenville is a gift to CU from Freddie Hilpp.\n\nNearly half of the students enrolled at CU live on campus.\n\nCampbellsville University offers online-degree opportunities.

Campbellsville University offers an RN to BSN that is designed for nurses looking for a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree completion program. The accelerated degree programs are Web-based and allow versatile learning.\n\nCampbellsville University teams are nicknamed as the Tigers and the official colors are maroon and gray. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Mid-South Conference. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, football, cheerleading, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, track & field and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, bowling, cheerleading, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball.\n\nThe original football program was discontinued in 1937 during the Great Depression. The college revived the sport in 1987 under the direction of coach Ron Finley (1933–2009).\n\nSeveral CU teams have received national recognition. Zack Flake, a sophomore from West Chester, Ohio, won Campbellsville's first individual national wrestling championship with his title in the 141-pound weight class in wrestling at the NAIA Wrestling National Championships in 2007. The men's basketball team has had three consecutive berths in the NAIA National Basketball tournament, reaching the National Semi-Final in 2008. The women's basketball team made their record setting 29th appearance in the NAIA National Basketball Tournament in 2018/19,after completing a sweep of the conference regular season title (undefeated), and winning the conference tournament.The Lady Tigers are coached by former Lady Tiger player and 300+ career coaching wins Ginger High Colvin.\nIn 2005, volleyball player Amy Eckenfels was recognized as the NAIA National Libero of the Year. In 2006, she set the all-time national record for career digs with 3,569. The volleyball program advanced to its first-ever NAIA National Volleyball tournament in 2007 by defeating rival Georgetown College in the finals of the Region XI qualifying tournament. Lady Tiger Volleyball advanced to the 2008 NCCAA Final Four but lost to Dallas Baptist to conclude the season with a record of 35–11. CU returned to the NCCAA Volleyball Tournament in 2009, sweeping through the field to win the school's first team national championship in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nIn addition, the Men's Tennis Team has won 3 NCCAA National Championships in 2012, 2015, and 2018\n\nThe school's football team plays at Finley Stadium.\n\n\n"}

He and his business partner Daniel B. Wesson formed two companies named \"Smith & Wesson\", the first of which was eventually reorganized into the Winchester Repeating Arms Company and the latter of which became the modern Smith & Wesson.\n\nBorn in Cheshire, Massachusetts, Smith was employed by the U. S. Armory service from 1824 to 1842, when he moved to Newtown, Connecticut. He was employed by various gun makers up to the 1840s, when he moved to Norwich, Connecticut. He is then listed as a partner of Cranston & Smith. It is known that while in Norwich, he engaged in the manufacture of whaling guns and he is credited with the invention of the explosive bullet used to kill whales.\n\nSmith and Daniel B. Wesson formed a partnership in 1852 for the purpose of developing the magazine arms later to be manufactured under the Smith & Wesson name. They founded the Smith & Wesson Company, with Cortlandt Palmer, in Norwich, Connecticut in 1854 to develop magazine firearms and the Volcanic rifle, the first repeating rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith & Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855, and was financed largely by Oliver Winchester.\n\nIn 1856, the partners left Volcanic Repeating Arms to begin a new company and to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination. Volcanic Repeating Arms was reorganized as the New Haven Arms Company and eventually as the Winchester Repeating Arms Company\n\nIn 1857, Smith and Wesson formed another Smith & Wesson company, this time to produce a pistol with interchangeable parts, a repeating action, a revolving magazine, metallic cartridges, and an open cylinder. They developed more firearms using their own patents along with patents and licenses bought from other gunsmiths.\n\nSmith sold his interest in the company to Wesson in 1874 at the age of 65 and retired.\n\nSmith was married three times: first, to Eliza Foster; second, to Eliza Hebbard Jepson, and third, to Mary Lucretia Hebbard.\n\nSmith died on January 15, 1893. His will apportioned amounts to relatives and institutions and stated that the balance should be used for public purposes at the discretion of his executors. The Horace Smith Fund was established in 1899 from his estate to fund scholarships for worthy graduates from secondary schools in Hampden County, Massachusetts.\n\nR. J. Neal, R. G.

{"id": "1838548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838548", "title": "Active Body Control", "text": "Active Body Control\n\nActive Body Control, or ABC, is the Mercedes-Benz brand name used to describe hydraulic fully active suspension, that allows control of the vehicle body motions and therefore virtually eliminates body roll in many driving situations including cornering, accelerating, and braking. Mercedes-Benz has been experimenting with these capabilities for automobile suspension since the air suspension of the 1963 \"600\" and the hydropneumatic (fluid and air) suspension of the 1974 \"6.9\". \n\nABC is only available on rear-wheel drive models. All-wheel drive models are available only with \"Airmatic\" semi-active air suspension. Production version introduced at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show on the new Mercedes-Benz CL-Class C215.\n\nIn the ABC system, a computer detects body movement from sensors located throughout the vehicle, and controls the action of the active suspension with the use of hydraulic servomechanisms. The hydraulic pressure to the servos is supplied by a high pressure radial piston hydraulic pump. A total of 13 sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle level and supply the ABC controller with new data every ten milliseconds. Four level sensors, one at each wheel measure the ride level of the vehicle, three accelerometers measure the vertical body acceleration, one acceleration sensor measures the longitudinal and one sensor the transverse body acceleration. At each hydraulic cylinder, a pressure sensor monitors the hydraulic pressure. As the ABC controller receives and processes data, it operates four hydraulic servos, each mounted in series on a spring strut, beside each wheel. Almost instantaneously, the servo regulated suspension generates counter forces to body lean, dive and squat during various driving maneuvers. A suspension strut, consisting of a steel coil spring and a shock absorber are connected in parallel, as well as a hydraulically controlled adjusting cylinder, are located between the vehicle body and wheel. These components adjust the cylinder in the direction of the suspension strut, and change the suspension length. This creates a force which acts on the suspension and dampening of the vehicle in the frequency range up to five hertz. The reliable function of the ABC system requires a regular hydraulic oil change and filter replacement.\n\nThe system also incorporates height adjustable suspension, which in this case lowers the vehicle up to between the speeds of for better aerodynamics, fuel consumption, and handling.\n\nThe ABC system also allows self-levelling suspension, which raises or lowers the vehicle in response to changing load (i.e. the loading or unloading of passengers or cargo). Each vehicle equipped with ABC has an “ABC Sport” button that allows the driver to adjust the suspension range for different driving style preferences. This feature allows the driver to adjust the suspension to maintain a more level ride in more demanding driving conditions.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C112 of 1991, Mercedes-Benz Vario Research Car of 1995 and the Mercedes-Benz F200 of 1996 already featured prototype versions of ABC.\n\nThe first complete and ready-for-production version of ABC was introduced in 1999 on the top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz CL-Class\n\nIn 2010 a crosswind stabilization function was introduced. In strong gusts of crosswind, and depending on the direction and intensity of the wind having an effect on the vehicle, this system varies the wheel load distribution in such a way that the effects of winds are largely compensated or reduced to a minimum. For this purpose the ABC control unit uses the yaw rate, lateral acceleration, steering angle and road speed sensors of the Electronic Stability Program ESP®.\n\nIn 2007, the Mercedes-Benz F700 concept introduced the PRE-SCAN suspension, an early prototype road scanning suspension, using lidar sensors, based on Active Body Control.\n\nIn 2013 the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) introduced the series production version of PRE-SCAN, but with a stereo camera instead of laser projectors. The system dubbed Magic Body Control is fitted with a road-sensing system (Road Surface Scan) that pre-loads the shocks for the road surface detected. Using a stereo camera, the system scans the road surface up to 15 meters ahead of the vehicle at speeds up to , and it adjusts the shock damping at each wheel to account for imperfections in the road. Initially only available on 8-cylinder models and above, Magic Ride Control attempts to isolate the car's body by predicting rather than reacting to broken pavement and speed humps. The ABC has undergone major modifications for the new S-Class: the wheel damping is now continuously adjustable, the spring strut response has been improved and the pump efficiency has been further enhanced. A digital interface connects the control unit and the sensors, while the fast FlexRay bus connects the control unit and the vehicle electronics. Processing power is more than double that of the previous system.\n\nIn 2014 the new C217 S-Class Coupe introduced an update to Magic Body Control, called Active Curve Tilting. This new system allows the vehicle to lean up to 2.5 degrees into a turn, similar to a tilting train. The leaning is intended to counter the effect of centrifugal force on the occupants and is available only on rear-wheel drive models\n\nVehicles, chronological order:\n\n\n"}

Their work was characterized by its \"rock against rock\" attitude and defied classification with its incorporation of marching band routines, puppet shows, and the playing of household items as tuned instruments.\n\nAdopting the Idiot Flesh moniker in 1987, they went on to release three full-length albums before disbanding in 1998. Founding members Nils Frykdahl and Dan Rathbun later played in Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, while Gene Jun later joined the Sun and Moon Ensemble.\n\nThe group formed in Barrington Hall, a student co-op at the University of California at Berkeley, in 1985 as Acid Rain. Guitarist and composer Frykdahl (\"Pin\"), bassist Rathbun (\"The Improver\"), and guitarist and violinist Jun (\"Captain Dragon\") formed the group's core lineup, along with early drummers David Shamrock and Daniel Roth. Their demo album \"We Were All Very Worried\" was released as a cassette-only edition in 1987. They changed their name to Idiot Flesh prior to the release of their first vinyl album, \"Tales of Instant Knowledge and Sure Death\", in 1990, which also featured drummer/artist Chuck Squier.\n\nThe band was known to tour the US in a converted city bus with Rathbun as the driver/mechanic, with the windshield destination banner set for \"HELL.\" Their live set incorporated stage performers and characters known as the Filthy Rotten Excuse Chickens, \"a motley bunch that enhances the Idiot Flesh experience with a variety of acrobatics, dancing and pantomime\". These characters used such stage names as The Minotaurs of Baal, Beefra The Cook, Helpy The Hamburger Bee, Mr. Punch, Hatcha & Datcha: the Siamese Twins, Ming Tsao: Professor of Black Math, Uro Butoh, El Evil, Ward C. Picnic, The Queen of Oakland, and Mumble.\n\n\"The Nothing Show\", their second album, appeared in 1993, and drummer Wes Anderson (\"Hyena Boy\") replaced Squier. Extensive touring followed, including several runs with the Czech avant-punk band Už Jsme Doma. They also appeared in the movie \"Oakland Underground\", which has around three minutes of a secret Idiot Flesh show, and in which Frykdahl and Jun both had bit parts.\n\nThe followup, 1997's \"Fancy\", was released on four different formats: digipak, digipak re-press, standard jewel case and hand-made metal slipcase, the latter in very limited quantity. Although work began on an unnamed fourth album, it has yet to surface. Their final show was held on Friday, March 13, 1998, at the Transmission Theater in San Francisco. The group disbanded shortly thereafter.\n\nFrykdahl, Rathbun and Shamrock went on to form Sleepytime Gorilla Museum with Carla Kihlstedt, with whom they and Anderson had worked in Charming Hostess. Frykdahl also became a core member of the group Faun Fables with Dawn McCarthy. Jun later formed the jam band BARGOOMA!! and joined the Sun and Moon Ensemble. Anderson went on to work with Les Claypool, Cirque du Soleil, The Fuxedos, Casino Royale, Kehoe Nation, and Schloss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is called a 'stripper' clip because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper clip is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the user presses on the cartridges from above, sliding them down and off the clip, thereby \"stripping\" them off the clip and into the magazine. Stripper clips differ from en bloc clips in that they are not designed to be inserted into the weapon itself, but only to load it or its magazine.\n\nStripper clips were originally employed in infantry bolt action rifles, such as the Russian Mosin–Nagant, the British Lee–Enfield, and the German Gewehr 98 and its variant the Mauser K98k, the related US M1903 Springfield and many others. Stripper clips were also employed in newer, semi-automatic rifles with internal box magazines, such as the Soviet SKS and Egyptian Hakim Rifle.\n\nCurrently they are used to top-off detachable box magazines for semi-automatic and automatic rifles. A magazine loader is placed on the lip of the box magazine, the clip is placed inside the loader, and then the rounds are pushed into the magazine.\n\nIt is called a \"stripper\" clip because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper clip is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the user presses on the cartridges from above, sliding them down and off the clip, thereby stripping them off the clip and into the magazine. After the magazine is loaded, the stripper clip is removed and set aside for reloading, or simply discarded during combat. \n\nGenerally, a weapon that can use a stripper clip for loading can also be loaded one round at a time, while a weapon designed for an \"en bloc\" clip cannot be used without the clip.\n\nDepending on the firearm, magazine, and cartridge, stripper clips come in a variety of shapes, some quite complex, though most are either straight or crescent-shaped pieces of stamped metal—usually brass, steel (often blued or parkerized), or plastic.\n\nStripper/charger clips have been used since 1889 (in the form of the Mauser Model 1889, while en bloc clips have been used since roughly the mid-late 1880s. En bloc clips, as used in the M1 Garand as well as the Italian Carcano are designed to be inserted into the magazine itself, essentially a part of the magazine, while stripper clips are intended to load ammo into the magazine while the magazine is intended to load ammo into the chamber. The M1891 Three Line Rifle (aka the first \"Mosin-Nagant\") utilized stripper clips, however the design was improved upon later, namely by Mauser. Mauser clips are inherently smoother and eject automatically upon closing the bolt, while Mosin-Nagant clips require a special technique to get anywhere near the same efficiency but must be manually removed before you can close the bolt, making it inherently slower. Still, it is faster than reloading with single cartridges. Moreover, once some but not all rounds have been fired Mauser clip format guns are as a rule difficult or impossible to top-up to their maximum capacity again with additional cartridges, which is generally easy with stripper-clip loading weapons.\n\nStripper clips were originally employed in infantry bolt action rifles, such as the Russian Mosin–Nagant, the British Lee–Enfield, and the German Gewehr 98 and its variant the Mauser K98k, the related US M1903 Springfield and many others.

Wesson\n\nDaniel Baird Wesson (May 18, 1825 – August 4, 1906) was an American inventor and firearms designer. He helped develop several influential firearm designs over the course of his life; he and Horace Smith were the co-founders of two companies named \"Smith & Wesson\", the first of which was eventually reorganized into the Winchester Repeating Arms Company and the latter of which became the modern Smith & Wesson.\n\nDaniel Baird Wesson was the son of Rufus and Betsey (Baird) Wesson. Daniel's father was a farmer and manufacturer of wooden plows and Daniel worked on his father's farm and attended public school until the age of eighteen, when he apprenticed himself to his brother Edwin Wesson (a leading manufacturer of target rifles and pistols in the 1840s) in Northborough, Massachusetts.\n\nWesson was married to Cynthia Maria Hawes, May 26, 1847, in Thompson, Connecticut. Hawes' father objected to the couple's engagement fearing that Wesson was a \"mere gunsmith\" with no future, forcing the couple to elope. Wesson's salary at Smith & Wesson amounted to over $160,000 a year by 1865.\n\nThe couple had one daughter and three sons: Sarah Jeannette Wesson (1848–1927); Walter Herbert Wesson (1850–1921); Frank Luther Wesson (1853–1887); and Joseph Hawes Wesson (1859–1920). Frank died in a train accident on the Central Vermont Railway. Walter and Joseph became executives at Smith & Wesson.\n\nIn 1854, Daniel B. Wesson partnered with Horace Smith and Courtlandt Palmer to develop a lever-action pistol and the first repeating rifle—the Volcanic. Production was in the shop of Horace Smith in Norwich, Connecticut. Originally using the name \"Smith & Wesson Company\", the name was changed to \"Volcanic Repeating Arms Company\" in 1855, with the addition of new investors, one of whom was Oliver Winchester. The Volcanic Repeating Arms Company obtained all rights for the Volcanic designs (both rifle and pistol versions were in production by this time) as well as the ammunition, from the Smith & Wesson Company. Wesson remained as plant manager for eight months before rejoining Smith to found the \"Smith & Wesson Revolver Company\" upon obtaining the licensing of the Rollin White \"rear loading cylinder\" patent.\n\nIn 1856, Smith & Wesson began to produce a small revolver designed to fire the rimfire cartridge they had patented in August 1854. This revolver was the first successful fully self-contained cartridge revolver available in the world. Smith & Wesson secured patents for the revolver to prevent other manufacturers from producing a cartridge revolver – giving the young company a very lucrative business.\n\nAt the age of 65, Smith retired from the company and sold his share of the business to Wesson, making him the sole owner of the firm. In the late 1800s the company introduced its line of hammerless revolvers, a style that is still produced.\n\nIn 1899, Smith & Wesson introduced what is arguably the most famous revolver in the world, the .38 Military & Police (renamed the Model 10 in 1957). This revolver has been in continual production since that year and has been used by virtually every police agency and military force around the world.\n\nWesson remained active in the firm until his death. Wesson died at his home in Springfield, Massachusetts, on August 4, 1906—following a four-year illness, he succumbed to \"...heart failure, superinduced by neuritis.\" His wife had died the month prior. The Wessons are buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Springfield.\n\nWesson, a strong advocate of homeopathy, had funded a new building for the Hampden Homeopathic Hospital in Springfield through a donation of $100,000 in 1904. The hospital, later known as Wesson Memorial Hospital, switched from homeopathy to modern-day medicine in 1923, and became part of Baystate Medical Center through a merger in 1976.\n\nGrandson Douglas B. Wesson worked in the family business and helped create the .357 Magnum in the 1930s. Great-grandson Daniel B. Wesson II followed the family tradition, working in the family business for 30 years and then founding his own company, which later became known as Dan Wesson Firearms.\n\nWesson was involved in the construction of 13 houses. One that is still standing is now known as the Grand Army of the Republic Hall in Worcester, Massachusetts, which was built for his daughter Sarah and was designed by Calvert Vaux. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Wesson also helped fund construction of the French Congregational Church and South Congregational Church, both in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nWesson lived and worked in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, building hospitals and a home there. Wesson’s primary home was located at 50 Maple Street in Springfield and was the city’s most extravagant mansion. Wesson hired New York architect Bruce Price to design his residence in the early 1890's. The design was published in \"The American Architect and Building News\" in 1893. The house was three and a half stories in height and constructed of pink granite with a red slate roof and bronze cresting and finials. Stylistically, it was adapted from the French chateaux of the Renaissance. Completed in 1898, the house cost between $350,000 and $450,000. Following Wesson's death, the mansion was turned over to the Connecticut Valley Historical Society in 1911, contingent upon the society raising $100,000 for maintenance of the property, which they were unable to do. In 1915, it became the clubhouse for the Colony Club of Springfield, remaining as such until fire destroyed the building on February 20, 1966.\n\nWesson had apprenticed in Northborough, Massachusetts, at his brother Edwin's gunsmith shop, and met his future wife there. The business moved to Hartford, Connecticut, in 1848. Later, Wesson built a summer home in Northborough on land partially belonging to his wife's family, which was completed in 1886 a cost of approximately $300,000. It is an example of shingle style architecture. The house had 17 fireplaces and 32 rooms, along with elaborate carvings, stained glass windows, and gas-lit chandeliers. Water for the house and grounds was sourced from a nearby pond, with a pumping station and cistern, fed by approximately of pipe.\n\nAfter Wesson's death in 1906, the house stayed in the family for a few years then was sold in 1910, and subsequently went through multiple owners. It was used as a restaurant as far back as 1946, as a restaurant and function hall until 1985, and later just as a function hall. It was again put up for sale in January 2014, and closed to the public in December 2014.\n\nDue to lack of a buyer, it was scheduled to be demolished in 2016. However, the town of Northborough voted in April 2016 to purchase it. The town approved funds to purchase the property at 167 Main Street for $1.75 million, plus additional funding for future development, with a total allocation of $2.4 million.\n\nThe house is known locally, and was operated as a restaurant and function hall, under the name \"White Cliffs\". The origin of the name has been attributed to the White Cliffs of Dover area in England. Either due to Wesson having a painting of those chalk cliffs that he placed over the mantle that faced the house's main entrance, or due to an Irish waitress who worked at the restaurant in its early years singing \"The White Cliffs of Dover\" while doing her prep work.\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Rider College in 1965 and went on to receive a Master's Degree in history at American University. He was then hired by American University as a fundraiser, and was eventually appointed Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid.\n\nIn 1982, von Kloberg began a public relations and lobbying firm, named van Kloberg & Associates, which was renamed the Washington World Group in 1992. In 1984, he was convicted of filing false financial statements with a Washington bank in connection with loan application. He was sentenced to one year probation. Von Kloberg, who often referred to his clients as \"the damned,\" eventually went on to represent Saddam Hussein, Samuel K. Doe of Liberia, Nicolae Ceauşescu of Romania, Mobutu Sésé Seko of the then-Zaire and the Burmese embassy in the United States. Upon the overthrow of Mobutu, von Kloberg then represented the government of Laurent Kabila, whose forces had pushed Mobutu from power.\n\nIn 1996, von Kloberg represented the apparel manufacturers of Honduras, who were being accused of sexual abuse and child labor. He later admitted that his clients had been guilty of the accusations, but insisted that his representation of them had led to reforms.\n\nVon Kloberg was known for his flamboyant personal style. He affected the title \"Baron\", and was frequently seen wearing a black opera cape, either lined with red silk or with silk in a dove pattern, and a sash decorated with medals given to him by clients. He traveled with steamer trunks, and was driven in a black limousine also decorated with medals and badges.\n\nThe authors of the book \"Washington Babylon\" wrote of von Kloberg, \"Even within the amoral world of Washington lobbying, <nowiki>[he]</nowiki> stands out for handling clients that no one else will touch.\" \"Washingtonian\" magazine once labeled him one of the city's \"hired guns\".

His voice work includes the cartoon series \"The Ant and the Aardvark\", in which the title characters are voiced by Byner's impressions of Dean Martin and Jackie Mason, respectively.\n\nOn \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", where he made his first early TV appearances, he mimicked Ed Sullivan among many others. Other impressions included John Wayne and he sings as Dean Martin and Johnny Mathis. His ability to mimic \"Toastmaster General\" George Jessel came in handy during his appearances on panel programs such as celebrity \"roasts\" and other tributes.\n\nOn a 1967 episode of \"Get Smart\", he played a KAOS agent who made a phone call to the Chief of CONTROL (played by Edward Platt), performed a perfect impression of President Lyndon B. Johnson, and told the Chief he was fired and replaced with agent Maxwell Smart (Don Adams).\n\nIn 1970-71, he hosted 22 episodes of \"Something Else\", a syndicated half-hour musical variety series. He then hosted his own show in 1972 called the \"John Byner Comedy Hour\", where the character Super Dave was first introduced. That same year, he had a cameo appearance in \"What's Up, Doc?\" In the mid-1970s, he guest starred in two episodes of \"The Odd Couple\". \n\nByner played a comedian/impersonator aboard a cruise ship in season 6 of \"Hawaii Five-O\". His character, Duffy Malone, did impersonations of John Wayne and then got hit on the back of his head as a diversionary tactic by the bad guy. He had a recurring role in the situation comedy \"The Practice\" during its first season in 1976.\n\nIn the late 1970s, he had a featured role as Detective Donahue on the TV series \"Soap\". He was cast in \"Happy Days\" as Mork from Ork but found the premise ridiculous, so he declined the role days before filming began. Robin Williams was called in at the last minute, and that substitution proved to be a career-making part for the comedian who deeply impressed everyone with his talent.\n\nIn the 1970s, Byner appeared several times on \"The Carol Burnett Show\", where in one comedy sketch he wore a Donald Duck costume and mimicked the cartoon character's distinctive voice. He appeared several times on talk shows hosted by David Letterman.\n\nIn the 1980s, he hosted \"Bizarre\", which re-introduced many people to hapless daredevil Super Dave Osborne played by Bob Einstein. In 1983 he had a role as \"Doc,\" who was Burt Reynolds's longtime childhood friend in the movie \"Stroker Ace\". In 1985 The Walt Disney Company's animated feature \"The Black Cauldron\" was released, featuring Byner voicing the characters Gurgi and Doli. He was a regular celebrity guest on \"Hollywood Squares\" during the John Davidson years and later hosted the 1988-89 syndicated game show \"Relatively Speaking\". He appeared in an episode of \"\" as a washed-up ventriloquist.\n\nOn May 26, 2017, it was reported that Byner had been cast in a supporting role in the Amazon Video horror anthology series \"Lore\", which is based on the podcast of the same name. Byner portrays Patrick Boland, the father of Bridget Cleary (played by Holland Roden). \"Lore\" premiered on October 13, 2017.\n\nByner was born John Biener in New York City, the son of Christina, a mental hospital attendant, and Michael Biener, a truck mechanic. Byner has been married four times, and has four children with his first wife Eleanor Belcher. One of his children, Don (Donny) Byner, looks just like his father and appeared for the first time on TV dressed as a leprechaun on \"Captain's Log with Captain Mark Gray\". He has been married to Anne Gaybis since 1992.\n\n"}
{"id": "1838572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838572", "title": "CAL (programming language)", "text": "CAL (programming language)\n\nCAL, short for Conversational Algebraic Language, was a programming language and system designed and developed by Butler Lampson at Berkeley in 1967 for the SDS 940 mainframe computer. CAL is a version of the seminal JOSS language with a number of cleanups and new features to take advantage of the SDS platform.\n\nThe Berkeley SDS was used for the development of the Tymshare commercial time-sharing platform and an improved version of CAL was offered as a programming environment to its customers in 1969. Although CAL saw \"almost no use\", it had a lasting impact by influencing the design of Tymshare SUPER BASIC which copied a number of its features. Some of those features, in turn, appeared in BASIC-PLUS on the PDP-11, which is the direct ancestor of Microsoft BASIC.\n\nJOSS had been designed to be used by non-programmers in the US Air Force and within Rand Corporation, and to aid with that, Rand designed custom computer terminals that were easier to set up and use. These terminals, based on the IBM Selectric typewriter, also included a custom character set that implemented common mathematical symbols like and .\n\nTo a large degree, CAL was a version of JOSS that replaced these sorts of customizations with more common solutions like and so they could run on common terminals. The other noticeable differences were that CAL was all upper-case, as opposed to sentence casing in JOSS, and it did not require a period at the end of the line. The commands were otherwise almost identical and the overall structure and syntax the same.\n\nAs with JOSS, CAL had an interactive user interface that allowed the user to type in statements in \"direct mode\" or programs to be run in \"indirect mode\". In BASIC, the former is more commonly referred to as \"immediate mode\". Both CAL and JOSS used a two-part line number, known as the part and step, separated by a period, for instance, for part 1 step 100. Parts were generally used to group related statements into subroutines. In CAL, the part number could be between 0 and 999999, and the step from 0 to 99999.\n\nThere were two main versions of CAL, released in 1967 and 1969. The following description will be based primarily on the former version unless otherwise noted.\n\nAs in JOSS, CAL supported the command to branch to a provided part or step, as in or , and for subroutine calls, as in to perform the entire part, or to run that single step and then return. The later syntax was useful when there were many small subroutines as they could be implemented on a single line without an associated or similar concept.\n\nOne of the more notable syntactic features of JOSS was the concept of \"statement modifiers\" which controlled the operation of other statements. JOSS used this for conditional branching.\n\nIn most languages, one would write something to the effect of \"if this expression is true, then do this...\". In JOSS, this order was reversed, and such statements took the form \"do this if this is true\", for instance, . CAL added some syntactic sugar to this basic concept by adding the new modifier , which, depending on context, led to more obvious code; .\n\nCAL further modified the basic if statement by adding and . In JOSS, if one wanted to assign the value 5 to a variable A if the value of B was larger than 10, and 0 otherwise, the code would be:\n\nThis sort of either/or assignment is very common and takes up two lines. CAL improved on JOSS by implementing an :\n\nA similar modification was the statement, used to set variables as part of an if or for. It was similar in concept to the if/then/else structure, but could have any number of items. For instance.\n\nLooping in JOSS was also controlled by a modifier, the . This used somewhat obscure syntax; runs a loop from 1 to 10 stepping by 2, so it would print 1,3,5,7,9. One could also supply explicit values, , or mix the two, \n\nCAL improved on JOSS' syntax by introducing the and keywords, so the equivalent code in CAL would be . In JOSS, the parenthesis around the step value was the separator for the two limits, so it could not be made optional. By separating out the limits became explicit and the was made optional as assumed to be 1; . As with JOSS, explicit values and ranges could be used; . CAL further modified the for loop by adding conditional exits, using and . For instance, or .\n\nJOSS allowed the user to define functions using the statement. The syntax allowed local variables to be named in the function signature; Programs could then call these functions as if they were built-in, \n\nCAL changed to , which is much more obvious, and made a more minor change the parameters were passed in using braces instead of parenthesis, so the equivalent definition would be and called in the same way, .\n\nA more important change to CAL's functions was the ability to call subroutines from the definitions using , as in . This left the issue of assigning the resulting calculated value back to the function, which was addressed with the introduction of the statement at the end of the part, where Z is the final value to be returned.\n\nCAL included the mathematical functions of JOSS but added a number of new ones including , , , and . It added a new operator as well, , which returned the remainder of a division of its two operands.\n\nCAL added a small number of direct mode commands and associated statements. \n\n, when encountered in a program, printed a message \"PAUSED AT STEP 1.1\" and then returned to direct mode. This was similar to the command in BASIC. This allowed the user to type in values and the continue execution with . While in direct mode, the user could by a single line at a time to trace the execution of the program.\n\nCAL changed JOSS' user-defined function to the somewhat more obvious , while also changing the parameter list to use [] instead of (). In JOSS these were normally found in direct mode, whereas in CAL they were only allowed in direct mode. For instance, one could . This example also demonstrates JOSS' ability to use a loop range as the input to a function. In contrast to JOSS, CAL allowed multi-step functions by adding additional statements separated by a colon, for instance, . Note that this example has no body, it simply calls c\n\nOne minor change in the 1969 version was the elimination of the command for variable assignment. This had been optional in direct mode in JOSS but was required in program statements, and the 1967 version of CAL had followed this rule. The 1969 version made it optional in both cases.\n\n"}

The couple had two children: a daughter, Satella, and a son, Leon Stewart.\n\nSharps was hired as an apprentice gunsmith at the Harpers Ferry Arsenal in the 1830s. While at Harpers Ferry, he was introduced to the Hall rifle, an early breech-loader, and worked for its inventor, Captain John H. Hall. Sharps also became versed in the manufacture of weapons with fully interchangeable parts.\nSharps' first rifle was patented September 12, 1848, a breech loading design it featured \"slanting breech action\" and used paper cartridges. It was manufactured by \"A. S. Nippes\" at Mill Creek, (Philadelphia) Pennsylvania, in 1850.\n\nIn 1851, Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company (later renamed \"Sharps Rifle Co\") was organized as a holding company with $1,000 in capital and with John C. Palmer as president, Christian Sharps as engineer, and Richard S. Lawrence as master armorer and superintendent of manufacturing. Sharps was to be paid a royalty of $1 per firearm and the factory was built on R&L's property in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nChristian Sharps left the company in 1855 to form his own manufacturing company called \"C. Sharps & Co.\" which produced four-barrel derringers, and later renamed \"Sharps & Hankins\", in partnership with William Hankins, in 1862. Both firms were located in Philadelphia. Sharps & Hankins not only produced four-barrel derringers, but also the single-shot Model 1861 Navy Rifles and the Model 1862 Carbines, both of which featured forward \"sliding breech actions\" and fired the .56-52 Spencer rimfire metallic cartridge. The Sharps and Hankins partnership ended in 1867, and Sharps resumed the manufacturing of firearms under the C. Sharps and Co. name.\n\nIn 1870, Sharps and his family moved to Vernon, Connecticut, where he continued working on firearm designs and started a large trout farming business.\n\nSuccumbing to tuberculosis, Sharps died in Vernon, on March 12, 1874. In all, he was awarded a total of fifteen firearms-related patents. \"C. Sharps & Co.\" was shuttered after his death and firearms production came to an end. Although, \"Sharps Rifle Co\" continued to produce his namesake rifles until 1881, when it too closed its doors.\n\nIn 1983, Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Company began to produce a line of modern reproductions of the legendary 1874 Sharps Rifle, featured in the 1990 Western film Quigley Down Under, starring Tom Selleck. Previously, the Sharps rifle reproductions were manufactured by \"Shiloh Products Inc.\" founded by Len Mulé (pronounce Mull-A) in partnership with Wolfgang Droge. Len Mulé is considered the second founder of Sharps and responsible for its re-introduction into the modern era.\n\nSharps was issued a patent for his design of a breech-loading rifle on September 12, 1848. The deficiencies of the Hall rifle may have caused Sharps to adopt his new design. The Sharps rifle was designed with a vertical dropping block action, operated by a lever which also served as a trigger guard. The action was not only strong but limited the release of gases when the gun was discharged. Sharps' first rifle, the Model 1849, was manufactured by A.S. Nippes & Co. at Mill Creek, Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.\n\nDespite not being the first breech-loading rifle, Sharps' was the first to be accepted widely and, with the onset of the American Civil War, the first to be produced in large quantities. The Sharps, in a carbine version, was the most widely used cavalry carbine by the Union Army. It was so successful that it was copied and manufactured by the Confederate government to arm its mounted troops. Sharps-designed firearms later saw extensive use in the American West as military and hunting weapons. They were highly regarded as target rifles and were used extensively in international shooting competitions through the late 19th century.\n\nOne of the more common derringers found in the \"Old West\" were the Sharps Derringers. They are four-barrel, single-action derringers with a revolving firing pin. They come in .22, .30 and .32 rimfire, and their four barrels slide forward to load and unload. First patented in 1849, they were not made until 1859, when Sharps patented a practical derringer design. These first model derringers had brass frames and fired the recently introduced .22 Rimfire metallic cartridges. The second model was a .30 Rimfire derringer. These pistols were made by \"C. Sharps and Co\", and are sometimes classified by modern collectors as a pepperbox.\n\nIn 1862 William Hankins partnered with Sharps, bringing much needed funding and the company was renamed \"Sharps & Hankins\". They introduced the third model derringer in .32 Rimfire, with an iron frame, and the barrel release was moved from under the frame to the left side of the frame. These were discontinued when the partnership ended in 1867. In the same year, the newly renamed \"C. Sharps and Co\" introduced the fourth model derringer with a new \"birdshead\" grip and slightly shorter barrels, otherwise it was virtually identical to the third model. Production of these little pistols came to an end with the death of Christian Sharps in 1874. Approximately 100,000 of these derringers were made between 1859 and 1874.\n\n\n"}

Released on her debut single in 1983, Brown's satire of Valley girl culture also parodies 1950s'-1960s' \"teen tragedy\" songs. \n\nThe song and its music video begins as a satire of a 1950s' doo-wop song, recounting the homecoming dance in which her best friend, Debi, is crowned queen. Once that happens, the tone changes to 1980s synthpop as Debi unexpectedly pulls out a weapon and begins indiscriminately killing classmates and teachers at the parade (the singer, in keeping with the Valley Girl stereotype of being oblivious and self-absorbed, shows remarkable lack of sympathy for the deaths of the entire glee club and the math teacher). In the end, the police fire a warning shot at Debi, which proves unexpectedly fatal; the singer runs to Debi's side and asks her why she went on the killing spree. As her last words, Debi confesses that she \"did it for Johnny\", leaving her friend to ponder who she meant, as the only person named Johnny in the class was a nerdy classmate who always had food stuck in his braces. The friend compares the mystery of \"Johnny\" to one in classic cinema: \"It's like that movie \"Citizen Kane\", you know, where you later find out that 'Rosebud' is his sled? / But we'll never know who Johnny was, 'cause, like, she's dead!\"\n\nA censored version of the song changes the line \"I almost wet my jeans\" to \"I almost ripped my seam\", \"It's like the whole school was totally coked or something\" became the non-rhyming \"I mean, like, it made me really proud to be a teenager!\" and \"Are you having a really bad period?\" became \"You'll get suspended if you don't quit it\".\n\nThe song first appeared as a B-side to Brown's 1983 self-released single \"I Like 'em Big and Stupid\", and took off after frequent play on \"The Dr. Demento Show\" led to radio airplay around the US. It would become what music critic Jonathan Taylor called \"one of the most delightfully silly singles and videos of the past few years.\" \n\n\"The Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun\" was re-released (along with its A-side) on Brown's 1984 EP \"Goddess in Progress\" on Rhino Records (RNEP610). It also appears on the novelty label's subsequent release – the compilation \"Teenage Tragedies\" (RNEP611) – packaged with nine other songs, original '50s and '60s \"death discs\" of the type her song parodies. It also appears on the 1991 Rhino compilation \"Dr. Demento 20th Anniversary Collection\". A re-recorded dance version appeared as a B-side to Brown's 2005 single \"I Want to Be Gay\".\n\nAt least one reviewer cited the song as evidence of a sea change in novelty songs, observing: \"The songs got sicker and more nihilistic. In 1960, a pretty girl wore an 'Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini'; in 1985, a pretty girl in Julie Brown's cult classic \"The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun\" grabs a machine gun and does a Rambo on most of the senior class.\" \n\nThe song was ranked No. 488 in the KROQ Flashback 500 of 1988 and No. 324 in the KROQ-FM Flashback 500 of 1996. It was included in a special by the Australian national radio station Triple J on school songs in 2001. \n\nBrown admitted in a July 2000 interview that after the Columbine High School massacre she no longer felt comfortable performing \"Homecoming Queen\", even though the circumstances of the song were quite different from the real-life events, and it had been comic at the time of its debut. \"I can be very sensitive about whether I am doing something that will hurt people,\" Brown said. \"So you are always drawing the comedy line of what you will or won't do.\"\n\nIn October 2008, Brown released a re-written version, \"The Ex-Beauty Queen's Got a Gun,\" parodying Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during Palin's bid for election with John McCain. Available digitally only, the low-budget recording has Brown singing new lyrics over a previously released karaoke version of the original song. As such, the prerecorded backing vocals sing words that do not match the new lyrics.\n"}

United States, 249 U.S. 211 (1919), was a United States Supreme Court decision, relevant for US labor law and constitutional law, that upheld the Espionage Act of 1917.\n\nEugene V. Debs was an American labor and political leader and five-time Socialist Party of America candidate for the American Presidency. On June 16, 1918 Debs made an anti-war speech in Canton, Ohio, protesting US involvement in World War I. He was arrested under the Espionage Act of 1917 and convicted, sentenced to serve ten years in prison and to be disenfranchised for life.\n\nThe case against Debs was based on a document entitled \"Anti-War Proclamation and Program,\" showing that Debs' original intent was to openly protest against the war. The argument of the Federal Government was that Debs was attempting to arouse mutiny and treason by preventing the drafting of soldiers into the United States Army. This type of speech was outlawed in the United States with the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917. The defense argued that Debs was entitled to the rights of free speech provided for in the first amendment of the Bill of Rights. This was one of three cases decided in 1919 in which the Court had upheld convictions that restricted free speech.\n\nIn its ruling on \"Debs v. United States,\" the Court examined several statements that Debs had made regarding the war. While he had tempered his speeches in an attempt to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had shown the \"intention and effect of obstructing the draft and recruitment for the war.\" Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. In his opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated that Debs' case was essentially the same as \"Schenck v. United States\" (1919), in which the Court upheld a similar conviction. The Supreme Court decided against Debs, and maintained the power of the \"Espionage Act.\" Debs' sentence to ten years imprisonment and loss of citizenship was upheld. Holmes J said the following:\n\nDebs went to prison on April 13, 1919. While in federal prison, he was nomination for president by the Socialist Party of America in the 1920 Election for the fifth and final time despite his disfranchisement. He received 919,799 votes (3.4% of the popular vote), the most ever for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S. It was slightly more than his 900,672 total in the 1912 election, which had equaled six percent of the popular vote. (National women's suffrage in 1920 greatly increased the total number of votes cast.)\n\nIn 1921, Congress largely repealed the Espionage and Sedition Acts. On December 23, 1921 President Warren G. Harding commuted Debs' sentence to time served, effective Christmas Day. He did not issue a pardon. The two met the following day at the White House.\n\n\n"}

The blast was the deadliest Shining Path bombing during the Internal conflict in Peru and was part of a larger bombing campaign in the city.\n\nThe explosions happened on Avenida Larco, in the business area of Miraflores, an upscale district of the city. Two trucks, each packed with 1,000 kg of explosives, exploded on the street at 9:15 pm outside the Bank “Banco de Crédito” of Peru, killing 25 and wounding 155. The blast destroyed or damaged 183 homes, 400 businesses and 63 parked cars. The bombings were the beginning of a week-long Shining Path strike against the Peruvian government, a strike which caused 40 deaths and shut down much of the capital.\n\nIn the wake of the incident, galvanized by public outrage, President Alberto Fujimori intensified his crackdown on Peruvian insurgent groups.\n\nIn 1992, Peru was in the midst of terrorists groups, the most radical and active of which was Shining Path, a militant offshoot of the Peruvian Communist Party. That year, a coup led by President Alberto Fujimori on April 5, in which he dissolved Congress as part of a broader political crackdown, aggravated the domestic social conflict.\n\nEarlier Shining Path attacks that year included the February 15 murder of María Elena Moyano, a community organizer in Villa El Salvador Ward, who was shot at close range then blown up with dynamite. Also, on June 5 a car bomb exploded beside the Frecuencia Latina television station near midnight, killing journalist Alejandro Perez one of the survivors was Magali Veran.\n\nThe attack took place on Thursday July 16 and targeted the Credit Bank of Peru located on Avenida Larco. During the day, Shining Path forces in Lima conducted attacks against police stations and smaller financial institutions in order to disperse the police and clear the way for the main attack. Near the planned time, there was a wavering in electric power followed by one of the blackouts common in the city at that time. \n\nAccording to testimony of Shining Path militants interviewed by the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the twelfth Shining Path detachment in Lima, commanded by \"Comrade Daniel\" (later identified as Carlos Mora La Madrid in the Commission's records), was responsible for conducting the attack.\n\nThe original plan was to set off explosives in front of that bank at 9:20 pm, but the establishment did not allow them to park in the place agreed. They therefore decided to leave their vehicle at the next intersection (which was Tarata Street) and allow it to drift forward until it exploded. Once in the street, the driver slowed down and abandoned the truck.\n\nThe explosive payload was 400—500 kilograms of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil mixed with dynamite. The buildings most affected by their locations near the center of the blast were El Condado, San Pedro, Tarata, Central Residential and San Carlos. The shock wave extended for 300 meters. The explosion killed 25, wounded 155, and caused more than US$3 million in damage.\n\nResponse from around the world denounced the Shining Path and expressed support with the Peruvian government and people in overcoming the situation. \n\nAccording to specialists, it was the first time in the course of the civil war that \"traditional\" Lima society experienced the conflict. It was the first time that a terrorist act was carried out against a large-scale civilian target and the first direct attack on a city center.\n\nThe attack also led to self-examinations within the Shining Path, whose main leaders recognized the act as a \"mistake\" that should not have happened because it did not advance the group's main objective.\n\nThis attack was used as a justification for the La Cantuta massacre two days later on July 18, in which nine students and one teacher at the National University of Education Enrique Guzmán y Valle, Shining Path suspects, were kidnapped and disappeared during the night by members of the Grupo Colina death squad. All were accused of having perpetrated the Tarata bombing.\n\nShining Path leader Abimael Guzmán was arrested in September 1992 and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2014 he and his wife Elena Iparraguirre were tried for having ordered the Tarata bombing.\n\n"}

North was given a farm in Berlin, a gift that enabled him to marry Lucy Savage when he was only twenty-one years old; the couple would have five sons and three daughters. In 1795 the Norths purchased a sawmill located on the brook that ran beside their land. Simeon hired a man to help run it, enlarged the building to house a forge and trip-hammer, and began manufacturing scythes from imported steel. Four years later, he obtained a contract to make pistols and began to add a factory to the mill building.\nNorth's brother-in-law Elisha Cheney was skilled clockmaker, a trade he had learned from his father Benjamin and uncle Timothy Cheney, two of the finest clockmakers in Connecticut. In 1810, Elisha Cheney moved his clock-making shop to the next waterpower site upstream from North. Although Cheney was trained as a maker of fine clocks in brass and other materials, Eli Terry, a clockmaker who had trained as a clockmaker with either Timothy or Benjamin Cheney, had just invented a method of producing the parts for wooden shelf, or pillar-and-scroll clocks that enabled them to be mass-produced using interchangeable parts. Cheney used his new plant to mass-produce parts that manufacturers were turning out in emulation of Eli Terry's innovation. Cheney is known to have also produced screws and small metal parts in his mill for the pistols his brother-in-law was manufacturing just downstream.\n\nNorth is now generally credited with the invention of the milling machine, the first entirely new type of machine invented in America and one which, by replacing filing, made the production of interchangeable parts practicable.\n\nBy 1813, North had signed a government contract to produce 20,000 pistols that specified that parts of the lock had to be completely interchangeable between any of the 20,000 locks: the first contract of which any such evidence exists. It was during this period that North is believed to have invented a milling machine, which was able to shape metal mechanically and thus replaced filing by hand. Historian Diana Muir believes that he accomplished this around 1816. According to Muir's book \"Reflections in Bullough's Pond\", North \"was the first arms maker to implement a number of machine production techniques, yet he cautiously halted his pursuit of mass-produced, interchangeable parts\" whenever it became apparent that it was uneconomic. For some time, interchangeable-part manufacturing in metal would continue to be a combination of machine-made parts and human skill in filing machined parts to precise size for such high-end uses as military weapons, in which interchangeable parts were worth paying for at high prices (they were worth high prices because an army on campaign could cannibalize damaged weapons for parts).\n\nAs North's business grew, he moved it from Berlin to nearby Middletown.\n\nAt about that time, North was sent to Captain John H. Hall, superintendent of the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now in West Virginia), to introduce his methods of achieving interchangeability. In 1828, North received a contract to produce 5,000 Hall rifles with parts interchangeable with those produced at Harpers Ferry. North had a 53-year contractual relationship with the United States Department of War. The report of Charles H. Fitch prepared for the 1880 Census credits North with a key role in developing manufacture with interchangeable parts.\n\n"}

In 1784, Buell published \"A New and correct Map of the United States of North America Layd down from the latest Observations and best Authorities agreeable to the Peace of 1783\"; it was the first map of the new United States created by an American. He was also an inventor. He invented a lapidary machine to cut and polish gems, a minting machine that could product 120 coins per minute, and machines for planting onions and corn. He was the first man to design and cast type in the United States.\n\nAs a child, Abel Buell apprenticed with a goldsmith. By age 19, he was financially secure and married his girlfriend. In 1755, Buell was apprenticed, Madison, Connecticut to master silversmith and his future brother-in-law, Ebenezer Chittenden. Chittenden has the distinction of having produced more individual, surviving silver pieces, than any other silversmith in Connecticut.\n\nBuell gained notoriety at an early age as a counterfeiter by altering five-pound note engraving plates into larger denomination plates. His sentence was to be branded above the forehead under the scalp, loss of a portion of his right ear, and life in prison, plus forfeiture of all his lands and estates. Because of his youth, he served little time in prison and only the top part of his ear was cut off, but the authorities permitted it to be sewn back on. In 1765, Buell received a patent for a lapidary machine, making him the first Connecticut resident to receive a patent. After creating a ring on that machine, and presenting it to the prosecuting attorney, Buell's counterfeiting sentence was pardoned.\n\nIn 1770, Buell moved to New Haven, Connecticut and went to work for cartographer Bernard Romans. After the American Revolutionary War ended, Buell used the minting machine he had invented to mint the State of Connecticut's first official copper coins. Connecticut coppers were struck from 1785 to 1788 by Buell. Buell engraved the dies for the Connecticut copper coinage as well as the dies for the Fugio cents - America's first coinage. By 1784, Buell cast his own typeset and published the first American-made map of the United States. The wall map measured 43 × 48 inches, was printed in four sections, and hand-applied watercolor gave the map its color. In 1789, Buell went to England on behalf of a group of investors to steal the secrets of cotton manufacturing from the British and bring that knowledge back to America. While there, he gained both practical knowledge and a sum of money that allowed him, upon his return, to establish one of Connecticut's first cotton mills.\nIn later life, Buell joined with David Greenleaf to fashion some of the first steel swords manufactures specifically for the U.S. government. These swords were later used in the War of 1812 and were in service through the U.S. Civil War.\n\nSquandering or giving away all the money he earned, Buell died in 1822 at the New Haven Almshouse. Leaving little behind, he is known mostly because of the biography researched and written by Dr. Lawrence C. Wroth and a new biography by Christopher McDowell. However, the U.S. Library of Congress received a donation of this rare map, and on November 11, 2013 it mounted an exhibition displaying it both in the Thomas Jefferson Building, and on an online version. Called 'Mapping a New Nation: Abel Buell’s Map of the United States, 1784' the exhibition notes that it was the first map to be copyrighted in the United States.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1838621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1838621", "title": "Judiciary of Russia", "text": "Judiciary of Russia\n\nThe Judiciary of Russia interprets and applies the law of Russia. It is defined under the Constitution and law with a hierarchical structure with the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court at the apex. The district courts are the primary criminal trial courts, and the regional courts are the primary appellate courts. The judiciary is governed by the All-Russian Congress of Judges and its Council of Judges, and its management is aided by the Judicial Department of the Supreme Court, the Judicial Qualification Collegia, the Ministry of Justice, and the various courts' chairpersons. And although there are many officers of the court, including jurors, the Prosecutor General remains the most powerful component of the Russian judicial system.\n\nThe judiciary faces many problems and a widespread lack of confidence but has also made much progress in recent times. There have been serious violations of the accepted separation of powers doctrine, systematic attempts to undermine jury trials, problems with access to justice, problems with court infrastructure, financial support, and corruption. But the judiciary has also seen a fairer and more efficient administration, a strengthening of the rule of law, moves towards a more adversarial system, and increased utilization of the justice system under Putin.\n\nRussia has a trifurcated court system, with constitutional, ordinary (including military and non-military), and commercial courts. The Constitutional Court of Russia is considered a separate, independent court. Constitutional courts of federal subjects of Russia are separate and independent too (inter alia, independent from the federal Constitutional Court of Russia). The district courts are the primary criminal trial courts, and the regional courts are the primary appellate courts.\n\nThe ordinary courts are responsible for civil cases, administrative cases, criminal cases and cases of administrative offenses and have the following hierarchy:\n\n\nThe arbitration courts are responsible for relating to the economic disputes civil cases, administrative cases and cases of administrative offenses and have the following hierarchy:\n\n\nIn 1995, the courts sentenced about 1 million people for criminal offenses, and considered 3 million administrative offenses and 2.5 million civil cases.\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Russia () is responsible for cases concerning conformity with the Constitution, judicial disputes between 2 or more federal bodies, between a federal body and a member of the Federation, and between members of the Federation. As such, it practices \"constitutional review\" (as differentiated from judicial review) and decides whether federal laws, presidential decrees and directives, and local constitutions, charters, and laws comply with the federal constitution, as well as treaties between the national government and a regional governments and between regional governments.\n\nIt is composed of 19 judges, and may sit in plenary sessions but is otherwise divided into 2 chambers. The Constitutional Court consists of two chambers with 10 and 9 judges respectively. The Chairman presides over one of the chambers, the Deputy Chairman presides over the other chamber.\n\nConstitutionality of laws, disputes concerning competence of governmental agencies, impeachment of the President of Russia, and Constitutional Court's proposals of legislation must be dealt with by the plenary session. The Constitutional Court may also submit to the plenary session any other issue at its discretion.\n\nIn general, the court hears cases referred by the President, the Federation Council, the State Duma, one-fifth of the members of either chamber of the Federal Assembly, the Government, the Supreme Court, or other bodies of legislative or executive authority. It also hears complains by citizens of allegations of constitutional rights violations.\n\nConstitutional courts of Russia's federal subjects hear cases relating to conformity with regional constitutions of laws adopted by regional legislatures, and in this category of cases constitutional courts are courts of single instance.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Russia () is the highest court, and supervises inferior courts of general jurisdiction. It occasionally sits as a court of first instance in cases where important interests of state are at issue; in this case it normally consists of a judge and a jury, but occasionally consists of three judges.\n\nThere are 115 members of the Supreme Court. At plenary sessions the Supreme Court studies the judicial decisions of lower courts on various topics and adopts resolutions, which establish recommendations on the interpretation of particular provisions of law for lower courts for uniform application.\n\nThe Presidium of the Russian Supreme Court () represents Russia's final court of appeal. The Presidium consists of thirteen judges: the Chairman of the Supreme Court, its first deputy chairman, its six deputy chairmen and five other Supreme Court judges. Only the Prosecutor General has the right to appeal to the Presidium, and as a result, very few criminal cases reviewed by the three-judge panels of the Supreme Court make it to the Presidium. Only 0.4% of criminal cases in 1998 ended with an acquittal in the Presidium.\n\nThe court is divided into several chambers or collegia (), and each chamber normally sits with three judges:\n\n\nThere are several entities attached to the Supreme Court. The Academic Consultative Council () assists the court in various legal and academic matters and comprises members of the Supreme Court itself, academics, practicing lawyers, and law enforcement officers. The members of the Academic Consultative Council are elected at plenary sessions of the Supreme Court. The Judicial Department is responsible for administration of the courts.\n\nIn fact, after the merger of old Supreme Court and former Supreme Court of Arbitration the new Supreme Court of Russia leads 2 subsystems of Russian judicial system: ordinary courts and arbitration courts.\n\nOrdinary courts hear all criminal cases. Also ordinary courts hear administrative cases, civil cases, cases of administrative offenses with the exception of cases under the jurisdiction of arbitration courts. Ordinary courts are divided into 2 types: military and non-military (the courts of second type are also called \"ordinary courts\" in a narrow sense).\n\nCassation courts became operational on October 1, 2019. They carry out the cassation review of cases which were heard by district courts or garrison military courts as the courts of first instance.\n\nAppellate courts became operational on October 1, 2019. They carry out the appeal review of cases which were heard by regional courts or military courts of military districts/fleets as the courts of first instance.\n\nRegional courts (also called ' courts and city courts) are the courts at the regional level, though are not all named as such. This includes the supreme courts of the Republics of Russia, courts of the krais (territories; or ' courts), courts of the oblasts (regions; ), city courts of the federal cities of Russia (Moscow and Saint Petersburg), courts of the autonomous oblasts, and courts of the autonomous okrugs.\n\nThe courts sit as both courts of first instance and appellate courts. As courts of first instance, they hear more complex civil cases, serious criminal cases and administrative cases with participation of regional authorities. A judge and a jury, or alternatively 3 judges, hear these cases. As appellate courts, they hear decisions of district courts that have not yet entered into force, and consist of 3 judges.\n\nThe jurisdiction of military courts of military districts/fleets is similar to jurisdiction of regional courts, but military courts of military districts/fleets hear and review the cases relating to the military personnel only.\n\nDistrict courts ( or ; also called ' or ' courts), which were called People's Courts until 1996, are primarily courts of first instance but sometimes hear appeals from magistrate courts. They are formed in areas ( or \"\"), urban areas (), and cities (). Decisions of the court are appealed to the regional court.\n\nAs courts of first instance, they handle criminal cases where imprisonment is for more than 3 years, and consist of 1 judge and a jury where required. As courts of appeal from decisions of the magistrate courts consisting of 1 justice of the peace, they consist of 1 judge and retry the case.\n\nThe jurisdiction of garrison military courts is similar to jurisdiction of district courts, but the garrison military courts hear the cases relating to the military personnel only. Furthermore, unlike district courts, the garrison military courts do not carry out appeal procedure (because magistrate courts don't have jurisdiction over military personnel).\n\nMagistrate courts (; also called Justices of the Peace Courts) handle criminal cases where imprisonment is for less than three years such as petty hooliganism, public drunkenness, and serious traffic violations of a non-criminal nature, minor civil cases such as simple divorces, some property cases, disputes over land, and some labor cases, as well as some cases of administrative offenses and administrative cases. The magistrate courts were expected to hear two-thirds of all civil cases and close to 100,000 criminal cases. It consists of one magistrate or justice of the peace.\n\nArbitration courts (; also called \"arbitrazh\" or commercial courts) hear cases dealing with a wide matter of contractual issues, such as rights of ownership, contract changes, performance of obligations, loans, bank accounts, and insolvency (bankruptcy) of jurudical persons and natural persons. They operate independently of the other courts. The system of arbitration courts is supervised 30-Judge Economic Collegium that is part of an expanded Russian Supreme Court effective from August 8, 2014.\n\nArbitration county courts carry out the first cassation review of cases which were heard by arbitration courts of subjects of Russian Federation as the courts of first instance.\n\nThe Court of intellectual rights became operational on July 3, 2013. The Court of intellectual rights carries out the cassation review of cases relating to the copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets which were heard by arbitration courts of subjects of Russian Federation as the courts of first instance. Furthermore, the Court of intellectual rights hears some civil and administrative cases relating to the intellectual property issues as the court of first instance; such cases are heard by a panel of 3 judges of the Court of intellectual rights; appellate procedure is not provided for such cases; the first cassation review of such cases is carried out by the presidency of the Court of intellectual rights and the second - by the collegium on economic disputes of Supreme Court of Russia.\n\nArbitration appellate courts carry out the appeal review of cases which were heard by arbitration courts of subjects of Russian Federation as the courts of first instance.\n\nArbitration courts of subjects of Russian Federation hear the vast majority of cases under the jurisdiction of arbitration courts as the courts of first instance.\n\nPursuant to the 2002 Federal Law on Organs of the Judicial Community, which is the legal basis for the judicial organs of self-government, the All-Russian Congress of Judges is the supreme body of the judiciary. The Congress elects the members of the Council of Judges, the self-government body of the judiciary.\n\nThe Judicial Department of the Supreme Court of Russia is responsible for administration of the courts, such as selection and training of judicial candidates, working with law institutes, and qualifications of judges and other court officers. It is expected to enhance the independence of the judicial branch. It also supports the Council of Judges and the Supreme Qualifying Collegium.\n\nJudicial Qualification Collegia are bodies of judicial self-regulation that were established at the regional (Judicial Qualification Collegia) and national (Supreme Qualification Collegium) levels. They play a key role in the appointment, promotion and dismissal of judges.\n\nSome judges serve as a court chairperson. The court chairperson is solely responsible for the allocation of cases to judges, has considerable powers in the matters of appointment, and makes the initial recommendation for disciplinary measures, in particular dismissal.\n\nJudges are appointed by the Federation Council, and serve for life. Candidates are recommended by the Qualification Collegia / Supreme Qualification Collegium to the President, who in turn recommends candidates to the Federation Council.\n\nThe judges of the Constitutional Court are nominated by the President and appointed by the Federation Council for 12 years, and the judges must be at least 40 years old and must retire at 70 years old. The also must have served as a lawyer for at least 15 years and have a \"recognized high qualification\" (quotation from Constitutional Court Act) in law.\n\nThe Russian Minister of Justice is responsible for appointing judges to regional and city courts; however, in practice, many appointments below the national level still are made by the chief executives of subnational jurisdictions.\n\nJudges of the district courts are appointed by the President. A candidate must be at least 25 years old, is expected to have received a higher legal education (commonly a \"specialist degree\"), have at least 5 years of experience in the legal profession, and pass an examination from the Ministry of Justice. A candidate for a position of a judge of military court has to meet the same conditions as for a candidate for a position of a judge of non-military court. Initially, a candidate for a position of a judge of military court had to have a military rank of commissioned officer, because judges of military courts were military personnel (although not subordinated to any military authority); however, since 30 June, 2009, when the amendments, contained in Federal Constitutional Law of 29 June, 2009, №3-FKZ, entered into force, judges of military courts are no longer military personnel and candidates are no longer necessary to have military rank of commissioned officer.\n\nJustices of the peace are usually appointed by the regional legislature, but may also be elected. Justices of the peace require most of the same qualifications.\n\nThe Prosecutor General of Russia is the highest prosecutor in Russia, and both he and his office are independent from the executive, legislative and judicial branches of power. The Prosecutor General remains the most powerful component of the Russian judicial system.\n\nThe Prosecutor General is entrusted with:\n\n\nThe Prosecutor General is nominated by the President of Russia and appointed by the majority of Federation Council for a term of five years. If the nomination fails, the President must nominate another candidate within 30 days. The resignation of the Prosecutor General before the end of his term should be approved by both a majority of Federation Council and the President.\n\nThe Prosecutor General leads the General Prosecutor's Office of Russian Federation. The prosecutor's offices of subjects of Russian Federation are subordinate to the General Prosecutor's Office of Russian Federation, and the prosecutor's offices of cities and raions are subordinate to the prosecutor's offices of subjects of Russian Federation. There are specialized prosecutor's offices (environmental prosecutor's offices, penitentiary prosecutor's offices, transport prosecutor's offices, closed cities prosecutor's offices) which are subordinate to the General Prosecutor's Office of Russian Federation and have own subordinated prosecutor's offices. Finally, there is the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office of Russian Federation which is subordinate to the General Prosecutor's Office of Russian Federation and have own subordinated military prosecutor's offices (military prosecutor's office of Western Military District, military prosecutor's office of Eastern Military District, military prosecutor's office of Southern Military District, military prosecutor's office of Central Military District, military prosecutor's office of Northern Fleet, military prosecutor's office of Baltic Fleet, military prosecutor's office of Black Sea Fleet, military prosecutor's office of Pacific Fleet, military prosecutor's office of Strategic Missile Forces and Moscow city military prosecutor's office) which in turn have own subordinated military prosecutor's offices (garrison military prosecutor's offices).\n\nProsecutors in a broad sense are directly prosecutors (who leads prosecutor's offices), their deputies, senior assistants and junior assistants. All of them are federal government officials, have special ranks () and wear special uniform with shoulder marks. Military prosecutors (in a broad sense) are military personnel, have military ranks of commissioned officers and wear military uniform with shoulder marks but they are not subordinate to any military authority (excepting higher military prosecutor).\n\nRussian Criminal Procedure Code provides 2 formes of criminal investigation (): directly investigation () and initial inquiries (). In this connection, there are 2 categories of investigators (detectives): directly investigators () and persons conducting an initial inquiry (), in Russia. The both of these categories of law-enforcement personnel are not among operational personnel () which carry out the crime detection activity ().\n\nThere are 3 law-enforcement authorities where investigators () serve, in Russia:\n\n\nThe Investigative Committee, sometimes described as the \"Russian FBI\", is the main federal investigating authority in Russia, formed in place of the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor General in 2011.\n\nThe investigative departments of subjects of Russian Federation are subordinate to the Investigative Committee, and the investigative divisions of cities and raions are subordinate to the investigative departments of subjects of Russian Federation. There are specialized investigative departments (investigative departments on transport, investigative department of Baikonur Cosmodrome) which are subordinate to the Investigative Committee and have own subordinated investigative divisions. Finally, there is the Chief Military Investigative Department which is subordinate to the Investigative Committee and have own subordinated military investigative departments (military investigative department of Western Military District, military investigative department of Eastern Military District, military investigative department of Southern Military District, military investigative department of Central Military District, military investigative department of Northern Fleet, military investigative department of Baltic Fleet, military investigative department of Black Sea Fleet, military investigative department of Pacific Fleet, military investigative department of Strategic Missile Forces and Moscow city military investigative department) which in turn have own subordinated military investigative divisions (garrison military investigative divisions).\n\nInvestigators of the Investigative Committee in a broad sense are directly investigators, senior investigators, heads of investigative divisions and their deputies, heads of investigative departments and their deputies, Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Investigative Committee. All of them are federal government officials, have special ranks () and wear special uniform with shoulder marks. Military investigators (in a broad sense) are military personnel, have military ranks of commissioned officers and wear military uniform with shoulder marks but they are not subordinate to any military authority (excepting higher military investigator).\n\nThere are 5 law-enforcement authorities where persons conducting an initial inquiry () serve, in Russia:\n\n\nThe Russian legal profession is unregulated, but there have been moves towards unification and regulation recently. Anyone with a legal education (lawyer) can practice law, but only a member of the \" () may practice before a criminal court and Constitutional Court. Legal education has traditionally begun with the specialist degree in law (), but after Russia's accession to the Bologna process only bachelor of laws and master of laws degrees are available in Russian institutions of higher education. An \"advocate\" is an attorney (lawyer) who has demonstrated qualification and belongs to an organizational structure of advocates specified by law, known as being \"called to the bar\" in commonwealth countries.\n\nAn examination is administered by the qualifications commission of a court for admission to its \"\". To sit for the exam, one must have a higher legal education (commonly a specialist degree) and either two years of experience in legal work after graduation or a training program in a law firm after graduation. The exam is both written and oral, but the main test is oral. The written exam takes place in the form of computer testing and includes issues of the professional conduct of advocate and advocate's professional responsibility. After successfully passing of the written exam the candidates are allowed to take the oral exam. As part of the oral exam, the candidate must demonstrate his knowledge in various bodies of law and solve some mimic a real-life legal tasks. The candidate who does not pass the qualification exam can try to pass it again after 1 year only. The qualifications commission is composed of seven advocates, two judges, two representatives of the regional legislature, and two representatives of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nAfter successful passing the qualification exam a candidate should take the oath of advocate. From the moment of taking the oath, he becomes an advocate and a member of the advocate's chamber of the relevant federal subject of Russia. Advocate's chamber sends relevant information to the territorial subdivision of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, which includes the new advocate in the register of advocates of the relevant federal subject of Russia and issues to him an advocate's certificate, which is the only official document confirming the status of an advocate, on the basis of this information. The status of an advocate is granted for an indefinite period and is not limited by any age. There is only 1 advocate's chamber in each federal subject of Russia. Each advocate can be the member of only 1 advocate's chamber and can be listed in the register of advocates of the relevant federal subject of Russia only. In case of relocation to another region, the advocate ceases to be a member of the advocate's chamber and should be excluded from register of advocates at the old place of residence (advocate's certificate should be returned to the subdivision of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, which issued it), and after that he becomes a member of the advocate's chamber and is included in the register of advocates at the new place of residence (where he receive new advocate's certificate) without any exams. Each advocate can carry out his professional activity throughout Russia, regardless of membership in particular regional advocate's chamber and regardless of particular regional register where he is listed in. Advocates carry out their professional activity individually (advocate's cabinet) or as the member of advocate's juridical person (collegium of advocates, advocate's bureau). Advocate can open own cabinet after at least 3 years legal practice in collegium or bureau. An advocate, who has opened own cabinet, can not be the member of any advocate's juridical person, and an advocate, who is the member of one advocate's juridical person, can not be the member of any other advocate's juridical person. Advocate is obliged to report to advocate's chamber any changes in his membership in a collegium or a bureau and, equally, opening and closing a cabinet.\n\nAn advocate can not be an individual entrepreneur, government official, municipal official, notary, judge, elected official. An advocate can not work under an employment (labour) contract, with the exception of scientific and teaching activities. An advocate may combine his status with the status of a patent attorney, a trustee in bankruptcy. An advocate may be a shareholder/owner of business juridical persons and a member of voluntary associations and political parties. Russian advocate may have a status of advocate (attorney, barrister, solicitor) in foreign jurisdiction, subject to above conditions.\n\nAdvocate's chambers are professional associations of advocates, which are based on mandatory membership of advocates. All regional advocate's chambers are mandatory members of Federal Chamber of Advocates of Russian Federation, which is professional association at the federal level.\n\nIn 1988 there were 25,000 lawyers, and in 2002 there were 47,000 defense lawyers in all of Russia. As of 2018, there were 49,4 advocates per 100000 people in Russia.\n\nA juror must be 25 years old, legally competent, and without a criminal record.\n\nThe right to a jury trial is provided by Constitution of Russian Federation but for criminal cases only and in the procedure defined by law. Initially, the Criminal Procedure Code, which was adopted in 2001, provided that the right to a jury trial could be realized in criminal cases which should be heard by regional courts and military courts of military districts/fleets as the courts of first instance; the jury was composed of 12 jurors. In 2008, the anti-state criminal cases (treason, espionage, armed rebellion, sabotage, mass riot, creating an illegal paramilitary group, forcible seizure of power, terrorism) were removed from the jurisdiction of the jury trial. From 1 June 2018, defendants can claim a jury trial in criminal cases which are heard by district courts and garrison military courts as the courts of first instance; from that moment on, the jury is composed of 8 (in regional courts and military courts of military districts/fleets) or 6 (in district courts and garrison military courts) jurors.\n\nThe judiciary is primarily regulated by the Constitution of Russia, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1996 Federal Constitutional Law on the Judicial System of the Russian Federation. The Constitution states that the judicial branch is independent of the legislative and executive branches.\n\nThere is no usage of precedent, as used in common law legal systems. As such, the law on appeal may depend on the composition of the chamber deciding the appeal. A chamber normally consists of 3 judges, out of the dozens of judges within the court (19 in the Constitutional Court, 115 in the Supreme Court). Without the legal principle of \"stare decisis\", for each case a chamber may come to a different, even contradictory, conclusion, even compared to chambers within the same session. If they come to relatively consistent decisions, those in civil law legal systems call this \"jurisprudence constante\".\n\nEveryone has the right of legal assistance. The accused have the right to a defense lawyer from the time they are detained, put in custody, charged, or declared a suspect. According to the 2001 Code of Criminal Procedure, defense lawyers can participate in investigations with the consent of the prosecutor, meet privately with a client, collect evidence independently of the prosecutor, identify defense witnesses, present expert witnesses, be present for all court procedures, access to the prosecutions evidence after the investigation, and to file appeals regarding court procedures.\n\nFor serious and specific crimes, the accused have the option of a jury trial consisting of 12 jurors. The crimes that may be tried by a jury are murder, kidnapping, rape with aggravating circumstances, child trafficking, gangsterism, large-scale bribery, treason, terrorism, public calls for violent change in the constitutional system or for the seizure of power, and select other crimes against the state. The Constitution of Russia stipulates that, until the abolition of the death penalty, all defendants in a case that may result in a death sentence are entitled to a jury trial.\n\nJurors are selected by the prosecution and defense from a list of 30-40 eligible candidates. They are similar to common law juries, and unlike lay judges, in that they sit separately from the judges and decide questions of fact alone while the judge determines questions of law. They must return unanimous verdicts during the first 3 hours of deliberation, but may return majority verdicts after that, with 6 jurors being enough to acquit. They may also request that the judge show leniency in sentencing.\n\nThe \"arbitrazh\" courts have been singled out as particularly effective in dealing with business issues. Also, the number of people seeking assistance of the judicial system has increased from 1 million under Yeltsin to 6 million under Putin.\n\nHowever, Transparency International found that 78% of respondents reported they did not expect to find justice in the courts. Both public perception and comments from senior judges point to bribery as prevalent at the trial court level. Carnegie's Moscow Center states that judges only give out not-guilty verdicts once every seven years, and that those verdicts will be repealed.\n\nThere have been serious violations of the accepted separation of powers doctrine. Constitutional Court Judge and Council of Judges member Vladimir Yaroslavtsev, in a 2009 interview with the Spanish newspaper El País, claimed that the presidential executive office and security services had undermined judicial independence in Russia. Constitutional Court Judge Anatoly Kononov, who had frequently dissented from decisions taken by the majority of the court, in his interview to Sobesednik supported Yaroslavtsev, claiming that there was no independent judiciary in Russia.\n\nThere have been accusations of systematic attempts to undermine jury trials, including juror intimidation and bribery, and systematic trial delays. The number of jury trials remains small, at about 600 per year, out of about 1 million trials. Lawmakers are continuously chipping away at what types of criminal offenses merit a jury trial. Juries have granted acquittals in 15-20% of cases, compared with less than 1% in cases decided by judges. Juries may be dismissed and skeptical juries have been dismissed on the verge of verdicts, and acquittals are frequently overturned by higher courts.\n\nCompared to other industrialized nations, Russia has historically had a small number of lawyers in relation to its population. In 2002 there were 47,000 defense lawyers in all of Russia, while the courts sentenced about 1 million people for criminal offenses and considered 3 million administrative offenses and 2.5 million civil cases, and the Russian Census of 2002 put the resident population at more than 145 million people. For a comparison to the United States, the number of active lawyers practicing before the judiciary of California as of was more than 179,000, while the 2010 United States Census put the California population at more than 37 million people.\n\nThe court chairperson has sole discretion for allocation of court cases, and there is no systematic procedure for allocation based on objective criteria. There have been reports where the chairperson always assigns sensitive cases to particular judges or transfers cases to another judge during an ongoing trial.\n\nThere have been allegations of corruption concerning the oral exam required for admission to the \"\", known as being \"called to the bar\" in commonwealth countries.\n\nThe crucial question of contemporary Russian judiciary is the specialisation of judges and courts. One of the significant event on this topic was the International conference - First Siberian Legal Forum \"Specialisation of judges and courts: International experience and Russian perspective\", held in Tyumen city (October 17–18, 2014) and organised by Tyumen State University and Dmitry Maleshin\n\nTrial by jury was first introduced in the Russian Empire as a result of the Judicial reform of Alexander II in 1864, and abolished after the October Revolution in 1917. They were reintroduced in the Russian Federation in 1993, and extended to another 69 regions in 2003. Its reintroduction was opposed by the Prosecutor General. Magistrate courts were first created in 1864, abolished in 1917, and gradually reintroduced from 2001 to 2003.\n\nLay judges were in use in the Soviet Union. After a 1958 reform they were elected for 2 years at general meetings of colleagues at their place of work or residence, or at higher levels appointed by the soviet. The incidents of lay judges overruling professional judges was rare, and was officially reported in only 1 case by the late 1960s. Unlike the juries of the United States, lay judges were not selected from panels that are cross-sections of the entire population, but selected by institutions in each district.\n\nOn 25 May 2001, President Putin proposed the Federal Law \"On Amending the Federal Law On the Status of Judges In the Russian Federation\", which was passed by the Duma, and signed by President Putin on 15 December 2001. The law introduced disciplinary and administrative responsibility for judges. The Federal Law on Organs of the Judicial Community, which is the legal basis for the judicial organs of self-government, was passed in 2002.\n\nConstitutional Court Judge and Council of Judges member Vladimir Yaroslavtsev, in a 2009 interview with the Spanish newspaper El País, claimed that the presidential executive office and security services had undermined judicial independence in Russia. Constitutional Court Judge Anatoly Kononov, who had frequently dissented from decisions taken by the majority of the court, in his interview to Sobesednik supported Yaroslavtsev, claiming that there was no independent judiciary in Russia. In October the Constitutional Court in an unprecedented motion accused Yaroslavtsev of \"undermining the authority of the judiciary\" in violation of the judicial code, and Yaroslavtsev eventually resigned from the Council of Judges but remained a judge; Kononov resigned from the Constitutional Court on , seven years ahead of schedule.\n\nThe VIII All-Russian Congress of Judges met from .\n\n\n"}

First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging from environmental issues to marine pollution, human overpopulation, and global warming, to sustainable consumption and wildlife crime. World Environment Day has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and all celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.\n\nWorld Environment Day [WED] was established by the UN General Assembly in 1972 on the first day of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme \"Only One Earth\". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.\n\nFor almost five decades, World Environment Day has been raising awareness, supporting action, and driving changes for the environment. Here is a timeline of key accomplishments in WEDs’ history:\n\nThe theme for 2020 is \"Celebrate Biodiversity\", and will be hosted in Colombia in partnership with Germany. \n\nColombia is one of the largest “Megadiverse” nations in the world to hold  10% of the planet’s biodiversity. Since it is part of the Amazon rainforest,  Colombia ranks first in bird and orchid species diversity and second in plants, butterflies, freshwater fish, and amphibians.\nThe theme for 2019 is \"Beat Air pollution\". The host nation is China. This theme was chosen as it has been killing about 7 million people annually.\n\nIn Réunion Island, Miss Earth 2018 Nguyễn Phương Khánh from Vietnam delivered her speech during the World Environment Day with the theme \"How to fight global warming\".\n\nThe theme for 2018 was \"Beat Plastic Pollution\". The host nation was India. By choosing this theme, it is hoped that people may strive to change their everyday lives to reduce the heavy burden of plastic pollution. People should be free from the over-reliance on single-use or disposables, as they have severe environmental consequences. We should liberate our natural places, our wildlife and our own health from plastics. The Indian government pledged to eliminate all single use of plastic in India by 2022.\n\nThe theme for 2017 was 'Connecting People to Nature – in the city and on the land, from the poles to the equator'. The host nation was Canada.\n\nThe 2016 WED was organized under the theme \"Go wild for life\". This edition of the WED aims to reduce and prevent the illegal trade in wildlife. Angola was chosen as the host country of the 2016 WED during the COP21 in Paris.\n\nThe Slogan of the 2015 edition of the World Environment Day is \"Seven Billion Dreams. One Planet. Consume with Care\". The slogan was picked through a voting process on social media. In Saudi Arabia, 15 women recycled 2000 plastic bags to crochet a mural in support of the WED 2015. In India, Narendra Modi planted a Kadamb sapling to celebrate the World Environment Day and raise awareness for Environment. Italy is the host country of the 43rd edition of the WED. The celebrations took place as part of Milan Expo around the theme: Feeding the Planet - Energy for Life.\n\nThe Theme of the 2014 WED is : International Year of Small Islands Developing States (SIDS). By choosing this Theme the UN General Assembly aimed to highlight the development Challenges and successes of the SIDS. In 2014, the World Environment Day focused on global warming and its impact on ocean levels. The Slogan of the WED 2014 is \"Raise your voice not the sea level\", as Barbados hosted the global celebrations of the 42nd edition of the World Environment Day. The UN Environment Programme named actor Ian Somerhalder as the official Goodwill ambassador of the WED 2014.\n\nThe 2013 theme for World Environment Day was \"Think.Eat.Save.\"\n\nThe campaign addressed the huge annual wastage and losses in food, which, if conserved, would release a large quantity of food as well as reduce the overall carbon footprint. The campaign aimed to bring about awareness in countries with lifestyles resulting in food wastage. It also aimed to empower people to make informed choices about the food they eat so as to reduce the overall ecological impact due to the worldwide production of food. The host country for the year's celebrations was Mongolia.\n\nThe theme for the 2012 World Environment Day was \"Green Economy.\"\n\nThe theme aimed to invite people to examine their activities and lifestyle and see how the concept of a \"Green Economy\" fits into it. The host country for the year's celebrations was Brazil.\n\nThe world environment day of 2011 was hosted by India. It was the 1st time for India to host the day. The theme for 2011 was Forests—Nature At Your Service. Thousands of activities were organized worldwide, with beach clean-ups, concerts, exhibits, film festivals, community events, tree plantings and much more.\n\n'Many Species. One Planet. One Future', was the theme of 2010.\n\nIt celebrated the diversity of life on Earth as part of the 2010 International Year of Biodiversity. It was hosted in Rwanda. Thousands of activities were organized worldwide, with beach clean-ups, concerts, exhibits, film festivals, community events and much more. Each continent (except Antarctica) had a \"regional host city\", the U.N. chose Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as the host for all North.\n\nThe theme for WED 2009 was 'Your Planet Needs You – UNite to Combat Climate Change', and Michael Jackson's 'Earth Song' was declared 'World Environment Day Song'. It was hosted in Mexico.\n\nThe host for World Environment Day 2008 was New Zealand, with the main international celebrations scheduled for Wellington. The slogan for 2008 was \"CO, Kick the Habit! Towards a Low Carbon Economy.\" New Zealand was one of the first countries to pledge to achieve carbon-neutrality, and will also focus on forest management as a tool for reducing greenhouse gases.\n\nThe Chicago Botanic Garden served as the North American host for World Environment Day on 5 June 2008.\n\nThe topic for World Environment Day for 2007 was \"Melting Ice – a Hot Topic?\" During International Polar Year, WED 2007 focused on the effects that climate change is having on polar ecosystems and communities, on other ice- and snow-covered areas of the world, and the resulting global impacts.\n\nThe main international celebrations of the WED 2007 were held in the city of Tromsø, Norway, a city north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe topic for WED 2006 was Deserts and Desertification and the slogan was \"Don't desert drylands\".\n\nThe slogan emphasised the importance of protecting drylands.

Since the cartridge it was replacing was the .45-70 Government, the round was considered \"small-bore\" at the time. The design selected was ultimately the Krag–Jørgensen, formally adopted as the M1892 Springfield. It was also used in M1893 and later Gatling guns.\n\nThough the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps had adopted limited numbers of smokeless powder and bolt-action rifles, the .30-40 was the first cartridge adopted by the US Army that was designed from the outset for smokeless powder. After a brief experiment with a 230-grain bullet loading, the .30 Army loading was standardized in 1894 using a metal-jacketed round-nose bullet with of nitrocellulose powder. This loading developed a maximum velocity of in the barrel of the Krag rifle, and in the barrel of the Krag carbine.\n\nThe rimmed .30-40 round was also known as .30 Army, or .30 U.S. Although the .30-40 Krag was the first smokeless powder round adopted by the U.S. military, it retained the \"caliber-charge\" naming system of earlier black powder cartridges, i.e. a .30-caliber bullet propelled by of smokeless powder. The first use of a smokeless powder round by Winchester was a single shot in 30-40, and it was one of only three rounds for which the 1895 Winchester lever action, introduced in 1896, was chambered.\n\nFrom the outset, the .30-40 cartridge proved popular for hunting, and was chambered in a variety of firearms. In 1899, a Krag in .30-40 caliber was used to shoot the world-record Rocky Mountain elk. The record stood until the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nIn October 1899, after reviewing the experiences of the Spanish–American War, U.S. Army ordnance authorities developed a new loading for the .30 Army used in the Krag rifle, in an attempt to match the ballistics of the 7×57mm Mauser cartridge employed by Spanish forces in that conflict. The new loading increased the muzzle velocity in the rifle version of the Krag to at 45,000 psi. However, once the new loading was issued, reports of cracked locking lugs on service Krags began to surface. In March 1900 the remaining stocks of this ammunition (some 3.5 million rounds) were returned to the arsenals, broken down, and reloaded back to the original specification.\n\nIn 1903, after recommendations from the infantry Small Arms Board, the U.S. Army formally adopted a higher-velocity .30-caliber replacement for the .30-40 or .30 Army cartridge. The new cartridge was designated by its year of adoption, the .30-03.\n\n\n\n"}

It includes 22 described genera and at least 83 species. Members of this family can be distinguished from members of other families by the absence of claws on tarsi of leg I, tarsal segmentation 1-2-2-(2-4), pedipalps with pairs of lateroventral spines, and by males having an immovable flagellum on the mesal face of each chelicerum. The propeltidium of the Ammotrechidae is recurved.\n\nThe common names used for Ammotrechidae are curve-faced solifugids and sand runners. They live in arid regions, such as dune and rocky habitats. They are carnivores which feed mainly on other invertebrates. Ammotrechidae have relatively high metabolic rates, which allow them to be voracious predators. They feed by masticating their prey and sucking out the liquids. They are preyed upon by other vertebrates. Species of Ammotrechidae are found to be cannibalistic. Males and females dig shallow burrows for protection and nesting.\n\nThe species in North America are found in the South to Southwest and are rarely longer than 2 inches. Though they can be pests, they are considered beneficial because they feed on scorpions, spiders, and termites.\n\nThis family is subdivided in 5 subfamilies and 22 genera.\n\n"}
