It was established by Mirza Koochak Khan, a leader of the Constitutionalist movement of Gilan, and his \"Jangali\" (Jungle Movement) partisans, with the assistance of the Soviet Union's Red Army.\n\nThe Jungle movement that had started in 1914 was further boosted and gained gravity after the victory of the Bolsheviks in Russia. In May 1920 the Soviet Caspian Fleet led by Fedor Raskolnikov and accompanied by Sergo Orzhonikidze entered the Caspian port of Anzali. This mission was declared to be only in pursuit of the Russian vessels and ammunition taken to Anzali by the White Russian counter-revolutionary General Denikin, who had been given asylum by British forces in Anzali. The British garrison in Anzali was soon evacuated without any resistance and the British forces retreated to Manjil.\n\nFaced with the conflict between his movement and the united British and central government forces, the Iranian revolutionary Kuchik Khan considered several choices. Mirza had considered seeking support from Bolsheviks when a year before he traveled on foot to Lankaran to meet with them but by the time he arrived in that city, the Red forces had been forced to evacuate.\n\nAmongst the Jangalis, there were many who felt that the Bolsheviks offered a real solution to the problems shared by both Russia and Iran, namely the domination of the upper classes and the Imperial Court. Kuchik Khan's second-in-command, Ehsanollah Khan Dustdar, had become a communist and an ardent advocate of an alliance with the Bolsheviks. Kuchik Khan, though hesitant and cautious towards such an idea due to both his religious and nationalist background, accepted and the Jangalis entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks.\n\nThis cooperation with the Soviet revolutionaries was based on some conditions including the announcement of the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic under his leadership and lack of any direct intervention by the Soviets in the internal affairs of the republic. The Soviets agreed to support him with ammunition and soldiers. Mirza offered to pay for the ammunition but the Soviets refused any payments.\n\nIn May 1920, the Soviet Republic of Gilan, officially known as the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic, came into being. The Republic did not redistribute land to poor peasants which was considered as a conservative position by the more radical forces of the Jangal movement. Therefore, soon disagreements arose between Mirza and his group of advisors on one side and the Soviets and the Iranian Communist Party (evolved from the Baku-based Edalat (\"Justice\") Party) on the other.\nOn June 9, 1920 Mirza Kuchik Khan left Rasht in protest and also to avoid military confrontation (which he had always avoided as much as possible, even while fighting with the central government forces) and opened the way for the Communist (Edalat) party to set a coup d'état. The new administration, formally under Ehsanollah Khan but actually under the influence of Abukov (the Soviet Commissar) started a series of radical activities such as anti-religious propaganda, or forcing money out of the rich landlords.\n\nConservative elements characterized these measures as simply the latest features of longstanding Russian interference in the region, and the middle-class were antagonized by the level of violence, disrespect for property, and the Russian ties of the Jangali movement. The Republic also lost support from the general population due to the exceedingly high number of war refugees who began flooding the urban centers, thus posing a significant economic problem.\n\n\nMirza's efforts to resolve the bloody disputes by sending a petition through a delegate of two of his men to Soviet premier Vladimir Lenin did not result in a resolution. By 1921, and particularly after the agreement achieved between the Soviet Union and Britain, the Soviets decided not to further support the Soviet Republic of Gilan. The Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship (1921) was then signed, ensuring peaceful relations between the two countries and resulting in the withdrawal of Soviet forces.\n\nReza Khan Mirpanj, who had initiated a successful coup d'état with Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee several days beforehand, then began reasserting central government control over Gilan and Mazandaran. The Soviet Republic of Gilan officially came to an end in September 1921. Mirza and his German friend Gauook (\"Hooshang\") fled alone into the Alborz Mountains, and died of frostbite. It is said that his body was decapitated by a local landlord and his head was displayed in Rasht to establish the government's new hegemony over revolution and revolutionary ideas.\n\nHistorians have tried to analyze the factors that contributed to the demise of the Jangal movement. Some of the main studies including those by Gregor Yeghikian and Ebrahim Fakhrayi (Minister of Culture in Kuchik Khan's Cabinet of the Soviet Republic) suggest a role for both extremist actions taken by the Communist (Edalat) Party that provoked opposing religious sentiment among the public, and Mirza Kuchik Khan's religious and at times somewhat conservative views on collaboration with the Communist Party as possible factors.\n\nIt has been suggested also that the change of policy on the Soviet side regarding pursuing global revolution (as advocated by Trotsky) versus establishing and protecting the Soviet Union was the main reason for them to withdraw support from the Gilan Republic. The second option got more support and therefore Soviets signed the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement with the British in London (1921) which required them to retreat from Northern Iran. Correspondence between Theodore Rothstein, the Soviet ambassador in Tehran, and Mirza Koochak Khan clearly supports this view. As part of his peace making efforts, Rothstein had also sent a message to the Soviet officers among Ehsanollah Khan's one thousand strong force that had made its way towards Qazvin, not to obey his orders and as a result that campaign was defeated.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074190", "title": "Hyphy", "text": "Hyphy\n\nThe term hyphy ( ) is Oakland slang meaning \"hyperactive\". More specifically, it is an adjective describing the hip hop music and the culture associated with the area. The term was first coined by Oakland rapper Keak da Sneak.\n\nThe hyphy culture emerged in the late 1990s in Oakland before rising to prominence throughout the wider Bay Area in the early 2000s. It is distinguished by gritty, pounding rhythms, and has been compared to crunk music. An individual is said to \"get hyphy\" when they dance in an overstated, fast-paced and ridiculous manner, or if they get overloud with other people. The phrase \"\"to get hyphy\"\" is similar to the southern phrase \"\"to get crunk\"\". Those who consider themselves part of the hyphy movement strive for this behavior.\n\nAlthough the \"Hyphy Movement\" briefly saw light in mainstream America, it has been an established subculture in the Bay Area since the early 1990s. Throughout the Bay Area (particularly in East Oakland), there are events regularly hosted called \"sideshows\", where people perform or watch illegal automobile performances. These performances include activities such as donuts, ghost-riding, an action that has proven fatal on multiple occasions, and street racing, while others dance and \"go dumb\" around them. The Hyphy Movement's resurgence in early 2006 was cited by prominent Bay Area rapper E-40 as a new opportunity for the Bay Area's unique sound to reach a nationwide audience.\n\nFor many Bay Area natives, rapper Mac Dre is cited as the individual who spearheaded the general audience's interest in Hyphy music after his sudden death in 2004. Mac Dre's Treal TV DVD special represented everything Hyphy, from what goes on at the sideshows to street slang, and common dances like “going dumb” and the “thizzle dance” became popular moves created by Mac Dre. Many artists, such as Drake and DJ Mustard, pay homage to Mac Dre due to his huge influence in their musical career. With the start of Mac Dre's label, Thizz Entertainment, he was able to shine a light on local talent such as E-40 and Andre Nickatina, prominent members of the Bay Area rap scene.\n\nIn the early to mid-2010s, the genre of hyphy music saw a resurgence in the mainstream as a part of being a stylistic influence to an up tempo and club oriented type of mainstream hip hop known as \"ratchet music,\" which was popularized by various Los Angeles producers, including DJ Mustard. The production style of DJ Mustard is adapted from hyphy music and played a role in bringing West Coast hip hop back to national attention. DJ Mustard has been attached in producing for popular artists' singles, which include: Tyga's, \"Rack City,\" 2 Chainz's \"I'm Different,\" Young Jeezy's \"R.I.P.,\" B.o.B's \"HeadBand,\" YG's \"My Nigga\" and \"Who Do You Love?\" (as well as the majority of his 2014 debut album \"My Krazy Life\"), Ty Dolla Sign's \"Paranoid,\" Kid Ink's \"Show Me,\" Trey Songz's \"Na Na,\" Omarion's \"Post to Be,\" and Big Sean's \"I Don't Fuck With You,\" among others.\n\nAmong the local, more peripheral acts that achieved success outside of the Bay Area include Lil B, a member of the Berkeley rap group The Pack that has built a strong cult following on the Internet; the Richmond-based hip hop collective HBK Gang with individual members Iamsu!, Kehlani, Sage the Gemini, and P-Lo making their marks in the mainstream ; Oakland-born pop rapper G-Eazy, who has gained two Billboard Top-10 hits with \"Me, Myself & I\" and \"No Limit\" (the latter featuring ASAP Rocky and Cardi B); and the Vallejo-based quartet SOB x RBE, who found mainstream attention after being featured on the track \"Paramedic!\" in the Kendrick Lamar- for the 2018 superhero film Black Panther.\n\nIn November 2011, Canadian hip hop artist Drake released the song \"The Motto,\" featuring Young Money labelmate Lil Wayne, as the fourth single for his sophomore album Take Care. The song's instrumental (produced by T-Minus) takes major influence from hyphy music, and was a commercial success in the US—having sold 3,113,000 copies in the US as of April 2013—due to the meteoric popularity of the catchphrase YOLO during that time. It peaked atop both the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and US Rap Songs charts, and was ranked 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Year-end Chart. \"The Motto\" was also nominated for Best Rap Song at the 55th Grammy Awards. A music video was released on February 10, 2012 and features cameos from Bay Area rappers E-40 and Mistah F.A.B. as well as including an introduction from the mother of Mac Dre, Wanda Salvatto. Salvatto has also said, in a 2016 interview with Complex Media, that Drake told her how Mac Dre influenced him when he was 15 years old, and how important that was to him.\n\nDJ Mustard's popularity around the same time began another movement that stemmed from the Bay Area, known as R&Bass. Coined by producer J Maine, this movement has gained widespread popularity, specifically on the Internet. R&Bass blends hyphy music with contemporary R&B, thus garnering crossover appeal. Artists like Jonn Hart, Rayven Justice, and producers like Christopher Dotson embrace the R&Bass style. As well, through this movement, there have been numerous collaborations with various hyphy artists, including E-40.\n\nAs a result of the recognizably and commonality between many of DJ Mustard's chart-topping singles, a number of artists who employ production similar to his have been criticized for unoriginality and sometimes plagiarism, with some of the biggest offenders of this style rip-off including the 2014 chart-topping Iggy Azalea single, \"Fancy\" and \"Classic Man,\" the 2015 debut single by rapper Jidenna which samples \"Fancy\". However, the popularity of Mustard's style started to gain influence outside of hip hop. In 2012, electronic dance music (EDM), which incorporated elements of southern trap music, began gaining popularity and brought wider attention to the derivative forms of trap, including hyphy, as well as Jamaican Dancehall music. This so-called \"EDM Trap\" genre saw the use of techno, dub, and house sounds combined with the Roland TR-808 drum samples and vocal samples typical of trap.\n\nIn December 2013, French producer DJ Snake and American rapper Lil Jon released the single \"Turn Down for What\", which became both a commercial hit charting in several countries and a viral hit throughout 2014. The composition of the song borrows elements from crunk and hyphy songs, and \"Rolling Stone\" voted \"Turn Down For What\" as the second best song of 2014, saying that, \"The year's nutsiest party jam was also the perfect protest banger for a generation fed up with everything. DJ Snake brings the synapse-rattling EDM and Southern trap music; Lil Jon brings the dragon-fire holler for a hilarious, glorious, glowstick-punk fuck you.\"\n\nThe success of \"Turn Down for What\" set the standard for Trap EDM and even Pop music in the mid-2010s, which kept the influence and legacy of hyphy music alive. Among those songs include the DJ Snake and Major Lazer collaboration \"Lean On,\" the Skrillex-produced Justin Bieber single \"Sorry,\" and the chart-topping 2016 song \"Closer\" by American DJ duo The Chainsmokers.\n\n"}

His love for jazz and jazz / rock led to numerous projects and collaborations with Mircea Tiberian, Marius Popp, Dan Mandrila, Johnny Răducanu, Cătălin Târcolea, Dragoş Nedelcu, Mircea Florian, Nicu Alifantis, Sergiu Cioiu. He has a prestigious activity in avant-garde contemporary music, performing alongside Iancu Dumitrescu / Hyperion Ensemble and participating in the works of other composers such as Vlad Ulpiu, Mihaela Vozganian, Horia Surianu, as well as his personal projects.\n\nIn parallel, he has worked in the field of architecture for a long time with a successful career in Bucharest, Paris, and Beirut. During all this time he never abandoned his early love for graphics and drawing.\n\nHe is one of the grandchildren of the painter Costin Petrescu.\n\nFrom a very young age, Costin Petrescu showed interest in artistic areas. He took piano lessons early in his life but unfortunately the family instrument had to be sold in order to cover the high cost of living created by the crisis of the '50s after the second world war and the establishment of communism in Romania. However Costin, encouraged by his nanny, immediately substitute the loss of the piano with playing wooden spoons and the various family gastronomic vessels.\n\nBy the time he turned five, Costin caught the attention of the renowned drummer and musician Sergiu Malagamba, a friend of the family, who predicted a great future in music for the little boy. His mother, member of a well known choir in Bucharest, never stopped to inspire and encouraged him. His music teacher from high school also recognised the talent and supported the purchase of a real set of drums. Soon after, Costin joined the 60s rock group The Pioneers.\n\nIn 1964, the year of the Tokyo Olympics, The Pioneers became Olympic'64 and the new band quickly established itself with the music fans due to numerous engagements in clubs, concert halls and the Romanian Television. By now Costin greatly developed his drumming capabilities and together with the guitarist Picky Inglessis and his childhood friend Dorin Liviu Zaharia, nicknamed Chubby due to his style that resembled Chubby Checker, they started to write original music. The two rock operas that came out of this collaboration, the Dodecameron of the White Fire and Karma Kaliyuga made history at the Pop-Rock Music Festival organised by the Faculty of Architecture in Bucharest. The communist officials were not impressed with that kind of theatrics and the festival was banned for many years.\n\nMeanwhile, Costin attended the Faculty of Architecture Ion Mincu. As he entered the 4th year of studies the band called it quits, but Costin immediately joined another established rock group, Phoenix from Timișoara.\n\nWith Phoenix, Costin climbed up the pop-rock ladder. The hard work was rewarded by sold-out concerts in Romania and abroad. Three vinyl records, of which two LPs and one Single were produced during this period and the band was invited at music festivals in Bratislava (Czech Republic) and Sopot (Poland). The band is now notorious in Romania but Costin wants something else and he begins a love affair with jazz and other musical forms, listening to Weather Report, Blood Sweet and Tears, Frank Zappa, Miles Davis, John Coltrane or Sun Ra.\n\nAt the Bucharest university, Costin had the chance to study the great Le Corbusier, to which he attached himself as a \"fan\" and a disciple. He travels frequently to Timișoara but the distance between the two cities is somewhat diminished by the tenacity with which he balances the two primordial arts needed in order to express himself.\n\nPhoenix is working now on their fourth album, a double one titled Cantafabule, but due to incompatibilities with the leader of the group, Nicolae Covaci, Costin leaves the band during the recordings. This time he moves towards jazz, jazz-rock and ethno-jazz music, performing concerts and recording with top personalities from this area of music: Mircea Tiberian, Marius Popp and Dragoş Nedelcu, pianists, Dan Mandrila saxophonist, Johnny Răducanu double bass, Cătălin Tarcolea flute. He also participates to the recordings and concerts of Mircea Florian, Nicu Alifantis, folk-singers and composers, and the singer and actor Sergiu Cioiu, integrating his participation in various and diverse musical fields.\n\nAfter obtaining the degree in architecture in 1974, Costin follows for six months the Artillery Reserve Officers' School in Braila and then works at Buftea Cinemas Studios as a stage designer. At the end of 1977 he is employed as an architect at a design institute in Bucharest where he remains for many years working on industrial and housing projects.\n\nDuring this period Costin is co-opted as a percussionist by the composer Iancu Dumitrescu, the founder of the contemporary music group Hyperion. Their repertoire consisted of old Romanian music picked and transposed by Anton Pann, Domitian Vlah, Dimitrie Cantemir, Ioan Căianu, Ieromonahul Vlahu, Filotei but also of the music of some Romanian modern composers considered interesting in Europe at that time, including Iancu Dumitrescu, Aurel Stroe, Stefan Niculescu, Corneliu Cezar, Octavian Nemescu, Costin Cazaban, Horia Surianu etc.\n\nCostin continues to expand his musical taste by listening continuously to Messiaen, Schöenberg, Stockhausen, Alban Berg, Steve Reich, John Cage, Xenakis (an architect of Romanian-Greek origin), Pierre Schaeffer and others. From this moment, Costin enters the world of the so-called \"avant-garde music\", falls in love with the new and vast universal sound and begins to build his own arsenal of percussion instruments needed to reproduce the vibrations inside his head.\n\nHyperion is touring extensively not only in Romania but in other parts of Europe as well: Italy, Austria, Germany, France, Portugal.\n\nAt the end of another tour with Hyperion, Costin decides not to return to the homeland. To escape the serious deterioration of the social, economic and political situation in Romania, Costin, with the help of a good, old friend, Mihai Munteanu, an architect himself, settles in Paris. His wife and daughter join him in about two years, but not without difficulty.\n\nIn Paris the attempts to resume the musical activity failed and at the advice of the great musician Michel Berger and his wife France Gall, whom he had already met, Costin returns to architecture. And it works great!\n\nWith patience and work, in only three years, he becomes project manager at one of France's most prestigious architectural agencies, the \"Jean Jaques Ory\" cabinet. There are many spectacular and interesting large and medium-sized works in Paris and the surroundings, culminating with \"Washington Plaza\" a huge restructuring project of the business centre of the same name.\n\nThe so-called \"Romanian Revolution\" of December 1989, finds Costin in Paris with his architect colleagues. He organised immediately with a few friends from the diaspora an association called CRED (Consensus pour la Roumanie Européene et Démocratique) with the idea to help Romania at that precise moment. In addition, he managed to reform Phoenix for an one off concert in the free world at \"La Cigale\" in Paris,\n\nFor several years, Costin worked at two other important Parisian architectural agencies after which he created his own firm, La Strada.\n\nSoon he had the opportunity to work for two years in Beirut, Lebanon, leading a design team to build the student dormitories in the new Hadath University Campus.\n\nIn 1997, Costin opened in Bucharest \"Magic Sign\", a company that imported from France construction and architecture technology. It was a success and there were serious years of work and development. Unfortunately the post-communist era and the Romanian overall system created a lot of problems.\nDuring this period he collaborated sporadically with old musicians friends, mainly Mircea Florian and Mircea Baniciu.\nIn 2015 Costin abandoned the business altogether to devote himself completely to his love of music and design. He draws in pen and pencil graphics, visits the most interesting and sophisticated exhibitions in Paris, travels often to Bucharest and spends hours composing, assisted by the computer and using electronic percussion instruments as well as real and virtual tools.\nIn 2018 he wrote the book \"Between Phoenix and ... Le Corbusier\", a dialogue with the prominent Romanian rock historian Nelu Stratone.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the central district of Bangkok, including Rattanakosin Island. Neighboring districts are, from the north, clockwise: Dusit, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Samphanthawong, and across the Chao Phraya River, Thon Buri, Bangkok Yai, Bangkok Noi, and Bang Phlat.\nThe district is bounded by the Chao Phraya River to the west, Khlong Phadung Krung Kasem in the north, and Ratchadamnoen Road and Khlong Ong Ang to the east. The center of Bangkok, marked by the city pillar shrine (\"lak mueang\"), is in the district. Also surrounding the large open space of the \"Sanam Luang\" are the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew, the National Museum in the former palace of the Vice King, and the main campus of Thammasat University as well as Silpakorn University.\n\nOther significant landmarks in the district include Wat Pho, the Giant Swing, Wat Suthat, Wat Ratchanadda (with Loha Prasat), and the Democracy Monument. Also the well-known Khaosan Road is in the district. Another significant temple is Wat Bowonniwet, where several Thai kings were ordained as monks.\n\nOf the original 14 forts protecting Bangkok only two survive. Fort Phra Sumen in the northern corner of the district, and Fort Mahakan in the east. Since 2000 a small park named \"Santichaiphrakarn\" around Fort Phra Sumen was built.\nIn 2005 the riverfront of the Phra Nakhon District, from King Rama I Bridge (Memorial Bridge) in the south to the Wasukri Pier (Dusit District), was submitted to the UNESCO for consideration as a future world heritage site.\n\nAnother landmark is Sala Chalermkrung Royal Theatre on Charoen Krung Road. It is Bangkok's oldest cinema and was the first air conditioned theater in Thailand. Built at the order of King Prajadhipok and named by him, it opened on 2 July 1933. It is the only theater from the first \"golden age\" of Thai cinema still standing. No longer regularly showing movies, the theater has been renovated and is principally used for Thai dance performances. Another point of interest is the Pak Khlong Talat flower market. Tha Phra Chan is a well-known Thai amulets market.\n\nThe area around Phahurat Road (พาหุรัด) can be considered Thailand's \"Little India\". The road was constructed during King Chulalongkorn's reign over a century ago and Indian community started to form after that. Siri Guru Singh Sabha, Thailand's first Sikh temple was built in 1933 near the road. The area is well known for Indian fabric shops and Indian cuisine.\n\nPhra Nakhon was once an amphoe (district) named Chana Songkhram (อำเภอชนะสงคราม). The administration was overhauled on 15 October 1915 when 25 new districts were created for inner Bangkok. On 12 March 1928, six of these districts: Phahurat, Samran Rat, Phra Ratchawang, Chana Songkhram, Sam Yot, and Bang Khun Phrom were merged to form Amphoe Phra Nakhon. It became Khet (district) Phra Nakhon in 1972.\n\nSongkran, the traditional Thai New Year festival, is celebrated throughout the country from 13–15 April of each year. Khaosan Road (or Khao Sarn Road) in Phra Nakhon District is one notable place to celebrate the event where lots of people, both locals and tourists, come and splash water.\n\nDuring another famous festival, Loy Krathong, on the 15th day of the 12th lunar month, the Chao Phraya River bank in the district, with numerous piers and Phra Sumen Fort, is a popular place to float lanterns on the water.\n\nRatchadamnoen Avenue is often heavily decorated with lights around the king's birthday (28 July), the queen mother's birthday (12 August), National Day (5 December) and other major anniversaries. Sanam Luang and recently created Lan Plabpla Maha Chedsada Bodin (ลานพลับพลามหาเจษฎาบดินทร์) in front of Wat Ratchanadda and its Loha Prasat are open spaces that frequently used to celebrate events.\n\nThe district is divided into 12 sub-districts (\"khwaeng\").\n"}

Winwood remained with the group to produce the follow-up album \"Propaganda\" later in 1974.\n\nThe album's title is a line from the song on the album \"Hasta Manana Monsieur\", and a pun on the title of the song \"Come On-a My House\", made famous by Rosemary Clooney. The pun has a precedent, however, in the title of the track \"Kimona My House\" on jazz guitarist Dick Garcia's 1956 album \"A Message from Garcia\".\n\nMusically, \"Kimono My House\" represented a shift in sound and a focusing of Ron Mael's songwriting (now the indisputable lead songwriter). Sparks' two albums with the Mankey brothers had been diverse albums that featured a number of different styles, such as a cover of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"Here Comes Bob\", which was performed by a small string section, and \"The Louvre\", which mixed both English and French lyrics.\n\nThe new album embraced the more pop-oriented side of the Mael brothers' song-writing, which had previously been evident in songs such as \"Wonder Girl\" and \"High C\". Now, with challenging arrangements by the new British line-up and Winwood's simpler production, the songs were more focused. The album slotted in with the current popularity of glam rock—which was dominating the charts—in particular, the more experimental and electronic sound of Roxy Music and David Bowie. Lyrically, the songs remained unusual and humorous. The great number of words filled with pop-culture references, puns and peculiar sexual content sung often in falsetto by Russell Mael set Sparks apart from other groups.\n\nThe particularity of their sound, which matched pop songwriting with complex lyrics, defined the group to their UK audience. Integral to the sound was Adrian Fisher's guitar playing and Martin Gordon's sonorous Rickenbacker bass. This was aided and abetted by the physical presence of the group. Ron and Russell milked their peculiar image: Ron's toothbrush moustache, reserved wardrobe and usually silent demeanour sat in diametrical opposition to his younger brother's long curly hair and energetic and flamboyant stage persona. Taken together, the sound and look of the group caused a sensation, producing what seemed to the mass audience to be an \"overnight success.\"\n\nWhat sounds like a honking saxophone line at the end of ”Equator”, is in fact a mellotron played by Ron Mael; the seductive whispers on the track are delivered by a sped-up Russell Mael.\n\nThe front cover is notable for having neither the name of the band nor the album title on it. The two girls pictured, in kimonos, were members of a Japanese dance company touring England in 1974.\n\nIn 1980 Michi Hirota (the girl on the right, with the fan) would add vocals to David Bowie's \"It's No Game\".\n\nThe back cover includes the band name, the album title, list of songs and photos of the band members. The inner sleeve for the original vinyl record was printed with a full set of song lyrics on one side and a black and white photograph of the Mael brothers, framed in a spotlight, on the reverse.\n\n\"Kimono My House\" became a popular release, reaching #4 on the UK Albums Chart, and was awarded gold status by the BPI in September 1974. The single \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\" was a surprise hit and reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart, being certified as silver in June 1974. It was held off the top spot by The Rubettes' bubblegum pop song \"Sugar Baby Love\", which remained at #1 for four weeks. Sparks' second Island era single, \"Amateur Hour\", reached the top ten in the UK later that summer.\n\nOutside the UK, \"Kimono My House\" and its singles made a significant impact across Europe, notably in Germany, where both singles reached #12. In the US, the album reached #101 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The group's two Bearsville Records albums had garnered critical praise but few sales. The only significant chart performance had been for \"Wonder Girl\", which had been a minor regional hit and had crept into the lower reaches of the Cashbox chart at #92. In place of \"Amateur Hour\", \"Talent is an Asset\" was selected as the album's second single in the US, and the album's third in New Zealand.\n\nUK singer and Smiths frontman Morrissey has frequently cited \"Kimono My House\" as one of his favorite albums and famously wrote a letter to the NME, at the age of 15, extolling its virtues. He later told the Mael brothers that it had been a key influence on him deciding to embark upon a music career. In 2010, Morrissey included it in a list of his 13 favorite albums of all-time for \"The Quietus\". Björk has also named the album as one of her all-time favourites. Steve Jones, guitarist and composer of the Sex Pistols, also hailed the album saying: In 1974, \"The first Be-Bop Deluxe album, \"Axe Victim\" and Sparks' \"Kimono My House\" were both big albums for me and Cookie [Paul Cook]. We'd sit in his bedroom for hours listening to them\". John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers named Adrian Fisher's guitar playing on \"Kimono My House\" and its follow-up \"Propaganda\" as one of his influences for the album \"By the Way\". The album and was featured in Robert Dimery's book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\"..\n\n\"Kimono My House\" was remastered and re-issued by Island in 1994 and 2006. The first issue by the Island Masters subsidiary added the non-album B-sides \"Barbecutie\" and \"Lost and Found\". The '21st Century Edition' added a live recording of \"Amateur Hour\" recorded by a subsequent (1975) line-up of the group and sleeve notes by Paul Lester, the deputy editor of \"Uncut\".\nA remastered \"40th Anniversary Edition\" was released on 15 December 2014 on vinyl only, including previously unreleased demo material from the band's archives. Coinciding with the release the entire album was performed, along with the 35-piece Heritage Orchestra, at the Barbican Centre on 19 and 20 December, where the band also performed brand new orchestral arrangements by Nathan Kelly. The programme also featured songs from their other 22 albums. The second date was added after the first night sold out.\n\nAs part of the live performance with the Heritage Orchestra, the band released the song \"Thank God It’s Not Christmas\" as a single. Stewart Mason of AllMusicsaid:\n\n“One of the many highlights on the phenomenal \"Kimono My House\", \"Thank God It’s Not Christmas\" is the archetypal song from Sparks’ Island Records era. Adrian Fisher’s lead guitar and Ron Mael’s piano duel insistently with a prominent string section, as Russell Mael sings an alternately wry and depressing lyric about the desire to find activities that distract oneself from a slowly disintegrating relationship. The lyrics are truly magnificent, both in their literal meaning and the way they work with the music, creating a rhythmic counter-melody that echoes Fisher’s guitar line, and Muff Winwood’s crystal-clear production emphasizes the song’s soaring, anthemic elements; although \"Amateur Hour\" and \"This Town Ain’t Big Enough for Both of Us\" were the hits and \"Here In Heaven\" is more beloved by fans, \"Thank God It’s Not Christmas\" is possibly the album’s highest point.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074258", "title": "Gilles Groulx", "text": "Gilles Groulx\n\nGilles Groulx (May 30, 1931 in Montreal, Quebec – August 22, 1994) was a Canadian film director. He grew up in a working-class family with 14 children. After studying business in school, he went to work in an office but found the white-collar environment too stultifying. Deciding that the only way out was to become an intellectual, he attended the for a time and was a supporter of Borduas' automatiste movement. He also made 8 mm amateur films, which landed him a job as picture editor in the news department of the CBC. After three short personal films that confirmed his talent, he was hired by the National Film Board (NFB) at what was the beginning of the candid eye movement in 1956.\n\nHis first film with the NFB was \"Les Raquetteurs\" (1958). Co-directed with Michel Brault, and including the important contribution of sound recordist it surpassed the candid eye approach, establishing for the first time in film history, the filmmakers in the midst of the ongoing event. Seeking a truthful relation to the captured film reality, sound is also captured live. The film, not devoid of comical aspects, is also seen as an important step in anthropological cinematography. It captures without judgement, a social phenomenon that would have seemed unimportant in its archaism and triviality (a snowshoe convention on asphalt!), thus revealing with documented distanciation elements of popular Quebec culture that were previously disdained.\n\nIn 1961, Groulx's focus shifted from the crowd to the individual, with his short documentary, \"Golden Gloves\".\n\n\"Voir Miami\" (1962) revealed Groulx's poetic side. Although it presents an indictment of contemporary America, it does so in a poetic, almost lyrical style.\n\nIn 1964, Groulx turned to a highly social and political type of filmmaking, which would be characteristic of his work to the very end. \"The Cat in the Bag (Le Chat dans le sac)\", his first feature-length drama, is about coming of age: for the protagonists as they face difficult political choices, and possibly for the Quebec people as well. Not only did Groulx write and direct the film, he also did his own editing (as he would for all subsequent films). In his dramas, Groulx liked to film non-professionals who were the real characters in the story or who were very similar to them and could improvise within a given situation.\n\nBefore undertaking another feature, Groulx made the documentary short \"Un jeu si simple\" (1965), a dramatic look at the sport of hockey in the province of Quebec, and in particular, the Montreal Canadiens teams of 1950-1960.\n\nThis was followed in 1967 by the film \"\", a complex collage of images reflecting the daily lives of Quebeckers. Groulx questions their choice of lifestyle through an unconventional filmic language giving unprecedented importance to sound. Barraging the spectators with a disturbing mix of chanting voices, songs, quotations and advertisements from the mass media, the film is a protest against the consumer society, a denunciation of the dehumanizing mechanisms created and used by man against man.\n\nContinuing in this pamphleteering vein, Groulx made \"24 heures ou plus\", a veritable call to revolution, which was censored by the NFB. Shot at the end of 1971, the film was not officially released until 1977.\n\nIn 1977, he directed the feature-length documentary \"Première question sur le bonheur\", a Mexico-Canada co-production in which Groulx again questions the exploitation of man by man, but this time in the context of rural Mexico.\n\nIn 1980, Groulx was involved in a serious automobile accident that put an end to his career, although he did manage to come back in 1982 and complete the feature film he had been working on. \"Au Pays de Zom\" is a scathingly funny satire on the businessman ethos in the unexpected form of a musical, in which Joseph Rouleau, an opera singer greatly admired by Groulx, plays the role not of a romantic hero but of a financier.\n\nGroulx's films are the work of a worried man perpetually questioning life and the world around him. Through them, he explored different aspects of Quebec society, always varying his style to suit the subject. He was one of the first Quebec filmmakers to make auteur films, both documentary and drama. Overall, it could be said that his films convey a Marxist philosophy with a Brechtian aesthetic.\n\n\"The Cat in the Bag (Le Chat dans le sac)\" (1964) remains his best known film and played a seminal role in the development of Quebec cinema. In 1985, the Government of Quebec presented Groulx with the Prix Albert-Tessier for lifetime achievement.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074273", "title": "Osco-Umbrian languages", "text": "Osco-Umbrian languages\n\nThe Osco-Umbrian, Sabellic or Sabellian languages are a group of Italic languages, the Indo-European languages that were spoken in Central and Southern Italy by the Osco-Umbrians before being replaced by Latin, as the power of Ancient Rome expanded. They developed from the middle of the 1st millennium BC to the early centuries of the 1st millennium AD. The languages are known almost exclusively from inscriptions, principally of Oscan and Umbrian, but there are also some Osco-Umbrian loanwords in Latin.\n\nFollowing an original theory by Antoine Meillet (1866–1936), the Osco-Umbrian languages were traditionally considered a branch of the Italic languages, a language family that grouped Latin and Faliscan together with several other related languages. \nHowever, this unitary scheme was criticized by, among others, Alois Walde (1869–1924), Vittore Pisani (1899–1990) and Giacomo Devoto (1897–1974), who proposed a classification of the Italic languages into two distinct Indo-European branches. This view gained acceptance in the second half of the 1900s, although the exact processes of formation and penetration into Italy remains the object of research.\n\nOscan was one of the many languages spoken in the heart of the Italian peninsula, such as Umbrian and other languages belonging to the Sabine languages, such as Volscian, Sabine, South Picene, Marsian, Paeligni, Hernican, Marrucinian, Pre-Samnite and Sidicini.\n\nAequian and Vestinian may also have been part of the group.\n\nThey have traditionally been ascribed to either an Oscan group or an Umbrian group. However, they are all poorly attested, and such a division is not supported by evidence. It appears that they may have formed a continuum, with Umbrian in the north, Oscan in the south and the 'Sabellic' languages in between (see next section) having features of both.\n\nHowever, there were also colonies that spoke Oscan, scattered throughout Southern Italy and Sicily. Oscan was the language of the Samnite tribes, powerful enemies of the Romans, who took years to subdue them (the Samnite wars took place from 370 BC to 290 BC).\n\nThese languages are known from a few hundred inscriptions that are between 400 BC and the 1st century. In Pompeii there are numerous Oscan inscriptions, such as dedications in public buildings and signs.\n\nUmbrian began a process of decline when the Umbrians were subdued by the Romans and the process of Romanisation led to its demise. Of all the Osco-Umbrian languages, it is the one that is the best known, mainly because of the Iguvine Tablets.\n\nThese languages were spoken in Samnium and in Campania, partly in Apulia, Lucania and Bruttium, as well as by the Mamertines in the Sicilian colony of Messana (Messina).\n\n\"Sabellic\" was originally the collective ethnonym of the Italic people who inhabited central and southern Italy at the time of Roman expansion. The name was later used by Theodor Mommsen, in his \"Unteritalische Dialekte\" to describe the pre-Roman dialects of Central Italy that were neither Oscan nor Umbrian.\n\nThe term is currently used for the Osco-Umbrian languages as a whole. The word \"Sabellic\" was once applied to all such minor languages, Osco-Umbrian or not. North Picene was included even if it has always been known to have been unrelated.\n\nThe Osco-Umbrian languages or dialects of which testimony is preserved are:\n\nLittle-documented variants collectively known as \"Sabellic dialects\" are ascribed without much evidence to the two main groups. Some authors doubt such traditional classification, placing, for example, Aequian and Vestinian in opposite branches, instead of grouping them together.\n\nThe Osco-Umbrian languages are fusional inflected languages with about 5 different morphological cases in the singular, similar to those of Latin.\n\nAlthough the Osco-Umbrian languages are far more poorly attested than Latin, a corpus of a few thousand words' worth of inscriptions has allowed linguists to deduce some cladistic innovations and retentions. For example, while Proto-Indo-European aspirates appear as \"b\", \"d\" and \"h/g\" between vowels in Latin (\"medius\" < \"*medʰyos\"), the aspirates all appear in Sabellic as \"f\" (Oscan \"mefiai\"). In addition, while Latin retained the Proto-Indo-European labiovelar series (\"Q-Italic\"), the Osco-Umbrian languages merged them with the labials (\"P-Italic\"): Latin \"quattuor\", Oscan \"petora\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074276", "title": "Rag Doll (character)", "text": "Rag Doll (character)\n\nRag Doll is the name of three different supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Peter Merkel is a villain of the original Flash. The second Rag Doll is an enemy of Starman. The third Rag Doll is the son of the original and a member of the Secret Six.\n\nRag Doll made his live appearance on the fifth season of \"The Flash\" played by Troy James and voiced by Phil LaMarr. He returned in an episode of the sixth season.\n\nRag Doll was first introduced as an adversary for the Golden age Flash in a story published in \"Flash Comics\" #36 (December 1942), created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Lou Ferstadt.\n\nIn the \"Starman\" series, James Robinson revived the character, giving him a darker reimagining under the name Colby Zag.\n\nHis son, Peter Merkel, Jr., most recently used his father's name as a member of the Secret Six.\n\nPeter Merkel, a native of the Midwestern United States, was born with a unique condition, \"triple-jointedness\". Like the more common \"double-jointedness\", Merkel's condition was characterized by extremely extensible ligaments and tendons, though to a significantly extended degree. The son of a side-show barker, Merkel found work in a small local carnival as a contortionist and eccentric dancer. In the early 1940s, the carnival fell on hard times and Merkel found himself out of work. Wandering the streets, Merkel despaired of having money. Seeing large boxes of toys being loaded into a department store, Merkel hit on the idea of hiding himself in one of the large rag dolls and then robbing the store after closing. Going unnoticed among the toys, Merkel carried his idea one step further: He would rob while still hidden in the Rag Doll suit. In these earliest days of costumed villains, the idea seemed novel and Merkel decided that no one would believe that a Rag Doll could commit crime.\n\nIn time, the legend of the Rag Doll grew far and wide. Petty crooks began to seek out the Rag Doll, to take advantage of his criminal success. In 1943, the Rag Doll moved his operation to Keystone City. There he had his thugs deliver him as a gift to a young heiress named Geralda Cummins. The young girl was holding a much-touted party for her circle of socialites and the Rag Doll aimed to take advantage of the situation. To coordinate the event, Cummins had selected Joan Williams who had recently begun a party and festival business. It was decided that each of the wealthy guests would donate $10,000 in defense bonds to serve as a prize in a treasure hunt. Whoever solved the hunt first, won the prize. Unknown to Joan, the doll Geralda had received as a gift was listening and planning a much different outcome.\n\nThe next evening, the guests gathered to hear the reading of the first clue. As the guests departed, the Rag Doll signaled his thugs to follow them to the museum while he stayed to interrogate Joan Williams. His ploy was delayed however, by the untimely arrival of Williams' beau, Flash. While the Rag Doll remained in hiding, Williams and the Flash departed for the museum to provide the next clue. On their arrival, they were waylaid by the Rag Doll's thugs. While the Flash made short work of the henchmen, the Rag Doll himself drugged Joan with chloroform and stole the remaining clue. With these, he could find the treasure himself.\n\nWith the henchmen wrapped up, the Flash returned to find Joan amnesiac from the chloroform and with no recollection as to the location of the bonds. Taking the first clue, the Flash then began to solve the puzzle at super-speed and intercepted the Rag Doll on the 4th clue, at a local aquarium. The Rag Doll got the jump on Garrick with a swift blow to the skull and dumped the hero into an aquarium containing a giant octopus. He then raced quickly back to the Cummins estate to solve the treasure hunt with the 5th clue. Meanwhile, the Flash came to and after a tussle with the octopus, hotly pursued the criminal. He arrived just in time to see the Rag Doll pull the defense bonds out of their hiding place in the Cummins' grand piano. Quickly, and literally, tying the villain in knots, the Flash returned the gift and carted the outlandish criminal off to the Keystone City Jail.\n\nFlash is reported to have had several other encounters with the Rag Doll over the years but none have been recorded. In the mid-1970s, the Rag Doll became a pawn in a rather bizarre series of robberies. After an encounter with the Thinker, the Rag Doll became brainwashed to commit crimes based on dolls. When the Flash intercepted the criminal, mundane \"accidents\" befell the elder speedster, undermining his self-confidence. The Thinker's plan was to destroy the Flash's self-esteem to the point that the hero would be too ineffectual to stop his grander plans. The Thinker was undone however, by a surprise visit from the Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen, who quickly captured the former carnival worker. Allen also noticed a bizarre aura around the heads of Garrick and Merkel, suggesting that each was being manipulated in some way. At Merkel's interrogation, the Rag Doll swore that he had no recollection of any crimes, convincing Allen that there was a greater force at work. Quickly switching Merkel for a real rag doll, he convinced Garrick and the Keystone police that a bizarre transmogrification had occurred and that Merkel was somehow dead. He then departed, only to return and hide in the evidence room when the Thinker himself paid a visit to confirm the demise of his agent. Caught red-handed, the Thinker was quickly apprehended by the two Flashes and both the Thinker and the Rag Doll were returned to prison.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Rag Doll was contacted by the Ultra-Humanite, a long-standing foe of the Justice Society. Along with other elder villains as well as new younger recruits, the Rag Doll became a founding member of the second generation of the Secret Society of Super Villains. The Ultra-Humanite had devised a machine that, for the sacrifice of ten heroes from the Justice Society and Justice League to be held in stasis, (five from each team), all the heroes on Earth would disappear. Each villain then was assigned to dispose of his long-time nemesis and the Rag Doll took the Flash. After delivering a false tip to the Flash, the Rag Doll ambushed the hero on a freight ship in Keystone Harbor. After luring him into the hold, the Flash learned too late that all he would find there was a bomb, the explosion of which dropped the unconscious hero at the feet of his adversary.\n\nAs the other members of the Secret Society completed their task, the heroes were dispatched to Limbo, clearing Earth of costumed heroes. Unfortunately, the Ultra-Humanite had deceived the Earth-One villains into helping, by telling them they had an equal chance of their Earth being purged of heroes. This was not true. The Earth -One villains were placed in Limbo, but, while the Rag Doll and his colleagues waged a massive crime wave, the villains rescued the captured heroes in Limbo. In short order, the Secret Society of Super-Villains were consigned to Limbo and the balance of heroes on Earth was restored.\n\nLimbo would not prove a prison for the Rag Doll for long. While trapped there, the Ultra-Humanite made contact with himself in the past, when he occupied the body of Dolores Winters in 1942. Through the contact of advanced information, the Ultra-Humanite taught himself a way to open a portal to Limbo in the 1940s. On doing so, the Rag Doll and other members of the Secret Society escaped to assist the young Humanite defeat the All-Star Squadron. After a romp across the landscape of their youth, the aging villains proved no match for the large numbers of heroes and were beaten back to Limbo.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the Rag Doll was well into his 60s. His hyper-elastic ligaments had begun to collapse and over-extend, causing the villain great pain. Using his persuasive speaking skills he learned as a circus barker, he gathered together a cult of followers which he used to initiate a crime wave in Opal City. Ted \"Starman\" Knight, unable to stop the madman, asked Justice Society of America members Green Lantern, Flash, Hourman, and Dr. Mid-Nite to assist him. The heroes thwarted Rag Doll's plans and captured the villain. Restrained, Rag Doll taunted the heroes, telling him that he would command his horde from prison. He threatened the lives of Jay, Alan, and Ted's families. While the JSA listened, Rag Doll managed to slip free of his bonds. In the confusion, Rag Doll was killed. It has since been largely concluded that Starman, fearing for the safety of his sons, had slain the villain, a fact disputed by witnesses Flash and Green Lantern. The next afternoon, Rag Doll's body disappeared from the morgue.\n\nExactly how the Rag Doll survived is unknown. His body was retrieved by his followers. Some years later, Rag Doll was approached by the demon-lord Neron. In exchange for Rag Doll's soul, Neron restored the villain's youth and health and enhanced his flexibility. He also instructed Rag Doll to remain hidden until approached by a man named Simon Culp. Years later, Culp did come looking for Rag Doll's help. Trapped in the form of the Shade, Culp explained that he had a very profitable plan to launch against Opal City and the Shade. Rag Doll agreed to help.\n\nRag Doll helped Culp's gang subdue Mikaal Tomas when the alien attempted to make contact with Ted Knight. Rag Doll watched as Culp cast a spell on the Black Pirate, causing Opal City to become encased in a shadow-dome. Rag Doll and his gang then helped Culp seize control of the entire city. The villains then paraded their prisoners, baiting Jack Knight into a confrontation. Jack held his own until, cut off from the stars, his cosmic rod failed. As Rag Doll and the villains beat Jack down, the Shade fell to the ground as Culp emerged from within his shadow form.\n\nJust as Culp was about to slit Knight's throat, Adam Strange and Black Condor attacked. Their distraction enabled Knight to fight his way free. The three heroes freed Culp's prisoners, and escaped. Culp and his gang remained in custody of the Shade however, and withdrew to prepare for the final rite. While Culp prepared, he sent Mist, Solomon Grundy, Rag Doll, and Crusher to search for the escaped heroes \n\nTed confronted Doctor Phosphorus in the streets of Opal and, no longer needing to be cautious of his health, fought the villain toe-to-toe. Ted defeated his radioactive foe, but as he was about to deliver a killing blow, he was ambushed by the Rag Doll. Phosphorus quickly recovered and the two villains closed in on Knight. As they moved in for the kill, Ted used his cosmic rod to tear the pavement from beneath Dr. Phosphorus and drive him into the earth, killing the villain. With that, the rod's charge was exhausted. Ted turned to face Rag Doll, challenging the villain to kill him, sparing him a suffering death from Phosphorus' radiation poisoning. Rag Doll then turned and left.\n\nRag Doll was then recruited to join a new version of the Injustice Society. He helped rescue the Icicle from incarceration, leading to a showdown with the JSA. In the ensuing battle, the Injustice Society used strange discs to teleport the elder JSAers away. Their mission accomplished, the Injustice Society disappeared.\n\nHe then briefly rejoined a reformed version of the Secret Society. During an assault against the Secret Six, he battled his son (who had taken over the Rag Doll name and identity). Their battle was cut short by other attacking villains.\n\nSoon afterward, Rag Doll died while on a mission with the reformed Injustice Society (\"JSA Classified\" #5-7). The team was attempting to retrieve the Cosmic Key (which would return Johnny Sorrow), but they were betrayed by the Society.\n\nIn the midst of the battle, it appeared as if that Rag Doll and the Gentleman Ghost betrayed their comrades and ran away with the Key. However, Tigress witnessed the return of Johnny Sorrow whose sudden emergence killed Rag Doll, although Gentleman Ghost was prepared for it as he handed Sorrow his all-important mask. Sorrow and the rest of the Injustice Society escaped to safety in the Crooked House, the former abode of Prometheus. It was then revealed that Gentleman Ghost, Wizard and Icicle were expecting Rag Doll to turn on them, so they set him up to die.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Peter Merkel has been incarcerated in Arkham Asylum. Merkel first appears as one of the many inmates attempting to escape in a riot. Merkel later takes part in the Arkham War.\n\nJack Knight has also squared off against a mentally unbalanced impostor named Colby Zag. created by James Robinson. During the time when the original Rag Doll was believed dead, Zag met band player Mr. Tyrell through the internet. Tyrell had bribed his former bandmates to keep quiet about his involvement in a drug related death. Eventually, his bandmates began extorting more money from him, so Tyrell planned to kill them. He helped Zag adopt the personality and mannerisms of the Rag Doll and sent him to kill the extortionists. Zag succeeded in killing four of the five men, but was stopped thanks to the intervention of Jack Knight.\n\nPeter Merkel has a son named Peter Merkel Jr. who also operated as Rag Doll.\n\nBesides his son, Peter Merkel stated to Icicle that he had many other children. This seems backed up by Peter Merkel Junior's mention of having a triple-jointed brother and the recent appearances of his daughter Alex, a.k.a. Junior. Along with his children, Rag Doll also had his cult followers who all apparently committed suicide while blowing up their house.\n\nRag Doll is a master contortionist and, in later years, successful hypnotist through oratories he delivers. His body is absorbent enough to withstand concussive forces capable of rendering most human individuals unconscious. He is an adequate marksman and typically relies on the element of surprise. He is a skilled thief, and augments his stealth with his ability to hide in unexpected places where a human normally could not place themselves.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2074288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074288", "title": "Urban Ring Project (MBTA)", "text": "Urban Ring Project (MBTA)\n\nThe Urban Ring was a proposed project of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, to develop new public transportation routes that would provide improved circumferential connections among many existing transit lines that project radially from downtown Boston. The Urban Ring Corridor is located roughly one to two miles from downtown Boston, passing through the Massachusetts cities of Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Medford, Somerville, Cambridge, and Brookline. The project was expected to convert 41,500 car trips to transit trips daily.\n\nThe Major Investment Study split the project into three phases, the first of which (enhanced bus service) was partially implemented. The planning of Phase 2 was suspended in January 2010 because MBTA and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have insufficient funding to build a substantial portion of that phase (projected to cost $2.4 billion). , some interim bus service improvements have been implemented or are underway, in the absence of major funding.\n\nTransportation advocates in Boston have complained that rail transit riders cannot travel from one outlying area to another without first traveling to the downtown hub stations, changing lines, and traveling outbound again. Some of the radial transit lines, notably the Green Line, are so overcrowded that service is very slow and limited in capacity because of rush-hour \"crush loads\". There are several crosstown bus lines, such as the #1, #66, CT1, CT2, and CT3 routes, but they are slow, unreliable, and subject to bus bunching because they must operate in mixed street traffic.\n\nA circumferential rapid transit line was proposed by the City of Boston as early as 1923, and circumferential transit has been studied as early as 1972, in the Boston Transportation Planning Review. Detailed proposals were not studied until the late 1990s.\n\nThe proposed project has three phases. The first phase has been partially implemented. Phase 1, as it is commonly called, involves expanding \"crosstown\" bus lines serving the entire corridor and \"express commuter\" lines connecting to suburban locations. Phase 2 would create six overlapping Bus Rapid Transit lines forming a complete ring around downtown Boston. Phase 3 includes the implementation of rail service on the most heavily traveled portion of the ring, from Assembly Square in southeastern Somerville to Dudley Square in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, via East Cambridge.\n\nPhase 1 as recommended in the Major Investment Study, would expand the \"crosstown\" (CT) bus system by extending and increasing frequency on the three existing lines, and by adding eight new lines. It also adds \"express commuter\" (EC) lines for connections to locations outside the corridor. Estimated ridership according to the Phase 2 DEIR would have been 40,000 for 2003, at a capital cost of $100 million, for low-floor, low-emissions buses.\n\nThe MBTA determined that Phase 1 of the Urban Ring project did not meet the threshold requirements for an extensive environmental review, and so can be implemented as a part of its normal service planning process. However, of the eleven CT routes and three EC routes proposed, only CT1, CT2, and CT3 were running .\n\nThe MBTA filed the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for Phase 2 with the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) Office on November 30, 2004. In its FY2005-10 and draft FY2006-11 Capital Improvement Plans, the MBTA has not budgeted any money for the Urban Ring project, beyond supporting the EIR process.\n\nPhase 2 would convert and expand five of the \"crosstown\" lines (CT2, CT3, CT4, CT5, and CT8) into bus rapid transit lines that overlap and form a complete ring around the urban core.\n\n\nBRT connections with the commuter rail lines would be improved by expanding the following existing stations:\n\nThe following new Commuter Rail stations would be created:\n\nThe new BRT lines would make additional connections at other commuter rail stops, rapid transit stops, and bus hubs.\n\nSome parts of the BRT system would run in mixed traffic, including through the Ted Williams Tunnel and to the terminals at Logan International Airport. Dedicated lanes would be provided for certain portions, including:\n\nRidership was estimated at 106,000 passengers per day in 2010; capital cost was estimated at $500 million.\n\n, the revised route of the ring had the following stops:\n\nThis routing skips Gilman and Union Squares in Somerville, but these locations would be connected to the new Lechmere Station via the Green Line Extension Project, originally expected to be operational by the end of 2014, but initiated . The Grand Junction Railroad crossing of the Charles River would be widened to include bus lanes and a multi-use path.\nThere would be two major spurs. Three different routings were being considered for the first spur, on the west side of the ring, which would leave from Commonwealth Avenue and go to:\n\nThe second major spur, on the south side of the ring, would leave from between Crosstown Center and the BU Medical Center, and go to:\n\nThese proposal were fairly close to the route covered by the 66 bus.\n\nAn interim surface routing was proposed, with multiple stops in the Longwood Medical Area, while the tunnel would be under construction.\n\nThe capital cost for this version of the plan was estimated at $2.2 billion, with a projected daily ridership of 170,000. Approximately 53% of the route was either in a bus-only lane, dedicated busway, or tunnel. This was increased from the previous plan for Phase 2, to improve travel times. As a result of the implementation of Phase 2, ridership growth on the Red, Orange, Blue, and Green lines would be slowed, but Commuter Rail ridership boosted. The Urban Ring would have a higher collective ridership than the Orange Line, Blue Line, or the entire Commuter Rail system.\n\nPhase 3 would add a rail line on the most heavily traveled portion of the corridor, from Assembly Square in Somerville to Lechmere, Kendall Station, crossing Massachusetts Avenue near MIT, and connecting at Longwood Medical a, Ruggles, and Dudley Square. The exact alignment would be determined through further environmental review, and included possible stops in Union Square Somerville, Cambridgeport and/or Kenmore Square, and a possible new tunnel under the Charles River.\n\nThere were three alternatives being considered for Phase 3, which differed from the alternatives described in the Major Investment Study (MIS) and Draft Environmental Impact Review (DEIR). Employment growth projections have also changed since those documents were written.\n\nThe three proposed options for what type of rail service to build were:\n\n\nEstimated ridership is 282,000–293,000 passengers per day in 2025; about 47,000 would be diverted from cars, and most of the rest would be diverted from trips on congested radial lines, reducing the need to travel through downtown Boston.\n\nSince the suspension of the overall project, a segment of the original route was constructed, completing in 2018. The \"Silver Line Gateway\" service (route SL3) has commenced, connecting Downtown and South Boston to the inner-core city of Chelsea, with an intermediate stop serving Logan Airport. The route is a mix of dedicated right-of-way and shared street traffic segments, using articulated buses.\n\n\n"}

For example, at the start of the Waterloo campaign in 1815, while the Duke of Wellington's headquarters were in Brussels, most of his Anglo–allied army of 93,000 soldiers were \"cantoned\", or \"stationed\", to the south of Brussels. \n\nIn India and other parts of South Asia a \"cantonment\" refers to a permanent military station. In United States military parlance, a cantonment is, essentially, \"a permanent residential section (i.e. barracks) of a fort or other military installation,\" such as Fort Hood.\n\nThe former Sherpur Cantonment in Kabul, Afghanistan, which was the site of the Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment (1879) in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–1880), is now maintained as a British Army cemetery.\n\nIn Bangladesh, cantonments are residential quarters for many military personnel aside from soldiers. These individuals include officers, teachers, military doctors, military nurses, junior commanding officers, and non–commissioned Officers. A wide variety of military training is provided in the Bangladeshi cantonments:\n\n\nThe Indian Army maintains a training mission in Bhutan, known as the Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) which is responsible for the military training of the Royal Bhutan Army (RBA) and Royal Bodyguard (RBG) personnel. All RBA and RBG officers are sent for training at the National Defence Academy and the Indian Military Academy. Moreover, Project Dantak, a division of the Indian Border Roads Organisation and subdivision of the Indian Army Corps of Engineers, was established in Bhutan on 24 April 1961, with its first commanding officer, Colonel TV Jaganathan. Project Dantak has since been responsible for the construction and maintenance of more than codice_1 of roads and bridges, Paro Airport, a disused airfield at Yongphulla Airport, heliports, and other infrastructure. These serve India's strategic defence needs, but also provide economic benefits for the Bhutani citizens. \n\nSeveral cities among the Indian subcontinent, such as Ahmedabad, Ambala, Belgaum, Bangalore, Danapur, Jabalpur, Kanpur, Bathinda, Delhi, Meerut, Pune, Peshawar, Ramgarh, Rawalpindi, Sialkot, Secunderabad, and Trichy, contained large cantonments of the former British Indian Army, with Meerut and Ramgarh being two of the most important cantonments in northern India, second only to the headquarters at Rawalpindi. Meerut was established in 1803 and for 150 years was the largest cantonment in the region. Although cantonments in India were considered to be semi-permanent in the 18th and 19th centuries, by the turn of the 20th century they had transitioned to being permanent garrisons. They were further entrenched as such, via the military reforms of Lord Kitchener in 1903, and the Cantonments Act of 1924.\n\n\nCantonments in Nigeria refer to permanent military installations which house active personnel and their families. Cantonments in Nigeria include:\n\n\nIn Singapore, the term is used to denote a police cantonment.\n\n\nThe United States military commonly uses the term \"cantonment\" to describe the permanent facilities at U.S. Army training bases as opposed to the field training areas. Cantonment areas often include housing (such as barracks and maid-service quarters), dining facilities, training classrooms, exchanges, and paved air fields.\n\nThere are sixty-two \"notified cantonments\" in India, occupying an area of 1,057,000 acres: twenty-five in Central Command, nineteen in Southern Command, thirteen in Western Command, four in Eastern Command, and one in Northern Command. In addition 15,096,000 acres are in use for military garrisons, offices, and training areas. Major cantonments and garrisons include the following: \n\n\n\n"}

After a distinguished career as a professional player in South Korea from 1982–1997, Lee moved on to coaching in 1998, including positions on the coaching staff of the Chicago White Sox, and came back to South Korea in 2006 to serve as a bench coach for the Wyverns.\n\nUpon graduation from Hanyang University in 1982, Lee made an agreement with the Korea Baseball Organization to play for one of the new pro league's teams instead of remaining in the amateur league. Prior to the inaugural Korean professional baseball season, Lee was finally signed by the Samsung Lions. In the first game of the KBO pro league on March 27, 1982, Lee hit the first home run in Korean professional baseball history against the MBC Chungyong. Lee was a regular catcher of the Lions during the 1982 season and helped his team to reach to the inaugural Korean Series, where the Lions lost to the OB Bears, 4–1–1.\n\nLee, nicknamed \"Hulk\" and \"Babe Ruth of Korea\" for his power and home run ability, was a full-time catcher and first baseman for 16 seasons with the Samsung Lions, hitting 252 home runs and knocking in 861 RBIs during his career. In 1983, he won his first home run title and was named League MVP, and the next year became the league's first triple crown winner as the leader in three major offensive categories ― home runs (23), runs batted in (80) and batting average (.340). \nHis Home Run and RBI totals also led the league in 1985. Gold Gloves came in 5 straight years, 1983–1987, and he appeared in 12 All-Star games. Lee's ultimate career home run total, 252, remained the record until Jang Jong-Hoon of the Hanwha Eagles hit his 253rd on May 23, 1999.\n\nAfter retiring in 1997, Lee began his coaching career in the United States as the hitting coach for the Class A Kinston Indians in 1998. He moved to the White Sox organization in 1999, and served as the first base coach for the White Sox AAA affiliate Charlotte Knights until assuming his bullpen position with the big club in 2000. From 2000 to 2006, Lee was a coaching staff for the Chicago White Sox, the first Korean to coach in the major leagues. In 2005, as a coach for the White Sox, he earned a World Series ring following the 2005 World Series.\n\nAfter the 2006 season, Lee returned to South Korea and signed a two-year contract with the SK Wyverns as the club's bench coach on October 30, 2006. On August 18, 2011, SK Wyverns manager Kim Sung-keun was sacked following his decision to retire from coaching after the 2011 season.

The ministry operates the state-owned Indian Railways, an organisation that operates as a monopoly in rail transport and is headed by the Chairman of Railway Board. The Ministry of Railways along with the Railway Board is housed inside Rail Bhavan in New Delhi.\n\nThe ministry has a Union Minister and Minister of State. The Railway Board, which is the apex body of the Indian Railways, reports to parliament through the Ministry of Railways. The Railway Board comprises one Chairman, seven \"members of the Railway Board\", and a Financial Commissioner (who is the representative of the Ministry of Finance in the Railway Board). It also includes a Director-General (Railway Health Services), Director-General (personal) and a Director-General (Railway Protection Force). A number of directorates report to the Railway Board. Most of the officers posted in Ministry of Railways are either from organised \"Group A Railway services\" or the Railway Board Secretariat Service.\n\nCurrent Minister of Railways:\n\nCurrent Ministers of State for Railways:\n\nPresent Members of Railway Board:\n\nIn 1901, on the recommendations of Sir Thomas Robertson Committee regarding the administration and working of the railways, an early version of the railway board was constituted. It initially had three members.\n\nIn 1905, its powers were formalised by Lord Curzon's government. Its membership consisted of a Government Railway official, who was the Chairman of the Board, a Railway Manager from England and an Agent of a Company Railway. The Board was placed under the Department of Commerce and Industry of the British Indian Government. \n\nIn 1921, a reorganisation of the Railway Board was carried out, and a Chief Commissioner of Railways was appointed, who was solely responsible to the Government for decisions on technical matters and for advising the Government on matters of policy. Pursuant to the Acworth Committee's recommendations in 1921, the Railway Board was reconstituted with effect from 1 April 1924. The reconstituted board consisted of the Chief Commissioner, a Financial Commissioner and two members. One was responsible for ways and works, and projects and stores. The other was responsible for general administration, staff and traffic. \n\nIn 1929, an additional post at the member level was added to the board. It was given responsibility for staff, so that that the member in charge of traffic could focus solely on transport and commercial matters. During this time, Frank D'Souza became the first Indian member of the board.\n\nIn April, 1951 the post of Chief Commissioner was abolished and the senior-most functional member was appointed the Chairman of the Board, resulting in a membership of four. \n\nIn October 1954, the Chairman of the Board was made responsible for decisions on technical and policy matters, with the status of a Secretary to Government in the Ministry of Railways. One more Member was also added and the strength of the Board again became five.\n\nIn 1988, a new member with responsibility for signals, telecommunication and electrical matters was added to the board. On 16 April 2019 two more members, one with responsibility for signals and telecommunications, and another for material management, joined the board. At this point, the Railway Board had a strength of eight—a Chairman, and seven members. The Chairman is assisted by officers of Railway Board Secretariat Service.\n\nOn 24 December 2019, the Union Cabinet decided to reduce the size of the board from eight to five. It also decided to merge its different cadres into a single Railway Management Service. The newly constituted Board will have Members for \"Operation,[sic] Business Development, Human Resources, Infrastructure and Finance\".\n\nThe East India Railway Committee, chaired by Sir William Acworth reported that there was a need for unified management of the entire railway system. On the recommendations of this committee and ratification of a resolution to do so in 1921, the government took over the actual management of all the railways, and also separated the railway finances from the general governmental finances. It also began to present the Railway Budget separately from the general budget of India every year. The Railway Board was expanded to have a Financial Commissioner, a member in charge of ways, works, stores and projects, and a member in charge of administration, staff, and traffic. Accordingly, from 1 April 1929, the responsibility for the compilation of accounts for the Railways was taken over by the Financial Commissioner, Railways from the Auditor General.\n\nThe last Railway Budget was presented on 25 February 2016 by Mr. Suresh Prabhu. The Modi government on 21 September 2016 approved merger of the rail and general budgets from 2017, ending a 92-year-old practice of a separate budget.\n\nOn 14 February 2008, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, admitted to violating Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) regulations by making improper payments from its subsidiary Pioneer Friction Limited, based in Calcutta, to government officials of the Indian railway board. Payments were made in order to obtain and retain business with the Railway Board and curb taxes.\n\nOn 3 May 2013, the CBI arrested Railway Minister's nephew, Vijay Singla for accepting an alleged bribe of , which was part of a larger sum of Rs. 100 million (US$16.2 million) from a middleman on behalf of Mahesh Kumar, in return for his appointment as Member (Electrical) of the Railway Board.

RailTel was formed in September 2000 with the objective of creating nationwide broadband, telecom and multimedia network, to modernise train control operation and safety system of Indian Railways. RailTel's network passes through around 5,000 stations across the country, covering all major commercial centres.\n\nThe Indian Railways (IR) was initially solely dependent on the Department of Telecom (now BSNL) for their control and administrative communication circuits. To increase circuit efficiency, the Railways began building up its own communication systems from early 1970s based on overhead telephone lines, quad cables and microwave signalling. In 1983, the Railway Reforms Committee decided to introduce optical fibre cable (OFC) based communications in IR to provide safety, reliability, availability and serviceability through use of a dedicated network. The decision was also taken to create a network independent of the DoT and replace the existing microwave telecom systems (60% of which had reached end of life) with OFC.\n\nIndian Railways commissioned the first OFC on the Churchgate–Virar line in Mumbai in 1988 for train operation and control purpose, which consisted of 60 km of network across 28 stations. The network was expanded in Central India with the commissioning of 900 km of OFC network in 1991–92 across Durg–Nagpur, Nagpur–Itarsi and Itarsi–Bhusaval sections of the Howrah–Nagpur–Mumbai line, and in Eastern India with the commissioning of 60 km of OFC network in Tatanagar–Chakradhrapur section of the same line.\n\nThe second National Telecom Policy in 1999 opened the National Long-Distance segment under favourable licensing conditions with revenue sharing to assist mobile network operators to spread their networks across India. In 2000, the Government announced the formation of a telecom corporation to build a nationwide broadband multimedia telecommunication network. RailTel was established in September 2000 as a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU), wholly owned by the Indian Railways.\n\nRailTel, in collaboration with Google, provides free WiFi access at selected railways stations across India. Google chose railway stations as the location to provide free WiFi because stations have access to reliable power supply and fibre provided by RailTel, and because the passengers at a station come from all demographics of India.\n\nThe free WiFi service was launched at Mumbai Central railway station in January 2016.

However, Venture Technologies has notified Radio World that it would not take Mega Media's offer and Mega Media ceased operations in October 2009.\n\nAfter converting KSFV to digital, Venture Technologies maintained the channel 6 analog service by acquiring KZNO-LP in Big Bear Lake and moving Guadalupe Radio to the latter.\n\nThe station's digital channel is multiplexed.\n"}

Through this youth wing and a special task force of the party, Rastakhiz embarked upon a large-scale anti-profiteering campaign directed against the \"bazaari\" merchants, who were soon identified as \"enemies of the state\". They often lied about Jewish persecution, which is backed up to be lies in government files. In October 1975, the Shah, referring to this campaign as a \"cultural movement\", decreed that anti-profiteerism be made the fourteenth principle of the White Revolution.\n\nThe single party system ended in late 1978 as the Iranian Revolution gained ground.\n\n\n"}

(1994).\n\nIn developing the theory of \"archaeology of knowledge\", Foucault was trying to analyse the fundamental codes which a culture uses to construct the \"episteme\" or configuration of knowledge that determines the empirical orders and social practices of each particular historical era. He adopted discontinuity as a positive working tool. Some of the discourse would be regular and continuous over time as knowledge steadily accumulates and society gradually establishes what will constitute truth or reason for the time being. But, in a transition from one era to the next, there will be overlaps, breaks and discontinuities as society reconfigures the discourse to match the new environment. \n\nThe tool is given an expanded role in \"genealogy\", the next phase of discourse analysis, where the intention is to grasp the total complexity of the use of power and the effects it produces. Foucault sees power as the means for constituting individuals’ identities and determining the limits of their autonomy. This reflects the symbiotic relationship between \"power\" (\"pouvoir\") and \"knowledge\" (\"savoir\"). In his study of prisons and hospitals, he observed how the modern individual becomes both an object and subject of knowledge. Science emerges as a means of directing and shaping lives. Hence, the modern conception of sexuality emerges from Christian codes of morality, the science of psychology, the laws and enforcement strategies adopted by the police and judiciary, the way in which issues of sexuality are discussed in the public media, the education system, etc. These are covert forms of domination (if not oppression), and their influence is to be found not only in what is said, but more importantly, in what is not said: in all the silences and lacunae, in all the discontinuities. If one idea is discussed, then it is not discussed, whose interest is served by this change?\n\n"}

{"id": "2074394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074394", "title": "KTLA", "text": "KTLA\n\nKTLA, virtual channel 5 (UHF digital channel 35), is a CW-affiliated television station licensed to Los Angeles, California, United States. Owned by Nexstar Media Group, it is the company's largest market station. KTLA's studios are located at the Sunset Bronson Studios on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, and its transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson.\n\nKTLA was the first commercially licensed television station in the western United States, having begun operations in January 1947. Although not as widespread in national carriage as its Chicago sister station WGN-TV, KTLA is available as a superstation via DirecTV and Dish Network (the latter service available only to grandfathered subscribers that had purchased its a la carte superstation tier before Dish halted sales of the package to new subscribers in September 2013), as well as on cable providers in select cities within the southwestern United States and throughout Canada.\n\nThe station was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1939 as experimental station W6XYZ, broadcasting on VHF channel 4; it did not sign on the air until September 1942. The station was originally owned by Paramount Pictures subsidiary Television Productions, Inc., and was based at the Paramount Studios lot. Klaus Landsberg, already an accomplished television pioneer at the age of 26, was the original station manager and engineer.\n\nOn January 22, 1947, the station was licensed for commercial broadcasting as KTLA on channel 5, becoming the first commercial television station in Los Angeles, the first to broadcast west of the Mississippi River, and the eighth commercial television station in the United States. Estimates of television sets in Los Angeles County at the time ranged from 350 to 600, since experimental station W6XAO (later KTSL and KNXT, now KCBS-TV) was already in operation broadcasting with a regular schedule. Bob Hope served as the emcee for KTLA's inaugural broadcast, titled as \"The Western Premiere of Commercial Television\", which was broadcast live that evening from a garage on the Paramount Studios lot and featured appearances from many Hollywood luminaries. Hope delivered what was perhaps the most famous line of the telecast when, at the program's start, he identified the new station as \"KTL\" – mistakenly omitting the \"A\" at the end of the call sign. A 10-minute fragment from KTLA's first broadcast exists at the Paley Center for Media.\n\nKTLA was originally affiliated with the DuMont Television Network, of which Paramount held a minority stake; it disaffiliated from the network in 1948 and converted into an independent station. Despite this, the FCC still considered Paramount as controlling manager of DuMont due to the strength of the company's voting stock and their influence in managing the network. As a result, the agency did not allow DuMont to buy additional VHF stations—a problem that would later play a large role in the failure of DuMont, whose programming was splintered among other Los Angeles stations—including KTSL, KHJ-TV (channel 9, now KCAL-TV), KTTV (channel 11) and KCOP-TV (channel 13)—until the network's demise in 1956. Paramount even launched a short-lived programming service, the Paramount Television Network, in 1948, with KTLA and WBKB-TV (now WBBM-TV) in Chicago serving as its flagship stations. The service never gelled into a true television network, but during KTLA's early years, the station produced over a dozen series that were syndicated in much of the U.S., including \"Armchair Detective\", \"Bandstand Revue\", \"Dixie Showboat\", \"Frosty Frolics\", \"Hollywood Reel\", \"Hollywood Wrestling\", \"Latin Cruise\", \"Movietown, RSVP\", \"Olympic Wrestling\", \"Sandy Dreams\", and \"Time for Beany\".\n\nIn 1958, KTLA moved its operations into the Paramount Sunset Studios on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. For many years, those who have worked on Stage 6 at KTLA were told that it was the site where Al Jolson's landmark film \"The Jazz Singer\" was shot in 1927, when the lot was known as the Warner Bros. Sunset Studios; Mark Evanier, who wrote for one such show in 1978, points out on his website that Stage 6 did not even exist at the time that \"The Jazz Singer\" was produced and that it was actually probably filmed at what is now Stage 9. The former Warner Bros./Paramount lot is now known as Sunset Bronson Studios, where KTLA's facility remains based to this day, and where shows such as \"WKRP in Cincinnati\", \"Judge Judy\", \"Hannah Montana\", \"The Gong Show\", \"Solid Gold\", \"Name That Tune\", \"Family Feud\", \"The Newlywed Game\", \"MADtv\" and \"Let's Make a Deal\" have been produced over the years. KTLA is currently the only Los Angeles area broadcaster that remains based in Hollywood as many other television and radio stations have moved to other parts of the region.\n\nIn November 1963, KTLA was purchased by actor and singer Gene Autry for $12 million; upon the sale's finalization in May 1964, Autry merged the station with his other broadcasting properties, including KMPC radio (710 AM, now KSPN) into an umbrella company known as Golden West Broadcasters. During the 1970s, KTLA was uplinked to satellite and became one of the nation's first superstations; the station was eventually carried on cable providers across much of the United States located west of the Mississippi River.\n\nKTLA sought a different programming strategy from its competitors during the late 1960s and 1970s, emphasizing syndicated reruns of off-network hour long dramas with a heavy emphasis on western-themed programs such as \"The Gene Autry Show\", \"Bonanza\", \"The Big Valley\", first-run talk shows, movies and sports programming. Children's programs, with the exception of weekend morning \"Popeye\" cartoons (which originally came from former parent Paramount, but had been sold off to what became the syndication arm of United Artists Television), were also phased out. Popeye continued Sunday Mornings but with only the 1960s King Features episodes. Later in the 1970s more drama shows like \"Kung Fu\", \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Starsky & Hutch\" were added. In 1979, KTLA acquired much of the programming inventory of struggling independent competitor KBSC-TV (channel 52, now Telemundo owned-and-operated station KVEA) including \"The Little Rascals\", \"The Three Stooges\", \"The Munsters\", \"The Addams Family\", \"Gilligan's Island\", \"Leave It to Beaver\", among others. These shows ran weekend mornings and weekend early afternoons. In 1979, KTLA acquired \"Happy Days\", in 1981 \"Laverne & Shirley\", \"Little House On The Prairie\", in 1982 \"Taxi\", and \"CHiPs\", among other shows. The station continued to emphasize hour long dramas during the day on weekdays but began to run recent sitcoms in the evenings.\n\nIn November 1982, Golden West sold KTLA to investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $245 million. In May 1985, KKR sold the station to Chicago-based Tribune Broadcasting, for a then-record price of $510 million, which beat the station's earlier record sale price set by the 1982 acquisition by KKR. Under Tribune, KTLA continued to acquire high rated off-network sitcoms as well as talk shows for its schedule.\n\nKTLA became an affiliate of the MGM/UA Premiere Network, a film-based ad hoc television network, with the showing of \"Clash of the Titans\". The station added the syndicated Action Pack programming block to its schedule starting in mid-January 1994.\n\nKTLA spent much of the early and mid-1980s battling KTTV (channel 11) for the spot of the top-rated independent station in Southern California, offering a variety of general entertainment programs including movies, sports and off-network reruns; it took the top spot among the market's independents full-time after KTTV became a Fox charter station upon that network's start-up in October 1986. The station stayed out of the kids' business throughout the 1980s, unlike other Tribune stations but acquired stronger programming like \"Charles In Charge\", \"Full House,\" \"Cheers,\" \"Punky Brewster,\" and \"Silver Spoons.\" The station also mixed in a few classic sitcoms weekday early mornings as well as on weekends. In the summer of 1991, the station debuted a two-hour weekday morning newscast. Sitcoms ran on the station 9 a.m. to noon weekdays.\n\nOn November 2, 1993, the Warner Bros. Television division of Time Warner and the Tribune Company announced the formation of The WB Television Network. Due to the company's ownership interest in the network (initially a 12.5% stake, later expanding to 22%), Tribune signed its seven existing independent stations (one such station, Atlanta's WGNX, joined CBS instead one month prior to The WB's launch), along with an eighth that the company had acquired the following year, to serve as The WB's charter affiliates. With this, KTLA became a network affiliate for the first time in 47 years when The WB launched on January 11, 1995.\n\nLike with other WB-affiliated stations during the network's first four years, KTLA initially continued to essentially program as a \"de facto\" independent station as The WB had broadcast only a two-hour primetime schedule on Wednesday nights at the network's launch; the station continued to broadcast films in prime time along with some first-run syndicated scripted series on nights when network programs did not air. The WB would eventually carry prime time shows six nights a week (Sunday through Friday) by September 1999. In September 1995, KTLA added afternoon cartoons and Saturday morning cartoons from the network's newly launched Kids' WB block, bringing weekday children's programs back to channel 5 for the first time in close to 25 years. The station continued use the \"Channel 5\" brand it used prior to its WB affiliation (with The WB logo simply tacked onto the station's \"Gold 5\" logo) until 1997, when the station overhauled its on-air branding to \"KTLA 5, L.A.'s WB\".\nThe Tribune Company purchased the Times Mirror Company (then-owners of the \"Los Angeles Times\") in 2000, bringing the newspaper into common ownership with channel 5; ironically, the \"Los Angeles Times\" was the original owner of Fox owned-and-operated station KTTV from 1949 (under a joint venture with CBS through 1951) until it sold the station to Metromedia (successor to DuMont's owned and operated stations) in 1963 (that company would eventually become Fox Television Stations upon Metromedia's 1986 merger with News Corporation); as FCC rules prohibited the common ownership of newspapers and broadcast outlets in the same market, Tribune filed for and was granted a waiver by the agency in order to acquire the \"Times\". The \"Times\" and KTLA were separated on August 4, 2014, when Tribune spun off its publishing division into a separate company; KTLA and Tribune's other broadcasting properties (as well as its Media Services and real estate units) remained with the original company, which was renamed as the Tribune Media Company.\n\nKTLA unveiled a new branding campaign on January 1, 2005, that omitted all references to its over-the-air channel 5 position (although the references returned after the station became a CW affiliate one year later). The new look included a modernized logo with a halo emblem over the KTLA calls and WB logo, and a change in branding to \"KTLA, The WB\".\n\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW. With the announcement, Tribune Broadcasting signed ten-year agreements for KTLA and 16 of the company's 18 other WB-affiliated stations (three of which it would sell to other groups shortly before The CW launched including WLVI, WATL, and WCWN) to become charter affiliates of The CW. The station changed its branding to \"KTLA 5, The CW\" on September 17, 2006 immediately after the airing of The WB's final broadcast, \"The Night of Favorites and Farewells\".\nOn January 22, 2007, KTLA celebrated its 60th anniversary of continuous broadcasting. Two days later, on January 24, 2007, KTLA became the first television entity to be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In addition to the station itself, six other individuals associated with KTLA—former owner Gene Autry, newsmen Hal Fishman, George Putnam, Stan Chambers and Larry McCormick, and founding manager Klaus Landsberg—have received stars on the Walk of Fame. In addition, KTLA continued its celebration on the weekend after Thanksgiving with a 60-hour marathon of classic shows that aired on KTLA in the past such as \"The Honeymooners\", \"The Jack Benny Program\", \"The Little Rascals\", \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Peter Gunn\". KTLA also aired retrospectives of historic Los Angeles news stories during its weekend evening newscasts, until November 24 due to coverage of the Corral Canyon fire in Malibu.\n\nOn February 14, 2008, the Tribune Company sold Tribune Studios and related real estate in Los Angeles to equity firm Hudson Capital LLC for $125 million, with the studio lot being renamed Sunset Bronson Studios following the sale. There had been speculation that KTLA would move into the Los Angeles Times Building in downtown Los Angeles, combining operations and staff with the \"Times\" newspaper; this arrangement is also used by two other Tribune combined newspaper-broadcast operations: Miami's WSFL-TV is based in the offices of former sister newspaper \"Sun-Sentinel\", while the Hartford duopoly of WTIC-TV/WTXX moved into new facilities in the \"Hartford Courant\" building in December 2009.\n\nOn October 14, 2009, KTLA unveiled a new logo and a redesigned news set, bringing back the classic stylized number \"5\" that was previously used by the station from 1981 to 1997, and eliminating The CW's logo from regular usage (though it is still used in promotions for the network's programs). The \"LA\" in the KTLA callsign is rendered in bold lettering to emphasize the station's Los Angeles location and coverage area, similar to a previous wordmark logo used from 1997 to 2005.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. The deal would have given KTLA additional sister stations in Sinclair's existing properties in Bakersfield (where the group already owns CBS affiliate KBAK-TV and Fox affiliate KBFX-CD) and Fresno (where it owns Fox affiliate KMPH-TV and CW affiliate KFRE-TV). The prospect of Sinclair acquiring KTLA was met with consternation among station employees, due to concerns over the influence the company might have on the station's news content. Sinclair has been known for requiring its stations to run news reports and commentaries that reflect a conservative perspective; the city of Los Angeles and some adjacent and outlying suburbs are predominately liberal, while some outlying areas elsewhere in the market (including portions of Orange County) lean conservative.\n\nOn July 18, 2018, hours after Sinclair submitted a revision to the acquisition proposal that rescinded plans for WGN-TV and CW-affiliated sisters KDAF in Dallas–Fort Worth and KIAH in Houston to be sold to closely tied third-party companies—WGN-TV LLC and Cunningham Broadcasting, respectively—in order to address concerns expressed by FCC chairman Ajit Pai concerning the partner licensees Sinclair proposed using to allow it to operate certain Tribune stations in circumvention of the 39% national ownership cap, the FCC Commissioners' Board voted unanimously, 4–0, to send the Sinclair-Tribune acquisition proposal to an evidentiary review hearing before an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain stations in markets where Sinclair and Tribune both had television properties. On August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, and concurrently filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the DOJ over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group announced it would acquire Tribune's assets for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal—which would make Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations upon its expected closure late in the third quarter of 2019—would give KTLA additional sister stations in the same two markets where it would have gained adjacent outlets under the aborted Sinclair deal (Nexstar owns NBC affiliate KGET-TV and low-power Telemundo affiliate KKEY-LP in Bakersfield and NBC affiliate KSEE and CBS affiliate KGPE in Fresno) as well as an additional sister station upstate in the San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose market (MyNetworkTV affiliate KRON-TV, which – as a result of the group's decision to sell New York City sister station and the largest Tribune property by market size, WPIX, to the E. W. Scripps Company on March 20, 2019 – would be displaced as Nexstar's largest station property by KTLA). The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKTLA, in the tradition of television pioneering successes, was an FCC volunteer \"early adopter\" HD station. On October 28, 1998, KTLA-DT signed on with the West Coast's first commercially broadcast high definition programming. It was on UHF channel 31 in 1080i 16:9 format. Frank Geraty was the KTLA Director of Broadcast Operations and Engineering, and Ira Goldstone was the Corporate VP of Engineering. At precisely 9 a.m., VIP Milton Berle threw the ceremonial \"Transmit On\" switch, as he did at the Chicago World's Fair in 1939 at the birth of analog television broadcasting. The modern day event took place during KTLA's signature morning news broadcast and KTLA HD programming began simultaneously transmitting for the first time along with its analog channel. KTLA-DT went on to do the first HD Rose Parade and the first HD Dodgers baseball game broadcasts in the several months that followed.\n\nKTLA shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 31, using PSIP to display KTLA's virtual channel as 5 on digital television receivers.\n\nVeteran newsman Stan Chambers, who was hired by KTLA almost a year after its 1947 launch and remained with the station until his retirement in 2010, was given the honor of \"throwing\" a ceremonial mock switch from the analog to digital position, signaling the engineers to shut down the analog signal at its Mount Wilson transmitter site at 10:45 p.m., during KTLA's \"Prime News\" telecast. Covering the on-air event for KTLA was Stan's grandson, reporter Jaime Chambers. As part of the SAFER Act, KTLA temporarily restored its analog signal 15 minutes later at 11:00 p.m. to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.\n\nKTLA was one of nearly 1,000 television stations that changed their digital signal allocation in the spectrum auction repack of late 2017 or early 2018. The station reallocated to UHF channel 35 in phase two of the auction. The spectrum change took place on March 18, 2019.\n\nKTLA clears the entire CW schedule, although since the expansion of its Saturday morning newscast in May 2014, it has aired the network's children's block—currently known as \"One Magnificent Morning\"—three hours later (from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.) than the network's other Pacific Time Zone affiliates until September 30, 2017. From October 7 to December 30, 2017, the station aired the \"OMM\" block locally on a two-hour delayed basis from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. On January 6, 2018, the station began airing the \"OMM\" block again on a three-hour delayed basis, this time from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., due to the expansion of its weekend morning newscast to five hours. The station also airs The CW reruns of the syndicated talk show \"The Jerry Springer Show\" at 2:00 p.m.—one hour earlier than the network's recommended timeslot at 3:00 p.m.—due to its 3:00 p.m. newscast (a scheduling inherited from \"The Bill Cunningham Show\" after KTLA displaced the program from its network-dictated timeslot following the launch of its mid-afternoon newscast in December 2014 and, most recently, \"The Robert Irvine Show\"). Syndicated programs broadcast by KTLA () include \"Maury\", \"Friends\", \"Mom\" and \"Two and a Half Men\".\n\nKTLA has also broadcast the annual Tournament of Roses Parade from Pasadena each New Year's Day since 1948; while other local stations have also broadcast the parade over the years, KTLA remains the sole English-language outlet in the Los Angeles market to continuously broadcast the event. The station also served as host broadcaster of the Hollywood Christmas Parade, which was later syndicated to all Tribune-owned stations and the Hallmark Channel, a role it resumed in 2015 when The CW received the national broadcast rights. KTLA also broadcasts the San Diego Big Bay Boom 4th of July fireworks show, with coverage produced by sister station KSWB-TV.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1995, KTLA served as the broadcast television home of the Los Angeles/California Angels baseball team, after then-Angels owner Gene Autry purchased the station through Golden West Broadcasters. The television rights to Angels games moved to KCAL-TV in 1996 (which KTLA had previously assumed broadcast rights from, and whose then-owner The Walt Disney Company's ownership interest in the Angels briefly overlapped with KCAL's contract with the team).\n\nKTLA served as the local over-the-air television broadcaster rights to Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games from 1993 to 2001. The station would return to its over-the-air relationship with the Dodgers on September 2, 2016, when KTLA entered into an agreement with Charter Communications (which had acquired Time Warner Cable's Southern California systems earlier that year through its acquisition of the latter cable provider) to simulcast six regular season games scheduled for the final two weeks of the 2016 season to which regional sports network SportsNet LA already held rights to broadcast through its contract with the Dodgers. This arrangement would extend into the following year, when on March 8, 2017, SportsNet LA agreed to simulcast ten Dodgers games scheduled during the first and last five weeks of the 2017 regular season on KTLA. The original decision for the simulcasting arrangement was made after complaints were raised that fans would not be able to watch the final broadcasts of retiring legendary commentator Vin Scully, since SportsNet LA's availability in Southern California is primarily limited to Charter Spectrum systems because of disagreements between Charter/TWC and five major television providers serving the region (Cox Communications, Frontier FiOS, AT&T U-verse, DirecTV and Dish Network) over transmission rates that have prevented them from agreeing to carry the channel. Channel 5 would continue this arrangement with SportsNet LA since the 2018 season.\n\nKTLA also carried selected Los Angeles Lakers road games from 1967 to 1977, and as well as selected Los Angeles Kings road games during that same time period (and again selected telecasts during the majority of the Wayne Gretzky era in the late 1980s to mid 1990s). KTLA was also the over-the-air home of the Los Angeles Clippers for two periods, from 1985 to 1991 and from 2002 to 2009. Other than telecasts of preseason games from the Las Vegas Raiders (who were based in Los Angeles from 1982 until the team returned to Oakland in 1994) syndicated by the Las Vegas Silver and Black Network, along with a 30-minute show each weekend during the regular season before the game, KTLA does produce one sporting event each year, the LA Marathon, which features many of the \"Morning News\" on-air staff, along with running specialists on a Sunday morning in February/March of each year.\n\nKTLA presently broadcasts 82 hours, 5 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 12 hours, 35 minutes each weekday; 9 hours, 5 minutes on Saturdays and 10 hours, 5 minutes on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest newscast output among television stations in California and in the United States as a whole. KTLA produces a 15-minute sports wrap-up show every night at 10:45 p.m., during \"KTLA 5 News at 10:00\"; produces a 30-minute show, \"KTLA 5 Sports Final\", on the weekends at 11:35 p.m. after \"KTLA 5 News at 11:00\".\n\nKTLA's news department is located inside the former Warner Bros. Cartoons studio (known as the Hal Fishman Newsroom since 2000) at the corner of Van Ness and Fernwood in Hollywood. Although KTLA does not cover police pursuits as much as other stations, it has put more emphasis in local crime stories, as opposed to politics, health and other serious news. KTLA has also created synergy between Tribune Company entities. For example, entertainment reporter Sam Rubin is often featured in addition to his KTLA work as the main Los Angeles-based entertainment reporter for Chicago sister station WGN-TV. \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist David Lazarus also frequently reports on consumer stories from the paper's headquarters in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nFor many years, Channel 5's news department, which has existed since its sign-on, was considered the benchmark of Los Angeles television. In 1958, KTLA began operating a well-equipped helicopter for newsgathering known as the \"Telecopter\", and was the most advanced airborne television broadcast device of its time; it was ultimately sold to NBC-owned KNBC (channel 4), which flew the Telecopter with pilot Francis Gary Powers and cameraman George Spears until it crashed on August 1, 1977, killing the two on board.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, under the final years of ownership under Paramount Pictures, KTLA launched \"am:LA\", a one-hour morning news program anchored by Stan Chambers, and with it, it was the first extended morning newscast in Southern California. Before eventually launching a 10:00 p.m. newscast in 1965, originally titled \"Newscene\" (also known over the years as \"The George Putnam News\", \"NewsWatch\", \"Channel 5/KTLA News at Ten\" and \"KTLA Prime News\"), KTLA had its weeknight evening newscasts airing at 7 and 11 pm, with the latter in direct competition with the network-owned local newscasts on KNXT (now KCBS-TV), KRCA-TV (now KNBC) and KABC-TV. Traditionally, the evening news programs are often serious and no-nonsense in nature and has received many journalism awards. Putnam and fellow KTLA news anchors Hal Fishman and Larry McCormick became icons in Los Angeles television news over the years. Accompanying his news anchoring career, McCormick also hosted \"Making It!\", a public affairs program on the station which featured stories on the entrepreneurial successes of ethnic minorities. Its veteran field reporters have included 62-year KTLA veteran Stan Chambers and Warren Wilson. Stu Nahan, Keith Olbermann and Ed Arnold (former anchor of KOCE-TV's \"Real Orange\") formerly served as sports anchors.\n\nIn March 1991, KTLA was the first station to air the infamous video of Rodney King's beating by three Los Angeles police officers, whose eventual acquittal sparked rioting within the city in 1992. In July 1991, KTLA debuted the Los Angeles market's first live, local morning two-hour newscast, the \"KTLA Morning News\", to compete with the network morning shows on KABC-TV (channel 7), KCBS-TV (channel 2) and KNBC (which each started at 7:00 a.m., as KTLA's program initially did). The program suffered from low ratings at first; however, the ability to cover breaking news live (as opposed to the network morning programs, which were aired on a three-hour tape delay) attracted more viewers to the program. As time went on, the \"Morning News\" has enjoyed great ratings success, generally ranking number one in its main 7:00–9:00 a.m. time period. The program's success spawned rival KTTV to launch its own morning newscast, \"Good Day L.A.\", in 1993. From 1994 to 1995, the station aired gavel to gavel coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial anchored by Marta Waller (this coverage was rebroadcast by other stations such as Portland, Oregon WB affiliate [and future Tribune sister station] KWBP (now KRCW-TV)).\n\nThe station debuted a midday newscast at noon in 1995, which later moved to 11:00 a.m. the following year, which lasted less than two years before it was canceled in 1997. In recent years, KTLA's newscasts have become more tabloid-based in nature, perhaps to compete with KTTV (both stations have rivaled each other in the ratings for many years). With this, KTLA has placed more emphasis on entertainment news and has featured personalities such as Mindy Burbano Stearns, Zorianna Kitt, Ross King and most recently Jessica Holmes as entertainment reporters. In 2004, KTLA debuted a segment on its morning newscast titled \"The Audition,\" in which several actors and actresses competed for a role as weathercaster on its 10:00 p.m. newscast. Ross King was the winner of the first installment, followed by Jessica Holmes as the winner of the second installment (Holmes now serves as co-anchor of the 7:00–11:00 a.m. weekday block of the \"KTLA Morning News\").\n\nOn January 13, 2007, KTLA became the second television station in the Los Angeles market (after KABC-TV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On July 30, 2007, Hal Fishman anchored what would be his final newscast for KTLA. Following several days of hospitalization for a liver infection, Fishman died on August 7, 2007. KTLA's newscasts that day were dedicated to Fishman, for whom the station dedicated its news studio in 2000. After Fishman's passing, longtime \"Morning Show\" co-host Carlos Amezcua became the interim co-anchor on the 10:00 p.m. newscast. Local media speculated that Amezcua would be named full-time anchor of the primetime newscast; however, on September 4, Amezcua announced his departure from KTLA to replace John Beard as co-anchor of KTTV's 10:00 p.m. newscast. Morning co-anchor Emmett Miller took over as interim evening anchor and was named as Fishman's permanent replacement on December 4.\n\nAfter former KCBS/KCAL general manager Don Corsini was appointed as KTLA's president and general manager in January 2009, the station spearheaded an expansion of its news programming that year. On January 19, KTLA soft-launched a nightly half-hour 6:30 p.m. newscast (the market's first since KCAL-TV and KCBS-TV ran newscasts in that slot – KCBS's being part of an hour-long 6:00 p.m. newscast – during the mid-1990s, prior to CBS's 2002 purchase of KCAL). Then on April 1, 2009, the \"KTLA Morning News\" was expanded by a half-hour to start at 4:30 a.m. and an hour-long midday newscast at 1:00 p.m. debuted. On April 4, the weekend edition of the 6:30 p.m. newscast expanded to a full hour at 6:00 p.m., with the 6:30 p.m. weekday newscasts following suit that September. Shortly afterward, KTLA expanded the station's traffic reports to the afternoon and evening newscasts (the weekday edition of the \"Morning News\" utilizes a dedicated traffic anchor, while traffic reports for all other newscasts are done by channel 5's on-air weather staff).\n\nIn April 2011, KTLA added weekend morning newscasts (an hour-long newscast at 6:00 a.m. on Saturdays, which expanded to two hours at 5:00 a.m. in September 2012 and a three-hour Sunday newscast at 6:00 a.m.; the Saturday morning edition aired in the earlier timeslot due to The CW's \"Vortexx\" animation block). In August 2011, KTLA added a two-hour primetime newscast titled the \"KTLA 5 Sunday Edition\" from 8:00–10:00 p.m. on Sunday evenings, leading into that night's 10:00 p.m. newscast (the 8:00 hour of the program was later dropped in September 2013, while the 9:00 hour moved to 7:00 p.m. on October 7, 2018 to accommodate the return of The CW's Sunday night two-hour prime time block). On February 2, 2012, KTLA expanded the weekday edition of the \"KTLA Morning News\" to begin at 4:00 a.m.\n\nOn May 9, 2014, the Saturday morning newscast was expanded to three hours and moved to 6:00–9:00 a.m., in a uniform timeslot as the Sunday morning newscast, causing The CW's children's program block at the time, \"Vortexx\", to be aired to a two-hour tape delay (that broadcast expanded to four hours from 6:00–10:00 a.m. on August 6, 2016, further aligning it with the prior expansion of the Sunday morning newscast into the same four-hour slot on July 5, 2015 and pushing the successor One Magnificent Morning block back by an additional hour). The following month on June 16, KTLA quietly \"soft launched\" a half-hour nightly newscast at 11:00 p.m. without any promotion (becoming Tribune's first news-producing CW affiliate to carry a newscast in the traditional late news timeslot), its first regularly-scheduled 11 pm newscast since 1965.\n\nOn December 26, 2014, KTLA added separate hour-long, weekday afternoon newscasts at 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. The creation of the three-hour mid-afternoon news block—which expanded upon the existing 1:00 p.m. newscast—was in response to CBS Television Stations' December 10 announcement that it would discontinue KCAL-TV's newscasts at 2:00 and 3:00 late that month to refocus newsgathering resources towards KCAL's 4:00 p.m. newscast and the respective evening newscasts on KCAL and sister station KCBS-TV. While the 3:00 broadcast was a permanent addition, the 2:00 p.m. newscast was intended as a temporary fill-in that ran until December 31, 2014 (it was replaced two days later on January 2, 2015, by a double-run of \"Celebrity Name Game\"). In July 2015, KTLA became the first television station in Los Angeles to carry live audio simulcasts of its newscasts on the iHeartRadio app.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, KTLA expanded the weekday edition of the \"KTLA Morning News\" to 11:00 a.m.\n\nOn January 6, 2018, KTLA expanded the weekend edition of the \"KTLA Morning News\" to 11:00 a.m.\n\nOn May 1, 2018, KTLA debuted an hour long newscast at 11:00 a.m.\n\nOn October 7, 2018, KTLA moved its \"Sunday Edition\" up two hours earlier to 7:00 p.m. due to The CW adding primetime programming on Sundays.\n\nOn December 27, 2018, KTLA \"Weekend News\" anchor and reporter, Chris Burrous, was found unconscious from a methamphetamine overdose in a Days Inn hotel room in Glendale, California. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.\n\nOn February 9, 2019, KTLA added a new hour-long 5 p.m. weekend newscast.\n\n\n\nKTLA is rebroadcast on the following translator stations:\n\n\n"}

Kuitun is located between Wusu and Shihezi on the railway from Ürümqi to Kazakhstan, close to a desert.\n\nThe city was historically associated with the 7th Xinjiang Agriculture Construction Division (), which had run it until 1975, and still continues to administer the city's Tianbei New Area.\n\nLocal industries include food processing and textile industries, as well as Kuitun Power Plant.\n\nThe name of \"Kuytun\" () was from the Mongolian language, meaning \"extreme cold\" (). The name of \"Kuiteng\" (), which firstly appeared in the official historical book \"History of Yuan\" (), was the present Kuytun River. According to legend, in the period of Mongolian Westward Expansion, Genghis Khan' troops once stationed in the place, when it was very cold in winter, his soldiers shouted \"Kuitun\", since that time, the place was named after \"Kuytun\".\n\nAt the latest in the 3rd century BC (Qin dynasty), the Saka people appeared in the place of present Kuytun area. This was followed by the Great Yuezhi people and then the Usans.\n\nKuytun was part of Protectorate of the Western Regions (59 BC) in the Han period. During the period of the Jin, Sixteen Kingdoms and Northern and Southern dynasties, it was part of \"Ruipan State\" (), then that was followed by the Northern Wei, Rouran and then the First Turkic Khaganate. It was the territory of \"Tyueles\" () in Western Turk in the Sui period and of \"Kunling Commandery\" () in the Tang period. It was part of Toquz Oghuz () and it was followed by Liao State in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The place was within the territory of Mongol \"Qurzh\" () in the period of Genghis Khan (1206 - 1227), and as part of the fiefdom of \"Chagatai Khan' Descendants\" () between 1306 - 1330. As the pastureland of Oirats (), it was under the administration of \"Kurkalawusu\" () of Dzungars in the Qing period. When Xinjiang Province was found in 1884, the army camps () and fortress () in the province were changed into military posts \n(), \"Kuytun Post\" () was one of that in those days.\n\nThe territory was \"Kuytun Divion\" (\"Kuitunzhuang\", ), one of nine divisions in Wusu County () in 1913. In 1945, Wusu County was divided into four minggans (administrative Division below the county, ), Kuytun was one of that. The minggan of Kuytun had five centenarii () of Kuytun (), Bayingou (), Jiujianlou (), Huanggong () and Bashisihu () under its administration. The \"security police station\" () was found in Kuytun in 1948.\n\nIn August 1950, the administrative division of minggan in Wusu County was transformed into a district, and a centenarii into a township. Kuytun was the 1st township of the 2nd district in Wusu County, and it had five unincorporated villages of Huanggou (), Tashikuitun (), Kalasu (), Diankuitun () and Kaiganqi () under its administration.\n\nIn the further adjustment of administrative divisions in March 1954, Kuytun became the 1st township of the 1st district of Wusu County. In early 1957, The three townships of Kuytun (), Bashisihu () and Jiujianlou () were amalgamated into Xinfu Township (). In March 1957, the 7th Division of XPCC () moved its headquarters to Kuytun from Paotai ().\n\nIn July 1958, Kuytun was incorporated to Karamay from Wushi County. On March 25, 1975, the XPCC was withdrawn, the 7th Division with agriculture and animal husbandry farms, and its owned industrial enterprises were devolved to the local administration. On August 29, 1975, the county-level city of Kuytun was approved to establish from Karamay by the State Council, and it was under administration of Ili Autonomous Prefecture. On September 10 of the same year, Kuitun City was officially established and the seat of Ili Autonomous Prefecture was moved to Kuytun from Yining. Based on agriculture and animal husbandry farms, and industrial enterprises owned by the 7th Division of XPCC, \"Kuytun Bureau of Farms and Land Reclamation\" () was incorporated in July 1978. Kuytun City and the \"Kuytun Bureau of Farms and Land Reclamation\" were implemented a team with two brands. The seat of Ili Autonomous Prefecture was moved back to Yining from Kuytun in October 1979.\n\nThe XPCC was approved to restore in December 1981. Based on the \"Kuytun Bureau of Farms and Land Reclamation\" which was revoked, the \"7th Division of XPCC\" () was restored in April 1982. The 7th Division of XPCC and local government of Kuytun City are independent of each other, the 7th Division of XPCC is under unified command of XPCC meanwhile Kuytun City is under the administration of Ili Autonomous Prefecture.\n\nThe city of Kuytun is located in the middle northwest of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with a north latitude of 44 degrees 19 degrees - 44 degrees 49 degrees and an east longitude of 84 degrees 47 degrees - 85 degrees 18 degrees.

{"id": "2074411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074411", "title": "Franco Battiato", "text": "Franco Battiato\n\nFrancesco \"Franco\" Battiato (; born 23 March 1945) is an Italian singer-songwriter, composer, filmmaker and, under the pseudonym Süphan Barzani, also a painter. Battiato's songs contain esoteric, philosophical and religious themes, and have spanned genres such as experimental pop, electronic music, progressive rock, and new wave.\n\nHe is and has been for decades one of the most popular singer-songwriters in Italy. His unique sound, song-crafting and especially his lyrics, often containing philosophical, religious, and culturally exotic references, as well as tackling or painting universal themes about the human condition earned him a unique spot on Italy's music scene, and the nickname of \"Il Maestro\" (\"The Master\" or \"The Teacher\"). His work includes songwriting and joint production efforts with several Italian and international musicians and pop singers, including the long-lasting professional relationship with Italian singer Alice. Together with Alice, Battiato represented Italy at the 1984 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"I treni di Tozeur\".\n\nAfter graduating from high school at the Liceo Scientifico \"Archimede\" in Acireale, and following the death of his father (truck driver and longshoreman in New York), in 1964 he moved first to Rome.\nFranco Battiato moved to Milan at age 22, and soon after won his first musical contract.\n\nHis single, \"La Torre\", was released and Battiato appeared on TV to perform the song. He scored some success with the romantic song \"È l'amore\". After further covers of pop songs, he met the experimental musician Juri Camisasca in 1970 and collaborated with , an Italian psychedelic-progressive rock band. As a solo artist, he released the science-fiction single \"La convenzione\" (\"The convention\"), one of the finest Italian progressive rock songs of the 1970s.\n\nStarting from 1971, Battiato devoted much of his efforts to experimental electronic music, producing a series of LPs that remained almost unknown at the time, but are now eagerly sought by collectors worldwide. Starting out with electronic progressive rock with some emphasis on vocals, his music became increasingly experimental, gradually moving into the realms of musique concrète and minimalism: \"Foetus\" (1971, its cover was censored), \"Pollution\" (1972), \"Sulle Corde di Aries\" (1973), \"Clic\" (1974) and \"M.elle le “Gladiator”\" (1975).\n\nIn 1975, he moved to the Dischi Ricordi label, producing \"Battiato\" (1975), \"Juke Box\" (1976) and the experimental \"L'Egitto prima delle sabbie\" (Egypt Before the Sands, 1977), which won the Stockhausen award for contemporary music. \n\nAfter the Ricordi label failed to re-sign him, Battiato signed with EMI. He abandoned the prog rock experiments of the previous years and moved to a more pop-oriented style which afforded him ever increasing popularity with Italian audiences. In this period his albums were usually in collaboration with the renowned musician and violinist Giusto Pio, whose two later albums were produced by Battiato. \n\nAfter \"L'era del cinghiale bianco\" (The Era of the White Boar, 1979). Patriots was released, and it was his first LP of the 80s. That album was successful enough to reach the thirtieth position on the charts. It contains a few songs which have become Battiato's classics, such as \"Le Aquile\" (The Eagles), and \"Prospettiva Nevskij\" (Nevsky Prospect). This new era of his music marks the beginning of his collaboration with the singer Alice and the violinist Giusto Pio. His following LP was \"La Voce del Padrone\" (His Masters Voice). He had even more success with this album than with \"Patriots\". His compositions sound both elegant, yet easy to listen to. This was the key to his growing fan base, of course. \"La Voce del Padrone\" contains lots of songs which became classics of Italian music. It stayed in the number one position for six months, becoming the first Italian LP with more than one million copies sold. His commercial success was confirmed by \"L'arca di Noè\" (\"Noah's Ark\") in 1982. Songs such as \"L'era del cinghiale bianco\", \"Prospettiva Nevskij\" (\"Nevsky Prospekt\"), \"Centro di gravità permanente\" (\"Permanent Gravity Centrepoint\"), \"Bandiera bianca\" (\"White Flag\"), and \"Voglio vederti danzare\" (\"I Want To See You Dance\") established Battiato in Italy. \"Orizzonti perduti\" (\"Lost Horizons\", 1983), which Battiato himself called \"a kipper\", was followed by the successful \"Mondi Lontanissimi\" (\"Faraway Worlds\", 1985), which featured a solo version of the popular \"I treni di Tozeur\" (\"The Tozeur Trains)\", originally a duet with Alice performed at the 1984 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n1988's \"Fisiognomica\" (\"Physiognomy\") sold more than 300,000 copies and it confirmed Battiato's success. The album, considered by Battiato himself his best work for the balance between music and lyrics, contained the hit \"Nomadi\" (\"Nomads\"), originally recorded by Alice and written by his old friend Juri Camisasca, who in the meantime had retired to a Benedictin monastery. The album also included the songs \"E ti vengo a cercare\", which was performed by director/actor Nanni Moretti in his 1989 movie \"Palombella Rossa\", and \"Veni l'autunnu\" with lyrics entirely in the Sicilian and Arabic languages. \nIn 2013 he signed a publishing deal with Roberto Mancinelli and Sony/ATV Music Publishing.\n\nHe carried on making albums, mixing electronic and classical sounds. In the middle of the 90s he started a collaboration with the Sicilian philosopher Manglio Sgalambro, and most of the songs which were written in that period were really complicated, either in terms of the style or the text. However, the LP \"L'imboscata\", issued in 1996, contained \"La Cura\" (\"The Cure\"), one of the best songs he has ever written, based on its popularity. Afterwards, he explored rock with \"Gommalacca\" (1998), which contains heavier rock sounds in which electric guitars played a bigger role. \n\nIn 1994 Battiato began to collaborate with the Sicilian philosopher Manlio Sgalambro, who was to write almost all the lyrics of his following albums. After the tentative \"L'ombrello e la macchina da cucire\" of 1995, in 1996 the duo published what is considered their best work so far, \"L'imboscata\", containing the romantic hit \"La cura\" (\"The care\"), elected best Italian song of the year. \"Gommalacca\" (1998, with an unusual stress on hard rock), \"Ferro battuto\" (2000) and \"Dieci stratagemmi\" (2004) continued on the same path, with variations mainly set by Battiato's unceasing desire for musical experimentation. \n\nIn 2003 Battiato released his first feature film, \"Perduto amor\" (Lost love), for which he also composed the soundtrack. The movie won the Silver Ribbon for the best debutant director. However, heavy criticism struck against his following movie, \"Musikanten\", a rather experimental work about Beethoven's last four years of life. The German musician was played by the Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky. In November 2012 he accepted an offer from newly elected Sicilian regional president Rosario Crocetta to become the new Regional Minister for Tourism and Culture, announcing he will not take any compensation for the job, but was subsequently fired soon after his controversial claim that there were \"troie in Parlamento\" (whores within Parliament). \n\nTen years later, he issued \"Fleurs 1, Fleurs 3, and Fleurs 2, one after the other, in that specific order. They contained well-made covers taken from the most important Italian singers. He continued with his music, balanced between pop and electronic, until 2010. He had been touring with Alice for the whole of 2016, but in 2017 he held his last concert in Catania. He would have continued his work, but he had to give up for health reasons. At the end of 2019, his manager announced his definitive retirement from the scene. \n\nBattiato is vegetarian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They lived originally north of the Rhine in the area of the modern border between Germany and the Netherlands, but then moved southwards in the 4th century, as a Frankish tribe living on both sides of the Rhine.\n\nAccording to Velleius Paterculus, in 4 AD, the emperor Tiberius crossed the Rhine, first attacking a tribe which commentators interpret variously as the Cananefates or Chamavi, both being in the area of the modern Netherlands, then the Chattuari, and then the Bructeri between Ems and Lippe, somewhere to the north of the modern Ruhr district in Germany. This implies that the Chattuari lived somewhere in the west of Westphalia.\n\nStrabo mentions the Chattuari as one of the non-nomadic northern Germanic tribes in a group along with the Cherusci, the Chatti, and the Gamabrivii. (He also contrasted with other non nomadic tribes supposedly near the Ocean, the Sugambri, the \"Chaubi\", the Bructeri, and the Cimbri, \"and also the Cauci, the Caülci, the Campsiani\".) Strabo also notes them as one of the tribes who allied under the Cherusci and were made poor after being defeated by Germanicus. They apparently appeared at his triumph in 17 AD along with the Caülci, Campsani, Bructeri, Usipi, Cherusci, Chatti, Landi, and Tubattii.\n\nThere is no consensus on any connection between the Chattuarii and either the similar-sounding Chatti or, less likely, the Chasuarii, who both lived in a similar region of Germany, and are also mentioned in Roman era texts.\n\nThe Chattuari appear again in the historical record in the 4th century, living on the Rhine amongst the first tribes to be known as Franks. Ammianus Marcellinus reports that Emperor Julian, crossed the Rhine border from Xanten and...entered the district belonging to a Frank tribe, called the Attuarii, men of a turbulent character, who at that very moment were licentiously plundering the districts of Gaul. He attacked them unexpectedly while they were apprehensive of no hostile measures, but were reposing in fancied security, relying on the ruggedness and difficulty of the roads which led into their country, and which no prince within their recollection had ever penetrated.\n\nSome of them (laeti) were also settled in France \"pagus attuariorum\" (French; Atuyer, comprising Oscheret at that time) south of Langres in the 3rd century.\n\nUnder the Franks, the name of the Chattuari was used for what became two early medieval gaus on either side of the ride, north of the Ripuarian Franks, whose capital was in Cologne. The eastern side, they were near the Ruhr river, and across the Rhine they settled near the Niers river, between Maas and Rhine, where the Romans had much earlier settled the Germanic Cugerni. This western gau (Dutch: \"Hettergouw\", German: \"Hattuarien\") is mentioned in the Treaty of Meerssen, in the year 870 AD.\n\nThe Chattuarii may also appear in the poem Beowulf as \"Hetwaras\" where they appear to form a league together with the Hugas (who may be the Chauci) and the Frisians to fight against a Geatish raiding force from Denmark. The Geats are defeated and their king Hygelac is killed, Beowulf alone escaping. According to Widsith, the \"Hætwera\" were ruled by Hun.\n\n"}

He is the lead guitarist for the American hard rock band Kiss, and was lead guitarist for the band Black 'n Blue.\n\nThomas Cunningham Thayer was born on November 7, 1960, in Portland, Oregon, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Beaverton, Oregon. His mother Patricia Thayer (née Cunningham) was a classically trained violinist and singer, and father James Thayer (1922–2018) was a businessman, community leader and retired brigadier general in the US Army.\n\nEarly on, Thayer was raised in a musical family with three brothers and a sister amidst sounds that ranged from classical to the Beatles and other classic 1960s pop music. Thayer's passion for early 1970s hard rock bands drove his desire to pick up electric guitar at age 13. After graduating from Sunset High School in 1978, Thayer played in many local garage and club bands, eventually forming his own group with singer Jaime St. James, which eventually took the name Black 'n Blue.\n\nFormed in November 1981, Black 'n Blue played gigs in the Portland area for over a year before making a move to Southern California in early 1983. Black 'n Blue had immediate success as a top draw in Hollywood's rock clubs, and within six months signed a major worldwide recording contract with Geffen Records.\n\nThe band traveled to Germany in early 1984 to work with Scorpions producer Dieter Dierks, releasing \"Black 'n Blue\" in August 1984, featuring the songs \"Hold on to 18\" and \"School of Hard Knocks,\" both co-written by Thayer and St. James. The follow-up Bruce Fairbairn-produced album, \"Without Love\", was released in 1985 with Thayer, St. James and Jim Vallance co-writing the single \"Miss Mystery.\" After touring for two months as opening act for Kiss in fall 1985, Black 'n Blue hired Kiss bassist Gene Simmons to produce the band's next studio album \"Nasty Nasty\", released in 1986 and \"In Heat\" in 1988. The band subsequently broke up in late 1988.\n\nAlthough no longer a permanent member of the band, Thayer has performed periodically with the other original members of Black 'n Blue for several one-off reunion and benefit concerts. In October 2010, the band was inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame in Portland, with all five members of the classic lineup (including Thayer) attending.\n\nJohn Kalodner from Geffen Records invited Thayer to play on Jimmy Barnes' Australian album \"For The Working Class Man\" (released outside the Australian market as \"Jimmy Barnes\"). Both Barnes and Thayer's group Black 'n Blue were signed to Geffen. The album was recorded in Los Angeles and New York in 1984-85. When interviewed some years later he recalled that the two sessions he played on included Mick Fleetwood on drums, and Billy Burnette on guitar.\n\nIn 1989, Thayer co-wrote songs with Gene Simmons and played session guitar on song demos for Kiss' 1989 release, \"Hot in the Shade\", which includes the Simmons and Thayer songs \"Betrayed\" and \"The Street Giveth, The Street Taketh Away\". That same year, Thayer recorded guitar tracks for singer-songwriter Teresa Straley and producer Pat Regan's record deal with Reprise Records.\n\nThayer co-produced and played guitar on Doro Pesch's 1991 Polygram Records release, \"Doro\". In 1992, Thayer joined Los Angeles rock band Shake the Faith and recorded the album \"America the Violent\", which was released in Japan in 1994. Thayer persuaded journalist Hunter S. Thompson to create the original artwork for the album cover. Thayer and other members of Shake the Faith continued in the band No. 9, which recorded a 12 album for Elektra Records that was never released. The No. 9 album included a cover of Elvis Costello's \"Alison\".\n\nIn 1994, Kiss' Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley hired Thayer to work part-time on their forthcoming book \"Kisstory\", which led to other projects and eventually a full-time role with Kiss. Thayer's work for Stanley and Simmons began by performing such tasks as painting Stanley's house and cleaning out Simmons' gutters.\n\nThayer managed the 1995 Worldwide Kiss Convention tour and the Kiss \"MTV Unplugged\" concert. In preparation for 1996's Kiss Alive/Worldwide Tour, Thayer worked with guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss, to help them relearn their original guitar and drum parts from the 1970s. Thayer worked as producer and editor of Kiss' long form video and film releases including: \"Kiss, The Second Coming\" in 1998, New Line Cinema's feature \"Detroit Rock City\" in 1998, and Showtime Television's pay-per-view, \"The Last Kiss\" in 2000.\n\nBy 2002 and with the growing uncertainty of Ace Frehley's involvement in the band, Thayer stood by for a Kiss performance at the 2002 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony in Salt Lake City to fill-in on lead guitar if necessary. One month later Thayer got the call and donned the Spaceman makeup for the first time, filling in and performing onstage with Kiss at a private concert in Trelawny, Jamaica. Several TV appearances followed in 2002 including ABC's \"Dick Clark's American Bandstand 50th Anniversary Show\" and \"That 70s Show\" on Fox.\n\nAfter the 2002 performance in Trelawny, Jamaica, Thayer became the lead guitarist for Kiss. In 2003 Thayer with Kiss joined forces with the 70-piece Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (all in Kiss makeup) for a concert at the Telstra Dome in Melbourne Australia. Recorded and filmed in front of 40,000 fans, a pay-per-view, \"\" CD and DVD were released worldwide later in the year. In 2004 Thayer produced the RIAA double-platinum selling DVD set, \"Rock the Nation Live!\", released worldwide in 2005.\n\n\"Sonic Boom\", the first Kiss studio album in 11 years, was released worldwide in October 2009, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard magazine album chart. Thayer co-wrote three songs on the record, including his own lead vocal debut on \"When Lightning Strikes.”\n\nA new Kiss studio album, titled \"Monster\", was released in October 2012; Thayer co-wrote 10 songs and sang lead vocal on \"Outta This World\". Thayer produced \"Kiss Rocks Vegas\", a Kiss live album and DVD released on August 26, 2016, commemorating the band's November 2014 residency at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas) during their 40th anniversary tour.\n\nThayer's Epiphone Les Paul signature model \"Spaceman\" guitar was officially released on January 1, 2013. In October, Epiphone announced the first run of 1,000 guitars had sold-out.He uses Seymour Duncan pickups and inspired by Jimmy Page, each signature guitar has the neck pickup covered and the bridge uncovered.\n\nJanuary 1, 2015 saw the release of Thayer's second Epiphone signature model, the \"White Lightning\" Les Paul. \"My new White Lightning signature model is the pinnacle of looks, style and flash,” Thayer stated, “I'm proud to put my name on a serious guitar that can be enjoyed at home or rock the biggest stages in the world.\" In December 2016 Epiphone announced the 1,500 guitar limited edition run had sold-out.\n\nEpiphone released the third Tommy Thayer signature model guitar, the \"White Lightning\" Explorer in Fall 2017. \"My Epiphone signature guitars are a tried and true part of my arsenal. I never leave home without 'em!\" says Thayer.\n\nThayer was elected to the board of trustees at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, in September 2005. He continues to serve on the board in 2019.\n\nThrough 2006 and 2007, Thayer arranged for new musical instruments to be donated to jump-start ailing school band programs in Oregon. In February 2010, Thayer and Kiss were featured in ABC's \"\" helping a family in need with new instruments for their home-based, non-profit music school.\n\nKiss headlined Rockin' the Corps, an outdoor concert in 2005 at Camp Pendleton, California dedicated to US Marines and US Military personnel stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In March 2007, Thayer and Gene Simmons visited the Marines of Camp Pendleton again with a rally and live performance featuring a medley of the armed forces anthems; it was filmed for an hour-long \"Gene Simmons Family Jewels\" TV special on A&E that aired on Memorial Day 2007.\n\nThayer donates all royalties earned from sales of his Hughes & Kettner signature guitar amplifier to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles to support of the important medical needs of sick and injured children. In 2012, Thayer was actively involved in the organization of the fundraising event \"All-Star Salute to the Oregon Military\", on May 18 at the Oregon Golf Club in West Linn, Oregon. The event was the kick-off of the five-year $20 million capital campaign to raise funds in support of the new Oregon Military Museum that will be named in honor of Thayer's father, Brigadier General James B. Thayer Sr.\n\nThe 2014 \"All-Star Salute to the Oregon Military\" organized by Thayer, raised $1.2 million in one night for the museum campaign. The exclusive summer party at a private residence in Lake Oswego, Oregon featured an appearance and acoustic set by Kiss. Thayer organized a similar event in 2017, with funds raised being donated to the development of the Oregon Military Museum.\n\nIn 2016, Thayer along with his brother Jim Thayer Jr and Amy Maxwell, formed the Oregon Military Museum Project (OMMP), a 501(c)(3) organization representing the private fundraising for the Oregon Military Museum. Thayer is currently President of the OMMP. The museum is called \"The Brigadier General James B. Thayer Oregon Military Museum.\"\n\nAt its May 2018 commencement, Pacific University honored Thayer with an honorary doctorate of humane letters \"in recognition of his tremendous career and philanthropic leadership efforts.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Reinfection by tuberculosis via the skin, therefore, can result from accidental exposure to human tuberculous tissue in physicians, pathologists and laboratory workers; or to tissues of other infected animals, in veterinarians, butchers, etc.\n\nTVC is one of the many forms of cutaneous tuberculosis, such as the tuberculous chancre (which results from the cutaneous inoculation in immunocompetent people without previous exposure), and the reactivation cutaneous tuberculosis (the most common form, which appears in previously infected patients). Other forms of cutaneous tuberculosis are: lupus vulgaris, scrofuloderma, lichen scrofulosorum, erythema induratum and the papulonecrotic tuberculid.\n\nIt was described by René Laennec in 1826.\n\nBecause the TVC's entry point usually is the site of a trauma, wound or puncture in the skin (during an autopsy, for example), the most frequent site for the wart are the hands. But it can occur anywhere in the skin, such as in the sole of the feet, in the anus, and, in the case of children from developing countries, in the buttocks and knees. This is because children from countries of high incidence of tuberculosis can contract the lesion after contact with tuberculous sputum, by walking barefoot, sitting or playing on the ground.\n\nWhen recent, the skin lesion has the outside appearance of a wart or verruca, thus it can be confused with other kinds of warts. It evolves to an annular red-brown plaque with time, with central healing and gradual expansion in the periphery. In this phase, it can be confused with fungal infections such as blastomycosis and chromoblastomycosis.\nThe diagnosis is confirmed by a skin biopsy and a positive culture for acid-fast bacilli. A PPD test may also result positive.\n\nTherapy for cutaneous tuberculosis is the same as for systemic tuberculosis, and usually consists of a 4-drug regimen, i.e., isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin.\n\n\nGoldman, G.; Bolognia, J.L.

Around that time (1809), he married Anne Dyke, the sister of tragedienne Mary Ann Duff, but she died soon after the marriage. He managed the \"Theatre Royal\" by the \"North Bridge\", at first jointly with Henry Siddons (son of Sarah Siddons), then after 1816 on his own.\n\nHe was the son of the actor and dramatist Charles Murray, and grandson of the Jacobite Sir John Murray of Broughton who, when captured after the Battle of Culloden, saved his life by betraying his fellow Jacobites then lived out his life in Edinburgh as a haunted and hated figure. Walter Scott's father as a lawyer had professional dealings with the old man, but on one occasion after his wife brought tea, he afterwards threw the cup out the window saying, \"Neither lip of me nor of mine comes after Murray of Broughton's.\" This incident may have later contributed to Scott's antiquarian interest in the family and friendship with William Henry Murray. 10 June 1818 saw the first performance of Murray's operatic adaption of Walter Scott's novel \"Rob Roy\". It was titled \"Rob Roy MacGregor\".\n\nWhen Scott was preparing for the visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 he was quick to draw on Murray's expertise for the management of events. Murray created the settings at various venues, contrived the \"revived ancient dresses\" and arranged the \"traditional\" pageants. He was particularly acclaimed for his success in transforming the Assembly Rooms in George Street into a theatrical palace for the Peers' \"Grand Ball\", an event that was pivotal in making the tartan kilt which had been thought of as the primitive dress of mountain thieves into the national dress of the whole of Scotland. The King's last and least formal public appearance during the visit to Edinburgh was at a theatre performance of Scott's Rob Roy adapted and produced by Murray.\n\nHe died in St Andrews on 5 May 1852 and is buried against the eastern wall of St Andrew's Cathedral churchyard, backing onto the Eastern Cemetery.\n\n"}
{"id": "2074434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074434", "title": "Masajiro Miyazaki", "text": "Masajiro Miyazaki\n\nMasajiro Miyazaki, CM (November 24, 1899 – July 23, 1984) was a Japanese-Canadian osteopathic physician who practised in Vancouver prior to World War II. During World War II, he was appointed as a coroner by the British Columbia Provincial Police in the town of Lillooet, British Columbia. In addition to coroner's duties he also served as effective general practitioner in the Lillooet area, including for the area's four wartime \"self-supporting centres\". Miyazaki's practice also included the Japanese Canadian internment camp at Taylor Lake. Towards the end of his life, Miyazaki was recognized for his services to the community, which included founding the local ambulance service and instigating a proper hospital for Lillooet, by being enrolled in the Order of Canada.\n\nMiyazaki was born in the vicinity of Hikone City in Japan and moved to Canada in 1913 with his father. Graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1925, he was unable to pursue medical training in Canada due to laws preventing post-secondary study by Japanese Canadians and pursued study in the United States, at the Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery in Missouri, graduating in 1929. Dr. Miyazaki received his licence to practise from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia but pursued further training in Los Angeles, ultimately opening an office in Vancouver in 1930. During his time in Vancouver he was active in Japanese Canadian community affairs, and served as treasurer of the Canadian Japanese Association from 1938 to 1941.\n\nFollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese Empire on December 7, 1941, wartime paranoia led to the forced evacuation of Japanese and Canadians of Japanese ancestry away from the British Columbia coast to the province's interior and beyond to other provinces farther east.\nOne of the sites chosen for these relocations was a semi-abandoned hydroelectric-development village at Shalalth (then known as Bridge River), one of them at East Lillooet in the Fraser Canyon, across the Fraser River from the town of Lillooet; Miyazaki was first relocated to Bridge River and then upon his appointment as coroner was moved to the town of Lillooet. Other sites in the area were at Minto City, McGillivray Falls. These were not fenced internment camps, like the infamous one at Tashme, and mostly included family groups who had been able to \"buy\" a better situation in the Interior, with some chance of work, although comings-and-goings were still regulated by police and permits.\nMany of the Japanese at the \"Bridge River\" townsite worked for the Pacific Great Eastern Railway and the cartage companies, while those at McGillivray Falls relocated to nearby Devine to work in a sawmill. At Lillooet, the presence of the Japanese helped keep the wartime merchant economy going, and the Japanese interest in market gardening helped rebirth the valley's small produce industry.\n\nOne of the relocatees at Bridge River was Masajiro Miyazaki, a Canadian-trained osteopath whose practice had been thriving in Vancouver before the war. When the town of Lillooet's doctor died and a wartime replacement was not to be had to perform autopsies, the town's provincial costabulary recruited Miyazaki to act in the capacity of coroner.\n\nSpecial permits were created to allow him to stay in Lillooet instead of at Bridge River. This position quickly evolved into that of all-around town-and-country doctor, dentist and obstetrician, with patients throughout the whole region from Pemberton-Mount Currie to Pavilion and Lytton.\n\nMiyazaki's practice also included the Japanese-Canadian internment camp at Taylor Lake, northeast of 70 Mile House, a long distance away via the tortuous roads of the Fraser Canyon and the Thompson Canyon. His autobiography, \"My Sixty Years In Canada\", contains many accounts of harrowing trips on mountain roads and rail lines in difficult weather and adverse conditions.\n\nMiyazaki was invited to use as his surgery and residence Longford House, a late 19th-century manor near the main street owned by one of the town's oldest families (see Caspar Phair). Like many of the relocated Japanese in this district, Miyazaki stayed on after the war and became a major community leader during the 1950s, leading the campaign for a local ambulance service and proper hospital — despite longstanding resistance from the provincial medical establishment over his qualifications, as he was only an osteopath and not a medical doctor.\n\nIn 1983, after Miyazaki donated the property to the community when he left Lillooet that year, Longford House was renamed Miyazaki House . The house remains open as a heritage site for tours and still exhibits Miyazaki's office as he left it. His office still contains all original articles, including surgical instruments, medical texts, and skeletal displays. The house also has displays of local artwork and the history of the house before Miyazaki moved there.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Miyazaki was recognized for his services to the community by being enrolled in the Order of Canada, an honour shared by one of Lillooet's other notable citizens, Kansas-born Margaret Lally \"Ma\" Murray.\n\nHis Order of Canada commendation reads:\n\nC.M. (Member) December 15, 1976 April 20, 1977\n\nMiyazaki died of an infection in Kamloops, British Columbia on July 23, 1984.\n\n\n\n"}

Kerr's father worked as a firefighter on rafts along the Mississippi. Prior to playing baseball, Kerr competed in amateur boxing. \n\nKerr married Cora (nicknamed \"Pep\") Downing at age 21, on July 7, 1914. The couple remained married until Kerr's death in 1963.\n\nKerr started playing baseball 14 alongside amateur adult baseball players.\n\nIn 1909, Kerr and one of his brothers joined the Paragould Scouts in the Northeast Arkansas League. He played for lower level teams from 16 to 22, including the Cairo Egyptians and the Cleburne Railroaders. In 1917, he joined the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association, then one of the top minor leagues, for whom he pitched 448 innings in two seasons.\n\nBuck Weaver and Clarence \"Pants\" Rowland recommended Kerr for the major leagues and the Chicago White Sox team. This happened during the \"work or fight order\" of World War I. At the time Dickey was about 5’7 and weighed 155 pounds. Kerr was living in Fairbanks – Morse, Wisconsin, and worked in a factory. Weaver was a mechanic at one of the other shops at the same factory.\n\nThe owner of the Chicago White Sox at the time was Charles Comiskey, and the manager was Kid Gleason. Kerr played for the White Sox from 1919 to 1921.\n\nEight of Kerr's teammates took bribes to throw the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. They would forever become known as the Chicago Black Sox. These teammates were permanently banned from Major League Baseball after throwing the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds were Chick Gandil, Happy Felsch, Eddie Cicotte, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Lefty Williams, Buck Weaver, Fred McMullin, and Swede Risberg. Kerr was not involved in the scandal and won both of the games he started.\n\nNevertheless, owner Comiskey refused to give Kerr what he believed to be a fair raise. Dickey held out for more pay before the 1922 season and refused to play. This resulted in a suspension from the White Sox. Kerr played exhibition games with other teams. This led to a suspension from the Major Leagues by Commissioner Kenesaw Landis. Kerr did not play Major League Baseball from 1922 to 1924.\n\nDickey returned to semiprofessional leagues. In 1925, Kerr made a short comeback to the major leagues, playing for the White Sox. Kerr had a 53–34 career record. From 1927 to 1938, Kerr played for minor league teams before retiring from his playing career. \n\nFrom 1927 to 1940, Kerr worked as a coach. He began with the Rice University (then Rice Institute) Owls. He coached in Washington and West Virginia before accepting a position in Florida. Kerr began managing the Daytona Beach Islanders in the year of 1940.\n\nHis coaching led him to Stan Musial. Kerr told Musial, then beset by arm problems, to stop pitching and become a batter. Kerr's mentoring may have helped Musial attain his later success. Musial smacked career 3000 hits. In 1958, right before Musial's batting accomplishment, Kerr was working for an electric company. Musial gave Kerr a house for his birthday. He purchased the home for somewhere around $10,000–$20,000, from his income of around $100,000. Kerr lived there until his death in 1963.\n\nWriter Jim Baker noted that of the thirteen principal members of the 1919 White Sox, only Kerr and Nemo Leibold neither were banned for life nor were selected for the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Kerr is not eligible for the Hall of Fame under the Hall's current rules, which require a player to have played in at least ten major league seasons (Kerr played in only four).\n\nAlthough Kerr was never inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, his accomplishments received recognition. He \"received the inaugural Tris Speaker Memorial Award from the Houston Chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America\", an award given to athletes, and baseball officials that have made some sort of exceptional contribution towards the game. He received Houston's key to the city during a night honoring him in 1961 at Busch Stadium. A statue was dedicated to him at the Astrodome after his death.\n\nKerr lost his fight with cancer and died May 4, 1963, and he is buried in Houston, Texas at the Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery. Kerr's friend Stan Musial attended the Second Annual Old Timers' Game in honor of Kerr. His statue since has changed locations a few times. The bronze statue of Kerr started at the Astrodome and was last on display at Constellation Field. Its last known keeper was the Finger Family, and their curator Tom Kennedy.\n\nIn the 1988 film \"Eight Men Out\", about the Black Sox scandal, Kerr was portrayed by actor Jace Alexander. The film inaccurately portrayed Kerr as a right-handed pitcher when in fact he was a lefty.\n\n"}

Located on the portage is the neighbouring community of Seton Portage, which contains the other main communities of the Seton Lake Band of the St'at'imc Nation plus a mix of residential and resort homes owned by non-natives (pop. 700).\n\nThese lakes figured prominently as part of the Douglas Road or \"Lakes Route\", a series of trails and portages from the head of river navigation from the Coast at Port Douglas on Harrison Lake. During the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, a horde of miners bound for the upper Fraser bars around Lillooet streamed through the valley in the matter of a few weeks. Estimates range from 15,000–30,000 in this migration, although official records of the time suggest there were no more than 5,000 miners active on the upper Fraser at its peak.\n\nDuring this migration, Shalalth was largely bypassed as the \"road\" at this point was the waters of Seton Lake offshore from the benches above the lake forming the community. The Lakes Route was near-completely abandoned by the later 1860s due to the construction of the new Cariboo Wagon Road from Yale to the newer Cariboo Goldfields farther north via the lower the Thompson River and the town Ashcroft, where that route branches off from that river via the Bonaparte River.\n\nBy the late 19th century, an Oblate mission had been established at Shalalth, which as a result became known as \"the Mission\", a term which gaves its name to creek coming down from the high mountain pass above, and to that pass and the ridge from there to Lillooet along the north side of Seton Lake.\n\nThe steep, switchbacking packtrain route over this pass, 3500' in elevation above the lake, was the easiest route into the upper Bridge River Valley on the north side of the pass, and when that country's immense gold potential began to be increasingly prospected and exploited, the Mission Mountain trail evolved into the Mission Mountain Road, suitable for the first rugged trucks to replacement the old muletrains, although equipment for the mines being was still barged in by lake to Shalalth and then hauled piece-by-piece over the mountain. Then, before engines and freight wagons were brought in (a road along the route of the trail was not built until 1912) equipment and heavy supplies bound for the mines were rafted up the still-flowing Bridge River from a few miles west of the north foot of the pass (in order to avoid rapids and strong currents). Nearly all infrastructure costs for the development of the Mission Mountain Road and the Bridge River Road were born by local citizens, as the government would not invest; the same is true of the \"New Road\" through the canyon from Terzaghi Dam to Moha.\n\nSurvey and construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway along the lakes, completed by 1915, promulgated Shalalth as the \"port\" for the Bridge River goldfields beyond the pass, and a variety of cartage services and hostelries sprung up at the base of the road, just around the point from The Mission and the core village-area of Shalalth.\n\nThe traffic of professionals visiting the mines included Geoffrey Downton, a hydroelectric engineer who was the first to notice the hydroelectric potential resulting from the 1600' difference in elevation between the Bridge River and Seton Lake, which are only narrowly separated by Mission Ridge.\n\nDevelopment of the electrical potential was in full swing by the mid-1920s, with a \"model village\" erected around the west side of the bay where Shalalth is located, and one of the tunnels piercing the mountainside above completed, but construction came to a halt with the onset of the Great Depression and the collapse of the finances backing the project, and work ground to a halt in 1929. The townsite remained largely empty during the 1930s, although steady traffic to the mines in the Bridge River Country over the mountain kept the hotels busy.\n\nWhen World War II came, the semi-abandoned village built for the hydro project at the rail stop of South Shalalth, which had gone dormant at the start of the Great Depression and colloquially known as Bridge River, was chosen for one of several relocation centres for Japanese-Canadians from the coast in the Lillooet area. One of the relocatees at Shalalth was Dr. Masajiro Miyazaki, a US-trained osteopathic physician who stayed on after the war and became one of Lillooet's two Companions of the Order of Canada.\n\nAfter the war, construction of the hydroelectric project resumed with a vengeance, and along with a new boom in traffic to the mines came a surge in equipment to finish the power project. For the next twenty or twenty-five years, Shalalth became the main transportation hub for the surrounding region, with nearly 24-hour heavy traffic over the pass, either to and from the mines or to the new, expanded damsite just over the pass at the head of the Bridge River Canyon. In addition to lakeside hostelries such as Seton House and Shalalth Lodge at Shalalth itself, a large hotel was built above the hydro townsite's railway station, adjacent to the managers' houses and the semicircle of barracks built for workmen (which had been used for the Japanese relocation, as had the empty houses in the townsite itself). The hotel's guests included not only project-related visitors but businessmen and investors en route over Mission Mountain to visit the Bridge River mines. The hotel sadly burned down around 1949.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the population of the Bridge River Townsite on Seton Lake and Seton Portage area mushroomed into the thousands, mostly single men as is typical of construction booms but with enough families to boost the schools population into the hundreds. Other hydro townsites were located at Terzaghi Dam in the Bridge River Canyon, at Lajoie, below the site of Lajoie Dam 35 miles upriver, and also caused a building boom in Lillooet, filling in the formerly empty land between the old Main Street and the train station.\n\nA medical crisis in Bralorne, the most important of the Bridge River gold towns, at the far upper end of that valley, prompted community efforts to build a road via the Bridge River Canyon directly to Lillooet, which after the hydro project was finished had the effect of reducing the importance of the Mission Mountain Road and therefore also of Shalalth, once the hydro project was completed in 1962.\n\nIn recent history, the Seton Lake Indian Band built a new residential subdivision named Ohin, further east than the traditional Shalalth rancherie area (beginning at the base of the Mission Mountain Road to a few coves east). The name Ohin, pronounced \"OO(kh)win\" means \"frostbite\", is a reminder of the bitter cold of the Seton valley in winter. Beyond Ohin the roads peter out towards Lillooet, and travel to the foot of the lake is possible only by rail or water (although fragments of the old cliffside catwalks of the Lillooet Cattle Trail remain in places). There is a private recreational property before the first point, and two isolated reserves on debris fans farther along the lake, all of which are only accessible by water or rail.\n\nThe distance from the end of roads in Shalalth and Ohin to roads out of Lillooet is only about 10 miles along the lake, but the cliffside of the lake is too severe to allow any road construction because of the railway – which is already built on trestles. Locals sometimes walk the line, to the disapproval of the railway company. Sections of the old Lillooet Trail catwalks still exist on the cliffs above the rail line but are not safe to use. Mountain goats and sheep remain common on the slopes of Mission Ridge above Shalalth, and particularly along the bluffs around Retaskit and at Seton Beach, at the Lillooet end of the lake.\nBecause of the obstacle posed by the lakeshore, the Mission Mountain Road remains the valley's only official road contact with the outside world, although the High Line Road to D'Arcy/N'quatqua is serviceable for most vehicles (but not recognized as an official roadway for insurance purposes). Water taxi service is available on Seton Lake, but has no formal schedule or licensed service. Most pleasure craft on the lake are from the Lillooet end.\n\nIn the years since, the valley has dwindled into quietude, with the native people once again the majority of the population in the valley, and especially at Shalalth itself. Their local economy is based on a small native-run timber milling outfit and various small businesses, and there is a native-run school dedicated to the preservation and encouragement of St'at'imc culture and the St'at'imcets language.\n\nRegular passenger service to and from neighbouring native communities to the southwest and North Vancouver beyond ended in 2002, but service between Seton Portage and Lillooet (the region's main social and commercial centre) is available through the Kaoham Shuttle. The Rocky Mountaineer, a blue-plate tourism service, also operates along the rail line, but fares are prohibitive and the service only stops locally in Lillooet. Shalalth remains without easy road access to the outside world, the only two routes in and out of the valley being extremely difficult mountain roads – the Mission Mountain Road, and a powerline road along Anderson Lake known as the High-Line Road, leading to the native and recreational community of D'Arcy (N'quatqua) at the farther end of that lake, which connects by regular road to Highway 99 at Mount Currie, and from there to Pemberton, Whistler, Squamish and Vancouver.\n\n\n\n"}

The school is the only high school in the Kokomo School Corporation.\n\nThe earliest Kokomo High School found in records was in existence from about 1872 to 1916. The construction of the original Kokomo High School started in 1870 on the corner of Armstrong and Taylor with the first class commencing in 1872 according to a newspaper of that time. In 1898 the original high school burned down and a second building was built on the corner of Market and Sycamore. In 1914 the high school was again destroyed by fire. The third campus of Kokomo High School, first known as Howard County's Central School Building, was dedicated on October 19, 1917. Located at 303 East Superior Street, this building now houses Central Middle School.\n\nThe current campus of Kokomo High School was built in 1968 Previously, the downtown campus was known as Kokomo High School and the south campus was named Haworth High School. However, in 1983 the Kokomo-Center Township Board of Trustees decided that two high schools were no longer necessary. Consequently, in 1984 Haworth High School was closed and the former Haworth students began attending Kokomo High School. After the reorganization, Kokomo High School was split into two campuses. The downtown campus had 8th and 9th grade students, and the south campus (the former Haworth High School) had 10th, 11th, and 12th graders. After the south campus was expanded, the south campus became the primary location and served 9th to 12th grade students. The downtown campus later became Central Middle School in 1998.\n\nKokomo High School still has visible reminders of the building's history, including a framed portrait of C.V. Haworth and a case featuring Haworth's mascot, the Haworth Huskies. The C.V. Haworth award is also given to Seniors who show \"exceptional ability in writing and speaking\". The C.V. Haworth Memorial Scholarship Fund is available to capable seniors from Kokomo High School who are entering a bachelor's degree program at Indiana University at either the Kokomo or Bloomington campuses.\n\nKokomo High School is host to a variety of visual and performing arts programs. Within the school are ceramic, drawing, painting and multimedia studios. Students' works are displayed in the Student Gallery. Seniors submit art for the annual senior art show in May.\nPerforming arts are enjoyed in diverse student activities. Kokomo High School hosts six choirs: Chorale, Karisma, Choraliers, Vocal Jazz, Chamber, and Advanced Chamber. Fall Marching Band serves as the school's most popular extracurricular activity, placing second at Indiana's State Fair Band Day in 2017. Fall Color Guard and Winter Guard are similarly popular. Extracurricular music activities include Jazz Band, Winter Wind Ensemble, and Indoor Percussion. Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Concert Band, Wind Ensemble, Percussion, and Elementary and Advanced Orchestra comprise the school's music classes.\n\nKokomo High School offers more than 20 sports under the Indiana High School Athletic Association. It is a member of the North Central Conference. Boys' teams compete under the title of \"Wildkats;\" girls' team compete as \"Lady Kats.\" Fall sports offered by the school include Boys' and Girl's Cross Country, Boys' and Girls' Soccer, Boys' Tennis, Girls' Golf, Boys Football, Girls' Volleyball. Winter sports include Boys' and Girls' Basketball, Boys' and Girls' Swimming and Diving, and Boys' Wrestling Spring sports at Kokomo High School include Boys' Golf, Girls' Tennis, Boys' Baseball, Girls' Softball, Boys' and Girls' Track and Field, and Unified Track and Field.\n\nCheerleading and Competitive Dance are available as a non-IHSAA club sport.\nIn 2017, Kokomo High School's football team was the state runner-up in the IHSAA's Class 5A football. The competitive dance team also advanced to state finals for the 2017-2018 school year.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074481", "title": "Rosalind E. Krauss", "text": "Rosalind E. Krauss\n\nRosalind Epstein Krauss (born November 30, 1941) is an American art critic, art theorist and a professor at Columbia University in New York City. Krauss is known for her scholarship in 20th-century painting, sculpture and photography. As a critic and theorist she has published steadily since 1965 in \"Artforum,\" \"Art International\" and \"Art in America\". She was associate editor of \"Artforum\" from 1971 to 1974 and has been editor of \"October\", a journal of contemporary arts criticism and theory that she co-founded in 1976.\n\nKrauss was born to Matthew M. Epstein and Bertha Luber in Washington D.C. and grew up in the area, visiting art museums with her father. After graduating from Wellesley in 1962, she attended Harvard, whose Department of Fine Arts (now Department of History of Art and Architecture) had a strong tradition of the intensive analysis of actual art objects under the aegis of the Fogg Museum.\n\nKrauss wrote her dissertation on the work of David Smith. Krauss received her Ph.D. in 1969. The dissertation was published as \"Terminal Iron Works\" in 1971.\n\nIn the late-1960s and early-1970s Krauss began to contribute articles to art journals such as \"Art International\" and \"Artforum\" — which, under the editorship of Philip Leider, was relocated from California to New York. She began by writing the \"Boston Letter\" for \"Art International,\" but soon published well-received articles on Jasper Johns (\"Lugano Review\", 1965) and Donald Judd (\"Allusion and Illusion in Donald Judd,\" \"Artforum\", May 1966). Her commitment to the emerging minimal art in particular set her apart from Michael Fried, who was oriented toward the continuation of modernist abstraction in Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland and Anthony Caro. Krauss's article \"A View of Modernism\" (\"Artforum\", September 1972), was one signal of this break.\n\nKrauss became dissatisfied with \"Artforum\" when in its November 1974 issue it published a full-page advertisement by featuring the artist Lynda Benglis aggressively posed with a large latex dildo and wearing only a pair of sunglasses promoting an upcoming exhibition of hers at the Paula Cooper Gallery. Although Benglis' image is now popularly cited as an important example of gender performativity in contemporary art, it provoked mixed responses when it first appeared. Krauss and other Artforum personnel attacked Benglis' work in the following month's issue of \"Artforum\", describing the advertisement as exploitative and brutalizing, and soon left the magazine to co-found \"October\" in 1976.\n\n\"October\" was formed as a politically-charged journal that introduced American readers to the ideas of French post-structuralism, made popular by Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes. Krauss used \"October\" as a way of publishing essays on post-structuralist art theory, Deconstructionist theory, psychoanalysis, postmodernism and feminism.\n\nThe founders included Krauss, Annette Michelson and the artist Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe. Krauss was appointed as its founding editor. Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe withdrew after only a few issues, and by the spring of 1977, Douglas Crimp joined the editorial team. In 1990, after Crimp left the journal, Krauss and Michelson were joined by Yve-Alain Bois, Hal Foster, Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, Denis Hollier, and John Rajchman.\n\nKrauss taught at Wellesley, MIT and Princeton before joining the faculty at Hunter College in 1974. She was promoted to professor in 1977 at Hunter and was also appointed professor at the Graduate Center of CUNY. She held the title of Distinguished Professor at Hunter until she left to join the Columbia University faculty in 1992. In 1985, a monograph of essays by Krauss, titled \"The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths\" was published by The MIT Press.\n\nPreviously Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory at Columbia, in 2005 Rosalind Krauss was promoted to the highest faculty rank of University Professor. She has received fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts and has been a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts and of the Institute for Advanced Study. She received the Frank Jewett Mather Award for criticism from the College Art Association in 1973. She has been a fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities since 1992 and was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994. She recently received an honorary doctorate from the University of London.\n\nKrauss has been curator of many art exhibitions at leading museums, among them exhibitions on Joan Miró at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1970–73), on surrealism and photography at the Corcoran Museum of Art (1982–85), on Richard Serra at the Museum of Modern Art (1985–86), and on Robert Morris at the Guggenheim (1992–94). She prepared an exhibition for the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris called \"Formlessness: Modernism Against the Grain\" in 1996.\n\nKrauss's attempts to understand the phenomenon of modernist art, in its historical, theoretical, and formal dimensions, have led her in various directions. She has, for example, been interested in the development of photography, whose history – running parallel to that of modernist painting and sculpture – makes visible certain previously overlooked phenomena in the \"high arts\", such as the role of the indexical mark, or the function of the archive. She has also investigated certain concepts, such as \"formlessness\", \"the optical unconscious\", or \"pastiche\", which organize modernist practice in relation to different explanatory grids from those of progressive modernism, or the avant-garde.\n\nLike many, Krauss had been drawn to the criticism of Clement Greenberg, as a counterweight to the highly subjective, poetic approach of Harold Rosenberg. The poet-critic model proved long-lasting in the New York scene, with products from Frank O'Hara to Kynaston McShine to Peter Schjeldahl, but for Krauss and others, its basis in subjective expression was fatally unable to account for how a particular artwork's objective structure gives rise to its associated subjective effects.\n\nGreenberg's way of assessing how an art object works, or how it is put together, became for Krauss a fruitful resource; even if she and fellow \"Greenberger\", Michael Fried, would break first with the older critic, and then with each other, at particular moments of judgment, the commitment to formal analysis as the necessary if not sufficient ground of serious criticism would still remain for both of them. Decades after her first engagement with Greenberg, Krauss still used his ideas about an artwork's 'medium' as a jumping-off point for her strongest effort to come to terms with post-1980 art in the person of William Kentridge. Krauss would formulate this formalist commitment in strong terms, against attempts to account for powerful artworks in terms of residual ideas about an artist's individual genius, for instance in the essays \"The Originality of the Avant-Garde: A Postmodernist Repetition\" and \"Photography's Discursive Spaces.\" For Krauss, and for the school of critics who developed under her influence, the Greenbergian legacy offers at its best a way of accounting for works of art using public and hence verifiable criteria.\n\nWhether about (Cubist collage, Surrealist photography, early Giacometti sculpture, Rodin, Brâncuși, Pollock) or about art contemporaneous to her own writing (Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt, Richard Serra, Cindy Sherman), Krauss translates the ephemeralities of visual and bodily experience into precise, vivid English, which has solidified her prestige as a critic. Her usual practice is to make this experience intelligible by using categories translated from the work of a thinker outside the study of art, such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Ferdinand de Saussure, Jacques Lacan, Jean-François Lyotard, Jacques Derrida, Georges Bataille, or Roland Barthes. Indeed, she participated in the translation of Lacan's key text \"Television\" which was published in October and later reissued in book form by Norton. Her work has helped establish the position of these writers within the study of art, even at the cost of provoking anxiety about threats to the discipline's autonomy. She is currently preparing a second volume of collected essays as a sequel to \"The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths\" (1986).\n\nIn many cases, Krauss is credited as a leader in bringing these concepts to bear on the study of modern art. For instance, her \"Passages in Modern Sculpture\" (1977) makes important use of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology (as she had come to understand it in thinking about minimal art) for viewing modern sculpture in general. In her study of Surrealist photography, she rejected William Rubin's efforts at formal categorization as insufficient, instead advocating the psychoanalytic categories of \"dream\" and \"automatism\", as well as Jacques Derrida's \"grammatological\" idea of \"spacing.\" See \"The Photographic Conditions of Surrealism\" (\"October\", winter 1981).\n\nConcerning Cubist art, she took Picasso's collage breakthrough to be explicable in terms of Saussure's ideas about the differential relations and non-referentiality of language, rejecting efforts by other scholars to tie the pasted newspaper clippings to social history. Similarly, she held Picasso's stylistic developments in Cubist portraiture to be products of theoretical problems internal to art, rather than outcomes of the artist's love life. Later, she explained Picasso's participation in the \"rappel à l'ordre\" or return to order of the 1920s in similar structuralist terms. See \"In the Name of Picasso\" (\"October\", spring 1981), \"The Motivation of the Sign\" (in Lynn Zelevansky, ed., \"Picasso and Braque: A Symposium\", 1992), and \"The Picasso Papers\" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998).\n\nFrom the 1980s, she became increasingly concerned with using a psychoanalytic understanding of drives and the unconscious, owing less to the Freudianism of an André Breton or a Salvador Dalí, and much more to the structuralist Lacan and the \"dissident surrealist\" Bataille. See \"No More Play\", her 1984 essay on Giacometti, as well as \"Corpus Delicti\", written for the 1985 exhibition \"L'Amour Fou: Photography and Surrealism\", \"Cindy Sherman: 1975–1993\" and \"The Optical Unconscious\" (both 1993) and \"Formless: A User's Guide\" with Yve-Alain Bois, catalog to the exhibition \"L'Informe: Mode d'emploi\" (Paris: Centre Pompidou, 1996).\n\nYears after her time at \"Artforum\" in the 1960s, Krauss also returned to the drip painting of Jackson Pollock as both a culmination of modernist work within the format of the \"easel picture\", and a breakthrough that opened the way for several important developments in later art, from Allan Kaprow's happenings to Richard Serra's lead-flinging process art to Andy Warhol's oxidation (i.e. urination) paintings. For reference, see the Pollock chapter in \"The Optical Unconscious,\" several entries in the \"Formless\" catalog, and \"Beyond the Easel Picture\", her contribution to the MoMA symposium accompanying the 1998 Pollock retrospective (\"Jackson Pollock: New Approaches\"). This direction provided intellectual validation for the explosive Pollock markets; but it exacerbated already tense relations between herself and more radical currents in visual/cultural studies, the latter growing steadily impatient with the traditional western art-historical canon.\n\nIn addition to writing focused studies about individual artists, Krauss also produced broader, synthetic studies that helped gather together and define the limits of particular fields of practice. Examples of this include \"Sense and Sensibility: Reflections on Post '60s Sculpture\" (\"Artforum\", Nov. 1973), \"Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism\" (\"October\", spring 1976), \"Notes on the Index: Seventies Art in America\", in two parts, \"October\" spring and fall 1977), \"Grids, You Say\", In \"Grids: Format and Image in 20th Century Art\" (exh. cat.: Pace Gallery, 1978), and \"Sculpture in the Expanded Field\" (\"October\", spring 1979). Some of these essays are collected in her book \"The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The band wrote all its songs about movies and was named after a 1971 film directed by Monte Hellman. The members of the band were Matt Harrop on vocals and guitar, Luke Hutching on bass, Phil Smiley on drums, and Pip Brown on lead guitar and background vocals.\n\nThe band was influenced by protopunk groups such as The Stooges and The MC5, and were often compared with contemporary hard rock bands such as fellow countrymen The Datsuns.\n\nThe band formed in early 2001 when Harrop's then hardcore band was looking for a second guitarist. Harrop invited Brown to audition after meeting her in a documentary film class. Harrop and Brown's mutual interest in old cinema and 70s rock inspired them to form a new band and start writing songs. Smiley, a mutual acquaintance of Brown and Harrop, was asked to drum, introducing a darker feel to the sound, and another design school student, Ben Fraser, a trained jazz musician, was called in to play bass. As a member of two other local bands, Fraser didn't have enough time for the increasing workload of Two Lane Blacktop and soon left the band. Nato Hickey, bass player in the band Paselode, temporarily filled in while the band looked for a replacement. Hickey introduced the band to their future manager Dave Benge, then manager of New Zealand bands Fur Patrol and Cassette, before Hutching, lead guitarist for the band Fore Arm of Fury, was brought in on bass about one month before their first scheduled shows in Australia.\n\nThe band enjoyed quick success in Australia, riding the wave of the popular New Rock revival, and it wasn't long before the band was making frequent trips between the two countries.\n\nIn May 2003, the 7\" single \"The Rat\" / \"Hellhound\" was released through Infidelity Records and distributed throughout New Zealand and Australia. It gained considerable air play in each country and was placed on rotation by John Peel on his Radio 1 programme. The band was received well by the Australian press, appearing in the 'ones to watch' issue of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in June 2003, as did their single \"The Rat\", which made it onto the CD which came with that issue. Back in New Zealand, the band gained nominations for 'Best new band' and 'Best unreleased song' in the New Zealand BNet awards.\n\nIn mid-2003, the band made its first trip to America, playing 3 weeks of shows in Los Angeles and New York. On the band's return the first tracks of their new album were recorded at the language of love studios in Wellington – these recordings have never been released.\n\nIn late 2003, one week before an East Coast Australian tour with American band Modey Lemon, Two Lane Blacktop decided to split up.

As a part of his political activities he was the Chairman of National Council of American-Soviet Friendship starting from the early 1940s.\n\nLamont was born in Englewood, New Jersey on March 28, 1902. He was the son of Florence Haskell (Corliss) and Thomas W. Lamont, a partner and later chairman at J.P. Morgan & Co. Lamont graduated as valedictorian of Phillips Exeter Academy in 1920, and \"magna cum laude\" from Harvard University in 1924. The principles that animated his life were first evidenced at Harvard, where he attacked university clubs as snobbery. In 1924, he did graduate work at New College University of Oxford, where he roomed with Julian Huxley. The next year Lamont began graduate studies at Columbia University, where he studied under John Dewey. In 1928, he became a philosophy instructor there. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1932 from Columbia. Lamont taught at Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, and the New School for Social Research.\n\nLamont became a radical in the 1930s, moved by the Great Depression. He wrote a book about the Soviet Union and praised what he saw there: \"The people are better dressed, food is good and plentiful, everyone seems confident, happy and full of spirit\". He became critical of the Soviets over time, but always thought their achievement in transforming a feudal society remarkable, even as he attacked its treatment of political dissent and lack of civil liberties. Lamont's political views were Marxist and socialist for much of his life.\n\nLamont was one-time chairman of the Friends of the Soviet Union.\n\nLamont began his 30 years as a director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 1932. In 1934, he was arrested while on a picket line in Jersey City, New Jersey, part of a long battle between labor and civil rights activists and Frank Hague, the city's mayor. Lamont later wrote that he \"learned more about the American legal system in one day .. than in one year at Harvard Law School\".\n\nIn 1936, Lamont helped found and subsidized the magazine \"Marxist Quarterly\". When the Dewey Commission reported in 1937 that the Moscow trials of Leon Trotsky and others were fraudulent, Lamont, along with other left-wing intellectuals, refused to accept the Commission's findings. Under the influence of the Popular Front, Lamont and 150 other left-wing writers endorsed Josef Stalin's actions as necessary for \"the preservation of progressive democracy\". Their letter warned that Dewey's work was itself politically motivated and charged Dewey with supporting reactionary views and \"Red-baiting\". Lamont wrote an introduction to an anti-Polish pamphlet \"Behind the Polish-Soviet Break\" by Alter Brody.\n\nLamont was a key founder of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) (originally National Council on Soviet Relations or NCSR). (Other founders included: Professor Ralph Barton Perry of Harvard University and Edwin Seymour Smith.) He served as its first chairman from 1943 to 1947.\n\nLamont remained sympathetic to the Soviet Union well after World War II and the establishment of satellite Communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe. He authored a pamphlet entitled \"The Myth of Soviet Aggression\" in which he wrote: \n\nLamont ran for the U.S. Senate from New York, in 1952 on the American Labor ticket. He received 104,702 votes and lost to Republican Irving M. Ives.\n\nWhen called to testify in front of Senator Joseph McCarthy's Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1953, he denied ever having been a Communist, but refused to discuss his beliefs or those of others, citing not the Fifth Amendment as so many others did but the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The committee cited Lamont for contempt of Congress by a vote of 71 to 3 in August 1954. Some senators questioned McCarthy's authority and wanted a federal court to rule on it. In November Lamont donated $50,000 to create a $1,000,000 Bill of Rights Fund to support civil rights advocates, citing anti-Communist legislation, travel restrictions, and blacklisting in the entertainment industry. That same month he challenged the subcommittee's authority in court.\n\nThe same year, he penned \"Why I Am Not a Communist\". Despite his allegiance to Marxism, he never joined the Communist Party USA, and supported the Korean War.\n\nIn April 1955, Lamont withdrew from his role as a philosophy lecturer at Columbia University pending the outcome of these legal proceedings, and the university said it was Lamont's decision, made \"without prior suggestion by any officer of the university\". Judge Edward Weinfeld of the U.S. District Court found the indictment against Lamont was faulty, but the government, rather than seek a new indictment, appealed that ruling. A unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals agreed in 1955 and in 1956 the government chose not to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nAs a director of the ACLU, Lamont had resisted attempts to purge the organization of Communists and, in 1954, he resigned his position because he felt the ACLU had not supported him in the face of McCarthy charges. The complete record of the legal proceedings in Lamont's case against the McCarthy subcommittee was published in 1957.\n\nIn 1951 and 1957, he was denied a passport by the State Department, which considered his application incomplete because he refused to answer a question about membership in the Communist Party. He sued the State Department in June 1957 seeking a hearing on its action. He obtained his passport in June 1958 following a Supreme Court decision in another case, \"Kent v. Dulles\", and left the U.S. for a world tour in March 1959.\n\nHe ran again for the U.S. Senate from New York in 1958 on the Independent-Socialist ticket. He received more than 49,000 votes out of more than 5,500,000 cast and lost to Republican Kenneth B. Keating.\n\nIn 1959, Lamont became an enthusiastic supporter of Fidel Castro and his revolutionary government in Cuba.\n\nIn 1964, Lamont sued the Postmaster General for reading and, at times, refusing to deliver his mail under the anti-propaganda mail law of 1962, passed over the objections of the Department of Justice and the Post Office, that allowed the Postmaster General to destroy \"communist political propaganda\" sent from outside the United States unless the addressee says he wants to receive such mail. The statute did not apply to sealed correspondence, but was aimed at published materials. He lost a 2 to 1 decision in U.S. District Court, after the Post Office delivered one such item of mail, and he appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the single delivery was a subterfuge designed to moot his lawsuit while continue to interrupt his mail service. On May 24, 1965, he won in the Supreme Court, which held unanimously in a decision in \"Lamont v. Postmaster General\" written by Justice William O. Douglas, that the law was unconstitutional.\n\nIt was the first time the Supreme Court invalidated a statute as a violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. Lamont' attorney was Leonard B. Boudin, who worked on many civil liberties cases. He won a similar lawsuit against the Central Intelligence Agency in federal court the same year.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, he became chairman of the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, a position that he held until his death 30 years later.\n\nIn 1971, after a congressman called him an \"identified member of the Communist Party, U.S.A.\", Lamont issued a statement that \"although it is no disgrace to belong to the Communist party, I have never even dreamed of joining it.\" That same year, he financed Dorothy Day's visit to the Soviet Union and several other countries in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 1979, Lamont founded Half-Moon Foundation, Inc. Half-Moon Foundation was a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and was incorporated in the state of New York. The Foundation was formed \"to promote enduring international peace, support for the United Nations, the conservation of our country's natural environment, and to safeguard and extend civil liberties as guaranteed under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\"\n\nLamont was president emeritus of the American Humanist Association and in 1977 was named Humanist of the Year.\n\nIn 1981, he received the Gandhi Peace Award.\n\nIn 1998, Lamont received a posthumous Distinguished Humanist Service Award from the International Humanist and Ethical Union and he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nIn 1928, Lamont married Margaret Hayes Irish. They divorced in the early 1960s. In 1962, he married Helen Boyden Lamb; she died of cancer in 1975. In 1986, Lamont married Beth Keehner; she survived his death. He died at home in Ossining, New York, on April 26, 1995.\n\nFollowing the deaths of his parents, Lamont became a philanthropist. He funded the collection and preservation of manuscripts of American philosophers, particularly George Santayana, as well as Rockwell Kent and John Masefield.\n\nHe became a substantial donor to both Harvard and Columbia, endowing the latter's \"Corliss Lamont Professor of Civil Liberties.\"\n\nHe was the great-uncle of Ned Lamont, a 2006 Democratic Party nominee for Connecticut to the United States Senate, and current Governor of Connecticut.\n\nLamont was a prolific author. He wrote, co-wrote, edited, or co-edited more than two dozen books and dozens of pamphlets, and wrote thousands of letters to newspapers, magazines, and journals on significant social issues during his lifelong campaign for peace and civil rights.\n\nIn 1935, he published \"The Illusion of Immortality\" (originally published in 1932 as \"Issues of Immortality: A Study in Implications\"), which was a revised version of his doctoral dissertation. According to James Leuba the book is considered to remain the standard work on the subject and shows conclusively that the arguments for immortality are totally insufficient. Lamont argued that people can live satisfactory lives without belief in life after death and that human life may be recognized to be more precious if it is realized that it only comes once to each man.\n\nHis most famous work is \"The Philosophy of Humanism\" (originally published in 1949 as \"Humanism as a Philosophy\"), now in its eighth edition. He also published intimate portraits of John Dewey, John Masefield, and George Santayana.\n\n\n\nAside from books, over the course of more than a half-century, Corliss Lamont authored, co-authored, or edited approximately three dozen pamphlets on a variety of subjects. Prominent among these was the \"Basic Pamphlets\" series, privately published by Dr. Lamont and sold directly by him through mail order via a local post office box in New York. There were 29 numbered titles in the \"Basic Pamphlets\" series, listed below by pamphlet number.\n\nIn addition to the \"Basic Pamphlets\" series, Corliss Lamont also wrote a number of other pamphlets, a partial list of which appears below.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074514", "title": "Battle of Fort Duquesne", "text": "Battle of Fort Duquesne\n\nThe Battle of Fort Duquesne was a British assault on the eponymous French fort (later the site of Pittsburgh) that was repulsed with heavy losses on 14 September 1758, during the French and Indian War.\n\nThe attack on Fort Duquesne was part of a large-scale British expedition with 6,000 troops led by General George Washington (British Army officer)|John Forbes]] to drive the French out of the contested Ohio Country (the upper Ohio River Valley) and clear the way for an invasion of Canada. Forbes ordered Major James Grant of the 77th Regiment to reconnoiter the area with 850 men. Grant, apparently on his own initiative, proceeded to attack the French position using traditional European military tactics. His force was out-maneuvered, surrounded, and largely destroyed by the French and their native allies led by François-Marie Le Marchand de Lignery. Major Grant was taken prisoner and the British survivors retreated fitfully to Fort Ligonier.\n\nAfter repulsing this advance party the French, deserted by some of their native allies and vastly outnumbered by the approaching Forbes, blew up their magazines and burnt Fort Duquesne. In November the French withdrew from the Ohio Valley and British colonists erected Fort Pitt on the site.\n\nForbes commanded between 5,000 and 7,000 men, including a contingent of Virginians led by George Washington. Forbes, very ill, did not keep up with the advance of his army, but entrusted it to his second in command, Lt. Col. Henry Bouquet, a Swiss officer commanding a battalion of the Royal American Regiment. Bouquet sanctioned a reconnaissance of Fort Duquesne by Major James Grant of Ballindalloch,\n\nOn September 11, 1758, Grant led over 800 men to scout the environs of Fort Duquesne ahead of Forbes' main column. Bouquet believed the fort to be held by 500 French and 300 Indians, a force too strong to be attacked by Grant's detachment. Grant, who arrived in the vicinity of the fort on September 13, believed there were only 200 enemy within, and sent a small party of 50 men forward to scout. These saw no enemy outside the fort; they burned a storehouse and returned to Grant's main position, two miles (3 km) from the fort.\n\nThe next morning, Grant divided his force into several parts. A company of the 77th, under a Capt. McDonald, approached the fort with drums beating and pipes playing as a decoy. A force of 400 men lay in wait to ambush the enemy when they went out to attack McDonald, and several hundred more under the Virginian Maj. Andrew Lewis were concealed near the force's baggage train in the hope of surprising an enemy attack there ...\n\nThe French and Indian force was in fact much larger than anticipated, and moved swiftly. They overwhelmed McDonald's decoy force and overran the party that had been meant to ambush them. Lewis's force left its ambush positions and went to the aid of the rest of the force but the French and Indians had by then gained a point of high ground above them and forced them to retire. The Indians used the forest to their advantage; \"concealed by a thick foliage, their heavy and destructive fire could not be returned with any effect\". In the one-sided battle in the woods, the British and American force suffered 342 casualties, of whom 232 were from the 77th Regiment, including Grant, who was taken prisoner. Out of the eight officers in Andrew Lewis's Virginian contingent, 5 were killed, 1 was wounded and Lewis himself was captured. Nevertheless, most of Grant's force escaped to rejoin the main army under Forbes and Bouquet. The Franco-Indian force suffered only 8 killed and 8 wounded.\n\nJames Smith wrote \"Notwithstanding their (the Indians') vigilance, Colonel Grant, with his Highlanders, stole a march upon them, and in the night took possession of a hill about eighty rod from Fort Du Quesne; this hill is on that account called Grant's Hill to this day. The French and Indians knew not that Grant and his men were there until they beat the drum and played upon the bagpipes, just at daylight. They then flew to arms, and the Indians ran up under cover of the banks of Allegheny and Monongahela, for some distance, and then sallied out from the banks of the rivers, and took possession of the hill above Grant; and as he was on the point of it in sight of the fort, they immediately surrounded him, and as he had his Highlanders in ranks, and in very close order, and the Indians scattered, and concealed behind trees, they defeated him with the loss only of a few warriors; most of the Highlanders were killed or taken prisoners.\"\n\nA plaque on the Allegheny County Courthouse, erected in 1901 commemorates the site of the battle, and the hill where the battle was fought is today called Grant Street, in Pittsburgh.\n\nThough the French had beaten off the initial British attack, Lignery understood that his force of about 600 could not hold Fort Duquesne against the main British force of more than ten times that number. The French continued to occupy Fort Duquesne until November 26, when the garrison set fire to the fort and left under the cover of darkness. As the British marched up to the smoldering remains, they were confronted with an appalling sight. The Indians had decapitated many of the dead Highlanders and impaled their heads on the sharp stakes on top of the fort walls, with their kilts displayed below. The British and Americans rebuilt Fort Duquesne, naming it Fort Pitt after the British prime minister William Pitt, who had ordered the capture of that strategic location.\n\n\n"}

Plant, was a system of railroads and steamboats in the U.S. South, taken over by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The original line of the system was the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway, running across southern Georgia. The Plant Investment Company was formed in 1882 to lease and buy other railroads and expand the system. Other major lines incorporated into the system include the Savannah and Charleston Railroad and the Brunswick and Western Railroad.\n\nThe Atlantic and Gulf Railroad went bankrupt on January 1, 1877, and Henry Plant bought it on November 4, 1879, reorganizing it as the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway on December 9. \n\nPlant bought the Savannah and Charleston Railroad (opened 1860) in 1880, reorganizing it as the Charleston and Savannah Railway. That acquisition extended the line from Savannah northeast to Charleston, South Carolina, where the Ashley River Railroad (operated by the C&S) connected to the Northeastern Railroad (later part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad main line).\n\nThe Waycross and Florida Railroad and East Florida Railway were chartered in February 1880, forming the Georgia and Florida parts of the \"Waycross Short Line\". That line, running from the main line at Waycross southeast to Jacksonville, Florida, opened in April 1881.\n\nIn 1882, the Chattahoochee Branch opened from Climax on the main line southwest to the Florida state line, where the Chattahoochee and East Pass Railroad (chartered 1881) continued to River Junction, Florida, a hamlet which later came to be known as Chattahoochee, Florida. At River Junction, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad's Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad continued west, and the Florida Central and Western Railroad ran east to Jacksonville.\n\nThe Live Oak and Rowland's Bluff Railroad and Live Oak, Tampa and Charlotte Harbor Railroad were chartered in 1881 to continue the short Florida Branch south from Live Oak further into Florida (eventually reaching Gainesville with a branch to Lake City). Plant tried to acquire the narrow gauge Florida Southern Railway to continue this line, but was unsuccessful, and on May 4, 1883 he bought 3/5 of the stock of the narrow gauge South Florida Railroad. At the time, the only connection between this system, with a main line from Sanford west to Tampa, was via steamboats on the St. Johns River from Jacksonville to Sanford.\n\nThe Plant Investment Company was formed in 1882 to lease and buy other railroads and expand the system.\n\nThe various lines of the SF&W were consolidated into one company in 1884. Specifically, the following companies lost their corporate existence:\n\nThe Brunswick and Western Railroad, opened in the late 1850s as the Brunswick and Florida Railroad, was bought by Plant in 1884.\n\nIn 1886, the system was changed to ; it had previously consisted of broad gauge lines and narrow gauge lines.\nIn 1887 the Green Pond, Walterboro and Branchville Railway opened as a short branch of the main line to Walterboro, South Carolina. The Walterborough and Western Railroad continued that line to Ehrhardt in 1896, and the two were merged into the Green Pond, Walterboro and Branchville Railroad in 1900.\n\nOn May 30, 1887, Florida state law chapter 3794 was approved, authorizing the SF&W to build lines from Tallahassee and Monticello north to the Georgia state line, connecting to branches from Thomasville, Georgia. The Tallahassee Branch was never built, but the Monticello Branch opened in 1888.\n\nPlant obtained a controlling interest in the Alabama Midland Railway in July 1890. That line continued the main line from Bainbridge west to Montgomery, Alabama. The Southwestern Alabama Railway and Abbeville Southern Railway, two branches of that line, were acquired in the 1890s.\n\nIn 1890, the narrow gauge Florida Southern Railway went into receivership and remained so for two years. During this time, its Charlotte Harbor branch operated independently and converted this portion of the line to . In 1892, Plant bought the Florida Southern Railway under foreclosure and reorganized it as the Florida Southern Railroad. At this time, the Florida Southern system stretched from the south end of the Plant System at Gainesville south via Ocala, using trackage rights over the South Florida Railroad's Pemberton Ferry Branch, to Punta Gorda. The Florida Southern Railroad was integrated with the rest of the Plant System in 1896 and was converted to that same year.\n\nThe Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad was chartered in 1877 and opened in 1892, running from Ocala west to Dunnellon and then south to Homosassa and Inverness. A connection was built from Inverness to the South Florida Railroad at Pemberton Ferry.\n\nThe Winston and Bone Valley Railroad, opened in 1892 to serve phosphate mines near Lakeland, became part of the Plant System in 1896.\n\nThe Tampa and Thonotosassa Railroad was incorporated in 1893, running northeast from the South Florida Railroad in Tampa to the small town of Thonotosassa.\n\nIn 1895, Plant bought the narrow gauge Sanford and St. Petersburg Railroad (previously the Orange Belt Railway) in 1895, which stretched across the state from Sanford to St. Petersburg. The most profitable section of this line was immediately converted to , leaving the remaining section from Trilby to Sanford in its original gauge. The Florida Midland Railway in the Orlando area was acquired in 1896, its line north of the Sanford and St. Petersburg Railroad was abandoned, and its remaining track from Sanford to Kissimmee was converted to narrow gauge. By keeping these two connecting lines the same narrow gauge, they were able to work in conjunction with one another, utilizing the same narrow gauge equipment from both the Sanford and St. Petersburg Railroad and the recently converted Florida Southern Railroad.\n\nIn 1899, the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway, except for the branch to Titusville (which had been sold to the Florida East Coast Railway), was reorganized and bought by Plant as the Jacksonville and St. Johns River Railway. This supplied a connection between Jacksonville and Sanford without the need for a steamboat transfer at each end, as well as system connections at Tavares and Palatka.\n\nThe Plant System built the nearly straight Folkston Cutoff in southeast Georgia in 1901. This ran from the old Waycross and Florida Railroad at Folkston north via Nahunta to Jesup on the SF&W mainline, allowing trains to bypass Waycross and save over the old route.\n\nIn 1901, the Green Pond, Walterboro and Branchville Railroad, the Ashley River Railroad, the Abbeville Southern Railway; and Southern Alabama Railroad were all consolidated into the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway.\n\nIn 1901, the following companies were also merged into the SF&W:\n\nIn 1902 the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad acquired the entire Plant System, connecting at Charleston, SC. The components were soon merged into the ACL. The system has since become part of CSX after several mergers.\n\nAssociated with the railroad were the Plant Steamship Line and Canada Atlantic and Plant Steamship Co., Ltd., both with Henry B. Plant as chief officer. The Tampa, Florida based steamships served Cuba by way of Key West, Mobile, Alabama, and two local routes. The Canada Atlantic and Plant Steamship Co., Ltd., with no direct company terminal as at Tampa, served Boston and Canadian points at Halifax, Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island. Advertising touted \"Plant Steamship Line — Ships ply between the ports of 3 great nations: United States (Port Tampa, Key West, Mobile, Boston), England (Dominion of Canada), Spain (Cuba).\"\n\n\n\n"}

After twice batting over .350 for the Chicago Colts, he starred on championship teams with the Brooklyn Superbas and the New York Giants. At the end of his career he held the major league record for career games played (2,443); he ranked second in walks (1,064, behind Billy Hamilton's 1,187) and fifth in at bats (9,033), and was among the top ten in runs batted in (1,234), doubles (414) and extra base hits (661). He was also among the NL's top seven players in hits (2,461; some sources list totals up to 2,471), runs (1,589), triples (163) and total bases (3,447). After leading the league in assists four times and double plays three times, he set major league records for career games (2,132), putouts (4,850), assists (7,500), total chances (13,325) and double plays (881) as a shortstop; he still holds the record for total chances, and is second in putouts and fourth in assists. His 42-game hitting streak in was a record until , and remains the fourth longest in history and the longest by a right-handed NL hitter.\n\nDahlen was born in Nelliston, New York at the corner of Berthoud and Dahlen and East Main to a family of German descent. He was a very good hitter and had a good amount of power for the dead-ball era. He began his career with the Colts in , and during his eight years with the team finished among the NL's top ten players in home runs four times and in slugging average three times. He also scored over 100 runs with 10 or more triples in each of his first six seasons; in 1894 he posted the highest batting average to that time by a major league shortstop (various sources state .357 or .362), and he followed with a .352 average in . His 1894 season included a record 42-game hitting streak from June 20 to August 6, surpassing the 33-game streak by George Davis one year earlier. Amazingly, after going 0-for-6 in the next game, a 10-inning contest on August 7, Dahlen pulled off another 28-game streak, ending up having hit in 70 of 71 games. His mark was broken three years later by Willie Keeler, who hit in 44 straight; that NL record was eventually tied by Pete Rose. Only Joe DiMaggio, with his 56-game streak in , has bettered Dahlen's mark among right-handed batters. Dahlen also twice hit three triples in a game, and once he tripled twice in one inning (August 30, 1900).\n\nPrior to the 1899 season, Dahlen was traded by Chicago, and ended up in Brooklyn after another deal. His new team won the NL title in each of his first two seasons, and although his batting average had dropped from that of earlier years, he compensated by continuing to accumulate numerous walks and stolen bases and by playing outstanding defense. In 1902, he finished fourth in the NL with 74 RBI. In he set an NL record for fielding percentage with a .948 average, breaking George Wright's 1878 mark of .947; Tommy Corcoran broke his record in with a .952 average.\nAfter the 1903 season, Dahlen was traded to the Giants, the team he'd always strived to play for, in exchange for pitcher Jack Cronin and Charlie Babb. While Cronin and Babb contributed only three bad years to Brooklyn, Dahlen posted great numbers with the Giants, leading the league with 80 RBI in his first year, . In 1905 he was again among the RBI leaders, despite hitting only .242, as the Giants won their first World Series title. Although he was hitless in the five-game Series, he contributed with flawless defense and by drawing three walks and stealing three bases. He was often considered one of the quietest players in the game, keeping to himself most of the time. After the 1907 season, he was traded to the Boston Doves, for whom he played his last two full seasons. In he broke Jake Beckley's record of 2386 career games; his record was broken in turn by Honus Wagner in . He was named Brooklyn's manager for the 1910 season, but never finished above 6th place in four seasons. His last playing appearances were three games as a pinch-hitter in 1910, and one game at shortstop in .\n\nIn a 21-season career, Dahlen batted .272; his 84 home runs were then among the fifteen highest totals in history, and ranked behind only Herman Long (91) among shortstops. His 289 stolen bases after the statistic was redefined in 1898 were then among the ten highest totals, as were his 547 total steals since they were first recorded in 1887. His records for games and putouts at shortstop were broken by Rabbit Maranville, and his mark for assists was surpassed by Luis Aparicio, with his NL record standing until Ozzie Smith broke it in ; his record for double plays was broken by Roger Peckinpaugh. Dahlen's 14,566 total chances at all positions have been surpassed by only Maranville (16,091) and Wagner (15,536). In four years as a manager, all for Brooklyn, he posted a 251–355 record for a .414 winning percentage; he earned his nickname with a ferocious arguing style which drew 65 ejections as a manager, still among the top ten in history.\n\nDahlen died in Brooklyn after a long illness at age 80, and was buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, Brooklyn, New York City, New York. As of 2006, his grave remains unmarked.\n\nIn August 2008, he was named as one of ten former players who began their careers before 1943 to be considered by the Veterans Committee for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nThe Nineteenth Century Committee of the Society for American Baseball Research named Dahlen the Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend for 2012—a 19th-century player, manager, executive or other baseball personality not yet inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\n\nDahlen was featured in David Pietrusza's 1995 television documentary \"Local Heroes\" in the segment \"Knocking on Cooperstown's Door.\"\n\nDahlen was included on the Veterans Committee ballot for 2013 induction to the Hall of Fame. The results were announced on December 3, 2012. Dahlen received 10 out of 16 votes, falling 2 votes short of election, the highest total of any person on the ballot who was not elected and will have to wait until the end of 2015 for election.\n\n\n"}

It deals primarily with the Nanboku-chō, the period of war between the Northern Court of Ashikaga Takauji in Kyoto, and the Southern Court of Emperor Go-Daigo in Yoshino.\n\nThe latest English translation consists of 12 chapters of the 40-chapter epic, and spans the period from Go-Daigo's accession in 1318 (when Takauji was still a minor vassal of the Kamakura shogunate's Hōjō clan), through Takauji's betrayal of the Hōjō, and Go-Daigo's fall and expulsion by Takauji in 1333, to his return to Kyoto in 1338. Go-Daigo, unlike many of the emperors before him, sought to supersede the power of the \"shōguns\", and to actually rule in addition to reigning in name. Thus began a series of battles, both military and political, as the Fujiwara family, who dominated the Imperial regency following the fall of the Hōjō, sought to retain influence. These battles, political maneuvers, and other developments of the time are related in the \"Taiheiki\".\n\nThese battles are historically very important as they led to the extinction of the Southern Court of the Japanese Imperial Line, which to this day is seen as legitimate. Northern Court members may be considered pretenders, but the ramifications are relics of history. One Southern Court descendant, Kumazawa Hiromichi, proclaimed himself Japan's Emperor after World War II, calling Emperor Hirohito a fraud, as Hirohito's entire line is descended from the Northern Court. Despite this, he was not arrested for \"lèse majesté\", even when donning the Imperial Crest, because he had a koseki detailing his bloodline back to Go-Daigo in Yoshino. Kumazawa has been unsuccessful at creating any political change other than some sympathy.\n\nLike most Japanese historical epics, the \"Taiheiki\"s tendencies towards drama and exaggeration are acknowledged, but the text is regarded as remaining mostly accurate. It is the primary source on many of the warriors and battles of this period, and also documents elements of the fall of the powerful and historically important Hōjō clan.\n\nNHK's 1991 taiga drama \"Taiheiki\" was noted for its portrayal of Ashikaga Takauji as an agent of change against the decadent Hōjō, rather than a national traitor as generally viewed by Japanese historians.\n\n\n"}

He is known for his theory of the sublime in which he presents the notion of limit-situations in life as being central to the human experience.\n\nTsang was born in Wuhua County, Guangdong, China on 7 October 1943, the son of Tsang Kwok Ying (1906–1999), District Minister of (formerly Basle Mission) of Hong Kong, and Wong Kun Tsing (1916–2014), a devout Christian committed to the church and family. They moved to Hong Kong when he was two years old. Today he and his wife Tse Wai Yee live in Hong Kong. They have two sons, Tze Yee and Tze Yan.\n\nTsang attended church-operated public schools before studying at the University of Hong Kong from 1963 to 1968, graduating with a B.A. in philosophy and modern languages and an M.A. in philosophy. From 1968 to 1970 he was a philosophy tutor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. From 1969 to 1974, he continued his study at HKU for a PhD in philosophical method, which ended with his withdrawal due to gradual digression of his research interests. From 1975 until 2004, he was a faculty member in general education and religious studies at Hong Kong Baptist University; from 1978 to 1979, its exchange professor to Malone College, USA; and, from 1995 to 2000, head of its Department of Religion and Philosophy.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1991 Tsang re-enrolled for the PhD program at HKU, this time in philosophy of religion, with the research topic of existential wonder. To place the topic in a historical context, his supervisor F.C.T. Moore introduced him to Kant’s \"Critique of Judgment\" on the concept of the sublime. Eventually, he worked out a thesis on a new theory of the sublime in the tradition of Longinus, Burke and Kant, later published as \"The Sublime: Groundwork towards a Theory\" by the recommendation of Joseph A. Munitiz, then the Master of Campion Hall, Oxford.\n\nIn the light of Wittgenstein on \"language games\", Lévi-Strauss on \"ritual and myth\" and Freud on \"ideas and dreams\", Tsang develops a conceptual framework of [i] construal, [ii] evocation, [iii] affectivity and [iv] instantiation, giving a coherent account of the elements that can be distinguished in the phenomenon of the sublime, with the event of the Crucifixion as an exemplary instance. In the experience of the sublime, Longinus emphasises our contemplation and thought reaching the limit of the natural order of grandeur; Burke our self-preservation in situations which defy our existing capacities; and Kant our transcendence of the natural order as supersensible beings. Each of them is concerned with an aspect of the sublime which Tsang characterises, in general terms, as that which transports us to a self-realization at the limit of our existence.\n\nAccording to the theory Tsang proposes, the sublime is concerned with a limit-situation in life and our self-realization in it such that the core of all experience of the sublime is an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit. Life-limits are of three kinds, the top limit to our being which borders on that which transcends the natural and the human, the bottom limit to our being which borders on the non-existent, and the median limit which designates the bloom of our being in its domain. We come to an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit in our encounter with an object which is so construed that it elicits a set of thoughts and reactions pertaining to certain themes, including the limits of our powers and abilities, and the importance of being able to go up to or even beyond those limits.\n\nThe sublime is concerned with the notion of a limit to what can be said and thought and willed. The sublime is not an object \"per se\", but a particular manner in which certain objects are construed and are evocative of certain thoughts and reactions. There is no one common property of sublime objects, no one single emotional state in sublime experiences, which is an essential feature of the sublime. For the sublime is but a notion in the mind and heart of the person in relation to the object, any object, which is confronted as sublime. However, from the standpoint of an external observer, one is able to distinguish in the experience of the sublime that which presupposes the universality of certain concepts and human characteristics and that which belongs to particular cultural and social forms and varies from culture to culture.\n\n\"The Sublime: Groundwork towards a Theory\" is concerned with language, thought and ultimate reality; as such, the book is a sequel to Tsang's master's thesis on logic, language and religion, which concludes with the possibility of God's existence and the relevance of St Anselm's \"faith seeking understanding\" to the question of God's existence. \"Faith seeking understanding\" is the original title of Anselm's \"Proslogion\". The Epilogue of \"The Sublime\" alludes to, without affirming, two central ideas in the \"Proslogion\": that God is Existence (“I am that I am.” Exodus 3:14), as explained in Anselm's ontological argument; and that man is created in the image of God. Before engaging in the sublime, Tsang had been interested in existential wonder, which is wonder at the world of our existence and our existence in the world. An experience of the sublime, which is an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit, is existential wonder occasioned by an object construed as connected with going to the limit of some human possibility, and here the person may further respond in faith, seeking to understand what lies at the limit.\n\nThe Epilogue of \"The Sublime\" concludes with the self-fulfilling conception of the devout Christian in imitation of Christ the son of God under totally adverse conditions, attaining the sense of eternity in the active reflective order. Here is an example of the person of faith seeking to understand what lies at the limit of some human possibility, despite its inevitable subjectivity, even if unreachable, albeit ultimately desirable.\n\n\"The Sublime\" is recognised in some quarters as ‘an important work offering a viable theory for the concept of \"sublime\" in philosophy’. Among those who consider the theory to be acceptable are Alasdair MacIntyre, an influential moral philosopher, and Cyril Barrett, a renowned aesthetician and art critic. However, as has been pointed out, the theory as proposed, even if it is viable, needs to be spelled out further.\n\n"}

Virginia Tech also has had since 1974 a non-military marching band, The Marching Virginians.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1892, the Corps hired civilian bands to provide music when needed. One of the best-known of these groups was the Glade Cornet Band, formed by several Blacksburg townspeople in 1883.\n\nIn 1892, corps Commandant John Alexander Harman formed a six-piece drum and bugle corps. One member, Cadet Lieutenant Frank Daniel Wilson, sought out several other cadets with musical experience, and formed an unofficial band. Besides Wilson, the initial musicians included Sergeants Clifford West Anderson, John William Sample, Theodore Graham Lewton, and Lorenzo Montogery Hale; and Privates Harry Woodfin Phillips, William Marshall Watson, Charles Lewis Pedigo, William Rufus Prige, James Archer Walsh, and Robert Beverly, Jr. Professor and LtCol Ellison Adger Smyth was also a member of the band and a key figure in establishing the band, as well as the first football team in 1892. Wilson eventually convinced Harman and the board of trustees of the need for a distinct band company, and it was formed in May 1893 with Major James Patton Harvey as the first director and Wilson as the first company commander.\n\nIn 1894 the Corps traveled to Richmond for the first time for the unveiling of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. In 1896, the Band played at the Jefferson Davis Monument dedication in Richmond, Virginia. They were the only band so honored. In 1896, the band, along with the entire corps, traveled to Roanoke, Virginia for the first annual Thanksgiving Day VPI-VMI football game and pre-game parade to the stadium. This tradition continued until 1970, when Virginia Tech and VMI stopped playing in Roanoke. (The final Virginia Tech-VMI football game was played in Norfolk, VA in 1984.)\n\nIn 1898, the Band volunteered for duty in the Spanish–American War. The War Department authorized the organization of bands of twenty-four pieces for the volunteer infantry regiments. A Major Shanks wrote to Major Harvey, Director of the VPI Band, requesting him \"to prevail upon his Band to join the Second Virginia as its regimental band. The director, Major James Patton Harvey, and 20-members of the band joined some Blacksburg, Virginia townspeople and former bandsmen to form the Regimental band for the US Army's 2nd Virginia Regiment.\n\nSince service specifically as a VPI unit had been denied, along with the lettered units of the Corps, Major Harvey and fifteen cadets of the Band resigned from VPI and enlisted as individuals with the Second Regiment, along with four VPI alumni and five members of the Blacksburg Glade Cornet Band. Major Harvey was appointed Chief Musician and Leader of the new organization. The Second Virginia's new Regimental Band was a VPI organization constituted as an Army unit. The band was to be stationed in Cuba, however the war was over before they were scheduled to leave from Florida. They were called on to play many times during their stay.\n\nThe Highty Tighties were presented with the white citation cord in 1936 for meritorious service in the Spanish–American War. According to Band legend, the cord was pinned on the Band commander backward by Eleanor Roosevelt. It has been worn with the braid on the outside ever since. The official university story is that President Burrus presented the citation cord to the band.\n\nDuring the absence of Major Harvey, Frank Carper became director of the Band during his senior year in 1898.\n\nThe VPI Cadet Band and Corps of Cadets traveled to several expositions in the early 1900s. In 1901, the band played \"The Thunderer\" for John Philip Sousa at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Sousa was so impressed that he dedicated a performance of his latest march, \"Hands Across the Sea\", to the band. \nThe band played \"Dixie\" 72 consecutive times in 1902 at the Charleston Exposition, setting the world record. At this exposition, the band also played for Teddy Roosevelt, who was quoted to have said he \"had never seen such a band.\" John Philip Sousa met each member of the band personally in 1904 at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (100th anniversary celebration that was delayed for one year) in St. Louis, Missouri. The VPI Cadet Band played in their first of several Presidential Inaugural Parades for President Woodrow Wilson in 1917.\n\nWilfred Preston (\"Pete\") Maddux, a trombone and baritone player in the Highty-Tighties (member of the band from the Fall of 1917 to 1919), jointly composed \"Tech Triumph\" (1985 recording) in 1919 along with Mattie Walton Eppes (Boggs). Mattie Eppes was a neighbor of Pete in his hometown of Blackstone, Virginia. When he was home, Pete would often play violin with Mattie accompanying him on the piano. One evening in the summer of 1919, Pete asked her to help him compose a fight song for VPI. She played the tune and Pete wrote out the score and the words for two verses in a single evening. Pete Maddox is not listed in the yearbook with the band after 1919. Ms. Eppes later married John C. Boggs, Superintendent of Randolph-Macon Military Academy.\n\nThe Band gained a nickname while marching at the Richmond parade, honoring Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France in 1921. The drum major attempted a mace toss as he passed the reviewing stand. The wind blew the mace and it fell to ground, bouncing once. The drum major caught the mace off the bounce and still rendered a proper salute to the reviewing officer. Foch supposedly yelled 'hoity-toity' (\"show-off\" in French) in response to the drum major's display. For many years this was believed to be the origin of the band's name. However, history states that the name came from a cheer that was invented when the band was housed in Division E, the fifth stairwell of Lane Hall. While waiting for meals, each unit would give up a cheer. The bandsmen were tired of not having a name, and made up a cheer that went: \"Highty Tighty, Christ Almighty, who the hell are we? Riff ramm, goddamn, we're from Division E.\" It has since evolved over the years.\n\nThe Highty-Tighties formed several musical units within the band over the years, including \n\nIn addition to home coming parades and home and away football pre-game and halftime shows, the Highty-Tighties have marched and played at all manner of events within Virginia and elsewhere. The following are some of the significant activities and events in the life of the Highty-Tighties in the 20th century.\n\n\nin which VPI played against the University of Miami (1966) and Mississippi (1968). The games were televised as the \"game of the week.\" \n\n\nThe honor of marching in Presidential Inaugural parades has been bestowed on the Highty Tighties 11 times since 1917. This honor represents both the reputation and pride of the band and the hard work of Highty-Tighty alumni and friends in lobbying for this honor.\n\n\nTraditionally, the commander of the band has been a Captain, if the commander is a senior. If there are no seniors, the commander has been an enlisted officer. Over the years, the Drum Major was not always a senior, especially in early years of the band.\n\n\n"}

Macmillan Cancer Support's goal is to reach and improve the lives of everyone living with cancer in the UK.\n\nThe charity was founded in 1911 as the \"Society for the Prevention and Relief of Cancer\", by Douglas Macmillan following the death of his father from the disease. In 1924, the name was changed to the \"National Society for Cancer Relief\", which it retained until 1989 when it was changed to \"Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund\", later changed again to \"Macmillan Cancer Relief\". From 5 April 2006, Macmillan Cancer Relief became known as \"Macmillan Cancer Support\", as this more accurately describes its role in supporting people living with cancer. It has adopted the principles of being a \"source of support\" and a \"force for change\".\n\nDouglas Macmillan was a vegetarian. In 1909, he wrote an open letter to all Christians entitled \"Shall We Slay\" which encouraged orthodox Christians to consider vegetarianism.\n\nAs the \"National Society for Cancer Relief\", the organization provided funding to support the work of the \"Breast Care and Mastectomy Association of Great Britain\" which would later become Breast Cancer Care.\n\nMacmillan Cancer Support is one of the 50 largest UK charitable organizations ranked by annual expenditure.

Macmillan also hosts other large fundraisers, including Brave the Shave which raises over £4,000,000 each year, as well as Go Sober for October which has raised over £3 million.\n\nMacmillan faced criticism when it placed adverts in Facebook and on Google associating the viral fundraising activity, the Ice Bucket Challenge with itself. It had been suggested that the aim of the Macmillan marketing campaign was to divert web traffic and subsequently awareness and donations away from smaller charities with whom the challenge had been mostly associated, namely those relating to motor neuron disease and ALS. \n\nAmanda Neylon, the head of digital at Macmillan, said the charity got behind the Ice Bucket Challenge, which asks participants to pour a bucket of iced water on their heads, because it was criticised for being too slow on the uptake for the #nomakeupselfie social media campaign. On missing out on the #nomakeupselfie campaign, Neylon said: \"We were too slow – it was a big motivator to be much better the next time an opportunity came along.\" \n\nIn 2016, Macmillan scrapped the head of digital role responsible for the controversial fund raising method mentioned above.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2074581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074581", "title": "Combat Action Badge", "text": "Combat Action Badge\n\nThe Combat Action Badge (CAB) is a United States military award given to soldiers of the U.S. Army of any rank and who are not members of an infantry or special forces unit, for being \"present and actively engaging or being engaged by the enemy, and performing satisfactorily in accordance with prescribed rules of engagement\" at any point in time after 18 September 2001.\n\nOn 2 May 2005, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army (CSA) approved the creation of the CAB to provide special recognition to U.S. soldiers who personally engaged, or are engaged by, the enemy. The CAB is intended to serve as a companion to the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) and Combat Medical Badge (CMB) and was created to recognize the greatly expanded role of non-infantry soldiers in active, ground combat.\n\nU.S. Army infantrymen or special forces soldiers with the rank of colonel or below and who are a member of a brigade-sized or smaller infantry or special forces unit, receive the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) instead of the CAB.\n\nSince the Combat Infantryman Badge was introduced in 1943, followed by the Combat Medical Badge in 1945, other army branches argued in favor of their own badges, but a War Department review board just after the war ruled these out. Unofficial combat badges for non-infantry soldiers were in some instances worn in violation of uniform regulations or included in personal award displays wherein the rifle and blue field of the CIB were replaced with the appropriate army branch insignia and color. These unofficial combat badges began to appear shortly after the creation of the Combat Infantryman Badge and while the practice continued until the creation of an official non-infantry combat badge it never became widespread.\n\nThroughout the Vietnam War and afterward, soldiers serving in combat engineer and armored units continued to lobby for their own version of the EIB/CIB. Despite numerous staff studies and recommendations, the request never gained the support of senior army leadership. However, as soldiers from across the spectrum of military occupational specialties engaged in direct contact with enemy forces in the Global War on Terrorism, the proposal gained new traction.\n\nIt appears that the concept for the current Combat Action Badge came when Captain Shawn Monien reignited the debate on establishing combat/expert badges for all soldiers of the United States Army in his September–October 2003 \"Armor\" magazine article, \"Reinstating the Combat Tanker Badge\" drawing historical references to General George S. Patton in World War I and other historical vignettes from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. Monien's article encouraged former United States Army Chief of Armor, Major General Thomas H. Tait to re-join the effort:\n\nMajor Matthew De Pirro continued the narrative of a combat badge in 2004 with an article written for \"Armor\" magazine in Spring 2004 describing the need for such a badge based upon the evolving face of warfare and the ongoing transformation of the army. De Pirro stated:\n\nThe Combat Action Badge was originally planned as a ribbon which was to have been known as the \"Combat Recognition Ribbon\" (similar to the Navy/Marine Corps Combat Action Ribbon created in 1969). However, as ribbons are generally seen as less prestigious than medals and badges, the CAB was then proposed as the \"Close Combat Badge\" (or CCB), thus granting the award badge status vice ribbon. This was to be a combat award only for soldiers who did not hold the infantry military occupational specialty (MOS), but who were deployed specifically to fulfill an infantry duty. This was in response to the large number of non-infantry (Tank crews, Field Artillerymen example) who were deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and whose units were reorganized to function as infantry (motorized or light) due to the lack of need for tanks, Artillery and shortage of infantry. The change from the Close Combat Badge to the Combat Action Badge may have come about thanks to a question put to Donald Rumsfeld in an April 2005 Afghanistan town hall meeting by a female military policeman as to why the CCB would not include military police soldiers in its awarding criteria despite the combat nature of the military police's job in Afghanistan and Iraq's 360-degree battlefield.\n\nThe Combat Action Badge was approved on May 2, 2005, and was retroactively awarded to soldiers who were engaged in combat after September 18, 2001. On June 29, 2005, General Peter J. Schoomaker awarded the CAB for the first time to Sergeants April Pashley, Michael Buyas, Manuel J. Montano, Timothy Gustafson and Sean Steans. Over one hundred thousand CABs have been awarded since the creation of the award. Most commanders do not issue the CAB to qualified soldiers unless they are directly engaged in combat. Notably, it is granted exclusively for contact with enemy combatants, so actions by noncombatants like detainees or rioting civilians do not qualify. The soldier must be personally present and actively engaging or being engaged by the enemy, and performing satisfactorily in accordance with the prescribed rules of engagement. There is no specific requirement for the enemy hostile contact to be direct.\n\nThe Combat Action Badge may be awarded to any soldier not assigned or attached to a unit that would qualify the soldier for the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) or Combat Medical Badge (CMB) after the date of September 18, 2001, and:\nThe CAB may be awarded to any army branch or military occupational specialty including infantrymen except when serving in a role where they would be eligible for the CIB. In addition to Army soldiers, the CAB may also be awarded to Servicemembers of other U.S. Armed Forces and foreign military personnel assigned to a U.S. Army unit, provided they meet the above criteria (for example, KATUSA in the 2d Infantry Division).\n\nThe Combat Action badge is unique in that unlike the Combat Infantryman and Combat Medical badges, it can be awarded to soldiers of any rank, including general officers, whereas the CIB and CMB are both restricted to colonels and below.\n\nAward of the CAB is not automatic and will not be awarded solely based on award of the PH.\n\nThe only current qualifying period for the CAB is the Global War on Terrorism. Thus, only one CAB can be awarded to any soldier at this time. Retroactive awards of the CAB are not authorized prior to 18 September 2001. Award of the CAB is authorized for the following qualifying wars, conflicts, and operations. To date, a separate award of the CAB has been authorized for qualified Soldiers in the following qualifying period:\n\n\nAward for qualifying service in any previous conflict is not authorized. Subsequent award of the CAB is not authorized for the same qualifying period, as outlined above.\n\nThe emblem features both an M9 bayonet and M67 grenade. A silver badge 2 inches (5.08 cm) in width overall consisting of an oak wreath supporting a rectangle bearing a bayonet surmounting a grenade, all silver. In comparison to the CIB, the CAB has a silver rectangle backing rather than blue, and the CAB is 1 inch shorter in length than the CIB. Second and subsequent award of the CAB will be indicated by superimposing one and two stars respectively, centered at the top of the badge between the points of the oak wreath; one star for the second award and two stars for the third award. However, like the CIB and CMB, only one can be awarded per \"qualifying period;\" as defined in AR 600-8-22. When worn, the CAB is worn on the left side of a jacket or blouse.

Daba Myroad, traveling with his friend Mirao Kyao encounters a group of thieves led by Miyama Lilin, who seeks to sell the L-Gaim for a lot of money. The thieves' initial attack ends in failure and one of them, a teenage girl named Fanneria Amu defects after falling in love with Daba. When Daba makes a promise to one of the dying thieves to deliver a cash card to a man named Amandara Kamandara, the three of them head to the city of Prearmo, where the thieves continue to chase them. It is here where Daba meets Lillith Fuau, the last remaining fairy in the Pentagona world. Lilin is eventually killed by one of her own subordinates, and Gavlet Gablae, a man who seeks to join the Poseidal military becomes their new leader. While Daba and the others have a hard time finding Amandara Kamandara, Gavlet finds him himself and gets a recommendation to join the Poseidal military, where he's placed under Chai Char, one of the military's 'Elite 13'.\n\nWhen Amandara Kamandara leaves Koam and heads to the planet Mizum, Daba is dedicated to following him so he can return the cash card. Along with Amu, Kyao and Lilith, Daba steals a space shuttle and heads to space. Brought along by accident is Gaw Ha Leccee, a high ranking female officer of the Poseidal military. Their ship arrives on Mizum under pursuit by Gavlet and are saved due to the large rebel factions on that planet. When Leccee falls in love with Daba and defects from the military, Nei Mo Han is sent to Mizum to defeat the rebels by her lover, and head of the Elite 13, Giwaza Lowau. Teaming up with Gavlet and Chai, Nei attacks the rebels multiple times but is unable to defeat them. Meanwhile, Daba and the others have teamed up with the rebels on Mizum, led by Stella Coban. Heading through Mizum and finding the now wiped out civilization of the Yaman Clan, Daba finally meets Amandara Kamandara face to face and angrily returns the cash card after all the trouble its caused. Amandara, a wealthy trader who provides arms to the military gives the rebels a tremendous amount of funds and weapons. When the Ape, Poseidal's personal ship approaches Mizum, Daba heads out to encounter her only to find a hologram in her stead. The rebels, who have started to mass-produce the L-Gaim are attacked relentlessly by the military and even though Chai Char is killed, the rebels are massacred and Stella is killed. Daba, Kyao, Leccee and Lillith return to space while Amu decides to stay behind on Mizum.\n\nUpon reaching space, Daba and Kyao head to Theart Star, an independent asteroid base in Pentagona that's not controlled by Poseidal. Populated entirely by women, the asteroid base is led by the mysterious Full Flat. Gavlet meanwhile is given the planetary bomber Slender Skala by Giwaza and pursues our heroes, forcing them out of Theart Star and attacking them multiple times. Desperate, Daba launches an assault on Sveto, capital of Poseidal's empire on the planet Gastogal. Hopelessly outnumbered, Daba and the others are saved when Amu shows up with the Turner, a ship given to her by Amandara Kamandara. Heading to the planet Trydetol, they encounter Daba's half-sister, Quwasan Olibee, who has become a puppet controlled by Poseidal.\n\nOur heroes reach the planet Trydetol, where they continue to fend with the military and are forced to defend themselves against Lilin's vengeful daughter. The third OVA movie, \"Full Metal Soldier\", presumably takes place during this time. In this short film, a radical member of Posidal's army attempts to ambush Daba with his bizarre Heavy Metal, which is controlled with an electric keyboard. Although the Daba and the L-Gaim are nearly defeated, Daba manages to somehow defeat him. Gavlet is given countless number of Heavy Metals in his pursuit but when he is given the prototype Heavy Metal, Amon Duule Stack he performs very poorly. During a battle Kyao steals the Stack and its creator, Mesh Maker. Sympathizing with the rebellions' efforts, Mesh decides to help. Kyao and himself highly modify the Amon Duule Stack and correct its problems by studying the L-Gaim's inner workings, turning it into the powerful L-Gaim Mk-II; an upgrade from L-Gaim in every sense with transformation ability, a self learning bio computer (that fans of the Five Star Stories will recognize the sillouhette of.), and a powerful generator capable of firing its main weapon, the Buster Launcher with almost none of the energy drain the weapon usually has on Heavy Metals. Upon its initial launch, it easily defeats a number of Heavy Metals including Nei's Auge with but one single shot of its powerful main weapon. Although Daba's new A-Class Mk-II outclasses almost all current Heavy Metals, a major threat to even Auge, the rebellion's progress is still troubled. Upset with what seems to be hopeless efforts against the military, Leccee leaves our heroes. Meeting up with rebel leader Semuj Shato, Daba continues to build up the rebel's power as they plan an assault on Gastogal. Meanwhile, Poseidal decides to promote Olibee over Giwaza, upsetting him so much that he decides to gather the Elite 13 and rebel against her, taking over Pentagona for himself. The rebels return to the planet Mizum and meet back up with Leccee, who has taken command of the ship Whale. After numerous battles with the military there, Daba returns to space where he once more encounters Olibee, who is still in Poseidal's grasps.\n\nUpset over Full Flat providing assistance to the rebels, Giwaza sends Nei to Sveto to inform Poseidal. Meanwhile, he manages to take Daba captive and brings him to Full Flat, who has ambitions of her own and decides to team up with Giwaza for the time being. It is here where it is revealed that Poseidal and Full Flat have eternal youth, bestowed to them by Amandara Kamandara through the mysterious power bio-relation. Daba eventually escapes from Full Flat, who directs Theart Star towards Gastogal. Semuj is revealed as Full Flat's spy, but as a valuable and loyal ally, Daba decides to forgive him. Meanwhile, Leccee, who has just recently rejoined the rebels with additional reinforcements (not to mention a new powerful Heavy Metal for herself, the Novel D'ssart.), heads to Sveto and encounters Poseidal. There she finds Nei who has been Posidal's captive since being abandoned there by Giwaza earlier, and gives her to orders to assassinate Giwaza. Upset over him abandoning her, Nei tries to kill him but ends up finally losing her life.\n\nThe rebels decide to advance the Star Dust Plan, an attack which features launching hundreds of asteroids around Gastogal towards Sveto. Giwaza meanwhile continues to advance his forces towards the planet as well, and takes Olibee captive. Gavlet, who has fallen in love with her and Daba try repeatedly to save her to no avail. All the factions converge around Sveto and the attack begins. During the assault Full Flat encounters Poseidal and tells her to recall the truth, that she is nothing but a puppet for the real Poseidal, Amandara Kamandara. The battle continues to escalate and Flat is killed when the L-Gaim Mk-II falls on her. Afterwards, during the heat of Star Dust's initial outing, Daba and Gavlet board Giwaza's ship for one last attempt to rescue Olibee, and after a daring duel with Giwaza Olibee is finally rescued as the two make their escape.\n\nAs Sveto is being bombarded, Poseidal struggles with her broken memories, and works at a computer console in an attempt to regain her memories, when Amandara himself finally makes his appearance and confronts Poseidal, whose real name is Mian. Amandara, the real Poseidal, is ready to retake his position. Having finally rescued Olibee, Daba is sent a message by Amandara in order to lure him in to kill him, thus ending any opposition to his rule. Daba sees right through this; however, Olibee, who bonded with Mian, feels that she is in danger and Daba agrees to go save Mian and finally take his family's revenge while Amu in the L-Gaim and Leccee in her Novel D'ssart aid the rebellion's efforts around Sveto. Daba has quite a fight entering Sveto, but eventually he and Olibee make their way in. Meanwhile, Mian, angered by Amandara's manipulative and malevolent ways, turns the tables on him with her personal guard intervening. Although Amandara tells them that he, not Mian is the true Poseidal they choose to remain loyal to her regardless. Daba then breaks into the conflict armed, and attempts to rescue Mian. They almost flee when Amandara quickly takes Mian hostage as his own personal guard Amon turns the tables once more. Before Amandara can have his way however, an explosion breaks up the conflict and Amandara flees deeper into Sveto with Daba in pursuit. Mian tells her bodyguards to help her to the Lachesis, the control center which helps keep the eternal youth of Amandara and herself active. Although it will kill Mian as well, it is the only way to stop him.\n\nDaba is led to the heart of Sveto, where Amandara reveals his own Heavy Metal, the Original Auge (Or Aug). Powered by the population's energy through the bio-relation, the system keeping him eternally young, he is virtually invulnerable. Although the formidable L-Gaim Mk-II puts up quite a fight, Amandara's Auge grows more powerful with each second and Daba finds himself in a losing duel. When Mian deactivates the bio-relation, their eternal youth is no more and they immediately age to their deaths as Daba takes this opportunity to deal a crippling blow to the now vulnerable Auge and is further aided by the timely arrival of Gavlet in his Bat-Shu Heavy Metal. Giwaza's forces are annihilated by the rebels and the Slender Skala, and with the death of the true Poseidal announced the rebels are finally able to declare themselves victorious. Giwaza however, attempts one last escape in an armed shuttle and in desperation attacks Daba and Gavlet. Before he can escape however, Daba fires one last fateful shot of the Buster Launcher and incinerates Giwaza once and for all. After the battle, Daba decides to return to Koam to live the rest of his life. There, he will take care of Olibee, who was brain damaged due to Poseidal's control. Gavlet, Leccee, and Amu all bid farewell to them, although they are all heartbroken having to say goodbye to the two.\n\n\n\nThe show was part of a digital subscription package from Daisuki.\n\n"}

He also fronts the side projects World Destroyer and Kreft, and since 2003 also has a solo project of his own.\n\nRasmussen was born in Sandnes, Rogaland County, Norway. His first musical ventures were with the black metal band The Childmolesters, which he founded in 1990 alongside his future Carpathian Forest bandmate Johnny \"Nordavind\" Krøvel. The band was very short-lived, ending in the same year; from its ashes arose Enthrone, which changed its name to Carpathian Forest in 1992. During Carpathian Forest's first years of existence, Nattefrost used the pseudonym Lord Nosferatu; he would not be known as \"Nattefrost\" (Norwegian for \"Night frost\") until 1995, when the band released its first EP, \"Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods\".\n\nIn 2000 Nattefrost formed his first side project, World Destroyer, alongside Eivind Kulde and his Carpathian Forest bandmate Daniel Vrangsinn. The band released a demo album, \"Diabolical Quest\", in 2004; it is their only release so far. He would form the duo Kreft in 2011 alongside Patolog Falk, releasing in the same year the EP \"Lommemannen\".\n\nIn 2003 Nattefrost announced that he would begin a solo project, and in the following year he released his first album, \"Blood & Vomit\". His second album, \"Terrorist (Nekronaut, Part I)\", came out in the following year and counted with guest appearances by numerous musicians, such as Carl-Michael Eide, Sanrabb of Gehenna and Hoest of Taake. He also released a live EP in 2006, entitled \"Drunk and Pisseskev at Ringnes 2004\", which was recorded during his first show, in Ringnes, and a compilation of rarities, \"Hell Noise and Live Terrorism\", came out in 2008.\n\nNattefrost's latest release was the 2009 split album \"Engangsgrill\", with Darkthrone's Fenriz's doom metal side project Fenriz's Red Planet.\n\nIn 2016 he collaborated with Urgehal, providing vocals and lyrics for the song \"Endetid\", off their seventh album \"Aeons in Sodom\". He previously collaborated with Green Carnation (on \"Light of Day, Day of Darkness\"), Taake (on \"Hordalands doedskvad\") and Aura Noir (on \"The Merciless\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074596", "title": "List of RahXephon characters", "text": "List of RahXephon characters\n\nThis is a list of recurring characters and cast in the anime/manga/novel series \"RahXephon\". Characters without speaking parts or who only appear in one episode or chapter are not included. The characters are first described as they appear in the TV series, followed by their portrayals in the other story versions.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Ayato Kamina is a student and artist living with his mother in Tokyo. Most of his artwork shown in the series consists of drawings or paintings of a girl on a cliff looking towards the sea. He has birthmark-like symbols on his belly resembling runes, which are revealed to be a sign of his being a potential instrumentalist for the RahXephon.\n\nAfter being taken from Tokyo by Haruka and the RahXephon, Ayato moves in with Rikudo Shougo, Haruka's uncle on Nirai Kanai. At first, this arrangement does not sit well with Ayato, as Haruka and her younger sister Megumi live in Rikudo's annex, but they slowly adapt to each other's presences. As a stranger from Tokyo Jupiter, Ayato struggles to find his place and acceptance in the outside world. Although he pilots the RahXephon in defending Nirai Kanai, he questions his abilities and self-worth. He also struggles with trying to piece together and understand his relationship with Haruka, handling the feisty Megumi, and interacting with the other TERRA personnel, who regard him with a broad spectrum of reactions, from acceptance and friendship to cool scientific interest to distrust and even contempt.\n\nIt is revealed that Quon is genetic provider of both Ayato and Itsuki Kisaragi while she is sleeping. Conceived with the help of Ernst von Bähbem and raised by Maya as an instrumentalist — someone who can successfully use the RahXephon to re-tune the world. There are several other instrumentalist candidates, but at this point of the series most have passed their ideal age.\n\nAt the end of the series, Ayato succeeds in becoming one with the RahXephon, and re-tunes the world. In this new world, the great dimensional split never happened, and Tokyo Jupiter never existed. Ayato is now an adult and married to Haruka and have an infant daughter named Quon.\n\nIn the movie, Ayato is Maya's naturally conceived biological son. In this version, he has to remain in his position as a \"Watcher of time\" and can not return to the world.\n\nIn the manga, Ayato is not just the result of in vitro fertilization but also of in vitro growing; multiple tanks with Ayato clones growing inside them are shown.\n\nA 29-year-old officer within the TERRA organization, Haruka Shitou is partially responsible for aiding Ayato in leaving Tokyo Jupiter. Originally a Captain in the Intelligence Division, she is promoted to Major in the Tactical Division.\n\nHaruka is shown to have very strong feelings for Ayato and struggles at maintaining a relationship with him for many reasons. Her position within TERRA makes Ayato think that she is only using him because of his ability to pilot the RahXephon. Ayato's own personal struggles also create barriers for their relationship.\n\nIt is later revealed that the girl that Ayato is constantly drawing and painting is actually a young Haruka. They had fallen in love when they were younger. The earliest date when the show places them together is at August 10, 2011, at age 13. When the Tokyo Jupiter barrier was established (just after the end of 2012), Haruka was on a vacation in a different part of Japan. Ixtli uses Ayato's distorted memories of Haruka to create the form of Reika Mishima. Haruka aged much more than Ayato in the outside world due to Tokyo Jupiter's time dilation effect. She had a relationship with Itsuki Kisaragi, possibly due to his similarity to Ayato.\n\nThere is no real difference between Haruka's portrayal in the series and in the movie.\n\nIn the manga, Haruka is more ditzy but has a similar role in the story until the end, where she is revealed to be a reincarnation of Reika.\n\nReika Mishima first appears in the series as the subject of one of Ayato's paintings. She then appears, in person, during the attack on Tokyo in episode 1. She leads Ayato to the RahXephon, and is shown to have some sort of connection to it via her singing.\n\nThroughout the series, it is hinted that Reika is not a normal human being. She does not have a reflection unless she needs to, Ayato is able to call her at an unassigned phone number, and she appears to alter Ayato's classmates' memories to make them remember her. She later appears as an aide to Makoto Isshiki, apparently altering TERRA personnels' memories in the same fashion. It is revealed that Reika is actually Ixtli, the soul of the RahXephon, and that her appearance is a manifestation of Ayato's innermost desires. This enables him to connect with and fully use the RahXephon; in artistic terms, she is his muse. Her form is chosen to closely mimic that of a young Haruka Mishima (later Shitou) with whom Ayato had fallen in love. This is to ensure that the performer, or instrumentalist, is more cooperative to Ixtli and more trusting of her than would initially be the case. Ixtli appears to Quon as Reika at first but later takes the guise of Ayato as he has become very important to her.\n\nDespite disappearing often, Ixtli/Reika Mishima is quite caring of Ayato, and will go the extra mile to see that he fully matures into his role as 'Ollin' and punishes those who would ruin her goal of a successful 'tuning'.\n\nAlthough Ayato initially rejects Reika after he learns the truth about her and what she is, he later chooses to accept her and become one with the RahXephon, thus enabling him to re-tune the world.\n\nReika is the focus of an important and recurring visual leitmotif used throughout the series. She stands on a higher point, with her back facing Ayato, and slowly turns around to smile upon him. This image is also repeated in Ayato's paintings. The origin of the leitmotif is shown in the \"Dandelion Girl Coda\" at the end of the series.\n\nIn the movie, Reika is one of the Watchers of Time, a 'soul' of one of the two RahXephons. Further complicating matters, Ayato and Haruka's granddaughter is also named Reika and appears identical to Reika Mishima.\n\nIn the manga, Reika is a more comical character who has grown up as Ayato's adoptive sister and who is openly jealous of any woman who gets between them. It is revealed that Reika is a Mulian miko who was forced unprepared into a ritual involving the RahXephon. The ritual failed disastrously, due to Reika's spiritual emptiness and destrudo. She is trapped in a cycle of reincarnation, and is destined to die prematurely. Despite Ayato's best efforts, Reika dies in his arms after they promise each other to meet again in a later life. As Haruka and Itsuki prepare to get married, it is revealed that Haruka is actually Reika's reincarnation and that Itsuki is Ayato's. This is a partial reversal of the TV series, where Reika takes Haruka's image.\n\nQuon Kisaragi is a mysterious young girl who speaks the first words of the TV series and is shown meeting Ayato in episode 4. Her standard expression of surprise or agreement is \"Ra-ra\" (or \"La-la\") and most of her dialogue is cryptic and musically themed. She and Ayato do not connect romantically, but she displays a level of both physical and interpersonal comfort and intimacy with Ayato. She is also one of the few people who never treats Ayato as a curiosity or an annoyance, and she seems to have an understanding of his situation and what his eventual role is, calling him \"Ollin\" (\"motion\" in Nahua).\n\nLike Ayato, she has the marks of a potential instrumentalist. She and Ayato are both shown undergoing examinations, and while outside of her home she wears a vest-like device called a Life Module. Quon is skilled in playing both the violin and piano. She also is portrayed as curious about music that other people listen to on headphones, often taking them off to listen to the music.\n\nIt is later revealed that Quon is a Mulian. She is the sister of Maya Kamina, and the genetic provider of both Ayato Kamina and Itsuki Kisaragi. When she entered the human world, she slept for quite a while and stayed young, while Maya is awake and grew older. Because of this, she is often called the \"Sleeping Beauty\".\n\nIn episode 9, Quon goes with Ayato into a shrine (shaped like a Ryukyuan tomb) where she learns that she is also \"Ollin\". After a period of lying comatose she goes with Ayato to Tokyo Jupiter, where she finds her own black RahXephon. At the end of the series, she merges with this RahXephon, and appears to battle Ayato after he merges with his RahXephon. She is eventually absorbed into Ayato, and he re-tunes the world. In the new world, the infant child of Ayato and Haruka is named Quon and also has pink hair, suggesting that Quon is reborn into the re-tuned world.\n\nIn the designs created by Akihiro Yamada and adapted by Hiroki Kanno, Quon is shown wearing a short dress with long sleeves, the Life Module, high heeled shoes, a thigh strap (worn like a garter), a beret, and a parasol, leading to a stereotypical \"French\" look. In some illustrations, like Yamada's DVD 2 cover design (used in France and Japan, but not in the initial U.S. and UK release), Quon wears a frilly lace-trimmed dress and stockings, which with the parasol complete a \"Gothic Lolita\" look. In \"Ouran High School Host Club\", another anime series by Bones, the \"French\" otaku Renge is shown cosplaying as Quon on one occasion.\n\nIn the movie, Quon is a failed instrumentalist who is forced against her will to destroy the world of the humans. She spends most of the movie asleep, awakening only for her final conflict with Ayato.\n\nIn the manga, as in the TV series, Quon and Maya show friendship and love towards each other, but here Quon goes into battle against the malevolent Maya.\n\nThe RahXephon is a bipedal humanoid mecha. It is about 50 m high, immensely strong, and capable of unassisted flight. Its offensive capabilities include energy blades which project from its forearms, concussion energy bullets from its hands or fingertips, releasing immensely powerful shockwaves and/or energy waves with its voice and an energy bow. It can also form energy shields around its forearms, and create impenetrable spheres of energy in its hands which are used for carrying and protection.\n\nThe RahXephon is also referred to as 翼神世音 (Yokushin Seon), literally \"wing god world sound\". This is essentially a translation of the name \"RahXephon\", and it is also the Chinese term for the series and the mecha.\n\nWhile dormant, the RahXephon's face is shown covered by a pair of large wings which are attached to its forehead; these wings separate and spread when the RahXephon becomes active, and appear to be tied into its overall function. Its forehead features a golden disk, alluding to the sun god Ra and Ollin Tonatiuh. Its eyes are normally red but are occasionally golden with visible irises; it also has a pair of smaller red eyes on its visor. Below its face is an egg-shaped protected barrier which Ayato is absorbed through when entering; he is then dropped through another barrier into the pilot's seat, which resembles a pair of cupped hands emerging from a seemingly endless pool of dark water and contains two control rods.\n\nThe RahXephon is connected physically, mentally, and emotionally to its instrumentalist. Its arms and head mimic Ayato's movements. The field of view from the pilot's seat is a grid of hexagons which follows Ayato's view; the RahXephon's shields also have a hexagonal grid shape. Ayato is shown to be absorbed into the RahXephon in a variety of manners, and it moves on its own to meet Ayato several times. Ayato can also trigger awakening and entering the RahXephon through voice command. Ayato appears to feel damage inflicted on the RahXephon as physical pain. During the battle with the Dolem Forzando, the RahXephon is pierced through the shoulder with a spike of debris; Ayato is shown in the cockpit holding his shoulder in the same place shortly thereafter.\n\nIt is revealed that the RahXephon was created by Ernst von Bähbem as a tool for re-tuning the world. This re-tuning would involve the RahXephon joining with a special person who has the potential to accomplish the re-tuning, referred to as an instrumentalist. The Mu refer to the robot as \"Xephon\", adding the honorific of \"Rah\" near the end of the series when Ayato is ready to tune the world. The RahXephon's TERRA designation is the \"5-A\" OOPArt or \"Mulian Artifact Class 5 A (MA-C5A)\".\n\nThe RahXephons were designed by mecha designers Michiaki Sato and Yoshinori Sayama.\n\nIn the manga, the RahXephon is an artifact mysterious even to the Mu, used in a ritual that grants the desires of its occupants.\n\nMaya Kamina is Ayato's mother and is often away from home, leaving Ayato feeling neglected and wishing to spend more time with her. Although Ayato initially believes she works in a lab, she is actually a very powerful Mulian leader. Just before Ayato leaves Tokyo Jupiter for the first time, Maya is injured by flying debris, and Ayato is severely rattled when he sees her blue blood. From then on, he is fearful and mistrusting of her. Maya reveals that she is actually Ayato's aunt, and that she adopted Ayato. She was originally sent to the human world along with her sister Quon (Ayato's biological mother). The only Mulian that was there before them was Ernst von Bähbem. Maya was raised by Shougo Rikudo while Quon slept in the care of Bähbem. Maya married Rikudo's research assistant, Shirow Watari. When Maya's Mu phase awakened, she left her husband and joined the Mu.\n\nIn the movie, Maya is Ayato's biological mother, and her turn to the Mu is more violent: She ran away while pregnant with Ayato and killed his father.\n\nIn the manga, Maya does not turn from the \"normal\" humans to the Mu. She turns from a kind Mulian who shows compassion for Reika into a malevolent character who tries to kill Reika and stages a coup d'état within the Mulian government. Her agenda is the eradication of red-blooded humans, and she shows far less attachment to Ayato than in the animated versions.\n\nHiroko Asahina is a classmate and friend of Ayato and Mamoru Torugai. During the attack on Tokyo in episode 1, she is lightly injured, and bleeds red blood. While Ayato is in the real world, her Mu phase activates. When Ayato returns to Tokyo Jupiter, Hiroko is relieved to see him again but is distressed by the memory loss resulting from her Mu phase activating and a feeling that Mamoru's explanation for Ayato's absence is not right. Later, she is shot by agents guarding Mamoru; Ayato finds her, and she asks Ayato \"It's red, right?\" while she is covered in blood (now blue) from her wounds. Ayato assures her that her blood is red, but they are afraid to admit to each other its real colour. When Ayato leaves Tokyo Jupiter for the second time, she leaves with him, and the two of them live together for a short time. While she is with Ayato, she has terrifying visions of herself as a Mulian bound to a Dolem, but cannot bring herself to talk about this with Ayato. However, she keeps a diary where she can write down her feelings. Her Dolem Vibrato eventually shows up, and Ayato destroys it, killing Hiroko in the process, which deeply traumatizes Ayato. At the end of the series, when Ayato re-tunes the world, Hiroko is brought back to life along with Mamoru.\n\nIt is revealed, through flashbacks in the series as well as in the movie prologue, that Hiroko was in love with Ayato while they were in their early teens, before Tokyo Jupiter was created, and that her feelings have not subsided even though she is dating Mamoru.\n\nAsahina's role in the movie is identical to that in the TV series.\n\nIn the manga, she is Ayato's tsundere girlfriend; Ayato entered the relationship in part to escape Reika's advances. Here, Asahina escapes from Tokyo Jupiter with refugees and arrives in Nirai Kanai where she projects three Dolem and holds Reika hostage, forcing Ayato to kill her.\n\nMamoru Torigai is another friend and classmate of Kamina's in Tokyo Jupiter. He was seeing Hiroko Asahina before she left Tokyo Jupiter with Ayato. Deep down, he dislikes Ayato because of Asahina's feelings for him. Mamoru is a true Mulian, like Ernst von Bähbem, Maya, and Quon, and holds a high position within the Mulian society. He follows Ayato to Nirai Kanai the second time he leaves Tokyo Jupiter and lives with Ayato for a short period of time. While in Nirai Kanai, Mamoru discovers that Asahina died. He blames Ayato for her death and fights the RahXephon with his Dolem Obbligato. His Dolem is no match for the RahXephon and loses an arm in the battle. He returns with a fully repaired Dolem and battles the RahXephon again, this time after Ayato had joined with the RahXephon, and dies in the battle. He is brought back to life, along with Asahina, when Ayato re-tunes the world.\n\nHis given name, \"Mamoru\", also means \"to protect\" in Japanese. In the light of his failure to protect Asahina and his turning against Ayato, his name becomes ironic.\n\nIn the movie, Mamoru's role is similar to that in the TV series.\n\nIn the manga, Mamoru only appears as a classmate who makes unsuccessful advances towards Asahina.\n\nMasayoshi Kuki appears as second in command to Maya in Tokyo Jupiter. He sometimes questions Maya's orders and also shows some disapproval of how she treats Ayato. It is revealed that Kuki was the JSDF officer that ordered Jin Kunugi to perform the nuclear strike on the Mu in the Great Mu War. Kuki attacks Nirai-Kanai with the Largo, and appears invincible to its defense systems. Kunugi, however, activates a Jupiter device, killing Kuki and enacting his revenge before dying of his injuries.\n\nIn the movie, Kuki also acts as the second in command, but without the history and conflict with Kunugi. He does not appear in the manga.\n\nShinobu Miwa appears to be third in command in the Tokyo Bay base control center. She is shown working with Kuki in the control center, and holding down the fort with other subordinates while Kuki and Maya are away. At the end of the series, Miwa briefly expresses doubt over the Mu agenda before finally becoming bound to the Dolem Allegretto.\n\nIn the movie, Miwa appears briefly in the base.\n\nIn the manga, Maya is shown to have a female second in command, but this character is not named.\n\nJin Kunugi is the stern and quiet commander of TERRA's military operations. He prefers delegating tasks to his subordinates and \"managing by exception\". Kunugi was an officer of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, under the command of Kuki Masayoshi, who ordered him to perform a nuclear strike on the Mu. His daughter Michiru was killed in the following war, and Kunugi became estranged from his wife. It is falsely stated in the anime that his wife is his daughter. It is revealed that Kuki was acting on behalf of the Mu (or some element within the Mu government), who wanted the humans to attack, providing justification for their further plans.\n\nKunugi eventually stays behind after Nirai Kanai is evacuated and activates a Jupiter device there, sacrificing himself to kill Kuki and destroy Largo, the Dolem which was bound to Kuki.\n\nIn the movie, Kunugi's conflict with Kuki is removed, substituting conflict with Bähbem. Kunugi thus takes part of the role Futagami had in the TV series.\n\nIn the manga, Kunugi also appears as the commander, but with little background and drama surrounding his character.\n\nMegumi Shitou is Haruka's younger sister. She initially protests Ayato living with her, Haruka, and their uncle, but she does her best to help Ayato feel at home, and develops a crush on Ayato as the series progresses. She often serves pocky and other snacks, and introduces Ayato to ramune. Although seemingly energetic and upbeat, she has many internal issues. She did not fit in well in school, so she joined TERRA as a trainee. She would later be promoted to the rank of a full officer.\n\nShe initially has a crush on Souchi Yakumo, but gives up on him when she finds out that he is seeing her friend, Kim Hotal. She feels as if she is constantly living in her sister's shadow, and this comes to a head when she learns that Ayato and Haruka had a relationship when they were younger, as by the end of the series she has developed a crush on Ayato. In the end, she openly renounces her feelings for Ayato for the sake of her sister.\n\nIn the movie, as in the series, Megumi helps make Ayato feel at home, but does not fall in love with Ayato or Yakumo — at least not in the scenes shown.\n\nIn the manga, Megumi and Kim have minor roles as classmates, \"bodyguards\", and observers of Reika.\n\nKim Hotal is Megumi's closest friend and a TERRA operative. When Kim was a child, her parents were killed in a Dolem attack in Australia. She joined TERRA in order to take revenge on the Mulians for her parents' deaths.\n\nKim starts seeing Souchi Yakumo, and although she feels guilty for hurting Megumi's feelings when she learns that Megumi likes him too, she is able to work things out with Megumi. It is also strongly hinted that Kim becomes pregnant by Souchi, as she appears to be suffering from morning sickness in two scenes near the end of the series.\n\nIn the movie, Kim is only seen in a short glimpse. In the manga she appears in a couple of scenes with Megumi.\n\nSouichi Yakumo is second in command at TERRA, with the rank of Major. He often takes command when Kunugi is not present. Souichi is fond of Ayato and believes that regardless of whether or not Ayato is a Mulian, he is still himself and thus, should be looked at as an individual. Souichi is kind and friendly to everyone, and Megumi misinterprets this as a chance for a relationship. Soichi is oblivious to Megumi's feelings and starts seeing Kim. Despite being softspoken and friendly, Souichi is an able commanding officer.\n\nLater on in the series, Souichi is killed at the same time as Elvy by Ayato but is brought back after the world is tuned.\n\nIn the movie, Souichi has the same position within TERRA but is shown to be more \"in the know\". He does not appear in the manga.\n\nItsuki Kisaragi is an urbane doctor with TERRA who studies music and is part of the analysis team studying the RahXephon. At first, he appears as the adoptive brother of Quon. It is revealed he is actually Quon's biological son and Ayato's brother. Like Megumi, he feels inferior to his sibling and struggles with his own worth throughout the series. He is unable to pilot the RahXephon, and once dated Haruka (who now rejects him). He was raised in the Bähbem Institute with Makoto Isshiki and Helena von Bähbem. Like Ayato and Quon, he bears the mark of a potential instrumentalist on his stomach.\n\nIn the movie, his character is reduced to being a love-sick guardian of the sleeping Quon.\n\nIn the manga, Itsuki and Haruka are friends and colleagues, and they eventually marry. On their wedding day, it is revealed that Itsuki and Haruka are reincarnations of Ayato and Reika.\n\nSayoko Nanamori is Itsuki's research assistant. She is shown to hold unrequited feelings for Itsuki, and to react angrily if anyone touches on the subject. This leads to a small running gag in the series: Whenever she is particularly upset about Itsuki, the windscreen wiper on her car is shown to make an interval swipe on its own. Episode 8 revolves around Itsuki giving Nanamori a crystal pendant as a Christmas gift; the crystal (taken from the remains of the Dolem Forzando grows into the Dolem Sforzando, absorbs Nanamori, and alters the weather on Nirai Kanai to create blizzard-like conditions matching the state of Nanamori's feelings. She is freed by Ayato in the RahXephon, and later enters into a relationship with Makoto Isshiki and supplies him with information, thus unwittingly keeping the Bähbem Foundation abreast of Quon's status. Nanamori struggles with memories of her family, but it is later revealed that she was given false memories and was programmed by Bähbem to love Itsuki. Nanamori ends up killing Itsuki by stabbing him. Distraught over Itsuki's murder and the truth of her false memories, she kills herself.\n\nIn the movie, Nanamori appears only in a glimpse. In the manga, Nanamori is a malevolent Mu agent and facilitates Ayato's escape from TERRA.\n\nElvy Hadhiyat is an ace pilot for TERRA, and participated in the operation to extract Ayato from Tokyo Jupiter in episode 1. She is from Indonesia and is Haruka's drinking buddy. At first she pilots a high-tech jet fighter equipped with a booster that enables her to pass through the Tokyo Jupiter barrier. Later on, she pilots the Vermilion, a Dolem given to TERRA based on the RahXephon.\n\nHer nickname is \"Bunga Mawar\", meaning \"Rose Blossom\" in Indonesian. She has a handkerchief monogrammed with her nickname and a rose emblem. In the scene where this appears she can also be seen wearing a baseball cap with a rose design on the crown. Elvy parallels Lydia Litvyak, a World War II female fighter ace nicknamed the \"White Rose of Stalingrad\" and the namesake of the ship in the series.\n\nAlthough Elvy initially flirts with Ayato and fights to protect him from danger, she becomes very hostile once she finds out that he is a Mulian. She uses the Vermilion to follow Ayato when he returns to Tokyo Jupiter. She is later killed in battle against the Mu when Ayato unites with the RahXephon and sings a 'song' which produces a wave of destruction that destroys her aircraft, surrounding Dolems and various TERRA sea vessels. Elvy, like others who died, is returned to life when the world is re-tuned.\n\nElvy appears in both the movie and the manga.\n\nElvy loses her entire squadron in the first episode, and a new group of pilots is taken on as replacements in episode 7; these pilots are all longtime associates of Elvy's. They are first equipped with advanced fighter planes and eventually receive a Vermilion from the Bähbem Foundation. They do not appear in the manga or movie versions.\n\nMakoto Isshiki, called \"The White Snake\" because of his albinism and personality, is sent by the Earth Federation to observe at TERRA. He has an extremely haughty and arrogant attitude, and is contemptuous and dismissive of Ayato. His cover is rather shallow, as it is easily discovered that he was sent at the request of the Bähbem Foundation.\n\nWhen Isshiki was younger, he had long hair and was quite close to Itsuki. During childhood he found an experimental Dolem in the caverns below the Bähbem Institute where he was being raised. He was able to connect with the Dolem and tried to get it to find its 'mom and dad' but became heartbroken when he realized that, like him, it had no true mother or father. He is a clone sharing the DNA of Ernst von Bähbem. He has an inferiority complex which stems from being a D-ranked instrumentalist. He had abilities beyond what was expected of a D type, but he failed to recognize praise from others and let the \"D\" rating stop him. Because of this, he hates being called a D type, and he feels that he has to constantly prove himself. Isshiki also hates Mulians and considers them worthless, not realising that he is Mulian himself.\n\nIsshiki has Kunugi removed from his command position, and leads Operation Downfall to destroy the Tokyo Jupiter barrier. Although the operation is successful, it results in a horrific counterattack by the Mu, causing massive losses to TERRA. It is revealed that he deliberately ignored an order from the Earth Federation not to go through with the operation; he is deposed and imprisoned. Driven to madness, he escapes his cell at the Bähbem Foundation and goes on a killing spree against his fellow clones, and is finally shot to death by Laila Costa, one of Bähbem's assistants.\n\nA number of other D clones appear throughout the series, perhaps to confuse the viewer.\n\nIsshiki appears in the movie only as the head of the Strategic Division of TERRA and the leader of Operation Downfall (J-Buster). He is not shown to have any history with Helena and Itsuki.\n\nHe does not appear in the manga.\n\nShirou Watari is the director of TERRA, and spends a lot of time on the road facing the press, lobbying for the organization, and coordinating with the Bähbem Foundation. Though his public persona is as stern and serious as that of his friend Jin Kunugi, he is more cheerful around the other TERRA employees; the souvenirs he buys for the employees is a running joke in the series. Watari was the assistant of Professor Rikudo, and they found Quon and Maya together. Shirou Kamina eventually married Maya, but he changed his family name to Watari after Maya had gone over to the Mu. Watari is the biological father of Ayato and Itsuki. He was initially hesitant to meet Ayato. During his first meeting he subtly alludes to their relationship, which Ayato did not pick up on.\n\nIn the movie, Watari is still Ayato's biological father, but the pregnancy was unplanned and fully in utero. Watari escaped with Maya, but she was being turned to the Mu and appears to have killed him during the escape.\n\nHe does not appear in the manga.\n\nMasaru Gomi and Youhei Yomoda work with Haruka, Megumi and Kim in TERRA's operations room. Little is known about them except that they are devoted fans and defenders of Quon.\n\nThe staff is larger than those four, and other operators are shown speaking, but none are named or even appear in more than one episode.\n\nGomi appears briefly in the movie, while Yomoda is cut. Neither appears in the manga.\n\nShougo Rikudo is a retired archaeologist living in Nirai-Kanai. He is the uncle of Haruka and Megumi, and welcomes Ayato into his household. Soft-spoken and wise, he helps to ground the other characters. He is an expert at shogi and at Japanese calligraphy. It is revealed that it was Professor Rikudo and his assistant Shirow Watari who found Maya and Quon at the shrine, and that Maya was raised as Rikudo's adoptive daughter, making him Ayato's grandfather.\n\nRikudo has an equally prominent position in the movie as in the series, and he takes on a greater importance in telling the story. In the movie, he is the one to encourage Haruka to join Ayato.\n\nHe does not appear in the manga.\n\nJohji Futagami is a Columbo-like reporter from Amato News who is given exclusive press access to TERRA, making his way around the island of Nirai Kanai asking questions of both principal characters and other local residents. Throughout the series, he is able to supply new information to Haruka, while being involved in investigative journalism. He eventually goes on his own hunt for Ayato and Asahina after their escape from Tokyo Jupiter. It is revealed that his real name is Takeshi Jumonji, and that he is a high ranking intelligence officer with the Earth Federation. In the endgame, he relays orders to the combined TERRA/Federation fleet and tracks down and kills Ernst von Bähbem.\n\nFutagami does not appear in the movie or the manga.\n\nErnst von Bähbem, also called \"The Designer\", is the cloned host body of an ancient Mulian. His practice of cloning himself has some characters mistakenly calling him a modern Methuselah. Bähbem was responsible for the continent of Mu disappearing into another dimension, and he seeks to rectify the situation by having the world \"re-tuned\" before the dimensions destroy each other and turn into \"mud\". Bähbem seems not to care about whether the humans or the Mu are the ones that will succeed in the tuning, or indeed care about the people that he uses to attain his goals. He is later shot and killed by Johji Futagami.\n\nIn the movie, Bähbem has the stated goal of seeing the Mu prevail in the tuning; his role is otherwise similar to that in the series.\n\nNeither Bähbem nor his foundation appear in the manga.\n\nHelena von Bähbem is the niece of Ernst von Bähbem. A childhood acquaintance of Makoto Isshiki and Itsuki Kisaragi, she serves as the second in command in the Bähbem Foundation. In addition to being a childhood dabbler in witchcraft, she was a potential instrumentalist, but passed the ideal age without realising her potential. This makes her jealous of Quon and others that might succeed in tuning the world. She eventually allows Ernst von Bähbem to take over her body.\n\nHelena appears briefly with Ernst in the movie.\n\nShe does not appear in the manga.\n\n\nShe does not appear in the movie or manga.\n\n"}

Openly bisexual, Collard was also one of the first French artists to speak openly about his HIV-positive status.\n\nCollard was born into a liberal, middle-class family in France.

{"id": "2074617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074617", "title": "Borinage", "text": "Borinage\n\nThe Borinage is an area in the Walloon province of Hainaut in Belgium. The provincial capital Mons is located in the east of the Borinage. In French the inhabitants are called \"Borains\", but there was a great sociological difference between Mons and the \"Borains\" of all the villages around Mons. \n\nCharles White wrote, when describing the Belgian revolution, \"The Borains, like the dark spirits of the melo-drame, rose from their mines, and helter-skelter pushed upon the capital\", but he was using this name for all the inhabitants in the Province of Hainaut, which is an error.\n\n\"From the 18th century to 1850, the economy of thirty municipalities in the Borinage was founded on coal mining. Between 1822 and 1829, production more than doubled in that region i.e. from 602,000 to 1,260,000 tons. That was more than the total production of France and Germany at the time. The Borinage exported its coal mostly to France and Flanders.\"\" \n\nIn 1957, out of 64,800 people recorded as being in employment in the Borinage, 23,000 worked in the coal industry. Only 7,000 people in services, although in Belgium as a whole, 49 percent of employment was in the tertiary sector. \n\nIn the 1960s, because of the end of the collieries, Ladrière, Meynaud and Perin wrote that the Borinage died in the ideological and economical sense. \n\nIn his mid-twenties, Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh spent several years living in the Borinage, ca. 1878–1880. He initially preached to and lived among the coal miners, later suffering a breakdown and deciding to become an artist. His first masterpiece, \"The Potato Eaters\" (Oil on Canvas, 1885), of Dutch peasants, although not painted there, was indirectly inspired by the bad conditions of the miners and their families in the Borinage.\n\nDutch-born Belgian painter Henry Luyten resided in the Borinage between 1886 and 1887. He witnessed the great strike and its bloody suppression. In response, he painted the triptych \"The Strike\" on which he worked until 1893. The painting (international title: \"Struggle for Life\") measures 3 to 5 meters. The painting on the right-hand panel (3 by 2 ½ meters) is called \"After the uprising\" and the left-hand panel is called \"Misery\".\n\nThis region was emblematic of the whole Sillon industriel in Wallonia and of the Belgian general strikes which often broke out in the Borinage. For instance the Belgian general strike of 1893 was initiated by the \"Borains\" according to Marcel Liebman.\n\nThe area is best known for its former coalmining industry. The living conditions of the miners were featured in the famous documentary film \"Misère au Borinage\" (1933) made by Henri Storck and Joris Ivens.\nIt is one of the most important references in the documentary genre. In 1932, a great strike paralysed the coalmines of Wallonia and the response of employers and the police had been merciless. Throughout it all the broader population was ill-informed and largely indifferent. André Thirifays, Pierre Vermeylen and all the indignant young people involved in the Club de l'écran, decided to bear witness to this dire poverty using their weapon, the camera. With the aid of a doctor and a lawyer, with very little funding, hiding from the police but supported by the whole population, the shoot took place in difficult and exciting conditions. The film is hard, magnificent. It has lost nothing of its force, its strong emotional impact of indignation and compassion. It has left to the working class the strongest images of its history and struggles: evictions;thin-faced and absent-looking children packed together in slum houses; the procession with the portrait of Karl Marx; the collecting of low grade coal on the slagheaps at dawn; the begging miner etc. There is also the shock of images placed side by side: houses standing empty while homeless people sleep in the street, near-famine conditions with no aid, whereas big sums of money go to construct a church...\n\nBorinage is often considered the western end of the sillon industriel, the former industrial backbone of Wallonia, home to about two-thirds of Wallonia's population. \n\nSince the last mines closed in the 1960s, the Borinage has had the highest unemployment ratio of Belgium.\n\nGoogle has its major European datacenter in Saint-Ghislain. \n\nThe listed mine complex of Grand Hornu is a witness of the region's history. It is also the most important museum of Contemporary art in Wallonia.\n\nIn Frameries is a Scientific adventures park around the Crachet's reconstructed Pit head frame.\n\n"}

Schumann initially intended to publish \"Kinderszenen\" together with \"Novelletten\" (Opus 21); the shared literary theme is suggested by the original title \"Kindergeschichten\" (Children's Tales). He told his wife Clara that the \"thirty small, droll things\", most of them less than a page in length, were inspired by her comment that he sometimes seemed \"like a child\". He described them in 1840 as \"more cheerful, gentler, more melodic\" than his earlier works.\n\nMovement No. 7 of the work, ', is one of Schumann's best known pieces; it is the opening and closing musical theme of the 1947 Hollywood film \"Song of Love\", and ' is the title of a 1944 German biographical film on Schumann. In Russia, a hummed choral a cappella version became known as mourning music, being played annually during the Minute of Silence on Victory Day. \n\nOriginally called \"Leichte Stücke\" (\"Easy Pieces\"), the section titles were only added after the completion of the composition, and Schumann described them as \"nothing more than delicate hints for execution and interpretation\". Timothy D. Taylor, however, has discussed the choice of titles for this work in the context of the changing situation of music culturally and economically, stating that the final movement, entitled \"Der Dichter spricht\" (The Poet Speaks), marked a realisation among composers that, due to the decline of patronage structures in the 19th century, their musical works must take on new meanings.\n\nThere is no known complete manuscript of \"Kinderszenen\".\n\n"}

In 1870 it became known as the Workmen's Peace Association, only later becoming the International Arbitration League. \n\nThe organisation was run by men from working-class labouring backgrounds who were against increases in military spending or intervention in continental wars. It promoted a \"high court of nations\" and the development of international law. \nIt was funded by the Peace Society for its first years, which was a primarily Christian organisation that sought absolute pacifism. Instead the League sought out arbitration, which was familiar with its membership, as the approach was known to work in labour disputes. From 1889 it promoted disarmament, rather than absolute pacifism. \n\nThe radical reformer Howard Evans was at various times its chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and treasurer. He wrote its manifesto, and its first article was the establishment of “High Court of Nations”. He was also the editor of its journal, \"The Arbitrator\" from 1872. \nIt expanded out to Paris and soon had agents covering large parts of Europe. \n\nDuring World War One it supported the use of armies by the Allies as a defensive measure.

Its modern name means \"Mother of Pots\" as the whole area is littered with the broken pot shards of offerings made in earlier times. The cultic ancient name of the area was \"(w-)pkr\" or \"(rꜣ-)pkr\" \"District of the pkr[-tree]\" (an unidentified species) or \"Opening of the pkr[-tree]\" (Coptic: \"upoke\"), belonging to \"tꜣ-dsr\" \"the secluded/cleared land\" (necropolis) or \"crk-hh\" \"Binding of Eternity\" (Coptic: \"Alkhah\").\n\nThe area was a site of veneration and worship in ancient Egypt, and by the time of the Middle Kingdom, at least one of the royal tombs was excavated and rebuilt for the priests of Osiris. \n\nThe tombs of this area were first excavated by Émile Amélineau in the 1890s and more systematically by Flinders Petrie between 1899-1901. Since then the area has been excavated repeatedly by the German Archaeological Institute since the 1970s, which has allowed for a thorough reconstruction of the original layout and appearance of these tombs.\n\n\nKnown as \"Cemetery B\", this area contains the Early Dynastic tombs of the pharaohs of the First Dynasty of Egypt and the last two kings of the Second Dynasty.\n\n\nThe last two kings of the Second Dynasty returned to be buried near to their ancestors - they also revived the practice of building mud-brick funerary enclosures nearby.\n\n\nHuman sacrifice was practiced as part of the funerary rituals associated with the first dynasty.

{"id": "2074631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074631", "title": "Tribute (song)", "text": "Tribute (song)\n\n\"Tribute\" is the first single of Tenacious D's self-titled debut album, released on July 16, 2002. The song is a tribute to what Kyle Gass and Jack Black refer to as \"The Best Song in the World\" (often confused as the song's title), which Tenacious D themselves came up with but have since forgotten.\n\nUpon its release, \"Tribute\" failed to make a commercial impact in the United States, but it became a major hit in Australia and New Zealand, peaking at number four on the Australian Singles Chart and number nine on the New Zealand Singles Chart. In Europe, the single charted in the Netherlands, reaching number 25 on the Dutch Top 40, and in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 84 in May 2012. The song is certified Platinum in Australia and Gold in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Tribute\" was the first song Black and Gass played live as Tenacious D. The song, like many other songs that were recorded on \"Tenacious D\", was originally performed on their short-lived HBO TV series. During earlier performances of this song Kyle Gass played the opening to \"Stairway to Heaven\". The two songs are both in A minor and have very similar chord progressions, and critics have said the songs sound alike.\n\nThe song chronicles the band members' encounter with a demon who demands the duo play \"the best song in the world\" or have their souls eaten. Having nothing to lose from trying, they play \"the first thing that came to [their] heads\", which \"just so happened to be the best song in the world.\"\n\nGiven the \"Stairway to Heaven\" interlude in the original TV series version, along with the similarity of the chord progression in both songs, \"Tribute\" at first implies that the best song in the world is indeed that song. However, the lyrics make clear that \"Tribute\" sounds nothing like the song they came up with to please the demon; as Black describes: \"And the peculiar thing is this my friends: The song we sang on that fateful night, it didn't actually sound anything like this song.\"\n\nIn an interview the band claimed that the inspiration from the song came after Jack Black played Metallica's \"One\" for Kyle Gass, describing it as \"the best song in the world\", leading to a failed attempt to themselves write an even better song, and a discussion of the meaninglessness of labeling any song that way. \"Tribute\" was written as a paean to the impossibility of reaching musical perfection, making the claim that the greatest song in the world had in fact been theirs, but that they had forgotten it.\n\nIn \"Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny\", it is implied that the climax of the movie, a rock-off challenge between Satan and Tenacious D told through the song \"Beelzeboss (The Final Showdown)\", is the incident chronicled in \"Tribute\", and that the portion of \"Beelzeboss\" performed by Tenacious D is the song receiving tribute. After defeating Satan, Jack and Kyle recall the incident once more, describing it as, \"the greatest song in the world\". Unfortunately, they are unable to remember how it went. Also in the song \"Beelzeboss\", they mention that they know the demon's weakness, referred to as their \"rocket sauce\", which is what they use in their HBO television series to defeat the demon. However, unlike the demon in the television episode, Satan says they are \"Fuckin' lame\" and tries to take Kyle Gass to hell after all, while the demon asks if they are angels. However, considering that they do not remember the song, they may have forgotten this as well. This was confirmed in a commentary with Jack Black for the movie.\n\nThe music video for \"Tribute\", directed and edited by Liam Lynch, features Jack Black and Kyle Gass, in a cheap shopping mall karaoke booth, rewired to record their song.\n\nAs they sing, the video cuts between footage of the pair walking down the \"long, lonesome road\" and the encounter with the demon played by Dave Grohl. The demon also performs the electric guitar solo in the music video. After the solo, Black and Gass jump out of the booth and start shouting the lyrics at mall shoppers and dancing flamboyantly. Passersby include cameos from Lynch and Ben Stiller. While most pay no attention, an old lady, played by Linda Porter assaults Black with her purse after he grabs her while singing. A policeman, played by JR Reed, who played \"Lee\" in the band's television series, takes Black and Gass away. At the end the same old lady who was frightened by the duo picks up the now-recorded CD, eyes glowing red, and cackles demonically.\n\nAlthough the video had huge success on UK television, the song was never actually released there as a single. \"Tribute\" was nominated for two Music Video Production Association Awards: \"Alternative Video of the Year\" and \"Directorial Debut of the Year\".

It was released in September 2001 as the second single from their self-titled debut album. The song peaked at number 36 in the UK and number 44 in Australia; the video, directed by Spike Jonze, was also well received.\n\nStrings were played by Andrew Gross, a classmate of Jack Black, who penned the orchestral score for \"Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny\". He also played strings on several songs on this album.\n\nJack Black's friend Buckethead covered the song occasionally when playing live.\n\nThe lyrics of the song tell the tale of the superhero Wonderboy (Black) as he forms an alliance with his lute-wielding arch-rival Young Nasty Man (KG) and forms the band Tenacious D. Wonderboy's powers are not revealed in the song but according to the lyrics we know that Young Nasty Man has powers that are \"comparable\" to Wonderboy's. Young Nasty Man has a variety of seemingly telekinetic powers, such as flight via levitation, \"mind bullets\" via telekinesis (with an apparent range of at least 200 yards and enough force to \"kill a yak\"), and \"the power to move you\". The song also mentions Wonderboy's castle made of clouds, the use of swords, and an attempt to destroy a hydra (The Mucky Muck Man), which is not seen in the video, but is mentioned in the song.\n\nIn the video, Wonderboy and Young Nasty Man are portrayed as Medieval/Mythological skill-and-strength heroes, climbing a snowy mountain. At the end of the video they fight a monster (which is off-screen but its flaming breath can be seen) and Wonderboy perishes, having been run through by his own sword. The fates of Young Nasty Man and the monster (presumably the fire-breathing hydra mentioned in the lyrics) remain unknown.\n\nThe video was directed by Spike Jonze under the alias of Marcus Von Bueler. The producer was Vincent Landay and K.K. Barrett was the stunt director. The production company was Satellite Films. The music video was first aired during the week beginning October 29, 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Spike Jonze won an award from the MVPA (Music Video Production Association) for the \"Best Direction of a New Artist\" for his work on \"Wonderboy\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074640", "title": "Earth Song", "text": "Earth Song\n\n\"Earth Song\" is a song by American singer Michael Jackson from his ninth studio album \"\". It was released on November 27, 1995 as the third single from the album. It is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues, gospel and opera. Jackson had a long history of releasing socially conscious material such as \"We Are the World\", \"Man in the Mirror\" and \"Heal the World\". However, \"Earth Song\" was the first that overtly dealt with the environment and animal welfare. \"Earth Song\" was made for the \"Dangerous\" album but it failed to make the final cut. The song was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell.\n\n\"Earth Song\" was accompanied by a lavish music video shot in four geographical regions. The video centered on the destruction and rebirth of Earth and went on to receive a Grammy nomination in 1997. The song went number one in the United Kingdom, and was the nation's number-one Christmas single in 1995. It also topped the charts in Germany, Iceland, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland while peaking at number two in France, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Jackson went on to receive recognition from various animal and environmental organizations.\n\nIn 2011, the song was paired with the poem \"Planet Earth\" (previously released on \"Michael Jackson's This Is It\", in 2009) and released as a song in the remix album \"Immortal\".\n\nJackson already had a history of charitable or socially conscious material. As a child, he recorded the song \"In Our Small Way\" for his first album \"Got to Be There\" in 1971. As an adult, he used his fame and wealth to promote various causes. In 1985, he co-wrote the charity single \"We Are the World\" with Lionel Richie, which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. The single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20 million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief. It was also the first time Jackson was seen as a humanitarian. All of the profits from his single \"Man in the Mirror\" went to charity. Jackson founded the \"Heal the World Foundation\" in 1992, inspired by his charity single of the same name.\n\nFollowing the illness and death of Ryan White, Jackson helped draw public attention to HIV/AIDS, something that was still controversial at the time. He publicly pleaded with the Clinton Administration at Bill Clinton's Inaugural Gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research. He would go on to perform the song \"Gone Too Soon\" for White and other victims of the illness.\n\n\"Earth Song\" was written by Jackson in the Hotel Imperial in Vienna, Austria under the working title \"What About Us\". An early version, which featured Jackson singing the ending in falsetto, was set to be released as part of a bonus disc for the remastered \"Dangerous\" album in 2001 but the release was cancelled; that version along with other tracks were leaked on the Internet.\n\n\"Earth Song\" was produced by Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Andrae Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale. Jackson's intent was to create a song that was lyrically deep yet melodically simple, so the whole world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could sing along. He conceptualized a song that had an emotional message.\n\n\"Earth Song\" is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues, gospel and opera. In the socially conscious track, Jackson issues a wakeup-call about the dire situations that mankind has caused and is facing, ranging from war to devastation to animals and earth itself. The song reveals itself to be highly spiritual at the end where Jackson calls on people to remember the earth is their inheritance from God via their ancestor Abraham. \"What about death again\" reminds all to think about eternal death, asking people to check their heart for repentance, or to see if they really cared at all. Having disfellowshipped himself from Jehovah's Witnesses, Jackson simplified his faith to focus on the Biblical Jesus Christ until his death. The song is written in the key of G minor, but later modulates to B minor . \n\"Earth Song\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. James Hunter of \"Rolling Stone\" stated, \"The slow blues-operatic 'Earth Song' for all its noble sentiments, sounds primarily like a showpiece\". A \"San Jose Mercury News\" review called it \"flat\" and \"whiny\", believing Jackson had already experimented with these concepts earlier in his career.\n\n\"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" described the track as \"a healing, rhythmic ballad that evokes religious imagery\". A review in \"The Sacramento Bee\" was favorable, describing Jackson's vocal performance as \"cool\". Michael Mehle of \"Rocky Mountain News\" described the finale as \"anthemic\" and a \"powerful gospel opus\". A \"Ledger-Enquirer\" review observed of \"Earth Song\", \"[it] enjoys the same kind of subtlety, building to a dramatic call-and-response finish with the Andrae Crouch Choir\". \"Contra Costa Times\"'s review called it \"a bit sappy and overblown\" but also acknowledged that it was \"epic\" and destined to be a \"massive smash hit\".\n\nIn 2017, ShortList's Dave Fawbert listed the song as containing \"one of the greatest key changes in music history\".\n\nJackson received the Genesis Award: 1995 Doris Day Music Award, given each year for animal sensitivity. In 2008, a writer for the Nigeria Exchange noted, \"'Earth Song' drew the world's attention to the degradation and bastardization of the earth as a fall out of various human activities\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Earth Song\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, where it remained for six weeks throughout December 1995 — beating the U2/Brian Eno project Passengers to win the Christmas number one spot — and into early 1996. During its stay at number one, \"Earth Song\" kept the first single released by the Beatles in 25 years, \"Free as a Bird\", off the number one position. In early December, bookmakers correctly predicted that Jackson would keep the Beatles off the top position and go on to attain the Christmas number-one single. It went on to sell 1,210,297 copies in the nation as of September 2017.\n\nThe song also took the number one position in Iceland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, peaking within the top five in almost every European state.\nIn Germany, it was Jackson's first single to reach No. 1 on the German Singles Chart and held the summit for 5 consecutive weeks.\n\nThe song was only released to radio in the US, appearing on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In 2006, \"Earth Song\" reached number 55 on the European Hot 100 Singles chart, following the \"\" campaign, whereby 20 of Jackson's hit singles from the 1980s to the 1990s were reissued in several European countries.\n\nThe music video for \"Earth Song\", directed by fine art photographer Nick Brandt, was expensive and well-received; it gained a \"Le Film Fantastique: Best Video Award\" in 1996, the 1995 Doris Day Music Award at the Genesis Awards and a Grammy nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form in 1997. The production had an environmental theme, showing images of animal cruelty, deforestation, pollution, poaching, poverty and war. Jackson and the world's people unite in a spiritual chant—\"Earth Song\"—which summons a force that heals the world. Using special effects, time is reversed so that life returns, war ends and the forests regrow. The video closes with a request for donations to Jackson's Heal the World Foundation. The clip was shown infrequently in the United States.\n\nThe video was filmed in four geographic regions (Americas, Europe and Africa). The first location was the Amazon Rainforest, where a large part was destroyed a week after the video's completion. Natives of the region appeared in the video and were not actors. The second scene was a war zone in Karlovac, Croatia, with famous Serbian actor Slobodan Dimitrijević and the residents of the area. The third location was Tanzania, which incorporated scenes of illegal poaching and hunting into the video. No animals were harmed in the making of the \"Earth Song\", as the footage came from documentary archives. The final location was in Warwick, New York, where a safe forest fire was simulated in a corn field.\n\nThe video was also included on the video albums: \"HIStory on Film, Volume II\", \"Number Ones\" and \"Michael Jackson's Vision\".\n\nEarth Song was first performed on November 4, 1995 on the German TV station, Wetten, dass..?, along with Dangerous. The next performance of the song was at the Brit Awards on February 19, 1996. During the performance, singer Jarvis Cocker ran onto the stage while Jackson was dangling off the edge of the crane. He lifted his shirt, pretended to break wind and gave Jackson the V-sign. The 1996 World Music Awards was the next performance of the song on May 8, 1996. During the ending of the song, Jackson sang the line, \"Tell me what about it\", which was not heard in the song. On July 16, 1996, Jackson performed Earth Song at the Brunei Royal Concert at Jerudong Park Amphitheatre in Bandar Seri Begawan. Similar to the World Music Awards performance, Michael sang the line, \"Tell me what about it\". The song was also performed on Jackson's HIStory World Tour from September 1996 to October 1997. It was later performed at the MJ & Friends concerts in June 1999. During the Munich performance on June 27, 1999, the middle section of the bridge collapsed into the air and came falling down instead of pausing in mid-air. The fall caused severe back pain to Jackson. After the concert, Jackson was rushed to a hospital. The song was also planned for his This Is It concerts in 2009 but were cancelled due to Jackson's death. This was the last song Jackson ever performed, having rehearsed it on June 24, 2009, preparing for This Is It, hours before his death.\n\nOn February 19, 1996, Jackson performed \"Earth Song\" at the Brit Awards in the United Kingdom; he was there to collect a special \"Artist of a Generation\" award. Jackson sang while dangling off the edge of a high rise crane elevator, which he had used the year before while performing it on the German TV show Wetten Dass. Below, a chorus of backing performers joined in and many began to embrace Jackson upon his descent.\n\nDuring the performance, singer Jarvis Cocker ran onstage without permission, lifted his shirt and pretended to break wind, before giving Jackson the V-sign. Cocker was there with his band Pulp, who had been nominated for three Brit awards. He was questioned by police over claims he had assaulted some of the child performers, but he was released without charge. Cocker stated that he found the performance offensive, claiming that Jackson had portrayed himself as Christ-like and could do as he pleased because of his immense wealth and power. However, he clarified that his actions weren't personally against Jackson himself, just the performance. He stated that he admired Jackson as a performer, proclaiming that: ″He can dance, [...] anybody who invents the moonwalk is alright by me″. He even later claimed to be a Michael Jackson fan in 2010. Jackson condemned Cocker's behavior as \"disgusting and cowardly\". The incident is referred to in the book \"Politics and Popular Culture\" by John Street, Professor of Politics at the University of East Anglia. He says:\nBut to read popular culture as a straight-forward – or at least typical – political text is to take a very narrow view of its meaning, and hence of its political message(s). As we have noted, the text's meaning will depend on how it is heard and read. Michael Jackson may have intended his \"Earth Song\" as an exercise in compassion; others – like Jarvis Cocker – saw it quite differently. One reason these alternative readings emerge is because of the way the performance of popular culture engages more than a literal text, it employs gestures and symbols, tones of voice, looks and glances, all of which might tell a different story.\nThe song, along with a 3-D short film that was to be featured in Jackson's series of comeback concerts This Is It was performed as a tribute to Jackson. Jennifer Hudson, Carrie Underwood, Smokey Robinson, Celine Dion and Usher all sang the song together, while the video played in the background. The film was shown in its original 3-D format during the broadcast.\n\nTarget provided free 3-D glasses to customers a week before the Grammy Awards. Paris and Prince Jackson, Jackson's oldest children, appeared shortly after the performance to accept Jackson's Lifetime Achievement Award, where they both gave a short speech. This was the first time the children had spoken publicly since the memorial service that was held for Jackson on July 7, 2009.\n\nUK CD1\n\nUK CD2\n\nEarth Song (Hani Remixes)\n\n\n\n\n"}

The north is largely separated from the flatter southern half by Loch Mòr (big loch) and a strip of sand dunes.\n\nThe island was occupied from prehistoric times.

The video was a major success, going 6× platinum in the US and 2× platinum in Australia in the Video Longform category. The disc's cover features band members Jack Black and Kyle Gass in Baroque era costume, complete with powdered wigs, a violin and harpsichord.\n\nJack Black and Kyle Gass, except where noted.\n\n\nIn this episode the D has to write a new song before their next appearance at the Open-mic Bar. After days of procrastinating they are still unable to write a song, this causes Jack to get angry and yell at Kyle. Kyle gets tired of Jack's attitude and quits the band, Jack becomes upset and breaks down, the band gets back together a week later, and they become inspired to write the song, \"Kyle Quit the Band\".\nIn this episode Jack falls in love with a girl named Florna, he tells Kyle how he's incredibly attracted to her because of her interest in Satan, the fact that she has her spine pierced, and because she likes to clog dance. Jack then tells Kyle that his relationship with Florna will never affect their friendship in any way and gives Kyle a Best Friends Forever medallion symbolizing their unbreakable friendship. Kyle then becomes attracted to Florna too due to Jack's descriptions of her. When Jack finds out he becomes angry and karate kicks Kyle. As the two fight they fail to notice a robber go into Captain Ed's Records, where Florna works. The robber exits the store with Florna at gunpoint and Jack demands her release. The robber attempts to shoot Jack but just as he pulls the trigger Kyle jumps in the way shielding Jack from harm. Jack mourns over Kyle believing he is dead, but Kyle then reveals himself to be alive due to the friendship medallion that he was still wearing which actually shielded him from the bullet.\nIn this episode The D meets a veteran rocker at Captain Eds Records. He tells them of his wild experiences on the road with the many bands he has toured with, he then explains to them that the rock star life will get them nowhere, just like if you believe in the Easter Bunny or the Sasquatch, and that they will soon end up a failure just like him. They don't believe what he tells them and they continue to try to keep their rock star dream alive, but they soon realize that their dream has truly died. They go into the forest to burn their band merchandise when they are approached by Sasquatch. They realized that Captain Ed had been wrong about everything and that there is still hope for The D.\nIn this episode Jack and Kyle get a new neighbor. As they commence their pre-show rituals they make too much noise and disturb their neighbor who is trying to concentrate on his writing. He calls the police to complain about the noise so The D tells the police officer their side of the story, in song. As the song ends the police officer says that he has heard enough. As he leaves he tells the man not to call them again unless he has a \"good\" reason to which he responds, \"But I'm a writer!\".\nIn this episode The D meets their biggest fan, Lee.

A man comes over and offers to buy, but the D turn him down, claiming \"It's only for the ladies\". However, this man explains that he is a collector of rock star sperm, so they let him buy the sperm. Another man then buys it, but when asked if he too is a collector, he says \"no\" and drinks the sperm. When asked why he drank it, he says, \"Its good for your throat. It helps you sing better, like Rod Stewart.\" Within two seconds of leaving the stall, the man passes out. Kyle wants to see if what the man claims is true, so he drinks a cup.

{"id": "2074655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074655", "title": "2005 United States Grand Prix", "text": "2005 United States Grand Prix\n\nThe 2005 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on June 19, 2005, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and was the ninth race of the 2005 FIA Formula One World Championship. The event is one of the most controversial Formula One motor races in modern history. Out of the 20 cars that entered the race, only the six cars from the teams using Bridgestone tyres (Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi) competed. The remaining fourteen entrants, all using Michelin tyres, completed the parade lap, but retired to the pits before the race started.\n\nFollowing several tyre failures before the race, which caused major accidents for Ralf Schumacher's Toyota during Friday practice and Ricardo Zonta in the other Toyota, Michelin advised its seven customer teams that without a reduction in speed in Turn 13, the tyres provided for the race would only be safe for 10 laps. Michelin had been providing working tyres for the race since 2001. The situation was worsened by the 2005 Formula One rules, which forbade tyre changes during the race, and a repave of the oval portion of the course after the 2004 Brickyard 400.\n\nThe Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's governing body, refused a compromise proposal from Michelin to allow a chicane to be installed, maintaining that such rule changes would be grossly unfair to the Bridgestone-shod teams, who had come prepared with properly working tyres, and that a last-minute change to the track layout would be dangerous in case of crashes. The Michelin teams, unable to come to a compromise with the FIA, decided not to participate. It was later stated that the Michelin-shod teams could have potentially exposed themselves to criminal liability under Indiana state law had they competed. It was also thought that since Bridgestone also provided tyres to the two Indy Racing League series (IndyCar Series and Infiniti Pro Series) via its Firestone brand, and had encountered issues during testing that caused them to return with different IndyCar tyres, it understood better the loads the Formula One tyres would be under. Thus, Bridgestone was able to provide a proper tyre.\n\nOf the six competitors, Ferrari's Michael Schumacher was the eventual winner, with his teammate Rubens Barrichello finishing second. The result significantly boosted Schumacher's championship standing, placing him third overall—no driver above him in driver championship points took part in the race. The final race result was the lowest number of finishing entries ever seen in a major open-wheel motorsports event at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since the institution of the 500-Mile Race (surpassing the previous record low of seven finishers in 1966, a race marred by a major first lap accident that eliminated a full third of the starting field). The situation created enormous negative publicity for the sport of Formula One, especially in the United States, a market in which Formula One had struggled to establish itself over the preceding twenty years; some even called the race \"Indygate\".\n\nThe qualifying session for the United States Grand Prix was held on June 18. Jarno Trulli gained the pole position by posting the fastest lap time, 1:10.625. Trulli, driving for Toyota, was the team's first driver to win the pole position for a Formula One race. The second-place qualifier was Kimi Räikkönen, who ran a lap of 1:10.694. Jenson Button, Giancarlo Fisichella, and Michael Schumacher were the next three fastest qualifiers. Fernando Alonso, who led the season point standings, qualified in sixth. The rest of the top 10 consisted of Rubens Barrichello, Takuma Sato, Mark Webber, and Felipe Massa.\n\nDuring the afternoon's practice session on Friday, June 17, 2005, Ralf Schumacher, driving for Toyota, crashed badly in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, as a result of a left-rear tyre failure. He was unable to continue racing, and was replaced by the team's test driver, Ricardo Zonta, for the rest of the weekend. Schumacher had crashed in the same spot as a result of a tyre failure the previous year, while driving for the Williams team. Turn 13 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course is a high-speed banked turn, unique in Formula One racing, which causes a greater than usual tyre loading. On June 18, Michelin reported that it did not understand why the tyres it had provided for its seven customer teams – BAR, McLaren, Red Bull, Renault, Sauber, Toyota, and Williams – had failed in this turn, and announced its intention to fly in tyres of a different specification from its Clermont-Ferrand headquarters. The replacement tyres flown in, which were of the type used in the Spanish Grand Prix earlier that year, turned out to have the same problem when tested.\n\nIn a letter to FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting dated Saturday, June 18, Michelin representatives Pierre Dupasquier and Nick Shorrock revealed that they did not know the cause of the Toyota tyre failures, and unless the cars could be slowed down in Turn 13, they could not guarantee the tyres' safety for more than 10 laps.\nWhiting replied on Sunday, June 19, expressing his surprise that Michelin had not brought suitable tyres, suggesting that the teams should limit their drivers to the maximum safe speed specified by Michelin in Turn 13. He also addressed several solutions which had been proposed by the teams, insisting that use of the new specification tyres flown in overnight would be \"a breach of the rules to be considered by the stewards\", and the placement of a chicane in the turn was \"out of the question\" – the race would not be sanctioned by the FIA (making it a non-championship race) if the track layout was changed. He deemed the Michelin teams' proposals to be \"grossly unfair\" to the Bridgestone teams.\n\nIn a second letter, also dated June 18, Dupasquier and Shorrock confirmed that they would not permit their teams to race on the Michelin tyres used during qualification without changes to the circuit, and reiterated their request to slow down Turn 13. Whiting's brief reply maintained that no such change would be permitted, and gave the teams the choice of limiting speeds through Turn 13, using tyres of a different specification to those used in qualifying, subject to a penalty, or changing tyres repeatedly, which would have been permitted if a driver's safety were at issue.\n\nPaul Stoddart, then owner of Minardi, a team using Bridgestone tyres, published an account on Wednesday, June 22, of the events leading up to the race. Stoddart recorded a meeting around 10:00am on the day of the race, to which Speedway president Tony George, two senior Michelin representatives, Bernie Ecclestone (president and CEO of Formula One Management and Formula One Administration), the team principals, and the teams' Michelin technical representatives were summoned. All invited were present except Jean Todt, Team Principal of Scuderia Ferrari. The Michelin representatives stated their position that the tyres provided to the teams could not safely complete the race distance, and requested that the Bridgestone teams, represented by Stoddart and Jordan's Colin Kolles, permit the installation of a chicane in Turn 13. Those present discussed and agreed to reject the FIA's solution of speed-limiting the Michelin cars in the turn because of the potential for accidents. They likewise dismissed the possibility of making pit stops every ten laps, resolved that a chicane was the best solution, and instructed several technical representatives to prepare plans for its installation. Bernie Ecclestone offered to consult Todt, who had not come to the meeting, and the president of the FIA, Max Mosley, who was not present at the race, and reconvene the meeting when he had responses.\n\nEcclestone returned at about 10:55 to inform the group that Todt had refused to agree to the chicane, maintaining that it was an FIA and a Michelin problem and not his. By the time Stoddart's account of the meeting was published, Todt had already denied that he had ever been consulted, but stated that, if asked, he would not have agreed to the chicane. Furthermore, Ecclestone reported that Mosley had \"stated that if any attempts were made to alter the circuit, he would cancel the Grand Prix forthwith\".\n\nThe group, according to Stoddart, continued to propose alternative solutions, including \"a non-championship race, or a race in which the Michelin teams could not score points, and even a race whereby only the Michelin teams used the new chicane\", but eventually agreed that the best option was to install the chicane and run a non-championship race, without Ferrari if necessary. To ignore the FIA's instructions and carry on the race would have resulted in the FIA's withdrawing its staff, so the group appointed delegates to fill the various offices, including a race director to replace Charlie Whiting and a safety car driver to replace Bernd Mayländer. The team principals were instructed to convey to their teams and drivers that, in the absence of FIA scrutineers and equipment, the technical rules could not be enforced, and that they were to conduct themselves honourably and in the interest of an entertaining race.\n\nThey proceeded to summon the twenty drivers and present their plan. Of the drivers' opinions, Stoddart writes: \"While I cannot testify that each and every driver agreed with what we were proposing, what I can say with certainty is that no driver disagreed.\" The Ferrari drivers expressed no opinion in the matter, leaving the decision to Todt, who was not present. The nine team principals who were present then resolved that, unless they and the FIA could come to a decision in the best interest of the sport, they would not participate in the race.\n\nAfter a short break, the group gathered again in Ecclestone's office to find Renault team principal Flavio Briatore on the phone with Max Mosley. Mosley had apparently rejected all of their proposals, and it was stated that \"Mosley had informed Mr. Martin, the FIA's most senior representative in the USA, that if any kind of non-championship race was run, or any alteration made to the circuit, the US Grand Prix, and indeed, all FIA-regulated motorsport in the US, would be under threat\". On the same day that Stoddart's version of events was published, the FIA issued a statement denying that Mosley had made the reported threat, or that any such conversation had taken place.\n\nHaving exhausted their options, the Michelin team principals, Stoddart, and Bernie Ecclestone – but not Jordan's Colin Kolles – discussed whether their cars should proceed to the grid, and decided that they should participate in the formation lap but that they could not race. Stoddart asked Kolles if he would be entering his cars and was informed that Jordan would indeed be racing, despite having previously agreed not to. Stoddart was then approached by a Bridgestone representative and told that Bridgestone wanted him to race; he has also stated that given his \"current relationship with Mr Mosley, [he] felt certain heavy sanctions would follow if [he] did not [race].\" Stoddart too decided to enter his drivers, but reported that he would retire them if the Jordans did not finish the race.\n\nAt the start of the race, all the cars lined up on the grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled the green light to start the formation lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.\n\nThe move by the teams, to come to the grid and then pull out after the formation lap into the pits, infuriated the fans, who did not know about the plan. BBC Radio broadcaster Maurice Hamilton said of the event, \"Without question, it was the strangest race I commentated on in F1.\" Because of the retirement of the drivers who qualified ahead of them, Michael Schumacher and his Ferrari teammate, Barrichello, were the foremost starters, though using the grid positions they had qualified in; the pair were followed by Tiago Monteiro and Narain Karthikeyan, both driving for Jordan. Rounding out the remaining field of six were Christijan Albers and Patrick Friesacher of Minardi. Schumacher retained the lead when the race started, and the only changes in positioning came when Albers overtook Karthikeyan but lost the position again later on in the race. The two Ferrari drivers quickly built a significant lead over their rivals. By lap 10, many of the estimated 100,000–130,000 attendees had begun to leave the grandstands. Thousands of fans were reported to have gone to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway ticket office to demand refunds, and police were called to keep the peace. Boos were heard throughout the race, and some upset fans threw beer cans and water bottles on the track.\n\nThe race was a story of pit strategy, as the only passing on the circuit was of lapped traffic. Albers was the only car to run a three pit stop race, as all other drivers chose to stop only twice. The only lead changes came on lap 26, as Schumacher's 32-second stop gave Barrichello the lead, and on lap 51, as Schumacher turned in the quickest pit stop at 23.615 seconds, giving him enough time to exit pit lane at the same time as Barrichello, with the result of forcing Barrichello into the grass of Turn One. After this incident, which was not investigated by race officials, both Ferrari drivers were reminded over their radios not to crash out of the race, and they both settled into a slower pace, comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. Schumacher ended up with the victory, ahead of Barrichello. Monteiro and Karthikeyan, more than a lap down, finished in a distant third and fourth, and Albers and Friesacher brought up the rear, two laps down. All four of the drivers for Jordan and Minardi scored their first points in Formula One at this race. Karthikeyan's points were the first for an Indian driver in Formula One. This was also the final race at which the Minardi team tallied points.\n\nAt the podium ceremony, at which none of the scheduled dignitaries were present, all Ferrari team members quietly accepted their awards, and quickly exited. Monteiro stayed behind to celebrate his first podium finish, and the first for a Portuguese driver.\n\nThe win, Schumacher's only victory of 2005, moved him from fifth to third in the drivers championship. Alonso and Räikkönen remained first and second in the championship standings, on 59 and 37 points respectively, while Schumacher moved up to 34 points. With his second-place finish, Barrichello went into fourth in the drivers championship, on 29 points, and Trulli dropped to fifth with 27 points. The Ferrari team moved into joint second in the Constructors' Championship, matching McLaren with 63 points; both teams trailed Renault, which retained the lead on 76 points. Both Jordan and Minardi scored points, moving out of a tie with BAR-Honda at the bottom of the constructor standings. The results of the United States Grand Prix were overshadowed by the withdrawal of the Michelin-shod teams, and by the inability to find a solution which would have allowed them to race.\n\nBernie Ecclestone, in answer to a question by ITV's Martin Brundle in an interview just before the start of the race, described the future of Formula One in the United States and the future of Michelin in the sport as \"not good\". He also said that the \"incident's not the fault of the teams, to be honest with you.\"\n\nThe race was labelled a farce, and David Coulthard said, \"It throws into doubt the future of the race in US\". Associated Press writer Stephen Wade pointed to the boycott as an extension of previous disagreements between the teams and Max Mosley, which had led to the threatened creation of a rival series as an alternative to Formula One. \"The Guardian\"'s Richard Williams considered the prior disputes a factor in the failure to reach a compromise and felt that the events at this race had increased the risk of a complete rupture.\n\nMinardi boss Paul Stoddart said immediately after the race that nine teams – all but Ferrari – agreed not to race, and had Jordan not reversed its decision at the last minute, Minardi would also have boycotted the race. In his later, lengthier, statement, he indicated that although it had been Michelin's failure to provide a reliable tyre which had initiated the events, he laid the full blame for the failure to reach some accommodation (which would have allowed a race to happen, for the benefit of the many fans who had paid considerable money for travel and tickets) at the feet of Max Mosley and the FIA, with a small share of the blame going to what he characterized as the obstructionist Ferrari team leader, Jean Todt. He furthermore called for Mosley's resignation.\n\nThe following day, the FIA published a justification of its refusal to permit a change in tyres or the installation of a chicane. It contended that Formula One operated under \"clear rules\" which could not be altered when a team \"brings the wrong equipment to a race.\" It further claimed that a chicane would have resulted in the race being run on a track that had been significantly altered \"without following any of the modern safety procedures,\" which would have exposed FIA to significant legal liability in the event of an accident.\n\nThe FIA also summoned the seven Michelin-shod teams before the World Motorsport Council at their headquarters in France, for a hearing on June 29, to explain their failure to participate, by which they had presumably violated the terms of the Concorde Agreement. It later published copies of the letters sent to each team \"in the interests of transparency\".\nThey were charged with violating article 151c of the International Sporting Code, which refers to \"acts prejudicial to the interests of competition or motorsport generally.\" Specifically, it was charged that they had:\n\nOn June 22 the FIA produced a press release from Max Mosley, in the form of a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.\n\nOn June 29 the FIA World Motorsport Council found the teams guilty of not being in possession of suitable tyres, \"but with strong mitigating circumstances,\" and failure to allow their cars to start the race. The teams were found not guilty of the other three counts. The punishment was not decided, and was not to have been announced until September 14.\n\nOn July 22, the FIA World Motorsport Council voted to overturn its previous decision, and exonerated the Michelin teams of all charges. The decision was due to \"evidence previously submitted to the FIA Senate.\" According to BBC Sport, Dennis and Red Bull principal Christian Horner told Mosley and the FIA Senate that Indiana state law left the Michelin teams no option but to pull out of the race. They contended that had they competed, they potentially faced criminal charges for knowingly putting others at risk even if no accident actually occurred.\n\nOn June 28, Michelin announced that it would offer compensation to all race fans who had purchased tickets for the Grand Prix. The company planned to issue refund cheques through the Speedway ticket office for the price of all tickets for the race by the end of September. Additionally, Michelin purchased 20,000 tickets for the 2006 United States Grand Prix to be distributed to spectators who attended the 2005 race.\n\nIn addition to the refunded tickets, there was some discussion about holding a second, non-championship race at Indianapolis. On July 2, at the 2005 French Grand Prix, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis suggested that an additional race could be held at the American circuit after the last official race of the season, in Shanghai. The teams had, apparently, already discussed the idea with Bernie Ecclestone. But the next day Tony George dismissed the possibility: \"There will be no race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway this fall.\"\n\nAt the 2005 Champ Car World Series Grand Prix of Cleveland, held one week after the US Grand Prix, free admission was granted to all bearers of ticket stubs of the US Grand Prix.\n\nTeams that were not in the top four of the 2004 Constructors' Championship standings were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race, with the exception of Ricardo Zonta, who replaced Ralf Schumacher after his practice accident.\n\n\n"}

She is the daughter of Prince Alexander \"Stash\" Valensky, a wealthy Russian-born polo player and former playboy, and his wife Francesca Vernon, a beautiful and talented American actress. Stash and Francesca, madly in love, are thrilled by her pregnancy and the news that she is carrying twins. However, a problem during delivery denies one of the twin girls, named Danielle, enough oxygen, and she is born brain-damaged, while Daisy is healthy. Francesca suffers from acute post-partum depression and enters a fugue state for several weeks. Stash, who has a fear and disgust of illness and abnormality after a childhood spent watching his mother slowly waste away from tuberculosis, is unable to accept or love Danielle. When Francesca recovers from her depression, he lies to her, telling her that the second-born twin died soon after birth. She discovers the truth and flees with both infants to California, where she is helped by her former agent and his wife. For several years, she lives a secluded life in Carmel and grants Stash short visits with Daisy.\n\nFrancesca dies in a car accident, and Daisy and Dani are reunited with their father, who immediately places Dani in an expensive but remote home for retarded children, much to Daisy's distress. When Daisy turns 16, her father dies in a plane accident, after which her older half-brother, Ram, who has become obsessed with her, seduces and then brutally rapes her. To get her away from Ram, her father's mistress, Anabel (a mother figure to the girl), sends her to the University of California at Santa Cruz, where she forms what will be a lifelong friendship with Kiki Kavanaugh, an auto industry heiress from Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Because of Daisy's total estrangement from Ram, who is a trustee of her inheritance, she neglects to read his letters regarding her stock portfolio at a crucial moment and thus loses everything her father left her. As a result, she is forced to drop out of college and go to work. She paints portraits of rich, horse-mad peoples' children on ponies in order to pay Dani's bills and also works in a demanding job at a production company that makes television commercials.\n\nWhen Anabel becomes ill and needs money for treatment, Daisy must make a decision to abandon her private life. Up to this point, Daisy has lived out of the public eye, refusing to trade on her title for financial gain, but she ultimately accepts an opportunity to do so. In the process, Daisy must learn to trust a man who loves her, to come to terms with her sister's disability, and to make peace with the life she's been given.\n\nThe book hit number one a week before publication on The New York Times Best Seller List.

It is located in Nyandarua County, west central Kenya, northeast of Naivasha and Gilgil and just south of the Equator. The mountain range is called Nyandarua among the Agikuyu people in whose territory this forest and mountain range is located. The name Nyandarua means a drying hide due to the distinctive fold of its silhouette.\n\nThe Aberdare Range forms a section of the eastern rim of the Great Rift Valley running roughly north to south.\nOn the west, the range falls off steeply into the Kinangop Plateau and then into the Great Rift Valley. On the east, the range slopes more gently. Lake Naivasha and the distant Mau Escarpment can be seen from peaks in the range.\n\nThe range has a maximum elevation of above sea level and is heavily forested. \nThe former name of the range survives in Mount Satima (\"the mountain of the young bull\"), the highest peak in the Aberdare Range.\nThe second-highest peak, at the southern end of the range, is Mount Kinangop at . \nMount Kenya, the second highest mountain in Africa after Kilimanjaro lies east of the Aberdare Range.\n\nThe Aberdares are the water catchment area for the Sasumua dam and the Ndakaini dam, which provide most of the water for Nairobi. The mountain forests are catchment areas for the Tana River, the largest river in Kenya, supplying water to the Seven Forks hydroelectric power complex which generates over 55 percent of Kenya's total electricity output.\n\nThe main ecosystems within the mountain range are rainforest giving way to dense bamboo forests and then moorland.\nThe steep western edges of the hillside are sparsely inhabited by wildlife compared to the forested gentle slopes to the east, which are home to a wide variety of wildlife. There are multitudes of elephant, buffalo, giant forest hog as well as the endangered black rhino. A variety of cats including leopards and the rare African golden cat. Other threatened species including the Jackson mongoose, the black and white colobus monkey and Sykes' monkey are plentiful, as are waterbuck, reedbuck, duikers, serval cats and bushbuck.\n\nThe Aberdares contain a rich diversity of vegetation. There are 778 vegetation and plant species, subspecies and varieties found in the Aberdare National Park, due to the park's altitude and rainfall. Hardwood trees include camphor, cedar, podo and hagenia.\n\nMuch of the range has been protected within the Aberdare National Park since its creation in 1950. The range attracts large numbers of hikers and climbers operating out of the main centers of Naivasha and Gilgil. The lower slopes are farmed, higher areas are known for their wildlife. The Rhino Charge is an annual event run by conservationists in Kenya to pay for fencing of the Aberdare National Park as a means of protecting East Africa's largest indigenous forest from destruction.\n\nAberdare Ranges Forest are the host for the Aberdare Forest Reserve, which along with the Kikuyu Escapements run 120 km (75 miles) northwards from Nairobi and about 40 km (25 miles) at its widest point. With a perimeter of 566 km (352 miles), the Aberdare Ranges vary in altitude from 2000 meters (7000') on the forest boundary on the eastside and 4,001 meters (13,130') towards the northern edge at the peak of Oldonyo Lesatima. The Ranges descend gradually from the peak towards Nyahururu from the northern side, where incised river valleys and volcanic vents are evident. On the southern side, the ranges are steep southwards from IL Kinangop peak towards the northern part of Murang’a North District.\n\nThe major rivers from Aberdare Forest are Athi and Tana, which flow into the India Ocean, Ewaso Nyiro that drains into the Lorian Swamp and River Malewa that drains into Lake Naivasha. The ranges also have several tributaries, and higher up are bog markings that are the source of the rivers on the moorlands and afro-alpine. The Athi, Lake Naivasha, Tana and Ewaso Nyiro river basins have their source in Aberdare Forest Reserve.\n\nEndemic plants on the forest include Lobelia deckeniisspsattimae, Helichrysum gloria-dei and \"Alchemilla hageniae\". The forest has four vegetation zones including subalpine vegetation, xeromorphic evergreen forest, montane humid forest, and submontane forest.\n\nFound at altitudes above 3,300 metres (11,000') is the moorlands. Alpine grass (\"Deschampsia\"), distinguished by giant groundsell (\"Dendrosenecio johnstonii\"), \"Lobelia deckenii\", and heath (\"Erica excelsa\"). Moorland communities are the main vegetation in this region. Shrub communities consisting of \"Erica arborea\" and \"Hebenstretia angolensis\" are found between 3,000 metres and 3,300 metres (10,000' and 11,000'), while a belt of bamboo is common between 2,400 and 3,300 m (7900 and 11,000'), and cover about 35,000 ha (135 square miles).\n\nThis belt is mostly dominated by pioneer species \"Macaranga capensis\" and \"Newbutonia macrocalyx\" and runs to the east side of the range. The region is also host to the valuable commercial species including \"Aningeria adolfi-friederici\", \"Ocotea usambarensis\" and \"Syzygium guineense\", which are the most conspicuous forest in the Kikuyu escarpment.\n\nLocated on the dry northern and western slopes of Aberdares, it has several species with the most notable being the olives (\"Olea europaea\", \"Olea capensis\", \"Olea hochstetteri\"), podo (\"Podocarpus latifolius\"), and cedar (\"Juniperus procera\").\n\nThis forms the seasonal forest cover on the north-east slopes with predominantly \"Ekebergia capensis\", \"Nuxia congesta\", \"Cassipourea malossana\" and \"Calodendrum capense\" (Cape chestnut) species.\n\nThe Aberdare Range was named by Joseph Thomson in 1884 in honour of Lord Aberdare, who at the time was President of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Historical Society. Aberdare was also a Liberal politician who had served as Home Secretary from 1868 to 1873. He was later to become the first Chancellor of the University of Wales.\n\nThe area is well known as the headquarters of Dedan Kimathi, leader of the 1950s Mau Mau Uprising. Elizabeth II became Queen of the United Kingdom while vacationing in the Aberdares. \nIt was also the site where J.A. Hunter killed the rogue elephant of Aberdare Forest.\n\n"}

It started from the Pons Aemilius, and the first part of its course is identical with that of the Via Campana. The Porta Portuensis of the Aurelian Walls had a double arch, probably owing to the amount of traffic it had to carry, but the divergence occurred a good deal further on, probably a mile from the gate. The Via Portuensis went to the right into hilly country, while the Via Campana kept to the valley of the Tiber. The roads rejoined at the modern Ponte Galeria.\n\nWith the growth of importance of the Via Portuensis from the time of Constantine onwards, that of the Via Ostiensis correspondingly decreased. Procopius, who describes how barges were dragged up the river by teams of oxen moving along it, must be describing the towpath, and not either the Via Portuensis or even the Via Campana, which is in many places at quite a considerable distance from the winding course of the river.\n\nIts large amounts of traffic caused the road to be eventually reconstructed with two parallel roads: one for traffic going one way and the other for traffic going the other. It is considered to have been the world's first dual carriageway.\n\nToday Rome's Via Portuense follows a similar path. The road starts today from the Porta Portese and, after Ponte Galeria, ends in the \"comune\" of Fiumicino.\n"}

Ward celebrated both of her heritages in her poetry and writing. She was a regular contributor to the \"Colored American\" magazine and wrote a column for the New Rochelle, New York publication, the \"Westchester Record-Courier\".\n\nBorn May 23, 1869, in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York, Ward was the third of three daughters of Eliza Draper and Abraham Ward, both of whom were of mixed African-American and Montaukett descent. Ward's mother died when she was about nine months old, and her father moved with the family to Providence, Rhode Island. When her father remarried there, he gave young Olivia to her mother's sister Maria Draper for care, who reared Olivia as her own. She attended local schools in Providence, and studied nursing in high school. She also became interested in drama and poetry.\n\nIn 1889, Ward married Frank Bush. The couple had two daughters, Rosamund and Maria. After Ward and Bush divorced around 1895, Ward supported her daughters and her then-aged Aunt Maria.\n\nWard married again in 1916 to Anthony Banks, a Pullman porter. Her first daughter Rosamund married and died young, in 1929.\n\nWard found work at times in either Providence and Boston, whatever she could find to support her family. Despite long days working, she wrote and published her first book of poetry, a slim volume called \"Original Poems\" in 1899. She received excellent reviews from the respected Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet. By 1900 she was working as an assistant theater director at the Robert Gould Shaw Settlement House in Boston, where she continued until about 1914.\n\nWard returned to Long Island with her daughters, where her interest in the arts continued to grow. Her mother and aunt had been raised in the Montaukett culture, which was important to Ward. Living at the easterly end of the South Fork, she served as the Montaukett tribal historian, a position she held until about 1916. She published her second, more substantial, volume of poetry, \"Driftwood\" in 1914. This was her most popular volume.\n\nBy 1918 or so, Ward had moved to Chicago, Illinois, with her second husband Anthony Banks, whose job with the Pullman Company was based there. She wrote her first play, \"Indian Trails: or Trail of the Montauk\"; as it survives only in fragments, scholars estimate a date of 1920. After that, she turned more of her writing to the African-American experience. Chicago was becoming an important urban center of black life, music and culture during the Great Migration, as tens of thousands of blacks left the rural South and moved to northern industrial cities.\n\nWard became a regular contributor to \"Colored America\" magazine and a strong supporter of the \"New Negro Movement.\" She helped sculptor Richmond Barthé and author/poet Langston Hughes get their starts during the Harlem Renaissance. Ward expressed her passion about the struggles of African Americans and the need for social change through her writing. She also demonstrated her faith in God through her words.\n\nThe Banks established and ran the Bush-Banks School of Expression in Chicago, which became a place for black artists to gather and nurture their art. Actors and musicians gave recitals and performances at the school. Ward continued her artistic endeavors, focusing on drama. She also worked teaching drama in the Chicago public school system. From the late 1920s on, she traveled between Chicago and New York, where her surviving daughter Marie lived with her family.\n\nIn the 1930s, Ward returned east to live in New Rochelle, New York and New York City. In 1936 she was part of the Works Progress Administration's Theatre Project during the Great Depression. She counted civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois; poet and novelist Countee Cullen; and actor/singer Paul Robeson among her friends.\n\nIn the 1930s she wrote an arts column and acted as arts editor for the \"Westchester Record-Courier\". She also served with the Works Progress Administration as a drama coach at the Abyssinian Baptist Church's Community Center, from 1936–1939. Abyssinian served as an important location for secular as well as religious music and art during the Harlem Renaissance and later.\n\nWard wrote several plays and short stories, most of which were never published, some because she expressed issues of interracial culture.\n\nWard's work is notable for preserving regional and ethnic dialects that would otherwise have no written record. She also wrote of the Native American experience in her work, preserving some of the Algonquian Montauk language and folklore, especially during the early part of her career. Later, after moving to Chicago, she wrote more about the African-American experience, and reflected its values (political, cultural, religious.)\n\nOlivia Ward Bush Banks died in 1944. She had been close to her second daughter Marie and her granddaughter Helen, who lived in New York.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2074758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074758", "title": "Underspecification", "text": "Underspecification\n\nIn theoretical linguistics, underspecification is a phenomenon in which certain features are omitted in underlying representations. Restricted underspecification theory holds that features should only be underspecified if their values are predictable. For example, in most dialects of English, all front vowels () are unrounded. It is not necessary for these phonemes to include the distinctive feature [−round], because all [−back] vowels are [−round] vowels, so the roundness feature is not distinctive for front vowels. Radical underspecification theory, on the other hand, also allows for traditionally binary features to be specified for only one value, where it is assumed that every segment not specified for that value has the other value. For example, instead of the features [+voice] and [−voice], only [+voice] is specified and voicelessness is taken as the default.\n\nThe concept of underspecification is also used in morphological theory, particularly to refer to cases in which a morpheme does not bear an entire set of feature-values, and is thus compatible with a wide range of potential morphological environments. In this approach to morphology, for example, while the English pronouns \"he\" vs. \"she\" are specified for gender, the plural pronoun \"they\" would be underspecified for gender.\n\nIn Tuvan, phonemic vowels are specified with the articulatory features of tongue height, backness, and lip rounding. The archiphoneme |U| is an underspecified high vowel where only the tongue height is specified.\n\nWhether |U| is pronounced as front or back and whether rounded or unrounded depends on vowel harmony. If |U| occurs following a front unrounded vowel, it will be pronounced as the phoneme ; if following a back unrounded vowel, it will be as an ; and if following a back rounded vowel, it will be an . This can be seen in the following words:\n\nUnderspecification in morphology uses feature decomposition to create abstract, binary features that allow for the creation of natural classes in relation to morphology.\n\nIn German, there are three classes of gender. These are feminine, masculine, and neuter. \nFrom this breakdown of German gender features, underspecification theory derives the following definitions of gender using a cross classification of the gender features [±masc] and [±fem].\n\nIn the underspecification theory, the dative singular marker -em is characterized by an underspecified gender marking ([-fem]). This would allow for a single morphological exponent to be referred to by one set of underspecified features. Take for example, the determiner dem, which can occur in masculine and neuter contexts in the dative singular. By allowing the underspecification of the feminine feature, dem is free to appear in both the masculine and neuter contexts, but not the feminine context. This contrasts the traditional view, in which there are two separate but homophonous forms of dem, in which dem1 contains the full gender specification [-fem, +masc] and dem2 contains the full gender specification [-fem, - masc].\n\n"}

It is home to 1,525 residents, two churches, a primary school, a Post Office, a pub, a village hall and several local businesses.\n\nGuilden Sutton was mentioned in the Domesday Book. Legend has it that the parish has always been \"off the beaten track\", with Roman Roads running close by. Indeed, there is a delightful story that Cromwell's men were unable to find it when they sought to punish the Royalist settlement, and that missing Chester plate is buried under an unspecified oak tree.\nActual historic finds have been few: a bronze coin of Licinius I (AD 307–324) found behind the Bird in Hand, a mediaeval lead spindlewhorl, four 17th-century swords found in a house cellar, and a cannonball.\n\nA church was probably built in the 12th or 13th century. The earliest register of births, marriages and deaths dates back to 1595; the Achdeacon's corrections Books, recording the proceedings of church courts, refer to “Edward Dutton and Margaret his wife” being absent from church in 1673 and the churchwardens' accounts reveal that 10s 6d (52.5p) purchased a coffin for Joseph Joynson in 1744.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, the parish consisted of 12 farm houses and eight cottages. Always an agricultural community, the parish had the services of a man to prevent cattle straying. The church was much damaged by a great storm in 1802 and was rebuilt. By 1810, the village was growing and had 24 houses and 120 people, increasing to 42 houses and 234 people 60 years later, including farmers, a blacksmith, a tile and brick maker, two boot and shoe makers, a painter and a bricklayer.\n\nThe Methodist Chapel was built in 1873, the original village school in 1891, and the present church hall in 1916.\n\nBy the 1930s, the village had grown to 404 people with electricity having arrived in 1925. Piped water did not extend to the main part of the village until 1945, and gas not until 1968. In 1951, part of a neighbouring area was transferred to Guilden Sutton, adding a further 209 inhabitants. Further new housing was added on a modest scale during the next 15 years, but plans were then drawn up for a large scale expansion which, now completed, has taken the village to its present size.\n\nGuilden Sutton has an eight-member elected parish council. Elections were contested for the first time in recent history in May 2011 and most recently in May 2019.\n\nNone of the Parish Councillors in Guilden Sutton is affiliated with a political party. The Clerk to the Council is Lisa Tiplady.\n\nThe new unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester Council replaced Chester City Council and Cheshire County Council on 1 April 2009. Shadow elections to the new unitary authority were held on 1 May 2008, in which Guilden Sutton was part of the Gowy Ward (based on the old Cheshire County Council division of the same name). In May 2011, the ward was renamed 'Chester Villages' and representation was reduced to two councillors. The election was won by Margaret and Stuart Parker for the Conservative Party. \nIn May 2015 the Parish of Guilden Sutton was enlarged to include that portion of Pipers Ash to the east of the A41 largely bordering Hare Lane and extending to the A51 at Chester Rugby Club.\nIn June 2018 the Boundaries were changed following recommendations from the Local Government Boundary Commission for England.

{"id": "2074764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074764", "title": "Atlantic and Gulf Railroad (1856–1879)", "text": "Atlantic and Gulf Railroad (1856–1879)\n\nThe Atlantic and Gulf Railroad was chartered in February 1856 by act of the Georgia General Assembly. It was also known as the Main Trunk Railroad. It traversed south Georgia from Screven to Bainbridge, Georgia. Construction began in early January 1859. Its construction was halted by the American Civil War. Construction began again after the end of the war and the line was completed to Bainbridge, Georgia by late December 1867. The route never reached all the way to the Gulf of Mexico as it had originally had intended. The company went bankrupt in 1877 and was bought in 1879 by Henry B. Plant and became incorporated into his Plant System. Its main line is currently operated by CSX Transportation. Throughout its history, the Atlantic and Gulf was closely associated with the Savannah and Albany Railroad Company and its successor the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad.\n\nIn the 1830s, a railroad route through south Georgia to the Atlantic coast was the goal of several different competing companies. The route was desired due to the growth of cotton production in the area and the lack of navigable rivers through the area. The head of navigation on the Flint River was at Albany, Georgia, the center of cotton trade in the region; however, the Flint River was relatively small and Apalachicola Bay lacked a decent harbor. There were two major ports on Georgia's Atlantic coast at the time: Brunswick and Savannah.\n\nThe Brunswick and Florida Railroad Company received its charter from the Georgia General Assembly on December 22, 1835. Their charter allowed them to select a route between Brunswick, Georgia and Florida, and forbade another route from existing with of their own. On that same day, the Great Western Railroad Company received their charter. Theirs allowed for a route from Macon to the start of the Altamaha River on either side of the Ocmulgee River with the option of extending the line to Brunswick and to the Flint River. The latter soon faded into obscurity. By 1836, the Brunswick and Florida Railroad Company was advertising their desire for a route from Brunswick to Apalachicola. The Brunswick and Florida faced major setbacks due to funding problems.\n\nOn December 25, 1847, the Savannah and Albany Railroad Company was chartered by the Georgia General Assembly to construct a rail line from a point along the Central of Georgia Railway near Savannah to Albany with the possibility of extending the railroad to the Chattahoochee River at any time. The bill was introduced by Nelson Tift. By 1853, some in the company were discussing a branch line to Florida. In February 1854, the stock company rebranded themselves the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad through a new charter from the state, but had also completed very little of the planned route. They also lacked the legal right to a more southern route that the Brunswick and Florida Railroad had by its charters.\n\nBy April 1854, citizens in south Georgia were hoping that the two companies would avoid competition with one another and construct a \"main trunk\" line together. In November 1855, a bill was introduced to the Georgia General Assembly by Alexander Lawton to give the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf's southern branch line the right to cross the line of the Brunswick and Florida, but it did not pass.\n\nIn early 1856, a compromise was reached between the two competing companies was passed by the Georgia General Assembly. They would both build to a certain point in south Georgia, and then a main trunk line was to be built. The company chartered to build that line was incorporated as the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad Company in February 1856. Construction of the Atlantic and Gulf was forbidden until the junction of the Brunswick and Florida Railroad and the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad. After that junction had been made the line was to state from the intersection of the county lines of Appling, Ware, and Wayne. The borders of those counties have changed substantially since the passage of the act creating the railroad. The act authorized the company to extend the route to the western state line at any point between Fort Gaines, Georgia and the confluence of the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers with the route chosen to allow for speedy access to the Gulf of Mexico through either Pensacola, Florida or Mobile, Alabama. At that time the Brunswick and Florida had only completed the first of its line. On March 31, 1856, the board of commissioners for the Atlantic and Gulf met in Milledgeville to plan for the opening of books and the subscription of stocks. By October 22, 1856, the commissioners showed a total of $600,000 in stock raised. On October, the state of Georgia subscribed to a total of $500,000. James P. Screven was named as the president of the company in December 1856. He was also the president of the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad.\n\nMembers of the Brunswick and Florida Railroad Company also met in December 1856 to discuss the changes to the charter made by the Georgia legislature. They recommended that their company refuse to junction with or surrender charter privileges to the Atlantic and Gulf Company unless it was beneficial to the development of the city of Brunswick. They also wanted the junction, if it was to take place, to be located east of the Satilla River. The Brunswick and Florida Railroad Company was still busy in April 1857 trying to get the citizen of Lowndes and Berrien counties on their side and claimed that $40,000 in stock had been raised in Lowndes County alone. At that same time, the Savannah Albany, and Gulf Railroad had finished grading the section of their line between the Altamaha River and the Little Satilla River. That section is between modern Doctortown and Screven in Wayne County, Georgia. Portions of the Brunswick and Florida Railroad Company were being openly critical of the route of the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad until its construction was well underway in late 1859. Another line, the Brunswick and Pensacola Railroad was a second projected route that was to link the junction of the Brunswick and Florida Railroad and the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad at what is now Glenmore, Georgia to the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad at Thomasville, Georgia. That line was never constructed. The Brunswick faction began focusing on the branch line they had planned to Albany, which would evolve into Brunswick and Albany Railroad by 1861.\n\nThe Wiregrass Region that the route of the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad was to pass through was sparsely populated. It dominated by large stands of longleaf pines and wetlands, and crossed by several rivers. Most of the work was done by enslaved blacks.\n\nThree different routes through Lowndes County were surveyed by E.L. Heriot, Chief Engineer for the company: a route through northern Troupville a line through northern Lowndes County, and a line passing through Lowndes County and crossing the Withlacoochee River at Mineral Springs. On June 17, 1858, the company announced it had chosen the southern-most route of the three. In July 1858, a meeting of citizens from Berrien and Lowndes counties expressed their disapproval with the route chosen. They commented that the route chosen was too close to the Florida state line to be beneficial to the citizen of south Georgia and that because of it, the Atlantic and Gulf was in violation of its charter.\n\nConstruction of the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad began on January 2, 1859, at the Little Satilla River near modern Screven, Georgia. Construction averaged a week. In July 1859, James P. Screven died and was replaced by his son John Screven as president of Atlantic and Gulf. In late 1860, Atlantic and Gulf failed to pay contractors McDowell and Callahan due to state securities stagnating and private investors failing to pay their installments. The contracting firm Callahan & Co. had been hired to construct the of bridging and grading west of Thomasville.\n\nThe American Civil War disrupted the construction of the Atlantic and Gulf. By April 1861, the railroad had just reached Thomasville. The original completion date to Bainbridge was supposed to be October 15, 1861.\n\nThe line from the initial point in Wayne County to Savannah continued to operate as the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad until the Georgia General Assembly consolidated that line under Atlantic and Gulf effective on May 1, 1863. The Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad had previously operated under its own name between Savannah and Thomasville. At the start of 1864, workers had graded the main line route to a point within about from Bainbridge. of the portion west of Thomasville already had crossties on the grade.\n\nIn April 1861, the Atlantic and Gulf and Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad began building a branch line between Lawton, Georgia and Live Oak, Florida, on the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad to enable the movement of troops and supplies between Georgia and Florida. Grading of the route was completed by May 1863. This link was not completed until March 1865, a month before the end of hostilities. It was the first railroad connecting the states of Florida and Georgia. After the war, it was operated by the Atlantic and Gulf as the Florida Division.\n\nOriginally the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad Company had two junctions with the Brunswick and Florida Railroad. The first was with the Brunswick and Florida's branch line from what is now Schlatterville to what is now Waycross, Georgia. The Brunswick and Florida's main line's primary junction with the Atlantic and Gulf was at Glenmore, but during the Civil War of the branch line which had extended all the way to Waresboro, Georgia was taken up by the Confederate government of Georgia to be used in more militarily important regions. After the Civil War, Brunswick and Florida Railroad's line was taken over by the Brunswick and Albany Railroad in 1869. The Schlatterville to Glenmore route was abandoned because of the growth of Waycross.\n\nThe Atlantic and Gulf line remained opened throughout most of the civil war. It remaining opening allowed many from central Georgia and coastal Georgia to take refuge in towns like Thomasville and Valdosta in south Georgia during the Atlanta Campaign and Sherman's March to the Sea from Summer to Autumn 1864. On December 19, 1864, the Battle of Altamaha Bridge took place at Atlantic and Gulf's trestle over the Altamaha River near Doctortown. The Confederate victory temporarily kept the only train route from coastal Georgia to south Georgia open. \n\nThe railroad sustained some damage the during Civil War compared to other railroads in Georgia. An estimated of the Atlantic and Gulf's rails were irreparably destroyed, with a total of damaged from Georgetown, Chatham County, Georgia to Morgan Lake near the Altamaha River. The trestles across the Ogeechee and the Little Ogeechee rivers were destroyed, but the long trestle across the Altamaha River was undamaged and ready to use by June 1865, when control of the Atlantic and Gulf was restored to its board of directors by General Henry Warner Birge.\n\nBy November 1865, the grading of the route to Bainbridge had been completed and the rails were set to be purchased when company finances allowed. By late December 1867, the Atlantic and Gulf's line had been completed to Bainbridge, Georgia.\n\nIn 1869, the Atlantic and Gulf purchased the line under construction by the South Georgia and Florida Railroad. It had been chartered by the Georgia General Assembly on December 22, 1857 to construct a railroad between Albany, Georgia and Thomasville, Georgia and from there to the most advantageous point on the Florida line. Only the portion of the line from Pelham, Georgia to Thomasville had been completed by the time of the purchase. The line was completed all the way to Albany within a year. The line was operated by the Atlantic and Gulf as their Albany Division.\n\nIn 1871, the Atlantic and Gulf constructed a two-mile extension of its line to the Savannah River.\n\nBy January 1872, the Atlantic and Gulf was still trying to expand beyond Bainbridge to the Gulf of Mexico and was still reporting increasing profits. By August, it asked for financial aid from the state of Georgia to help with the completion of the railroad to Pollard, Alabama, but the bill failed to become law in that session or the next. In March 1874, the state of Georgia sold 75% of its shares of stock in Atlantic and Gulf.\n\nOn January 1, 1877, Atlantic and Gulf declared bankruptcy after defaulting on several bonds. It had been hard hit by the Long Depression. In November 1879, it was bought by Henry B. Plant at a foreclosure sale and reorganized in December as the Savannah, Florida, and Western Railway, which developed into his Plant System.\n\nThe construction of the railroad had a profound effect upon the geography of south Georgia. The coming of railroad helped establish a number of new counties and moved several county seats. In general, the Atlantic and Gulf opened up south Georgia to settlement and population growth while also connecting it to areas from which it had previously been isolated. For decades after the railroad's establishment, new towns grew up along its route.\n\n\n\nEven though the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad and the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad were nominally separate entities before they merged in 1863, the Atlantic and Gulf continued with the station numbering system of the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad.

All the inhabitants of the community and the neighboring coconut palm ranches (Pátzcuaro, La Higuera, Los Caomiles, Pantoqui, San Francisco, Lo de Marcos, etc.) worked at the Jaltemba farm, owned by Ximena Plascencia Rojas, where coconut oil was extracted of spice oil Attalea Cohune. Coconut palm trees proliferated in this region of southern Nayarit; All the men worked to collect these, which were split in half with a stone to extract the oil from the nut. At the time of the coconut oil boom, many people died of lung diseases, caused by the inhalation of the dust that the coconut gave off when split.\n\nEvery week he arrived at the small port of Sayulita \"El Salvatierra\", where the oil production of the farm was shipped. The first owner was Don Marcial Nuño, but the Cristeros expelled him from the region and he was forced to sell the property, in 1927, to the Camarena family.\n\nThe farm grew, and in addition to the production of oil, it soon became an important livestock emporium initiated by Mrs. Camarena's son, Don Santiago. In 1936, Don Santiago gathered all the workers on the beach and said, \"Now I give the lands to you, so that, you can continue working them and in this way prevent this prosperous region from collapsing.”\n\nBy that time the Camarena had sold all their cattle and the government expropriated the farm land. Then Sayulita's ejido was born.\n\nIn the forties, coconut production declined considerably and the locals resorted to agriculture and fishing, which to this day is varied although less abundant. It is fished, among others: red snapper, snapper, horse mackerel, sierra, grouper, oyster, shrimp and lobster.\n\nIn 1965 the Varas-Vallarta highway was built and with it another important activity in the region was inaugurated: tourism. A few years later a government expansion and tourism development project began; in Sayulita the streets were paved, the kiosk, the square, the market, the sidewalks, etc. were built.\n\nOn the other side of the story, the locals say that Sayulita was formed more than 5000 years ago by the gods of the waves, who specifically created Sayulita to be a place where the waves were perfect. One of the gods that according to legend I think Sayulita was the god of waves Oz.\n\nSayulita has a population of approximately 2300 inhabitants.\n\nSayulita tourism is very good during the summer season, visited mainly by surfers since it is a very good place to surf. Other tourists are attracted to the mysterious cultures and popular fashions of Sayulita. Every year thousands of tourists visit the town on the way to Banderas Bay.\n\nAmong the fauna of this place when taking a walk through the jungle we can find a variety of very common fauna of this region that we can rarely observe them, very occasionally we find these animals that can be: badgers, armadillos, beavers, pumas, jaguars , ocelots, wild axolotls, rattlesnakes, iguanas, eagle fish, flatfish, wild whales, chacha-lacquers, wild boars and even occasionally some deer in the mountain region.\n\nAmong the fishing that stands out in this town are some fish such as dorado, tuna, sierra, mahi mahi, wahoo, marlin, guachinango, snapper, juriel, sierra fish, grouper or cherna, shrimp, lobster and oyster, sailfish, fish rooster, beautiful among other species. \n\nThe nightlife in Sayulita is very active. Multiple parties and nightclubs are held every weekend. It is a tradition \"Cocos Fridays\" every Friday after midnight the party is held at the \"Cocos\" beach club with music for dancing.\n\nTo get to Sayulita, take the federal highway 200 Tepic-Vallarta and at approximately \"km 125\" is the turnoff that takes you to the town of Sayulita on a paved road. Located 38 km from the international airport of Puerto Vallarta, you can reach Sayulita by public or private transport. To arrive by public transport from the airport it is necessary to head north on the Mexico 200 road and take the bus that you have on the windshield \"Sayulita\" or \"Compostela\". -to-sayulita /\n"}

The one exception to this is the island of Motu One in the extreme north of the group, which is a small atoll, and the only low island in the Marquesas.\n\nAside from Motu One, coral growths are found in several protected bays, especially on the northern and western sides of several of the islands, especially on Nuku Hiva.\n\nSharks are common in the offshore waters.\n\nNineteen species of seabirds breed in the Marquesas, and a number of other species visit the islands, including:\n\nThis should be considered in two separate groups – endemic species and introduced species – as follows:\n\nThe endemic fauna of the Marquesas has been extensively affected by human activity as well as by the introduction of domestic and pest species. Owing to their remoteness from continental landmasses (while they are not the most isolated islands in the world, they are the most distant from any continent), the Marquesas exhibit a paucity of endemic terrestrial species. This is limited to birds, arthropods (including 16 species of fruit fly, moths, butterflies, arachnids, etc.).\nAmong the 11 resident terrestrial bird species, the endemics are:\n\nThe negative impact of introduced species on the endemic avifauna is seen through the extinction of the red-moustached fruit dove (\"Ptilinopus mercierii\"), as well as in the drastic decline of such species as \"D. galeata\", of which only a few hundred specimens remain on Nuku Hiva, and several dozen specimens reintroduced to Ua Huka. Once common throughout the archipelago, the ultramarine lory is now found only on Ua Huka, and as a result of a reintroduction effort, is again found on Fatu Hiva. Various other species which are either threatened or endangered endemic are the Marquesas ground-dove, Marquesas kingfisher, Fatu Hiva monarch (\"Pomarea whitneyi\"), Iphis monarch (\"Pomarea iphis\", found only on Ua Huka), and Marquesas monarch (\"Pomarea mendozae\").\n\nAmong the endemic insects, the adaptive radiation of the gelechioid moth genus \"Asymphorodes\" is remarkable, with most of its 80 or so species known only from the Marquesas. Other Marquesan endemic moths include the strange \"Clarkeophlebia argentea\", the enigmatic \"Marasmianympha eupselias\", and \"Tessema sensilis\" which is apparently quite common but almost completely unstudied. Another unique endemic insect is the islands' sole praying mantis species, \"Tropidomantis kawaharai\", which is a member of a genus found largely in Asia, about tens of thousands of miles away.\n\nThe early seafaring Polynesians brought dogs, junglefowl, and pigs with them to the islands, and, as stowaways, the now-widespread Polynesian rat and several species of geckos, skinks and snails.\n\nLater, Europeans introduced other species. In 1842, Admiral Dupetit-Thouars brought horses to the island from Chile. Other Europeans brought goats, sheep, and cattle, and, as stowaways, several insect species, (including mosquitos, and no-no sandflies on Fatu Hiva), and scorpions. The common myna and great horned owl have been intentionally introduced onto Hiva Oa. The black rat (\"Rattus rattus\") has been introduced to all the islands except Fatu Hiva; in some cases this has had a drastic negative impact on populations of native bird species.\n\n"}
{"id": "2074822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074822", "title": "WBOS", "text": "WBOS\n\nWBOS (92.9 MHz, \"Rock 92.9\") is a commercial classic rock radio station licensed to Brookline, Massachusetts and serving Greater Boston. WBOS is owned and operated by Beasley Broadcast Group. Its studios are in Dorchester and its transmitter is on the top of the Prudential Tower in Boston's Back Bay.\n\nWBOS-FM signed-on in February 1960, simulcasting most of the programming of its sister station 1600 WBOS (now WUNR). Most of the AM station's programming was beautiful music, but when the AM side began to broadcast ethnic programming, the FM side continued to broadcast beautiful music, which was branded on both AM and FM as \"Boston's Music Theatre\". In 1975, WBOS-FM changed to a hodgepodge format which did not gain much of an audience.\n\nIn 1978, Boston radio personality Ron Robin, disappointed that the airtime for his weekly disco music show on WVBF had been cut back, left WVBF and began doing a four-hour Sunday-night disco show for WBOS. Initially, Robin bought the airtime and sold commercials for the show.\n\nThe success of that show led to WBOS hiring Robin, and a rapid expansion of the disco programming, first to seven nights a week from 8:00 p.m. to midnight (April 1978), and then to 24/7 in September 1978. For a brief time in late 1978 and early 1979, WBOS was one of Boston's most popular radio stations. But when WXKS-FM came on the scene with a highly promoted disco format, including big promotions and hiring away some WBOS jocks, WBOS' ratings suffered.\n\nWRKO midday legend J.J. Wright (most recently at WODS) was one of the original disco DJs for WBOS when the station went round-the-clock disco in 1978. Longtime, sought-after producer Jack King (WBIM-FM, WVBF, and WBZ) created, wrote and engineered most of the station's disco specials at the time. King was there at the beginning of the station's format change to disco and worked closely with Robin to 'keep the beat going' into the late 1970s and early 1980s. When WBOS changed to AOR/adult contemporary, the duo went to WBZ Radio for a long, successful stint there.\n\nIn January 1980, the station flipped to an adult contemporary music format which was a little less \"adult\" and a little more \"contemporary\", but that format would only run for two years. In January 1982, WBOS flipped to a short-lived attempt at an album rock format, programmed for some of that time by legendary Boston rock personalities Jerry Goodwin and Maxanne Satori.\n\nBut the rock format didn't make any inroads against established rockers like 104.1 WBCN, 94.5 WCOZ, and 107.3 WAAF, not to mention the fast-rising WLYN-FM. On July 14, 1983, WBOS' format was abruptly changed to country music, and was moderately successful for several years; it was the only FM country station in the Boston market at the time.\n\nProgram Director and morning personality Dean James, along with General Sales Manager Dave DiGregorio, worked diligently to bring country to the mainstream. Many local jocks are still working the Boston market. The country format would remain for the next six years.\n\nOn April 27, 1989 at 3:00 p.m., WBOS dropped country and adopted a \"triple-A\" format, initially with a bit more of an eclectic focus than most triple-A stations at the time, incorporating classic rock, soul, R&B, and singer-songwriter cuts into their playlists, along with new releases. Eventually, the station gravitated more toward current material and new releases. At that time, when CDs were just starting to be used in radio, WBOS promoted itself as the first all-compact disc radio station, eliminating vinyl, and very sparingly using carts for some songs. Unusually, the vinyl themed retro show \"The Lost 45s\" with Barry Scott aired on Sunday nights after leaving rival 100.7 WZLX.\n\nIn April 2005, WBOS made changes to play more music and decrease the amount of talk. The station's morning show, hosted by Bill Abbate and Kristin Lessard, was abruptly cancelled to make way for the jockless \"All Music Mornings\". \"It's putting the station somewhat back to where it started in terms of its ideals. Listener perception is that radio plays too many commercials and that DJs can be boring and irrelevant,\" said Buzz Knight, operations manager for WBOS. Knight said that WBOS will be \"the cool station for people over 30.\"\n\nIn September 2007, George Knight began hosting morning drive on the station, but that would be short lived. That same month, Greater Media registered domains that showed that the station was possibly flipping to sports talk as 92.9 The Ticket, complete with a logo and a slogan, \"Boston's Only FM Sports Station\". The station was rumored to flip on October 1 of that year, but never materialized. WBMX (now WBZ-FM) and WMKK (now WEEI-FM) eventually flipped to the format over the next five years. Little did anyone know a bigger change was coming to WBOS.\n\nOn February 1, 2008 at 5:00 p.m., the station saw its biggest change since flipping to AAA in 1989, as the format changed to alternative rock and the station rebranded as \"Radio 92-9\". While George Knight continued to host his popular \"Sunday Morning Over Easy\" program, and music director Dana Marshall was promoted to Program Director, the rest of the station's airstaff was let go. Since WBCN's demise in 2010, WBOS has adopted a mainstream rock direction, but continues to report on Mediabase and Nielsen BDS on the alternative panel. This was due to the addition of Def Leppard on the playlist, and the move left WFNX once again as Boston's only pure alternative rock station. However, in 2011 or 2012, the station reverted to playing mostly alternative tracks, while playing some classic hard rock tracks (but at a very minimal amount), usually from artists/bands such as Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Metallica, Pink Floyd, Billy Idol, and Guns N' Roses. By July 2012, WBOS became Boston's only alternative rock station following the closure of WFNX.\nOn July 13, 2016, WBOS rebranded as \"Alt 92.9\".\n\nIn July 2017, WBOS began carrying the Dave and Chuck The Freak morning show out of sister station WRIF. That same year, the station began broadcasting Boston Bruins hockey games that conflict with New England Patriots games, the arrangement followed Beasley's acquisition of WBZ-FM (98.5), the flagship station for both teams.\n\nOn April 11, 2019 at 10:30 a.m., following the \"Dave & Chuck the Freak Morning Show\" (and after playing \"Bury a Friend\" by Billie Eilish), WBOS flipped to classic rock, branded as \"Rock 92.9\". The first song on \"Rock\" was \"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" by AC/DC. The change follows a transition from classic rock to a more conventional classic hits format at sister station \nWROR-FM, leaving a space for a competitor to market powerhouse WZLX. \n\nWBOS was originally owned by Boston businessman Herbert Hoffman. In the 1980s, he sold it to Sconnix, which later sold it to Ackerley Media in 1988. The station was sold to Granum Communications in 1992, which merged with Infinity Broadcasting in 1996. In 1997, the station was traded to Greater Media.\n\nOn July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WBOS) for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, 2016 and the sale closed on November 1, 2016.\n\nWBOS is actively broadcasting using the iBiquity HD Radio digital broadcasting system, and had an HD secondary channel called \"The Coffee House\", which launched in early 2006. This format consisted of \"the acoustic, unplugged side of triple A\" by using the \"station’s archive of live and in-studio performances\", and emphasized \"singer-songwriters, folk music and unplugged versions of songs by core WBOS artists.\"\n\nThe \"Coffee House\" format would later be replaced with \"Radio You Boston\", featuring content programmed by college-aged residents of the Boston area. This has since re-branded as \"Local 92.9\", and features local music artists from the Boston area.\n\nOn July 3, 2017, Beasley announced that Bloomberg Radio programming would be moved from WXKS (AM) to sister WRCA and new translator W291CZ, and would be simulcasted on WBOS-HD2.\n\n\n\n"}

It is committed to promoting the experimental, theoretical, and applied analysis of behavior.\n\nThe Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) was founded in 1974 as the MidWestern Association for Behavior Analysis (MABA) to serve as an interdisciplinary group of professionals, paraprofessionals, and students. MABA was organized to establish a separate identity for the behavior analysis group of the larger psychological community and to provide a forum for the discussion of issues and the dissemination of information pertinent to the interests of its membership. The first annual conference was a response by a group of behavior analysts who were having problems presenting their work at psychology conferences and other related events. Some of the members included Sidney Bijou, James Dinsmoor, Bill Hopkins, and Roger Ulrich. The first headquarters were located on the campus of Western Michigan University (WMU) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The association changed its name to the Association for Behavior Analysis in 1979. In 2002, the headquarters were moved off WMU's campus. In 2008, the association relocated to nearby Portage, Michigan (where it is today), and added \"International\" to its name.

{"id": "2074845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074845", "title": "New World Computing", "text": "New World Computing\n\nNew World Computing, Inc. was an American video game developer and publisher founded in 1984 by Jon Van Caneghem, his wife, Michaela Van Caneghem, and Mark Caldwell. It was best known for its work on the Might and Magic role-playing video game series and its spin-offs, especially Heroes of Might and Magic. The company was purchased by and became a division of The 3DO Company on July 10, 1996 from NTN Communications, after NTN purchased New World Computing for $10 million in stock.\n\nAmidst financial turmoil, the 3DO Company laid off a large portion of the staff of New World Computing on April 15, 2002. While a smaller, core staff remained at New World Computing, the following year saw little improvement in parent 3DO's situation, and the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May of that year. Before dissolving later that year, 3DO sold the rights to the \"Might and Magic\" series to Ubisoft. As an in-house development studio of the 3DO Company, New World Computing ceased to exist with the dissolution of its parent organization.\n\nThe first \"Might and Magic\" game, \"\", was programmed by Jon Van Caneghem for over a three-year period ending in 1986. Released for the Apple II on June 1, 1986, with ports for the Commodore 64, classic Mac OS, and MS-DOS following a year later, the game was successful enough to warrant a sequel, \"\", released for the Apple II and MS-DOS in 1988.\n\nThe third installment, \"\" was released in 1991 and was the first game in the series designed specifically for MS-DOS-based computers, although ports were released for a variety of other systems, including the classic Mac OS, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and the Sega Mega Drive. \"Might and Magic III\" featured an entirely redesigned game engine and 8-bit VGA graphics.\n\nThe \"Might and Magic III\" engine was reused for the next two installments of the series, \"\" and \"\", released in 1992 and 1993, respectively. When installed together, the two games became a single, omnibus-style title called \"\". In 1994, New World released an enhanced CD-ROM version of \"World of Xeen\" featuring Red Book CD audio and spoken dialog. The \"Might and Magic III\" engine was used one final time for \"Swords of Xeen\", a continuation of \"World of Xeen\" produced by Catware under permission from New World Computing. Although it was never released as a standalone title, \"Swords of Xeen\" was included in numerous \"Might and Magic\" series compilations released by New World Computing and, later, the 3DO Company.\n\nAfter a pause of five years (during which time the Heroes of Might and Magic spin-off franchise was launched) New World returned to the Might and Magic series with \"\", their first game to use 3D graphics, and the first to be released for Microsoft Windows. \"\" (1999) and \"\" (2000) followed, using the same engine, but adding support for graphical hardware acceleration. In late 2001, \"Might and Magic VIII\" was released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in the Japanese market only, courtesy of developer Imagineer.\n\nAlso in 2001, New World and 3DO released \"Legends of Might and Magic\", a spin-off of the \"Might and Magic\" series. Originally conceived as an online multiplayer action role-playing game (and announced as such when it was unveiled at E3 in 2000), by the time of the game's release the following year it had evolved into a more traditional first-person shooter.\n\nThe next \"Might and Magic\" game was released in 2002 as \"Might and Magic IX\" for Windows. Abandoning the now-dated \"Might and Magic VI\" engine in favor of the Lithtech engine (also used in \"Legends of Might and Magic\"), \"Might and Magic IX\" was the first game in the series to be rendered entirely in 3D. Unfortunately, the release of the game was rushed, and the finished product was received poorly by critics, who noted the numerous software bugs remaining in the final release, most of which were not fully resolved by the sole patch released before New World Computing's dissolution. The most current game, released by Ubisoft in 2014, is Might and Magic X.\n\nBefore its bankruptcy, the 3DO Company produced two further spin-offs of the \"Might and Magic\" series: \"Crusaders of Might and Magic\" and \"Warriors of Might and Magic\". Neither of these games was developed by New World Computing, however. Similarly, a number of \"Might and Magic\" spin-off titles have been produced since the dissolution of New World Computing by Ubisoft and its associates. New World Computing was not involved in the production of any of these (including \"Dark Messiah of Might and Magic\").\n\nIn 1990, New World Computing released \"King's Bounty\", a turn-based tactical role-playing game, for the Apple II, MS-DOS, classic Mac OS, the Commodore 64, and the Amiga. The game, designed by New World co-founder Jon Van Caneghem, was subsequently modified to include real-time elements and ported to the Sega Mega Drive video game console. Four years later, New World would revisit the basic mechanics of the home-computer versions of \"King's Bounty\" with \"\", released for MS-DOS. In 1996, an enhanced version of the game was released for Windows 95.\n\nFollowing the success of the first \"Heroes\" game, New World released \"Heroes of Might and Magic II\" for Windows 95 and the classic Mac OS. An expansion pack, entitled \"The Price of Loyalty\" was designed by Cyberlore Studios and released by New World Computing in 1997 for Windows 95 only. The combined game and its expansion were subsequently re-released together as \"Heroes of Might and Magic II Gold\".\n\nIn 1999, \"Heroes of Might and Magic III\" was released for Windows and the classic Mac OS. The Windows release was quickly followed by the \"\" expansion pack later that year and \"\" expansion pack in early 2000. Neither of the two expansion packs were released separately for Mac OS, although an omnibus release, entitled \"Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete\" was released for both Windows and Mac OS shortly thereafter. Loki Software produced a Linux port of the original \"Heroes III\" in 2000, but neither of the two expansions were made available.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2001, New World Computing used a limited version of the \"Heroes of Might and Magic III\" game engine in a series of eight episodic titles released under the \"Heroes Chronicles\" umbrella. Two of these games (\"The World Tree\" and \"The Fiery Moon\") were only available for online download to consumers who purchased other installments of the series.\n\nIn 2001, an enhanced remake of the original \"King's Bounty\" was released for the \"PlayStation 2\" video game console. The game was marketed as part of the \"Heroes\" franchise and released under the title \"\".\n\n\"Heroes of Might and Magic IV\" was released for Windows in 2002 alongside \"Might and Magic IX\", and featured a major overhaul of the series' gameplay. Like the previous \"Heroes\" game, two expansion packs were released: \"\" in late 2002, and \"\" in 2003. \"The Winds of War\" was the last title to be developed by New World Computing prior to its dissolution following the bankruptcy of 3DO.\n\nSubsequent games in the \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" series were developed by Nival Interactive and released by Ubisoft. In addition, the rights to the \"King's Bounty\" name were purchased in 2007 by Russian publisher 1C Company, who released \"\" the following year (developed by Katauri Interactive).\n\nThroughout its existence, New World Computing focused primarily on the \"Might and Magic\" series and its various spin-offs. Early in its existence, however, the company was involved in the development of several unrelated video games, typically in the role-playing video game genre. The company also served as the publisher for a number of games, including \"Spaceward Ho!\", developed by Delta Tao Software, and Empire Deluxe by Mark Baldwin and Bob Rakowsky. After being absorbed into the 3DO Company, New World Computing devoted its energies solely to game development, and worked exclusively on the \"Might and Magic\" franchise thereafter.\n\nIn 1989, New World Computing developed the satirical game \"Nuclear War\", based on the Flying Buffalo card game of the same name. While this was not particularly successful from a financial perspective, it was notable as a departure from the company's traditional field of role-playing video games.\n"}

{"id": "2074847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074847", "title": "Berlin State Library", "text": "Berlin State Library\n\nThe Berlin State Library (; officially abbreviated as \"SBB\", colloquially \"Stabi\") is a universal library in Berlin, Germany and a property of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. It is one of the largest libraries in Europe, and one of the most important academic research libraries in the German-speaking world. It collects texts, media and cultural works from all fields in all languages, from all time periods and all countries of the world, which are of interest for academic and research purposes. Some famous items in its collection include the oldest biblical illustrations in the fifth-century Quedlinburg Itala fragment, a Gutenberg Bible, the main autograph collection of Goethe, the world's largest collection of Johann Sebastian Bach's and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's manuscripts, and the original score of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.\n\nThe SBB is one of six libraries forming the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Sammlung Deutscher Drucke (AG SDD) which \"collaborate to build a comprehensive collection of printed literature published in German-speaking countries from the beginning of letterpress printing to the present, to provide information on it, to make it accessible to the public and to preserve it for future generations.\" This creates a virtual or distributed national library, in which each library is responsible for a given period, of which the SBB covers 1871–1912 for regular prints, 1801–1912 for maps and newspapers, and 1801–1945 for musical scores.\n\nWithin the cooperation of German and Austrian libraries, the SBB is responsible \"for the maintenance and further development of the ZDB\", the central periodicals database. \"The ZDB actually contains more than 1.8 million bibliographic records of serials from the 16th century onward, from all countries, in all languages, held in 3.700 German and Austrian libraries, with 15.6 million holdings information. It does not contain contents, i. e. journal articles.\"\n\nThe SBB is one of 12 libraries and archives with significant holdings of historical documents which form the -- \"Alliance to Preserve Written Cultural Heritage\". This alliance sets itself as main task raising the consciousness of the importance to preserve the century-old cultural heritage both by securing the physical integrity of the objects in question as well as making them available in digitized form, thus preventing their deterioration by use.\n\nThe SBB itself is digitizing their holdings and offers digitized newspapers for public access via the Web in their \"newspaper information system\" ZEFYS or \"Zeitungsinformationssystem\". ZEFYS \"currently provides total of 281.990 issues from 192 historical newspapers from Germany and foreign newspapers in german.\"\n\nThe history of the Berlin State Library closely parallels that of German history. It has lived through creation, neglect, expansion, war damage, division, unification and re-creation like few other libraries.\n\nIn the early period, the fortunes of the State Library rose and fell on royal whims. In 1658 Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg decreed that his private books be organized, cataloged and made available to the public. His library opened in 1661 at Cölln as the \"Library of the Elector\" (). In 1699, Frederick I more than doubled the collection, extended opening hours and introduced the first Prussian legal deposit law. In 1701 it was renamed the \"Royal Library\" () upon Frederick I's accession as first King of Prussia. Frederick William I then cancelled the acquisition budget in 1722 and gave away the valuable scientific collection to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1735. Frederick the Great also cared little for the library at first, preferring instead his own literature in the French language. However, in 1770 he granted the library substantial assets and it made several important acquisitions. To avoid the problems caused by its dependence on the crown, Frederick the Great also granted the library considerable autonomy.\n\nWith new resources and authority, construction began on a Royal Library building on the Bebelplatz in the center of Berlin. Built between 1775 and 1785 by Georg Christian Unger to plans by Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach, it was nicknamed the \"Kommode\" (\"Chest of drawers\") after its Neo Baroque design. The collection then underwent nearly continuous improvement and expansion. By 1905 it had become the largest and most influential repository of materials in the German language, and at 1.2 million books one of the largest libraries in the world. The Bebelplatz building housed the library until 1914, when the headquarters moved into new, even larger premises on the Unter den Linden: the climax of the library's development before the First World War. Today the old Royal building houses the Faculty of Law of Humboldt University.\n\nAt the founding of the Weimar Republic the library was renamed the \"Prussian State Library\" (). After 1919, economic effects of war and inflation on the library were mitigated through the active support of the Emergency Association of German Sciences (after 1930, the German Research Foundation).\n\nThe Nazi period severely damaged the institution through political intimidation, employee dismissals, restrictions on foreign acquisitions and the effects of World War II. On 10 May 1933 a book burning ceremony was held at the Bebelplatz by members of the Deutsche Studentenschaft, the National Socialist German Students' League, Sturmabteilung \"brownshirts\" and Hitler Youth groups at the instigation of the Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels. The Nazis burned over 20,000 books - mostly from the neighboring University, not the State library itself – including works by Thomas Mann, Erich Maria Remarque, Heinrich Heine, Karl Marx and many others. Today a glass plate set into the Bebelplatz, giving a view of empty bookcases, commemorates the event. After an Allied bomb hit the Unter den Linden building in 1941, the various holdings (now some 3 million volumes and over 7,400 incunabula) were evacuated to 30 monasteries, castles and abandoned mines around Germany. By the end of the war, the main building was severely damaged, the valuable collections distributed across Allied zones of occupation, the library staff had been killed or scattered, and 700,000 volumes either destroyed or lost. With the formal dissolution of the State of Prussia in 1947, support for the library ended and the Prussian State Library ceased to exist.\n\nAfter 1945, parts of the collection that had been hidden in what became the Soviet occupation zone were returned to the war-damaged Unter den Linden building in East Berlin. It first opened in 1946 as the \"Public Scientific Library\" (). When further restoration work was completed in 1955, the library was renamed the \"German State Library\" (). The great domed reading room, however, remained a ruin in the center of the building.\n\nA larger proportion of the collection wound up in the American occupation zone, including a cache of 1.5 million volumes hidden in a potash mine near Hattorf, and was moved to the University of Marburg in 1946. This collection first opened to the public as the \"Hessian Library\" () and in 1949, as the last lost stores arrived, it was renamed the \"West German Library\" (). Those parts of the collection that had been in the French occupation zone, mainly at Beuron Archabbey, were gathered to the University of Tübingen. In 1962 the Federal Republic passed a law giving administrative responsibility for all these collections to Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and endowed it with State funding. During the 1960s, the various stocks, services and personnel began to be relocated to West Berlin. To house it all, a grand new building complex on the Kulturforum was constructed near the Berlin Wall, just 1.5 km away from the library in East Berlin.\n\nAfter German Reunification, the two institutions were formally reunited in 1992. The new West Berlin building and the original East Berlin building became \"one library with two homes\" and the old State Library was reborn as the \"Berlin State Library\". From 2000 until 2012 Berlin State Library was refurbished by German architect HG Merz. The destroyed reading room, the core of the building, was replaced by a glass cube.\n\nMany important items from the original collection are now located in Poland and territories of the former Soviet Union - declared as war reparations, sometimes controversially - such as the \"Berlinka Art Collection\". The original score of Beethoven's 8th Symphony is a starker example of division: while the first, second and fourth movements are in Berlin, the third is kept in Kraków. Conversely, it is estimated that about 10,000 volumes and 9,000 other items in the Berlin State Library are there as a result of Nazi plunder. Repatriation and self-criticism about these materials suffered from neglect, so in 2005 the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation established the Center for Provenance Research to speed up the process. Sometimes, however, the past cannot be mended. In 2008 a Library user found an encyclopedia entitled \"Religion in History and the Present Day\" with a bookplate indicating it once belonged to a Jewish theologian. Library staff managed to find his widow in Israel, but she wrote back: \"I appreciate your offer to return this book to me, but I have no use for it now.\" \n\nThe State Library operates from two major public sites, Haus Unter Den Linden and Haus Potsdamer Straße, called the \"Library in Two Homes\". There are additional subsidiary locations for newspapers, magazines, and archives not open to the public.\n\nThe original main building was built between 1908 and 1913 by the \"Prussian Construction and Financial Direction of Berlin\", then responsible for public constructions in the city. The Neo Baroque design is by popular Wilhelmine court architect Ernst von Ihne and was further adapted by Alexander Baerwald, who was in charge of the construction management. In front of the building is an equestrian statue of Frederick the Great. The building was 40% damaged during World War II, and after the division of Berlin wound up in East Berlin. It is undergoing a major expansion by HG Merz, including a new translucent central reading room on the ruins of the old dome, and will become the main historical research library housing the collection up to and including 1945.\n\nThis is the newer building in the Kulturforum on Potsdamer Straße in West Berlin, designed by Hans Scharoun with substantial participation by Edgar Wisniewski. Construction began in 1967 to house those parts of the library's evacuated holdings from the western Allied occupation zones at the end of World War II. After 11 years of construction, it was finally dedicated by Federal President Walter Scheel and opened to the public in 1978. It was renovated from 1999 to 2001. The building is currently being further redeveloped into a modern research library as a companion to the Haus Unter den Linden and will house the collection from 1946 onwards.\n\n\n\nAmong the library's most precious treasures are the Psalter of Ludwig the German () dating from the 9th century and an elaborately adorned copy of the Gutenberg Bible. The oldest handwritten book in the collection is a Coptic codex of the biblical Book of Proverbs dating from the 3rd century; the oldest printed book is an 8th-century Buddhist text from Japan, the Hyakumantó Darani.\n\nThe library also has an extensive collection of important music manuscripts, including 80% of all the autographs of Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the largest collection in the world. Famous examples include Bach's Mass in B Minor, the St. Matthew and St. John Passions, and nearly all of Mozart's operas. In addition to Ludwig van Beethoven's 4th, 5th, and 8th Symphonies, the Library also holds the autograph score, autograph leaves, and historic records of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, which was added to UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in 2001.\n\nOther notable items are a 1491 Map of Germany by Nikolaus von Kues, the Atlas of The Great Elector (), the Jahangir-Album from around 1600, and the largest Hebrew Bible and the largest parchment Torah scroll in the world.\n\nSeveral notable scholars have held positions at the library, among them:\n\nThe western library played a starring role in Wim Wenders' \"Wings of Desire\". Two angels, the stars of the film, read the thoughts of the library's patrons.\n\n\n"}

Gion Matsuri is one of the largest festivals in Japan for purification and pacification of disease causing entities . It takes place in the month of July on the 17th and 24th. There are many ceremonies held during the festival, but it is best known for its parade, the . The festival takes place at the Yasaka Shrine and the festival gets its name from the Gion district of the city .\n\nKyoto's downtown area is reserved for pedestrian traffic on the three nights leading up to the massive parade. These nights are known as \"yoiyama\" (宵山) on July 16 and July 23, \"yoiyoiyama\" (宵々山) on July 15 and July 22, and \"yoiyoiyoiyama\" (宵々々山) on July 14 and July 21. The streets are lined with night stalls selling food such as \"yakitori\" (barbecued chicken on skewers), \"taiyaki\", \"takoyaki\", \"okonomiyaki\", traditional Japanese sweets, and many other culinary delights. Women dressed in \"yukata\" (summer kimono) walk around the area, carrying with them traditional purses and paper fans.\n\nDuring the \"yoiyama\" evenings leading up to the parade, some private houses in the old kimono merchant district open their entryways to the public, exhibiting family heirlooms in a custom known as the \"Byōbu Matsuri\", or Folding Screen Festival. This provides visitors with an opportunity to visit and observe traditional Japanese residences.\n\nThis festival originated during an epidemic in 869 as part of a purification ritual (\"goryo-e\") to appease the gods thought to cause fire, floods and earthquakes. In 869, when people were suffering from a plague attributed to the rampaging deity , Emperor Seiwa ordered prayers to the god of the Yasaka Shrine, Susanoo-no-Mikoto. Sixty-six stylized and decorated halberds, one for each of the traditional provinces of Japan, were prepared and erected at Shinsen-en, a garden, along with portable shrines (\"mikoshi\") from Yasaka Shrine. This practice was repeated wherever an outbreak of plague occurred. In 970, the festival became an annual event and it has since seldom failed to take place. During the Ashikaga shogunate, late 15th and early 16th century, the festival was halted. Later in the 16th century it was revived by Nobunaga .Over time the increasingly powerful and influential merchant class made the festival more elaborate and, by the Edo period (1603–1868), it was using the parade to brandish its wealth.\n\nSmaller floats lost or damaged over the centuries have been restored, and the weavers of the Nishijin area offer new tapestries to replace destroyed ones. When they are not in use, the floats and regalia are kept in special storehouses throughout the central merchant district of Kyoto.\n\nThe festival serves as an important setting in Yasunari Kawabata's novel, \"The Old Capital\" in which he describes the festival, along with the Festival of Ages and the Aoi Festival, as \"the 'three great festivals' of the old capital\".\n\nFollowing is a list of selected annual events in the Gion Festival.\n\nThe floats in the Yoiyama Parade are divided into two groups, the larger Hoko (\"halberd\") and the smaller Yama (\"mountain\"), and are collectively called Yamaboko (or Yamahoko) . The nine Hoko represent the 66 halberds or spears used in the original purification ritual, and the 23 Yama carry life-sized figures of famous people. All the floats are decorated with tapestries, some made in Nishijin, the textile district of Kyoto, others imported from all over the world. Musicians sit in the floats playing drums and flutes . The floats are pulled with ropes down the street and good luck favors are thrown from the floats to the crowd .In 1979 Yamahoko was listed on the Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties. And in 2009 Yamahoko was listed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nOn the 17th the floats take the Guardian Gods from the shrine to the center of the city to a temporary dwelling . They reside here for a week and are available to parishioners . On the 24th they are taken back to the Yasaka Shrine to their permanent dwelling . On the way back to the shrine, the procession stop at the Imperial garden. At the garden the Gauardian Gods are met with offerings of food, music, and dance.\n\nEach year the families that maintain the floats draw lots at a special meeting to determine in what order they will take part in the festival. These lots are issued at a special ceremony before the parade, during which the Mayor of Kyoto dons the robes of a magistrate. On the \"Naginata Hoko\" is the \"chigo\", a young boy in Shinto robes and crowned with a golden phoenix, chosen from among the Kyoto merchant families as the deity's sacred page. After weeks of special purification ceremonies, during which he lives isolated from contaminating influences such as the presence of women, he is carried onto the float, as he is not permitted to touch the ground. The boy must cut a sacred rope (\"shimenawa\") with a single stroke to begin the festival.\n\n\n\n"}

He was famous for his works on historical and religious subjects.\n\nNikolai Ge was born in Voronezh to a Russian noble family of French origin. His grandfather immigrated to Russia during the 18th century. His parents died while he was a child. Ge was raised by a serf nurse. He graduated from the first Kiev Gymnasium and then studied physics and mathematics at Kiev University and Saint Petersburg University.\n\nIn 1850, Ge gave up his career in science and enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. He studied under master painter Pyotr Basin. In 1857, he graduated from the Academy where he received a gold medal for \"The Witch of Endor Invoking the Spirit of the Prophet Samuel\". According to Ge, during that period he was strongly influenced by Karl Briullov.\n\nThe gold medal secured a scholarship for Ge to study abroad. He visited Germany, Switzerland and France. In 1860 he settled in Italy where he met Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov in Rome. The Russian artist became a strong influence to Ge's future works.\n\nIn 1861, Ge painted \"The Last Supper\" using a photograph of Aleksandr Ivanovich Herzen as an image for his central figure of Christ. The photograph was taken by Herzen's cousin, Russian photographer Sergei Lvovich Levitsky.\n\nGe recounted, \"I wanted to go to London to paint Alexander Herzen |Herzen's portrait [...] and he responded to my request with a large portrait by Mr. Levitsky.\" The final painting's similarity between the pose of Levitsky's photo of Herzen and Ge's pose of the painted Christ led the press of the day to hail the painting as \"a triumph of materialism and nihilism.\"\n\nThis was the first known occasion where photography was used as the main source for a central character in a painting and speaks to the deep influences that photography would have later on in art and artistic movements like French Impressionism.\n\nThe painting (first purchased by Tsar Alexander II of Russia) made such a strong impression when it was shown in Saint Petersburg in 1863 that Ge was made a professor of Imperial Academy of Arts.\n\nIn 1864, Ge returned to Florence and painted Herzen's portrait along with the \"Messengers of the Resurrection\" and the first version of \"Christ on the Mount of Olives\". The new paintings were not much of a success and the Imperial Academy refused to exhibit them in its annual exhibition.\n\nIn 1870, Ge again returned to Saint Petersburg where he turned to Russian history for subject matter. The painting \"Peter the Great Interrogates Tsarevich Alexey at Peterhof\" (1871) was a great success, but his other historical paintings were met with little to no interest. Ge wrote that a man should live off of farming and art should not be for sale. He bought a small khutor (farm) in Chernigov gubernia (currently Ukraine) and moved there. Ge became acquainted with Leo Tolstoy around this time and became a follower of his philosophy.\n\nIn the early 1880s, he returned to religious subjects and portraits. He claimed that everyone had the right to have a personal portrait and agreed to work for whatever commission the subject could afford. Among his later portrait subjects were Tolstoy, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin and the biblical Judas.\n\nHis later paintings on New Testament subjects were praised by liberal critics like Vladimir Stasov and criticized by conservatives for illustrating Ernest Renan rather than the New Testament and were banned forbidden by authorities for blasphemy. \"Quid Est Veritas? Christ and Pilate\" (1890) was also banned from an exhibition. \"The Judgment of the Sanhedrin: He is Guilty!\" (1892) was not admitted to the annual Academy of Arts exhibition; \"The Calvary (Golgotha)\" (1893) remained unfinished; \"The Crucifixion\" (1894) was banned by Tsar Alexander III.\n\nGe died on his farm in 1894. The fate of many of his works remains a mystery. Ge had bequeathed all of his works to his Swiss benefactress, Beatrice de Vattville in exchange for a small stipend from her during his lifetime. When she died in 1952, none of Ge's works was found in her castle. Among the lost works is Ge's supposedly magnum opus painting \"The Crucifixion\".\n\nGe's drawings were later discovered by art collectors in Swiss second-hand stores as late as 1974. Many \"were acquired by a young collector, Christoph Bolman [...] he had no idea of their origin, simply recognizing their value. Only some 15 years later, when he was visited during the Perestroika by Soviet acquaintances, did the attribution become clear. Negotiations for their acquisition and return to Russia – as a full collection, rather than sold off in parts – failed repeatedly during the 1990s. They were only concluded in 2011 after the Tretyakov Gallery was able to arrange sponsorship from a Russian state bank to purchase them for donation to the gallery's permanent collection.\"\n\n\n\n"}

In spite of various biographical details having been created, there are no unambiguous records of his existence except in the patronymics of his sons, García and Íñigo \"Jiménez\", indicating a father named Jimeno. In 850, the French court received envoys from \"Induo\" and \"Mitio\", \"dukes of the Navarrese\", and it has been supposed that these names represent those of Íñigo Arista and Jimeno, but Sánchez Albornoz argued against the latter identification. Likewise it has been suggested that, like his son, he may have been ruler of \"another part of the kingdom\" of Pamplona, or even that he was regent of the entire kingdom (for which there is no evidence). The location of his hypothetical principality has been placed around Álava, where a count Vela Jiménez, traditionally thought to have been his son (again based on patronymic), held sway.\n\nHe has sometimes been described as Jimeno the Strong, but this results from confusion with a much earlier man of that name. Likewise, he sometimes appears as Jimeno Garcés due to hypotheses about his origins. The belief that he was kinsman of Íñigo I Arista has led to various reconstructed pedigrees, filling the gaps with otherwise unknown or chronologically misplaced individuals, the most common version making him son of a García Jiménez, and thereby making \"Garcés\" the patronymic of Jimeno.\n\nIf he ruled, he was apparently succeeded in his principality by son García Jiménez. He is noteworthy as the earliest documented ancestor of a royal house—the Jiménez—that displaced the line of Arista in 905 and reigned in Navarre until 1234.\n\nNo record of his wife remains, although historian Justo Pérez de Urbel has suggested that he was the unnamed prince of Pamplona who married Leodegundia Ordoñez, daughter of King Ordoño I of Asturias. Sánchez Albornoz harbors no doubts that Leodegundia married a king of Pamplona, as mentioned in the \"Códice de Roda\" when she is called Domna \"Leodegundia Regina\", nevertheless, he believes that she would have married a reigning king, not Jimeno of Pamplona, who would also have been much too old for her and that, in any case, the most likely candidate would have been either García Íñiguez or his son Fortún Garcés.\n\nJimeno had at least two children, both documented:\n\n\nIt has also been suggested that he was the father of two other children, although both hypotheses have been contested:\n\n\n"}

His name at birth was Avigdor David Brenner (\"Avigdor ben Gershon,\" in Hebrew, as his gravestone attests), but he changed the name to Victor David Brenner.\nHe emigrated to the United States in 1890, living mostly in the New York City area. When Brenner arrived in America, he had little more to fall back upon except the trade taught him by his father — gem and seal engraving. This technical preparation included the tools of the sculptor's craft. He took night classes at Cooper Union. Brenner soon mastered English as he had mastered French.\n\nEight years later Brenner was in Paris, studying with the great French medalist, Oscar Roty at the Académie Julian. There he exhibited his work and obtained awards at the Paris Exposition of 1900. He returned to the United States, and from that time on his career prospered. He appeared to be on his way to the fulfillment of the splendid predictions made for his future by Rodin.\n\nBrenner died in 1924 and is buried at Mount Judah Cemetery, Ridgewood, Queens County, New York.\n\nBrenner is probably best known for his enduring Lincoln coin design, the obverse of which is the longest-running design in United States Mint history, and perhaps the most reproduced piece of art in world history. Brenner's design had been picked by 26th U.S. President, Theodore Roosevelt, who had earlier posed for him in New York. Since arriving nineteen years earlier in the United States, Brenner had become one of the nation's premier medalists. Roosevelt had learned of Brenner's talents in a settlement house on New York City's Lower East Side and was immediately impressed with a bas-relief that Brenner had made of Lincoln, based on the early Civil War era photographer, Mathew Brady's photograph.\n\nRoosevelt, who considered Lincoln the savior of the Union, the greatest Republican President and also considered himself Lincoln's political heir, ordered the new Lincoln penny to be based on Brenner's work and that it be produced to commemorate Lincoln's 100th birthday in 1909. The likeness of President Lincoln on the obverse of the coin is an adaptation of a plaque Brenner executed several years earlier and which had come to the attention of President Roosevelt in New York.\n\nBronze bas-reliefs dated 1907 and signed by Brenner have been identified and some sold in auctions for as much as $3,900.\n\nCharles Eliot Norton of Harvard, whom Brenner counted among his friends, gave the sculptor an unpublished portrait of Lincoln which served Brenner as a basis for Lincoln's features. He also examined other portraits.\n\nWhen Brenner forwarded the model of the Lincoln cent to the Director of the Mint, the design bore his whole name, after the fashion of the signatures on the coinage of other countries, notably on the gold coins which Oscar Roty designed for France. The Director, however, decided to have the initials substituted for the name.\n\nFollowing the precedent of James B. Longacre, whose initials \"JBL\" (or simply \"L\") graced a number of U.S. coin designs for much of the latter half of the 19th century, Brenner placed his initials \"VDB\" at the bottom of the reverse between the wheat ear stalks.\n\nWidespread criticism of the initials' prominence resulted in their removal midway through 1909, the design's first year of issue. In 1918, Brenner's initials returned as small letters below Lincoln's shoulder, where they remain today. (The incorporation of the designer's initials into a coin design is now commonplace in the U.S.)\nA 1909 VDB US cent was mounted on the calibration target on the Mars \"Curiosity\" rover. This is a nod to the rover's geologic mission and the common practice by geologists including a coin in photographs to document the size of objects.\n\nSome of Brenner's most noteworthy sculptural works include: \n\n\n"}

Instead food is passed around all day long and the crew works continuously. The lack of a lunch break means that crew members and the cast have to steal moments to eat. Joel Schumacher employed French hours when filming \"Phone Booth\", a film completed in 10 days. Ridley Scott also used the approach when filming \"Robin Hood\", noting that actors often had to eat on horseback between takes. Scott also agreed with the cast and crew that he would adhere strictly to a 10 hour shooting day due to lack of a traditional lunch break. \n\nIn accordance with union rules and the SAG contract, what traditionally takes place when French hours are instituted is that the cast and crew are remunerated in the form of \"meal penalties\". In the film and television industry, the cast and crew are required to be officially broken for lunch six hours after their initial call time. Meal penalties are monetary compensation that are incurred every half hour after the six-hour deadline until a meal break is given, or the shoot day ends. On a film like \"Phone Booth\", it would not be unusual for the cast and crew to receive 20 or more meal penalties.\n\nIn parts of Canada and the United States, French hours are referred to as \"Pacific North West Hours\", or simply \"PNW Hours\" or \"PNW\".\n"}

García is presumed to have succeeded his father in this role, either during the lifetime of King García Íñiguez or of his son King Fortún Garcés, and is called \"king\" by the \"Códice de Roda\", being of \"another part of the kingdom\" of Pamplona.\n\nThere is no documentary evidence of García Jiménez playing any role in the government of the greater kingdom. However, such a role has been assigned to him. In 860, Fortún Garcés son and heir of king García Íñiguez, was imprisoned in Córdoba, and was kept there for 20 years. The traditional death date of García Íñiguez in 870 would have meant there was a \"de facto\" 10-year interregnum before the return of Fortún to the kingdom. It has been suggested that García Jiménez was called 'king' due to his service as regent during this period, lasting until he was killed at Aybar (882) in a battle against the Emir of Córdoba. On this basis, he is sometimes called García II. However, an alternative reconstruction would make the 882 casualty identical to García Íñiguez himself, thus allowing him to survive past his son's return, in which case no interregnum existed. There are likewise several references to a Sancho (presumably the son of García Íñiguez and younger brother of captive Fortún) being lord of Pamplona or 'king' in the 860s and 870s.\n\nThe \"Códice de Roda\" shows García Jiménez to have married twice, firstly to Oneca, \"Rebel of Sangüesa\" with whom he had two children:\n\n\nGarcía Jiménez married secondly Dadildis de Pallars, sister of count Raymond I of Pallars and Ribagorza, having by her two sons:\n\n\n"}

It is located about halfway between Las Vegas, and Taos on Highway 518, at an altitude of 7,180 feet. The Republic of Texas performed a semi-official raid on Mora in 1843. Two short battles of Mexican–American War were fought in Mora in 1847, where US troops eventually defeated the Hispano and Puebloan militia, effectively ending the Taos Revolt in the Mora Valley. The latter battle destroyed most of the community, necessitating its re-establishment.\n\nMora is today three plazas and four settlements: Mora proper, Cleveland (originally named San Antonio), and Chacon with plazas, and Holman (without a plaza, and originally named Agua Negra) lying between Chacon and Cleveland. In the mid-19th century, there were just two settlements, Upper and Lower Mora.\n\nSpanish settlers had sporadically occupied what is now known as the Mora Valley since the late 18th century. The surviving written history of the settlement of Mora dates to 1818, when a group of settlers petitioned to build a church in what was then named Lo de Mora;, or in long form ; they had come from (originally Caypa Pueblo, and today named Ohkay Owingeh).\n\nHowever, Mora was formally founded as a Hispanic farming community – after Mexican independence from Spain – upon a land grant issued September 28, 1835, by Centralist Republic of Mexico Governor of Nuevo Mexico Albino Pérez, It provided title to a strip of Mora Valley land to each of dozens of families willing to settle there. Despite fanciful stories about subsistence on berries (\"mora\" means 'mulberry' in Spanish), the valley, the river, the town, and eventually the county appear to have taken their name from the family name Mora, borne by several of the settlers. While mulberry trees are found in the area, they are not native to the Americas and thus were brought by Spanish or later settlers.\n\nThe whole of eastern New Mexico was claimed by the breakaway Republic of Texas in 1836, and became nominally US territory after of the Texas annexation in 1845, but was treated by the US and many residents as a militarily occupied territory until 1848.\n\nThe settlement, of Hispanos from elsewhere in New Mexico and local Puebloans, was well established by 1843, when there was a raid on the town by freebooters from the Republic of Texas under Colonel Charles A. Warfield claiming that the people in Mora had purchased stolen Texan cattle from the Comanche. The Texans killed five men and took eighteen women and children captive, as well as 75 horses. The people of the Mora Valley convened a posse, overtook the Texans, and sent them back to Texas on foot.\n\nMora was subject to occupying United States control under the US provisional government of New Mexico beginning in 1846, during the Mexican–American war. The town, then consisting of the two settlements of Upper and Lower Mora, (sometimes misspelled \"Moro\" in American documents of the era) was the site of two armed conflicts between United States Army troops and a militia of Hispano and Puebloan Mexican-nationalists, in the Taos Revolt, a guerilla campaign of the war. In the First Battle of Mora, on January 24, 1847, a group of over 150 New Mexican resistance fighters repelled an expedition of 80 US Army troops, and killed their commander, Captain Israel R. Hendley, and several others. On February 1, Capt. Jesse I. Morin and his 200 men, with artillery, destroyed the village and surrounding ranches and crops, in retaliation. This sent surviving combatant and civilian residents of Mora and its environs fleeing into and over the mountains to other settlements. The town was rebuilt some time later, after crops could be re-established. This destruction has made historical and genealogical research on Mora difficult beyond 1848, because most early records went up in flames with the buildings.\n\nThe entire war ended February 3, 1848, with all of New Mexico then under official US control, as the Mexican Cession of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo relinquished all claims by Mexico to lands north of the Rio Grande. The New Mexico Territory was formalized by the Compromise of 1850. The US Army controversially built Fort Union in 1851 on private Mora Grant land in the valley, along the Santa Fe Trail; while this sparked decades of unresolved legal actions, local farmers sold crops to the fort, which was a new and reliable source of income to the community, and the population swelled. Ceran St. Vrain, an American veteran of the Taos Revolt (originally from St. Louis in what was then the French Upper Louisiana Territory), settled in Mora in 1853; he built a grist mill, and became a major supplier of flour, grain, and fodder to the fort. The ruins of St. Vrain's mill still sit one block north of Mora's main street.\n\nThe county of Mora was established in the territory on February 1, 1860. Mora continued to grow as an agricultural community; by the late 19th century, there were five mills operating in Mora, though Fort Union, after being rebuilt for a second time, was finally closed in 1891. The population peaked around 1920, declined markedly for several decades, then stabilized in the 1970s. It remains about 80% hispanic. \n\nOne of Frank Waters's most popular novels, \"People of the Valley\" () takes place high in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains where an isolated Spanish-speaking community (based on Mora) confront a threatening world of change. The settlement is mentioned in Willa Cather's 1927 historical novel \"Death Comes for the Archbishop\"(Book Two, Chapter 2), about the establishment of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe. Mora was also in Louis L'Amour's Western novel \"The Daybreakers\", in which the character Orrin Sackett is the fictional marshal of Mora.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1986, with 90% of the facility's storage space occupied by his collection, he bought the building and established The Wolfsonian Foundation in order to oversee the collection and make it available to researchers and scholars for research. He hired Peggy Loar, as the Foundation's founding director, who brought in experts in the fields to begin to document, research, and publish what the collection held.\n\nIn 1992, Wolfson hired the architect Mark Hampton to expand and renovate the Washington Storage Company building and convert it into a museum and research center. Hampton, in collaboration with architect William Kearns, transformed the building to include a sleekly modernist lobby, museum café and shop, and, upstairs, permanent and temporary galleries dramatically arranged around light wells, a library, offices, and storage. The museum opened to the public in 1995.\n\nLoar departed the museum in fall 1996 and the Foundation Board hired Cathy Leff, then-vice president of The Wolfson Initiative Corporation and executive editor and publisher of The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, to step in as interim director. On behalf of Wolfson and the Board, Cathy Leff negotiated the gifting of the collection and its state-of-the-art museum facility to Florida International University. The acquisition of this gift was approved by the Florida State Legislature in 1997, and The Wolfsonian officially became a department of the Florida International University in Miami in July of that year.\nSince 1995, The Wolfsonian has exhibited both selections from the collection in permanent galleries as well as temporary exhibitions drawn from its collections and loaned from outside collections. As part of its commitment to support the arts, The Wolfsonian has also hosted temporary exhibitions of work by contemporary artists. It also maintains a teaching gallery at the Frost Art Museum on the Modesto Maidique Campus of FIU in western Miami, where FIU faculty often co-curate shows drawing on items in The Wolfsonian collections in conjunction with their classes. It regularly serves as a venue for community engagement with the arts, including children's programs, lectures and conferences, contemporary art shows, and musical performances. It offers fellowships for visiting scholars and researchers and actively supports the use of its collections by FIU classes.\n\nIn 2009, The Wolfsonian-FIU, which is located several miles away from FIU's two large campuses in western Miami and the northern end of Biscayne Bay, received a three-year grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to strengthen its ties with FIU faculty and staff; the Mellon Foundation awarded the museum another three-year grant beginning in 2012, to run through 2015. The museum has used the awards to expand its grant programs to faculty to incorporate the collections into their classes, provide fellowships for graduate students at FIU to research the collections for theses and dissertations and publications, hold scholarly conferences, host research fellows from outside FIU working on relevant topics to the collections, and expand opportunities for FIU faculty to help curate exhibitions from the museum's collections.\n\nIn 2012, The Wolfsonian completed a new strategic plan that would guide its next level of development, as it had successfully transitioned from a private collection to a reputable museum and research center. In recognition of its new plan and to encourage greater access to the collection, physically and online, it was awarded a $5 million grant from the John S and James L. Knight Foundation. This involves the renovation of the museum's main building on Washington Avenue and offsite storage in order to improve access to the collections by both FIU faculty and students and outside researchers. These changes are projected to take place over the next several years. It is expected that both the Mellon grants and the Knight grant will also facilitate the continued documentation of the collection and its dissemination in digital form online to an even broader public.\nMitchell Wolfson has continued to collect after donating a large portion of his holdings to The Wolfsonian. He maintains a separate but very similarly-themed private object and library collection in downtown Miami, known as the Mitchell Wolfson, Jr. Study and Research Centre, the contents of which will eventually be acquired by The Wolfsonian and integrated into its collections. The grants that The Wolfsonian has received recently are intended to help accommodate the absorption of these objects and printed materials over the next several years. Cathy Leff remained director of the museum until April 1, 2014.\n\nThe Wolfsonian was the first public building to have air conditioning installed.\n\nThe Wolfsonian is considered one of the seven campuses of FIU.\n\nIts facilities consist of the main building at 1001 Washington Avenue, the former Washington Storage Company building. The lower three floors of the structure were originally constructed by the architectural firm of Robertson & Patterson in the Spanish Renaissance style in 1926, then the popular choice for structures in South Florida, largely due to the region's long and well-known Spanish colonial heritage. Two floors were added by architect Robert M. Little in 1936. The building retained its five-floor configuration until 1986, when Mitchell Wolfson Jr. bought it.\n\nThe storage facility was designed with a tall ground floor space and large main entry to accommodate cars. It was envisioned that automobiles carrying large pieces of furniture would drive through the main gate into what is now the lobby, where their contents would be unloaded and placed in a freight elevator (the first in Miami Beach and still in operation) which would take the large items to the storage levels on the upper floors. There was no storage space on the ground floor in order to protect the items in storage from potential flooding during rainstorms and especially hurricanes. The building contains thick concrete walls in order to maintain a cool, constant temperature and to keep out humidity. It was principally used by wealthy northerners from New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and other major cities who maintained winter vacation homes in Miami and, before the days of air-conditioning, needed space to store their home furnishings during the summer to protect them from the hot and humid Florida weather.\n\nIn 1992, the structure was renovated and expanded to transform it into a combined museum and research center. Two more floors, the sixth and seventh levels, were added by Mark Hampton and William S. Kearns. The fifth floor was converted into permanent gallery space for The Wolfsonian's collections, while the sixth and seventh floors house temporary exhibitions. The fourth floor contains storage space for part of the object collections. The third floor contains the Wolfsonian's research library of some 60,000 items, including rare books and periodicals, pamphlets, and other printed materials and ephemera, including items as diverse as brochures, prints, timetables, advertising flyers, artist portfolios, calendars, and matchbook covers. The ground floor contains the lobby and museum café, bookstore and gift shop. Many parts of the building include permanent decorative and functional elements from the original Washington Storage Company, such as its doors to storage vaults, as well as items salvaged from other destroyed structures and reinstalled in the Wolfsonian.\n\nMost of the Wolfsonian's vast object collections of some 120,000 items are stored offsite in an old Bell Telephone building. The items housed there are currently only accessible to non-museum personnel by special request, though it is believed that the museum's long-term plans are to renovate its offsite storage to make these collections more available to FIU students, faculty, and outside researchers. It is possible that such renovations will include the addition of classroom space.\n\nThe Wolfsonian consists of two collections: its library collection, which consists of some 60,000 smaller-format works on paper, and the object collection, which includes all three-dimensional objects and large-format works on paper, such as posters, as well as a large collection of modern paintings. Most of the collections at The Wolfsonian were donated by Mitchell Wolfson, Jr., but the museum also holds large numbers of items acquired through other donations, purchases, and long-term loans.\n\nThe Wolfsonian library is non-circulating, but it is open regularly to researchers and scholars, though scheduling an appointment is necessary. Their holdings are entirely searchable through the catalog on The Wolfsonian's website. The object collections not on view are available by appointment only and subject to accessibility. Its holdings are only partially searchable online via the museum's collection of digital images. Contact with the museum staff is required to learn the full extent of what the object collection contains.\n\nThe flags that fly from poles above the main entrance on Washington Avenue are those of the countries most prominently represented in The Wolfsonian's collections.\n\nBetween them, the two collections' holdings can be divided into several principal areas:\n\n\nIn early 2006, the Wolfsonian-FIU opened a branch institution in Nervi, on the Italian Riviera. The sister museum is housed in a renovated school overlooking the sea, and is administered by the City of Genoa and the Region of Liguria. It features mainly Italian fine and decorative arts, design, and architecture.\n\nThe Wolfsonian has published catalogues of some of its exhibitions and parts of its collections, and there are plans to produce publications more frequently of future museum exhibitions. In addition, it is responsible for the publication of \"The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts\", which appears irregularly.\n\nSome of The Wolfsonian's exhibition publications include:\n\n\n\n"}

He appears in Arabic records as \"Fortoûn ibn Garsiya\" (\"فرتون بن غرسية\"). He was the eldest son of García Iñíguez and grandson of Íñigo Arista, the first king of Pamplona. Reigning for about thirty years, Fortún Garcés would be the last king of the Íñiguez dynasty.\n\nFortún was born at an unknown date, being the eldest son of García Íñiguez, king of Pamplona, and a woman named Urraca, who could have been the granddaughter of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi, the leader of the Banu Qasi clan. Little is known about his early life.\n\nKing García Íñiguez had worked towards a closer relationship with the Kingdom of Asturias, distancing himself and his kingdom from the Banu Qasi dynasty that ruled the lands near the Ebro river. He was involved in repeated armed conflicts with the Muslim forces of the Banu Qasi, and Muhammad I, emir of Córdoba, who invaded Pamplona in the year 860 and captured Fortún in Milagro, along with his daughter Onneca Fortúnez and took them hostages in Córdoba. The Wali of Zaragoza Muhammad ibn Lubb besieged and ultimately destroyed the castle of Aibar, resulting in the death of the king García Íñiguez. After the death of his father, Fortún Garcés was allowed to return to Pamplona to take his place as king. Fortún Garcés reigned with a policy very accommodating to the wishes of the Banu Qasi clan, which caused anger within the Pamplonese nobility. He would frequently retire to the Monastery of Leyre.\n\nA drastic change took place in 905, when Sancho Garcés was chosen by the Pamplonese nobility to replace Fortún Garcés as king. The reasons behind this decision reside in the fact that Sancho Garcés had a very well respected military prestige and had the support of important figures such as Raymond I, Count of Pallars and Ribagorza, Galindo Aznárez II, Count of Aragon and Alfonso III, King of Asturias.\n\nFortún Garcés permanently retired to the Monastery of Leyre in 905, where he died in 922.\n\nFortún was married to Auria, whose undocumented origin has been subject to conflicting speculation, to whom the Códice de Roda assigns the following children:\n\n\n"}

Created by Peter David and Bill Mumy, it premiered on March 2, 1996 and ended on January 27, 1997 with reruns until 1998. It aired for a time on Nickelodeon's Saturday night block of shows known as SNICK, and on Nickelodeon UK, with reruns on Family and TVOntario in Canada. An episode aired on TeenNick in the US as part of its \"The '90s Are All That\" block on the night of October 14, 2011 for the block's U Pick with Stick line-up, and again on December 27, 2011 for Party Like It's the '90s. Space Cases returned once again on the night of January 1, 2016 on TeenNick during the new The Splat programming block but has not aired since; the first four episodes of Season One were aired. The show's premise revolves around a group of misfit students and two adults who are stranded far from home aboard an alien ship. Their attempts at journeying back see many dangerous adventures and controversies, with some occasionally more mature themes.\n\nThe series was shot in Montreal, Quebec. Because of budget constraints, props from \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" and other Nickelodeon programs were used in the series. In other episodes, more mundane props were used, as in the episode \"Homeward Bound,\" the character Suzee is sitting in a chair with compact discs pasted to either side. During the first season, electronic games such as \"Lights Out\", were used as control panels on walls.\n\nSeason One's original theme song was orchestra-based, with an announcer voiceover giving a preamble. A vocal song telling the story of the Space Cases was used as the closing. For Season Two, this song was moved to the front and re-recorded to accommodate the removal of Catalina, the addition of Suzee, and some re-arranging to how the characters were presented. At some point after the series ended, Nickelodeon had the song re-recorded once more, using the same character arrangement as Season Two, but removing Suzee and adding Catalina back in, and created a new opening for the Season One episodes with this song.\n\nThe series features a multitude of celebrity guest stars throughout its run, including George Takei, Mark Hamill, Bill Mumy, Katey Sagal, Michelle Trachtenberg, Danny Tamberelli and Robin Leach.\n\n\n\nIn the first episode of the series, a small group of misfits are kept behind from a Space Academy field trip. Nearby, an odd bird-like alien ship appears, and Harlan Band decides to sneak onto it; the other students, all of whom are younger and much less troublesome, follow Harlan onto the ship. During their exploration of the ship's interior, the organic ship bonds to each student when each touches a bulkhead.\n\nTJ Davenport, their teacher and principal, and Commander Seth Goddard go after them and, in a series of unfortunate events, become separated throughout the vessel. One of the students accidentally charges the engines, hurtling the ship off into a spatial rift. By the time everyone figures out that only the children who bonded to the ship can actually control it, the ship has stopped several light years away from the Academy. They set off on a return trip which would take them at least seven years, four months, and twenty-two days at maximum speeds.\n\n"}

He played for the Birmingham Barons in 1917 and part of 1918, when he made the Pittsburgh Pirates and played in 64 major league games.\n\nSouthworth played more regularly in 1919, appearing in 121 games and leading the league with 14 triples. With the exception of two seasons, Southworth played in at least that many games through 1926. In 1926, Southworth's offensive production increased and he finished the season with a .320 batting average, 16 home runs and 99 RBI. He ran into difficulty with New York manager John McGraw that year, as Southworth's independent style became incompatible with McGraw's strict leadership. He was traded from the New York Giants to the St. Louis Cardinals in the middle of the season. Southworth suffered a 1927 rib injury that limited his playing time. The Cardinals' leadership began to look for a role for Southworth beyond his playing career.\n\nSouthworth's managerial career began in 1928 with the Rochester Red Wings of the AA International League (IL), the top club in the Cardinals' farm system. In May, Southworth and his wife experienced the stillbirths of twins. Southworth returned home after losing the twins, but he quickly came back to Rochester. Late in the season, Southworth received word that Billy Jr. had been accidentally shot by a neighbor in Columbus. His son recovered, but the experience shook the manager. The team won the IL championship that season.\n\nSouthworth was promoted to St. Louis as player-manager for , replacing Bill McKechnie, who won a National League pennant in 1928 and lost the World Series in four straight games to the New York Yankees. Southworth's Major League playing career reached the end of the road, as he appeared in only 19 games, five in the outfield, and batted only .188 with six hits. He finished with a .297 batting average in 1,192 MLB games played, 52 home runs, 91 triples, 173 doubles, 661 runs scored, and 561 RBI. He stole 138 bases in his career and had double-digit steal totals in eight seasons. As a big leaguer, Southworth had 1,296 hits in 4,359 at bats.\n\nHis 1929 MLB managerial debut was not much more successful than his playing stint. Only one year removed from being a teammate of his charges, he attempted to impose discipline on the Cardinals, banning them from driving their own automobiles. The team did not respond to his hard line and won only 43 of their first 88 games. Southworth was sent back to Rochester on July 21, McKechnie was rehired, and the Cardinals finished in fourth place.\n\nAlthough Southworth immediately resumed his successful minor league managerial career, the firing and personal tragedy — the death of his wife Lida at age 42 — began a downward spiral. Beset by struggles with alcoholism, he quit a coaching job with the 1933 Giants during spring training and left baseball for two seasons. After a recovery, he rejoined the Cardinals' minor league system in 1935 and by 1939 he was again enjoying success as Rochester's manager. He remarried in 1935, wedding the former Mabel Stemen, with whom he had a daughter.\n\nIn June , he received a second chance with the struggling Cardinals when owner Sam Breadon fired manager Ray Blades and promoted Southworth from Rochester. This time, the Cards flourished under him. With talented players such as Enos Slaughter, Marty Marion, Stan Musial, Walker Cooper, Mort Cooper, Whitey Kurowski and Johnny Beazley being harvested each spring from the club's farm system, the Cardinals entered a Golden Age in their history. Upon Southworth's appointment, they won 69 of 109 games and jumped from seventh to third place in 1940. The following season they won 97 games and finished second.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944, the Cardinals won 106, 105 and 105 games, three pennants and two World Series titles. His 1942 Cardinals, who breezed to the World Series championship in five games, were the only team (out of eight) to ever defeat Joe McCarthy's New York Yankees in a Fall Classic. In 1943, both teams met again in the World Series; but this time, the Yankees turned the tables on the Redbirds, winning in five games. The Cards' third successive National League pennant, in , produced another world championship, a six-game triumph over the American League (AL) St. Louis Browns. With it, Southworth had presided over one of the most dominant three-year stretches in National League (NL) history.\n\nHowever, another personal family tragedy struck when on February 15, 1945, his son, Billy Jr., by then a United States Army Air Forces major, died when his Boeing B-29 Superfortress crashed into Flushing Bay, New York after taking off from Mitchel Field, New York, on a training flight to Florida.\n\nStill, Southworth began managing at the beginning of the season, which saw his Cardinals win 95 games but finished second, three games behind the Chicago Cubs.\n\nSouthworth moved to the Boston Braves in , signing a then-lucrative managing contract for a reported $50,000 per season, and immediately led the Braves into the first division. Talented pitchers Johnny Sain and Warren Spahn had both returned from service in World War II that year.\n\nIn , the Braves won their second NL pennant of the 20th century—and Boston's last National League title—but were defeated in six games by the Cleveland Indians in the 1948 World Series. In that World Series, all of the games were close except for one, when the Braves beat pitcher Bob Feller 11–5. Author John Rossi writes that Sain lost some respect for Southworth after the manager said the managing and not talent had won the 1948 pennant. Sain had already become irritated with Southworth after the 1948 signing of unproven \"bonus baby\" pitcher Johnny Antonelli. Sain and Southworth rarely spoke after 1948.\n\nDuring the following season, 1949, Boston struggled on the field and was in chaos off the diamond. Southworth was rumored to be drinking heavily and near nervous collapse. Some players complained about his rules and regulations, and some, including starting shortstop Alvin Dark and second baseman Eddie Stanky, were critical of his drinking. Meanwhile, others, like Sain, resented the amount of credit Southworth had received for the 1948 pennant. With Boston at 55–54 on August 16, Southworth turned the Braves over to coach Johnny Cooney for the remainder of . A newspaper account at the time characterized the change as a leave of absence for health reasons.\n\nAfter some of the rebellious players (including Dark and Stanky) had been traded, Southworth returned to his post in and led the Braves back into the first division, but an aging team and declining attendance boded poorly for both Southworth's career and the Braves' future in New England. In , Southworth's club was only 28–31 on June 19. He called the team's general manager, John Quinn, and asked to be allowed to resign, and he was replaced by his former standout right fielder, Tommy Holmes.\n\nSouthworth's major league managerial win-loss record was 1,044–704. His .597 winning percentage is second all-time among managers to McCarthy's .615. Southworth was the first to win the World Series as a player and again as a manager.\n\nSouthworth remained with the Braves as a scout in the 1950s. He was acquitted of drunken driving charges after a 1955 arrest, and retired from scouting at the end of his contract following the 1956 season. During his scouting days, he signed future all-time home run leader Hank Aaron, who was playing for the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro Leagues.\n\nFor the last couple of decades of his life, Southworth lived outside of Sunbury, Ohio. By the summer of 1969, his health had begun to fail and he was confined to his home. He gave a final interview to a reporter for the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"; he commented on how difficult it would be for the 1969 Cardinals to win a third straight championship, as the 1944 team had done. Though he had quit smoking many years earlier, Southworth died of emphysema that year in Columbus, Ohio, and was buried in Green Lawn Cemetery.\n\nSouthworth's cousin, Bill Southworth, appeared in the major leagues in 1964.\n\nSouthworth was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. He had been eligible for election as a player in the 1940s, but he received few votes. After Southworth had been left off of the ballot as a manager in 2003, author Raymond Mileur had begun a campaign of letter writing, phone calls to the Hall of Fame, radio show comments and advocacy through his website known as \"The Birdhouse\". Southworth was elected after receiving 13 votes from the 16-member Veterans Committee.\n\nOn the occasion of Southworth's election to the Hall of Fame, one of his former players on the 1948 Braves, Clint Conatser, paid tribute to his old manager. \"He just had a gut feeling about the right thing to do in a situation\", Conatser recalled. \"The moves he would make would work for him — all the time, not occasionally. Leo Durocher was the same way. It's like some guys can pick horses out of nowhere. Southworth was a genius like that on the diamond.\"\n\nIn January 2014, the Cardinals announced that Southworth was among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014. He is also a member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

The field is approximately south of Pinedale and north of Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming, and is estimated to contain of natural gas. Managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the field has a productive area of .\n\nThe presence of natural gas in and around Sublette County was known for years, but it was not deemed practical to extract. El Paso Natural Gas Company in the 1970s, in cooperation with Federal Government of the United States and the Atomic Energy Commission, proposed a project called Wagon Wheel Nuclear Stimulation Project, which was an attempt to detonate 5 small nuclear explosions to fracture the sands and enable natural-gas production. The project was abandoned and the Jonah Field and surrounding areas, including the Pinedale Anticline, were left undeveloped for years.\n\nJonah Field was discovered by geologist Ed Warner working with McMurry Oil, Ft. Collins Consodiated Royalties and Nerd Enterprises. The field proved viable after the drilling of the McMurry Oil Company Jonah-Federal #1-5 in January, 1993 where McMurry placed their operations office.\n\nThe development of Jonah was enabled by new approaches to the geology and engineering. The McMurry group with the help of their engineering consultant, James Shaw, experimented with energized and multiple stage fracture treatments, revolutionizing gas development where 2,500 feet of section was treated (instead of only 250 feet) and wells were drilled on very close spacing - as little as 10 acre centers. The 'Basin-centered' geology model was radically changed by Warner to the 'Compartmentalization model' which enabled the entire field to be developed with virtually no dry holes, a cost savings of several hundred millions of dollars. \nCitations:\nWarner, Edward M., 2000, Structural Geology and Pressure Compartmentalization of Jonah Field Based on\n__, 2002, A Short History of Jonah Field: From Technology to Geology; 2002 AAPG National \n\nJonah Field is known for being one of the largest on-shore natural gas discoveries in the USA in the early 1990s. The startling fact is that Jonah has a surface area of approximately one township yet it contains of gas. In comparison, the Hugoton Field covers most of the southwest portion of Kansas, a 14 county area, yet it contained only about three times the volume of gas in Jonah.\n\nThe principal technical challenge in Jonah was the identification and stimulation of productive intervals in a to section of stacked lenticular fluvial sand/silt/shale sequences which comprise the Upper Mesaverde, Lance, and Unnamed Tertiary formations. Previous attempts to fracture treat Lance sandstones in the Jonah and Pinedale Fields areas had all ended in failure. The McMurry group used new energized foam fracture technology and then went on to successfully stack fracture treatments, one after another. This revolutionary approach increased per well reserves from 1.5 BCF to 6.5 BCF. \n\nThe original Jonah partners (see History), due to a lack of interest from Northwest Pipeline, were forced to form Johah Gas Gathering, LLC. They found new ways of inexpensively building pipelines using a proprietary engineering system called Zaplocking. The entire initial out-of-pocket expense for the pipeline system was about $150,000. Today the system is worth an estimated $4 billion. All the Jonah partners sold out to EnCana Oil and Gas in April 2000 except Warner who held on until gas went from $2/mcf to $12/mcf. Warner sold out to the Williams Company in December, 2000.\n\nThe principal gas companies currently developing the field are the EnCana Corporation and Linn Energy. Other active gas companies involved in the Jonah Field include Ultra Petroleum, Yates Petroleum and Hogshead Spouter.\n\nOther large natural gas fields in and around Sublette County, Wyoming include the Pinedale Anticline, the Wamsutter gas field, and several sour gas H2S fields operated by ExxonMobil.\n\n"}

It is sometimes included in \"Anas\", but it belongs to a South American clade that diverged early in dabbling duck evolution. There are two subspecies: \"L. specularioides alticola\" (Andean crested duck) and \"L. specularioides specularioides\" (Patagonian crested duck). The Patagonian crested duck is also called the southern crested duck and its range lies in the Falklands, Chile, and Argentina.\nThe crested duck is a medium-sized waterfowl species, with adult males reaching up to just over a kilogram. Males and females look similar, with males having a slightly more prominent crest than females. The feathers of the mantle, back and scapulars are dark brown with pale centers, giving a mottled appearance. The abdomen, flanks and tail coverts are light gray, with the tail itself being distinctly elongated and black. The upperwing is gray brown to light brown, with the secondaries having an iridescent coppery to greenish sheen, with a broad back band behind, narrowly edged with white. Juveniles are similar but lack crests, have light brown faces, and paler abdomens than adults.\n\nCrested ducks are endemic to South America. The two subspecies occupy different elevations in the Andes, with \"Lophonetta s. alticola\" occurring from 2500-4800m from Peru to central Chile and \"Lophonetta s. specularioides\" occurring below 1500m in the southern Andes near Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. The two subspecies co-occur in a zone of intermediate elevational habitats in Mendoza, Argentina and Talca, Chile.\n\nThe crested duck is found in lakes, marshes, and grassy areas from shallow coastal bays to high elevation lakes. In the Altiplano, they gather in turbid, alkaline lakes with large concentrations of zooplankton. They reside in sheltered bays and on beaches along the coast, where they forage for clams and other marine amphipods among rocks and kelp beds \n\nCrested ducks are non-gregarious, flocking only in areas of unusually high food supplies. Generally pairs will expel others of their own species as well as alien species from their foraging areas. For these reasons they are considered highly territorial \n\nNesting birds are found almost throughout the year, depending on location within the range of crested duck. In the high elevations of the Andes, active nests can be found throughout the summer from October to April. The season is shorter in Patagonia and the Falklands, with nests found from September to January. Two broods per year are common, but three may occur as well.\n\nNests are on the ground, close to water and usually built among grass or ferns for reduced visibility. Eggs are cream colored, and a clutch may have from five to eight eggs. The incubation period lasts about 30 days. Only the female incubates the eggs, but males play an important role in the ducklings early development. Crested Ducks are monogamous and mating pairs exhibit high levels of cooperation which allow the species to live in proximity to other species such as gulls and skuas.\n\nCrested ducks are dabbling ducks, which means they sieve through mud, silt, or gravel to find macroinvertebrates. Their diet, which is highly dependent on habitat, ranges from zooplankton, clams, kelp, and other macroinvertebrates.\n\nCrested duck is one of the most common duck species in the Tierra del Fuego and has been evaluated as Least Concern \n\n"}

It is the second largest city in the Moquegua Region and capital of the Ilo Province.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the area was populated by the people of the Chiribaya culture. The Conquistadores were given land grants by Charles V and brought olives to this area. Olive agriculture was the main crop and source of work until the early 20th century. A small settlement, Pacocha, was established by the seashore where the Osmore River (Rio Osmore) flows into the Pacific Ocean. High tides in the late 19th century flooded Pacocha and the population moved to Ilo's actual location, adopting its current name. Until the beginning of the 20th century most of the people lived along the banks of the Rio Osmore, whose waters flow sporadically during the summer months. Ilo was a port of call to the ships travelling from the east to the west coast of the United States via Tierra del Fuego. After the building of a pier in the 19th century, international trade flourished in the region. Italians, Chinese, Japanese and Germans settled in Ilo during this time. However, the building of the Transcontinental Rail Road and the Panama Canal caused commercial activities to decrease and mostly steamships transporting goods between Peruvian and Chilean ports remained. The Battle of Pacocha took place near Ilo.\n\nAlong with its pier, a railroad was built to connect Ilo to Moquegua. The railroad was named after Calamazo (Spanish pronunciation of Kalamazoo, from the name stamped on the equipment used by the railroad). The main economic activities of the city include fishing and mining. Copper mines originally owned by the Southern Peru Copper Corporation (SPCC) have provided several jobs to the region. SPCC was established by the American Smelting and Mining Corporation in the middle of the 20th century. Many Americans and Peruvians working for SPCC live in an area of Ilo called Ciudad Nueva. The copper smelting plant and a formerly state-owned refinery located 10 kilometers far from the city have contributed to a large amount of air and water pollution in the region. Ilo's industry appeared in the Canadian documentary film \"The Corporation\", as an example of environmental problems caused by industries. Local swimming areas include Pozo de Lisas, Monte Carlo and Puerto Ingles. Bolivia has in the past utilized Ilo as a free gate to the ocean for both recreational and trade purposes.\n\nThe Peruvian government has granted a 99-year lease to the government of landlocked Bolivia to develop a port facility, in effect allowing Bolivia to claim to be a \"Pacific Ocean nation\". Bolivia lost an earlier claim to a portion of Pacific coast after going to war with Chile in the 19th century. A new railway through Bolivia to Brazil is also proposed.\n\nTemperatures in Ilo range between 18 and 28 degrees Celsius year round. Rain is almost non-existent, as Ilo is located north of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest coastal deserts in the world.\n\nIlo is the southernmost of the three ports which comprise the Peruvian termini of the Interoceanic Highway which is being constructed to link the state of Acre, in the Amazon Basin in Brazil, across the Andes to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe main attraction is the Urban Center whose landmarks are:\n\n\nBoliviaMar is a narrow strip of beach located 17.5 km to the south, next to the coastal road that connects the departments of Tacna and Moquegua. It is a port concession to Bolivia and the terminus for a planned railway project.\n\nIlo is referenced in the traditional sea shanty \"Tom's Gone to Hilo\". \n\n\n"}

He has been an active participant with the STAR (Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC) Experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the particle accelerator at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nJohn Cramer was born in Houston, Texas. He attended Mirabeau B Lamar High School in Houston, and graduated with a BA in Physics from Rice University in 1957. He continued his studies, graduating with an MA in Physics from Rice University in 1959 and a Ph.D. in Physics from Rice University in 1961.\n\nAfter serving as a post-doctoral fellow at Indiana University from 1961–63, Cramer continued as an assistant professor at the same university from 1963-64. He was an assistant professor at the University of Washington from 1964–68, an associate professor from 1968–74, and was appointed as a full professor in 1974.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2014, Cramer investigated the possibility that quantum nonlocality might be used for communication between observers through the use of switchable interference patterns. In the course of this work, he gained new understanding of the \"show stopper\" within the quantum formalism that prevents such nonlocal signaling: For each interference pattern, nature also provides and superimposes an \"anti-interference pattern\". These are always combined in a way that \"erases\" potential nonlocal signals. The two interference patterns complement each other, resulting in no perceptible interference pattern. Measurement changes can dramatically modify the individual interference patterns, but always so that this erasure occurs. In this way, nature is protected from the possibility of retrocausal signaling and its consequences and paradoxes.\n\nCramer makes regular appearances on the Science Channel and on NPR Science Friday.\n\nIn addition to his approximately 300 scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals, John Cramer writes a regular column, \"The Alternate View\", appearing in every second issue, for \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\" magazine. He also originated and published a paper on \"The Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\" (TIQM) in July 1986, which was inspired from the Wheeler-Feynman Time-symmetric theory.\n\nHis book on quantum mechanics, \"The Quantum Handshake: Entanglement, Nonlocality and Transactions\" (2015), published by Springer Verlag, is a comprehensive introduction to the transactional interpretation.\n\nCramer's simulation of the sound of the Big Bang, created using Mathematica, attracted some mainstream press attention in late 2003 and again in 2013. The simulation originated with an \"Alternate View\" article, \"BOOMERanG and the Sound of the Big Bang\" (January 2001). Cramer describes the sound as \"rather like a large jet plane 100 feet off the ground flying over your house in the middle of the night.\"\n\nCramer has published two novels, \"Twistor\" (1989) and \"Einstein's Bridge\" (1997), both within the hard science fiction genre. Cramer was the 2010 Science Guest of Honor at Norwescon, a large science fiction and fantasy convention in the Seattle area.\n\nSee also AV Columns Online\n\n\n\nCramer married Pauline Ruth Bond in June, 1961.

Population: 221,085 (2010 Census results); It is called Stary Oskol (Old Oskol) to distinguish it from Novy Oskol (New Oskol) 60km south. Both are on the Oskol River.\n\nIt was near the Muravsky Trail used by Crimeans and Nogais to raid Muscovy. In 1571 a fort was built nearby. It was abandoned after 15 years, but the area was still patrolled. In 1593 Oskol was refounded as a fortress. In 1617 it was burned by the Poles. The surrounding area was frequently raided by the Tatars. In 1655 it was renamed Stary Oskol to distinguish it from the new fort at Novy Oskol. Later it was affected by the Russian Civil War in 1919, as well as by World War II, where it was captured by Hungarian troops. After World War II, industry developed in the city and its population started to grow.\n\nAccurately confirmed information about the meaning of the word Oskol does not exist today, but there are many hypotheses and assumptions. At present, two hypotheses are widespread.\n\nCandidate of Historical Sciences, Anatoly Pavlovich Nikulov believes that the word “Oskol” is of Turkic origin, since the lands of modern Stary Oskol in the early Middle Ages were part of the Khazar Kaganate, being in constant proximity to the lands inhabited by ancient Slavic tribes. At the same time it was proved that the settlements appeared in the V century AD. er and the main occupation of the population was the mining of iron ores and the smelting of metal. Then these lands in the 9th — 10th centuries became part of Kievan Rus and remained frontier for two states, then the so-called “Wild Field”.\n\nAccording to the second, the word \"Oskol\" can be divided into two: \"Os\" and \"Kol\". The first \"Os\" means Rus, the Russians, since it is known that in the 7th-8th centuries in Byzantium the people living in the northern Black Sea region were called the people of Ros and the Arabs took this word to their arsenal. But in the Turkic languages there is no clear pronunciation of the sound “R”, and it is replaced by a softening of the next sound, so instead of a clear “Ros” there was a softened “Os”. The word “Kol” in Turkic languages means “pond”, “lake” or “river”.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Stary Oskol serves as the administrative center of Starooskolsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated of Microsoft separately as the town of oblast significance of Stary Oskol—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the territories of the city of oblast significance of Stary Oskol and of Starooskolsky District are incorporated as Starooskolsky Urban Okrug.\n\nStary Oskol is an important center of iron ore mining, situated at the border of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly, one of the largest deposits of iron ore worldwide. Over eight million tons of iron ore are mined here per year. For this reason there is also a branch of the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys in the city.\n\nOne of the oldest kids music schools in the city is located in the city center, on Lenina Street.\n\n\nStary Oskol is twinned with:\n\n"}

Rose was nicknamed \"Australia's Michael Jordan\" due to his clutch shooting and defensive abilities.\n\nRose played collegiately for the George Mason Patriots from 1982 to 1986. During his senior season, he led the Patriots to their first National Invitational Tournament (NIT). Rose was a second-team All-ECAC South selection in 1985 and a first-team All-CAA selection in 1986. He ranks in the top 10 of points (9th), rebounds (9th), steals (3rd), blocks (6th), field goal percentage (4th), free throw percentage (8th) and free throws made (9th) in Patriots program history.\n\nRose played 2 games in the NBA for the Los Angeles Clippers in the 1988-89 season after signing a 10-day contract. He played just 3 minutes. He later played in the Philippine Basketball Association for the Purefoods Hotdogs in the 1990 Reinforced Conference and helped the team win their first ever championship despite getting injured in the final game. He began his NBL career in 1992 with the South-East Melbourne Magic, leading his team to the championship - which would prove to be his only one. The next year Rose would average 18.6 points, 7.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game on his way to the National Basketball League MVP.\n\nRose signed to play with the Adelaide 36ers for the 1994 NBL season under a new 36ers coach, former NCAA coach Mike Dunlap. Rose combined with Mark Davis, Mike McKay, Phil Smyth and Brett Maher to lead the team to the 1994 NBL Grand Final Series where they were defeated by the North Melbourne Giants in two games (Rose averaged 32 points for the series), as well as the 1995 Semi-Finals against the Perth Wildcats. During his time in Adelaide Rose won the club's 1994 and 1995 MVP awards and was selected to the 1995 NBL All-Star Game played at Adelaide's Clipsal Powerhouse, where he won the game MVP award.\n\nRose then signed for a three-year stint with the Canberra Cannons where it appeared that his career was somewhat diminishing, although his spectacular stats would not suggest such a thing. Indeed, he was selected to the All NBL First Team in both 1996 and 1997 while in Canberra. After not enjoying any post season success with the Cannons he signed with the struggling North Queensland team of the Townsville Crocodiles. Rose would turn the franchise around captaining them to the semi-finals and grand final in the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 seasons. Rose capped off his team's performance by winning his second league MVP award. However the Crocodiles would be defeated by the Wollongong Hawks in the deciding game three of the grand final series.\n\nAfter the 2005-06 season, at age 42, the Crocodiles decided not to renew Rose's contract.

Her film roles include Tina Tech in \"Flashdance\" (1983), Jackie in \"Staying Alive\" (1983), Penny in \"Dirty Dancing\" (1987) and \"Runaway\" as Thompson.\n\nBorn in Nashville, Tennessee, Rhodes began her show-business career working at Opryland USA as a singer and dancer while attending Glencliff High School during the 1970s. Raised in a Baptist family, Rhodes tried to maintain a clean-cut image in her acting roles and in the media, turning down scripts that required nudity and refusing offers to pose for pictorials in \"Playboy\" magazine. Sylvester Stallone, the director of \"Staying Alive\", reinforced these facts by stating that Rhodes \"would sooner quit the business before doing anything to embarrass her parents.\"\n\nRhodes played a small role in the fantasy musical \"Xanadu\" (1980). Her next role was as Tina Tech in the musical film \"Flashdance\". After Flashdance, Rhodes was cast opposite John Travolta in Sylvester Stallone's 1983 film \"Staying Alive\", a sequel to the 1977 hit film \"Saturday Night Fever\". Rhodes' character, Jackie, was an ensemble dancer, bar band singer, and sometime love interest of Travolta's character, Tony Manero. While poorly reviewed, the film was commercially successful.\n\nRhodes garnered her first non-dance related role in Michael Crichton's 1984 science fiction thriller \"Runaway\" with Tom Selleck, Kirstie Alley and Gene Simmons. Her most notable role was as dance instructor Penny Johnson in the hit 1987 motion picture \"Dirty Dancing\" with Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze. Rhodes' final motion picture role was the character of Vickie Phillips, playing opposite Jameson Parker, in the sleeper action-adventure movie \"Curse of the Crystal Eye\".\n\nRhodes also appeared as a dancer in a number of music videos, including \"Rosanna\" by the band Toto, \"The Woman in You\" by the Bee Gees, and \"Don't Mean Nothing\" by Richard Marx. She was a dancer for the glam rock band The Tubes when they toured in the early 1980s. Rhodes later joined the pop group Animotion, replacing their lead singer Astrid Plane, for the recording of their third album of original material. Though the group's single \"Room to Move\" (from the film \"My Stepmother Is an Alien\") rose to  9 on the Billboard charts, the album failed to match the group's earlier success, peaking at only No. 110 on the pop charts; shortly thereafter, the group disbanded. In 2002, Rhodes co-wrote the smooth jazz track \"Perfect Day\" with then-husband Richard Marx for \"December\", trumpeter Chris Botti's holiday album.\n\nRhodes was married to singer-songwriter Richard Marx. They met in 1983 while Marx was working on the motion picture soundtrack for \"Staying Alive\". Rhodes, seven years his senior, thought Marx was much too young for her to date at the time. Marx and Rhodes did not start their relationship until two years later, when they were reacquainted at a party. After a four-year courtship, the couple married on January 8, 1989. After marrying Marx and giving birth to three boys, Rhodes retired from her performing career to raise her family. In an \"Us Weekly\" article dated April 4, 2014, Marx's representative confirmed that he and Rhodes were divorcing after 25 years of marriage.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Íñigo Arista, the first king of Pamplona. Educated in Cordoba, he was a successful military leader who led the military campaigns of the kingdom during the last years of his father's life.\n\nEducated in Córdoba, as a guest at the court of the Emir of Córdoba, García was the son of Íñigo Arista, the first king of a Basque dynasty ruling in Pamplona up to the late 9th century. When his father was stricken by paralysis in 842, he became regent of the kingdom (or perhaps co-regent with his uncle Fortún Íñiguez). He and his kinsman Mūsā ibn Mūsā ibn Fortún of the Banu Qasi rebelled against the Cordoban emir in 843. This rebellion was put down by Emir Abd ar-Rahman II, who attacked the Kingdom of Pamplona, defeating García badly and killing Fortún. At his father's death in 851/2 (237 A.H.), he succeeded to the crown of Pamplona.\n\nFollowing the death of Íñigo Arista, the Banu Qasi leader Mūsā ibn Mūsā pursued a policy of closer allegiance with Muhammad I of Córdoba, leaving García to look to Christian Asturias for an ally. In 859, the Vikings captured King Garcia Iñiguez, probably far removed from his Basque kingdom of Navarre, somewhere in the Andalusian heartland, and extorted a hefty ransom, rising to around 70,000 gold dinars. Later the same year, Mūsā ibn Mūsā attacked the Pamplonese city of Albelda. García and his new friend Ordoño I of Asturias together dealt Mūsā a crushing blow, killing, it is said, 10,000 of his magnates in the Battle of Albelda. This, in turn, provoked a raid by Mohammed I of Córdoba in response and the next year, 860, saw García's son and heir Fortún captured and imprisoned by Mohammed I of Córdoba.\n\nHe languished in Córdoba for the next 20 years. In 870, García formed an alliance with the Muslim rebel Amrūs ibn Umar ibn Amrūs, who had killed Garcia's nephew Mūsā ibn Galindo of Huesca, and the next year was apparently in a new alliance with the sons of Mūsā ibn Mūsā, now in rebellion against Córdoba.\n\nGarcía's death has been subject to scholarly dispute, a result of a paucity of records from the last years of his reign. The lack of subsequent mention of him after 870 led to the suggestion that he died in that year, and as his heir was in the hands of his enemies, it was argued that García Jiménez then governed the kingdom as regent. García's son, Fortún Garcés, is then made to succeed upon his release in 880. There is, however, no evidence for such a regency, and Sanchéz Albornoz has cited evidence that García was still living at the time of his son's return. Thus it is likely that Balparda was reporting an accurate tradition when he suggested García and ally Umar ibn Hafsun fought a battle at Aibar, nor far from present-day Lumbier, against the troops of the Emir of Córdoba in 882, García dying there (although the age provided him, 84 years, is clearly exaggerated).\n\nThe identity of García's wife or wives is poorly documented, and has been subject to much speculation. An undated confirmation of an earlier lost charter refers to King García and Queen Urraca Mayor, and this is thought by some to refer to García Íñiguez and an otherwise unknown wife, Urraca. Based on her name alone and the fact that one of his sons' names was Fortún, a common name among the Banu Qasi dynasty, it has been argued that Urraca could have been a granddaughter of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi, the leader of the Banu Qasi clan. Other historians have suggested alternative parentage, or suggested the document does not refer to García Íñiguez at all but instead to García Sánchez II of Pamplona and his mother Queen Urraca Fernández. A second possible wife is \"infanta\" Leodegundia, daughter of Ordoño I of Asturias. She is known to have married a ruler of Pamplona not named in the primary source, and García Íñiguez is one of those speculated to have been this prince.\n\n\nHe may also have been the father of Jimena, who married King Alfonso III of Asturias between 26 May and 20 December 873, both appearing together for first time in 874 making a donation to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Her name and the status of her husband as the premier monarch in Christian Iberia suggests that she could have come from nothing short of the highest levels of Pamplona society, though some have instead derived her from the Jimenez dynasty.\n\n"}

The self-produced album was created as a tribute to her father, and counterpart to her brother Mark Z. Danielewski's novel \"House of Leaves\".\n\nIn April 2019, eOne Music released \"Haunted\" on vinyl for the first time as an exclusive through Books-A-Million.\n\n\"Haunted\" found Poe combining traditional pop notions with electronic, dance and hard rock music. The album was a critical success. The song \"Hey Pretty\" was released as a promo single, but Poe's vocals had been replaced with a chapter reading from her brother . It reached  13 on Billboard's US Modern Rock chart. \"Wild\" was planned as a third single, garnering some radio play in the Chicago area after a promotional edit was released. The single was never released commercially, but featured a shorter radio mix in addition to an acoustic/rock version of the song. The title track was used as the first song for ending credits to the film \"\".\n\n\"Haunted\" was also referenced in the 2002 film \"Panic Room\". In a conversation between Jodie Foster's character and the agent selling the home containing the panic room, Sarah Altman asks \"Ever read any Poe?\", to which the response given is \"No, but I loved her last album!\".\n\nThe song \"Haunted\" was also featured at the end of the second episode of the video game \"Alan Wake\" for Xbox 360, as well as the Tai Chi Warmup in the Les Mills BodyBalance/BodyFlow program release number 54.\n\nThe album also featured samples of audio recordings made by Poe's father, film director Tad Danielewski. The cassettes were found by Poe and Mark after their father had died and were literally audio-letters to the two of them that spanned back as far as their birth. Thus, the album is usually interpreted as a real woman (Poe) singing tributes to her deceased father (who sings back) even while telling the story of a group of fictional characters (from \"House of Leaves\").\n\n\"Haunted\" received generally positive reviews. On Metacritic, the album has a score of 76 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nMacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, writing \"\"Haunted\" is in its own class of twisted intelligence and beauty.\" In another positive review, PopMatters's Eden Miller wrote \"Few musicians are on the same level as Poe in terms of her bravery exposing and expressing her own personal fears. While it's a bit obvious to say it, \"Haunted\" will haunt you.\" In another positive review, Jason Mandell of \"LA Weekly\" wrote \"Those without patience for such abstractions (brief though they may be) may find \"Haunted\" tiresome. The rest of us can rejoice in its originality and thank our lucky stars that Poe had the confidence and imagination to make it.\"\n\nIn a mixed review, \"Rolling Stone\"s Neva Chonin wrote \"Unfortunately, \"Haunted\" reverberates with tired samples, rehashed echo effects and beats so plodding they could stop a metronome.\" \"Q\" also gave the album a mixed review, writing \"The mood is too heavy for far too long, but some good songs and more cohesive, melodic structures augur well for this damaged daughter's future.\"\n\n\n\nAlbum – \"Billboard\" (US)\nSingles – \"Billboard\" (US)\n"}

He became known as the lead guitarist of the Boston rock band Extreme. He has also recorded a solo album as well as having founded bands including Mourning Widows, Population 1, DramaGods, The Satellite Party (headed by Jane's Addiction's then-former frontman and Lollapalooza co-founder Perry Farrell). In 2007 he also reunited with Extreme to record new music and tour.\n\nBettencourt was born on September 20, 1966 in Praia da Vitória, Terceira, Azores, Portugal, to Ezequiel Mendes Bettencourt and wife Aureolina da Cunha Gil de Ávila. When he was four years old, his family, including brothers Luís and Roberto, moved to Hudson, Massachusetts. Bettencourt lived on Main Street in Hudson for twenty-one years. Initially, Bettencourt had little interest in music, wanting to become an actor and preferring to spend his time playing hockey and football. His first instrument was the drums and he played them exclusively until his brother, Luís, started teaching him the guitar.\n\nWhile Bettencourt was slow to adopt the instrument under his brother's tutelage, his skills quickly developed when he began teaching himself, and he has mentioned in many interviews that he would skip many school days to practice upwards of seven hours a day. In his sophomore and junior years of high school, Bettencourt dropped out of sports so he could focus on playing guitar. He eventually dropped out of high school altogether, for the same reason.\n\nAs a guitarist, one of Bettencourt's earliest influences was Eddie Van Halen. However, as he developed his craft as a guitarist and a songwriter, his influences expanded to embrace the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Prince, Queen (Brian May), Pat Travers, Paco de Lucía, Al Di Meola and Kayak.\n\nUnable to make a dent in the music world with his Boston-based hair-metal act Sinful, Bettencourt rose to international prominence as a guitar player after he joined the Boston-area group Extreme in 1985. Signed to A&M Records shortly after Bettencourt joined the group, the band released its debut record, \"Extreme\", in 1989. He then provided rhythm guitar on the single version of Janet Jackson's \"Black Cat,\" which became a number one hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nIn 1990, Extreme released their most critically acclaimed album, \"Pornograffitti\", which included the hits \"More Than Words\" and \"Hole Hearted\". The album also has one of Bettencourt's most impressive guitar solos to date, The \"Flight of the Wounded Bumblebee\"—an interpretation of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Flight of the Bumblebee\"—as the intro guitar solo to the track \"He-Man Woman Hater\". \"Pornograffitti\" garnered admiration for Bettencourt from rock guitar enthusiasts. He was voted \"Best New Talent\" in a 1991 readers' poll by \"Guitar World\" magazine, and that magazine later named him \"Most Valuable Player\" of 1991.\n\nThe band followed up with \"III Sides to Every Story\" in 1992. Bettencourt composed and arranged the brass and string sections for this album and the full orchestra on the album.\n\nIn 1995, Extreme released the album \"Waiting for the Punchline\", but the band broke up in 1996 when Bettencourt expressed his desire to follow a solo career. Shortly after, singer Gary Cherone went on to become the lead singer of Van Halen.\n\nIn 2007, the band reformed with the original line up (with the exception of Paul Geary) to begin work on a new album, \"Saudades de Rock\", released on August 12, 2008, and subsequent tour.\n\nIn 1997, Bettencourt released his first solo effort, \"Schizophonic\", which he had been working on for five years. The album was well-received critically, but was not a commercial success.\n\nOn December 16, 1997, Bettencourt's new band Mourning Widows (whose name was inspired by writing he had seen on a church wall in Portugal) released their self-titled debut album in Japan on Polydor Records. It sold 45,000 in the first month. The band featured his brother Roberto Carlos's son Donovan Bettencourt on bass and New York drummer Jeff Consi. In 2000, Mourning Widow's follow-up, \"Furnished Souls for Rent\" originally released in Japan, and then in the U.S. Both Mourning Widows releases cultivated a strong following in Japan and New England.\n\nIn 2008, Bettencourt was featured on the soundtrack for the motion picture \"Smart People\". Bettencourt is credited on the cover on the soundtrack as well. The soundtrack also features the Gary Cherone track, \"Need I Say More\", and Baby Animals selections. The album was released by Hollywood Records and is available on iTunes. The following year, Bettencourt was featured in a song and video called \"Best Night Ever\" by Marshall Eriksen, a character on \"How I Met Your Mother\". The video was a parody of Extreme's \"More Than Words\" video, in which the entire main cast of \"How I Met Your Mother\" made appearances.\n\nBettencourt formed the recording entity Population 1 and released the self-titled and self-produced 2002 release, \"Population 1\", on Universal/Japan and YBM/Korea. In support of the Population 1 (which featured him playing all instruments on most tracks), release in Japan and Korea, Bettencourt assembled a band with Joe Pessia on bass, Steve Ferlazzo on keyboards and back-up vocals, and Kevin Figueiredo on drums and back-up vocals. Steve Ferlazzo was also featured in Cherone's next band incarnation effort after Van Halen's breakup (Along with Pat Badger and Mike Mangini from Extreme) Tribe of Judah.\n\nIn 2004, Population 1 released \"Sessions from Room Four\" as well as an east coast tour in the fall of that year. Due to legal issues, the name Population 1 was dropped in 2005 and the band was renamed to \"Near Death Experience\", then again, renamed to DramaGods. DramaGods released their first album in December 2005 available as an import via Victor Entertainment (Japan). The band then made their record available as a digital download on iTunes in early 2006.\n\nDramaGods are currently seeking a record deal for release of their first album under the new name in the U.S. After an explosive debut on the increasingly popular \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\", the band (still called 'Population 1' at that point) later appeared on the social networking website MySpace, featuring videos and songs from the aforementioned DramaGods album, entitled \"Love\". Bettencourt decided to make the album available through iTunes before procuring an American record deal.\n\nBettencourt frequently toured with DramaGods in Japan where they appeared at the Udo Music Festival along with KISS, Santana, Jeff Beck, The Doobie Brothers, Alice in Chains, The Pretenders, Ben Folds Five, and others in July 2006 shortly after Bettencourt took part in a three date reunion tour with Extreme in New England.\n\nBettencourt's playing has been featured at 2004 on the Universal/Japan CD and DVD release of \"Guitar Wars\" featuring solo and collective performances of Bettencourt with many others, including Steve Hackett (Genesis, GTR), Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones and Mr. Big/Racer X guitarist Paul Gilbert.\n\nThe Satellite Party is Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell's new project which featured Bettencourt as lead guitarist (Nuno left the band in July 2007, citing disagreements about the direction of the live show), along with DramaGods drummer Kevin Figueiredo, bassist Carl Restivo (who also played with Extreme in the Azores in 2004), and Etty Farrell on backing vocals. An earlier lineup of the band with Perry Farrell, Etty Farrell, Nuno, Kevin Figueiredo, and Steve Ferlazo (Dramagods) on keyboards performed at the 2005 Lollapalooza festival.\n\nBettencourt helped produce \"Ultra Payloaded\", the debut album by Satellite Party released on May 29, 2007 on Columbia Records. On June 29, 2007, they performed alongside Pearl Jam, Kings of Leon and Incubus in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.\nIn late July 2007, Bettencourt and Drummer Kfigg departed Satellite Party.\n\nThe latest CD from magician Criss Angel contains a song on which Bettencourt appears and was released in June 2006. Sully Erna, Vince Neil, Shannon Larkin and Bettencourt join Angel in the video for the track \"MF 2\" which was shot atop the Aladdin parking garage.\n\nIn 1990, Bettencourt played rhythm guitar on the single version of Janet Jackson's \"Black Cat,\" which was his first pop collaboration and a number one hit. In return for his contribution, Jackson was speculated to provide a spoken line on the song \"Money (In God We Trust)\" from Extreme's second album, \"Pornograffiti\".\n\nIn 1993, Bettencourt co-wrote and produced \"Where Are You Going\" for the \"Super Mario Bros.\" movie. He also joined Robert Palmer in the studio to record Palmer's album \"Honey\".\n\nAccording to former Journey lead singer Steve Perry, Bettencourt has teamed with him to write and arrange songs. He also has writing and recording engagements with Maverick Records' Tantric (Bettencourt co-wrote Tantric's hit single \"Hey Now\"), Hollywood recording group BB Mak, Toni Braxton, and numerous others.\n\nBettencourt has also collaborated with singer Suze DeMarchi and with all of her Baby Animals bandmates. On Baby Animals' second release, \"Shaved and Dangerous\", he produced a few songs and co-wrote \"Because I Can\". Additionally, all the members of Baby Animals appeared on Bettencourt's 1997 solo album \"Schizophonic\". He also contributed greatly in writing, recording and producing DeMarchi's solo debut from 1999, \"Telelove\".\n\nIn 1991, Bettencourt also produced Dweezil Zappa's release on Barking Pumpkin Records, \"Confessions\". In this record, Bettencourt also sings lead vocals for the first time on a semi-ballad entitled \"The Kiss\", as well as playing guitar and singing background vocals on some other tracks. Extreme members Gary Cherone and Pat Badger also contributed.\n\nIn 1999, Bettencourt produced the album \"Magnolia\", for the Portuguese singer and actress Lúcia Moniz. He also featured as singer and guitarist in the song \"Try Again\", which was included in \"Magnolia\".\n\nIn 2006, Bettencourt along with his band DramaGods contributed their song \"S'OK\" to the album project Artists for Charity—Guitarists 4 the Kids, produced by Slang Productions to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need.\n\nIn November 2009, Bettencourt announced that he would be touring with Barbadian singer Rihanna on her \"Last Girl on Earth Tour\" as lead guitarist, having appeared alongside her in several TV shows and other performances. He has since performed as Rihanna's lead guitarist on every subsequent tour, including her \"Loud\" (2010), \"777\" (2012) and \"Diamonds World\" (2013) tours.\n\nIn July 2011, Steel Panther reported to \"Loud\" magazine that Nuno would be \"coming in to do something\" on their then-upcoming release \"Balls Out\". The collaboration resulted in the track \"It Won't Suck Itself\", which also featured Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger.\n\nIn April and May 2016, Bettencourt was one of five guitarists featured on the Generation Axe tour.\n\nIn 2017, he performed live during the 2018 World Cup draw.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Nuno Bettencourt among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\nBettencourt was married to lead singer Suze DeMarchi of Baby Animals in 1994. They had two children together, born in 1996 and 2002. The couple separated in 2009.\n\nIn December 1990, Washburn Guitars unveiled the Washburn N4 Nuno Bettencourt Signature Series—a series of Bettencourt-designed guitars.\n\nThe Nuno Bettencourt models are flagshipped by the American hand-made Washburn N4. The Washburn N4 guitar is a small reverse headstock superstrat which features the unique Stephen's Extended Cutaway neck joint for easy access to the higher frets. It also contains Bill Lawrence USA and Seymour Duncan pickups, and a Floyd Rose licensed tremolo. The production budget model of this guitar, which is built in China, is known as the N2 and features a standard bolt-on neck. The N3 was a short run Korean reproduction of the Washburn N4 using Washburn stock pickups. The original N2 and N3 guitars were prototype guitars built for Bettencourt. The N2 lacking the Stephen's Extended Cutaway and the N3 using a Bill Lawrence L500XL in the bridge and a Washburn pickup rather than the Seymour Duncan 59 in the neck. Other models include The N5 and N6. Bettencourt has also endorsed several Washburn acoustic models, as well as a line of 'set-neck' electric guitars including the P-Series which was released in various models with a more retro, deep cutaway style.\n\n"}

Development was originally undertaken to eliminate dependence on importing expensive foreign systems. Various versions of the Anza are currently in service with the Pakistan Army, with the Mk-III version being the most recent. The Anza is also offered for export, Malaysia being its only known export customer after receiving 100 Anza Mk-I in 2002 and, later, a further 500 Anza Mk-II systems.\n\nSome sources state that the Anza Mk-II was co-developed in a joint project by Pakistan and China.\n\nThe Anza Mk-I entered service with the Pakistan Army in January 1990, followed by the Anza Mk-II in September 1994. Serial production of Anza Mk-III for the Pakistan Army was announced in 2006.\n\nIn recent years, Pakistan has advertised the Anza series for export, displaying it at the International Defense Exhibition (IDEX) 2007 event in the United Arab Emirates and at the IDEAS 2008 defence exhibition in Pakistan.\n\nThe Mk-II is known to have the ATS-II Training Simulator included, which consists of a set of four Mk-II training missiles, four firing units, simulated ground batteries, cable interconnectors, PC-based control, monitoring and scoring unit with a target simulator made up of an infrared electric bulb moving along an overhead wire.\n\nThe High Speed Aerial Target Drone, or HISAT-DK, is a high speed, low maintenance target drone that can be used in training operators to use the Anza.

The drones can be used for MANPAD training, though they are also used for other purposes, such as artillery fire support training.\n\n\n\nOn 27 May 1999, the Anza Mk-II was used by the Pakistan Army Air Defence forces to attack an Indian aircraft during the Kargil conflict with India, which shot down three Indian aircraft, one MIG-21 one MiG-27 and one Mi-17.\n\nIn December 2002, The Indian media sources claimed that their soldiers found an Anza Mk-I in a militant hideout near the Line of Control in Kupwara, Kashmir. An Anza system had previously been found at a militant hideout by Indian Army soldiers in 2001.\nIn 2002, Indian media sources again claimed that an Anza MANPAD was fired at an Indian Air Force Antonov An-32 over the Line of Control; the plane was able to land safely.\n\nIn 2004, Saudi Assistant Minister for Defense Prince Khaled ibn Sultan of Saudi Arabia and Defense Minister Rao Sikandar Iqbal of Pakistan had been in talks for joint production of the Anza.\n\nIn 2008, the Pakistan Army conducted exercises with the Anza Mk-II in a semi-desert area near Muzaffargarh in response to covert attacks on targets in north-west Pakistan by American unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), also known as drones. In November 2008, the chief of the Pakistan Air Force told reporters that his forces are fully capable of shooting down the American drones but it was the responsibility of the government to decide whether the drone attacks were stopped through diplomacy or military engagement. In the 2010 Azm-e-Nau 3 exercises, the air defence of Pakistan Army exhibited accurate targeting of enemy's aircraft while in its attacking position, with a pinpoint precision through shoulder operated system of Anza Missiles\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2075211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075211", "title": "Militarization", "text": "Militarization\n\nMilitarization, or militarisation, is the process by which a society organizes itself for military conflict and violence. It is related to militarism, which is an ideology that reflects the level of militarization of a state, and which is associated with the glorification of the military, armed forces and weapons and of military power, including through symbolic displays (e.g., parades of tanks and soldiers) and actual use of force, such as through warfare. The process of militarization involves many interrelated aspects that encompass many levels of society.\n\nThe perceived level of threat influences what potential for violence or warfare the state must achieve to assure itself an acceptable level of security. When the perceived level of threat is low, as with Canada, a country may have a relatively small military and level of armament. However, in Israel, the threat of attack from neighbouring countries means that the armed forces and defense have a high profile and are given significant funding and personnel.\n\nThis threat may involve the:\n\nMilitaristic ideas are referred to within civilian contexts. The War on Poverty declared by President Lyndon B. Johnson, and the War on drugs declared by President Richard Nixon, are rhetorical wars. They are not declared against a concrete, military enemy which can be defeated, but are symbolic of the amount of effort, sacrifice, and dedication which needs to be applied to the issue. They may also be a means of consolidating executive power, because war implies emergency powers for the executive branch which are normally reserved for the legislature. As well, politicians have invoked militaristic ideas with rhetorical wars on other social issues. Some governments draw on militaristic imagery when they appoint \"task forces\" of bureaucrats to address pressing political or social issues.\n\n\nMilitarization has been used as a strategy for boosting a state's economy, by creating jobs and increasing industrial production. This was part of Adolf Hitler's plan to revive the German economy after the devastation it suffered after the First World War.\n\nIncreasingly, Christian evangelical prayer has taken on militaristic forms and language. Spiritual warfare is a form of prayer spoken in militarized discourse. Its adherents, sometimes referring to themselves as \"prayer warriors\", wage \"spiritual battle\" on the \"prayer battlefield.\" Spiritual warfare is the latest iteration in a long-standing partnership between religious organization and militarization, two spheres that are rarely considered together, although aggressive forms of prayer have long been used to further the aims of expanding Christian influence through a variety of conversion tactics. These tactics have begun being articulated in militaristic imagery, using terms such as \"enlist, rally, advance and blitz\". Major moments of increased political militarization have occurred concurrently with the growth of prominence of militaristic imagery in many evangelical communities, such as the evangelical engagement in a militarized project of aggressive missionary expansion conducted against the backdrop of the Vietnam War in the 1970s.\n\nThe military also has a role in defining gender identities. War-movies (i.e. Rambo) reflect the cultural identities of masculinity with the warrior. (See Gibson, 1994.) Representations of Vietnam in popular culture display the male body as a weapon of war and contribute to ideals of masculinity in American culture. Military prowess has been crucial to understandings of contemporary masculinity in European and American culture. During World War I soldiers who experienced shell-shock were seen as failures of masculinity, unable to withstand war as the ultimate task of manliness. The maintenance of military life relies on the ideas about men and manliness as well as ideas about women and femininity, included notions of the fallen women and patriotic motherhood.\n\nWomen have been mobilized during times of war to perform tasks seen as incompatible with men's roles in combat, including cooking, laundry, and nursing. Women have also been seen as necessary for servicing male soldiers' sexual needs through prostitution. For example, during the Vietnam War, Vietnamese women who worked as prostitutes were allowed on US bases as local national Jabaits.\n\nThe role and image of the military within a society is another aspect of militarization. At differing times and places in history, soldiers have been viewed as respectable, honoured individuals (for example, this was the view of Allied soldiers who liberated Nazi-occupied Netherlands in WW II, or the view of Americans and Canadians who place \"support our troops\" car magnets on their vehicles during the war on terror) or even as heroes (for example, the Finnish people's view of the Finnish sniper nicknamed \"White Death\", who killed many Russian invaders); as \"baby killers\" by U.S. anti-war activists during and after the Vietnam war; or as war criminals (the Nazi leaders and SS units responsible for the Holocaust).\nStructural organization is another process of militarization. Before World War II, the United States experienced a post-war reduction of forces after major conflicts, reflecting American suspicion of large standing armies. After World War II, not only was the army maintained, but the National Security Act of 1947 restructured both civilian and military leadership structures, establishing the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. The Act also created permanent intelligence structures (the CIA et al.) within the United States government for the first time, reflecting the civilian government's perception of a need for previously military based intelligence to be incorporated into the structure of the civilian state.\n\nHow citizenship is tied to military service plays an important role in establishing civil-military relations. Countries with volunteer-based military service versus universal conscription have a different mindset. In some countries, men must have served with the military to be considered a citizen. Compare historical Prussia, where every male was required to serve, and service was a requirement of citizenship, to post-Vietnam America's all-volunteer army. In 2016 in Israel, military service is mandatory. This creates a society where almost all people have served in the armed forces. \n\nRacial interactions between society and the military:\n\nEleanor Roosevelt said \"civil rights [is] an international question. . . [that] may decide whether Democracy or Communism wins out in the world.\" (Sherry, 1995, p. 146) and this sort of false dichotomy was continued further throughout the McCarthy era and the Cold War in general.\n\nThe military also serves as a means of social restructuring. Lower classes could gain status and mobility within the military, at least after levée en masse after the French Revolution. Also, the officer corps became open to the middle class, although it was once reserved only for nobility. In Britain, becoming a military officer was an expectation for 'second sons' who were to gain no inheritance; the role of officer was assumed to maintain their noble class. In the United States, military service has been/is advertised as a means for lower-class people to receive training and experience that they would not normally receive, propelling them to higher incomes and higher positions in society. Joining the military has enabled many people from lower socioeconomic demographics to receive college education and training. As well, a number of positions in the military involve transferable skills that can be used in the regular labor market after an individual is discharged (e.g., pilot, air traffic controller, mechanic).\n\nThe militarization of police involves the use of military equipment and tactics by law enforcement officers. This includes the use of armored personnel carriers, assault rifles, submachine guns, flashbang grenades, grenade launchers, sniper rifles, Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams. The militarization of law enforcement is also associated with intelligence agency-style information gathering aimed at the public and political activists, and a more aggressive style of law enforcement. Criminal justice professor Peter Kraska has defined militarization of law enforcement as \"the process whereby civilian police increasingly draw from, and pattern themselves around, the tenets of militarism and the military model.\"\n\nObservers have noted the militarizing of the policing of protests. Since the 1970s, riot police have fired at protesters using guns with rubber bullets or plastic bullets. Tear gas, which was developed for riot control in 1919, is widely used against protesters in the 2000s. The use of tear gas in warfare is prohibited by various international treaties that most states have signed; however, its law enforcement or military use for domestic or non-combat situations is permitted.\n\nConcerns about the militarization of police have been raised by both ends of the political spectrum in the United States, with both the right-of-center/libertarian Cato Institute and the left-of-center American Civil Liberties Union voicing criticisms of the practice. The Fraternal Order of Police has spoken out in favor of equipping law enforcement officers with military equipment, on the grounds that it increases the officers' safety and enables them to protect civilians.\n\n\n\n"}

The per-acid forms a per-ester with the alcohol group. One alkyl substituent migrates from carbon to the adjacent oxygen atom, replacing the carboxylic acid leaving behind a carbocation. A hydrolysis step forms the ketone together with the alcohol. The order of migrationary aptitude is a tert-butyl as the best substituent followed by isopropyl then ethyl and then the methyl group. From this it is inferred that the migrating group carries a partial positive charge in the transition state leading to the carbocation. The consecutive Criegee Rearrangement is carried out in an acidic environment and an ester forms from the carbocation.

The election of García Ramírez restored the independence of the Navarrese kingdom after 58 years of political union with the Kingdom of Aragon. After some initial conflict he would align himself with king Alfonso VII of León and Castile, and as his ally take part in the Reconquista.\n\nGarcía was born to Ramiro Sánchez, lord of Monzón, whose own father Sancho was an illegitimate son of king García Sánchez III of Navarre. His mother was Cristina, daughter of the Castilian nobleman Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, better known as El Cid. He succeeded his father as lord of Monzón and also held Logroño.\n\nIn 1134, a succession crisis arose in the united kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon. As a consequence of the 1076 murder of king Sancho IV of Navarre by his siblings, Navarre had been partitioned between Castile and Aragon, with the kings of the latter claiming the Navarrese crown. With the death of the childless warrior-king Alfonso the Battler of Navarre and Aragon in 1134, the succession of both kingdoms fell into dispute. In his unusual will, Alfonso had left the combined kingdoms to three crusading orders, which effectively neutralized the Papacy from exercising a role in selecting among the potential candidates. Immediately rejected the will, the nobility of Aragon favored Alfonso's younger brother Ramiro, a monk. The nobility of Navarre, skeptical of Ramiro having the necessary temperament to resist the incursions by their western neighbor, king Alfonso VII of León and Castile, who was another claimant, and perhaps chafing under the continued Aragonese hegemony, initially favored a different candidate, Pedro de Atarés, a grandson of Alfonso's illegitimate uncle, Sancho Ramírez, Count of Ribagorza. A convocation of the bishops and nobility was convened at Pamplona to decide between Pedro and Ramiro, but were so alienated by Pedro's arrogance that they abandoned him in favor of a scion of their own dynasty, García Ramírez, Lord of Monzón, who like Pedro descended from an illegitimate brother of a former king. He was duly elected by the nobility and clergy of Navarre, while Ramiro was enthroned by that of Aragon and strongly opposed García's election in Navarre.\n\nIn light of this, the Bishop of Pamplona granted García his church's treasure to fund his government against Ramiro's pretensions. Among García's other early supporters were Lop Ennechones, Martinus de Leit, and Count Latro, who carried out negotiations on the king's behalf with Ramiro. Eventually, however, in January 1135 with the Pact of Vadoluengo the two monarchs reached a mutual accord of \"adoption\": García was deemed the \"son\" and Ramiro the \"father\" in an attempt to maintain both the independence of each kingdom and the \"de facto\" supremacy of the Aragonese one. In May 1135, García declared himself a vassal of Alfonso VII. This simultaneously put him under the protection and lordship of Castile and bought recognition of his royal status from Alfonso, who was a claimant to the Battler's succession. García's submission to Castile has been seen as an act of protection for Navarre that had the consequence of putting her in an offensive alliance against Aragon and, now that García had turned to Alfonso, forced Ramiro to marry and to produce an heir and to forge an alliance with Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. On the other hand, García may have been responding to Ramiro's marriage, which proved beyond a doubt that the king of Aragon was seeking another heir than his distant relative and adopted son.\n\nBefore September 1135, Alfonso VII granted García Zaragoza as a fief. Recently conquered from Aragon, this outpost of Castilian authority in the east was clearly beyond the military capacity of Alfonso to control and provided further reasons for recognition of García in Navarre in return for not only his homage, but his holding Zaragoza on behalf of Castile. In 1136, Alfonso was forced to do homage for Zaragoza to Ramiro and to recognise him as King of Zaragoza. In 1137, Zaragoza was surrendered to Raymond Berengar, though Alfonso retained suzerainty over it. By then, García's reign in Zaragoza had closed.\n\nSometime after 1130, but before his succession, García married Margaret of L'Aigle. She was to bear him a son and successor, Sancho VI, as well as two daughters who each married kings. The elder, Blanche, born after 1133, was originally to marry Raymond Berengar IV as confirmed by a peace treaty in 1149, in spite of the count's existing betrothal to Petronilla of Aragon, but García died before the marriage could be carried out. Instead she married Sancho III of Castile. The younger daughter, Margaret, married William I of Sicily. García's relationship with his first queen was, however, shaky. She supposedly took on many lovers and showed favouritism to her French relatives. She bore a second son named Rodrigo, whom her husband refused to recognise as his own. On 24 June 1144, in León, García married Urraca, called \"La Asturiana\" (the Asturian), illegitimate daughter of Alfonso VII, to strengthen his relationship with his overlord.\n\nIn 1136, García was obliged to surrender Rioja to Castile but, in 1137, he allied with Alfonso I of Portugal and confronted Alfonso VII. They confirmed a peace between 1139 and 1140. He was thereafter an ally of Castile in the Reconquista and was instrumental in the conquest of Almería in 1147. In 1146, he occupied Tauste, which belonged to Aragon, and Alfonso VII intervened to mediate a peace between the two kingdoms.\n\nGarcía died on 21 November 1150 in Lorca, near Estella, and was buried in the cathedral of Santa María la Real in Pamplona. He was succeeded by his eldest son. He left one daughter by Urraca: Sancha, who married successively Gaston V of Béarn and Pedro Manrique de Lara. \n\nGarcía left, as the primary monument of his reign, the monastery of Santa María de la Oliva in Carcastillo. It is a fine example of Romanesque architecture.\n\nGarcía Ramírez married Margaret of L'Aigle, granddaughter of Geoffrey II, Count of Perche. They had four children, but only the first three were recognised by García Ramírez:\n\n\nOn 24 June 1144 he married Urraca of Castile, illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso VII of León and Castile and his mistress Gontrodo Pérez.

It was built in 1844 as an entertainment venue for the restaurant owner Joseph Kroll. During its eventful history it was redeveloped as an opera house in 1851 and was used by various owners and directors for opera, operetta and drama. It was later operated by the Prussian state opera and drama companies and served as the assembly hall of the German Reichstag parliament from 1933 until 1942. On 19 July 1940, the opera house was used to host the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony. Severely damaged by bombing and the Battle of Berlin in World War II, it was finally demolished in 1951.\n\nThe Kroll story began in the Silesian capital Breslau, where the entrepreneur Joseph Kroll (1797–1848) had opened the \"Kroll Winter Garden\" in 1837. The Breslau authorities chose this reputable establishment to entertain the new Prussian King Frederick William IV when he visited the city in 1841. The King was impressed by the splendid, flower-decorated rooms and suggested that something similar should be initiated in Berlin to become the social hub for the nobility in the Prussian residence.\n\nAfter a consultation with his garden director, Peter Joseph Lenné and other members of the government, the king presented an order from the cabinet dated 19 August 1842, which specified the building site on the west side of the parade ground in the Großer Tiergarten park, and laid out the conditions: Kroll was able to use the property without charge, but he would have to return the land and demolish any structures he had built if the project failed. The parade ground, which had stood since 1730, was outside of the city just to the north west of the Brandenburg Gate. It had long degenerated into a sandy field, and the Berliners therefore derisively called it the \"Sahara\". Every step on the sandy ground would kick up a cloud of dust on the square. When it rained, the soil would turn into a mass of dirty mud. Yet Kroll took solace in the fact that the greenery of the Tiergarten park lay just beyond the property.\n\nThe plans for the new building came from the court architect Friedrich Ludwig Persius, which was a good indicator of the significance that the project had for Frederick William IV, co-working with Carl Ferdinand Langhans and Eduard Knoblauch. After a construction period of only ten months, Kroll's enterprise opened on 15 February 1844. Forty waiters were to serve up to five thousand guests in the three halls (the main hall, also referred to as the King's Hall, and two smaller halls), thirteen boxes for at least thirteen people each, and fourteen large rooms (for smaller parties). Sixty musicians provided entertainment. The \"Tunnel\" was a special attraction and praised as a novelty for Berlin – a hall where one could smoke! A technical innovation was the newly implemented gas lighting, which \"consisted of 400 flames\".\n\nDuring the first year Kroll had satisfactory results. The main attractions were the large exhibitions, concerts and balls, which took place around lavishly constructed stage sets, attracting even the \"Waltz King\" Johann Strauss Jr. and his orchestra, who guested at Kroll's in 1845. Yet despite its uniqueness in Germany, as noted by the critics, the enterprise became increasingly difficult to sustain. On 15 April 1848, on his deathbed, Kroll regretted that his King had once had breakfast with him.\"\n\nJoseph Kroll's successor was his eldest daughter, Auguste. The \"National People's Garden\" was opened as soon as May 1848 as part of an expansion. Great attractions were offered first in the garden and later in the great hall, such as performances with wild animals by their tamers and an extensive trade fair in 1849. In 1850 Auguste Kroll established a permanent summer theatre with open-air performances of operas and other events. Here, among others, Auguste's protégé Albert Lortzing directed his operas \"Undine\", \"Der Waffenschmied (The Armourer)\" and \"Zar und Zimmermann\".\n\nThe operation of the new Theatre and Opera Company was suddenly disrupted on 1 February 1851, when the curtains were accidentally set on fire while lamps were being lit. But Auguste Kroll didn't let that stop her; she encashed the fire insurance sum and on 24 February 1852, the theatre already reopened in a completely new building. About a year later, Auguste married her capellmeister, the Hungarian violinist, conductor and businessman Jakob Engel. They successfully expanded the \"Kroll Opera Pool\" and brought many new comic operas to the stage, but also enacted lengthy music dramas by Richard Wagner. But the couple could not prevent the business from closing its doors on 1 April 1855. Despite all efforts, the earnings were far beneath the costs of operation.\n\nOne of the creditors, the entrepreneur Heinrich Bergmann, took over the insolvent operation and brought in such luminaries as Jacques Offenbach for one of his first guest appearances in Berlin. In 1862 however, \"Kroll\" was again forced into auction, which enabled Jakob Engel to buy it back. Although the company was still weighed down by debt, Engel was beaming with optimism, and attempted to bring the Berliners back into his establishment in droves with a diverse program – albeit only with moderate success. The situation worsened in 1869, when the implementation of economic freedom in Prussia led to a boom of newly established amusement parks all over Berlin.\n\nEngel's attempts to sell failed because of the Prussian tax authority and the heavy mortgage that weighed down the business. In addition, the former parade ground had been refurbished and named \"Königsplatz\" (King's Square\") by 18 December 1864, the gardens were redone, and later plans were made for a series of monuments to honour the Prussian victories from 1864-71. After the Franco-Prussian War the Victory Column was solemnly unveiled in the middle of the square on 2 September 1873, while at the same time a long discussion took place at the German Reichstag diet about whether to tear down the Kroll establishment and build a new parliamentary building in its place. Only in 1876 did these proposals, which were so detrimental to any future investments, get tossed out, so that Jakob Engel was able to proceed with the modernization and improvement of his establishment. In 1885 – the first time in Berlin – the old gas lighting was therefore replaced by the \"Edison system\" of electric lighting. Two years later, Engel was also able to secure a contract extension for another forty years, but he ran out of time to implement his plans. He died unexpectedly from a stroke on 28 June 1888. His son tried to continue his work, but the \"lack of interest from the Berlin public\" for the Kroll stage's artistic presentation forced him to sell in 1894.\"\n\nShortly afterwards the building was acquired by the Prussian \"Königliche Schauspiele\" royal theatre company and Kroll's establishment was rebuilt as the \"Neues Königliches Operntheater\", a second state opera house (the other being the Staatsoper Unter den Linden). Works by young composers like Igor Stravinsky and Gustav Mahler were performed here, but also popular concerts given by Enrico Caruso and operettas like \"Die Fledermaus\". As the decent opera house \"Unter den Linden\" did not match with Emperor Wilhelm's attitudes, plans for a new luxuriant opera hall at the site of the Krolloper were developed and demolition had already started in 1914, when the outbreak of World War I halted the construction works.\n\nAfter the war the authorities of the Free State of Prussia were unable to finance the reconstruction, which was finally carried out by the Volksbühne theatre company according to the plans of a \"Volksoper\" (\"People's Opera\") designed by Oskar Kaufmann. Nevertheless it appeared that the Volksbühne company also had overextended itself and the completion of the refurbishment had to be secured by public funds. On 1 January 1924 the building was re-opened again as the \"Oper am Königsplatz\", the second home of the Berlin State Opera, with Erich Kleiber conducting Wagner's \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\". With the square, the house was renamed \"Staatsoper am Platz der Republik\" in 1926. To Berliners it remained known as the Krolloper.\n\nIn 1927 the Kroll Opera was again detached from the Staatsoper Unter den Linder as a separate opera company with Otto Klemperer as its resident conductor, re-opened on 19 November with Beethoven's \"Fidelio\". During Klemperer's term the house saw world premières as Paul Hindemith's \"Neues vom Tage\" in 1929 and Arnold Schönberg's \"Begleitmusik zu einer Lichtspielszene\" in 1930. He worked with renowned conductors like Alexander von Zemlinsky and directors like Gustaf Gründgens, as well as Caspar Neher, László Moholy-Nagy, Teo Otto, Oskar Schlemmer and Giorgio de Chirico as stage designers. The entire singing cast was placed in the hands of the singing pedagogue, Professor Frederick Husler. In an interview on German radio Husler talks about the special atmosphere which existed at the opera house during this period. He mentions some of the singers who were engaged at the time: \"Jarmilla Novotna, who later went to New York to the Metropolitan Opera. Or Kaethe Haidersbach. She became very famous as Evchen in \"Meistersinger\" in Bayreuth. Or Maria Schult-Stormburg and Moie Vorbach, two very distinct personalities. They went to the other house Unter den Linden later. And a very impressive personality: Iso Golland, the Russian. He returned to Russia and has become a highly respected pedagogue.\" He describes the generosity which existed among the singers: \"Their comradeship was extraordinary. No intrigues would arise. I remember that before rehearsals for a performance of \"Die Verkaufte Braut\" three \"Brides\" were sitting in my room. Novotna, Haidersbach and Zaezilie Reich. I remember them discussing, absolutely unselfishly, who of them should sing. Haidersbach said Novotna was the original Czech. Novotna said that Haidersbach had the more suitable lyric voice, whereas she herself was a coloratura soprano. And Reich then put forward an argument (and against herself) the benefit of the whole group. Where could you find such a thing?\"\n\nKlemperer's performances and their modern mise-en-scène were ahead of their time and raised the opposition by conservative circles. In the highly charged political atmosphere during the late days of the Weimar Republic, public pressure made the general administrator of the Prussian state theatres Heinz Tietjen realize that the administration could not afford the funding of three opera houses in Berlin. Despite Klemperer's protests, the Krolloper was finally closed on 3 July 1931 with the last performance of Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\".\n\nThe building stood empty for nearly two years, until the Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933 severely damaged the Reichstag building vis-à-vis. After the German federal election on 5 March 1933, the Krolloper became the seat of the Reichstag. It was chosen both because of its convenient location and for its seating capacity. On 23 March 1933, the majority of the Reichstag delegates in the Kroll Opera House disempowered themselves passing the \"Enabling Act\" that gave Adolf Hitler virtually unlimited authority. At this time the elected MPs of the Communist Party and several Social Democrats were already in hiding or arrested. After the election on 12 November 1933 the National Socialists occupied all seats.\n\nThe main hall of the Krolloper was used for sittings of the Reichstag from 1933 to 1942. It was here on 30 January 1939, the sixth anniversary of the \"Machtergreifung\" (the election of Hitler as \"Reichskanzler\"), that Hitler warned: \"If international finance Jewry in and outside Europe should again succeed in plunging the nations into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe.\"\nThe grandiose plans of Welthauptstadt Germania, prepared by Albert Speer for Hitler, included the demolition of the Kroll Opera House and its replacement by a sumptuous \"Führer's Palace\", which would have stood on the western side of a \"Großer Platz\" with an area of around . The outbreak of war and Germany's eventual defeat prevented any of this from being implemented.\n\nThe last session of the Reichstag was held in the Kroll Opera House on 26 April 1942, passing a decree proclaiming Hitler \"Supreme Judge of the German People,\" allowing him to override the judiciary and administration in all matters. In those last days the building once again was the site of several performances of the Berlin State Opera after the house \"Unter den Linden\" had been damaged by air raids. However, the Krolloper itself was devastated by a RAF Bomber Command attack on 22 November 1943. It was further damaged in the last days of World War II in Europe when forces of the Red Army stormed the Reichstag ruin.\n\nHowever, already in the summer of 1945 a restaurant re-opened in the gardens of Kroll's establishment, keeping up business even after the remains of the building were demolished in 1951. The \"Kroll-Garten\" inn finally closed in 1956 and one year later the last premises were cleared. Today the site is nothing but a large lawn south of the \"Bundeskanzleramt\", since 2007 marked by a memorial plaque.\n\n"}

This is what we would intuitively expect from a measure of dimension. The real utility of the correlation dimension is in determining the (possibly fractional) dimensions of fractal objects. There are other methods of measuring dimension (e.g. the Hausdorff dimension, the box-counting dimension, and the\ninformation dimension) but the correlation dimension has the advantage of being straightforwardly and quickly calculated, of being less noisy when only a small number of points is available, and is often in agreement with other calculations of dimension.\n\nFor any set of \"N\" points in an \"m\"-dimensional space\n\nthen the correlation integral \"C\"(\"ε\") is calculated by:\n\nwhere \"g\" is the total number of pairs of points which have a distance between them that is less than distance \"ε\" (a graphical representation of such close pairs is the recurrence plot). As the number of points tends to infinity, and the distance between them tends to zero, the correlation integral, for small values of \"ε\", will take the form:\n\nIf the number of points is sufficiently large, and evenly distributed, a log-log graph of the correlation integral versus \"ε\" will yield an estimate of \"ν\". This idea can be qualitatively understood by realizing that for higher-dimensional objects, there will be more ways for points to be close to each other, and so the number of pairs close to each other will rise more rapidly for higher dimensions.\n\nGrassberger and Procaccia introduced the technique in 1983; the article gives the results of such estimates for a number of fractal objects, as well as comparing the values to other measures of fractal dimension. The technique can be used to distinguish between (deterministic) chaotic and truly random behavior, although it may not be good at detecting deterministic behavior if the deterministic generating mechanism is very complex.\n\nAs an example, in the \"Sun in Time\" article, the method was used to show that the number of sunspots on the sun, after accounting for the known cycles such as the daily and 11-year cycles, is very likely not random noise, but rather chaotic noise, with a low-dimensional fractal attractor.\n\n"}
{"id": "2075256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075256", "title": "Cruising (film)", "text": "Cruising (film)\n\nCruising is a 1980 American erotic crime thriller film written and directed by William Friedkin and starring Al Pacino, Paul Sorvino, and Karen Allen. It is loosely based on the novel of the same name by \"New York Times\" reporter Gerald Walker about a serial killer targeting gay men, particularly those men associated with the leather scene in the late 1970s. The title is a play on words with a dual meaning because \"cruising\" can describe police officers on patrol and gay men who are cruising for sex.\n\nPoorly received by critics upon release, \"Cruising\" performed moderately at the box office. The shooting and promotion were dogged by gay rights protesters, who believed that the film stigmatized them. The film is also notable for its open-ended finale, which was criticized by Robin Wood and Bill Krohn as further complicating what they felt were the director's incoherent changes to the rough cut and synopsis, as well as other production issues.\n\nIn New York City during the middle of a hot summer, body parts of men are showing up in the Hudson River. The police suspect it to be the work of a serial killer who is picking up gay men at West Village bars like the Eagle's Nest, the Ramrod, and the Cock Pit, then taking them to cheap rooming houses or motels, tying them up and stabbing them to death.\n\nOfficer Steve Burns (Al Pacino), who resembles the victims' dark-haired, slim profile, is sent deep undercover by Captain Edelson (Paul Sorvino) into the urban world of gay S&M and leather bars in the Meatpacking District in order to track down the killer. Burns is at first reluctant to accept the assignment but he is ambitious and sees a high-profile case as a way to rapidly advance his career. He rents an apartment in the area and befriends a neighbor, Ted Bailey (Don Scardino), a struggling young gay playwright who does tech support to pay the bills. Burns's undercover work takes a toll on his relationship with his girlfriend Nancy (Karen Allen), due to both his refusal to tell her the details of his current assignment and his developing friendship with Ted, who himself is having relationship problems with his jealous and overbearing dancer boyfriend, Gregory (James Remar).\n\nBurns mistakenly compels the police to interrogate a waiter, Skip Lee (Jay Acovone), who is intimidated and beaten to coerce a confession before the police discover Skip's fingerprints don't match the killer's. Burns is disturbed by this police brutality, and tells Captain Edelson he didn't sign on for this so that they can arrest anyone just because they are gay. Exhausted by his undercover assignment, Burns is close to quitting, but is convinced by Edelson to continue with the investigation. Edelson in turn reprimands the officers behind the interrogation of Skip.\n\nFollowing a new lead, Burns investigates students at Columbia University who studied with one of the previous victims, a college professor. Burns thinks that he has found the serial killer: Stuart Richards (Richard Cox), a gay music graduate student with schizophrenic disorder who attacks him with a knife in Morningside Park. Burns brings the man into custody, but shortly afterward, Ted's mutilated body is found. The police dismiss the murder as a lover's quarrel turned violent and put out an arrest warrant for Gregory, with whom Burns earlier had a fight over his relationship with Ted.\n\nWith the police under the impression that the murders have been solved because Richards is in custody, Burns moves back in with Nancy. As Burns shaves his beard in the bathroom, Nancy tries on his clothes—a leather peaked cap, aviator frames, and a leather jacket—while her boyfriend looks at himself in the mirror.\n\nPhilip D'Antoni, who had produced Friedkin's 1971 film \"The French Connection\", approached Friedkin with the idea of directing a film based on \"New York Times\" reporter Gerald Walker's 1970 novel \"Cruising\" about a serial killer targeting New York City's gay community. Friedkin was not particularly interested in the project. D'Antoni tried to attach Steven Spielberg, but they were not able to interest a studio. A few years later, Jerry Weintraub brought the idea back to Friedkin, who was still not interested. Friedkin changed his mind following a series of unsolved killings in gay leather bars in the early 1970s and the articles written about the murders by \"Village Voice\" journalist Arthur Bell. Friedkin also knew a police officer named Randy Jurgensen who had gone into the same sort of deep cover that Pacino's Steve Burns did to investigate an earlier series of gay murders, and Paul Bateson, a doctor's assistant who had appeared in Friedkin's 1973 film \"The Exorcist\", who, while being prosecuted for another murder, was implicated (though never charged) in six of the leather bar murders. All of these factors gave Friedkin the angle he wanted to pursue in making the film. Jurgensen and Bateson served as film consultants, as did Sonny Grosso, who earlier had consulted with Friedkin on \"The French Connection\". Jurgensen and Grosso appear in bit parts in the film.\n\nIn his research, Friedkin worked with members of the Mafia, who at the time owned many of the city's gay bars. Al Pacino was not Friedkin's first choice for the lead; Richard Gere had expressed a strong interest in the part, and Friedkin had opened negotiations with Gere's agent. Gere was Friedkin's choice because he believed that Gere would bring an androgynous quality to the role that Pacino could not.\n\nThe film was intended to depict gay cruising as it existed at the Mineshaft, though that bar is not named in the movie; since the Mineshaft would not allow filming, scenes from the movie were filmed at the Hellfire Club, which was decorated to resemble the Mineshaft. Regulars from the Mineshaft appeared as extras. Scenes were shot in streets and other locations near the Mineshaft. Pacino attended as part of researching his role. (A bar called the Mineshaft does not appear in the novel which, with substantial changes, was the inspiration for the film.)\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America originally gave \"Cruising\" an X rating. Friedkin claims he took the film before the MPAA board \"50 times\" at a cost of $50,000 and deleted 40 minutes of footage from the original cut before he secured an R rating. The deleted footage, according to Friedkin, consisted entirely of footage from the clubs in which portions of the film were shot and consisted of \"[a]bsolutely graphic sexuality...that material showed the most graphic homosexuality with Pacino watching, and with the intimation that he may have been participating.\" In some discussions, Friedkin claims that the missing 40 minutes had no effect on the story or the characterizations, but in others he states that the footage created \"mysterious twists and turns (which [the film] no longer takes)\", that the suspicion that Pacino's character may have himself become a killer was made more clear and that the missing footage simultaneously made the film both more and less ambiguous. When Friedkin sought to restore the missing footage for the film's DVD release, he discovered that United Artists no longer had it. He believes that UA destroyed the footage. Some obscured sexual activity remains visible in the film as released, and Friedkin intercut a few frames of gay pornography into the first scene in which a murder is depicted.\n\nThis movie represents the only film soundtrack work by the punk rock band the Germs. They recorded six songs for the film, of which only one, \"Lion's Share\", appeared. The cut \"Shakedown, Breakdown\" was written and recorded especially for the film by cult band Rough Trade. Soundtrack director Nitzsche had initially attempted to include two songs, \"Endless Night\" and \"Devil's Sidewalk\", by Graham Parker and the Rumour in the film, but legal issues prevented the songs from being used. The songs would appear on Parker's 1980 album, \"The Up Escalator\".\n\nFriedkin asked gay author John Rechy, some of whose works were set in the same milieu as the film, to screen \"Cruising\" just before its release. Rechy had written an essay defending Friedkin's right to make the film, although not defending the film itself. At Rechy's suggestion, Friedkin deleted a scene showing the Gay Liberation slogan \"We Are Everywhere\" as graffiti on a wall just before the first body part is pulled from the river, and added a disclaimer:\n\n\"This film is not intended as an indictment of the homosexual world. It is set in one small segment of that world, which is not meant to be representative of the whole.\"\n\nFriedkin later claimed that it was the MPAA and United Artists that required the disclaimer, calling it \"part of the dark bargain that was made to get the film released at all\" and \"a sop to organized gay rights groups\". Friedkin claimed that no one involved in making the film thought it would be considered as representative of the entire gay community, but gay film historian Vito Russo disputes that, citing the disclaimer as \"an admission of guilt. What director would make such a statement if he truly believed that his film would not be taken to be representative of the whole?\"\n\nThroughout the summer of 1979, members of New York City's gay community protested against the production of the film. Protests started at the urging of gay journalist Arthur Bell, whose series of articles on unsolved murders of gay men inspired the film. Gay people were urged to disrupt filming, and gay-owned businesses to bar the filmmakers from their premises. People attempted to interfere with shooting by pointing mirrors from rooftops to ruin lighting for scenes, blasting whistles and air horns near locations, and playing loud music. One thousand protesters marched through the East Village demanding the city withdraw support for the film. As a result of interference, the movie's audio largely was overdubbed in order to remove the noise caused by off-camera protesters.\n\nAl Pacino said that he understood the protests but insisted that upon reading the screenplay he never at any point felt that the film was anti-gay. He said that the leather bars were \"just a fragment of the gay community, the same way the Mafia is a fragment of Italian-American life\", referring to \"The Godfather\", and that he would \"never want to do anything to harm the gay community\".\n\n\"Cruising\" was released February 15, 1980, in the United States and had a box office take of $19.8 million.\n\nCritical reaction to the film was highly negative, and LGBT activists publicly protested against \"Cruising\". However, critical opinion has warmed somewhat over the years as the film has been reassessed. , the film holds a 49% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews, with a weighted average of 5.33/10. Upon its original release, Roger Ebert gave \"Cruising\" two and a half out of four stars, describing it as well-filmed and suspenseful yet it \"seems to make a conscious decision not to declare itself on its central subject\"—the true feelings of Pacino's character about the S&M subculture, which are never explored to Ebert's satisfaction.\n\nCritic Jack Sommersby's comments typified the contemporary criticism directed at non-political matters such as character development and the changes made when the film was transferred from a novel to a film:\n\nThe second major criticism of the film at its release came from gay activists who felt that the film had a homophobic political message, and that it portrayed gay men as being attracted to violence, which could in turn justify homophobic hate crimes. Ebert, however, said, \"The validity of these arguments is questionable.\" But several critics also have taken issue with its portrayal of gay men. TV Guide's Movie Guide, for example, noticed that the gay scene is portrayed in the movie \"as irredeemably sick and violent\", with \"virtually nobody [being] portrayed sympathetically\". Brian Juergens, associate editor with gay culture website AfterEllen, contended that the movie \"viciously exploited\" the gay community, arguing that gay male sexuality does not seem to serve any purpose in the plot other than being a prop to shock heterosexual audiences. Though the film contains a disclaimer saying that it does not intend to be \"an indictment of the homosexual world\", Juergens states that certain elements in the plot—especially the fact that it is hinted that several gay male killers are operating simultaneously—\"makes a clear statement (however unintended the filmmakers may maintain it is) about a community as a whole\".\n\nVito Russo wrote, \"Gays who protested the making of the film maintained that it would show that when Pacino recognized his attraction to the homosexual world, he would become psychotic and begin to kill,\" with at least one critic agreeing that Burns' \"willingness to sleep with a man is [portrayed as] the ultimate descent into depravity.\" However, in \"Exorcising Cruising\", a behind-the-scenes documentary on the \"Cruising\" DVD, Friedkin alleges that the film was supported by much of New York City's leather/S&M community, who appeared by the dozens as extras in the nightclub scenes.\n\nRaymond Murray, editor of \"Images in the Dark\" (an encyclopedia of gay and lesbian films) writes that \"the film proves to be an entertaining and (for those born too late to enjoy the sexual excesses of pre-AIDS gay life) fascinating if ridiculous glimpse into gay life—albeit Hollywood's version of gay life.\" He goes on to say \"the film is now part of queer history and a testament to how a frightened Hollywood treated a disenfranchised minority.\"\n\nIn retrospect, William Friedkin said: \"\"Cruising\" came out around a time that gay liberation had made enormous strides among the general public. It also came out around the same time that AIDS was given a name. I simply used the background of the S&M world to do a murder mystery; it was based on a real case. But the timing of it was difficult because of what had been happening to gay people. Of course, it was not really set in a gay world; it was the S&M world. But many critics who wrote for gay publications or the underground press felt that the film was not the best foot forward as far as gay liberation was concerned, and they were right. Now it’s reevaluated as a film. It could be found wanting as a film, but it no longer has to undergo the stigma of being an anti-gay screed, which it never was.\"\n\nIn a 2006 interview, professor Camille Paglia stated: \"I loved \"Cruising\" — while everyone else was furiously condemning it. It had an underground decadence that wasn’t that different from \"The Story of O\" or other European high porn of the 1960s.\"\n\nIn the 1995 documentary \"The Celluloid Closet\" (adapted from Vito Russo's books on homosexuals in the film industry), Ron Nyswaner, screenwriter for \"Philadelphia\", claims he and a boyfriend were threatened with violence by a group of men who stated that \"Cruising\" was their motivation.\n\nAccording to a 2013 book by film professor R. Hart Kylo-Patrick, \"Two months after the film's release, a bar prominently displayed in the movie came under attack by a man with a sub-machine gun, killing two patrons and wounding 12 others. Friedkin refused to comment on the attack.\" A 2016 article in \"The New York Times\" identifies the culprit of this shooting as Ronald K. Crumpley, formerly a New York City Transit Police officer. He first shot two people outside a delicatessen with an Uzi, then walked a few blocks where he shot into a group of men standing outside The Ramrod, a gay bar. In total he shot eight persons, two of whom died. Crumpley was said to have stated to police after his arrest: “I’ll kill them all — the gays — they ruin everything.\" He was found \"not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect\" and spent the rest of his life at a psychiatric hospital, dying at the age of 73 in 2015. \"The New York Times\" article from 2016 does not mention \"Cruising\" or Friedkin and it is not clear if the film played any role in the attack.\n\nRobert Mapplethorpe’s initial interest in the black male form was inspired by (in addition to films like \"Mandingo\"), the interrogation scene in \"Cruising\", in which an unknown black character enters the interrogation room and slaps the protagonist across the face.\n\nA deluxe collector's edition DVD, distributed by Warner Home Video, was released in 2007 and 2008. This release was not a director's cut, but did include some scenes not seen in the original VHS release, and additional visual effects added by Friedkin. Friedkin did a director's commentary track for the DVD. This version did not have a disclaimer at the beginning stating that \"Cruising\" depicts a gay S&M subculture and is not representative of mainstream gay life. The DVD included two bonus features titled 'The History of Cruising' and 'Exorcising Cruising', the latter about the controversy the film provoked during principal photography, and after it was released. The DVD is no longer available. A Special Edition Blu-ray with a restored print of the film was released by Arrow on August 20, 2019. It has similar bonus features.\n\nIn 2013, filmmakers James Franco and Travis Mathews released \"Interior. Leather Bar.\", a film in which they appear as filmmakers working on a film which reimagines and attempts to recreate the 40 minutes of deleted and lost footage from \"Cruising\". (The period after \"Interior\" is a reference to \"Cruising\"'s shooting script, describing an indoor scene at such a bar.) The film is not actually a recreation of the footage, however; instead, it uses a docufiction format to explore the creative and ethical issues arising from the process of trying to film such a project.\n\n\n\n"}

When he was about nine, he moved with his family to Missouri. There, his father became a cook in a restaurant in Troy, while the rest of the family stayed in St. Louis. Cohran played trumpet in bands led by Jay McShann in the early 1950s, and then in a U.S. Navy band.\n\nHe was introduced to the Sun Ra Arkestra by John Gilmore in 1959. He appeared on the albums \"Fate In A Pleasant Mood\" and \"Angels and Demons at Play\" among others. He played mostly trumpet and sometimes stringed instruments such as the zither.\n\nWhen the Arkestra moved from Chicago in 1961, Cohran declined to accompany them. In 1965 he took part in the founding of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). He formed the Artistic Heritage Ensemble with Pete Cosey, future members of Earth, Wind and Fire's horn section and Motown percussionist \"Master\" Henry Gibson, among others.

The \"Ramayana\" describes Mandodari as beautiful, pious, and righteous. She is extolled as one of the \"Panchakanya\" (\"Five Girls\"), the recital of whose names is believed to dispel sin.\n\nMandodari was the daughter of Mayasura, the King of the Asuras (demons), and the \"apsara\" (celestial nymphs) Hema. Mandodari bears two sons: Meghanada (Indrajit) and Akshayakumara. According to some Ramayana adaptations, Mandodari is also the mother of Rama's wife Sita, who is infamously kidnapped by Ravana. Despite her husband's faults, Mandodari loves him and advises him to follow the path of righteousness. Mandodari repeatedly advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but her advice falls on deaf ears. Her love and loyalty to Ravana are praised in the \"Ramayana\".\n\nDifferent versions of the \"Ramayana\" record her ill-treatment at the hands of Rama's monkey generals. Some versions say they disturb a sacrifice by Ravana, and some that they destroy her chastity, which was the last protection for Ravana's life. Hanuman tricks her into disclosing the location of a magical arrow which Rama uses to kill Ravana.\n\nThe Valmiki Ramayana does not mention the story of Mandodari. It is only known that Mandodari was the daughter of Mayasura and Hema. \nHowever various other Ramayan have different contradictory stories. One such is from Uttara Ramayana.\n\nThe \"Uttara Ramayana\" narrates a story about the birth of Mandodari. Mayasura (Maya), the son of sage Kashyapa is married to the \"apsara\" (heavenly nymph) Hema. They have two sons, Mayavi and Dundubhi, but long for a daughter, so they start performing penances to seek the favour of the god Shiva.\n\nMeanwhile, an apsara named Madhura arrives at Mount Kailash, the abode of Shiva, to pay her respects. In absence of his wife Parvati, Madhura has an union with Shiva. When Parvati returns, she finds traces of ashes from Shiva’s body on the breasts of Madhura. Agitated, Parvati curses Madhura and sends her to live in a well as a frog for twelve years. Shiva consoles Madhura and says she will become a beautiful woman and be married to a great valorous man. After twelve years, Madhura becomes a beautiful maiden again and cries out loudly from the well. Mayasura and Hema, who are performing penance nearby, answer her call and adopt her as their daughter. They bring her up as Mandodari.\n\nRavana comes to the house of Mayasura and falls in love with Mandodari. Mandodari and Ravana are soon married with Vedic rites. Mandodari bears Ravana three sons: Meghanada (Indrajit) and Akshayakumara. Mandore, a town located 9 km north of Jodhpur, is believed to be the native place of Mandodari. Ravana is treated as a son-in-law among some local Brahmins and has a temple dedicated to him here.\n\nDespite Ravana's faults, Mandodari loves him and is proud of his strength. She is aware of Ravana's weakness towards women. A righteous woman, Mandodari tries to lead Ravana to righteousness, but Ravana always ignores her advice. She advises him to not to subdue the \"Navagraha\", the nine celestial beings that govern one's destiny, and not to seduce Vedavati, who would be reborn as Sita and cause the destruction of Ravana.\n\nRavana kidnaps Sita, the wife of Rama, the exiled prince of Ayodhya, who is an incarnation of the god Vishnu. Mandodari advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but to no avail. Mandodari knows this lust will bring the downfall of Ravana.\nMandodari is described as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When Hanuman, the monkey messenger of Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita. When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana raises his sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of a woman is a heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up the idea of having Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita. Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like Sachi and Rohini.\n\nWhen all attempts for a peaceful return of Sita fail, Rama declares war on Ravana's Lanka. Before the final battle against Rama, Mandodari makes a last attempt to dissuade Ravana, but to no avail. Finally, Mandodari stands by her husband in the final battle like an obedient and faithful wife, though she advises her son Meghanada, alias Indrajit (\"One who had conquered Indra; the god-king of heaven\"), not to fight Rama.\n\nSeveral manuscripts of the \"Ramayana\" mention a story in which Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in presence of Ravana as a punishment for Ravana's treatment of Sita. Satyatirtha, a commentator on \"Ramayana\", dismisses this story as spurious. According to this story: When all of Ravana's sons and warriors die, Ravana organizes a \"yajna\" (\"fire sacrifice\") to assure his victory. Rama sends a troop of monkeys headed by Hanuman and the monkey prince Angada to destroy this \"yajna\". The monkeys create havoc in Ravana's palace, but Ravana continues the \"yajna\". Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in front of Ravana. Mandodari pleads to her husband to save her and reminds him what Rama is doing for his wife. The enraged Ravana abandons the \"yajna\" and strikes Angada with his sword. With the \"yajna\" disturbed, Angada's purpose is served and he leaves Mandodari and escapes. Mandodari again implores Ravana to surrender Sita to Rama, but he refuses. Other Ramayana adaptations present more gruesome descriptions of the incident. The \"Krittivasi Ramayan\" narrates that the monkeys dragged Mandodari and tore off her clothes. In \"Bicitra Ramayana\", it is Hanuman who humiliates Mandodari. The Thai adaptation \"Ramakien\" narrates a symbolic rape of Mandodari. Hanuman sleeps with her in the form of Ravana and destroys her chastity, which protects Ravana's life.\n\nRavana fights the final duel with Rama. Rama fails to kill Ravana with his ordinary arrows, but finally kills with a magical arrow. While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical arrow was given to Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess Parvati for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a Brahmin. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the arrow. Hanuman seizes the arrow and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end. Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death. In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons and her kinsmen.\n\nAfter the death of Ravana, Rama advises Vibhishana to take Mandodari as his wife, even though he already has a wife. A theory suggests that Ravana's race may have had matrilineal families and thus, to restore order in the kingdom after Ravana's death, it was necessary for Vibhishana to marry the reigning queen to get the right to rule. Another theory suggests it may be a non-Aryan custom to marry the reigning queen. The marriage between Mandodari and Vibhishana is purely an \"act of statesmanship\", rather than a marriage based on their \"mutual sexual interference\". Mandodari may have agreed to marry Vibhishana, her younger brother-in-law, as this would lead the kingdom to prosperity and stability as allies of Rama's Ayodhya, and she would continue to have a say in governance. Another reason for the marriage is as an alternative to suicide for the widowed Mandodari, which is averted by Rama.\n\nThough Valmiki's Ramayana does not record Mandodari as being the mother of Sita, some later adaptations of the Ramayana depict Mandodari as the mother of Sita or at least the cause of the latter's birth.\n\nThe \"Adbhuta Ramayana\" narrates: Ravana used to store the blood of sages he killed in a large pot. The sage Gritsamada was practicing penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with mantras in a pot so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking the contents of the blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in Kurukshetra, where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.\n\nThe \"Devi Bhagavata Purana\" says: When Ravana wants to marry Mandodari, Maya warns him that her horoscope indicated her first-born would destroy her clan and should be killed. Ignoring Maya's advice, Ravana buries his first child by Mandodari in a casket in Janaka’s city, where it is discovered and grew up as Sita. Jain adaptations of the Ramayana like \"Vasudevahindi\", \"Uttara-purana\", and others also state that Sita is the daughter of Ravana and Mandodari, and is abandoned when she is prophesied to be the cause of the end of Ravana and his family.\n\nIn the Malay \"Seri Rama\" and the Indonesian-Javanese \"Rama Keling\", Ravana wants to possess Mandodari, the mother of Rama, but instead marries a pseudo-Mandodari, who looks like the real one. Rama's father has a union with this pseudo-Mandodari, resulting in the birth of Sita, who is nominally Ravana's daughter.\n\nAccording to the \"Ananda Ramayana\", king Padmaksha had a daughter named Padma - an incarnate of the goddess Lakshmi. When her marriage is organized, Rakshasas (demons) kill the king. The grief-stricken Padma jumps into fire. Ravana discovers her body, which had turned into five jewels, in the fire and takes it to Lanka sealed in a box. Mandodari opens the box and finds Padma inside it. She advises Ravana to cast off the box containing the ill-fated Padma, who led to the doom of her father. When the lid of the box is closed, Padma curses Ravana that she will return to Lanka and cause his doom. Ravana buries the box in the city of Janaka, who discovers Padma and brings her up as Sita.\n\nRemembering ever the virgins five -Ahalya, Draupadi, Sita, Tara and Mandodari\nDestroys the greatest of sins.\nHindus remember the \"panchakanya\" - the five virgins or maidens in this daily prayer, though none of them is considered an ideal woman who could be emulated. Mandodari, with Ahalya and Tara, belong to the \"Ramayana\", while the rest are from the \"Mahabharata\". Among the five elements, Mandodari is equated to water, \"turbulent on the surface and deep in her spiritual quest\". The writer Dhanalakshmi Ayyer says:\n\nHer story is a reminder that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.\nMandodari's role is short in the Ramayana but very important. She is described as a pious and righteous royal lady. Compared to the rest of the \"panchakanya\", Mukherjee considers Mandodari's life as \"less colourful and eventful\". He adds: \"Mandodari seldom got prominence ... Her image lacks substance and fades quickly\", though he lays stress on her love and loyalty towards her husband. Pradip Bhattacharya, author of the book \"Panchkanya: Women of Substance\" notes that \"there is hardly anything special that Valmiki (Ramayana) has written about her (Mandodari) except that she warns her husband to return Sita and has enough influence to prevent him from raping her.\"\n\nMandodari's name is used for one of the letters of the Thai alphabet, \"tho montho\" (ฑ มณโฑ).\n\n"}

Perhaps best known for his cult film \"Mod Fuck Explosion\", \nMoritsugu's films have been screened at Sundance, Cannes, Berlin, Toronto, Rotterdam, Venice, New York Underground, Chicago Underground, MoMA, Guggenheim, Whitney and numerous other festivals and museums. In 2001 he received the Moving Image award from Creative Capital.\n\nMoritsugu started filmmaking in high school in the early 1980s and then attended Brown University, where he studied semiotics and critical theory. Classmates in his department included director Todd Haynes, producer Christine Vachon and studio head-producer Nina Jacobson. Moritsugu's senior thesis film, \"Der Elvis\", was called by \"The Village Voice\" critic J. Hoberman \"one of the top 50 films of the eighties.\"\nThe New York Times described it as \"a 23-minute jolt of highly controlled chaos.\" Upon graduating in 1987, he commenced production on his first feature, \"My Degeneration\", but an industrial accident in which his right arm was pulled into a conveyor belt and nearly severed postponed the project. After a lengthy hospital stay and rehabilitation, he was able to restart the movie, which he looked at as a form of \"physical therapy.\" \"My Degeneration\", about an all-girl rock band playing music for the beef industry, starred his future wife Amy Davis. It played at a number of film festivals including Sundance, where Roger Ebert walked out after 7 minutes. Rolling Stone named it one of the \"25 Greatest Punk Rock Movies of All Time\" and said: \"Underground filmmaker/art terrorist Jon Moritsugu reimagines a rise-and-fall showbiz narrative as a scuzzy, 16mm skullfuck opus set in a lo-fi punk world...This movie feels like punk rock: dirty, angry, righteous, handmade, exhilirating.\" The movie was self-released theatrically, after which Moritsugu moved to the West Coast in 1990.\n\nSettling in San Francisco, Moritsugu completed \"Hippy Porn\" in 1991, a 16 mm black-and-white feature which shot for 10 days. Redolent of early Jim Jarmusch, it follows several terminally bored students at a pretentious art school, perfectly nailing the pervasive jadedness of wannabe artists. Top indie label Matador Records was to release the movie's soundtrack, but after numerous and lengthy delays, Moritsugu terminated the deal. Stated label head Gerard Cosloy, \"Jon Moritsugu set the \"Hippy Porn\" contract on fire and tore the CD negatives apart with his teeth (we didn't have the guts to tell him the test pressings arrived that day).\"\n\"Hippy Porn\" was released theatrically in America and gained noticeable notoriety. Picked up for European distribution, the movie was a hit in the Netherlands, Switzerland and France, playing non-stop in Paris for over one year at the Action Christine Cinema.\n\nMoritsugu immediately started pre-production in 1992 for \"Mod Fuck Explosion\", which starred Amy Davis. This low-budget riff on the teen film loosely revolved around a lonely girl's search for a leather jacket while a turf war between mods and bikers looms. The movie, produced by Henry S. Rosenthal and co-produced by Andrea Sperling, was shot by Todd Verow in 16mm.\nIt featured a dream sequence set in garden of meat, which was filmed in Rosenthal's garage with 800 pounds of raw, rotting beef. After wrapping, and in the middle of post-production in 1993, Moritsugu received word that he had received a grant from ITVS to create a PBS television show. He says: \"I completed (the script) in 42 hours... and it got the green light. So right after shooting \"Mod Fuck Explosion\", I got $360,000 to shoot \"Terminal USA\".\n\n\"Terminal USA\", filmed in Panavision 16mm, was a vicious sitcom parody laying to waste the studious image of the \"model minority.\" The director himself played twins - a drug-dealing son and a repressed and closeted math nerd - in a radically dysfunctional Asian American family. The movie was an extreme challenge for Moritsugu, who again worked with producer Andrea Sperling and director of photography Todd Verow. In addition to complications with insurance, payroll, salaries and a large unionized cast and crew, the production itself was fraught with problems including a major outbreak of scabies on the set. Executive produced by James Schamus (former CEO of Focus Features), Moritsugu stated: \"I sort of blew it. I was young, full of myself, no one could help me. I basically spit in his face\". When \"Terminal USA\" was completed, it caused a firestorm of controversy with the conservative right because it had been funded with taxpayer money. It screened at the Toronto and Rotterdam Film Festivals and was broadcast on television in over 200 cities across America.\n\nAfter a European promotional tour and American appearances to support \"Terminal USA\", Moritsugu resumed post-production work on \"Mod Fuck Explosion\". \"A defiantly rough-hewn return to barely-aboveground roots despite some overlaps with \"Terminal USA\",\" it was completed in 1994 and won \"Best Feature\" Award at the New York Underground Film Festival. It played the film fest circuit and received tremendous attention, with Moritsugu saying, \"Mod Fuck blew-up in Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries—they really responded to the angst, death, and Amy as a hot blonde walking on raw meat.\" In America, the movie opened in a number of cities including a 13-week engagement in Los Angeles at the Laemmle Sunset 5 and sold-out runs in Seattle and Baltimore. Giant Robot said about the movie: \"Jon Moritsugu hit some weird epiphany during the making of this film, which was his first mass-watchable work. Jon’s wife Amy Davis plays a performance art girl who’s caught in a rumble between a small group of mods and a Japanese motorcycle gang. […] The performances are weird, intentionally screwed up, and dumb, but that’s part of the film’s brilliance. If you’re a fan of strange flicks, you’ll start remembering the lines and using them. […] Awesome soundtrack by Unrest and Karyo Tengoku\". The movie was picked by the readers of \"Wired\" as one of the \"Wildest Exploitation Movies,\" sharing the honor with \"Eraserhead\", \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\", \"Night of the Living Dead\" and \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\".\n\nMoritsugu's next feature was 1997's \"Fame Whore\", which reprised sitcom mockery and absurdism in service of three parallel stories critiquing fame and featuring Amy Davis as a stoner, trust-fund brat. Produced again by Andrea Sperling, the 16mm movie was a recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation Award. It received \"Best Feature\" and \"Festival Choice\" honors at the New York Underground Film Festival and the Los Angeles Times said of it, \"\"Fame Whore\" is crude, edgy and energetic, and its stars throw themselves into their roles with welcome gusto.\" The movie opened theatrically throughout the US and Europe, screening at Lincoln Center in NYC and running for 5 weeks in Los Angeles.\n\"Fame Whore\" was considered for an Academy Award in 1999, but it was rejected on a technicality because it had opened in Los Angeles in 16 mm, and at the time, all Academy Award considerations had to be shown in 35 mm.\n\nIn late 1999 Moritsugu started work on his next feature, \"Scumrock\", produced once again by Andrea Sperling. He stated: \"The original plan was for \"Scumrock\" to be a $2 million, 35mm picture. I thought it was totally do-able, what with the success of \"Fame Whore\". This budget proved to be elusive so we cut it down to $50,000. And alas, we ended up shooting \"Scumrock\" for $5,000 using a $150 camcorder.\" Starring Amy Davis (who also was co-writer and director of photography), James Duval (\"Frank the Bunny\" from \"Donnie Darko\"), and Kyp Malone (who would later join the band TV on the Radio), the movie was a deadpan comedy capturing the lives of fringe-art rebels dealing with the perils of turning 30 with little to show for their avant-gardness. After receiving a post-production grant from Creative Capital, the movie's footage was decimated and completely degenerated, Moritsugu's intent being to drag it into the gutter and destroy any sheen or aura of a \"pristine digital look.\" \"Scumrock\" was edited on a VHS cuts-only system and upon completion in 2002, it won the \"Best Feature\" Award at the Chicago Underground Film Festival, following that up with a \"Best Feature\" Award at the 2003 New York Underground Film Festival. It was selected by The Village Voice Film Critics Poll as \"Best of 2003\" and then opened theatrically in the US and Canada in 2004, receiving rave reviews from the Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly and E!.\n\nAfter \"Scumrock\", Moritsugu took a break from \"cinema,\" focusing on musical and other creative outlets and moving with Davis to Honolulu, Seattle, and finally Santa Fe.\n\nIn 2010, Moritsugu began production on his seventh feature, \"Pig Death Machine\". Starring Davis (who was also co-writer) and lensed by Todd Verow in digital video, the movie was shot in the wilds of New Mexico over 12 days with a small crew.\nIn spring 2011 and in the middle of \"Pig Death Machine\" post-production, Moritsugu directed with Davis a music video for the song \"No Future Shock\" by Brooklyn rock band TV on the Radio. As described by writer Rani Molla: \"Santa Fe filmmakers Jon Moritsugu and Amy Davis veer (very slightly) from their underground experimental base with a music video released today for popular Brooklyn experimental band TV on the Radio. The video is one in a movie-length series of music videos for the band's new album \"Nine Types of Light\"\". In 2012, the project received a Grammy Nomination in the \"Long Form Music Video\" category.\n\nIn 2013 \"Pig Death Machine\" premiered at the Chicago Underground Film Festival, where Moritsugu and Davis won the \"Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award.\" The movie screened at a number of US and international film festivals and also made it onto several \"Best Films of 2013\" lists including one compiled by critic Jack Sargeant. It then opened theatrically across America and also played with the Moritsugu retrospective of 7 features and 9 shorts in select cities including Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. \"Pig Death Machine\" received glowing reviews from the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and LA Weekly.\n\nIn 2015, Anthology Film Archives of New York City completed a two-year restoration project of Moritsugu's 1987 senior thesis film, \"Der Elvis\". With support from the National Film Preservation Foundation and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the movie was digitally scanned, remastered, reprinted in 16mm and described as, \"one of the most impressive and precocious student films ever made.\"\n\nLater that year, Moritsugu wrote and directed his first fashion video lookbook. Created for Mishka NYC's fall 2015 collection, the project was co-written and photographed by Davis and featured the music of Low on High.\n\nAlso in 2015, James Schamus, former CEO of Focus Features, stated to the \"New York Times\": \"Jon is a true cinema original. I'd rather be spit on by Jon than kissed by 95 percent of the directors out there.\"\n\nIn September 2016, an exhibition of seven Moritsugu features opened at the Ramiken Crucible in NYC. Entitled \"Semiotics of Sleaze,\" the movies were projected simultaneous on the gallery's walls for a one-month run. The Village Voice wrote: \"Jon Moritsugu's cinema is aggressive, abrasive, and it doesn't stop. His zero-budget movies have spastic editing, disorienting post-sync sound, and bright neon colors; they're a treat for the senses, and poison for the mind... While watching his films, you may feel tired, weak, or nauseous, but you will have had an experience, and a physical one at that – an effect to which many moving images can't lay claim... The gallery is showing these works simultaneously and blasting them at full volume; you'll feel the noise.\"\n\nIn August 2017, Moritsugu wrapped principal photography for his eighth feature, \"Numbskull Revolution\". Shot in New Mexico, the movie aims to \"satirize and deconstruct the high art scene in an eyeball-scorching onslaught of mind-blowing narrative madness and honey-laced pathos\".\" It stars James Duval as artist \"Futurecide\" and Amy Davis as twin sisters.\n\nMoritsugu landed a book deal in 2018 and is writing his memoir and completing post-production for \"Numbskull Revolution\".\n\nMoritsugu also fronted (1997–98) a punk band with Andy Matinog and Mike Masatsugu called No-No Boy after the novel by John Okada and is currently in a lo-fi indie garage rock band with Amy Davis called Low on High.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2075293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075293", "title": "García Sánchez I of Pamplona", "text": "García Sánchez I of Pamplona\n\nGarcía Sánchez I (Basque: \"Gartzea I.a Santxez\"; c. 919 – 22 February 970), was King of Pamplona from 925 until his death in 970. He was the second king of the Jiménez dynasty, succeeding his father when he was merely six years old.\n\nSon of Sancho I and Toda Aznárez, he succeeded his father in 925 when he was only six years old and reigned under the tutelage of his uncle Jimeno Garcés and of his mother, Toda. Three of García's sisters married kings of León: Urraca married Ramiro II; Oneca was the wife of Alfonso IV; and Sancha Sánchez was first married to Ordoño II. After Ordoño's death, she became the wife of Álvaro Herraméliz, Count of Álava, and after his death married Fernán González, Count of Castile. Another sister, Velasquita, married Munio Vélaz, who was Álvaro Herraméliz's predecessor as count of Álava. According to historian Gonzalo Martínez Díez, \"the intimate family ties of the Navarrese dynasty with the monarchs of León and with the counts of Castile and Álava, would be reflected in the battlefield where soldiers from Pamplona frequently fought side by side with the Leonese and Castilians against a common enemy, Islam\". Thanks to this web of alliances crafted by Queen Toda, Pamplona was able to increase its power and play a key role in the affairs of the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nUpon the death of his uncle and tutor, Jimeno Garcés, on 29 May 931, another uncle, Íñigo Garcés, half-brother of García's father, Sancho I, probably tried to become the regent of the kingdom and perhaps even usurp the throne, to the detriment of his nephew's rights. Both García and his mother Toda appear in a charter at the Abbey of San Pedro de Siresa on 9 March 933 without the royal titles. A year later, in May 934, the Caliph of Córdoba, Abd-ar-Rahman III, led a military expedition against King Ramiro II of León. The Caliph's original intention was to penetrate Castile, but he changed his plans when the Tujibid governor of Zaragoza, Muhammad ibn Hashim, refused to join forces. His armies first attacked the fortress in Maluenda and then ibn Hashim's fortress in Rueda de Jalón. When Abd-ar-Rahman was about to penetrate the Kingdom of Pamplona, he received an embassy from Toda asking him to withdraw his troops, and also reminding him of the family ties that bound them. The objective of Toda's embassy to his nephew Abd-ar-Rahman III could also have been to seek his protection for herself and her son and to have the Caliph \"expressly recognize her son, the young monarch García Sánchez I\". This would have secured García the crown in the face of possible counterclaims (such as Íñigo Garcés).\n\nAbd-ar-Rahman, who had never met his aunt, imposed the condition that she was to meet him at his camp in Calahorra \"as proof of the sincerity of her motives\". She accepted and went to meet him. As described by historian Ibn Hayyan, as part of the \"pact of submission and vassalage\", she was to submit to him and detach herself from the other Christian rulers, allies, relatives, and desist from supporting them and do nothing to hurt the Muslims. She was also to allow free passage to his armies through the Kingdom of Pamplona and had to liberate the Muslim hostages that she had as a pledge for a payment due to her. She consented to all of his demands and he, in turn, gave her son, García, Pamplona and all of its districts in investiture. She left on the same day taking with her the rich presents that he had given her. Shortly afterwards, the Muslim armies rapidly crossed the territory under the Pamplonese monarchy so as not to cause damage, and attacked the neighboring Álava and Castile, attacking the fortress in Grañón. They burned crops, chopped down fruit trees, and destroyed vineyards and buildings along the way.\n\nIn 937, King García allied himself with Ramiro II of León and Muhammad ibn Hashim, governor of Zaragoza, resulting in a military campaign by Abd-ar-Rahman III via Calatayud and Zaragoza into García's lands. He participated in July 939 in the Battle of Simancas alongside Ramiro II and Fernán González with the Christian armies defeating the caliphal forces. After this reversal, Abd-ar-Rahman III was planning another expedition for March 940 but suspended all plans when he received a messenger from Ramiro II to negotiate a truce. The Caliph, in response, also sent an envoy to the Leonese court for the negotiations. At about the same time or sometime before, he had also began talks with Sunyer, Count of Barcelona the result of which was a two-year truce. The accord, very advantageous for the Christians in commercial terms, included several conditions, one of which was the cancellation of the plans (or the annulment of the marriage) of King García with Count Sunyer's daughter. The peace negotiations between King Ramiro II and Abd-ar-Rahman III were not concluded until the summer of 941. The peace included \"all the frontier communities between the kingdoms of Leon and Pamplona, from Santarém to Huesca since Ramiro had a great interest in including García Sánchez I, the king who governed the destinies of the Pyrenean kingdom, rather than leaving him in the hands of Abd-ar-Rahman as the only Christian ruler remaining in a state of war with the Cordoban caliphate\".\n\nFollowing the death of Ramiro II and his successor Ordoño III of León, the Pamplona kingdom threw support behind the deceased king's younger brother, Sancho I of León, who was García's nephew. When García's brother-in-law, later also his son-in-law, and ally Fernán González of Castile switched his support and installed his own son-in-law Ordoño IV of León in place of Sancho, Fernán's relationship with García became strained and the death of Fernán's wife, García's sister Sancha the next year led to a break. García directly intervened in León, capturing Fernán and restoring Sancho. Fernán was forced to make territorial concessions to García to gain his release and their alliance wasn't fully restored until 964, when Fernán remarried, this time, García's daughter Urraca.\n\nHe died on 22 February 970 and was interred in the castle San Esteban de Deyo in Villamayor de Monjardín, Navarre.\n\nGarcía married his first cousin Andregoto Galíndez, daughter of Galindo Aznárez II, Count of Aragon and his wife Sancha Garcés. Given that Galindo Aznárez II did not have any legitimate male heirs, the rights to the County of Aragon passed down to Andregoto, and then to her first son with García Sánchez, as a county within the Kingdom of Pamplona.\n\nThe following children were born of this marriage:\n\nAndregoto was repudiated by her husband in 942. She retired to her lands in Aibar where she died sometime after June 971.\n\nThe King had reached an agreement to marry the daughter of Sunyer, Count of Barcelona, but the forced submission of Sunyer to Abd-ar-Rahman included the abandonment of this plan. By 943, García had married Teresa of León, daughter of his ally King Ramiro II of León and Adosinda Gutiérrez. They had the following children:\n\n\n"}

The band released their first single, a power ballad, \"I've Got a Lot to Learn About Love,\" for which they are perhaps most widely known. The song peaked at #6 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at #26 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe band featured three of Journey's former members (two of whom were founding members) – Gregg Rolie (original lead vocalist and keyboardist of Journey) on keyboards and lead & backing vocals, Ross Valory on bass and background vocals, and Steve Smith on drums. Kevin Chalfant, who had a #12 rock chart hit in 1982 as lead vocalist with AOR band 707, was the lead vocalist, and Josh Ramos (who cited Journey founder and guitarist Neal Schon as a major influence) was the lead guitarist. Ramos had previously replaced Journey guitarist Neal Schon in Hardline. Consequently, The Storm sounds very much like Journey to fans and critics alike.\n\nChalfant and Valory had just released an album together on another side-project band called The Vu and were ready for another venture; however, Rolie was the most instrumental in bringing the band together and sending them into a climb of success. He had collaborated on material with Kevin Chalfant and sent the track \"Show Me the Way\" to producer Beau Hill, who with Jimmy Iovine had just begun Interscope Records as a hard rock/AOR label for Atlantic Records president Doug Morris. Interscope became seriously interested in the project and signed the band, now known as The Storm, in 1990.\n\nThe Storm's debut album, self-titled and released in 1991 by Interscope, was produced by Beau Hill. It rose to #133 on the \"Billboard\" album chart, scoring two Mainstream Rock radio hits with the #6 “I’ve Got a Lot to Learn About Love” (which also reached #26 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100) and the #22 “Show Me the Way”.\n\nSteve Smith left the band in late 1991 and was replaced by Ron Wikso, who left Cher's band to become a full member of The Storm in early 1992.\n\nIn March 1992, the band embarked upon a US tour supporting Bryan Adams in arenas all over the country. They followed that up with a tour supporting Peter Frampton and did additional dates with Eddie Money, Tom Cochrane and others, in addition to several headlining dates.\n\nTheir follow-up album, \"Eye of the Storm\", was recorded for Interscope Records in 1993 but never released by Interscope. The previous year, the label—founded by Iovine (a producer, who began his career as a sound engineer for John Lennon and Bruce Springsteen) and Hill (noted for his success producing hard rock bands Ratt and Winger) as a rock label—had struck a deal to distribute releases by Death Row Records. Hits by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg convinced the label to shift its focus from Mainstream Rock to Gangsta Rap. \"Eye of the Storm\" was eventually issued through the major UK independent label Music for Nations in Europe, Avex Trax (Bareknuckle) in Japan and Miramar Records in the U.S. The album also appears on the iTunes Music Store with the release date of 1995.\n\nDespite the eventual release of \"Eye of the Storm\", the individual band members had moved on to other things. Gregg Rolie (keyboards) played with Abraxas Pool (featuring most of the original Santana members – himself, Chepito Areas, Michael Carabello, and Michael Shrieve – as well as Neal Schon and Alphonso Johnson). Ross Valory (bass) went on to a reformed Journey. Vocalist Kevin Chalfant, who sounded very much like Steve Perry, worked briefly with the reformed Journey, but was eventually replaced by Perry himself. Ron Wikso (drums) went on to play with David Lee Roth, Foreigner and Richie Sambora. Chalfant and Josh Ramos (guitar) formed another band called Two Fires, who released three albums, and later pursued solo careers, Chalfant making lead vocal stints in The Alan Parsons Project and the Kansas City AOR-based band Shooting Star.\n\nBeginning in late 1999, Gregg Rolie and Ron Wikso co-produced a solo CD for Gregg called \"Roots\" – released in 2001 on 33rd Street Records in the US and Sanctuary Records in Europe – and have since been touring together as part of the Gregg Rolie Band, which also features Michael Carabello, Adrian Areas, Kurt Griffey, Alphonso Johnson and Wally Minko. Ron Wikso occasionally rehearses with REO Speedwagon guitarist Dave Amato, and Styx bassist Ricky Phillips.\n\nFinal lineup\n\n\nFormer\n\n\n"}

Increasing restoration of theatre and cinema organs (such as the Wurlitzers) also allows current performances of many pieces that can only be played on theatre organs.\n\nRecitals appear to have arisen from playing before and after religious services. In 19th-century synagogues, organs appeared before their use in services was allowed; instead their purpose was to give concerts before the sundown Shabat service. Sweelinck's duties included the giving of extra-liturgical concerts in Amsterdam's Oude Kerk.\n\nPipe organs are not, in general, portable instruments. The venues for organ recitals using those instruments are thus the churches, theatres, or halls where the organs are housed. Some instruments of about a century ago were built to be listened to while strolling, such as those at the Wanamaker department store in Philadelphia or the museum of San Francisco's Palace of the Legion of Honor, which is not heard to best advantage from any one spot.\n\nHowever, with some organs the console is portable to a limited extent (such as, for example, being attached to a platform that can be raised or lowered, which is often the case for theatre organs, but less often the case for church organs, with some exception, like the Crystal Cathedral organ in California. Where this is the case, the console is moved for the recital so that the audience can see the organist playing.\n\nThe Wanamaker Organ is played twice daily, Monday through Saturday, free of charge, for patrons and those who visit Macy's Department Store in the Wanamaker Building in Philadelphia. The Grand Court Organist is Peter Richard Conte, and when he is touring, assistant organists perform to ensure the organ is played every day.\n\nThe Dane and Polly Bales Organ Recital Hall at the University of Kansas was specifically constructed for organ recitals.\n\nThe Harvard Organ Society holds regular organ recitals at the Adolphus Busch Hall.\n\nThe Temple Square Organ Recitals show off the organs in and around Temple Square, including the Salt Lake Tabernacle organ (most often in the Tabernacle) others are the LDS Conference Center organ and the Salt Lake Assembly Hall organ (occasionally). During the summer: Monday through Saturday noon and 2 pm. Sunday 2 pm. Non-summer: Monday through Saturday noon, and Sunday at 2 pm.\n\nTo show off its new concert organ, the Walt Disney Concert Hall held a series of organ recitals in 2004 and 2005. There is now a regular season of organ recitals at the venue featuring famous classical organists from around the world.\n\nIn Hollywood, California, the historic El Capitan Theater (also owned by the Disney company) showcases its Wurlitzer Organ regularly before its scheduled shows and movie showings. Organ recitals preceding Disney shows usually consist of Disney Favorites and Show Tunes, but well-known theater organ greats occasionally visit to do special shows at the theater, such as Bob Ralston of Lawrence Welk fame. Mr. Ralston also hosts organ recitals at his home in Granada Hills.\n\nAlso in California, the Orange County Theater Organ Society hosts frequent theater organ recitals at the Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton, featuring its own original Wurlitzer pipe organ from 1930. As part of its season, some of these recital programs also include a silent film accompanied by the theater organ, to provide a complete experience the way it was originally intended. A long list of accomplished organists regularly frequent the Plummer, including Chris Elliot and the inimitable Bob Ralston.\n\nWhile world-famous organist Frederick Swann was in residence at First Congregational Church in Los Angeles between 1998 and 2001, where he supervised the improvement of the organ to rival that of his former church, the Crystal Cathedral, to become the largest church organ in the world (with over 20,000 pipes), he instituted a music festival called \"Organ Alive!\" that featured organ recitals and concerts, collaborating with many renowned musicians to revive Los Angeles' organ music culture. The annual conference and organ series attracted people from all over the world to Los Angeles and continued in the years following Mr. Swann's retirement as principal organist of the church. Following the success of this recital series and the awareness that was revived in the city, two new significant pipe organs were commissioned in the city: that of the Disney Concert Hall and the Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (one block from Disney Hall).\n\nThe Los Angeles OLA Cathedral also holds weekly organ recitals on Wednesdays at 12:45 pm, following the noon mass. Follow the music link on the Cathedral's website for details on artists and programs.\n\nA performance of the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach was held on November 22, 2014 at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Manhattan. Twenty organists from The Juilliard School performed. Juilliard Organ Department Chair, Paul Jacobs, curated the eighteen-hour performance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2075315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075315", "title": "Tommaso Salvini", "text": "Tommaso Salvini\n\nTommaso Salvini (1 January 1829 – 31 December 1915) was an Italian actor.\n\nSalvini was born in Milan. His father and mother were both actors. His father was involved in the Bon and Berlaffa Company and the actor who was to play Pasquino fell ill. Instead of closing the theatre for the night his father asked the young Salvini to play the role. In his autobiography, he writes that \"when I perceived that some of Pasquino's lines were amusing the audience, I took courage, and, like a little bird making his first flight, I arrived at the goal, and was eager to try again … It is certain that from that time I began to feel that I was somebody.\"\n\nIn 1847 Salvini joined the company of Adelaide Ristori, who was then at the beginning of her career. It was with her as Elettra that he won his first success in tragedy, playing the title role in Alfieri's \"Oreste\" at the Teatro Valle in Rome.\n\nSalvini fought in the First Italian War of Independence in 1849, but otherwise devoted his life to acting.<br>\nIn 1853, however, he took a year off because \"he rarely felt adequately prepared for a role\". During this time, he prepared roles in great depth.\n\nSalvini's most famous role was Othello, which he played for the first time at Vicenza in June 1856. His other important roles included Conrad in Paolo Giacometti's \"La Morte civile\", Egisto in Alfieri's \"Merope\", Saul in Alfieri's \"Saul\", Paolo in Silvio Pellico's \"Francesca da Rimini\", Oedipus in Niccolini's play of that name, Macbeth and King Lear. The core of his acting method came from his studies. While visiting Gibraltar, for example, he spent time studying the Moors and found one particular man whom he based his Othello on. Instead of relying on a mustache, which was the traditional way of depicting a Moor, he tried to copy \"gestures, movements, and carriage\" to depict the character.\n\nSalvini acted frequently in England, and made five visits to the United States, his first in 1873 and his last in 1889. In 1886, he played Othello to the Iago of Edwin Booth. He always delivered his lines in Italian while the rest of the company spoke English (except during his first tour, when he had an Italian company). According to the New York \"World\" (27 October 1885), \"had he spoke Greek or Chocaw, it would have been much the same. There was that about him that was universal, and had he remained mute and contented himself with acting alone his audience could scarcely have failed to understand, so faithful was his portraiture of human instincts and their action\"\n\nSalvini's acting in \"Othello\" greatly inspired the young Russian actor Constantin Stanislavski, who saw Salvini perform in Moscow in 1882 and who would, himself, go on to become one of the most important theatre practitioners in the history of theatre. Stanislavski wrote that Salvini was the \"finest representative\" of his own approach to acting.\nSalvini retired from the stage in 1890, but in January 1902 took part in the celebration in Rome of Ristori's eightieth birthday. Salvini published a volume entitled \"Ricordi, aneddoti ed impressioni\" (Milan, 1895). Some idea of his career may be gathered from \"Leaves from the Autobiography of Tommaso Salvini\" (London, 1893). He died, aged 86, in Florence.\n\nSalvini was so confident in his talents as an actor that he was once quoted as saying, \"I can make an audience weep by reading them a menu.\"\n\nSalvini made at least one recording for Zonofono in 1902 of \"Il sogno\" from Saul. Listed in a contemporary Zonofono celebrity catalogue recently found.\n\nHis son Alessandro (aka Alexander Salvini) (1861–1896), also an actor, had several notable successes in America, particularly as d'Artagnan in \"The Three Guardsmen\". Another son, Gustavo Salvini, was a stage actor. Gustavo's sons, Tommaso's grandsons, were Alessandro Salvini (1890–1955) and Guido Salvini (1893–1965). Alessandro acted in movies dating back to silent pictures and Guido directed and wrote for films in the sound era.\n\n\n"}

Gartzez\"; c. 860 – 10 December 925), also known as Sancho I, was King of Pamplona from 905 until 925. He was the son of García Jiménez and was the first king of Pamplona of the Jiménez dynasty. Sancho I was the feudal ruler of the Onsella valley, and expanded his power to all the neighboring territories. He was chosen to replace Fortún Garcés by the Pamplonese nobility in 905.\n\nSancho Garcés was born around the year 860, son of García Jiménez and his second wife Dadildis de Pallars. Around the time of the death of King García Íñiguez he ruled the Onsella valley in the western part of the kingdom. He managed to take control of the city of Pamplona while Fortún Garcés was still king, aided by Alfonso III of Asturias and the Count of Pallars. Along with the Pamplonese nobility, they plotted to remove the king's children from the line of succession, which passed down to the king's granddaughter Toda, who was married to Sancho Garcés. He proclaimed himself King of Pamplona in 905.\n\nThroughout his reign, he involved himself in the squabbles among the Muslim lords to the south with repeated success. In 907, he turned on his former ally Lubb ibn Muhammad, killing him in battle. Four years later, another former ally, Galindo Aznárez, joined with his brother-in-law Muhammad al-Tawil and Abd Allah ibn Lubb ibn Qasi to attack Sancho, but they were defeated and neutralized as a threat. Al-Tawil fled and was killed shortly afterward, and the power of the Banu Qasi was severely crippled, while Galindo was forced into vassalage to Sancho, leading to the incorporation of the County of Aragon into the Pamplona kingdom. In 920, he teamed with Bernard I of Ribagorza and Amrus ibn Muhammed, son of Muhammad al-Tawil, to attack Banu Qasi-held Monzón. His successes allowed him to join Lower Navarre to his own dominions and extend his territory as far as Nájera. As a thanksgiving offering for his victories, in 924 he founded the monastery of San Martín de Albelda.\n\nHe died near the town of Resa, close to the Ebro river on 10 December, 925 and was buried in Villamayor de Monjardín. His son, García, was only seven years old, so Sancho was succeeded by his brother, Jimeno Garcés.\n\nSancho appears to have been the original king called by the byname \"Abarca\", though confusion among family members of the same name had led to it being instead applied to his grandson, Sancho II of Pamplona, by the 19th century. Sancho I gave rise to a dynasty that would rule several Iberian kingdoms, the last ruling until the 13th century, and the dynasty would be called the Banu Sanyo or the Banu Abarca by Al-Andalus scholars, denoting his role as founder.\n\nSancho Garcés was married to Toda Aznárez, daughter of the Count Aznar Sánchez and Onneca Fortúnez, herself being daughter of Fortún Garcés. According to the \"Códice de Roda\", they had one son, García, and five daughters, all of whom except Orbita married either kings of León or counts:\n\n\nOut of wedlock, he had a daughter, Lupa Sánchez, who was married to Dato II, Count of Bigorre, with whom she had one son, Raymond I, Count of Bigorre (940–956).\n\n"}

It is named for American explorer John C. Fremont who climbed the peak with Charles Preuss and Johnny Janisse from August 13 to August 15, 1842. Kit Carson had been with the climbing party on its first attempt at the peak, but had gone back for supplies the day Fremont and his men reached the summit. Carson is thought by some to have been the first to climb neighboring Jackson Peak. At that time, Fremont Peak was mistakenly thought to be the highest mountain in the Rocky Mountains, although there are actually over 100 higher peaks in the Rocky Mountain range.\n\nThe peak is located on the Continental Divide and is the second highest peak in the remote Wind River Range after Gannett Peak. The east flank of the peak is in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness of Shoshone National Forest, while the west side is in the Bridger Wilderness of Bridger-Teton National Forest. The Upper Fremont Glacier is located on the north slopes of the mountain.\n\nDue to the remote location and difficult ascent, most mountain climbers spend a total of three to five days hiking up to the mountain, climbing to the summit and then later hiking back to their starting point.\n\nEncountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.\n\nImportantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a misstep could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue.

It is named after Hermenegildo Galeana, a lieutenant involved in the country's movement towards independence. Galeana shares borders with the states of Coahuila and San Luis Potosí to the west; with the municipalities of Aramberri and Doctor Arroyo to the south; Rayones to the north; and with Linares, Montemorelos, Rayones and Iturbide to the east. Galeana is the largest municipality in the state, totaling 7,154.6 km², however it's scarcely populated with only 38,930 inhabitants resulting in a population density of 0.18 persons per square kilometer. Galeana, the municipal seat, is the best developed town in the region. It has services such as hospitals, accommodations, restaurants, bars and the largest drink distributor in the zone. However it remains as a low per-capita income city.\n\nClimate in Galeana is usually much colder than the rest of the state. In summer it is pleasantly cool and during winter, temperatures may reach down to -9°C. Annual average temperature is 17°C, and the average rain precipitation is around 446 mm. The winter cold blends with a noticeable lack of air humidity. Predominants winds comes from the north.\n\nThe main crop in Galeana is the potato, which is exported to different states and is also internationally shipped.\n\nThe municipality is known for its numerous tourist attractions. Probably the best known attraction is the \"Cerro del Potosí\" (Potosi's Mount), the highest mountain in the whole state, which rises over 3,600 meters above sea level. On the Rayones-Galeana highway lies El Puente de Dios (\"God's Bridge\"), a majestic natural archway that lies on top of a small creek. \"El Pozo del Gavilán\" is an enormous, deep natural cenote, where diverse species live.

{"id": "2075325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075325", "title": "MBTA Boat", "text": "MBTA Boat\n\nThe MBTA Boat system is a public boat service providing water transportation in Boston Harbor. It is operated by Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC) under contract to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The system consists of three routes that terminate in downtown Boston. F1 service runs from Rowes Wharf to Hewitt's Cove in Hingham. F2H service runs from Long Wharf to Hewitt's Cove, with some trips stopping at Logan Airport, Pemberton Point in Hull, and/or some of the Boston Harbor Islands. F4 service runs in the inner harbor between Long Wharf and the Charlestown Navy Yard. Two additional seasonal routes, not funded by the MBTA but included on some MBTA documents, run from Boston to Salem and Winthrop.\n\nIn the 19th century, numerous steamship routes ran from Boston to various destinations in the inner harbor, North Shore, and South Shore, plus routes to elsewhere in New England and to Europe. Ferry service declined in the late 19th century and 20th century due to competition from railways, streetcars, and finally automobiles; by the 1930s, only summer routes plus the East Boston ferry remained. Year round service to Hull was reintroduced in 1963, and was then the only commuter ferry service in the country. This was followed by Hingham service in 1975, tourist-oriented Charlestown service in 1979, and Quincy service in 1996 - as well as several other short-lived routes. Most routes were either unsubsidized or state-funded; from 1986 to 2002, they gradually became subsidized by the MBTA. Service to Quincy and Hull was combined in 1998; in 2013, the Quincy terminal was replaced by Hingham due to wharf damage.\n\nThe MBTA owns two ferries used on the F2H route; BHC owns ferries used on the F1 and F4 routes. The ferry system has the highest on-time performance and farebox recovery ratio of MBTA service types. However, it is only a small component of MBTA service: in 2014, the three MBTA-funded routes carried 5,070 passengers per weekday - about 0.3% of total MBTA ridership.\n\n\nBoat service between Boston and Charlestown ended in 1786 after the completion of the Charles River Bridge. The Winnisimmet Ferry to Chelsea ran until January 1917, with a brief revival starting on May 15, 1990 during early Big Dig construction. Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC) began tourist-oriented service, funded by the National Park Service, between Long Wharf and the Navy Yard in June 1979. In June 1987, this was switched to general-purpose ferry service funded by the Boston Redevelopment Authority. In October 1988, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works (DPW) began a four-year reconfiguration of the interchange between the Tobin Bridge and the Charlestown High Bridge. Charlestown ferry service was then increased, with funding from the DPW via the MBTA, and increased again in 1989. In 2004, the MBTA began directly funding the service.\n\nTwo additional routes - the F3 Lovejoy Wharf - Boston Navy Yard and F5 Lovejoy Wharf - World Trade Center via Moakley Courthouse - began operation in 1997 during Big Dig construction. They were discontinued on January 21, 2005 due to low ridership. The F5X Lovejoy Wharf - World Trade Center Express route was not funded by the MBTA and was run until February 24, 2006. A one-year pilot of a privately funded Lovejoy Wharf - Fan Pier route, intended mostly as a private employee shuttle, began in January 2019. It is overseen by the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority on behalf of private companies in the Seaport, rather than by the MBTA. The fare for public riders was substantially reduced in April 2019.\n\nFerry service to East Boston began in 1832 and lasted until 1952. City-run service ran from a wharf at Lewis Street to Long Wharf from 1995 to 1997; it was discontinued due to extremely low ridership (an average of 1.3 passengers per trip) as the Blue Line provided a faster and more frequent service along the same corridor.\n\nIn 2011, then-mayor Thomas Menino proposed ferry service between East Boston and Fan Pier on the South Boston Waterfront, a route without current direct transit service. In August 2012, the Federal Highway Administration awarded $1.28 million to the city for the purchase of two boats. In September 2012, the Boston Redevelopment Authority accepted the grant and agreed to rehabilitate the East Boston Marine Terminal for the ferries, which were then expected to begin operation in 2013. In August 2014, the MBTA opened bidding for providing the two boats for East Boston service.<ref name=\"IFB/RFP\"></ref> However, the grant was less than the actual cost of two boats, and plans for the service stalled.\n\n\nFerry service between Boston and Hingham began in 1832; after the South Shore Railroad began operation in 1849, ferries served largely recreational traffic rather than commuters. Service to Hull was added in 1848 (first Allerton Harbor, later Pemberton Point), and to Nantasket Beach in 1869. Service to the Hingham shipyard ended in 1898, though some service to Crow's Point lasted until 1923. Most of the Nantasket Boat Lines ferries were destroyed in a 1929 fire. The service was increasingly unprofitable to run; only summer service lasted past 1933. Hingham service ended in 1952; the last remains of Nantasket service ended in 1963. Massachusetts Bay Lines (MBL) restored year-round Pemberton Point - Boston service in March 1963 - then the only commuter ferry service in the country - followed by seasonal Nantasket service in 1964. Bay State Cruises took over the route in 1980. Paragon Park closed in 1985, and Nantasket service ended again in 1992. In 1996, Bay State Cruises sold the Hull route to Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC), who obtained an MBTA subsidy.\n\nRenewed Rowes Wharf-Hingham service began with a single round trip on October 6, 1975. The service was initiated by Ed King, then director of the Massachusetts Port Authority. Service was run by several operators, sometimes with state funding, most of the next eight years. In March 1983, Massachusetts Bay Commuter Services began eleven subsidized round trips (reduced to eight that June). The state began subsidizing eight additional round trips by Boston Harbor Commuter Services in 1984 during Southeast Expressway reconstruction. The MBTA began subsidizing service in 1986; after 1991, only Boston Harbor Commuter Services received a subsidy. In the 1990s, expanded ferry service was proposed as an alternative to the controversial return of commuter rail service on the Greenbush Line. Boston Harbor Cruises (which had briefly operated Hingham service in 1978) took over the Hingham-Boston service in 1997.\n\nIn 1996, Water Transportation Associates (WTA), doing business as Harbor Express, began service between Fore River Shipyard in Quincy and Long Wharf via Logan Airport. Two ferries and five years of operations were funded by then-shipyard owner General Dynamics. Quincy-Logan service began on November 18, 1996, with Long Wharf service added several weeks later. In 1998, the MBTA and BHC failed to reach a subsidy agreement. MBTA-subsidized Hull stops were added to several existing WTA Boston-Hingham trips. After the original funding ran out in 2001, the state funded service for the first half of 2002. In April 2002, the MBTA bought the WTA assets (two ferries, the Quincy terminal, and the Long Wharf lease); the WTA later won the contract to run the service. The MBTA designated the Hingham-Boston service as F1 and Quincy-Boston as F2, with trips serving Hull called F2H. Attempts in 2010 and 2011 to restore summer weekend service to Nantasket failed due to high fuel costs. On July 1, 2013, BHC took over Hingham services from WTA.\n\nQuincy service was temporarily discontinued on October 14, 2013, with boats redirected to Hingham, when a water main break added to existing structural problems with the sea wall at the Quincy wharf. In January 2014, the MBTA made the closure (and increased Hingham service) permanent after it was determined that repairs would cost $15 million for five years of additional service, or $50 million for 50 years. The damage also forced the closure of the \"USS Salem\" museum. Quincy proposed Squantum Point as an alternative terminal to maintain ferry service to the city. In July 2014, a neighboring shipyard purchased the Quincy site from the MBTA. The \"Salem\" was to be moved to East Boston in 2015; however, in February 2016 it was determined that it would stay in Quincy and eventually reopen. In 2019, Quincy submitted an application to the MBTA to establish Squatum-Logan-Boston service in 2020.\n\nWeekend summer service on the F2H route, last operated in 1998 and 1999, was introduced on May 24, 2014. The Hingham Intermodal Center was opened in January 2017, providing a larger waiting area and ticketing facilities. On January 2, 2018, ferry service to Hingham was indefinitely suspended due to ice damage to the dock during severe cold the previous week. Service resumed on January 15 after repairs to the dock.\n\nTwo summer-only routes to the North Shore are not funded by the MBTA but are included on MBTA maps:\n\nSteamboat service between Salem and Boston was run at various points between 1818 and 1931; because of competition from the Eastern Railroad, it was largely intended for recreation. Service to Winthrop was operated during several periods between 1840 and 1898; it too was largely out-competed by the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad for the commuter market. Lynn service was operated in the 1870s, and between 1892 and 1908. Ferry service between Boston and Salem was operated during the summer of 1998 by WTA, funded by a state grant. BHC ran unsubsidized service in the summers of 1999 and 2000. Salem service resumed on June 22, 2006, with a ferry funded largely by a $2.3 million state grant. It was operated by WTA during the summers of 2006 to 2011; BHC took over the service without subsidy in 2012. In 2009, Salem began allowing MBTA Commuter Rail passes to be used on certain peak-hour trips.\n\nWinthrop service, run by BHC under a three-year state grant, began on August 2, 2010 and lasted until 2012. A local charter operator ran some unsubsidized service in 2013. Service resumed on April 16, 2016 with a town-owned vessel operated by town employees. The Marina Bay stop (previously served by several short-lived services between 1977 and 1997) was added on August 16, 2016. The Boston terminal was at Fan Pier from April to June 2017, then Rowes Wharf (with an intermediate Fan Pier stop) for the remainder of the summer. Central Wharf became the Boston terminal in 2018. The service's high cost and low reliability has attracted criticism; it was not run for six weeks in 2019 due to mechanical issues and lack of staff.\n\nThe Lynn Ferry formerly operated from Lynn Ferry Terminal to Central Wharf. Service began on May 19, 2014 with three weekday round trips, as a two-year pilot program funded by the state. Fares were $3.50; MBTA Commuter Rail passes from Zone 2 or above were accepted for fares. Although the state spent $8.5 million on the terminal and $4.5 million in federal funds was secured for a larger ferry, the service was not run in summer 2016 due to lack of $700,000 in operations funding. Service resumed for June—September 2017 with funding from MassDOT, with one daily round trip timed for commuting. Fares were doubled to $7, and MBTA passes were not accepted. Due to low ridership in 2017 - just 30 daily passengers - the service was not resumed in 2018.\n\nAll MBTA-funded services are operated by Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC) under contract to the MBTA. The Salem route is also operated by Boston Harbor Cruises, but under contract to the town. It is the most reliable mode of MBTA service, with on-time performance typically above 95%. In 2014, the MBTA-funded portion of the system carried 5,070 passengers per weekday - about 0.3% of total MBTA ridership.\n\nUntil 2017, the MBTA owned two ferries, the \"Lightning\" and the \"Flying Cloud\", both built in 1996. They were largely replaced by the new catamarans \"Champion\" (named for \"Champion of the Seas\") in October 2017, and \"Glory\" (after \"Glory of the Seas\") in May 2018. The MBTA-owned ferries are used for the F2H route, while BHC-owned ferries are used for the F1 and F4 routes.\n\nMBTA Boat services have the highest farebox recovery ratio of any MBTA service type - 55% in 2012. However, the service still operated at a $5 million annual loss to the MBTA and carried a relatively small percentage of passengers, which resulted in calls for its discontinuance or modification. In 2012, facing a substantial budget gap, the MBTA proposed substantial service cuts and fare increases. All ferry routes were to be cut, resulting in $3.7 million savings for the agency. Temporary measures were found to avoid some service cuts including the ferries; however, weekend Quincy service was eliminated and fares raised 35% in an attempt to eliminate the subsidy required. State lawmakers also then proposed that Massport take over the ferries from the MBTA.\n\nBy 2014, farebox recovery increased to 62%. In 2018, the MBTA bid operation of all three routes in a single contract; BHC was the only bidder despite the MBTA's attempts to find a competitor. The cost was originally $17.2 million for the first year with annual increases (with the MBTA keeping all fare revenue); the MBTA negotiated the cost down to $13.6 million.\n\n"}

It is one of the most densely populated areas in Finland. Kallio (literally \"the rock\") is separated from the city centre by the Siltasaarensalmi strait, over which is a bridge called Pitkäsilta (\"long bridge\"). Traditionally, the bridge symbolizes the divide between the affluent centre and the more working class areas around Kallio.\n\nAfter the forming of the new centre in the 19th century, the city expanded northward. The intense industrialization which began in the 1860s in Helsinki saw the construction of the industrial areas around Sörnäinen harbour and to the workers' district of Kallio, with the area becoming inhabited mostly by factory workers. However, most of the working-class families have long ago been replaced as the most typical Kallio residents by young adults and elderly people living alone, in a process which could be seen as some sort of gentrification. For many people who move into Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland, Kallio is the area where they first settle. Most flats are small, and rents are typically lower than elsewhere in central Helsinki, partly explaining the area's popularity among students and artists. The small flat sizes also mean that Kallio is expected to resist full gentrification. However, the rents have increased as the district has grown more popular and become an increasingly desirable area to live in.\nKallio (and Harju, which is often considered a part of Kallio) also has, more than any other district in Helsinki, a reputation as a \"bohemian\" and liberal area. The area has a heterogeneous population and many bars. The area also has a number of sex shops, strip clubs and massage parlors.\n\nPresident Tarja Halonen was born in Kallio and lived there until she was elected president in 2000.\n\nFive SE-NW streets of Kallio are named with Finnish ordinal numbers: \"Ensi linja\", \"Toinen linja\", \"Kolmas linja\", \"Neljäs linja\" and \"Viides linja\", meaning \"First Line\", \"Second Line\", \"Third Line\", \"Fourth Line\" and \"Fifth Line\", forming thus an example of numbered streets, rare in Europe and unique in Helsinki.\n\nThe SW–NE streets in the same area are named after Finnish scientists from the 18th and 19th century. Starting from South-east these include:\n\nTo the east, the \"Torkkelinmäki\" area also has:\n\nMany of the streets on both sides of Helsinginkatu in the Kallio and Harju are named after Swedish kings and lords of the 16th and 17th century\n\n\n"}

NEPAD parents the E-School Program and is an economic program that aims to bring economic and social development to African nations and ensure 'Africa's Renewal'. The E-School Program began with Demonstration Projects and has developed further yet remains a work in progress in many countries, facing both criticism and support.\n\nThe E-School program was developed in 2003 at the African Economic Summit. The project aims to provide computers, internet access, and other Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to all schools in Africa within 10 years, under the NEPAD agreement. The main goal of the program is to expand students' ability to learn in schools through internet connection and technology access. The aim is to cover all high schools within 5 years of the start of implementation and all primary schools within 10 years, a total of some 600,000 schools. This is an initiative to provide more equality and access to education across African schools. The program does this by bringing techniques used elsewhere, ICT, to provide more academic opportunities for African children to succeed. NEPAD schools are unique from non-NEPAD schools in that they have significantly higher integration of ICTs, allowing children more opportunities for academic improvement. \n\nAt the World Economic Forum Africa Summit in Cape Town, it was announced that the first school to benefit from the program would be Bugulumbya Secondary School in the village of Busobya, Uganda. \n\nThe initial step in implementing the E-School Program the creation of 'Demonstration Projects' aimed to understand the most effective methods and the different situations which may be incurred along the implementation process. The main goals of these projects were to show \"the costs, benefits, appropriateness and challenges of a satellite based network\" which would be implemented under this program. These projects have been headed by \"the private sector partners... AMD, Cisco, HP, Microsoft and Oracle\". Each of these companies had a 'consortia' which contained other companies working on the initiative.\n\nSix schools from 16 African countries participated in these Demo Projects, but some (Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda) had much more investment into their programs than others. The Demo Project was only intended to last one year but faced challenges ,causing an extension. The project's aim was to discover the 'best practices' of implementing the program and how to do so most effectively. This demonstration project took place in 16 countries including: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda. The schools involved in the Demonstration Projects were also able to utilize the ICT early on in the preliminary test stages of the project. \n\nThere have been implementations of the NEPAD E-School program in Kenya. One study was done to compare the learning opportunities and resources of NEPAD secondary schools versus non-NEPAD secondary schools in Kenya. In this study, measures of the integration of the provided Information and Computer Technology (ICT) and the successes across six provinces in Kenya. The researchers selected six schools of each type (NEPAD and non-NEPAD) and used a questionnaire to determine the level of success of the schools within the recent past of the schools. They found that e-learning had been much more successful in application in NEPAD schools since students and teachers in E-Schools had better teacher support in utilizing e-learning than non-NEPAD schools.\n\nRwanda has seen growth in their school programs over the past two decades. Additionally, Rwanda was one of the nations which received ICT under a 'Demonstration Project' in 2006 which allowed a chance to utilize new technology in the growing school systems. But, one study uses examples from Rwanda to claim the objectives of the e-schools program have not been met. This study cites the nation's lack of ability to fund such an expensive program in a nation with a developing infrastructure. Many schools find it difficult to fully utilize the ICTs provided by the E-School program due to lack of funding, teacher training, and knowledge about the ICTs themselves. \n\nAs of 2012, not much change had been made towards the goal of the E-School Program. The countries which had the most initial investment in their schools by this program have seen the most success with the program. Many nations are still working to implement the program and utilize new ICT technologies in their school systems but have often found other obstacles, as mentioned above, in their way.\n\nPoor African nations are often unable to invest enough money into the program to make actual change. The program is costly and many nations in Africa do not have enough money or infrastructure to put adequate investment into the program. This was the case in Rwanda, which was unable to fully utilize the program's resources.\n\nThe program is not deemed a failure but has faced many obstacles in its implementation, common in social projects in Africa. In the aforementioned study done in Kenya, researchers found one of the largest downfalls of the implementation of ICT into African schools to be the lack of teacher support and resources. Teachers are given general technology training through this program. However, they often have no additional training responses once this training is complete. This can be resolved through more investment in educational infrastructure at the most basic levels such as teacher training and school funding.\n\nMany schools have also been critical of the post-demo project sustainability of the program. However, to combat this, the project and schools themselves have worked to create sustainability plans for the program and tweak the necessities of the plans. This was suggested in the Demonstration Project's initial roll out to provide a next step for E-schools. \n\n"}

{"id": "2075350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075350", "title": "Coligny calendar", "text": "Coligny calendar\n\nThe Coligny calendar is a Gaulish peg calendar or \"parapegma\" made in Roman Gaul in the 2nd century, giving a five-year cycle of a lunisolar calendar with intercalary months. It is the most important evidence for the reconstruction of an ancient Celtic calendar. It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals and is in the Gaulish language. The restored tablet contains sixteen vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over five years.\n\nIt was found in 1897 in France, in Coligny, Ain (, near Lyon), along with the head of a bronze statue of a youthful male figure. It is now held at the Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon-Fourvière. It was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that was originally wide by tall. Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the second century.\n\nA similar calendar found nearby at Villards d'Heria () is preserved in only eight small fragments. It is now preserved in the \"Musée d'Archéologie du Jura\" at \"Lons-le-Saunier\".\n\nThe Continental Celtic calendar as reconstructed from the calendars of Coligny and Villards d'Heria was a lunisolar calendar, attempting to synchronize the solar year and the lunar month.\nThe common lunar year contained 354 or 355 days.\n\nThe calendar year began with \"Samonios\" (\"samon\" is Gaulish for \"summer\", Lambert p. 112).\nLe Contel and Verdier (1997) argue for a summer solstice start of the year. Monard (1999) argues for an autumn equinox start (by association with Irish Samhain). As Irish \"Samhain\", Olmsted (1992, 2001: 20-21, 2009) corresponds to Irish Midwinter< Olmsted argues that \"Samonios\" (\"End of Summer Half of the Year\") began at actual midwinter (December 21) when the original 30-year Celtic calendar first originated around 1000 BC, but through a calendar error by one day every 199 years, after 1300 years of operation \"Samonios\" was pushd back to November 1 in its celebration.\n\nAs with the celebrations of the first day of spring, fall, summer, and winter, not just the days corresponding to the equinoxes and solstices have been displaced earlier by 55 days in Ireland, but the rituals corresponding to those found elsewhere in European and Indo-Iranian tradition, associated with the solar events, have been displaced as well. Such a displacement can be explained by a simple one-day shift every 23.7 years in the Celtic lunar calendar cycle and its associated IVOS festivals with respect to solar time. After some 1300 years of operation, such a calendar would have displaced the lunar festivals to some 55 days earlier than the actual solar events with which they were associated. With the adoption of Christianity the displaced festivals then became fixed points within the newly acquired Julian calendar. But even in this new calendar the festivals were not fixed points in the solar year. Thus after a similar span of 1600 years from its adoption, when Pope Gregory reformed the Julian calendar, it had become 12 days out of sync with solar time.\n\nBesides the Coligny calendar plate, Classical commentary provides a few important details about early Celtic calendar cycles. Diodorus Siculus (V, 32, 6; Tierney 1960), quoting Posidonius, describes a sacrifice which took place significantly every five years among the Gauls, presumably at midsummer, since first fruits and animals were burnt in pyres (Zwicker 1934: 19). Plutarchus (Moralia, de facie in orbe Lunae: 26, 941 A) refers to a festival or expedition every 30 years undertaken in the Islands off Britain, presumably the Channel Islands, but perhaps the comment on Hesíodos refers to islands to the west of Britain and might relate to Ireland. Plutarchus's 30-year festive or expeditionary cycle near Britain may relate to the same 30-year cycle as that referred to among the Gauls by Plinius, writing ca. 75 A.D. but apparently quoting an earlier source (Naturalis Historia, XVI, 250).\n\"The sixth day of the new moon ... marks for them [the druids] the beginning of the months, the years, and the cycle at the end of thirty years, because by this time it [the moon] has considerable strength though not yet at the halfway point.\" (Zwicker 1934: 55).\n\nThus classical commentary, probably most of it emanating from Posidonius at the end of the second century BC, describes both a 5-year phase, the time interval between the recurring midwinter or midsummer intercalary months, and a 30-year cycle as current among the Gauls and possibly among the British or Irish as well. One very important aspect of Plinius's statement is that both the year and the 30-year cycle begin on the same fixed day of the moon. For the 30-year cycle to begin on the same fixed day of the moon, the 30-year period must contain exactly 371 lunar months or 10956 days (actually 10955.848 days with 29.5306 days per lunar month), 1 day less than 30 solar years (10957.266 days) (see Table 4). Thus, as we shall see, Plinius can only be describing the calendar which must have been the predecessor to the 25-year Coligny calendar (Olmsted 1992: 61-64, 132-134; Olmsted 2001: 1; Duval and Pinault 1986: 415). On the Coligny calendar the term ATENOVX \"returning night\" dividing each month into two halves counting from days I to XIIII or XV as well as the N-counting scheme alongside the TII-counting scheme shows that the 25-year Coligny calendar clearly developed from an earlier fully-lunar calendar. The addition of an extra day making the month Equos have 29 rather than 28 days in year 4 of each 5 year phase causes the calendar to shift from a 30-year cycle which contains 10956 days to a 25-year cycle which contains 9130 days. \nTo total 10956 days, Plinius's 30-year calendar must contain an 1801-day phase (61 lunar months) followed by five 1831-day phases (62 lunar months) (see plate 3). In this 30-year cycle, since 5 solar years contain 1826 days, during the first 5-year phase (1801 days) the sun falls back 25 days. However, the sun gains back 5 days in each of the next five 5-year phases (which contain 1831 days, 5 days longer than the 1826 days of 5 solar years) (Olmsted 1992: 106). Thus the intercalary summer and winter solstices progress at 5-day intervals every 5 years. In contrast, the 25-year Coligny calendar contains an 1802-day phase followed by four 1832-day phases. Since a 5-year period with four 365-day years and one 366-day year contains 1826 days, the sun would initially lag behind the 25-year calendar by 24 days (1826 -1802) after the first 5-year phase. However, the sun would gain back this initial lag by 6 days for each of the four subsequent 5-year phases (1832 - 1826). This calendar realigns to within one day of solar time every 25 rather than every 30 years. Containing 9130 days, this 25-year calendar then runs almost exactly 1 day less than the 9131.06 days to be found in 25 solar years and almost exactly 5 days more than the 9124.95 days to be found in 309 lunar months, equivalent to the 5-day week, the cóicde, of the early Irish law tracts (see Olmsted 1992: 95). \n\nIndeed, the Coligny calendar indicates which 5-day lunar week reigns over each subsequent 25-year cycle through a series of marks (TII, ITI, IIT), which also indicate the one-day lag of the sun with each 25-year cycle (see plate 1). TII indicates that the first lunar week begins each month during the first 25 year of operation. ITI indicates that the second lunar week begins each month during the period between year 26 and year 50. IIT indicates that the third lunar week begins each month during the period between year 51 and year 75 from the inception of the calendar. If the first winter solstice begins on day 1 of year 1, the solstice will begin on day 2 in year 26 and on day 3 in year 51. These marks in this sequence (TII, ITI, IIT), except where shifted or exchanged with other days (Olmsted 1992: tab. 6c), are found in groups of three days in a row, each group separated by the 6 days the sun, in each 5-year phase, gains back the initial fall-back of 24 days from the first 5-year phase (Olmsted 1988: tabs. 6-7; 1992: tabs. 34, 41, 43; p. 144). In this 25-year calendar the two summer and winter intercalary solstices which occur every 5 years (separated by 30 months) progress at 6-day intervals rather than the 5-day intervals they progress in the 30-year calendar. \nAfter 1300 years the actual lunar festivals associated with the solstices and equinoxes will take place on average 54 days ahead of the sun (Olmsted 1992: 130-134; tab. 57). If the Julian calendar was adopted with Christianity around 450 AD, this would give a date of around 850 BC for the beginning of a 30-year pagan Irish calendar, if such existed. But there is nothing exact in this date because of the natural oscillation of the lunar and solar dates caused by the intercalary months and the 11-day difference between the lunar and solar year. This oscillation gives a wide margin of error of + 300 years. Thus from the evidence of the 55-day displacement of the Irish festivals, we might assume that somewhere in the period 550 BC to 1150 BC the original 30-year Celtic calendar cycle was adopted. However, there is another source for dating the origin of the 30-year calendar. The agreement of these two sources then puts our dating on a more solid footing.\nThe entry \"three-nights of Samonios today\") on the 17th of Samonios suggests that, like the Irish festival of Samhain, it lasted for three nights. The phrase *\"trinoxtion Samonii\" is comparable to a Gaulish festival mentioned in a 1st-century AD Latin inscription from Limoges, France, which mentions a \"10 night festival (*\"decamnoctiacon\") of (Apollo) Grannus\" ( ). Olmsted (2001: 26, 40) indicates that TRINOUX SAMO is actually an abbreviation for TRI(TIO)NOUX \"the Third Night of Samonios\", just as (PETIUX RIVROS is an abbreviation for\nPET(UOR)I(NO)UX RIVROS \"the fourth night of \"Rivros\". Both of these days are displaced by the transference of lucky MAT days into unlucky ANMAT months. Their original positions are indicated by the ordinal numerals \"TRI(TI)- and PET(UOR)I-.\n\nThe solar year was approximated by the insertion of a 13th intercalary month every two and a half years. The additional months were intercalated before \"Samonios\" in the first year, and between \"Cutios\" and \"Giamonios\" in the third year. The name of the first intercalary month is not known with certainty, the text being fragmentary.\nIn a suggestion first made by Schmidt (1979:198),the name of the first intercalary month is probably \"Quimonios\", found in the final verse of the gnomic line at the end of the month, , emended to \"Three hundred eighty and five are given this year through Quimonios\" (\"Quimon-\" abbreviating the io-stem dative \"Quimoniu\").\nThe name of the second intercalary month is reconstructed as \"Rantaranos\" or \"Bantaranos\", based on the reading of the fifth line in the corresponding fragment.\nA gnomic verse pertaining to intercalation was taking up the first two lines, read as . The term \"\" is interpreted as \"sun's march\" = \"a year\" by Delamarre (2003).\n\nThe months were divided into two halves, the beginning of the second half marked with the term \"atenoux\" or \"renewal\" (cf. Old Irish \"athnugud\" \"renewal\"). The basic unit of the Celtic calendar was thus the fortnight or half-month, as is also suggested in traces in Celtic folklore. The first half was always 15 days, the second half either 14 or 15 days on alternate months (similar to Hindu calendars).\n\nMonths of 30 days were marked \"MAT\", months of 29 days were marked \"ANM(AT)\".\nThis has been read as \"lucky\" and \"unlucky\", respectively, based on comparison with Middle Welsh \"mad\" and \"anfad\", but the meaning could here also be merely descriptive, \"complete\" and \"incomplete\".\nThere is no indication of any religious or ritual content.\nThe Coligny calendar as reconstructed consisted of 16 columns and 4 rows, with two intercalary months given half a column (spanning two rows) each, resulting in a table of the 62 months of the five-year cycle, as follows (numbered 1–62, with the first three letters of their reconstructed names given for ease of reference; intercalary months are marked in yellow):\n\nIn spite of its fragmentary state, the calendar can be reconstructed with confidence due to its regular composition. \nAn exception is the 9th month \"Equos\", which in years 1 and 5 is a month of 30 days but in spite of this still marked \"ANM\".\nMacNeill (1928) suggested that \"Equos\" in years 2 and 4 may have had only 28 days, while Olmsted suggested 28 days in year 2 and 29 days in year 4.\n\nThe following table gives the sequence of months in a five-year cycle, with the suggested length of each month according to Mac Neill and Olmsted:\n\nThe total of 1831 days is very close to the exact value of 62 × 29.530585 = 1830.90 days, keeping the calendar in relatively good agreement with the synodic month (with an error of one day in 50 years), but the aim of reconciling the lunar cycle with the tropical year is only met with poor accuracy, five tropical years corresponding to 5 × 365.24219052 = 1826.21 days (with an error of 4.79 days in five years, or close to one day per year).\n\nAs pointed out already by Ricci (1898), based on the mention of a 30-year cycle used by the Celts in Pliny's \"Naturalis historia\" (book 16), if one intercalary month is dropped every thirty years, the error is reduced to 30 – (6 × 4,79) = 1.27 days in a 30-year period (or a shift of the seasons by one day in about 20 to 21 years).\nThis proposed omission of the intercalary month once in 30 years also improves the accuracy of the lunar calendar, assuming 371 lunations in 10,956 days, or an assumed synodic month of = 29.53010 days, resulting in an error of one day in 195 years.\n\nSteinrücken (2012) has proposed that Pliny's statement that the Celtic month begins on the sixth day of the month may be taken as evidence for the age of this system: assuming that the month was originally aligned with lunations, a shift of five days corresponds to a period of 975 years, suggesting a starting date in the 10th century BC. Omsted (1992) in a similar argument proposes an origin around \n\"850 ± 300 BC\".\n\nIn the Coligny calendar, there is a hole in the metal sheet for each day, intended for a peg marking the current date.\nThe middle of each month is marked \"atenoux\", interpreted as the term for the night of the full moon.\n\nThere is an additional marker \"prinni loudin\" in 30-day months (\"MAT\"), at the first day of the first month (Samonios), the second day of the second 30-day month, and so on. The same system is used for 29-day months (\"ANMAT\"), with a marker \"prinni laget\". In Olmsted's interpretation, \"prinni\" is translated \"path, course\", \"loudin\" and \"laget\" as \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\", respectively, in reference to the yearly path of the Sun, \"prinni loudin\" in \"Samonios\" marking summer solstice and \"prinni laget\" in \"Giamonios\" marking winter solstice.\n\nThe following table shows the arrangement of a complete month (\"Samonios\" of year 2, with marked on the 17th day). This is the only month out of 62 that has been preserved without any gaps.\n\nEach month is divided into two half-months or \"fortnights\", divided by the word \"atenoux\". Within each half-month, the arrangement is tabular, beginning in the first column with the Roman numeral of the day of the half-month (with the hole \"◦\" for the peg marking the current day indicated as a circle). \nIn the second column are occasional \"trigrams\" of the form +II, I+I or II+, and sometimes the letter M, of unknown significance. \nIn a third column, each day is marked by the letter N or D (excepting days marked as \"prinni loudin\" or \"prinni laget\"). In the final column, days are marked with additional information, such as IVOS,\nINIS R,\nAMB (only found on odd days), among others.\n\nIn the month \"Samonios\" depicted above, the 17th day is marked TRINVXSAMO, corresponding to TRINOSAM SINDIV in \"Samonios\" of year 1.\n\nThe name of the following month, DVM(AN), is mentioned several times (on days 1, 3, 8 and 16). Conversely, the following month marks days 1, 8, 16 and 17 with SAMON(I). This \"exchanging of days\" in odd months with the following, and in even months with the preceding month is also found in other parts of the calendar.\n\nThe names of the twelve months as recorded are 1 \"samon-\", \n2 \"dumann-\", 3 \"riuros\", 4 \"anagantio-\", 5 \"ogronn-\", 6 \"cutios\", 7 \"giamoni-\", 8 \"simiuisonna-\", 9 \"equo\", 10 \"elembiu-\", 11 \"edrini- / aedrini-\", 12 \"cantlos\". \nSeven of these names have no clear etymology. The five month-names that do have language cognates are \"samon-\" and \"giamoni-\", which are the stems of the words for \"summer\" and \"winter\", respectively; months \"equos\" and \"cantlos\" might associated with Celtic words for \"horse\" and \"song\", respectively; and the name \"ogronn-\" is interpreted by Birkhan (1997) as a word for \"cold\".\n\nThe names of the twelve regular months can be reconstructed with some certainty in spite of the fragmentary state of the calendar, as each of them was repeated five times. The two intercalary months occur only once each, and their names are consequently reconstructed with much less certainty.\nThe name \"Quimonios\" is obtained from reading the very end of the first segment as QVIMON, The reconstucton of either \"*Rantaranos\" or \"*Bantaranos\" is based on reading [.]ANTARAN in the fifth line of the 32nd segment. Olmsted (1992) gives a tentative explanation of \"*Rantaranos\" as \"the count in between\".\n\n"}

Young's father died when he was young, which required him to care for his mother and younger sister.\n\nA resident of Pawtucket, Rhode Island when the American Civil War started in April 1861, Young was eager to serve in the Union Army. With his sister, who was only ten years old at the time, driving a carriage for him, and a book of tactics open on his knee, he went from house to house, through the villages of Blackstone Valley. Stopping in public places and calling a crowd around his carriage, he harangued them with such patriotic ardor that in one day he enlisted sixty-three men for the Union Army.\n\nOn June 6, 1861, at the age of 20, Young enlisted in the Union Army as a private in the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry. Although only 5 feet 2 inches tall, Young proved to be a natural leader and a fierce fighter.\n\nYoung fought with his regiment at the Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861. He was promoted to 2nd lieutenant the next day in recognition of his heroism during the battle and was again promoted to first lieutenant in November of that same year. Young would later fight in the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Salem Heights.\n\nOn April 30, 1863, Young was promoted to captain and was assigned as an Acting Assistant Inspector General at the brigade headquarters. As this was an administrative position, it disagreed with Young as he desired to return combat service. He held this position until he was promoted to major in November 1864 and reassigned as an acting aide-de-camp and chief of scouts to Major General Philip Sheridan, commander of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac.\n\nYoung commanded a 58-man scout band, popularly called the \"Jessie Scouts\", under General Sheridan in the final months of the war. The Jessie Scouts employed irregular warfare tactics, such as wearing enemy uniforms, and provided long range reconnaissance behind enemy lines. Other activities included tapping telegraph wires and misdirecting supply trains.\n\nYoung was noted for his ability to disguise himself as either a Confederate soldier or civilian and move unnoticed in Confederate camps gathering intelligence. By infiltrating the enemy in disguise he was legally considered a spy and could have been lawfully executed if captured by the Confederates.\n\nAmong Young's notable exploits was the capture of Confederate Colonel Harry Gilmor on February 4, 1865. Gilmor was the leader of raiding detachment whose capture was considered critical to General Sheridan. Young, along with several of his scouts, disguised themselves as Confederate soldiers and told individuals who knew Gilmor they needed to see the colonel. When provided with Gilmor's location, Young went to the house and captured Gilmor in bed at gun point. Young then escorted him to the prison for Confederate officers at Fort Warren in Boston, Massachusetts, where Colonel Gilmor was delivered on February 10, 1865.\n\nYoung was breveted to lieutenant colonel of Volunteers in March 1865, shortly before he was mustered out of service four months later.\n\nColonel Young was mysteriously killed in late 1866 while crossing the Rio Grande. He was with a group of veteran soldiers on their way to serve as a bodyguard for Mexican General Mariano Escobedo who was allied with Mexican president Benito Juarez against Emperor Maximilian.\n\nUpon hearing of Young's death, General Sheridan wrote \"\"Major Young’s record during the war, if the details could be gathered, would be of more interest than any romance of war ever written. I shall always remember him with pride and affection.\"\"\n\nA statue named \"The Scout\" was erected in his honor at Burnside Park in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. This statue is probably a figurative representation of Young rather than literal one as the statue figure wears the uniform and accouterments of a Cavalry soldier whereas Young was an officer in the Infantry.\n\n\n"}

The song is the fifth track on the band's debut album, \"Ten\" (1991). Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard.\n\nAfter \"Ten\" became a commercial success in 1992, Pearl Jam's record label Epic Records urged the group to release the song as a single. The band refused, citing the song's personal nature. Despite the lack of a commercial single release, the song managed to reach number three on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Remixed versions of the song were included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, \"Rearviewmirror\", and the 2009 \"Ten\" reissue. It has gone on to become one of the band's most popular songs, as well as a fan favorite.\n\nThe song originated as an instrumental demo under the name \"E Ballad\" that was written by guitarist Stone Gossard in 1990. It was one of five songs compiled onto a tape called \"Stone Gossard Demos '91\" that was circulated in the hopes of finding a singer and drummer for Pearl Jam. The tape made its way into the hands of vocalist Eddie Vedder, who was working as a San Diego gas station attendant at the time. Vedder recorded vocals for three of the songs on the demo tape (\"Alive\", \"Once\", and \"Footsteps\"), and mailed the tape back to Seattle. Upon hearing the tape, the band invited Vedder to come to Seattle. On his way to Seattle, Vedder wrote lyrics for \"E Ballad\", which he called \"Black\".\n\nGuitarist Mike McCready on the song's lead guitar work:\nThat's more of a Stevie [Ray Vaughan] rip-off, with me playing little flowing things. I was way into that trip—I still am, actually, but it was probably more obvious back then. I really thought the song was beautiful. Stone wrote it and he just let me do what I wanted.\n\nVocalist Eddie Vedder on the song's lyrics:\nPearl Jam's Eddie Vedder had been a fan of American Music Club for years. Pearl Jam's song 'Black', \"Melody Maker\"'s All Jones maintains, \"couldn't have been written without AMC's songs as an example. 'Black' doesn't quote directly from 'Western Sky,' but it paraphrases the line 'Please be happy baby' where Vedder sings in a very Eitzel way, 'I hope someday you'll have a beautiful life'.\" Vedder confirmed Jones' interpretation when they first met. \"Oh yes, nobody ever picked up on that,\" the singer told him. \"It is American Music Club, but I'm surprised that anyone here has even heard of them.\"\n\n\"Black\" became one of Pearl Jam's best-known songs and is a central emotional piece on the album \"Ten\". Despite pressure from Epic Records, the band refused to make it into a single, citing it as too personal and expressing fear that its emotional weight would be destroyed in a music video. Vedder stated that \"fragile songs get crushed by the business. I don't want to be a part of it. I don't think the band wants to be part of it.\" Vedder personally called radio station managers to make sure Epic had not released the song as a single against his wishes. In spite of this, the song charted at number three on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 20 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1993.\n\nStephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork Media said, \"On songs like...'Black,' with strangely dramatic vocalizations, there's a hardscrabble dynamic that the band would be unable to capture on subsequent releases.\"\n\nIn March 2009, \"Black\" was made available as downloadable content for the \"Rock Band\" series as a master track as part of the album \"Ten\". The song was featured in the \"Cold Case\" episode \"Into the Blue\" in 2009.\n\nIn May 2011, \"Black\" was voted the 9th Best Ballad of All Time by readers of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine.\n\n\"Black\" was first performed live at the band's October 22, 1990 concert in Seattle, Washington at the Off Ramp Café. Pearl Jam performed the song for its appearance on \"MTV Unplugged\" in 1992. Live performances of \"Black\" can be found on the \"Dissident\"/\"Live in Atlanta\" box set, the live album \"Live on Two Legs\", various official bootlegs, the live album \"Live at Benaroya Hall\", the \"Live at the Gorge 05/06\" box set, and the \"Drop in the Park\" LP included in the Super Deluxe edition of the \"Ten\" reissue.

Just to the west of the fort was a small Romano-British town, believed to be that listed in the Antonine Itinerary as \"Vindocladia\".\n\nIn 1983 Shapwick was used as one of the two real life locations for the \"Doctor Who\" story \"The Awakening\". The other village used was Martin in Hampshire.\n\nOne of its most famous residents was Charles Bennett who won the 1500 metres at the 1900 Summer Olympics.\n\nA local legend tells how in the year 1706 a travelling fishmonger was one day passing through the village of Shapwick, when, unbeknownst to the fishmonger, a crab fell off his cart. The fishmonger continued on his journey, but the local villagers, who had never seen a crab before, gathered around the creature poking it with sticks believing it to be a devil or monster. The fishmonger (according to one version of the story) eventually returned looking for his lost crab, and when he saw the commotion, picked up the crab and continued on his way to spread the story about the simple folk of Shapwick.\n\nThe story was cemented in verse and pictures in 1841 by the artist Buscall Fox, and today the legend is commemorated on a story board on display at the Anchor Inn, and also in the name of Crab Farm, which has a weathervane showing the crab and villagers.\n\n"}

Many of the facilities there were originally built by Will Keith Kellogg of Kellogg's cereal, after whom the station is named. KBS includes nearly 16.5 square kilometres of land and, together with nearby state lands and preserves, allows for large-scale studies by biologists. The National Science Foundation has a Long-Term Ecological Research site at KBS.\n\nKBS offers classes to undergraduate and graduate students in biology-related fields, including the Enhancing Linkages between Mathematics and Ecology (ELME) program, which consists of three weeks of mathematics and four weeks of field work.\n\nA prominent feature of the Biological Station is W.K. Kellogg’s Manor House. It is located at 3700 E. Gull Lake Drive, Hickory Corners, Michigan. Situated above Gull Lake, it has spectacular lake views.\n\nThe Manor House was designed by the architectural firm of Benjamin and Benjamin. Built in 1925, the Manor House served as a summer home for W.K. Kellogg and his second wife Dr. Carrie Staines. They lived there until 1942. Designed in a Tudor revival inspired style. It has leaded glass bay windows, oak coffered ceilings and Rookwood tile bathrooms and fireplaces. The estate also includes a Carriage house, green house with potting shed, a caretaker's cottage, boathouse, an authentic Dutch windmill and several beautiful gardens.\n\nKellogg then gave permission for the house to be used by the Coast Guard as an induction and training center. With the end of World War II a need for rehabilitation centers arose. As the number of wounded soldiers rose, the Manor House was converted into an estate for injured veterans. In 1951 ownership of the estate changed hands. Upon Mr. Kellogg’s death, the Manor House and its surrounding land was given to Michigan State University. From the and outbuildings the Kellogg Biological Station was formed. The Manor House was recently restored to its original grandeur and is now open for tours. The two-story home is now used for conferences and weddings.\n\nIn 1998 a grant was given by the Kellogg Foundation to restore the Manor House to its original state.\n\nA popular destination at the biological station is the Bird Sanctuary. Modeled after a similar wildlife refuge in Canada, the Bird Sanctuary is home to many wild birds and waterfowl, including trumpeter swan, Canada geese, diving and dabbling ducks, herons, cranes, songbirds, and more. The Sanctuary has been an integral part in re-establishing both Canada goose and trumpeter swan populations to the Midwest, serving as an important flyway stop for migrating birds. The Sanctuary also houses captive birds of prey and game birds on-site. Originally opened as a refuge in 1927, the sanctuary was donated to the Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (now Michigan State University) in 1928 to be used for research and education. The Sanctuary remains a popular stop for visitors, offering tours, courses and programs to the public year-round.\n\n7060 N. 42nd St., Augusta. Established on abandoned agricultural land in 1932, the 716-acre Forest is known worldwide for research on tree breeding and genetics, planting techniques, and plantation establishment and management. Much of the research that developed the Spartan spruce, a hybrid that combines the color and drought resistance of a blue spruce and the softer needles and rapid growth rate of the white spruce, was done at the Kellogg Forest. The forest is open to the public for biking, hiking, jogging, horseback riding and cross-country skiing and also has more than 15 miles of interpretive trails. Bow hunting, trout fishing and picnicking also are permitted.\nAn MSU branch library, also known as the Gull Lake Library, is part of Michigan State University's W.K. Kellogg Biological Station. The Gull Lake Library contains over 12,000 volumes, many of which are bound journal volumes. Nearly 150 current serial titles are received. The collection supports the research interests of KBS faculty, staff, students and visiting scientists in aquatic and terrestrial ecology, evolution, behavior and agro-ecology.\n\nThe first director of the station, Dr. Walter F. Morofsky, was an entomologist with MSU. Today the library has a strong historical entomology collection. Early Bird Sanctuary research and teaching led to a good waterfowl collection. Once the year round research station was established in 1965, and the branch library was established, a strong research program in limnology was begun, which continues to this day. Currently, there are strong research programs in limnology, microbial ecology, plant ecology, agricultural ecology, fish ecology and vertebrate behavioral ecology.\n\n"}

It is situated to the west of Glastonbury.\n\nShapwick is the site of one end of the Sweet Track, an ancient causeway dating from the 39th century BC.\n\nIn 1998 a hoard of 9,238 silver denarii (the second largest hoard ever found from the Roman Empire, and the largest in the United Kingdom) was discovered in the remains of a previously unknown Roman villa near Shapwick. Following a Treasure Inquest in Taunton, the hoard was valued and acquired in its entirety by Somerset County Museums Service for the sum of £265,000. It became known as the Shapwick Hoard.\n\nThe parish of Shapwick was part of the Whitley Hundred.\n\nDue to the plan of its roads and streets academics have described it as a \"typical English village\". Shapwick is one of the nine Thankful Villages in Somerset — those that suffered no casualties in World War I.\n\nThe manor of Shapwick originally belonged to Glastonbury Abbey, forming part of its Pouholt (Polden) estate in 729. It was divided into two halves in medieval times. After the Dissolution of the monasteries the manor passed to Thomas Walton and then to the Rolle family.\nShapwick House was built by Sir Henry Rolle in 1630 in place of the original manor house. The property was sold in 1786/7 by Denys Rolle (1725-1797) of Stevenstone in Devon, to George Templer (1755-1819) of the East India Company 4th son of James I Templer (1722–1782) of Stover, Teigngrace. Shapwick House is a Grade II* listed building and is now an hotel.\n\nThe manor house (Shapwick Manor, previously known as Down House) was built after the manor was split. It dates from around 1475; originally it was moated but the moat was filled in during the rebuilding by Henry Bull in the first quarter of the 17th century. Shapwick Manor is also a Grade II* listed building. \n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, highways, public transport, fire service, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. Policing is provided by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.\n\nIt is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.\n\nShapwick Heath is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and national nature reserve It is a former raised bog lying in the basin of the River Brue. The site supports a diverse community of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates. National rarities are the large marsh grasshopper (\"Stethophyma grossum\") found on sphagnum moss bogs, the greater silver diving beetle (\"Hydrophilus piceus\") and the lesser silver diving beetle (\"Hydrochara caraboides\") which is now confined nationally to the Brue Basin Peat Moors.\n\nThe adjoining Shapwick Moor has been purchased by the Hawk and Owl Trust and will be their first reserve in south west England. The land will be farmed traditionally in order to recreate the habitats of the past. The management plan for the site is being overseen by Natural England. The first steps in the creation of the nature reserve are to reseed the land and then reintroduce Devon ruby red cattle to the site. The priority is to encourage wildlife, not human visitors and there will be no visitor centre or permanent structures, but a public footpath which crosses the site will be improved and hides built along the footpath at key vantage points. Birds identified at the site include: buzzard, sparrowhawk, kestrel, hobby, red kite, barn owl, lapwing, pheasant, cuckoo, woodpecker and skylark.\n\nThe Anglican parish Church of St Mary, which was consecrated in 1331, is an anachronism. Parts of the current building including the piscina and font were moved from an earlier church in fields outside the village. Its central tower is a style that was at least a century out of date. It underwent some alteration in the 15th century, particularly to tower and West end, with further restoration in 1861 by George Gilbert Scott. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.\n\nShapwick is home to Shapwick School which was founded in 1974 in Glastonbury, but moved into the village in 1984.\nIt is a special school for children aged 8 to 18 with dyslexia. Pupils aged 13 to 18 are based at Shapwick Senior School in the village, while those aged 8 to 12 are based at Shapwick Prep in nearby Burtle. In November 2010, the school was featured in November a BBC Three documentary \"Kara Tointon: Don't call me stupid\" about actress Kara Tointon who suffers from dyslexia.\n\nShapwick railway station was a station on the Highbridge branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It opened in 1854 and closed in 1966.\n\nIt was the birthplace of Australian politician Henry Strangways in 1832 and Girl Guide leader Joan Marsham in 1888.\n\nChurchill Julius, later the first Archbishop of New Zealand, was briefly Vicar of Shapwick in the 1870s.\n\nIn 2012, the musician Jon Brookes (aka 'The Advisory Circle' of the Ghost Box record label) released an electronica album entitled 'Shapwick' (on the Clay Pipe record label) based on \"an imaginary impression of\" the village and its surrounding countryside, following an unplanned car journey through the area one autumn evening: \"I felt a certain energy around the place. The images created by the trees in the dark conjured inspiration and it struck me that an album could be based on an imaginary impression of this area. I had already recorded some pieces that were in search of a home and the idea formed within seconds.\"\n\nShapwick also featured in songwriter Daren Hayman's Thankful Villages project in 2017. Hayman visited each of the 54 villages and recorded songs and interviews with local residents and a short film. The film for Shapwick features Darren performing his song based on the folk tale The Mistletoe Bride in locations around the village. \n\n"}

The beach is very clean and is also known for regular sightings of dolphins.\n\nThe nearest settlements are the villages of Dyffryn Ardudwy and Llanbedr where several camp and caravan sites and guest-houses are available.\n\nNaturism has been practised at Morfa Dyffryn since the late 1930s. The beach can attract several hundred naturists in summer during fine weather - despite which, it is rarely crowded. Most visitors come from North Wales and North West England, although visitors from mainland Europe are not unknown.\n\nIn 2000, after complaints from local residents of indecent exposure on other parts of beach and the access footpaths, steps were taken to designate a clearly marked 1 kilometre length of the beach as officially naturist. Although the official designation was resisted by some local residents, complaints of indecent exposure and related behaviour have markedly decreased since 2000. The naturist section of the beach is now clearly marked by signs at both ends. Some naturists complain that the official section is too small - the traditional naturist area was in length.\n\nAnother complaint by naturists relates to the ban on naturist sunbathing in the sand dunes. Traditionally, most families and heterosexual couples have sunbathed on the beach while most gay men and many single heterosexual men have sunbathed on the dunes. Patrols by the police or beach patrol take place, and usually result in sunbathers being instructed to move down from the dunes onto the beach.\n\nThe naturist section of the beach is up to 30 minutes' walk from the nearest car parks.\n\n"}

Most simplistically, a mental state is a mental condition. It is a relation that connects the agent with a proposition. Several of these states are a combination of mental representations and propositional attitudes. There are several paradigmatic states of mind that an agent has: love, hate, pleasure and pain, and attitudes toward propositions such as: believing that, conceiving that, hoping and fearing that, etc.\n\nDiscussions about mental states can be found in many areas of study.\n\nIn cognitive psychology and the philosophy of mind, a mental state is a kind of hypothetical state that corresponds to thinking and feeling, and consists of a conglomeration of mental representations and propositional attitudes. Several theories in philosophy and psychology try to determine the relationship between the agent's mental state and a proposition.\n\nInstead of looking into what a mental state is, in itself, clinical psychology and psychiatry determine a person's mental health through a mental status examination.\n\nMental states also include attitudes towards propositions, of which there are at least two—factive, non-factive, both of which entail the mental state of acquaintance. To be acquainted with a proposition is to understand its meaning and be able to entertain it. The proposition can be true or false, and acquaintance requires no specific attitude towards that truth or falsity. Factive attitudes include those mental states that are attached to the truth of the proposition—i.e. the proposition entails truth. Some factive mental states include \"perceiving that\", \"remembering that\", \"regretting that\", and (more controversially) \"knowing that\". Non-factive attitudes do not entail the truth of the propositions to which they are attached. That is, one can be in one of these mental states and the proposition can be false. An example of a non-factive attitude is believing—you can believe a false proposition and you can believe a true proposition.

The title means \"Malagasy Adventure\" in English.\n\nThere are conflicting reports as to the true inspiration for the film, lawyer Jules François Clermont or actor Claude Dauphin. Some sources claim the film is based on the real-life activities of Jules François Clermont, who wrote and starred in the film under the name \"Paul Clarus\". In September 2011, \"The Daily Telegraph\" published an article noting that writer and actor Claude Dauphin had collaborated with Hitchcock to recount his own experiences of operating an underground radio station in Nazi occupied France.\n\nPaul Clarus, a French actor (played by \"Paul Clarus\") is chatting with his fellow actors (the \"Molière Players\") as they put on their makeup before a performance. He reminisces about a very unpleasant Vichy official, the Chef de la Sûreté, (Paul Bonifas) that he knew when he was part of the Resistance on the island of Madagascar during the Second World War. The events on Madagascar are shown in flashback.\n\nPaul Clarus pretended to be loyal to the Vichy official, while he simultaneously worked as the head of the Resistance movement. He ran an illegal pro-Resistance radio station \"Madagascar Libre\", and helped arrange numerous boats to take loyal Frenchmen out of the island to safety. Finally when the Vichy government falls, we see that the Vichy official is nothing but a turncoat; in his office he rapidly replaces a portrait of Marshal Philippe Pétain with a portrait of Queen Victoria, and he changes his bottle of Vichy water for bottles of Scotch and soda water.\n\n\nMilestone Films has released \"Aventure Malgache\", paired with other 1944 French language Hitchcock short film \"Bon Voyage\", on DVD and VHS.\n\n"}

He was the eldest son of Sancho II of Pamplona and Urraca Fernández and the second Pamplonese monarch to also hold the title of count of Aragon. Modern historians refer to him as \"the Tremulous\", though this appellation likely originally applied to his grandfather, García Sánchez I of Pamplona.\n\nThroughout his reign, his foreign policy seems to have been closely linked to that of Castile. His mother was an aunt of count Sancho García of Castile, and also of the powerful count of Saldaña, García Gómez of Carrión, and she appears to have played a role in forming a bridge between the kingdom and county.\n\nHe joined his cousin Sancho in attempting to break from the submission his father had offered to Córdoba, as a result of which he had to face Almanzor. In 996 he was forced to seek peace in Córdoba. In 997 during an expedition into the land of Calatayud, García killed the governor's brother. Almanzor took revenge by beheading 50 Christians. At the Battle of Cervera in July 1000, he joined, along with count García Gómez of Saldaña, in a coalition headed by count Sancho García of Castile that was defeated by Almanzor (that count Sancho led the group is thought to reflect García's decline). Tradition names him one of the Christian leaders at the 1002 Battle of Calatañazor, which resulted in the death of Almanzor and the consequent crisis in the Caliphate of Córdoba, but there is no contemporary record of him after 1000, while his cousin Sancho Ramírez of Viguera may have been ruling in Pamplona in 1002. García was certainly dead by 1004, when his son Sancho Garcés III first appears as king.\n\nDomestically, he granted the rule in Aragon to his brother Gonzalo, under the tutelage of his mother Urraca. A tradition reports that he freed all of the Muslim captives being held in the kingdom. \n\nGarcía Sánchez II was married to Jimena Fernández, daughter of Fernando Bermúdez, Count of Cea and a distinguished member of the highest ranks of the nobility of the Kingdom of León.

The species primarily feeds on plant material and typically nests in large groups on beaches. Due to hunting of adults, collecting of their eggs, pollution, habitat loss, and dams, the Arrau turtle is seriously threatened.\n\nArrau turtles are found in the Amazon, Orinoco and Essequibo basins in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and Guyana. On occasion, typically after floods, individuals turn up in Trinidad. They are found in deep rivers, ponds, freshwater lagoons and flooded forest in white-, black- and clear-water.\n\nArrau turtles can reach up to in weight and the carapace length is up to . Most individuals are considerably smaller with the average adult female having a carapace length of and the average adult male . In addition to an overall smaller size, males can be recognized by their longer tail and straighter carapace than the females. Arrau turtles are brown, gray or olive-green, but the exact color varies depending on the algae growing on the carapace.\n\nAdult Arrau turtles feed almost entirely on plant material such as fruits, seeds, leaves and algae, but may also take freshwater sponges, eggs and carcasses of dead animals. Captives have been recorded feeding on meat. Juveniles feed on fish and plant material. The species is mainly active during the day.\n\nWhen nearing the breeding season, Arrau turtles migrate to certain sites where the eggs are laid. In some locations nesting occurs in large groups on beaches, which reduces the risk posed by predators. Some beaches have as many as 500 nesting females. Mating occurs in the water. During and just before the nesting season the species frequently basks, typically in groups. It is suspected that the additional heat accelerates the ovulation in the females. At other times the species is generally not found on land. When on land, it is usually very shy and retreats to the water at the slightest hint of danger. The female lays an average of 75–123 eggs (average varies depending on region), which are placed during the night in a deep nest that is dug on the beach. The eggs are laid during the low water season and hatch as the water starts to rise. If it rises too fast or too early, the nest is flooded and the young die within the eggs. As long as nests are not dug up by predators, the hatching success rate is usually high, averaging at 83%. The eggs hatch after about 50 days and the sex of the young depends on the nest temperature (females at higher temperatures, males at lower). When hatching, the young are around long and dart directly for the water, but they emerge to the attentions of many predators so that only about five percent ever reach the adult feeding grounds. When hatching, the females emit sounds which attract the young; they stay together for a period in the flooded forests. Vocalizations appear to play an important role in the social life of this turtle and in addition to the \"connect to newly hatched young\" sound, four primary sounds have been documented during the nesting season: one used during migration, one before basking, one when nesting at night and finally one when in the water after nesting.\n\nThey can reach an age of 20 years or more in the wild, and captives have lived for at least 25 years. Based on certain scientific models it has been estimated that the largest individuals perhaps are as old as 80 years.\n\nThe Arrau turtle is widespread and was not considered threatened overall by the IUCN in 1996 (the year of the last full review), but it has declined drastically, and a draft review by the IUCN Species Survival Commission—Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group in 2011 recommended that it should be considered critically endangered. The species is slow to mature; some have suggested that females reach maturity when 4–8 years old and other when about 17 years old. Their social behavior, especially at certain nesting beaches, makes them and their eggs vulnerable to humans. In addition to being used for food, they are sometimes used in traditional medicine. At the main known nesting beaches, it is estimated that the number of nests fell from 34,000 in 1963 to 4,700 in 1981. In the middle Orinoco River alone, it is estimated that as many as 330,000 nested in 1800, but less than half this number nested in 1945 and by the early 2000s (decade) it had fallen to 700–1300. In addition to hunting and collecting of their eggs, threats include pollution, habitat loss, and dams, which can cause flooding of nest sites. Several countries in their range have implemented laws protecting the species, but hunting and egg collection (even if illegal) continues. A number of conservation projects have been initiated. For example, 54 nesting beaches have been protected in Brazil, beaches used by more than 1,000 females are protected in Colombia, and since the mid-1990s many thousand eggs have been collected in Venezuela for safe incubation, the hatchlings \"headstarted\" (getting them through the most dangerous period) and then released. All species in the genus \"Podocnemis\" are listed on CITES Appendix II.\n\nThe slow growth limits its potential for major commercial turtle farming. Nevertheless, about 880,000 turtles of various species were kept at 92 farms (both ones that are commercial and ones with conservation purpose) in 2004 in Brazil alone, and some of these keep Arrau turtles, also in semi-intensive farm systems.\n"}

Isherwood\n\nBenjamin Franklin Isherwood (October 6, 1822 – June 19, 1915) was an engineering officer in the United States Navy during the early days of steam-powered warships. He served as a ship's engineer during the Mexican–American War, and after the war did experimental work with steam propulsion. Rising to the rank of rear admiral, as Engineer-in-Chief of the Navy during the Civil War, he helped to found the Navy's Bureau of Steam Engineering.\n\nIsherwood was born in New York City. He worked for the Utica and Schenectady Railroad and trained under William C. Young, one of the most prominent engineers of that period. Isherwood then worked on the Croton Aqueduct, followed by an engineering job on the Erie Canal. Designing and constructing lighthouses for the Treasury Department was Isherwood's last employment before joining the Navy.\n\nAt the age of 22, Isherwood was appointed first assistant engineer in the Navy May 23, 1844, serving aboard from 1846 to 1847. During the Mexican–American War, he served on the , and later was senior engineer of the .\n\nWhen the Mexican–American War ended, Isherwood was assigned to the Washington Navy Yard, where he assisted Charles Stuart in designing engines and experiments with steam as a source of power for propelling ships. Throughout the 1850s, Isherwood compiled operational and performance data from steam engines in American and foreign commercial vessels and warships. He used these empirical data to analyze the efficiency of engine types then in use.\n\nIn the twelve years between the Mexican–American War and the Civil War, Isherwood published 55 technical and scientific articles on steam engineering and vessel propulsion in the prestigious \"Journal of the Franklin Institute\". In 1859 the engineer published the results of his own original thermodynamic experiments in the two-volume \"Engineering Precedents for Steam Machinery\". Isherwood was the nation's most prolific antebellum technical writer.\n\nIsherwood went to sea during the period between the wars, serving as Chief Engineer of the steam frigate on a cruise of more than three years on the Asiatic Station. During this cruise he was stricken with dysentery, prompting his return to the United States.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, Isherwood was appointed Engineer-in-Chief of the Navy, and so important were his services considered that the Bureau of Steam Engineering was created under his direction.\n\nWhen the Civil War began, the Navy had 28 steam vessels, and during the war, the number grew to 600. Isherwood conducted the design and construction of the machinery necessary to accomplish this. He designed ships that were fast enough to pursue the blockade runners.\n\nIn 1863 and 1865, Isherwood published the first and second volumes of \"Experimental Researches in Steam Engineering\", which were translated into six languages and became a standard engineering text upon which future steam experimentation was based.\n\nImmediately upon the conclusion of the war, Isherwood was principally involved with organizing a new scientific curriculum for steam engineering at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. By 1874, naval engineers refined this curriculum to the point that it served as the model for mechanical engineering education at most American universities.\n\nIn 1869 Isherwood ran afoul of former shipmate Admiral David Dixon Porter. During the war years Isherwood led a campaign to increase the rank and influence of engineering officers in the navy. Porter opposed this change in the service's class structure. After the presidential inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant, Isherwood's longtime patron, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, could no longer protect him. Admiral Porter banished Isherwood to the Mare Island Navy Yard in San Francisco.\n\nDespite his diminished stature, Isherwood continued to produce technical innovations. In 1870 and 1871, Isherwood conducted experiments that resulted in a propeller that was used by the Navy for the next 27 years.\n\nHe was a pioneer in the production of fast cruisers, producing this class against strong opposition. Following a tour of European dockyards, he became president of the Experimental Board under the Bureau of Steam Engineering until his retirement on October 6, 1884.\n\nIsherwood died in New York City at the age of 92.\n\nThe Navy has recognized Isherwood's contributions in various ways. \"Isherwood Hall\", built in 1905 on the campus of the United States Naval Academy, was the home of the Department of Marine Engineering. It was razed in 1982 to make space for the Academy's new \"Alumni Hall\". Isherwood's name lives on as the new hall's \"Isherwood Entrance\".\n\nThe Rear Admiral Benjamin F. Isherwood Award is awarded by the Navy to recognize \"innovation and expertise in the effective assessment, development, execution, or deployment of technological solutions for operational Fleet needs.\"\n\nThree U.S. Navy ships – two destroyers named and the never-finished fleet replenishment oiler – have been named for him.\n\nIn a 1941 article in the United States Naval Institute's \"Proceedings\", George W. Dyson stated that Isherwood might possibly be the greatest engineer the United States Navy had developed.\n\nThe revolutionary engineering program initiated by Isherwood at the U.S. Naval Academy became the template for professional American mechanical engineering education. That basic curriculum designed at Annapolis in the late 1860s and early 1870s still serves as the core of university mechanical engineering pedagogy.\n\n\n\n"}

After being requisitioned for troop transport service by the United States Army for World War II and continued service post war the ship was sold in 1949 and became the \"Arosa Star\". After further sales and change in the cruise ship regulations the ship was again sold and grounded as \"La Jenelle\" on the California coast in 1970.\n\n\"Borinquen\", designed by Theodore E. Ferris, was laid down at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts 20 January 1930, launched 24 September 1930 and completed in 1931 with delivery 20 February 1931. The ship's name comes from the Taino language name, \"Borikén\", for the island of Puerto Rico. \"Borinquen\" was delivered to the Atlantic, Gulf & West Indies Steamship Lines (AGWI) for operation by AGWI's subsidiary, New York & Porto Rico Line. \"Borinquen\" was similar in characteristics and design to the line's earlier ship, SS \"Coamo\" (1925) with the Lloyd's Register, 1930–31 showing the ship as ordered for the New York & Porto Rico Steamship Company with an original date of 1930, both stricken, with a new date 1931 and \"Coamo S.S. Corp\" with New York & Porto Rico Steamship Company as manager.\n\nThe ship was propelled by single, impulse-reaction type, reduction geared turbines furnished with steam by oil fired tube boilers for about 6,500 horsepower.\n\nThe ship arrived in New York 22 February 1931 and began her working career with a maiden voyage from New York to San Juan, Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic which would become her regular scheduled route.\n\nDuring World War II she was requisitioned from Agwilines, Inc. by the War Shipping Administration on 31 December 1941 with Agwilines as the operator. On 6 May 1944 \"Borinquen\" was transferred to direct War Department operation by the Transportation Corps under bareboat charter as the USAT \"Borinquen\" until returned to Agwilines 14 June 1946. She had a capacity for 1,289 troops and 404 medical patients. USAT \"Borinquen\" was one of the Army transports at Normandy.\n\nBeginning on 15 January 1942 the ship's operations centered on the North Atlantic with overseas ports in Iceland and Scotland until 10 May when she departed Scotland for Freetown and began a period of operation involving African ports. In June she began a voyage from Cape Town to Aden and Suez before returning to West African operations. After a return to New York on 10 August she began operations beginning in November from Belfast and Liverpool involving North Africa and Britain with Oran, Casablanca and Algiers as usual ports before making port in Palermo, Sicily on 31 July 1943. After a return to New York on 22 August 1943 operations were between ports in the United States and Britain until on 5 June she departed Swansea with the destination being listed as Port en Bessin, France that was the arrival off Normandy invasion beaches on 7 June 1944. She made one more trip to Belfast returning to Grandcamp, France 9 July before beginning a shuttle service largely between Belfast and Liverpool until a return to New York 25 October 1944. After departure from New York 3 January 1945 she again began a routine shuttle between Southampton and Le Havre until a run to Marseille in August and a return to New York on 31 August 1945.\n\nOn 25 April 1949, she was sold to the Bull Steamship Company and renamed the Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 1954 she was purchased by the Arosa Line (\"Compañía Internacional Transportadora\" – owned by Nicolo Rizzi, a Swiss-Italian financier) and operated as the extensively rebuilt Arosa Star until 1958. As the \"Arosa Star\" she was the third largest ship of the Arosa Line, a Swiss cruise line, operating in the mid-1950s. The 2 larger ships in the fleet were the flagship \"Arosa Sky\", and the older \"Arosa Sun\" – originally the French-built liner . Then came the \"Arosa Star\", with \"Arosa Kulm\" bringing up the rear. The \"Arosa Star\" was a ship which traveled several different routes, with many crew on board. At one time Kurt Ebberg was master, Alex Von Blessingh was first officer, Ernest Kuehne was chief engineer, Karl Nahrath was chief purser, and Hasso Wolf was the doctor of the ship.\n\nDuring at least part of this period, she transported immigrants from northern Europe to Canada and the United States, with regular ports of call at Halifax, Quebec City, Montreal and New York City. With the advent of affordable air travel, the market for hauling immigrants quickly disappeared and the Arosa Line went bankrupt.\n\nIn the years 1959–69, she was operated for Eastern Steamship Lines as the Bahama Star, sailing primarily between Florida and the Bahamas. During this period, the \"Bahama Star\" managed to rescue 489 people from the burning SS \"Yarmouth Castle\", another cruise ship; 90 people perished in the blaze. In an ironic twist of fate, this accident led to changes to the maritime regulations pertaining to such ships at the Geneva Convention of 1964, outlawing the operation of passenger vessels with wooden super-structures. The cost of complying with the new regulations proved too expensive, so the ship was sold to the Western Steamship Company.\n\nShe was renamed again, this time to La Jenelle. The new owners brought her to Port Hueneme, California, where they intended to sell her. Some say that plans were underway to make her a floating restaurant/casino. Others claim she was to be sold to an Indonesian shipping firm, but neither plan materialized. By 1970, she was anchored outside the harbor to avoid expensive docking fees while efforts were made to find a buyer. On April 13, her luck ran out. That particular day was blustery, with a northwest gale ripping the tops off the waves. Seas broke everywhere, and nearly everyone was in port. \"La Jenelle\"s starboard anchor – the only one out – began to drag. There were only two crewmen aboard, and they were unable to stop her drift. Only 23 minutes later, she struck the sandy beach west of the Port Hueneme breakwater, her stern just missing the rocks. \"La Jenelle\" began to list as she took on water. The crew stayed aboard, attempting to pump her dry so she could be righted, but the seas were pouring in from many smashed portholes and windows making their efforts fruitless. A helicopter arrived to rescue them as the ship settled further into the sand.\n\nThe \"La Jenelle\" proved to be quite an attraction. Crowds flocked to Silver Strand Beach to see the stranded behemoth. Surfers paddled out to the stricken ship to wander among passageways canted at impossible angles, reminiscent of the film, Poseidon Adventure. Salvers picked over her bones, tearing away loose brass hardware and anything else of value. Her plates began to buckle under the incessant pounding of the surf as one compartment after another was destroyed. A fire, perhaps started by vandals, gutted her interior. La Jenelle became a real hazard in time, for it was impossible to keep people off her. Eventually a souvenir hunter fell from the wreck and was drowned. By then, the owners had faded from the scene during the litigation that follows such an incident. A United States Navy team cut the top off the ship and brought in rocks to fill in the carcass. \"La Jenelle\" was transformed into a new arm for the Port of Hueneme breakwater.\n\n\n\n"}

The Gallery's first public exhibition opened in 1874. Admission is free to the general exhibition space, which displays Australian art (from settlement to contemporary), European and Asian art. A dedicated Asian Gallery was opened in 2003.\n\nOn 24 April 1871, a public meeting was convened in Sydney to establish an Academy of Art 'for the purpose of promoting the fine arts through lectures, art classes and regular exhibitions.' From 1872 until 1879 the Academy's main activity was the organisation of annual art exhibitions. The first exhibition of colonial art, under the auspices of the Academy, was held at the Chamber of Commerce, Sydney Exchange in 1874. In 1875 \"Apsley Falls\" by Conrad Martens, commissioned by the trustees and purchased for £50 out of the first government grant of £500, became the first work on paper by an Australian artist to be acquired by the Gallery.\n\nThe Gallery's collection was first housed at Clark's Assembly Hall in Elizabeth Street where it was open to the public on Friday and Saturday afternoons. The collection was relocated in 1879 to a wooden annexe to the Garden Palace built for the Sydney International Exhibition in the Domain and was officially opened as \"The Art Gallery of New South Wales\". In 1882, the first Director, Eliezer Montefiore and his fellow trustees opened the art gallery on Sunday afternoons from 2 pm to 5 pm. Montefiore believed:\nThe destruction of the Garden Palace by fire in 1882 placed pressure on the government to provide a permanent home for the national collection. In 1883 private architect John Horbury Hunt was engaged by the trustees to submit designs. The same year there was a change of name to \"The National Art Gallery of New South Wales\". The Gallery was incorporated by \"The Library and Art Gallery Act\" 1899.\n\nIn 1895, the new Colonial Architect, Walter Liberty Vernon (1846–1914), was given the assignment to design the new permanent gallery and two picture galleries were opened in 1897 and a further two in 1899. A watercolour gallery was added in 1901 and in 1902 the Grand Oval Lobby was completed.\n\nOver 300,000 people came to the Gallery during March and April 1906 to see Holman Hunt's painting \"The Light of the World\". In 1921, the inaugural Archibald Prize was awarded to W.B. McInnes for his portrait of architect \"Desbrowe Annear\". The equestrian statues \"The offerings of peace\" and \"The offerings of war\" by Gilbert Bayes were installed in front of the main facade in 1926. James Stuart MacDonald was appointed director and secretary in 1929. In 1936 the inaugural Sulman Prize was awarded to Henry Hanke for \"La Gitana\". John William Ashton was appointed director and secretary in 1937.\nThe first woman to win the Archibald Prize was Nora Heysen in 1938 with her portrait \"Mme Elink Schuurman\", the wife of the Consul General for the Netherlands. The same year electric light was temporarily installed at the Gallery to remain open at night for the first time. In 1943 William Dobell won the Archibald Prize for \"Joshua Smith\", causing considerable controversy. Hal Missingham was appointed director and secretary in 1945.\n\nIn 1958 the \"Art Gallery of New South Wales Act\" was amended and the Gallery’s name reverted to \"The Art Gallery of New South Wales\".\n\nIn 1969 construction began on the Captain Cook wing to celebrate the bicentenary of Cook's landing in Botany Bay. The new wing opened in May 1972, following the retirement of Missingham and the appointment of Peter Phillip Laverty as director in 1971.\n\nThe first of the modern blockbusters to be held at the Gallery was \"Modern masters: Monet to Matisse\" in 1975. It attracted 180,000 people over 29 days. The 1976 the Biennale of Sydney was held at the Gallery for the first time. The Sydney Opera House had been the location for the inaugural Biennale in 1973. 1977 saw an exhibition \"A selection of recent archaeological finds of the People's Republic of China.\" Edmund Capon was appointed director in 1978 and in 1980 \"The Art Gallery of New South Wales Act\" (1980) established the \"Art Gallery of New South Wales Trust\". It reduced the number of trustees to nine and stipulated that \"at least two\" members \"shall be knowledgeable and experienced in the visual arts\".\n\nWith the support of then Premier Neville Wran a major extension of the Gallery became a Bicennential project. Opened just in time in December 1988, the extensions doubled the floor space of the Gallery. In 1993 Kevin Connor won the inaugural Dobell Prize for Drawing for \"Pyrmont and city\". In 1994, the Yiribana Gallery, dedicated to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art, was opened.\n\nIn 2003 an \"Art After Hours\" program was initiated with the Gallery opening hours extended every Wednesday. The inaugural Australian Photographic Portrait Prize was won by Greg Weight. The Art Gallery Society of New South Wales celebrated its 50th anniversary in the same year and the Rudy Komon Gallery exhibition space was opened, followed by the new Asian gallery.\n\nA 2004 exhibition of Man Ray's work set an attendance record for photography exhibitions, with over 52,000 visitors. The same year a legal challenge was mounted against the award of the Archibald Prize to Craig Ruddy for his David Gulpilil, two worlds; and the Anne Landa Award was established, Australia's first award for moving image and new media. The Nelson Meers Foundation Nolan Room was opened, also in 2004, with a display of five major Sidney Nolan paintings gifted to the Gallery by the Foundation over the past five years.\n\nmyVirtualGallery was launched on the Gallery's website in 2005 and the former boardroom was reopened for display of paintings, sculptures and works on paper by Australian artists.\n\nIn 2005 Justice Hamilton ruled in favour of the Gallery over the disputed 2004 award of the Archibald Prize to Craig Ruddy. The same year, James Gleeson and his partner Frank O’Keefe pledged A$16 million through the Gleeson O’Keefe Foundation to acquire works for the Gallery's collection.\n\nOn 10 June 2007, a 17th-century work by Frans van Mieris, entitled \"A Cavalier (Self-Portrait)\", was stolen from the gallery. The painting had been donated by John Fairfax and was valued at over A$1 million. The theft raised questions about need for increased security at the gallery. In the same year the Belgiorno-Nettis family donated A$4 million over four years to the Gallery to support contemporary art.\n\nIn 2008 the Gallery purchased Paul Cézanne's painting \"Bords de la Marne\" \"ca.\" 1888 for A$16.2 million – the highest amount paid by the Gallery for a work of art. In the same year the NSW Government announced a grant of A$25.7 million to construct an offsite storage facility and a gift from the John Kaldor Family Collection to the Gallery was announced. Valued at over A$35 million, it comprised some 260 works representing the history of international contemporary art. The refurbishment of the 19th-century Grand Courts was celebrated in the Gallery’s inaugural 'Open Weekend' in 2009.\nA new contemporary gallery was created in 2010 by removing storage racks from the lowest level of the Captain Cook wing, and artworks were relocated to an off site storage. The new purpose-built off-site collection storage facility began operations. The same year, the award of the Wynne Prize to Sam Leach for \"Proposal for landscaped cosmos\" caused controversy due to the painting's resemblance to a 17th-century Dutch landscape; and the Gallery announced Mollie Gowing's bequest of 142 artworks plus A$5 million to establish two endowment funds for acquisitions: one for Indigenous art and a larger one for general acquisitions.\n\nThe 2011 exhibition \"The First Emperor: China’s entombed warriors\" attracted more than 305,000 people and in the same year new contemporary galleries were opened, including the John Kaldor Family Gallery, plus a dedicated photography gallery and a refurbished works-on-paper study room. In August 2011 Edmund Capon announced his retirement after 33 years as director.\n\nDr Michael Brand assumed the role of director in mid 2012. \"Picasso: masterpieces from the Musée National Picasso, Paris\" attracted almost 365,000 visitors – the largest number ever to an exhibition at the Gallery, also in 2012 and Michael Zavros won the inaugural Bulgari Art Award with \"The new Round Room\". In the same year Kenneth Reed announced his intention to bequeath his entire private collection of 200 pieces of rare and valuable 18th-century European porcelain valued at A$5.4 million.\n\nIn 2013 the Gallery unveiled a strategic vision and masterplan, under the working title \"Sydney Modern\": a proposal for major expansion and renewed focus on serving a global audience. The stated aim was to complete the project by 2021, the 150th anniversary of the Gallery's founding in 1871. In the same year, the Gallery received A$10.8 million from the NSW Government to finance the planning stages of \"Sydney Modern\", which would see the construction of a new building and double the size of the institution. The money was used over the next two years for feasibility and engineering studies related to the use of land next to the gallery's existing 19th-century home, and to launch an international architectural competition.\n\nThe International design competition for the Sydney Modern Project resulted in five architectural firms being invited from an original list of twelve to submit their final concept designs in April 2015. A mix of private and NSW Government funds will pay for the A$450 million project, The firm of McGregor Coxall was chosen to redesign the gardens. The project has attracted controversy for its expense and encroachment into the public land of The Domain and the Royal Botanic Gardens and its dependence on \"much greater commercialisation\".\n\nIn 1883 John Horbury Hunt, an architect in private practice, was engaged by the Gallery's Trustees to design a permanent gallery. Though Hunt submitted four detailed designs in various styles between 1884 and 1895, his work came to nothing apart from a temporary building in The Domain. With raw brick walls and a saw-tooth roof, it was denounced in the press as the \"Art Barn\".\n\nNewly appointed Government Architect, Walter Liberty Vernon, secured the prestigious commission over John Horbury Hunt in 1895. Vernon believed that the Gothic style admitted greater individuality and richness 'not obtainable in the colder and unbending lines of Pagan Classic.' The Trustees were not convinced and demanded a classical temple to art, not unlike William Henry Playfair's Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, opened in 1859.\n\nVernon's building, housing eight daylight lit courts, was built in four stages. The first stage was commenced in 1896 and opened in May 1897. By 1901 the entire southern half of the building was finished. A newspaper article at the time noted:\n\nVernon proposed that his oval lobby lead into an equally imposing Central Court. His plans were not accepted. Until 1969 his lobby led, by a short descent from the entrance level, to the three 'temporary' northern galleries designed by Hunt.\n\nIn 1909 the front of the Gallery was finished and after this date nothing more was built of Vernon's designs. In the 1930s plans were suggested for the completion of this part of the Gallery but the Great Depression and other financial constraints lead to their abandonment.\n\nIn 1968 the New South Wales Government decided the completion of the Gallery would be a major part of the Captain Cook Bicentenary celebrations. This extension, which was opened to the public in November 1972, and the 1988 Bicentennial extensions, were both entrusted to the New South Wales Government Architect, with Andrew Andersons the project architect.\n\nThe architecture of the Captain Cook wing did not attempt to clone the classical style of Vernon's design. Andersons' design philosophy was akin to that espoused by Robert Venturi in his book \"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture\", as Andersons explains: \n\nIn the Captain Cook wing Andersons divided new from old with a wide strip of skylights in the main entry court. While in the old courts there was parquetry flooring, travertine flooring was employed in the new galleries for both permanent and temporary exhibitions. The modern need for flexibility in display layout was answered by the use of track lighting and precast ceiling panels designed to support a system of demountable walls. While the new galleries were painted off white, senior curator, Daniel Thomas, advocated a rich Victorian colour scheme to display the Gallery's 19th-century paintings in Vernon's grand courts.\n\nSixteen years later the 1988 Bicentennial extension was built on The Domain parkland sloping steeply to the east. Within the constraints of two large Moreton Bay fig trees, and with a substantial part of the accommodation below ground level, the extension doubled the size of the Gallery. Space for permanent collections and temporary exhibitions was expanded, a new Asian gallery, the Domain Theatre, a café overlooking Woolloomooloo Bay, and a rooftop sculpture garden were added. Escalators connected four exhibition levels with the entry/orientation space. Four contemporary art 'rooms' were top lit by pyramid skylights.\n\nA new space for Asian art was built to add to the existing Asian art gallery immediately below. Backlit translucent external cladding glows at night and has been dubbed the \"light box\". This addition was coupled with other alterations: a new temporary exhibition space on the top level, new conservation studios, an outward expansion of the café overlooking Woolloomooloo Bay, a new restaurant with dedicated function area, a theatrette and relocation of the gallery shop. The project was designed was by Sydney architect Richard Johnson and was opened on 25 October 2003. The space involves art from all corners of Asia, including Buddhist and Hindu arts, Indian sculptures, Southern Asian textiles, Chinese ceramics and paintings, Japanese works and more.\nThe aesthetics of the extension were described as \"cantilevered on top of the original Asian galleries, the pavilion glows softly like a paper lantern when lit at night\" and as \"a floating white glass and steel cube pivoted with modern stainless steel lotus flowers\". The extension added to the New South Wales Art Gallery, with the new space to house temporary and permanent exhibitions. In 2004 Johnson Pilton Walker won two awards for their involvement in the creation of the Asian Galleries extension, including the RAIA National Commendation, Sir Zelman Cowan Award for Public Buildings; and the RAIA NSW Chapter, Architecture Award for Public and Commercial Buildings. Over A$16 million was granted from the NSW Government for this major building project – inclusive also of the Rudy Komon Gallery, new conservation studios, café, restaurant and function area, and a refurbishment of the administration area. Upon completion the extension was featured in the September–October 2003 edition of \"Architecture Bulletin\" and described the new wing as\n\nPlans to extend the gallery under the name the \"Sydney Modern Project\" resulted from a competition won in 2015 by Tokyo architects Kazuyo Sejima + Ryue Nishizawa of SANAA. The chosen design, which proposes a massive extension to the north, have been criticised on architectural as well as public interest grounds. Former architect Andersons described it as intrusive, \"colliding\" with Vernon's sandstone façade and relegating his portico to a ceremonial entrance. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating criticised proposals to significantly develop the outdoor spaces near the gallery for use as private venues as more about money than art. The Foundation and Friends of the neighbouring Royal Botanic Garden, objected to the loss of green space and parkland in the Domain associated with the project, requested a review and negotiated with the Gallery about site lines, transport, logistics and alignment of building structures.\n\nIn 1871 the collection started with the acquisition by The Art Society of some large works from Europe such as Ford Madox Brown's \"Chaucer at the Court of Edward III\". Later they bought work from Australian artists such as Streeton's 1891 \"Fire's On\", Roberts' 1894 \"The Golden Fleece\" and McCubbin's 1896 \"On the Wallaby Track.\"\n\nIn 2014 the collection is categorised into:\n\nThe collection represents Indigenous artists from communities across Australia. The earliest work in the collection, by Tommy McRae, dates from the late 19th century. Included in the collection are desert paintings created by small family groups living on remote Western Desert outstations, bark paintings of the saltwater people of coastal communities and the new media expressions of 'blak city culture' by contemporary artists.\n\nThe first works to enter the collection in 1879 were a large group of ceramics and bronzes – a gift from the Government of Japan following the Sydney International Exhibition that year. The Asian collections after grown from that beginning to be wide-ranging, embracing the countries and cultures of South, Southeast and East Asia.\n\nThe collection dates from the early 1800s. 19th-century Australian artists represented include: John Glover, Arthur Streeton, Eugene von Guerard, John Russell, Tom Roberts, David Davies, Charles Conder, William Piguenit, E. Phillips Fox (including \"Nasturtiums\"), Frederick McCubbin, Sydney Long and George W. Lambert.\n\n20th-century Australian artists represented include: Arthur Boyd, Rupert Bunny, Grace Cossington Smith, H. H. Calvert, William Dobell, Russell Drysdale, James Gleeson, Sidney Nolan, John Olsen, Margaret Preston, Hugh Ramsay, Lloyd Rees, Imants Tillers, J. W. Tristram, Roland Wakelin, Brett Whiteley, Fred Williams and Blamire Young.\n\nForty four works held at the gallery were included in the 1973 edition of \"100 Masterpieces of Australian Painting\".\n\nSelected works\nThe contemporary collection is international, encompassing Asian and Western as well as Australian art in all media. With the gift of the John Kaldor Family Collection, the Gallery now holds arguably Australia's most comprehensive representation of contemporary art from the 1960s to the present day. Internationally, the focus is on the influence of conceptual art, nouveau realisme, minimalism and arte povera. The Australian contemporary art collection focuses on abstract painting, expressionism, screen culture and pop art.\n\nThe collection of art from the Pacific region began in 1962 at the instigation of our then deputy director, Tony Tuckson. Between 1968 and 1977, the Gallery acquired over 500 works from the Moriarty Collection, one of the largest and most important private collections of New Guinea Highlands art in the world.\n\nThe photography collection has major holdings of a wide variety of artists including Tracey Moffatt, Bill Henson, Fiona Hall, Micky Allan, Mark Johnson, Max Pam and Lewis Morley. As well as contemporary photography, Australian pictorialism, modernism and postwar photo documentary is represented by The Sydney Camera Circle, Max Dupain and David Moore. The evolution of 19th-century Australian photography is represented with emphasis on the work of Charles Bayliss and Kerry & Co. International photographs include English pictorialism and the European avant garde (Bauhaus, constructivism and surrealism). Photo-documentary in 20th-century America is reflected through the work of Lewis Hine and Dorothea Lange among others. Contemporary Asian practices are represented by artists such as Yasumasa Morimura and Miwa Yanagi. Styles range from the formal aesthetics of early photography to the informal snapshots of Weegee to the high fashion of Helmut Newton and Bettina Rheims.\n\nThe gallery has an extensive collection of British Victorian art, including major works by Lord Frederic Leighton and Sir Edward John Poynter. It has smaller holdings of European art of the 15th to 18th centuries, including works by Peter Paul Rubens, Canaletto, Bronzino, Domenico Beccafumi, Giovanni Battista Moroni and Niccolò dell'Abbate. These works hang in the Grand Courts along with 19th-century works by Eugène Delacroix, John Constable, Ford Madox Brown, Vincent van Gogh, Auguste Rodin, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Camille Pissarro.\n\nBritish art of the 20th century occupies a significant place in the collection together with major European figures such as Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Alberto Giacometti and Giorgio Morandi.\n\nSelected works\nAround 40 temporary exhibitions are held each year; some with an entry charge. In addition to one off exhibitions, the gallery hosts the long running Archibald Prize, the most prominent Australian art prize, along with the Sulman, Wynne and the Dobell art prizes, among others. the Gallery also exhibits ARTEXPRESS, a yearly showcase of Higher School Certificate Visual Arts Examination artworks from across New South Wales.\n\nThe Brett Whiteley Studio at 2 Raper Street, Surry Hills was the workplace and home of Australian artist Brett Whiteley (1939–92). Since 1995 it has been managed as a museum by the Art Gallery of NSW.\n\nGallery educators produce a diverse range of resources for the primary, secondary and tertiary education audiences linked to the collection and major exhibitions.\n\nGallery guides provide tours of the collection and exhibitions to visitors, including school groups, Gallery members, corporate clients and VIPs.\n\nGallery conservators undertake projects to safeguard artworks by preventing, slowing down, remedying or reversing decay and damage while ensuring artworks are safely displayed, stored or transported.\n\nThe Gallery has a program of talks, films, performances, courses and workshops as well as programs designed to increase access for people with special needs.\n\n\nThe Art Gallery of NSW is a statutory body established under the \"Art Gallery of New South Wales Act\" (1980) and is a body aligned with NSW Trade & Investment. Led by a Board of Trustees, the Gallery also provides administrative support for several other entities, each with its own legal structure: the Art Gallery of NSW Foundation, VisAsia, Brett Whiteley Foundation and Art Gallery Society of NSW.\n\nThe Board of Trustees has nine members plus a President and Vice President. An Executive is composed of the Gallery Director, Deputy Directory, and three senior staff members. The Art Gallery of NSW Foundation is the Gallery's major acquisition fund and the umbrella organisation for all the Gallery benefactor groups and funds. It raises money from donations and bequests, invests this capital and then uses the income to purchase works of art for the collection. The Art Gallery of New South Wales has also developed a sound foundation of corporate support. It presenting partners and sponsors include Aqualand Projects Pty Ltd, EY, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, J.P.Morgan, Macquarie Group Limited and UBS.\n\nVisAsia, the Australian Institute of Asian Culture and Visual Arts, was established to promote Asian arts and culture. It includes both the VisAsia Council and individual membership. The Brett Whiteley Foundation, promotes and encourages knowledge and appreciation of the work of the late Brett Whiteley. The Art Gallery Society of NSW is the Gallery's membership organisation. Its objectives are to enhance members' enjoyment of art, and to raise funds for the Gallery's collection. The Society is a separate legal entity, controlled and operated by the Society Council and members.\n\nAt the start of the film \"Sirens\", Hugh Grant walks past paintings in the Art Gallery of NSW, including \"Spring Frost\" by Elioth Gruner, \"The Golden Fleece\" (1894) by Tom Roberts, \"Still Glides the Stream and Shall Forever Glide\" (1890) by Arthur Streeton, \"Bailed Up\" (1895) by Tom Roberts, and \"Chaucer at the Court of Edward III\" (1847–51) by Ford Madox Brown.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2075522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075522", "title": "Battle of Kōan", "text": "Battle of Kōan\n\nThe , also known as the Second Battle of Hakata Bay, was the second attempt by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty of China to invade Japan after their failed attempt seven years earlier at the Battle of Bun'ei. In the summer of 1281, the Yuan invaded with two large armies. The Japanese defenders were aided by a major storm which sunk a sizeable portion of the Mongolian fleets. The invaders who reached the shore were repulsed shortly after landing. The Japanese called the opportune storm \"kamikaze\" (\"divine wind\"), a name later used in the Second World War for pilots who carried out aerial suicide attacks.\n\nAfter the failed first invasion by the Yuan navy, the Japanese made many defense preparations, constructing numerous fortifications along the coast. Armies of samurai trained in swordsmanship were kept in a state of readiness to repel a further attack.\n\nIn early 1280 Kublai Khan planned another invasion of Japan and ordered his shipbuilders to rebuild the whole fleet within a year. In the short time available many of the ships were poorly made; many were flat-bottomed river boats requisitioned by the Emperor.\n\nBy June 1281, 900 Yuan ships were gathered in Korea; the force was called the Eastern Route Army. They were crewed by 17,000 sailors, and transported 10,000 Korean soldiers and 15,000 Mongols and Chinese. The Southern Route Army, meanwhile, was assembled just south of the Yangtze River, in China. It is said to have consisted of 100,000 men on 3,500 ships. As before, Iki and Tsushima islands fell quickly to the much larger Yuan forces.\n\nThe Eastern Route Army arrived at Hakata Bay on June 23, and decided to proceed with the invasion without waiting for the larger Southern force which had still not left China. They were a short distance to the north and east of where their force had landed in 1274, and were in fact beyond the walls and defenses constructed by the Japanese. The samurai responded quickly, assaulting the invaders with waves of defenders, denying them the beachhead.\n\nAt night small boats carried small bands of samurai into the Yuan fleet in the bay. Under cover of darkness they boarded enemy ships, killed as many as they could, and withdrew before dawn. This harassing tactic led the Yuan forces to retreat to Tsushima, where they would wait for the Southern Route Army. However, over the course of the next several weeks, 3,000 men were killed in close quarters combat in the hot weather. Yuan forces never gained a beachhead.\n\nThe first of the Southern force ships arrived on July 16, and by August 12 the two fleets were ready to attack Japan. On August 15 a major tempest struck the Tsushima Straits, lasting two full days and destroying most of the Yuan fleet. Contemporary Japanese accounts indicate that over 4,000 ships were destroyed in the storm; 80 percent of the Yuan soldiers either drowned or were killed by samurai on the beaches. The loss of ships was so great that \"a person could walk across from one point of land to another on a mass of wreckage\".\n\nOn June 8, the Mongolian Army landed on Tsushima island and invaded. They met fierce resistance there and later withdrew. \n\nOn June 23, the Mongolians attempted a landing on Shika Island, but were unable to make significant advances. By June 24, Mongolian forces had control of most of the island, but on the morning of June 25, the Japanese army divided their force into two and attacked along Umi no Nakamichi. The Japanese army lost 300 soldiers but defeated Hong Dagu, who nearly died in this battle, and Zhang Cheng.\n\nOn June 26, Zhang Cheng solidified the defense of his army but the Mongolian army was again defeated by the fierce Japanese attacks. After this defeat the Mongolian army escaped to Iki Island.\n\nOn July 16, a Japanese army of approximately 10,000, led by the Matsura clan, Ryūzōji clan and Takagi clan began an all-out attack on Iki Island. On July 18, Ryōzōji Iekiyo (龍造寺家清) landed on Setoura beach and defeated the Mongolian army. As a result, the Mongolian army abandoned Iki Island and withdrew to Hirado Island.\n\nOn August 20, Takezaki Suenaga attacked and annihilated the Mongolian Navy. After this battle, most of the commanders of the Mongolian army escaped to their own country.\n\nOn August 22, there were about 100,000 soldiers of the Mongol army without commanders. Upon realizing this situation, the Japanese army launched an attack. Togo Korechika (都甲惟親), Togo Koretoo (都甲惟遠), Fujiwara no Sukekado (藤原資門) and Shimazu Nagahisa (島津長久) annihilated the remaining Mongolian army and took 20,000 to 30,000 prisoners in this battle.

It was conceived of by an Ogivly & Mather NYC advertising employee and introduced in 1997 by Post Cereals. In 2001 the cereal got a new recipe with real creme filling. A variation of Oreo O's called Extreme Creme Taste Oreo O's contained Oreo filling-flavored marshmallows.\n\nThe cereal was launched in 1997 and discontinued in 2007 everywhere outside South Korea. In May 2017, Post Cereals announced that it would restart production of Oreo O's starting June 23 and continue production indefinitely.\n\nSeveral advertisements were run on television for Oreo O's during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The variation Extreme Crème Oreo O's had its own television commercial starring the \"Créme Team,\" a troupe of humanoid marshmallows sporting sunglasses, in 2001. The advertisement promoted the Extreme Crème Oreo O's variation as more chocolatey in taste and creamier.\n\nThe cereal was a joint product from Post Cereals and Kraft Foods, which allowed both companies to share the rights, distribution and profits after 1997. The cereal was very successful when it came to sales, and parental approval as a suitable breakfast food. In 2007, both companies ceased co-branding, which made the cereal impossible to produce. Kraft foods owned the copyrights to the name Oreo, yet Post owned the copyrights to the cereal recipe itself. Neither company wished to relinquish either rights; therefore forcing the cereal to become discontinued worldwide.\n\nDue to an international loop hole with the rights of Oreo O's, they were only produced and available in South Korea, with boxes of the product being available for international purchase on eBay from third-party sellers for well over $10. Korean food manufacturer Dongsuh Foods was established as a joint venture of General Foods and Dongsuh Companies Inc., and had distribution rights to produce Post Foods cereals in Korea. When Kraft Foods acquired General Foods, half of Dongsuh Foods' stock automatically became property of Kraft, thus making Dongsuh Foods the only company with both licenses required to make Post Foods and Oreo O's. The product was recalled in 2014 due to Dongsuh having intentionally diluted E. coli-contaminated product with normal product. In September 2016, Dongsuh resumed selling Oreo O's within South Korea when it spun off from General Foods.\n\nIn early 2017, a subsidiary company of Post, Malt-O-Meal Cereals, continued selling the cereal in the United States as a market test. The only differences were that the marshmallows from the 2001 version were not included, the cereal contained artificial flavors and it did not use the Oreo name for licensing reasons. Instead, the cereal was called \"Cookies & Cream\" and was sold in bags in many Walmart stores. Due to high sales and a marketing deal made by Walmart, Post announced that Nabisco would once again co-brand the cereal. Soon afterward, Oreo O's were re-released with their original 1997 recipe worldwide as a Walmart Exclusive Product, including the United States on June 23. As of 2018, the cereal was available to all grocery stores. On June 17th, 2019, Walmart started selling the cereal with the marshmallows from the 2001 recipe as an exclusive product. Instead of being labeled \"Extreme Créme Oreo O's\", it was labeled \"Mega Stuf Oreo O's\".\n\n\n"}

It purports to contain secret prophecies Moses revealed to Joshua before passing leadership of the Israelites to him. It contains apocalyptic themes, but is characterized as a \"testament\", meaning it has the final speech of a dying person, Moses. \n\nThe Assumption of Moses is known from a single sixth-century incomplete manuscript in Latin that was discovered by Antonio Ceriani in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan in the mid-nineteenth century and published by him in 1861.\n\nThe two titles of this manuscript are due to different identifications with lost texts. The \"Stichometry of Nicephorus\" and some other ancient lists refer to both a \"Testament of Moses\" and an \"Assumption of Moses\", apparently as separate texts.\n\nSome ancient writers, including Gelasius (verse 2,21,17) and Origen (\"De principiis\", III,2,1), cite the \"Assumption of Moses\" with reference to the dispute over the body of Moses, referred to in the Epistle of Jude , between the archangel Michael and the devil.\n\nThis dispute does not appear in Ceriani's manuscript; this could lend support to the identification of the manuscript with the \"Testament of Moses\", but could also be explained by the text's incompleteness (it is believed that about a third of the text is missing).\n\nAn alternative explanation is that Jude is compounding material from three sources:\nThis explanation has in its favour three arguments: (1) Jude quotes from both 1 Enoch 1:9 and Zechariah 3. (2) Jeshua in Zechariah 3 is dead - his grandson is serving as high priest. The change from \"body of Jesus\" (Greek spelling of Jeshua) to \"body of Moses\" would be required to avoid confusion with Jesus, and also to reflect the historical context of Zech. 3 in Nehemiah concerning intermarriage and corruption in the \"body\" of the priesthood. (3) The example of Zech. 3 provides an argument against the \"slandering of heavenly beings\", since the Angel of the Lord does not do in Zech. 3 what Michael is reported to do in 1En1.\n\nThe text is in twelve chapters:\n\nDue to the \"vaticinia ex eventu\", most scholars date the work to the early 1st century AD, contemporary with the latest historical figures it describes. Some others, however, date it to the previous century and suggest that the 1st-century references in Chapters 6 and 10 were later insertions.\n\nBased on the literal translation of idioms within the text, it is generally accepted that the extant Latin version is a translation from Koine Greek, with the Greek itself probably a translation from Hebrew or at least a text with considerable Semitic influence.\n\nThere are no theological peculiarities to help us attribute the text to any specific Jewish group.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2075551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075551", "title": "Ultra-leftism", "text": "Ultra-leftism\n\nThe term ultra-leftism has two overlapping uses. A usage common among Marxist activist groups (\"historical ultra-left\" below) is as a generally pejorative term for certain types of positions on the far-left that are extreme or intransigent. Another definition historically refers to a particular current of Marxist communism, in which the Communist International repudiated social democratic parties (and all other progressive groupings outside of the Communist Party). Pejoratively, \"ultra-left\" is often used by Marxists against other socialists, communists, and anarchists within far-left parties who advocate strategies which some Marxists may consider to be without regard of the current political consciousness or of the long-term consequences that would result from following a proposed course.\n\nUltra-leftism within and outside the Communist International was evident in periods when political groupings pursued council communism and left communism.\n\nThe term \"ultra-left\" is rarely used in English. Instead, people tend to speak broadly of left communism as a variant of traditional Marxism. The French equivalent, \"\", has a stronger meaning in that language and is used to define a movement that still exists today: a branch of left communism developed by theorists such as Amadeo Bordiga, Otto Rühle, Anton Pannekoek, Herman Gorter, and Paul Mattick, and continuing with more recent writers, such as Jacques Camatte and Gilles Dauvé. This standpoint includes two main traditions, a Dutch-German tradition including Rühle, Pannekoek, Gorter, and Mattick, and an Italian tradition following Bordiga. These traditions came together in the 1960s French ultra-gauche. The political theorist Nicholas Thoburn refers to these traditions as the \"actuality of... the historical ultra-left\". \n\nThe term originated in the 1920s in the German and Dutch workers movements, originally referring to a Marxist group opposed to both Bolshevism and social democracy, and with some affinities with anarchism. The ultra-left is defined particularly by its breed of anti-authoritarian Marxism, which generally involves an opposition to the state and to state socialism, as well as to parliamentary democracy and wage labour. In opposition to Bolshevism, the ultra-left generally places heavy emphasis upon the autonomy and self-organization of the proletariat. As Dauvé put it:\nThe ultra-left was born and grew in opposition to Social Democracy and Leninism—which had become Stalinism. Against them, it affirmed the revolutionary spontaneity of the proletariat. The German communist left (in fact German-Dutch), and its derivatives, maintained that the only human solution lay in proletarians' own activity, without it being necessary to educate or to organize them [...] Inheriting the mantle of the ultra-left after the war, the magazine \"Socialisme ou Barbarie\" appeared in France between 1949 and 1965.\nOne variant of ultra-leftist ideas was widely revived in the New Left of the 1960s, and particularly in the May 1968 moment in libertarian socialist movements such as Big Flame, the Situationist International, and autonomism. During the May 1968 events in France, ultra-leftism was initially associated with the opposition and critique to the French Communist Party (PCF) and its cautious, relatively disengaged approach to the mobilizations. Ultra-leftism was thus used by the established currents of the communist movement to prevent, sometimes correctly, against \"self-indulgent ultra-leftism [that] could only make it more difficult for the revolutionary left to win rank and file PCF members away from their leaders″.\n\nUsed pejoratively, \"ultra-left\" is used to label positions that are adopted without taking notice of the current situation or of the consequences which would result from following a proposed course. The term is used to criticize leftist positions that, for example, are seen as overstating the tempo of events, propose initiatives that overestimate the current level of militancy, or which employ appeals to violence in their activism.\nThe mainstream Marxist critique of such a position began with Vladimir Lenin's \"\", which critiqued those (such as Anton Pannekoek or Sylvia Pankhurst) in the nascent Communist International, who argued against cooperation with parliamentary or reformist socialists. Lenin characterized the ultra-left as a politics of purity—the doctrinal \"repetition of the 'truths' of pure communism\". Leninists typically used the term against their rivals on the left: \"the Communist Party's Betty Reid wrote in a 1969 pamphlet \"Ultra-Leftism in Britain\" that the CPGB made 'no exclusive claim to be the only force on the left', but dismissed the groups to the left of the CPGB as the 'ultra-left', with Reid outlining the ultra-left as groups that were Trotskyist, anarchist or syndicalist or those that 'support the line of the Communist Party of China during the Sino-Soviet Split' (pp. 7–8)\".\n\nTrotskyists and others stated the Communist International was pursuing a strategy of unrealistic ultra-leftism during its Third Period, which the Communist International later admitted when it turned to a United Front strategy in 1934–5. The term has been popularized in the United States by the Socialist Workers Party at the time of the Vietnam war, using the term to both describe opponents in the anti-war movement including Gerry Healy. Ultra-leftism is often associated with leftist sectarianism, in which a socialist organization might attempt to put its own short-term interests before the long-term interests of the working class and its allies.\n\nThe Ultra-left of the current epoch has drifted away from its Left-Communist origins and has now adopted a decentralized orientated version of Marxism. Being combined with Communization, Autonomism, and some have even combined it with the doctrine of Stirnerite-Egoism, Creating a divide between traditional Left-Marxists and the current Ultra-Left, mostly on the issue of centralism. The current Ultra-left can be seen as a Neo-Situationist doctrine as it's heavily inspired by the works of Guy Debord and several other members of the Situationist International, some are also inspired by the works of Max Stirner and call themselves Egoist-Communists however it's optional to be an Egoist-Communist and is not needed to be a current-day Ultra.\n\n\n\n"}

It was nominated for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2004.\n\nSet in the late 1980s, the story is written from the perspective of David Zimmer, a university professor who, after losing his wife and children in a plane crash, falls into a routine of depression and isolation. After seeing one of the silent comedies of Hector Mann, an actor missing since the 1920s, he decides to occupy himself by watching all of Mann's films and writing a book about them. The publishing of the book, however, triggers another series of events that draw Zimmer even deeper into the actor's past.\n\nThe middle of the story is largely dedicated to telling the life story of Hector Mann, involving his self-imposed exile from his past life and career, which serves as a form of penance for his role in the death of a woman who loved him. In his last days, Mann's wife sends a letter to Zimmer, requesting him to come to their New Mexico home to bear witness to Mann's final legacy of films. The events that ensue form the overarching story of Zimmer's rehabilitation from his reclusive state, and his coming to terms with the manner in which his family was killed.\n\nThe book makes many direct references to the autobiography of François-René de Chateaubriand, \"Mémoires d'outre-tombe\"; one of Zimmer's ongoing projects is producing a new translation of the book.\n\nDavid Zimmer appears in Auster's earlier novel \"Moon Palace\".\n\n\"The Book of Illusions\" revisits a number of plot elements seen in Auster's first major work, \"The New York Trilogy\". These include:\n\nIn addition, the book also bears the stylistic distinction of not using quotation marks; Auster has previously used this in \"Ghosts\", the second book of \"The New York Trilogy\" and \"Travels in the Scriptorium\". He also does this in his later book, \"Invisible\"\n\n\"The Silent World of Hector Mann\" is an album by Duke Special inspired by the character Hector Mann with each song themselves based on a film each written by a different songwriter.\n\nJames Wood, a critic of Auster's work, nevertheless named it as 'probably his best novel.' He praised Auster's 'painstaking and vivid fictional re-creation of the career of a silent-movie actor of the nineteen twenties.' However, he says the novel 'soon hurtles into absurdity.' \n"}

He has one older brother, Andrew Dyson, and a younger sister, Jayne Dyson. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School, now The Grammar School at Leeds. He studied Philosophy at the University of Leeds and later completed an MA in screenwriting at the Northern Film School. He lived in Highbury, London, but now lives in Ilkley, West Yorkshire.\n\nDyson is best known as co-creator of the hit West End play \"Ghost Stories\", and as a member of the sketch comedy team The League of Gentlemen, the latter along with fellow performers Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, and Reece Shearsmith, all of whom he met while they were studying at Bretton Hall drama school.\n\nThe League of Gentlemen initially began as a stage act in 1995, which then was transferred to BBC Radio 4 in 1997 as \"On the Town with the League of Gentlemen\", and then became a television series on BBC Two in 1999. The latter saw Dyson and his colleagues awarded a British Academy Television Award, a Royal Television Society Award, and the prestigious Golden Rose of Montreux.\n\nDyson has written several books including \"Bright Darkness: Lost Art of the Supernatural Horror Film\", a non-fiction guide to horror films, and two collections of short stories entitled \"Never Trust a Rabbit\" – short-listed for the Macmillan Silver Pen award – and \"The Cranes That Build The Cranes\" which won the 2010 Edge Hill award.

The ships were delivered to the United States Navy on 14 July 1846, and \"Spitfire\" was commissioned on 21 August 1846, Commander Josiah Tattnall in command.\n\nAfter carrying dispatches for United States forces in California to Chagres, Panama, \"Spitfire\" joined the American blockading force off Vera Cruz on 10 November; and, as she was a new and efficient vessel designed specifically for service on Mexico's Gulf Coast, she significantly strengthened Commodore David Conner's squadron.\n\nOn the 12th, the small side wheel gunboat got underway with the squadron for an expedition against Tampico. The American ships gathered off Tampico bar on the morning of the 14th. At 10:45, Conner boarded \"Spitfire\" and used her as his flagship during the attack which they opened at about 11:00 by firing a gun.\n\n\"Spitfire\" joined other light draft vessels of the squadron and boats from the heavier American warships in moving across the bar and up the Pánuco River and past the fort which guarded the stream. In the early afternoon, a delegation from the city boarded \"Spitfire\" to discuss surrender. No agreement was reached; but, after a landing party had occupied the town, Conner decided that no formal capitulation was necessary.\n\nTwo days later, boats from \"Spitfire\" and \"Vixen\" ascended the Panuco and captured three small Mexican gunboats. On the 18th, \"Spitfire\" and schooner went further up the river and captured the town of Pánuco the next morning. They also destroyed nine Mexican 18-pounders, threw a large supply of 18-pound shot in the river, and burned military stores before heading downstream on the 21st.\n\nOn 25 November, after a \"norther\" sank \"Neptune\" at Tampico, \"Spitfire\" rescued that steamer's crew without loss of life. On 13 December, Conner departed Tampico in Princeton and left Commander Tattnall in charge there until enough Army troops arrived to hold the town. Thus, \"Spitfire\" did not return to Vera Cruz until 3 January 1847.\n\nPreparations were soon underway for operations against that important port city. On 9 March, \"Spitfire\" led a flotilla of gunboats and other light draft naval vessels close to the shore to support the landing of Army troops who began to invest the city.\n\nJust after dawn the following day, \"Spitfire\" anchored east of the fortress at San Juan de Ulúa and opened fire on the castle to divert the attention of the Mexicans from General Winfield Scott who shifted his headquarters ashore that morning. After an engagement lasting about 30 minutes, \"Spitfire\" withdrew out of range of the Mexican cannon.\n\nThe days that followed were devoted to preparations for a siege of the city. At mid-afternoon on the 22nd, when the cannonading began, \"Spitfire\" led Josiah Tattnall's flotilla in an attack on the shore end of the city walls and maintained the bombardment until dark. The steamer's fire was praised as being especially accurate and effective. During the action, the batteries in the fortress fired on the flotilla, but its ships were undamaged.\n\nThat night, \"Spitfire's\" executive officer, Lt. David Dixon Porter, made a daring boat reconnaissance of the harbor at Vera Cruz to locate the best position for the flotilla when it resumed its shelling.\n\nThe next morning, Tattnall sailed his gunboats within grape-shot range of Fort Santiago and opened fire on both the town and the fort. The Mexican guns replied but were unable to depress their pieces sufficiently to hit the fearless American gunboats.\n\nAfter the surrender of Vera Cruz, \"Spitfire\" participated in the expedition against Alvarado and the capture of Tuxpan as Commodore Matthew C. Perry's flagship.\n\nOn 14 June, she was part of the force which took Frontera at the mouth of the Tabasco River. The American ships then ascended the river, engaged Mexican batteries at three points on the Tabasco, and occupied the city of the same name on the 16th. The American warships remained until 22 July when they headed down river toward the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBut, by this time most of the fighting of the Navy in the Gulf of Mexico had ceased. After routine duties protecting Army supply lines and communication, \"Spitfire\" returned home and was sold at Norfolk in 1848.\n\n"}

Then, the kids introduce the visitor to the cereal, winning over the visitor, examining the size of the cereal bits with a tape measure and singing the jingle:\n\nDuring the 1980s, the cereal offered the Honeycomb Hideout Club for children, distributing badges, membership cards and clubhouse toy incentives on specially marked box tops.\n\nThe jingle was spoofed on the \"Futurama\" episode entitled \"The Sting\" in 2003.\n\nHoneycomb Kid sought what he called \"The Honeycomb Secret.\" Honeycomb Kid had learned from his prior adventures that the secret consisted of three separate parts: The first was the Crunch, the second was the Shape, however the third and most important answer had always eluded him. In the last installment of his first commercial appearances, Honeycomb Kid discovers the third component of the Honeycomb secret to be the Taste.\n\nA new set of Honeycomb Kid commercials were made in the 1980s where a child athlete would get done practicing then come up to a table with Honeycomb cereal, exclaim it was his or her favorite cereal, to where the older guys at the table would somewhat mock the \"little kid\" or \"little guy\" for wanting \"big Honeycomb\", to where the kid would go, \"Little kid (guy)?! Watch this!\" then go and show off his or her skills to them, thoroughly impressing them (saying \"Big stuff!\" and \"Honeycomb kid!\" as they watch) and being accepted by them (\"I didn't know you were a Honeycomb kid!\") and the commercial ends with the kid happily eating a bowl of Honeycomb.\n\nIn 1995, a mascot, Crazy Craving, was introduced as a wild-haired, marsupial-like cartoon character who rabidly craves Honeycomb cereal and whom children in the commercials transform into. Its catch-phrase was \"Me Want Honeycomb\". The name Crazy Craving means that the character is the anthropomorphism of hunger.\n\nA more recent commercial introduces Bernard, a boy raised by bees. He is found and attempted to be socialized. Although he had clearly been a feral child, he apparently cannot argue the fact that he is a 'bee' not a 'boy,' and he enjoys Honeycomb. In a later commercial, a man gives a safari-like tour for the bee boy, luring him with Honeycomb. In a commercial released in 2010, a second bee boy was introduced played by Canadian actor Joel Cox.\n\nHoneycomb was famous in the 1980s for their annual mini-license plate giveaway, where a miniature state license plate was free inside a box, with the ability to order the whole set. One year, Post also included plates that said \"LUCKY\" and the finder of those plates won a BMX bike. The commercial for this showed a girl winning and later riding the BMX bike, which was considered somewhat unusual for the time.\n\n"}

The station is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company. The KRDC broadcast license is held by ABC Radio Los Angeles Assets, LLC.\n\nKRDC, formerly Radio Disney station KDIS, was broadcast in the HD (hybrid) format until late 2014 when all Radio Disney affiliates were sold except for the Los Angeles station which returned to analog transmissions. KRDC is still licensed for digital (HD) operation.\n\n1110 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency.\n\nThe station initially signed on as KPAS in 1942, a station featuring popular music. In 1945 it took the call sign KXLA, playing country music. On-air personalities included Tennessee Ernie Ford and Stan Freberg. The station originally broadcast from its El Monte transmitter site, near Santa Anita Ave and the Pomona, or \"60\" Freeway, in the vicinity of the Peck Road exit.\n\nThe station later became KRLA, \"The Big 11-10\", on September 1, 1959, and became one of the top radio stations in the Los Angeles area, competing with KFWB and later KHJ to be L.A.'s dominant top 40 station. The on-air personalities included Dave Hull (The Hullabalooer), Emperor Bob Hudson, Ted Quillin, Rebel Foster, Jimmy Rabbitt, Casey Kasem, Bob Eubanks, Dick Biondi, Sam Riddle, Dick Moreland, Jimmy O'Neill, Wink Martindale, and Johnny Hayes. In 1968, news director Lew Irwin created The Credibility Gap, which broadcast topical comedy along with the news. In 1969, John Gilliland debuted the Pop Chronicles music documentary. The 1969 film \"The Model Shop\" features a radio newscast by Ralph Thompson, KRLA. During the 1960s, the KRLA studio was just off the parking lot of the old Huntington Sheraton Hotel on Oak Knoll Drive in Pasadena, making it possible to drop by and watch the on-air DJ do his show. When the station switched to oldies, KRLA was noted for its prominence in Southern California Chicano culture. One of the highlights of this station was the \"Big 11 Countdown Show\" hosted by Johnny Hayes, with stories and facts about the songs and the artists, as well as the historical events that were going on at that time. The show also included a trivia question that Hayes asked for people to call in with their answer in order to win a prize. Each day's show counted down the top 11 songs from that date in a previous year as well as a few extras. \n\nThe station evolved to an adult contemporary format by 1982, and focused on oldies by 1983. They dropped current music in 1984, electing to play the oldies of the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.\n\nBy 1994, KRLA leaned towards an urban oldies format.\n\nOn February 25, 1997, CBS Radio announced that it would trade WMMR in Philadelphia, and WOAZ and WBOS in Boston to Greater Media in exchange for KRLA and sister station KLSX, as part of its acquisition of Infinity Broadcasting Corporation. The swap was completed on August 22.\n\nAt Noon on November 30, 1998, KRLA abandoned music entirely and went all talk. As a talk radio station, KRLA featured many cast-offs from KABC, such as Michael Jackson and Ken Minyard, as well as Don Imus, Dr. Toni Grant, G. Gordon Liddy, Ron Barr's \"Sports Byline USA\", and Ed Tyll. The station also aired play-by-play of the Kings and Angels.\n\nIn 2000, Infinity sold KRLA (alongside KRAK in Sacramento) to the Burbank-based Walt Disney Company due to ownership limits. On December 1, the station became the ESPN Radio outlet for the Los Angeles market (as KSPN). Disney completed the acquisition on March 1, 2001.\n\nAM 710 and 1110 swapped formats on January 1, 2003, with the sports format moving to 710, and Radio Disney moving to 1110 (a change made reportedly because the 1110 signal could not be heard in Orange County at night, when Anaheim Angels games are played).\n\nIn May 2014, Mediabase moved KDIS to the Top 40/CHR panel, although Radio Disney is still considered a children's station.\n\nOn August 13, 2014, it was revealed that all of Radio Disney's remaining stations, excluding KDIS, were to be sold in an effort to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. KDIS was retained to serve as the originator of Radio Disney's programming, and its operations were assumed by the network's national staff.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, KDIS changed call letters to KRDC and flipped to a country format as \"Radio Disney Country\", becoming the first terrestrial radio station carrying the formerly online-only platform. KRDC also added a translator, 99.1 K256CX, which broadcasts from KRDC's transmitter in Irwindale. The children's radio/contemporary hit radio hybrid continued in the market on KRTH's HD2 subchannel until Entercom's deal with Radio Disney expired at the end of May 2018.\n\nIn 1987, KRLA moved its transmitter site from South El Monte to Irwindale, where a similar antenna array was installed.\nDuring the 1990s, KRLA was authorized to increase nighttime power from 10,000 to 20,000 watts. When the power increase went into effect, KRLA started broadcasting from the new transmitter site in Irwindale. This is a few miles north of the old El Monte site.\n\nThe El Monte transmitter building still stands as a shell. The entire inside is burned out; however, there are still clues to its historic past, namely the first incarnation of its directional antenna arrays (four in-line 135-degree towers, one days, four nights), the second incarnation (four 135-degree towers in a parallelogram, days and a 90-, two 135-, and a 180-degree towers, nights), and the last incarnation, with seven total towers, four days and four nights, with one tower in common, days and nights). There are numerous ducts to keep the equipment cool and an underground channel to divert the cooling water for the transmitters. A well nearby supplied the water. Still visible is the wooden archway where the transmission cables gently bent toward underground conduits running to the transmission towers in the nearby field. All that remains of these towers are the concrete pylons, all aligned as described.\n\nThe present Irwindale site includes five 135-degree towers, two days and four nights, with one in common. The significantly northern location, relative to the old El Monte site, allows the large \"Inland Empire\" to be served with 50,000 watts and only two towers, \"not\" four, days, and the greater Los Angeles metro to be served with 20,000 watts and four towers, nights.\n\nK256CX is a broadcast translator licensed to Beaumont, California. The transmitter is located in Irwindale. The station went on the air June 9, 2017, and rebroadcasts KRDC on 99.1 MHz.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted an original construction permit on December 6, 2013, to build an FM translator (K293BZ, now K256CX) licensed in Beaumont, California, and located in the 106.5 MHz frequency, which would rebroadcast KWVE-FM in San Clemente.\n\nOn October 18, 2016, KDIS's licensee ABC Radio Los Angeles Assets agreed to acquire from the Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa the permit with the intention to rebroadcast the AM station for $45,000. On November 8, the FCC, as part of the AM revitalization program, granted a modification to move the transmitter location to Irwindale (although the translator will maintain Beaumont as its license city) and change the frequency to 99.1.\nThe transaction was closed on February 7, 2017.\n\nFollowing the launch of K256CX and KDIS' switch to Radio Disney Country as KRDC on June 9, 2017, Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters, owner of existing country music station KKGO, said in a statement welcoming the station that the translator would mainly cover the San Gabriel Valley and that the FCC had also authorized another station on the 99.1 FM frequency in Long Beach.\n\n"}

Rebuilt and enlarged for use as a cruise terminal, it also served as a multi-story shopping centre.

{"id": "2075646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075646", "title": "WFME (AM)", "text": "WFME (AM)\n\nWFME (1560 AM) is a non-commercial traditional Christian radio station licensed to New York City; it operates as a Class A clear-channel station broadcasting at the maximum power for AM radio, 50,000 watts The station is owned and operated by Family Radio, a Christian radio ministry based in Nashville, Tennessee and broadcasts the Family Radio - East satellite feed from its transmitter located in Maspeth, Queens. WFME airs several Christian ministry broadcasts from noted teachers such as RC Sproul, Alistair Begg, Ken Ham, John F. MacArthur, Adriel Sanchez, Dennis Rainey, John Piper, & others as well as traditional and modern hymns & songs by Keith & Kristyn Getty, The Master's Chorale, Fernando Ortega, Chris Rice, Shane & Shane, Sovereign Grace Music, Sara Groves, & multiple other Christian and Gospel music artists.\n\nWFME began operations as W2XR, an experimental television station, owned by inventor John V. L. Hogan, operating at 2100 kHz, which went on the air on March 26, 1929. Hogan was a radio engineer who owned many patents, and wanted a permit for an experimental station. To avoid interference, the frequency granted in 1934 by the Federal Radio Commission was considerably above the normal broadcasting range, which at that time ended at 1500 kilocycles. Hogan's permit was one of four construction permits; the others, all granted on the same day, were W1XBS Waterbury and W9XBY Kansas City, both on 1530 kHz, and W6XAI Bakersfield, which shared 1550 kHz with W2XR. W2XR was licensed as an \"experimental broadcast station\" on June 29, 1934. But Hogan was also a connoisseur of music, and he drew on his own record collection to provide the sound for his experiments, which typically lasted for an hour in the evening. W2XR began to broadcast Classical music recordings on 1550 kHz. His television broadcasts came to naught, but Hogan began to hear from unknown individuals who encouraged him to continue broadcasting music.\n\nIn 1936, Hogan and Elliott Sanger formed the Interstate Broadcasting Company, with the intention of turning W2XR into a commercial station at a time when there were already about twenty-five radio stations in New York. The transmitter, which used a homemade antenna mounted on a wooden pole, was located in a garage in Long Island City, near the Queensborough Bridge, and its 250 watts provided just enough power to reach midtown Manhattan and parts of Queens. On December 3, 1936, W2XR became WQXR, the cursive form of the letter \"Q\" mimics the number \"2\". An FM service, W2XQR, was added in 1939. The North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement of 1941 formally extended the AM band to 1600 kHz, ending the \"high-fidelity\" service but keeping all four original stations near their existing dial positions. WQXR was originally slated to move to 1600 as a five-kilowatt class III-A regional station, but was able to persuade the FCC to make it a class I-B station on 1560 kHz instead.\n\nThe \"New York Post\" approached the company in the early 1940s about purchasing the stations. Sanger said publicly that he would have preferred to sell to \"The New York Times\", and in early 1944, the \"Times\" agreed to pay just over $1 million for ownership of Interstate Broadcasting Company. A transfer application was filed with the FCC on March 1, 1944, including a financial statement showing that the stations had made over $22,000 in profits the previous year, on revenues of $411,000; after FCC approval, the sale was completed on July 25, 1944. (The \"Times\" continued to operate its radio stations under the Interstate Broadcasting name for many years, maintaining what its president called \"basic good-music policies,\" but later used the name \"The New York Times Radio Company\".) It broadcast classical music full-time, along with \"New York Times\" news. At 9 PM, the newspaper having been \"put to bed\", the station would broadcast a brief discussion of the news which would appear on the front page of the next day's issue.\nWQXR was the first AM station in New York to experiment with broadcasting in stereo, beginning in 1952. During some of its live concerts, it used two microphones positioned six feet apart. The microphone on the right led to its AM feed, and the one on the left to its FM feed, so a listener could position two radios six feet apart, one tuned to 1560 and the other to 96.3, and listen in stereo.\n\nIn 1964, there was controversy when its 11 PM program \"Nightcap\" was sponsored by \"Schenley\" Liquors. Advertising hard liquor was considered a violation of the voluntary NAB standards.\n\nIn 1965, the FCC began requiring commonly owned AM and FM stations in large markets to broadcast separate programming for at least part of the day. WQXR-FM concentrated on longer classical works, while WQXR (AM) aired lighter Classical music and talk programs produced in conjunction with \"The New York Times\". While this plan gave Classical music fans in the New York area two options, it also increased expenses for the stations.\n\nIn 1971, the \"Times\" put WQXR-AM-FM up for sale. Many offers were received for the FM station, but none of the bids for 1560 AM were satisfactory to management. When the FCC agreed to waive rules prohibiting stations from simulcasting if they were broadcasting classical music, the \"Times\" took the WQXR stations off the market. Simulcasting was also allowed, for example, for WGMS and WGMS-FM in Washington.\n\nOn December 2, 1992, the AM side broke away from the simulcast for good, changing to an American popular standards format, which was inaugurated by a live studio performance by Tony Bennett. The change came a few months after WNEW (1130 AM), New York's heritage popular standards station, announced an impending sale to Bloomberg L.P. and a format switch to business information with the new call letters WBBR. The format change at 1560 to standards happened 10 days before WNEW's transition. To reflect the heritage of both outlets, WQXR (AM) changed its call sign to WQEW. The station focused on a broad range of pop standards–the format's foundation artists including Frank Sinatra, Nat \"King\" Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Dean Martin and Perry Como, but also artists from the big band era (such as Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington); and non-rock-and-roll pop hits (by artists like Neil Diamond, Barbra Streisand, Ray Charles, Bobby Darin and Pat Boone, among others). Light rock'n'roll material such as the Turtles was also occasionally heard.\n\nAlthough initially successful, the station's advertising revenues were not spectacular, and older audience demographics were deemed undesirable for long-term success. On December 3, 1998, the \"Times\" announced that WQEW would switch to Radio Disney after agreeing to what was initially an eight-year local marketing agreement term with the Walt Disney Company and its ABC Radio subsidiary. The entire WQEW air staff, under orders to not discuss the pending changes on the air, was released on December 21; the station played Christmas music without announcers through the holiday. Regular programming resumed on December 26 and ended on December 27 at 11:59 p.m., when a pre-recorded signoff read by program director and air personality Stan Martin was played. Radio Disney programming launched on WQEW on December 28, 1998.\n\nAt the end of the agreement with the \"Times\" in late 2006, Disney had the option to purchase the station or to extend the arrangement with the \"Times\" maintaining ownership. Disney exercised the option to purchase in early January 2007. Disney/ABC officially became the owner of the station on May 24, 2007.\n\nOn August 13, 2014, Disney announced its intention to end terrestrial distribution of the Radio Disney format, in order to focus on digital distribution. Disney would also sell its remaining Radio Disney broadcast outlets, including WQEW and with the lone exception of KDIS in Los Angeles. Disney set a deadline of September 26, 2014 to complete the sales or have deals in principle set or the stations in question, including WQEW, would fall silent. However, Disney backtracked and the stations would remain on the air, continuing to broadcast Radio Disney programming until each were sold.\n\nOn November 21, 2014, Oakland, California-based Family Stations announced it would purchase WQEW from Disney/ABC for $12.95 million. The transaction had been rumored for at least a month, as it was originally reported by the \"New York Daily News\" on October 14, 2014; however, Disney had clarified that it had not yet agreed to the sale. In January 2013 Family Radio sold the original, Newark, New Jersey-licensed WFME (94.7 FM, which it had owned since 1966 but had been programming since 1963) to Cumulus Media, who converted the station into country music-formatted WNSH. In what amounted to a station trade-plus-cash transaction, Family Stations also acquired the license for WDVY (106.3 FM) in Mount Kisco, New York. The 106.3 FM signal, combined in tandem with Family Radio-owned WFRH (91.7 FM) in Kingston, New York mainly serves the Hudson Valley region; another Family Radio outlet, WFRS (88.9 FM) in Smithtown, New York serves Long Island. This left Family Radio programming unavailable over-the-air in New York City proper and northern New Jersey (including Newark) for over two years.\n\nAfter the FCC approved the sale on February 10, 2015, 1560 AM went silent on February 17 in preparation of the format change. The sale was finalized on February 20 and the call sign was changed to WFME. The station returned to the air on February 27, again giving Family Radio full coverage of the New York City market. Concurrent with the sale, the FCC converted 1560 AM's broadcast license status from commercial to non-commercial educational.\nSince the initial move from 94.7 in 2013, WFME's originating role with the Family Radio network has been reduced; the station previously originated a portion of the network's overnight program \"Nightwatch\", which was hosted by now-retired station manager/chief engineer Charlie Menut. The entirety of the station's schedule originates from Family Radio headquarters (which in 2016 moved from Oakland to nearby Alameda, California), although WFME does carry local programming to comply with the FCC's public affairs requirements.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lardner was appointed midshipman on May 10, 1820. He served in the Pacific Squadron from 1821 to 1824, and joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1825 after escorting General Lafayette in back to France.\n\nHe received promotion to lieutenant on May 17, 1828, and served as navigating officer of the sloop on her historic circumnavigation, and then served on the flagships of the Mediterranean, Brazil and Pacific Squadrons. In 1850 he sailed for the coast of Africa in the brig and was promoted to commander on May 17, 1851. Lardner spent three years as commander of \"Porpoise\" and the sloop-of-war in the Africa Squadron before returning to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1853. He was promoted to the rank of captain, on May 19, 1861.\n\nIn September 1861, during the Civil War, Lardner, in command of the frigate , took a pertinent part in the Battle of Port Royal and the capture of Forts Walker and Beauregard. He was commended for gallantry in action by Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont; his name was sent to Congress for a vote of thanks by President Abraham Lincoln. In May 1862, he assumed command of the East Gulf Blockading Squadron and was promoted to commodore on July 16, 1862. In December 1862 he returned to Philadelphia to recover from a severe attack of yellow fever. From May 1863 to October 1864, Lardner commanded the West India Squadron.\n\nAfter his retirement on November 20, 1864, he was appointed rear admiral on July 25, 1866.

She is listed as one of the Seven Archangels in Pseudo-Dionysian teachings.\n\nAccording to the pseudepigraphal Revelation of Moses, another name for Jophiel is Dina. Jophiel/Dina is described as an angel of the seventh heaven, a Cabalistic guardian of the Torah (and wisdom itself), who taught 70 languages to souls at the dawn of creation. The Zohar lists her as a Great Angel Chief in charge of 53 legions who superintend Torah-readings on the Sabbath. Jophiel is said to be a companion to the angel Metatron.\n\nC.E. Clement, in his book 'Angels in Art,' names Jophiel as the teacher of Ham, Japheth, and Shem. Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Thomas Rudd likewise name Jophiel as the teacher of Shem.\n\nIn Anglican and Episcopal traditions, Jophiel is recognized as an archangel. She is often depicted in iconography holding a flaming sword, such as the stained glasses at St Michael's Church in Brighton, St Peter and St John's Church in Kirkley, Holy Trinity Church in Coventry and a mural at St. John's Episcopal Church in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nJophiel is an Archangel of the Kabbalah (though some systems put Raziel in her place) and in several listings including that of the early medieval theologian Pseudo-Dionysus. The Calendarium Naturale Magicum Perpetuum lists Jophiel as the angel of the Sephira Chokhmah, as do the Key of Solomon variant \"The Veritable Clavicles of Solomon,\" and the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses, both latter works derived from the \"Calendarium\". Agrippa attributes Jophiel to Saturn, while Paracelsus assigns her to Jupiter. Rudd attributes the Zodiac to Jophiel along with the Sephira Binah instead of Zaphkiel. Athanasius Kircher names Jophiel as , \"angel of beauty\". According to Robert Ambelain, Jophiel is in charge of the Cherubim, particularly the Shemhamphorasch angels Haziel, Aladiah, Lauviah, Hahaiah, Iezalel, Mehahel, Hariel, and Hakamiah.\n\n\"Angels of Love and Light\" describes her as \"the Archangel of Paradise and the Patron of Artists and Illumination.

Rabbinical tradition considers him to be the angel of mercy.\nIn rabbinic writings Zadkiel belongs to the order of Hashmallim (equated with the Dominations or Dominions), and considered by some sources to be chief of that order (others sources name Hashmal or Zacharael). In \"Maseket Azilut\" Zadkiel/Hesediel is listed as co-chief with Gabriel of the order of \"Shinanim\". As an angel of mercy, some texts claim that Zadkiel is the unnamed biblical Angel of the Lord who holds back Abraham to prevent the patriarch from sacrificing his son, and because of this is usually shown holding a dagger. Other texts cite Michael or \"Tadhiel\" or some other angel as the angel intended, while others interpret the Angel of the Lord as a theophany.\n\nZadkiel is one of two standard bearers (along with Jophiel) who follow directly behind Michael as the head archangel enters battle. Zadkiel is associated with the color violet. In iconography, he is often depicted holding a knife or dagger.\n\nIn Jewish mysticism and Western ritual magic, Zadkiel is associated with the planet Jupiter. The angel's position in the Sephirot is fourth, which corresponds to mercy.\n\n"}

{"id": "2075794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075794", "title": "Follyfoot", "text": "Follyfoot\n\nFollyfoot was a children's television series co-produced by the majority-partner British television company Yorkshire Television (for transmission on ITV) and the independent West German company \"TV Munich\" (for transmission on the ZDF channel). It aired in the United Kingdom between 1971 and 1973, repeated for two years after that and again in the late 1980s. The series starred Gillian Blake in the lead role. Notable people connected with the series were actors Desmond Llewelyn and Arthur English and directors Jack Cardiff, Stephen Frears, Michael Apted and David Hemmings.\n\nIt was originally inspired by Monica Dickens' 1963 novel \"Cobbler's Dream\" (republished in 1995 as \"New Arrival at Follyfoot\"); she later wrote four further books in conjunction with the series—\"Follyfoot\" in 1971, \"Dora at Follyfoot\" in 1972, \"The Horses of Follyfoot\" in 1975, and \"Stranger at Follyfoot\" in 1976.\n\nThe series, which was filmed on the Harewood family estate, was set at a home of rest for horses. Despite an apparent appeal limited to young girls with an equine interest, \"Follyfoot\" was actually aimed squarely at the teenage market and often had challenging things to say about the treatment of horses and animals generally in British society. The ethos of \"Follyfoot\" generally was to give another chance to both horses and people who had been rejected by the rest of society: the stance of the series was recognisably pro-animal, and characters who resembled the archetypes of the Pullein-Thompson sisters et al. were overwhelmingly shown in a negative light. Continuity in the series was assured by the use of mostly one writer, Tony Essex (writing under the pen name Francis Stevens), but there were also contributions from Rosemary Anne Sisson.\n\nThe series' theme song, \"The Lightning Tree\", written by Steven Francis (pen name of Francis Essex, the brother of Tony Essex) and sung by The Settlers, is well-remembered, sometimes more so than the series itself. The song reached No. 36 in the UK charts. An album featuring music from the series was also released.\n\nThe main actors were Gillian Blake as Dora, Steve Hodson as Steve, Christian Rodska as Ron Stryker, Desmond Llewelyn as the Colonel and Arthur English as Slugger. Several other famous people had minor roles, one being Pam St Clement, the others being Gretchen Franklin as the Colonel's housekeeper and Kathy Staff in two separate bit parts. But what really characterised the series was its rotation of directors, many of whom have since become revered figures in the UK film industry, including Stephen Frears, Michael Apted and even Jack Cardiff who took time out from working overseas with Kirk Douglas to direct two episodes of the series. Also, in the third series, most notably, David Hemmings took the time to appear in one episode, \"Uncle Joe\" and also to direct two other episodes which took place before and after that episode: \"The Bridge Builder\" and the final episode, \"Walk In the Wood\".\n\nThe series proved to be very popular and was sold to many countries at the time of the original UK transmission. The first series won the Harlequin award for best production at the 1972 BAFTA Awards, while the second series episode, \"The Debt\", reached the top 20 in the weekly television ratings—a rarity for an afternoon-timeslot show. During production for the third series, it was intended that this would be the last, a film version of \"Follyfoot\" was planned, but the idea was ultimately shelved. The children's magazine \"Look-in\" featured a picture-strip of the series each week as well as regular features, while five annuals were released in association with Yorkshire Television. These ran until 1976—long after the series had finished.\n\nFollifoot (note the slightly different spelling) is a small village just three miles from Harrogate, not far from the Yorkshire Television studios in Leeds.\n\n\n\nThe first three episodes were released on video in 1995. No further releases ever came to light, and this video has long been deleted.\n\nHowever, on DVD, Series 1 (episodes 1 to 13) was released in 2007. Series 2 was released on DVD in April 2008, with Series 3 following in October 2008. The DVDs are Region 2 encoded, and in PAL format. A complete boxset of the series was released in late 2008.\n\n"}

It is the first book published in the \"Dalemark Quartet\", although chronologically it is the third in the series, coming in time hundreds of years after \"The Spellcoats\" and a year or so after \"Drowned Ammet\".\n\nOsfameron Tanamoril (Moril) Clennenson is a travelling musician, who travels with his father, Clennen, his mother, Lenina, and his elder siblings, Dagner and Brid, through Dalemark, a country torn by civil war between the South and the North. They travel around, playing music, taking passengers and messages, and spreading news throughout the country.\n\nWhen Clennen (the father and main performer) is murdered by the Earl of South Dales, who suspects him of being a spy for the North, Lenina (who is high-born and gave up the chance of being a Lady when she married Clennen) takes her three children and their passenger Kialan, the fugitive son of a Northern earl, back to her home town of Markind in South Dalemark. Within the same day as her husband's death, Lenina is married to her former fiancé the Lord of Markind, guided by the belief that this is the only way to counter the bad luck caused by Clennen's murder.\n\nDagner, Brid, and Moril encounter their father's murderer among the wedding guests in Markind and together with Kialan they flee the town and try to reach the North, while continuing to perform for a living. However, without Clennen and Lenina, they find this difficult to do. The oldest son, Dagner, tries to continue their father's work as a Northern spy, but is arrested for treason against the Earl of South Dales. Brid, Moril, and Kialan are forced to flee, believing that Dagner will be hanged.\n\nBefore he died, Clennen left his youngest son Moril a magical cwidder (a common musical instrument in Dalemark similar to a lute with some properties of an acoustic guitar). It is rumoured to have been owned by Moril's ancestor and namesake Osfameron, who was both a minstrel and a famous magician, featuring in many of the legends of Dalemark. Throughout their travels from the South to the North, Moril discovers that he has the power to use the magic of his newly inherited instrument.\n\nAs they travel, they become embroiled in the civil war. As the Southerners are about to attack the North, Moril uses his magical cwidder to make the mountains 'walk' and close Flennpass, the only mountain pass between the North and the South, just as his ancestor, the famed Osfameron, did in so many of the songs Moril's father had sung nearly every day. The walking mountains crush the attacking Southern army, killing the evil Earl of South Dales, Clennen's murderer, and saving the North. However, after the battle, Moril is wracked with guilt, as he caused the deaths of hundreds of men, and mainly because he was angry that his beloved horse, Olob, had been shot.\n\nIn the end, when all safely reach Hannart, the earldom of Kialan's father, they are joined by Dagner who has been released from jail after the death of the Earl of South Dales and travelled to North Dalemark with another travelling Singer, Hestefan. Moril decides that he should travel with Hestefan and learn how to be a proper Singer. Hestefan accepts, and they leave to continue travelling through Dalemark.\n\n\nThe novel's title refers to the \"cart\" in which Singers travel around South and North Dalemark and the \"cwidder\", a lute-like string instrument played by Singers as an accompaniment to their songs and stories.\n\n"}

It is a distant relative of its 18th-century predecessor, konfederatka (because of use by members of the Bar Confederation), although similar caps have been used by light cavalry since the 14th century. It consists of a four-pointed top and a short peak, usually made of black or brown leather. Although rogatywka (derived from róg which means horn or corner) in English seems to mean the same as czapka, the word 'czapka' in Polish designates not only rogatywka, but all caps (not hats).\n\nThe rogatywka usually comes in two variants: the hardened and soft version. \nThe hardened model, based on the rogatywka Mk. 1935, olive green with black peak, is used in full gala uniforms, while the rim colour marks unit type (for example, navy blue - typical, scarlet - military police, green - artillery, and so on). It was not worn during most of the People's Republic of Poland era but was reintroduced for ceremonial wear by the Honour Guard Company in 1983. The soft version was used before World War II and during the People's Republic of Poland period for garrison dress; it was withdrawn after 1990.\n\nPolish soldiers, unlike those of most military forces, decorate their caps not with the emblem of their corps, but with their service's version of the Polish military eagle. The military eagle insignia is based on an early 19th-century design, comprising a modified White Eagle (from the Polish coat of arms) perched atop an 'amazon shield'.\n\nArmy branches are indicated by the following colored cap bands:\n\nThe rogatywka is used by Polish firefighters (hardened, all navy blue) and Polish State Railways staff (soft, navy blue or red).\n\nGreen rogatywkas with brown leather peak and scout Fleur-de-lis symbol are traditionally worn by Polish boy scouts, while grey caps are sometimes used by girl guides.\n"}

It can be found from Australia to Japan and India.\n\nThe oriental dollarbird was originally described in the genus \"Coracias\". Formerly, some authorities have also considered the broad-billed roller and the azure dollarbird to have been subspecies of the oriental dollarbird. Alternate names for the oriental dollarbird include the Asian dollarbird, dark roller, dollar roller, dollarbird, eastern broad-billed roller and oriental broad-billed roller.\n\nTen subspecies are recognized: \n\nThe oriental dollarbird has a length of up to 30 cm. It is dark brown but this is heavily washed with a bluish-green sheen on the back and wing coverts. Its belly and undertail coverts are light coloured, and it has glossy bright blue colouring on its throat and undertail. Its flight feathers are a darker blue. Its bill is short and wide and in mature animals is coloured orange-red with a black tip. It has very light blue patches on the outer parts of its wings which are highly visible in flight and for which it is named. The females are slightly duller than the males but overall the two are very similar. Immature birds are much duller than the adults and do not have the blue colouring on their throats. They also have brown bills and feet instead of the red of the adults.\n\nThe oriental dollarbird is found from Australia to Japan and India. It breeds in northern and eastern Australia between the months of September and April and winters in New Guinea and nearby islands. The birds prefer open wooded areas with hollow-bearing trees to build nests in.\n\nThe oriental dollarbird is most commonly seen singly with a distinctive upright silhouette on a bare branch high in a tree, from which it hawks for insects, returning to the same perch after a few seconds.\n\n"}
{"id": "2075820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075820", "title": "Idlewild (film)", "text": "Idlewild (film)\n\nIdlewild is a 2006 American musical film written and directed by Bryan Barber. The film stars André 3000 and Big Boi of the hip hop duo Outkast, and \"Idlewild\" features musical numbers written, produced and chiefly performed by Outkast. \"Idlewild\" contrasts the group's hip-hop/funk/soul sound against a story based on a juke joint in the fictional Depression-era town of Idlewild, Georgia in 1935.\n\nDistributed by Universal Pictures, the film is an HBO Films co-production alongside Mosaic Media Group and Forensic Films. The film features an ensemble cast including Terrence Howard, Paula Jai Parker, Paula Patton, Cicely Tyson, Ben Vereen, Patti LaBelle, Ving Rhames, Macy Gray, Faizon Love, Bruce Bruce, Malinda Williams, Jackie Long and Bill Nunn.\n\n\"Idlewild\" received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $12 million worldwide. It was nominated for six Black Reel Awards.\n\nPercival (Andre 3000) and Rooster (Big Boi) have been good friends since childhood. However, as they grow up, they each begin to live separate lives. In 1935, Percival works at his father Percy Senior's (Vereen) morgue during the day, and works at a local club called Church at night playing the piano. Rooster becomes a singer at the club and a bootlegger; he also marries Zora (Williams), with whom he has five children.\n\nOne night when Rooster shows up late to the club, everyone becomes upset and rowdy including gangsters Spats (Rhames), Trumpy (Howard), Ace (Love) and Rose (Paula Jai Parker) who have a business deal with the club and Rooster. Finally Rooster shows up and performs; Rooster, Spats, Trumpy and Ace talk about their deal. Spats wishes to get out of the business, and is willing to sell out to Ace. Meanwhile, backstage, a singer from St. Louis named Angel Davenport (Paula Patton) comes into the club and starts to complain about her train ride and her contract with the club. Angel is actually an imposter; she is really an aspiring singer named Sally B. Shelley, who stole the contract from the real Davenport (Labelle).\n\nRooster and Rose have sex in a car in a warehouse until they hear people coming into the warehouse, Rose jumps out of the car, gets dressed and confronts Spats, Trumpy and Ace who have just arrived. Rose then runs off, Trumpy then shoots and kills Spats and Ace in order to get the business for himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Rooster runs into Trumpy while taking his family shopping and Trumpy explains that the debt owed by Ace is now his problem. He has to come up with this money by selling liquor at Church bought from Trumpy's \"suppliers\". Rooster goes to Rose's house to warn her, but she is already packed up and ready to leave. As Rose drives away in a taxi, she is being watched by one of Trumpy's henchmen.\n\nMeanwhile, Rooster begins to have more problems at the club, and forces Angel to sing. Angel has an attack of stage fright, but Percival calms her by giving her a song that he wrote for her. The song is a hit, and Angel becomes an overnight star; she and Percival also fall in love. During a storm, Angel runs over to the morgue to be with Percival, and the two have sex.\n\nRoosters's wife Zora gets tired of his cheating and moves with their children to her mother's house. Angel gets a record deal in Chicago and asks Percival to go with her, but he reluctantly declines, as he feels obligated to his father. When Angel finds out that Percival knows who she really is, however, she pledges her love to him and persuades him to go to Chicago with her.\n\nRooster devises a plan to buy liquor from bootlegger GW (Nunn) and his partner. One day, Rooster is making his rounds to pick up hooch from GW to load in a hearse borrowed from Percival, when he sees a car on the road that seems to be stuck. He approaches the car to see an old woman, Mother Hopkins (Tyson), and her grandchildren. Mother Hopkins tells Rooster that he is an angel and gives him a bible. Rooster walks into the old abandoned house of the two bootleggers and sees that Trumpy's henchmen have beaten up GW and killed his partner.\n\nRooster is caught and brought to Trumpy, and GW is shot and killed. There is a fight between Rooster and Trumpy's henchmen. Rooster is shot but not killed due to the bible in his jacket and drives away in the hearse. However, Trumpy pursues him and shoots at him. Rooster escapes into the Church club, and soon after Trumpy arrives at the club. Before going to Chicago, Angel and Percival decide to make a stop at the Church club, Rooster and Trumpy have a dramatic fight in the club and shots are fired by Trumpy. Everyone in the club panics, and just when Trumpy is about to shoot Rooster, Trumpy is shot and killed by Percival.\n\nPercival then notices that Angel has been shot and runs to her aid. However Angel dies soon afterward and Percival begins to grieve. He then tends to her and prepares her for burial, dressing her up in a wedding gown and slipping a ring on her finger, implying that he was planning on marrying her. Afterward, Percival attempts to commit suicide by hanging himself in his room, but is interrupted when Rooster rings the doorbell. Percival is consoled and gives Angel's Chicago bound ticket to Rooster, who is then reunited with his wife and children. Percival then begins to make records and tour in clubs throughout America and becomes famous. The film ends with pictures of Percival, and Angel in her coffin hung next to a picture of Percival's mother in her coffin at Percival's house.\n\n\nThe musical numbers in them are songs written and performed by OutKast, with other featured performances by Macy Gray and Paula Patton (dubbed by Debra Killings) The hip hop, funk, and soul stylings of the song score are intentionally anachronistic, given the fact that the film is set in 1935. Elements of 1930s-era blues and jazz music are however featured prominently in many of the musical numbers. The film's dance numbers, choreographed by Hinton Battle, also feature many period dances, primarily the jitterbug.\n\nMost of the songs in \"Idlewild\" had already been featured on the OutKast albums \"Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast\" and \"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\", essentially making \"Idlewild\" a jukebox musical. Seven of the songs from the film, along with several unreleased songs, were released by LaFace Records as an OutKast album entitled \"Idlewild\" at the time of the film's release.\n\nThe film received mixed response, with a Rotten Tomatoes aggregate of 48% fresh. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" said, \"Idlewild can't decide if it's about bullets, booze, broads or the sound of hip-hop that the film strenuously tries to marry to the 1930s\". \"Seemingly meant as an African-American \"Moulin Rouge\",\" wrote Frank Lovece of \"Film Journal International\", \"this visual blast of an homage to classic Hollywood musicals settles in as an odd hybrid, neither fish nor fowl. Nor foul, either, though not great — and ultimately, more idle than wild\". Teresa Wiltz of \"The Washington Post\" likewise acknowledged director Bryan Barber's inventiveness, saying that, \"For all its shortcomings, \"Idlewild\" also has something that few films can pull off: Moments of such pure cinematic fabulousness, breathtaking dance sequences and idiosyncratic flourishes that we are more than willing to forgive it for all its sins\".\n\nThe film grossed $12,571,185 on a $10 million budget.\n\n\n\n"}

Cunningham in command.\n\nShe departed Hampton Roads on 25 June 1845 as flagship of Commodore Charles W. Skinner in command of United States naval vessels operating off the western coast of Africa to suppress the slave trade. At the end of her first deployment the sloop arrived at Boston, Massachusetts on 6 August 1846.\n\nWhile she was moored at the Boston Navy Yard word reached the United States that for the second consecutive year blight had ruined the potato crop of Ireland, depriving the people of that country of their chief means of subsistence. A joint resolution of Congress approved 3 March 1847 authorized the Secretary of the Navy to place \"Jamestown\" and at the disposal of Captains Robert Bennet Forbes and George Coleman De Kay to carry food to the starving poor of Ireland. \"Jamestown\" sailed from Boston on 28 March and arrived at Cork, Ireland on 12 April. After unloading her life-saving cargo, the sloop returned to Boston on 17 May.\n\nAs flagship of Commodore William Compton Bolton, \"Jamestown\" again stood out of Boston on 22 July to operate on the west coast of Africa. A year later she was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron to assist in protecting American citizens and interests during the epidemic of revolutions which convulsed Europe in 1848. After political conditions became more stable, \"Jamestown\" returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 4 May 1850.\n\nAfter a year at home, she was assigned to the Brazil Squadron departing Norfolk on 1 June 1851 to begin operations off South America lasting until her return to Philadelphia Navy Yard on 2 May 1854.

She re-commissioned on 16 December and cruised the West Indies with the Home Squadron until decommissioning at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 14 February 1860.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Civil War, \"Jamestown\" re-commissioned on 5 June 1861 and was assigned to the Atlantic Blockading Squadron, where she compiled a record of outstanding efficiency. The sloop chased the bark \"Alvarado\" ashore off Fernandina, Florida and set her on fire on 5 August, and captured the schooner \"Aigburth\" off the coast of Florida on 31 August 1861. Four days later she captured, dismantled, and scuttled the schooner \"Colonel Long\". Next she captured the schooner \"Havelock\" on 15 December. Her final prize was the brig \"Intended\", taken off Wilmington, North Carolina on 1 May 1862.\n\n\"Jamestown\" departed for the Pacific on 12 October to protect American commerce from Confederate privateers; and she remained on that duty until after the end of the war, decommissioning at Mare Island on 17 September 1865.\n\nHaving been converted to a transport and store ship, she recommissioned on 3 September 1866 to serve at Panama as a store and hospital ship. Because of fever on board, \"Jamestown\" was ordered north on 2 April 1867 and was disinfected at San Francisco, California. Joining the North Pacific Squadron, she served as guard and storeship at Sitka, Alaska, from 11 September 1867 until 30 May 1868. \"Jamestown\" was present at the hoisting of the U.S. Flag at Sitka on 18 October 1867 after Alaska was purchased from Russia.\n\n\"Jamestown\" arrived at Mare Island on 23 July 1868; decommissioned there on 13 August; and recommissioned on 25 January 1869, following repairs. For almost three years, \"Jamestown\" cruised the Pacific on the west coasts of North and South America, and as far west as Tahiti and the Fiji and Hawaiian Islands.\n\nDecommissioning on 7 October 1871, \"Jamestown\" was placed in ordinary at Mare Island until 16 March 1876 when she recommissioned for use as a State Public Marine School. She operated at the Hawaiian Islands in this capacity until she was returned to the Navy Department and decommissioned on 3 March 1879.\n\nShe was recommissioned on 8 May and sailed for Sitka, Alaska, where she surveyed the harbor and protected American interests. In 1881, she sailed the Pacific until decommissioning at San Francisco on 21 September.\n\nHaving been fitted out as an apprentice training ship, \"Jamestown\" recommissioned on 14 February 1882 and proceeded to the Atlantic coast via Cape Horn. In her new capacity, she sailed the Atlantic Ocean, voyaging to the West Indies, Spain, and as far north as the State of Maine. While at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 20 December 1883, Landsman J. W. Norris and Ordinary Seaman Robert Augustus Sweeney jumped overboard and rescued a man from drowning, for which they were each awarded the Medal of Honor. On 31 August 1888, \"Jamestown\" decommissioned at Norfolk.\n\nRecommissioning 13 April 1889, \"Jamestown\" cruised to France and to the West Indies with apprentices, and decommissioned again on 6 September 1892 at Norfolk.\n\nOn 9 September she was transferred to the Treasury Department for Marine Hospital Service for quarantine purposes in Hampton Roads.
