{"id": "2268810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268810", "title": "Destrier", "text": "Destrier\n\nThe destrier is the best-known war horse of the medieval era. It carried knights in battles, tournaments, and jousts. It was described by contemporary sources as the \"Great Horse\", due to its significance.\n\nWhile highly prized by knights and men-at-arms, the destrier was not very common. Most knights and mounted men-at-arms rode other war horses, such as coursers and rounceys. These three types of horse were often referred to generically as chargers.\n\nThe word is first attested in Middle English around 1330, as \"destrer\". It was borrowed into Middle English from Anglo-Norman \"destrer\", whose Old French counterpart was \"destrier\" (from which the Modern English spelling derives). The word is also found in medieval Provençal (as \"destrier\") and Italian (as \"destriere\", \"destriero\"). These forms themselves derived from the Vulgar Latin \"equus dextarius\", meaning \"right-sided horse\" (from \"dextra\", \"right hand\", the same root as \"dextrous\" and \"dexterity\"). This may refer to it being led by the squire at the knight's right side (or led by the right hand) or to the horse's gait, (possibly leading with the right).\n\nThe word \"destrier\" does not refer to a breed, but to a \"type\" of horse: the finest and strongest warhorse. These horses were usually stallions, bred and raised from foalhood specifically for the needs of war. The destrier was also considered the most suited to the joust; coursers seem to have been preferred for other forms of warfare. They had powerful hindquarters, able to easily coil and spring to stop, spin, turn or sprint forward. They also had a short back and well-muscled loin, strong bone, and a well-arched neck. From medieval art, the head of the destrier appears to have had a straight or slightly convex profile, strong, wide jaw, and good width between the eyes.\n\nThe destrier was specifically for use in battle or tournament; for everyday riding, a knight would use a palfrey, and his baggage would be carried on a sumpter horse (or packhorse), or possibly in wagons.\n\nScholars have speculated about the nature of destriers and about the size they attained. They apparently were not enormous draft types. Recent research undertaken at the Museum of London, using literary, pictorial and archeological sources, suggests war horses (including destriers) averaged from , and differed from a riding horse in their strength, musculature and training, rather than in their size. An analysis of medieval horse armour located in the Royal Armouries indicates the equipment was originally worn by horses of , about the size and build of a modern field hunter or ordinary riding horse.\n\nThe modern Percheron draft breed may in part descend from destriers, though it is probably taller and heavier than the average destrier. Other draft breeds such as the Shire claim destrier ancestry, though proof is less certain.\n\nEquestrian statues in Italy suggest a \"Spanish\" style of horse that today would be referred to as a Baroque horse, such as the Andalusian horse, Friesian horse, or even a heavy but agile warmblood breed such as the Irish Draught. Modern estimates put the height of a destrier at no more than , but with a strong and heavy physique. Though the term \"Great Horse\" was used to describe the destrier, leading some historians to speculate that such animals were the forerunners of modern draught horse breeds, the historical record does not support the image of the destrier as a draft horse.\n\nModern attempts to reproduce the destrier type usually involve crossing an athletic riding horse with a light draft type. Outcomes of such attempts include crossbreds such as the \"Spanish-Norman\", a cross between the Percheron and the Andalusian; and the Warlander, a cross between the Andalusian and the Friesian horse.\n\nA good destrier was expensive. Seventh-century Salic law gives a price of 12 solidi as weregild, or reparational payment, for a war horse, compared to 3 solidi for a sound mare or 1 solidus for a cow. In later centuries destriers became even more expensive: the average value of each of the horses in a company of 22 knights and squires in the county of Flanders in 1297 compares to the price of seven normal coursers. The price of these destriers varied between 20 and 300 livres parisis (parisian pounds), compared to 5 to 12 livres for a normal courser.\n\n"}
{"id": "2268811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268811", "title": "Puerto Rican amazon", "text": "Puerto Rican amazon\n\nThe Puerto Rican amazon (\"Amazona vittata\"), also known as the Puerto Rican parrot or iguaca, is the only extant parrot endemic to the archipelago of Puerto Rico, and belongs to the Neotropical genus \"Amazona\". Measuring , the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form \"gracilipes\" from Culebra Island, extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the Cuban amazon and the Hispaniolan amazon.\n\nThe Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual maturity at between three and four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays eggs she will remain in the nest and continuously incubate them until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy.\n\nThe species is the only remaining native parrot in Puerto Rico and has been listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union since 1994. Once widespread and abundant, the population declined drastically in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the removal of most of its native habitat; the species completely vanished from Vieques and Mona Island, nearby to the main island of Puerto Rico. Conservation efforts commenced in 1968 to save the bird from extinction. In 2012, the total estimated population was 58–80 individuals in the wild and over 300 individuals in captivity.\n\nThe Puerto Rican amazon was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his \"Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux\". The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the \"Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle\" which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name \"Psittacus vittatus\" in his catalogue of the \"Planches Enluminées\". Buffon mistaken believed that his specimen had been collected in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti), rather than in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican amazon is now placed in the large Neotropical genus \"Amazona \" that was introduced by the French naturalist René Lesson in 1830. The specific epithet \"vittatus\" is Latin for \"banded\".\n\nBirds in the genus \"Amazona\" are commonly known as amazons. They have also been given the generic epithet of \"parrot\" by the American Ornithologists' Union, and hence \"Puerto Rican parrot\" is an alternative common name in North America. The indigenous Taíno people called it the \"iguaca\", an onomatopoeic name that resembled the parrots' flight call.\n\nThere are two recognized subspecies:\n\nThere is no evidence that the West Indies were connected to a continent in the past, and thus the various native bird species are assumed to be descended from those that immigrated to the Caribbean at some point. Some small species would have encountered problems traversing large bodies of water, but parrots have flight strength and various behavioral characteristics that would facilitate \"over-water\" dispersion. Most Caribbean bird species originate from Central, North and South America. The \"Amazona\" species found in the Caribbean are divided in two groups: five mid-sized species found in the Greater Antilles and seven large species in the Lesser Antilles. All the Greater Antillean amazons display characteristics leading to suppositions of relatedness, including predominantly green-toned color patterns and white rings around the eyes. Russello and Amato conclude that all Greater Antillean \"Amazona\" descend from \"Amazona albifrons\" with \"Amazona vittata\", \"Amazona leucocephala\", and \"Amazona ventralis\" constituting a complex, a cluster of species so closely related that they intergrade.\n\nBritish ornithologist David Lack considered that the Puerto Rican amazon had evolved from the Hispaniolan amazon (\"A. ventralis\") found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (\"A. agilis\") of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within members of the same species. The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican \"A. agilis\". Recent phylogenetic studies show that the Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black-billed amazon.\n\nThe Puerto Rican amazon measures and weighs , or on average. Although small compared to amazons in general, it is similar in size to other Greater Antilles \"Amazona\" species. Sexual dimorphism is not present. Both males and females have predominantly green plumage, though their feathers have blue edges. The primary flight feathers of the wings and the main covert feathers are dark blue. The color of the feathers on the underside varies depending on the body part: the feathers on the underside of the wings, which can be seen during flight, are bright blue; those in the tail have yellow-green tone. Their underparts are paler and yellow-tinged, their foreheads are red, and they have white ovals around the eyes. The iris is brown, the bill a horn color, and the legs yellow-tan. Aside from DNA tests, males and females can only be distinguished by behavioral differences during the breeding season. Immature birds have plumage similar to adults.\nThe precise distribution of the Puerto Rican amazon before the arrival of Spanish colonialists is uncertain, because of a lack of contemporary records and then the extermination of the indigenous Taíno people, but the species was apparently widespread and abundant. There is also evidence the species may have inhabited other nearby islands, such as Antigua, Barbuda and the Virgin Islands. Estimates of the parrot's early numbers vary greatly. Some authorities claim that there were once more than a million individuals, while others suggest a more modest population of 100,000. During the first 150 years of Spanish rule the human population was small, and in 1650, when the population of the island was 880 people, the species was still abundant throughout the archipelago. After 1650, human habitation increased exponentially, and by the 18th century the Puerto Rican amazon population started to be affected. Heinrich Moritz Gaede, a German naturalist, declared that by 1836 the parrot population had noticeably declined. Even so, as late as 1864, British ornithologist Edward Cavendish Taylor noted that the parrots were still common near the island's capital, San Juan.\n\nAt first, human activity had not posed a significant threat to the Puerto Rican amazon. The Taíno hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population. In the past 200 years, however, many factors have led to a drastic decrease in the birds' numbers: agricultural development, the construction of roads, hydroelectric development, and the adoption of young chicks as pets. Especially during the latter half of the 19th century, most of Puerto Rico's virgin forests, a historical habitat of the species, were cleared for agricultural development, primarily for the production of sugar, cotton, corn and rice. The amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest; local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if possible. As agriculture expanded, the amazon's habitat disappeared further and its population declined.\n\nThe species was historically found in mature or old-growth forests in Puerto Rico at all elevations, and in holes, cliffs, and other diverse habitats at lower elevations. The species could be found at medium elevations in the Guajataca State Forest (until 1910) and the Rio Abajo State Forest (until the 1920s), and at high elevations in the Carite State Forest (until the 1930s). Accounts from the early 1900s describe the parrots traveling away from the Luquillo forest and the Sierra de Cayey towards the main island's coast to find food. The species was extirpated from Culebra by the early 20th century. A karst-limestone region in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico was identified as a haven for the species. In particular, a region named \"Valle de las Cotorras\" (Valley of the Parrots), located between San Sebastián and Morovis, was home to a sizable population. Eventually their natural habitat was reduced to the Cordillera Central. By 1960 they were only to be found in primary forest at the Luquillo Mountains in El Yunque National Forest. The species is currently found at elevations between . Since the species requires mature forests with open-cavity trees for reproduction, it does not occur in dwarf and secondary forests.\n\nBy the 1950s, there were only 200 parrots in the wild, and in 1975 the population reached an absolute low of 13 individuals. Numbers then recovered, and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals. But on September 18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds. In the aftermath of the hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals. In 2004, the wild population was 30–35 individuals, and the long-term trend appears to be stable albeit with some fluctuations. The current range of the species is , 0.2% of what it once was.\n\nThe Puerto Rican amazon is diurnal, typically beginning its day half an hour after sunrise. It is generally secretive when inside its nest, using its green plumage as camouflage. In contrast, it may be vocal and noisy when outside the nest. Upon taking flight, its color pattern provides some contrast to the forest. The flight mechanism of this species is similar to the one found in other amazons, and involves strokes below the body axis, unlike most birds whose wings flow above their bodies in flight. Amazons can fly moderately fast, reaching a top speed of approximately , and are fairly agile when evading predators in mid-air. When in search of food, the parrots group in pairs. Couples and their fledged young display a tendency to stay together. The amazon makes two flight calls, a take-off squawk which consist of a pattern of long squawks, and a loud \"bugle\", commonly used in flight and which may have several meanings depending on the circumstances when it is used.\n\nLike almost all amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is a herbivore. Its diet consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest's canopy. The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger range. Among the items it consumes are the pericarp of the seeds of sierra palm (\"Prestoea montana\"), tabonuco (\"Dacryodes excelsa\"), and negra lora (\"Matayba domingensis\"); the fruits of \"bejuco de rana\" (\"Marcgravia sintenisii\"), camasey (\"Miconia sintenisii\"), cupey de altura (\"Clusia gundlachii\"), and \"palo de cruz\" (\"Rheedia portoricensis\"); the flowers of bejuco de rana, achiotillo (\"Alchornea latifolia\"), and \"Piptocarpha tetrantha\"; the leaves and twigs of cupeillo (\"Clusia grisebachiana\"), laurel sabino (\"Magnolia splendens\"), caimitillo verde (\"Micropholis garciniaefolia\"), and \"Piptocarpha tetrantha\"; the bark of bejuco de rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun (\"Psychotria berteriana\"); and the buds of cuaba (\"Inga vera\"). It normally selects the fruits positioned directly in front of its eyes, picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions. When feeding, it uses a foot to pick up the food. The amazon feeds in a slow, paused manner taking 8–60 seconds to consume separate items.\n\nThe Puerto Rican amazon usually mates for life, with pairs only changing mates if one bird perishes or abandons the nest. A male may abandon the female if the latter is injured, re-mating with a more \"physically perfect\" subject. The pairing process is unknown; however, new pairs tend to participate in mutual mating dances characterised by coordinated bows, partial extension of the wings and full tail expansion.\n\nThe Puerto Rican amazon is a secondary cavity nester, nesting in tree trunk cavities, both naturally occurring and excavated by other species. It prefers to nest in \"Palo colorado\" trees (\"Cyrilla racemiflora\"), but uses other trees, including the laurel sabino (\"Magnolia splendens\") and tabonuco (\"Dacryodes excelsa\"), to a lesser extent. These trees are mature cavity-forming trees which provide protection against predators and the entry of water. Recently, the species has also nested in artificial wooden boxes designed as part of the recovery plan for the species. Nest height varies from above ground. The male usually leads the search for nest sites, although the final decision seems to be taken by the female. Once a site is selected, the pair will spend some time inspecting and cleaning it. No lining material is added to the nest.\nThe Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual maturity at 4 years of age in the wild and at 3 years in captivity. The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July (the dry season). Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers, with this possibly serving as a trigger for intercourse. Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas, with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female's back. As the time for egg-laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest, with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation. The female lays 2–4 eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days, while the male will be present in the vicinity of the nest when providing food. Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame. The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest, usually 60 to 65 days after they hatch. Nonetheless, they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season.\n\nLike other amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is gregarious while performing daily activities, but territorial around its nest. The size of the territory around the nest is usually around . Pairs are extremely cautious near their nest, usually moving in a slow manner when leaving the nest to avoid the attention of predators. Although territorial defense is mostly composed of loud vocalizations there are instances of actual physical combat. Pairs will defend their nest sites against invading couples, sometimes focusing on the location's defense instead of egg-laying. Pairs nesting in areas uninhabited by other parrots will remain mostly silent unless other parrots enter the zone. Some pairs may display moderate territoriality even when not apparently intending to nest, with these tendencies beginning in the latter half of the breeding season. One hypothesis is that this would occur in young pairs that had still not reached full maturity, serving as \"practice territoriality\".\n\nOn March 11, 1967, the Puerto Rican amazon entered the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species. At the time of inclusion the population was estimated at 70 individuals. In 1968, recovery efforts began to increase the population in the wild. In 1972, when the estimated population was 16 individuals, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) at the Luquillo Aviary began efforts to breed parrots in captivity and yielded good results. In June 2006, it was reported by the USFWS that its birds in captivity had successfully hatched 39 chicks (the yearly average is around 16). In 2006, 22 birds were released in the Rio Abajo State Forest to initiate a second wild population, and a further 19 were released at the same site on 27 December 2008.\n\nThe World Conservation Union (IUCN) lists the Puerto Rican amazon as a critically endangered species since 1994. The species is regulated under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts.\n\nHuman activity is arguably the main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is the main reason for the decline of population.\n\nNatural predators of the Puerto Rican amazon include the red-tailed hawk (\"Buteo jamaicensis\"), the broad-winged hawk (\"Buteo platypterus\"), the peregrine falcon (\"Falco peregrinus\") and the pearly-eyed thrasher (\"Margarops fuscatus\"). The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century and has been a problem for the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, specially designed deep nests were prepared for the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders. Introduced honeybees (\"Apis mellifera\"), the related Hispaniolan amazon (\"Amazona ventralis\"), black rats (\"Rattus rattus\") and Indian mongooses (\"Herpestes javanicus\") may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.\n\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, were not a threat to the Puerto Rican parrot population when it was more readily self-maintaining, but as a result of the fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a threat as well. Hurricane Hugo passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.\n\nIn response to the Puerto Rican amazon's low population and endangered status, a recovery plan was drafted and implemented in 1968. Its main objective was to downlist the species to threatened status by the year 2020. Other objectives included establishing two separate viable wild populations (each of which would consist of 500 or more individuals for a period of at least five years), protecting habitat for those populations, and controlling predators, parasites and competitors. A third site was planned in 2011 by the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex. As part of the conservation efforts, a captive population was established in the Luquillo Aviary in 1973. Another was established in 1993 when some individuals were transferred from the Luquillo Aviary to the Rio Abajo State Forest under the administration of the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources (\"Departamento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales\"). In 2007, expanded facilities at the Iguaca Aviary at the El Yunque National Forest were inaugurated and dedicated to the late Priscilla Stubbe, who was a major fundraiser for the new facility.\n\nHuman activity once again threatened the amazon during the following years. In 2012, it was reported that the unsanctioned flight of light aircraft from adjacent islands was disrupting the reproductive and social behaviors of the species. \"Via Verde\", a gas pipeline grid proposed by the Luis Fortuño administration, raised concerns among conservationists due to further deforestation of the regions where the birds feed. New conservation efforts have also begun during this timeframe. In 2011, a research team of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez sequenced the amazon's genome. On August 15, 2013, the discovery of non-assisted nests in the Río Abajo State Forest was announced. Experts considered this a sign of expansion, implying that the reintroduced amazon population was fully adapting to wild life and was dispersing throughout the region. This was noted as a significant advance, since El Yunque is not an ideal habitat for the bird due to its humidity, which precipitates sickness in some of the individuals. This was accompanied by a second announcement, which noted that added to the known number of amazons in the wild (fluctuating between 64 and 112 specimens) there is an unmonitored population of approximately 50 birds dispersed throughout Puerto Rico.\n\nThe creation of another aviary and captive reproduction center was considered throughout 2013, with the municipalities of Maricao and Isabela being analyzed. In November 2013, plans for the establishment of a third population in the Maricao State Forest were formally announced. The following month, ten amazons were released at Río Abajo. 2013 set a new record for the reproduction program, which produced 51 fledglings and shattered the previous record of 34 that was established in 2011. The wild population grew by 15 chicks, an improvement from the 12 born during the previous year. During this time frame, the known number of amazon specimens rounded 500 individuals. A severe drought caused by the emergence of El Niño began during the spring of 2015 and extended throughout the summer, benefitting the breeding of the amazons in El Yunque by extending their reproductive season. However, this weather pattern also increased the number of mongooses present in the forest, representing a risk for the population. On August 13, 2015, a group of 25 amazons was moved from the other aviaries to a repurposed installation in Maricao. Each member was brought individually in order to ensure their safety while being transported and later placed in an acclimation program that is expected to last a year, before they are released to create a new population in the region.\n\nTo assist in improving the understanding of the overall population health of this species and aid in captive breeding programs the genome was sequenced by researchers at University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez. As an emblematic species of Puerto Rico, this was carried out as a uniquely community-funded project. The research budget raised by student organized art and fashion shows dedicated to the effort plus small personal donations from Puerto Rican citizens who wanted to support the work. And from this data producing microsatellite marker sets to aid the captive breeding efforts and population monitoring studies by providing unique identifiers for individual birds. In early 2020, 30 parrots were released into the El Yunque rainforest.\n\n\n"}

It is native to northwestern Africa in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, with two small outlying populations on Malta, and near Cartagena in southeast Spain. It grows at relatively low altitudes in a hot, dry subtropical Mediterranean climate.\n\nIts closest relatives are \"Platycladus, Microbiota\", and \"Calocedrus\", with the closest resemblance to the latter. In older texts, it was sometimes treated in \"Thuja\" or \"Callitris\", but it is less closely related to those genera.\n\nIt is a small, slow-growing tree, to 6–15 m (rarely 20 m) tall and 0.5 m (rarely 1 m) trunk diameter, often with two or more trunks from the base. The foliage forms in open sprays with scale-like leaves 1–8 mm long and 1–1.5 mm broad; the leaves are arranged in opposite decussate pairs, with the successive pairs closely then distantly spaced, so forming apparent whorls of four. The cones are 10–15 mm long, green ripening brown in about 8 months from pollination, and have four thick scales arranged in two opposite pairs. The seeds are 5–7 mm long and 2 mm broad, with a 3–4 mm broad papery wing on each side.\n\nIt is one of only a small number of conifers able to coppice (regrow by sprouting from stumps), an adaptation to survive wildfire and moderate levels of browsing by animals. Old trees that have sprouted repeatedly over a long period form large burls at the base, known as \"lupias\".\n\nIt is the national tree of Malta, where it is known as \"għargħar\" (derived from the Arabic ). It is now being used locally in afforestation projects.\n\nThe resin, known as sandarac, is used to make varnish and lacquer; it is particularly valued for preserving paintings.\n\nThe wood, known as thuya wood, citron wood, and alerce, and historically also known as thyine wood, is used for decorative woodwork, particularly wood from burls at the base of the trunk. The market in Morocco is unsustainable, focusing as it does on the burl, and has resulted in mass deforestation of the species. The species is also threatened by overgrazing, which can kill the coppice regrowth before it gets tall enough to be out of the reach of livestock.\n\nThe species is cultivated to be grown as an ornamental tree, valued in hot, dry climates. It is also pruned in a hedge form, for privacy and security. The plant can be trained for use as bonsai specimens.\n\n†Tetraclinis salicornioides leaf and cone fossils of Messinian age (ca. 5.7 Ma) have been uncovered in Monte Tondo and Borgo Tossignano, northern Apennines, Italy.\n"}
{"id": "2268823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268823", "title": "Sandarac", "text": "Sandarac\n\nSandarac (or sandarach) is a resin obtained from the small cypress-like tree \"Tetraclinis articulata\". The tree is native to the northwest of Africa with a notable presence in the Southern Morocco part of the Atlas mountains. The resin exudes naturally on the stems of the tree. It is also obtained by making cuts on the bark. It solidifies when exposed to the air. It comes to commerce in the form of small solid chips, translucent, and having a delicate yellow tinge. Morocco has been the main place of origin of sandarac. A similar resin is obtained in southern Australia from some species of the Australian cypress-like trees \"Callitris\", but the resin has not been systematically collected in Australia.\n\nHistorically, especially in the Late Medieval and Renaissance era, sandarac was used to make varnish. When \"varnish\" was spoken of in Renaissance Italy (Italian \"vernice\") it usually meant sandarac. Copal and other resins displaced it as equally good, less expensive varnishing materials. Nevertheless the sandarac varnish is still valued today for use as a protective coating on paintings and antiques. It gives a coat which is hard, lustrous and durable. The varnish is made by melting the resin and mixing it with (e.g.) linseed oil. Sandarac resin melts at about 150°C to a colourless or slightly yellow liquid. Its specific gravity is about 1.04.\n\nIn mid-to-late 19th century photography, a varnish was applied as a preservative to photographic negatives and positives. Sandarac resin was preferred by some photographers for this purpose. \nAlthough it is not very strongly aromatic, sandarac resin was and is also used as an incense. The aroma has been compared to balsam.\n\nBesides the resin and the varnish, the word sandarac may refer to the tree that produces the resin. Entirely separately from that, the ancient Greeks and Romans used the word \"sandarac\" to refer to arsenic sulfide particularly red arsenic sulfide. In medieval Latin the term \"sandaraca\" meant red lead as well as red arsenic sulfide. The word's resin/varnish meaning came to Europe from Arabic in the early 16th century.

The business was started by Doug Williamson and Gary Buckland, 24 year old entrepreneurs and local business graduates. Doug Williamson was an accomplished television and film actor at the time, appearing in several films and starring in numerous television shows, and he credits the early success of Esquires to running the coffee house like a theatre production, casting the cafe with an ensemble whose primary purpose was to deliver a special experience to Esquires' guests. As he puts it, “We had a really cool culture because we didn’t know any better; we didn’t behave like we were running a business. We were giving a performance and hoping people enjoyed themselves. Coffee was the conduit, mostly.\"\n\nIn 1994 Doug and Gary on-boarded Peter E. Wudy, one of Canada's leading franchise consultants, to assist with expansion. With Peter's help and guidance, the chain expanded rapidly and 37 branches were opened across Canada, primarily on the west coast of British Columbia, before the company went international on a franchise basis.\n\nEsquires expanded to the United Kingdom in 2000, followed by Ireland in 2001. Peter Kirton purchased the master license rights for Esquires Coffee U.K. Limited, which he held until purchased by Cooks Global Foods in 2013. Tony McVerry purchased the master license rights for Esquires Coffee Ireland, which he held until purchased by Cooks Global Foods in 2013.\n\nIn 2002, brothers Stuart and Lewis Deeks established the Esquires brand in Australasia through a master franchise agreement with the Canadian parent. Under the name Franchise Development Ltd, they grew the business to become the leading branded chain in New Zealand by store numbers.\n\nIn 2011, the Deeks sold the Australia and New Zealand franchise rights to Retail Food Group while retaining the rights to the Middle East, China and a number of other jurisdictions.\n\nIn 2013, the Deeks merged their business into NZX-listed Cooks Global Foods. In April 2013, Cooks acquired the intellectual property and master franchising rights to Esquires Coffee Houses worldwide - excluding New Zealand and Australia. The company also owns wholesale businesses in related industries. Cooks immediately hired Doug Williamson, one of the original founders, to re-join the organisation and run the United Kingdom business. Under Doug's leadership, Esquires Coffee U.K. rebranded their 23 store estate, re-modelled the business and re-introduced Esquires Coffee as a franchise investment opportunity. As of 2019, Esquires have expanded from 23 stores to 53 stores, with regional development commitments which will see the chain expand to 125 U.K. stores by 2028.\n\nToday there are more than 40 Esquires stores in Australia and New Zealand operated by Retail Food Group including two drive-thru outlets.\n\nIn April 2014, Cooks Global Foods acquired the Esquires Canadian intellectual property rights, the original Esquires franchisor founded in 1993.\n\nGlobally Cooks Global Foods owns the Esquires Coffee Houses brand and system in Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland, where it also directly franchises stores, and the Middle East and China where stores are franchised through master franchise holders.\n\nIn October 2013, the parent company presented its plans to consolidate and grow the business, with a minimum objective of 580 Esquires stores globally by 2020.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, Esquires owns the master franchises covering 38 stores and a refurbishment programme is underway to ensure that the branding is aligned with the global design and to upgrade stores and to ensure that service consistency is enhanced.\n\nIn the Middle East, the company has commitments for the development of more than 80 Esquires Coffee Houses in the world's most influential Arab economic alliance. Master Franchisees currently operate stores in all Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and the UAE. Oman and Qatar have recently signed master franchise agreements and will have stores operating during 2014.\n\nIn China, Esquires is currently looking for investors who may be experienced franchisees, experienced hospitality retailers, investors - wanting to open territories and commit to opening a specific number of stores.\n\nIn North America, Esquires now licenses back to Esquires Canada the right to use the IP to the existing 14 Esquires Coffee Houses stores in British Columbia and for a Master Franchise Agreement for Alberta. Esquires plans to focus on aggressive growth nationwide which will include the construction of a number of new corporate flagships this year and expansion into other Canadian provinces.\n\nIn 2018 Esquires Coffee Open its first store in Pakistan and Jordan.\n\n"}

{"id": "2268863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268863", "title": "Canine transmissible venereal tumor", "text": "Canine transmissible venereal tumor\n\nCanine transmissible venereal tumors (CTVTs), also called transmissible venereal tumors (TVTs), canine transmissible venereal sarcoma (CTVS), sticker tumors and infectious sarcoma is a histiocytic tumor of the external genitalia of the dog and other canines, and is transmitted from animal to animal during mating. It is one of only three known transmissible cancers in mammals; the others are devil facial tumor disease, a cancer which occurs in Tasmanian devils, and contagious reticulum cell sarcoma of the Syrian hamster.\n\nThe tumor cells are themselves the infectious agents, and the tumors that form are not genetically related to the host dog. Although the genome of a CTVT is derived from a canid (probably a dog, wolf or coyote), it is now essentially living as a unicellular, asexually reproducing (but sexually transmitted) pathogen. Sequence analysis of the genome suggests it diverged from canids over 6,000 years ago; possibly much earlier. The most recent estimates of its time of origin date it to about 11,000 years ago. However, the most recent common ancestor of \"extant\" tumors is more recent: it probably originated 200 to 2,500 years ago. The source has more recently been placed in a population of sled dogs with coyote contribution.\n\nCanine TVTs were initially described by Russian veterinarian M.A. Novinsky (1841–1914) in 1876, when he demonstrated that the tumor could be transplanted from one dog to another by infecting them with tumor cells.\n\nCanine transmissible venereal tumors are histiocytic tumors that may be transmitted among dogs through coitus, licking, biting and sniffing tumor affected areas. The concept that the tumor is naturally transmissible as an allograft came from three important observations. First, CTVTs can only be experimentally induced by transplanting living tumor cells, and not by killed cells or cell filtrates. Second, the tumor karyotype is aneuploid but has characteristic marker chromosomes in all tumors collected in different geographic regions. Third, a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE-1) insertion near c-myc has been found in all tumors examined so far and can be used as a diagnostic marker to confirm that a tumor is a CTVT.\n\nThe CTVT cells have fewer chromosomes than normal dog cells. Dog cells normally have 78 chromosomes, while the cancer cells contain 57–64 chromosomes that are very different in appearance from normal dog chromosomes. All dog chromosomes except X and Y are acrocentric, having a centromere very near to the end of the chromosome, while many of the CTVT chromosomes are metacentric or submetacentric, having a centromere nearer to the middle. There is no evidence that the tumor is caused by a virus or virus-like organism. The infectious agent of canine transmissible venereal tumor is the cancer cell itself and the tumor is clonal in origin. All tumor cells of this type of cancer share extremely similar genetic code, often if not always unrelated to the DNA of their host. Specifically, the LINE-1 element in the tumor cells is in a different location than in normal canine DNA. This demonstrates that the tumors do not arise from separate cancerous transformation in individual animals. Rather, the malignant tumor cells from one dog are transferred to another.\n\nCanine transmissible venereal tumors are most commonly seen in sexually active dogs in tropical and subtropical climates. Canine transmissible venereal tumors are more often found in temperate climates where there are large populations of stray dogs, but little is known about the details of transmission. The disease is spread when dogs mate, and can even be transmitted to other canine species, such as foxes and coyotes. Spontaneous regression of the tumor can occur, probably due to a response from the immune system. CTVT undergoes a predictable cycle: an initial growth phase of four to six months (P phase), a stable phase, and a regression phase (R phase), although not all CTVTs will regress. The tumor does not often metastasize (occurring in about less than 5 percent of cases), except in puppies and immunocompromised dogs. Metastasis occurs to regional lymph nodes, but can also be seen in the skin, brain, eye, liver, spleen, testicle, rectum and muscle. A biopsy is necessary for diagnosis.\n\nThe tumor, when treated with the chemotherapy drug vincristine, regresses as the host immune system is activated. CCL5 may play an important role in the immune response.\n\nThe success of this single cell lineage, believed to be the longest continually propagated cell lineage in the world, can be attributed to the tumor's mode of transmission in a specific host system. Although direct contact is generally not a highly efficient mode of transfer, CTVTs take advantage of the popular sire effect of domestic dogs. A single male can produce dozens of litters over his lifetime, allowing the tumor to affect many more females than it could if a monogamous species were the host. Understanding the epidemiology of CTVTs could provide insights for populations that may experience CTVT exposure and information about disease prevalence.\n\nIn male dogs, the tumor affects the penis and foreskin. In female dogs, it affects the vulva. Rarely, the mouth or nose are affected. The tumor often has a cauliflower-like appearance. Signs of genital TVT include a discharge from the prepuce and in some cases urinary retention caused by blockage of the urethra. Signs of a nasal TVT include nasal fistulae, nosebleeds and other nasal discharge, facial swelling, and enlargement of the submandibular lymph nodes.\n\nSurgery may be difficult due to the location of these tumors. Surgery alone often leads to recurrence. Chemotherapy is very effective for TVTs. The prognosis for complete remission with chemotherapy is excellent. The most common chemotherapy agents used are vincristine, vinblastine, and doxorubicin. Radiotherapy may be required if chemotherapy does not work.\n\n"}

Spain's mineral wealth and access to metals made it an important source of raw material during the early metal ages. Carthage conquered parts of Iberia after the First Punic War. After defeating Carthage in the Second Punic War, the Romans governed all of the Iberian Peninsula for centuries, expanding and diversifying the economy and extending Hispanic trade with the greater Republic and Empire.\n\nWhile most of western Europe fell into a Dark Age after the decline of the Roman Empire, those kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula that today are known as Spain maintained their economy. First, the Visigoths replaced the Roman imperial administrators (an international class at the top echelons). They established themselves as nobility. The kingdom had some degree of centralized power at their capital, which was eventually moved to Toledo from Toulouse. The Roman municipal and provincial governorships continued but the imperial superstructure of diocese and prefecture was of course completely gone as there was no need for it: these had existed to coordinate imperial defense and provide uniform administrative oversight, and symbolized as nothing else, except the professional army, the presence of the Roman. Though it suffered some decline, most Roman law and much physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, aqueducts and irrigation systems, was maintained to varying degrees unlike the complete disintegration that occurred in most other former parts of the western empire with the exception of parts of Italy. Later, when the Moors occupied large parts of the Iberian Peninsula alongside the Catholic kingdoms, they also maintained much of this Roman legacy; in fact as time went on they had Roman infrastructure repaired and extended. Meanwhile, in the countryside, where most people had always lived, life went on much as it had in Roman times, but with improvements due to the repair and extension of irrigation systems, and the introduction of novel crops and agricultural practices from the Islamic world. While trade dwindled in most of the former Roman lands in Europe, trade survived to some degree in Visigothic Spain, and flourished under the Moors through the integration of Al-Andalus (Moorish Spain) with the Mediterranean trade of the Islamic world. After 800 years of intermittent warring, the Catholic kingdoms had gradually become more powerful and sophisticated and eventually expelled all the Moors from the Peninsula.\n\nThe Crown of Castile, united with the Crown of Aragon, had merchant navies that rivaled that of the Hanseatic League and Venice. Like the rest of late medieval Europe, restrictive guilds closely regulated all aspects of the economy-production, trade, and even transport. The most powerful of these corporations, the \"mesta\", controlled the production of wool, Castile's chief export.\n\nThe Reconquista allowed the Catholic Monarchs to divert their attention to exploration. In 1492, Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia, a Valencian) formally approved the division of the unexplored world between kingdoms of what is today Spain and Portugal. New discoveries and conquests came in quick succession.\n\nIn 1492, when Christopher Columbus brought 1,500 colonists with him on his second voyage, a royal administrator had already been appointed for what the Catholic kingdoms referred to as the Indies. The Council of the Indies (\"Consejo de Indias\"), established in 1524 acted as an advisory board on colonial affairs, and the House of Trade (\"Casa de Contratación\") regulated trade with the colonies.\n\nFollowing the discovery of America and the colonial expansion in the Caribbean and Continental America, valuable agricultural products and mineral resources were introduced into Spain through regular trade routes. New products such as potatoes, tomatoes and corn had a long-lasting impact on the Spanish economy, but more importantly on European demographics. Gold and silver bullion from American mines were used by the Spanish Crown to pay for troops in the Netherlands and Italy, to maintain the emperor's forces in Germany and ships at sea, and to satisfy increasing consumer demand at home. However, the large volumes of precious metals from America led to inflation, which had a negative effect on the poorer part of the population, as goods became overpriced. This also hampered exports, as expensive goods could not compete in international markets. Moreover, the large cash inflows from silver hindered the industrial development in Spain as entrepreneurship seems to be indispensable.\n\nDomestic production was heavily taxed, driving up prices for Aragon and Castile-made goods, but especially in Castile where the tax burden was greater. The sale of titles to entrepreneurs who bought their way up the social ladder (a practice commonly found all over Europe), removing themselves from the productive sector of the economy, provided additional funds.\n\nThe overall effect of plague and emigration reduced peninsular Spain's population from over 8 million in the last years of the 16th century to under 7 million by the mid-17th century, with Castile the most severely affected region (85% of the Kingdom's population were in Castile), as an example, in 1500, Castile 6 million, and 1.25 million in the Crown of Aragon which included Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands.\n\nThe Spanish economy diverged from the British economy in terms of GDP during the middle of the seventeenth century. The explanations for this divergence are unclear, but \"the divergence comes too late to have any medieval origins, whether cultural or institutional\" and \"it comes too early... in order for the Napoleonic Invasions to be blamed.\"\n\nA slow economic recovery began in the last decades of the 17th century under the Habsburgs. Under the Bourbons, government efficiency was improved, especially under Charles III's reign. The Bourbon reforms, however, resulted in no basic changes in the pattern of property holding. The nature of bourgeois class consciousness in Aragon and Castile hindered the creation of a middle-class movement. At the instance of liberal thinkers including Campomanes, various groups known as \"Economic Societies of friends of the Country\" were formed to promote economic development, new advances in the sciences, and Enlightenment philosophy (see \"Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País\"). However, despite the development of a national bureaucracy in Madrid, the reform movement could not be sustained without the patronage of Charles III, and it did not survive him.\n\nJan Bergeyck (advisor to Philip V) \"Disorder I have found here is beyond all imagination\".\nCastile's exchequer still used Roman numerals and there was no proper accounting.\n\nSpain's American colonies took advantage of the postwar chaos to proclaim their independence. By 1825 only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under the Spanish flag in the New World. When Ferdinand VII was restored to the throne in 1813 and expended wealth and manpower in a vain effort to reassert control over the colonies. The move was unpopular among liberal officers assigned to the American wars.\n\nThe economy was heavily focused around agricultural goods. The period saw regional industrialization in Catalonia and the Basque Country and the construction of railways in the second half of the nineteenth century helped alleviate some of the isolation of the interior but generally little changed for much of the country as political instability, uprisings and unstable governments slowed or undermined economic progress.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Spain was still mostly rural; modern industry existed only in the textile mills around Barcelona in Catalonia and in the metallurgical plants of the Basque provinces. The loss of Cuba and the Philippines benefited the Peninsula by causing capital to return and to be invested in updated domestic industries. But even with the stimulus of World War I, only in Catalonia and in two Basque provinces (Biscay and Guipuscoa) did the value of manufacturing output in 1920 exceed that of agricultural production. Agricultural productivity was generally low compared with that of other West European countries because of a number of deficiencies: backward technology, lack of large irrigation projects, inadequate rural credit facilities, outmoded landtenure practices, as well as the age old problems of difficult terrain, unreliable climate, isolation and difficult transportation in the rugged interior. Financial institutions were relatively undeveloped. The Bank of Spain (\"Banco de España\") was still privately owned, and its public functions were restricted to currency issuance and the provision of funds for state activities. The state largely limited itself to such traditional activities as defense and the maintenance of order and justice. Road building, education, and a few welfare activities were the only public services that had any appreciable impact on the economy.\n\nA General, Miguel Primo de Rivera, was appointed prime minister by the king after a successful coup d'état and for seven years dissolved parliament and ruled through directorates and the aid of the military until 1930.\n\nProtectionism, the Spanish neutrality during World War I (which allowed the country to trade with all belligerents) and state control of the economy led to a temporary economic recovery. The precipitous economic decline in 1930 undercut support for the government from special-interest groups. Criticism from academics mounted. Bankers expressed disappointment at the state loans that his government had tried to float. An attempt to reform the promotion system cost him the support of the army and, in turn, the support of the king. Primo de Rivera resigned and died shortly afterward in exile.\n\nThe republican government substituted the monarchy and inherited the international economic crisis as well. Three different governments ruled during the Second Spanish Republic, failing to execute numerous reforms, including land reform. General strikes were common and the economy stagnated.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the country split into two different centralized economies, and the whole economic effort was redirected to the war industry. According to recent research, growth is harmed during civil wars due to the huge contraction on private investment, and such was the case with the Spanish divided economy.\n\nSpain emerged from the civil war with formidable economic problems. Gold and foreign exchange reserves had been virtually wiped out, the massive devastation of war had reduced the productive capacity of both industry and agriculture. To compound the difficulties, even if the wherewithal had existed to purchase imports, the outbreak of World War II rendered many needed supplies unavailable. The end of the war did not improve Spain's plight because of subsequent global shortages of raw materials, and peacetime industrial products. Spain's European neighbours faced formidable post-war reconstruction problems of their own, and, because of their awareness that the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War had been achieved with the help of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, they had no inclination to include Spain in any multilateral recovery programs or trade. For a decade following the Civil War's end in 1939, the wrecked and isolated economy remained in a state of severe depression.\n\nBranded an international outcast for its pro-Axis bias during World War II, Spain was not invited to join the Marshall Plan. Francisco Franco's regime sought to provide for Spain's well-being by adopting a policy of economic self-sufficiency. Autarky was not merely a reaction to international isolation; it was also rooted in more than half a century of advocacy from domestic economic pressure groups. Furthermore, from 1939 to 1945, Spain's military chiefs genuinely feared an Allied invasion of the Peninsula and, therefore, sought to avert excessive reliance on foreign armaments.\n\nWith the war devastation and trade isolation, Spain was much more economically backward in the 1940s than it had been a decade earlier. Inflation soared, economic reconstruction faltered, food was scarce, and, in some years, Spain registered negative growth rates. By the early 1950s, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was barely 40% of the average for West European countries. Then, after a decade of economic stagnation, a tripling of prices, the growth of a black market, and widespread deprivation, gradual improvement began to take place. The regime took its first faltering steps toward abandoning its pretensions of self-sufficiency and towards a transformation of Spain's economic system. Pre-Civil War industrial production levels were regained in the early 1950s, though agricultural output remained below prewar levels until 1958.\n\nA further impetus to economic liberalization came from the September 1953 signing of a mutual defense agreement, the Pact of Madrid, between the United States and Spain. In return for permitting the establishment of United States military bases on Spanish soil, the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower administration provided substantial economic aid to the Franco regime. More than US$1 billion in economic assistance flowed into Spain during the remainder of the decade as a result of the agreement. Between 1953 and 1958, Spain's gross national product (GNP) rose by about 5% per annum.\n\nThe years from 1951 to 1956 were marked by much economic progress, but the reforms of the period were implemented irregularly, and were poorly coordinated. One large obstacle to the reform process was the corrupt, inefficient, and bloated bureaucracy. By the mid-1950s, the inflationary spiral had resumed its upward climb, and foreign currency reserves that had stood at US$58 million in 1958 plummeted to US$6 million by mid-1959. The growing demands of the emerging middle class—and of the ever-greater number of tourists—for the amenities of life, particularly for higher nutritional standards, placed heavy demands on imported food and luxury items. At the same time, exports lagged, largely because of high domestic demand and institutional restraints on foreign trade. The peseta fell to an all-time low on the black market, and Spain's foreign currency obligations grew to almost US$60 million.\n\nA debate took place within the regime over strategies for extricating the country from its economic impasse, and Franco finally opted in favor of a group of neoliberals. The group included bankers, industrial executives, some academic economists, and members of the Roman Catholic lay organization, Opus Dei.\n\nDuring the 1957-59 period, known as the pre-stabilization years, economic planners contented themselves with piecemeal measures such as moderate anti-inflationary stopgaps and increases in Spain's links with the world economy. A combination of external developments and an increasingly aggravated domestic economic crisis, however, forced them to engage in more far-reaching changes.\n\nAs the need for a change in economic policy became manifest in the late 1950s, an overhaul of the Council of Ministers in February 1957 brought to the key ministries a group of younger men, most of whom possessed economics training and experience. This reorganization was quickly followed by the establishment of a committee on economic affairs and the Office of Economic Coordination and Planning under the prime minister.\n\nSuch administrative changes were important steps in eliminating the chronic rivalries that existed among economic ministries. Other reforms followed, the principal one being the adoption of a corporate tax system that required the confederation of each industrial sector to allocate an appropriate share of the entire industry's tax assessment to each member firm. Chronic tax evasion was consequently made more difficult, and tax collection receipts rose sharply. Together with curbs on government spending, in 1958 this reform created the first government surplus in many years.\n\nMore drastic remedies were required as Spain's isolation from the rest of Western Europe became exacerbated. Neighboring states were in the process of establishing the EC and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA—see Glossary). In the process of liberalizing trade among their members, these organizations found it difficult to establish economic relations with countries wedded to trade quotas and bilateral agreements, such as Spain.\n\nSpanish membership in these groups was not politically possible, but Spain was invited to join a number of other international institutions. In January 1958, Spain became an associate member of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), which became the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in September 1961. In 1959 Spain joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. These bodies immediately became involved in helping Spain to abandon the autarkical trade practices that had brought its reserves to such low levels and that were isolating its economy from the rest of Europe.\n\nIn December 1958, after seven months of preparation and drafting, aided by IMF, Spain unveiled its Stabilization Plan on June 30, 1959. The plan's objectives were twofold: to take the necessary fiscal and monetary measures required to restrict demand and to contain inflation, while, at the same time, liberalizing foreign trade and encouraging foreign investment. The plan's initial effect was deflationary and recessionary, leading to a drop in real income and to a rise in unemployment during its first year. The resultant economic slump and reduced wages led approximately 500,000 Spanish workers to emigrate in search of better job opportunities in other West European countries. Nonetheless, its main goals were achieved. The plan enabled Spain to avert a possible suspension of payments abroad to foreign banks holding Spanish currency, and by the close of 1959, Spain's foreign exchange account showed a US$100-million surplus. Foreign capital investment grew sevenfold between 1958 and 1960, and the annual influx of tourists began to rise rapidly, bringing in very much needed foreign exchange along remittances from Spanish workers abroad.\n\nAs these developments steadily converted Spain's economic structure into one more closely resembling a free-market economy, the country entered the greatest cycle of industrialization and prosperity it had ever known. Foreign aid took the form of US$75 million in drawing rights from the IMF, US$100 million in OEEC credits, US$70 million in commercial credits from the Chase Manhattan Bank and the First National City Bank, US$30 million from the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and funds from United States aid programs. Total foreign backing amounted to US$420 million. The principal lubricants of the economic expansion, however, were the hard currency remittances of one million Spanish workers abroad, which are estimated to have offset 17.9% of the total trade deficit from 1962 to 1971; the gigantic increase in tourism that drew more than 20 million visitors per year by the end of the 1960s, accounting by then for 9% of GNP; a car industry that grew at a staggering compound rate of 21.7% per year from 1958 to 1972; and direct foreign investment, which between 1960 and 1974 amounted to an impressive US$7.6 billion. More than 40% of this investment came from the United States, almost 17% came from Switzerland, and the Federal Republic of Germany and France each accounted for slightly more than 10%. By 1975 foreign capital represented 12.4% of the total invested in Spain's 500 largest industrial firms. More important than the actual size of the foreign investment was the access it gave Spanish companies to up to date technology. An additional billion dollars came from foreign sources through a variety of loans and credit devices.\n\nTo help achieve rapid development, there was massive government investment through key state-owned companies like the national industrial conglomerate Instituto Nacional de Industria, the mass-market car company SEAT in Barcelona, the shipbuilder Empresa Nacional Bazán. With foreign access to the Spanish domestic market restricted by heavy tariffs and quotas, these national companies led the industrialisation of the country, restoring the prosperity of old industrial areas like Barcelona and Bilbao and creating new industrial areas, most notably around Madrid. Although there was considerable economic liberalisation in the period these enterprises remained under state control.\n\nThe success of the stabilization program was attributable to a combination of good luck and good management and the impressive development during this period was referred to as the \"Spanish miracle\". Between 1959 and 1974, Spain had the next fastest economic growth rate after Japan. The boom came to an end with the oil shocks of the 1970s and government instability during the transition back to democracy after Franco's death in 1975.\n\nFranco's death in 1975 and the ensuing transition to democratic rule diverted Spaniards' attention from their economy. The return to democracy coincided with an explosive quadrupling of oil prices, which had an extremely serious effect on the economy because Spain imported 70% of its energy, mostly in the form of Middle Eastern oil. Nonetheless, the interim centrist government of Adolfo Suarez Gonzalez, which had been named to succeed the Franco regime by King Juan Carlos, did little to shore up the economy or even to reduce Spain's dependence on imported oil, although there was little that could be done as the country had little in the way of hydrocarbon deposits. A virtually exclusive preoccupation with the politics of democratization during the politically and socially unstable period when the new constitution was drafted and enacted, absorbed most of Spain's politics and administration at the expense of economic policy.\n\nBecause of the failure to adjust to the changed economic environment brought on by the two oil price shocks of the 1970s, Spain quickly confronted plummeting productivity, an explosive increase in wages from 1974 to 1976, a reversal of migration trends as a result of the economic slump throughout Western Europe, and the steady outflow of labor from agricultural areas despite declining job prospects in the cities. All these factors contributed to a sharp rise in the unemployment rate. Government budgetary deficits swelled, as did large social security cost overruns and the huge operating losses incurred by a number of public-sector industries. Energy consumption, meanwhile, remained high.\n\nWhen the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party government headed by Felipe González took office in late 1982, inflation was running at an annual rate of 16%, the external current account was US$4 billion in arrears, public spending was large, and foreign exchange reserves had become dangerously depleted. In coping with the situation, however, the Gonzalez government had one asset that no previous post-Franco government had enjoyed, namely, a solid parliamentary majority in both houses of the Cortes (Spanish Parliament). With this majority, it was able to undertake unpopular austerity measures that earlier governments had not.\n\nThe Socialist government opted for pragmatic, orthodox monetary and fiscal policies, together with a series of vigorous retrenchment measures. In 1983 it unveiled a program that provided a more coherent and long-term approach to the country's economic ills. Renovative structural policies—such as the closing of large, unprofitable state enterprises—helped to correct the relatively poor performance of the economy. The government launched an industrial reconversion program, brought the problem-ridden social security system into better balance, and introduced a more efficient energy-use policy. Labor market flexibility was improved, and private capital investment was encouraged with incentives.\n\nBy 1985 the budgetary deficit was brought down to 5% of GNP, and it dropped to 4.5% in 1986. Real wage growth was contained, and it was generally kept below the rate of inflation. Inflation was reduced to 4.5% in 1987, and analysts believed it might decrease to the government's goal of 3% in 1988.\n\nEfforts to modernize and to expand the economy together with a number of factors fostered strong economic growth in the 1980s. Those factors were the continuing fall in oil prices, increased tourism, and a massive upsurge in the inflow of foreign investment. Thus, despite the fact that the economy was being exposed to foreign competition in accordance with EC requirements, the Spanish economy underwent rapid expansion without experiencing balance of payments' constraints.\n\nIn the words of the OECD's 1987-88 survey of the Spanish economy, \"following a protracted period of sluggish growth with slow progress in winding down inflation during the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, the Spanish economy has entered a phase of vigorous expansion of output and employment accompanied by a marked slowdown of inflation.\" In 1981 Spain's GDP growth rate had reached a nadir by registering a rate of negative 0.2%; it then gradually resumed its slow upward ascent with increases of 1.2% in 1982, 1.8% in 1983, 1.9% in 1984, and 2.1% in 1985. The following year, however, Spain's real GDP began to grow strongly, registering a growth rate of 3.3% in 1986 and 5.5% in 1987. Although these growth rates were less than those of the economic miracle years, they were among the strongest of the OECD. Analysts projected a rise of 3.8% in 1988 and of 3.5% in 1989, a slight decline but still roughly double the EC average. They expected that declining interest rates and the government's stimulative budget would help sustain economic expansion. Industrial output, which rose by 3.1% in 1986 and by 5.2% in 1987, was also expected to maintain its expansive rate, growing by 3.8% in 1988 and by 3.7% in 1989.\n\nA prime force generating rapid economic growth was increased domestic demand, which grew by a steep 6% in 1986 and by 4.8% in 1987, in both years exceeding official projections. During 1988 and 1989, analysts expected demand to remain strong, though at slightly lower levels. Much of the large increase in demand was met in 1987 by an estimated 20% jump in real terms in imports of goods and services.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Spain achieved a strong level of economic performance while simultaneously lowering its rate of inflation to within two points of the EC average. However, its export performance, though increasing, raised concerns over the existing imbalance between import and export growth.\n\nAfter Franco's death in 1975, the country returned to democracy in the form of a constitutional monarchy in 1978, with elections being held in 1977 and with the constitution being ratified in 1978. The move to democracy saw Spain become more involved with the European integration.\n\nFelipe Gonzalez became prime minister when his Socialist Party won the 1982 elections. He enacted a number of liberal reforms, increasing civil liberties and implementing universal free education for those 16 and younger. He also lobbied successfully for Spain to join the European Economic Community (EEC) and to remain part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nThe European Union at the time Spain joined, in 1986, existed primarily as a trading union - the EEC, and better trade links were vital to the fragile Spanish economy. Unemployment was high, about 18 percent, and the Spanish GDP was 71 percent of the EU average. The single market and European funding offered a chance to bring the Spanish economy up to the standards of the rest of Western Europe, along with the support of Spain's wealthier neighbors. There was the promise of lucrative deals with influential countries such as Germany, France and the UK.\n\nAlthough the Spanish Miracle years (1959–1974) witnessed unprecedented improvements in infrastructure and social services, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe. Education was limited, women were largely excluded from the workforce, health care was largely private and unevenly distributed and the country's infrastructure was relatively poor. In 1985, Spain had only of motorways. Since the end of the economic miracle in 1974, the country's economy had been stagnant. Joining the European Economic Community was perceived by most of the population as a way to restart the process of modernization and improvement of the population's average purchasing power.\n\nSpain joined the European Economic Community, as the European Union was then known, in January 1986 at the same time as neighbor Portugal. Membership ushered the country into opening its economy, modernizing its industrial base and revising economic legislation to open its previously protected markets to foreign competition. With help of EU funds (Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds, European Regional Development Fund, etc.) Spain greatly improved infrastructures, increased GDP growth, reduced the public debt to GDP ratio.\nSpain has been a driving force in the European community ever since. The country was a leading proponent of the EU single currency, the euro, long before it had been put into circulation. Together with the other founding euro members, it adopted the new physical currency on January 1, 2002. On that date Spain terminated its historic peseta currency and replaced it with the euro, which has become its national currency shared the rest of the Eurozone. This culminated a fast process of economic modernization even though the strength of the euro since its adoption has raised concerns regarding the fact that Spanish exports outside the European Union are being priced out of the range of foreign buyers, with the country losing monetary sovereignty in favour of the European Central Bank, which must look after several different -often opposed- national interests.\n\nIn the early 1990s Spain, like most other countries, was hit by the early 1990s recession. which coincided with the end of the construction push put in place for the Barcelona Olympics.\n\nThe country was confronted with very high unemployment, entrenched by its then rigid labour market. However the economy began to recover during the first José María Aznar administration (1996-2000), driven by a return of consumer confidence, increased private consumption and liberalization and deregulation reforms aiming to reduce the State's role in the market place. Unemployment at 7.6% (October 2006), represented a significant improvement from the 1980s levels and a better rate than the one of Germany or France at the time. Devaluations of the peseta during the 1990s made Spanish exports more competitive.\nBy the late 1990s economic growth was strong, employment grew strongly, although unemployment remained high, as people returned to the job market and confidence in the economy returned. The last years of the 1990s saw property values begin to increase.\n\nThe Spanish economy was being credited for having avoided the virtual zero growth rate of some of its largest partners in the EU (namely France, Germany and Italy) in the late 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century. In 1995 Spain started an impressive economic cycle marked by an outstanding economic growth, with figures around 3%, often well over this rate. \n\nGrowth in the decade prior to 2008 steadily closed the economic gap between Spain and its leading partners in the EU. For a moment, the Spanish economy was regarded as one of the most dynamic within the EU, even able to replace the leading role of much larger economies like the ones of France and Germany, thus subsequently attracting significant amounts of native and foreign investment. Also, during the period spanning from the mid 1980s through the mid 2000s, Spain was second only to France in being the most successful OECD country in terms of reduced income inequality over this period. Spain also made great strides in integrating women into the workforce. From a position where the role of Spanish women in the labour market in the early 1970s was similar to that prevailing in the major European countries in the 1930s, by the 1990s Spain had achieved a modern European profile in terms of economic participation by women.\n\nSpain joined the Eurozone in 1999. Interest rates dropped and the property boom accelerated. By 2006 property prices had doubled from a decade earlier. During this time construction of apartments and houses increased at a record rate and immigration into Spain increased into the hundreds of thousands a year as Spain created more new jobs than the rest of Eurozone combined. Along with the property boom, there was a rapid expansion of service industry jobs.\n\nDue to its own economic development and the EU enlargements up to 27 members (2007), Spain as a whole exceeded (105%) the average of the EU GDP in 2006 placing it ahead of Italy (103% for 2006). As for the extremes within Spain, three regions in 2005 were included in the leading EU group exceeding 125% of the GDP average level (Madrid, Navarre and the Basque Autonomous Community) and one was at the 85% level (Extremadura). These same regions were on the brink of full employment by then.\n\nAccording to the growth rates post 2006, noticeable progress from these figures happened until early 2008, when the Spanish economy was heavily affected by the puncturing of its property bubble by the global financial crisis.\n\nIn this regard, according to Eurostat's estimates for 2007 GDP per capita for the EU-27. Spain happened to stay by that time at 107% of the level, well above Italy who was still above the average (101%), and catching up with countries like France (111%).\n\nIn 2008, the shockwaves of the global financial crisis punctured the Spanish property bubble, causing a property crash. Construction collapsed and unemployment began to rise. The property crash led to a collapse of credit as banks hit by bad debts cut back lending, causing a recession. As the economy shrank, government revenue collapsed and government debt began to climb rapidly. By the 2010 the country faced severe financial problems and got caught up in the European sovereign debt crisis. In 2012, unemployment rose to a record high of 25 percent. On 25 May 2012, Bankia, at that time the fourth largest bank of Spain with 12 million customers, requested a bailout of €19 billion, the largest bank bailout in the nation's history. The new management, led by José Ignacio Goirigolzarri reported losses before taxes of 4.3 billion euros (2.98 billion euros taking into account a fiscal credit) compared to a profit of 328 million euros reported when Rodrigo Rato was at the head of Bankia until May 9, 2012. On June 9, 2012, Spain asked Eurozone governments for a bailout worth as much as 100 billion euros ($125 billion) to rescue its banking system as the country became the biggest euro economy until that date, after Ireland, Greece and Portugal, to seek international aid due to its weaknesses amid the European sovereign debt crisis. A Eurozone official told Reuters in July 2012 that Spain conceded for the first time at a meeting between Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos and his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble, it might need a bailout worth 300 billion euros if its borrowing costs remained unsustainably high. On August 23, 2012, Reuters reported that Spain was negotiating with euro zone partners over conditions for aid to bring down its borrowing costs.\n\nAfter serious austerity measures and major reforms into the economy Spain exited recession in 2013 and its economy is growing once more at a rate of 2.5 in 2015 and it is only expected to improve over the coming years. Although jobs are starting to be created the unemployment still stands at 22.6% in April 2015.\n\nIn 2014, after years of economic recession, Spain grew up a 1,4%, accelerating to 3.4% in 2015 and 3.3% in 2016 and moderating by 3.1% in 2017. Experts say that the economy will moderate in 2018 to stable growth of between 2.5% and 3%. In addition to this, the unemployment rate has been reduced during the years of recovery, standing at 16.55% in 2017.\n\n\n"}

It is both unwise and useless to undertake to dictate to Russia concerning her internal affairs.\" But assumed that they would not be welcome in western countries, \"Where shall 2,000,000 of such poor people go? Europe is crowded and has no room for more peasant population. Shall they come to America? This will be a tremendous expense, and require years.\" \nThere was a solution:\n\n\"Why not give Palestine back to them again? According to God's distribution of nations it is their home, an inalienable possession from which they were expelled by force.\"\n\n\"Why shall not the powers which under the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, gave Bulgaria to the Bulgarians and Servia to the Servians now give Palestine back to the Jews? These provinces, as well as Roumania, Montenegro, and Greece, were wrested from the Turks and given to their natural owners. Does not Palestine as rightfully belong to the Jews?\"\n\nThe Memorial petition was circulated in five major cities: Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Chicago. It was signed by 431 prominent citizens from those cities: financiers John D. Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan, future President William McKinley, and Chief Justice Melville Fuller; many members of Congress; the editors of all major newspapers in those five cities, including the still-extant \"Boston Globe\", \"The New York Times\", \"Chicago Tribune\", \"Philadelphia Inquirer\", and \"The Washington Post\"; and a long list of university and seminary presidents, mayors, and leading businessmen. The Memorial was presented to President Harrison with little result.\n\nThe Blackstone Memorial was turned over to the State Department archives for safe keeping. It has been lost since. All knowledge of the Blackstone Memorial are derived from newspaper reports of the period and biographies of the major people involved. A copy of the Memorial can be found in the Blackstone archives at the Billy Graham Center on the campus of Wheaton College.\n\nMay 16, 1916, Nathan Straus, at the behest of (later Supreme Court Justice) Louis Brandeis wrote Rev. Blackstone. “Mr. Brandeis is perfectly infatuated with the work that you have done along the lines of Zionism. It would have done your heart good to have heard him assert what a valuable contribution to the cause your document is. In fact he agrees with me that you are the Father of Zionism, as your work antedates Herzl\".\n\nAfter the initial contact, Brandeis asked Rev. Blackstone to prepare for presentation to President Woodrow Wilson a second Blackstone Memorial. The purpose of the second Memorial was to influence President Wilson to support the developing Balfour Declaration. Rev. Blackstone, though 75 years of age, energetically undertook the mission. Of central importance to the second Memorial was the securing by Rev. Blackstone of the endorsements of the Presbyterian Church and most of the mainstream American Protestant movement. President Wilson was a deeply religious Presbyterian. The second Memorial was presented privately to President Wilson May, 1917. The Memorial strongly influenced President Wilson to let the British government of Lloyd George know of American sympathy in favor of the Balfour Declaration. The second Blackstone Memorial was never publicly presented.\n\n"}

Initially signed to Casablanca Records, they achieved significant rock radio airplay with \"I Could Be Good for You\", written by McFadden and McClarty. It peaked at No. 52 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song was featured on their first album, simply entitled \"707\". McFadden left the band before their second album. \"I Could Be Good For You\" was included in the Adam Sandler film, \"Grown Ups.\"\n\n\"Strings Around My Heart\" failed to repeat their first single's success, but that did not stop \"The Second Album\" from hitting the charts, peaking at No. 159 in the Billboard 200 in 1981. Recording sessions began for a third album, \"The Bridge\", featuring the addition of keyboardist/guitarist Tod Howarth. While being musically inventive and clearly demonstrating Howarth's influence, the recordings languished unreleased for 18 years due to contract disputes.\n\nDuring 1981, 707 performed \"Tonite's Your Night\" on \"The Midnight Special\".\n\nThe third 707 album was recorded in 1981 after completing a tour together opening for REO Speedwagon. The line-up was Kevin Russell (guitar), Phil Bryant (vocals/bass), Jim McClarty (drums) and Todd Howarth (keys/guitar). The album was shelved until it was finally released in 2004. \n\nThe band departed Casablanca, and signed with Boardwalk Records, re-joining Bruce Bird and Neil Bogart, who had originally signed the band to Casablanca. In the tradition of other successful bands of the 1960s (The Beatles) and 1970s (Styx, Journey), 707 did not have a single lead vocalist, and featured different band members taking lead vocals on different tracks; some songs even featured different vocalists within the same song. The label decided that 707 needed a single, distinguishable vocal front man, and Kevin Chalfant was added to the Megaforce lineup to take that role.\n\nThe result of those changes was the band's most successful album, \"Mega Force\". The album peaked at No. 129 in 1982. The title track, originally recorded as the theme to the motion picture \"Megaforce\", repeated the success of their first hit, reaching No. 12 on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock charts and rising to No. 62 on the Hot 100.\n\nThe band played for stadium crowds as the opening act for several successful acts at their commercial peak, including Ted Nugent, Loverboy, Scorpions, Rainbow and REO Speedwagon's tour in support of their album \"Good Trouble\". Despite that success, the group disbanded in 1983 due to internal strife within the band.\n\nChalfant later enjoyed some success in the early 1990s with The Storm. After a hiatus from music in the mid-1990s, he has remained active in solo and group projects, and has stepped in as temporary lead vocalist for Journey (1993) and The Alan Parsons Project (2003).\n\nTod Howarth enjoyed success with Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley's solo outing which re-wrote \"Mega Force\" with Jonathan Cain's writing credit removed and Frehley's added. They titled the song \"Calling To You\" since Ace did not want to use the name Megaforce since he was signed to Megaforce Records). Howarth had stints in Ted Nugent's band, his own solo career, and as a longtime touring keyboardist for Cheap Trick.\n\nKevin Russell fashioned a successful career as a record producer and guitarist for numerous acts, including Rick Derringer, Clarence Clemons, and Whitesnake.\n\nAfter parting from 707, Jim McClarty worked in television and audio production before devoting himself to the ministry. He is currently a pastor near Nashville, Tennessee. In 2006 he returned to his 707 roots, mastering the band's album \"The Fourth Decade\" for Renaissance Records.\n\nDuke McFadden died on April 5, 2005, from heart complications.\n\nIn 2000, 707 regrouped briefly around guitarist Russell and independent record label releases have featured early demos, live tracks, and new material, as well as CD re-releases of their 1980s albums.\n\n"}

Mavericks Stadium, a city-owned $6.5 million facility, opened on April 23, 1991. The green of the baseball diamond sharply contrasts the surrounding desert landscape.\n\nFan support in the High Desert was a Minor League success story in their first year. In 1991, the Mavericks became the first team in the California League to draw over 200,000 fans in one season. In 1996, the Mavericks drew their one-millionth fan, becoming one of the fastest teams to reach that milestone.\n\nIt is known as an extraordinarily hitter-friendly ballpark.\n\nThe Mavericks' Luke Tendler hit the final California League home run in Heritage Field at Maverick Stadium and the Mavericks history with a solo shot in the bottom of the 8th inning on September 17, 2016. The 7 - 4 victory over the Visalia Rawhide was the Mavericks final game in the stadium, as the team was contracted out after the season.\n\nThe attendance for the final game ever played at Heritage Field at Maverick Stadium was 1,991. 1991 was also the same year that the Mavericks began play.\n\nIt was reported that Heritage Field at Maverick Stadium was trashed, with about $10,000 in damages done to the stadium after the Mavericks final game on September 17, 2016. Adelanto Mayor Rich Kerr called it a “petulant act of vandalism,” and it included damages to the Mavericks locker room, field and concourse.\n\nAfter the California League contracted the league to eight teams by eliminating the High Desert Mavericks (along with the Bakersfield Blaze) at the end of the 2016 season, the City of Adelanto struck a deal with the San Bernardino County Fair (28th District Agricultural Association) to manage and market the stadium. That contract lasted one year and was not renewed at the end of 2017. In February 2018 the city council voted to retain control of the stadium and hired a contract employee to manage day to day operations on behalf of the city. \n\nFor the stadium's first 16 years, it was called Mavericks Stadium. It received its \"Stater Bros. Stadium\" name in 2007 when Stater Bros., a supermarket chain based in San Bernardino bought the naming rights. In 2014, it was renamed Heritage Field at Stater Bros. Stadium when a naming-rights deal was signed between the Mavericks and the Heritage Victor Valley Medical Group. In 2015, the name was updated to Heritage Field at Maverick Stadium. With the Mavericks leaving at the end of the 2016 season, the facility is now simply called \"Adelanto Stadium\"\n\n"}

The village magistrate, Colyus, tells them 22 people have disappeared without a trace in the past few days. Odo and Dax offer to help investigate the disappearances; but the oldest villager, Rurigan, seems unconvinced that the villagers will ever be found.\n\nThe next day, Odo interviews Rurigan's granddaughter, Taya, whose mother has disappeared. The two find common ground in that they are both orphans; during the course of their conversation, Taya reveals that the villagers never leave their valley. Rurigan assures Odo that searching beyond the valley would be pointless.

When she does so, the village and all the villagers vanish – except Rurigan. He explains that when the Dominion arrived on his home planet, he fled to an abandoned planet and recreated the world he had lost; but now he admits that none of it was real. However, Odo argues that Taya and the others are real and deserve a chance to live. Dax and Rurigan repair the reactor, restoring the village, including the missing people.

His early life is obscure but while serving on a coasting vessel he is known to have been captured by a French privateer during the Napoleonic Wars in 1805, and held prisoner until 1814. He later joined the merchant navy and as master of a transport vessel traveled to Greenland as part of William Parry's expedition.\n\nIn 1829 he was appointed master of works in Fernando Po, an island in the Gulf of Guinea nominally belonging to Spain but which the British were using to establish a base against the slave trade. Demonstrating a talent for negotiating successfully with local people, in 1830 Beecroft was appointed acting governor by Spain (with rank of lieutenant in the Spanish navy) when Edward Nicolls (then governor) returned to England unwell. Realising Spain was not willing to cede control of the island the British left in 1833 but Beecroft effectively continued in the role of acting governor, even holding a court of justice, although at this point he was also agent of a trading company. In 1843 Spain formally made him governor of Fernando Po and two other Spanish possessions. In 1849 he was appointed Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra by the British, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854.\n\nDuring his time as governor Beecroft explored the interior of Africa using steam ships to navigate far up the Niger River, the Cross River and the Benin River, an area official British expeditions failed to penetrate. The secret of his success was not only his use of modern European naval technology but employing local Africans as crew, since they had greater resistance to the malaria which claimed numerous European lives before the effectiveness of quinine as a protection was understood. After he became consul he assisted in the British bombardment of Lagos in 1851, negotiated (and was a signatory to) the Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852, and was instrumental in the deposition of Pepple, King of Bonny, in 1854.\n\nBeecroft was preparing for another expedition to the Niger River when he died on 10 June 1854 and was buried on Fernando Po. His place on the expedition was taken by William Balfour Baikie. His widow, Mrs. Ellen Beecroft, later received a pension in the Civil List in recognition of her husband's contribution to the suppression of the slave trade and advancement of British interests on the coast of Africa.

In 1993 a rural Georgian rugby union club team defected to the Russian Rugby League; the club and all of its players were banned from playing rugby union for life.\n\nIn 2004 Paata Tsintsadze established rugby league in Georgia, with the backing of the Rugby League European Federation. In June 2004 the Georgia Rugby League (GRL) was incorporated, and recognised by the State Sports Ministry. Nodar Andghuladze was the first Chief Executive Officer and David Kilassonia the coaching manager.

The winner of that pool would qualify for the 2008 World Cup with the runner up entering the Repecharge round. However, their final first round fixture against Russia was abandoned after the Georgian team had their visa applications rejected.

The cornerstone of Old East was laid ceremoniously on October 12, 1793 by William Richardson Davie, who served as the governor of North Carolina from 1798 to 1799. The building was originally two stories tall and contained sixteen rooms. The design reflects the University trustees' vision of a quadrangle that ran north toward the town of Chapel Hill. Although the cost of construction is unknown, there are records from 1799 indicating that the University spent a total of $12,180 for work on Steward's Hall, Old East, Person Hall, and the President's House. After its construction, Old East functioned as both a classroom building and a Residence Hall; today it is exclusively a Residence Hall.\n\nThe contractor in charge of the construction of Old East was James Patterson of Chatham County. By 1804, the building needed significant repairs and was renovated with new doors, window sashes, ladders, and the roof was repainted. The third story was added to the building in 1823. Alexander Jackson Davis was hired by the University in 1844 to lengthen the building by a third and to create a new north entrance. The new rooms were used by the Philanthropic Society and also served as a library. Davis' other additions included large north-facing windows encased by brick panels and two brick porches on the east side of the building. Thomas Day, a skilled and respected African-American cabinetmaker, designed and built the interior woodwork in the society rooms. Old East remained the home of the Philanthropic Society until New East was completed in 1860.\n\nIn 1877, Zebulon Baird Vance, the Governor of North Carolina and chair of the Board of Trustees, declared the anniversary of Old East's construction, October 12, was University Day and should \"be observed with appropriate ceremonies under the direction of the faculty.\" Subsequent celebrations of University Day have included speeches by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 and President Bill Clinton in 1993. Students are released from classes the morning of University Day and many migrate to the Old East Birthday Bash, which has in the past included things like cake, athletic signings, puppies, appearances by the chancellor, dance routines, and \"a capella\" performances. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service December 21, 1965. The residence hall is staffed with two Resident Advisers who are notorious for wearing striking safety vests during emergency procedures and in order to increase visibility on the hall.\n\nThe Old Well and Old East, as the earliest buildings at UNC, have long been the symbols of the university. There are some collections of art about Old East and the Old Well in Blowing Rock Art and History Museum, North Carolina, as well as in UNC-Chapel Hill's Wilson Library. It is located in the Chapel Hill Historic District.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for baseball and is the home field of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes minor league baseball team. It was opened on April 3, 1993, with the nickname The Epicenter, and has a seating capacity of 6,588 people. While playing home games at the stadium since 1993, the Quakes have broken a number of stadium attendance records.\n\nIn 1992, the San Bernardino Spirit were playing at Fiscalini Field, when it was announced that a new ballpark would be built in Rancho Cucamonga for over $20 million. At the time, this was a large amount of money to spend on a new minor league ballpark. The Spirit (soon renamed the Quakes) jumped at the chance to play in this new ballpark and moved in 1993, switching their affiliation from the Seattle Mariners to the San Diego Padres.\n\nConstruction started on November 14, 1991, which much of the staff for the Quakes moving into trailers on the outskirts of the construction site. The process used 400 trucks of concrete, and over 95,000 cubic yards of dirt were moved. Officially named \"The Quake\" after a public vote, the stadium was then nicknamed the \"Epicenter.\" The team moved into the stadium on April 1, 1993.\n\nThe Rancho Cucamonga Quakes played their first game at the stadium on April 8 against the High Desert Mavericks, winning 7-3. Early demand for tickets was high, and on May 22, over 440 temporary bleacher seats were added to the stadium. By July, the team broke the California League attendance record of 218,444, ending the season with a record of 331,005, fourth of any Class-A team in the country, and better than any Class AA team that year. After that season, more seats were installed in the outfield area, bringing capacity over 6,000. After a championship win in 1994, attendance went up in 1995, with the team playing to a 97% filled capacity that year. In 1996, the Quakes again topped the attendance rate in the league for the fourth season in a row.\n\nAfter the completion of the 2009 season, the Quakes baseball team was sold to Brett Sports & Entertainment. In 2011 the team Quakes began a partnership with the Los Angeles Dodgers. As of 2014, the stadium's property encompasses a 52-acre sports complex. Its close proximity to the film studios of Los Angeles means a number of movies have been filmed there, and the stadium has also hosted concerts, non-baseball sporting events, vehicle shows and exhibitions, community events and festivals.\n\nOn April 3, 2013, it was announced that the chain LoanMart had signed a ten-year sponsorship and naming rights deal with the franchise, renaming the ballpark LoanMart Field. Founded in 2002, 1-800LoanMart is a direct financer and lending company based in Encino. The company operates as a \"non-traditional\" lending service to car-owners; instead of looking at credit scores to establish eligibility for loans, the company uses the actual value of the client's vehicle and the client's ability to repay the loan as collateral, while allowing use of the car. As of March 2014 the company has over 330 employees and does business in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Illinois, and Missouri. LoanMart also sponsors other sports-related franchises including NASCAR Sprint Cup.\n\nOther sponsors of the stadium and team beyond LoanMart include Allstar KIA, Budweiser, the California National Guard, Pepsi, and many other diverse companies.\n\nBetween the 2008 and 2009 seasons, the existing seats were replaced, with the old seats recycled, sealing all the cracks and holes in the concrete around the entire stadium, and installing the new and improved seats into place. There are no changes in the capacity for the stadium. However, the numbers on the first base side (sections 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15) are numbered differently from before. The sections now have the number one on the right when facing the field and the largest number of the row on the left when facing the field. The new seats are navy blue and are equipped with a cup holder for each seat. The lower levels, Super Box and Field Box, are now padded.\n\nPrior to the 2012 season, the stadium's home and away clubhouses underwent major renovations to meet Minor League Baseball standards. The home clubhouse was renamed the Tommy Lasorda Clubhouse on March 28, 2013, before the start of a special exhibition game between the Quakes and their MLB affiliate, the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nDuring the offseason leading up to the 2013 season, the stadium's left field bleachers were removed in favor of the Batting Cage Terrace, where fans can watch players take batting practice in an open batting cage adjacent to the home bullpen. During the games, fans have the opportunity to take abbreviated batting practice rotations.\n\n"}

Wadsworth (1790–1851). The ship was commissioned in 1943 during World War II. After seeing extensive action during the war, the ship was placed in reserve following it. In 1959 the destroyer was loaned to the West German Navy and renamed Zerstörer 3. She remained a part of the West German Navy until 1980 when the destroyer was transferred to the Hellenic Navy and renamed Nearchos. \"Nearchos\" was active until 1991 when she was sold for scrap.\n\n\"Wadsworth\" was laid down on 18 August 1942 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works. The destroyer was launched on 10 January 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Rebecca Wadsworth Peacher, the great-great-granddaughter of Commodore Alexander S. Wadsworth; and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard, on 16 March 1943, Commander John F. Walsh in command.\n\n\"Wadsworth\" departed Boston on 5 April and conducted exercises in Casco Bay, Maine, until 15 April, when she sailed for Cuban waters. After shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, the new destroyer steamed north for post-shakedown availability and voyage repairs in the Boston Navy Yard.\n\nPutting to sea on 23 May, \"Wadsworth\" screened the aircraft carriers and out of Port of Spain, Trinidad, as they conducted training evolutions. Following that cruise, \"Wadsworth\" touched at Norfolk, Virginia, on 17 June and returned to Boston the following day.\n\nAfter escorting the aircraft carrier to Hampton Roads, Virginia, \"Wadsworth\" screened and planeguarded for that carrier as her air group trained off the Virginia Capes. Following a return to Boston, the destroyer got underway again on July 20 to rendezvous with a task group formed around the carriers , \"Princeton\", and . She met the carriers off the Delaware breakwater, and the warships then set a southerly course, bound for the Panama Canal.\n\nReaching Pearl Harbor on 9 August, \"Wadsworth\" spent 10 days in the Hawaiian operating area before heading for Canton Island in the screen for the carrier . Subsequently, touching Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides Islands, \"Wadsworth\" reported to Rear Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch, Commander, Aircraft, South Pacific (ComAirSoPac), for duty.\n\nOn the last day of August 1943, \"Wadsworth\" cleared Espiritu Santo to hunt for the Japanese submarine—later identified as —that had torpedoed and damaged the tanker \"W. S. Rheem\" about north of Bougainville Strait. \"Wadsworth\" made no contact with any submarines in the first area searched but then teamed with amphibious patrol planes to scour the seas to the south of Espiritu Santo and west of Nalekula Island.\n\nHer diligence was soon rewarded. On 1 September, \"Wadsworth\" picked up an underwater sound contact and dropped seven patterns of depth charges and claimed unconfirmed damage to the submersible. \"I-20\" may have survived that onslaught but never returned home. Records list her as \"missing\" as of 10 October 1943.\n\nPutting into Havannah Harbor, Efate Island, on 6 September, \"Wadsworth\" then exercised with a task force formed around the carrier . The destroyer subsequently cleared that port on 17 September in company with the mine-laying destroyer and, over the ensuing days, escorted a convoy of supply ships to Kukum beach, Guadalcanal.\n\nReturning to Efate with empty cargo ships on 30 September, \"Wadsworth\" took a screening station near the battleship to escort her to the west for a rendezvous with a cruiser-battleship striking force under the command of Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee. \"Wadsworth\" then patrolled off Meli Bay, Efate, to cover the entrance of convoys into Havannah Harbor.\n\n\"Wadsworth\" subsequently joined other units of Destroyer Division 45 (DesDiv 45) as part of the protective screen for a dozen troop transports, Task Group 31.5 (TG 31.5), bound for the Solomons and the initial landings of men in Empress Augusta Bay, Cape Torokina, Bougainville. The expeditionary force arrived off the beach at Cape Torokina in the early morning darkness on 1 November. Then \"Wadsworth\" led in the initial force, a group of minesweepers, into Empress Augusta Bay.\n\nAt 05:47, \"Wadsworth\"'s guns began to bark, and her shells destroyed enemy barges along the shoreline. For nearly two hours, the warship blasted targets behind the beaches, before she and sister ship took a patrol station to protect the transports which were landing troops. Suddenly, six enemy planes plunged out of the sun at the two destroyers, and the first of six bombs exploded only to starboard of \"Wadsworth\". Two other bombs burst within of her beam, one to starboard and one to port. Then, a near-miss from her port side sprayed the after section of the ship with fragments that killed two \"Wadsworth\" sailors and wounded nine others. On the other hand, the two destroyers each destroyed two of the attackers.\n\nStanding out of the unloading area on the night of 1 November, \"Wadsworth\" patrolled off Koli Point, Guadalcanal. Early in the morning a week later, the destroyer returned to Bougainville, escorting the second echelon of troop transports to Empress Augusta Bay. On this occasion, \"Wadsworth\" took a fighter-director station off the transport area and assisted in repelling a noon enemy air attack, her guns claiming one dive bomber and one torpedo plane.\n\nClearing Cape Torokina shortly before midnight, \"Wadsworth\" patrolled off Guadalcanal until 10 November, when she moved to Purvis Bay, Florida Island. However, she soon returned to Bougainville's coastal waters, escorting a troop convoy. The destroyer arrived off Cape Torokina near midnight on 12 November and, before dawn, had repelled two torpedo attacks with her radar-controlled 5-inch gunnery.\n\n\"Wadsworth\" operated in support of the Bougainville occupation through the end of 1944, escorting troop-and supply-laden convoys from Kukum beach, Guadalcanal, to Empress Augusta Bay. From time to time, she also carried out shore bombardment missions. Three days after Christmas 1943, she blasted Japanese trenches and gun emplacements on both the south and north sides of the mouth of the Reini River, aided by air spot.\n\nAfter returning to Purvis Bay from her last screening and escort missions in support of the Bougainville operation, \"Wadsworth\" departed the Solomons on 8 January 1944, bound for Pago Pago, American Samoa, escorting a merchantman. She returned to Espiritu Santo shepherding the replenishment ship , before she steamed to Guadalcanal as part of the escort for the transport . She then put into Blanche Harbor, Treasury Islands, on 1 February.\n\nThat day, \"Wadsworth\" conducted an anti-shipping sweep off the Buka Passage, trading shells with an enemy shore battery on Buka Island, before she entered Bougainville Strait in company with the destroyers and . The three destroyers then proceeded to bombard the newly constructed Japanese airfield at Choiseul Island.\n\nSubsequently, taking on ammunition at Hawthorne Sound, New Georgia, \"Wadsworth\" left on the night of 1 February to exercise with motor torpedo boats off Rendova. The following day off Blanche Harbor, she joined the screen for a convoy of landing craft and cargo ships that had arrived off Cape Torokina on 4 February.\n\nNear midnight, she helped to repel enemy air attacks on the Torokina beaches, before she left the area the next morning, screening the tanker to Purvis Bay.\n\nClearing Purvis Bay on 11 February, \"Wadsworth\" rendezvoused with destroyers and troop-laden LSTs off Munda, New Georgia, bound for the Green Islands. Before dawn on 15 February, \"Wadsworth\", acting as fighter-director ship, vectored night fighters toward an enemy raid of five planes that dropped flares off the formation. As a result of the destroyer's instructions, the prowling night fighters knocked down one enemy floatplane. At dawn, \"Wadsworth\" vectored fighters against another raid, during which they splashed three intruders and repelled the enemy without damage to any ship of the formation. \"Wadsworth\" then screened the transports as they disembarked their troops.\n\nAfter putting into Purvis Bay on the night of 17 February, \"Wadsworth\" steamed to Kukum beach and joined a troop convoy earmarked for the Green Island occupation. After her charges had safely delivered their troops to the objective on 20 February, \"Wadsworth\" returned to Purvis Bay the next afternoon.\n\nGetting underway on 23 February, \"Wadsworth\" steamed via St. George's Channel to Kavieng, New Ireland, and to Rabaul, New Britain, for an anti-shipping sweep. A few minutes after midnight on 24 February, the destroyer opened fire and shelled a supply dump, stowage houses, and enemy troop concentrations in that area. One salvo of 5-inch shells started a fierce fire that lit up the entire target area. The flames from that blaze were still glowing as \"Wadsworth\" and the rest of the bombardment force stood down St. George's Channel three hours later.\n\nWith Purvis Bay as her base of operations, \"Wadsworth\" escorted supply convoys to Green Island and from Guadalcanal to Cape Torokina until 17 March. That day, the destroyer joined the screen for high-speed transports (APDs) setting course from Guadalcanal for the landings on Emirau Island.\n\nOn the morning of 19 March, \"Wadsworth\" took a patrol station near Emirau and remained in the vicinity, supporting the operation, until sunset on 20 March. She subsequently conducted two more Guadalcanal-to-Emirau runs—escorting troopships—that kept her busy through mid-April.\n\nAfter a period of rest and recreation at Sydney, Australia, \"Wadsworth\" returned to Havannah Harbor on 10 May. Assigned to duty with Battleship Division 3 (BatDiv 3)—comprising , , and —\"Wadsworth\" engaged in battle maneuvers and training off the New Hebrides in preparation for the conquest of the Marianas. While his ship lay moored in Havannah Harbor on 31 May, \"Wadsworth\"s commanding officer, Comdr. John F. Walsh, was given the additional duty of Commander, Destroyer Division 90 (DesDiv 90), and broke his pennant in his ship.\n\nOn 2 June, \"Wadsworth\" and the other destroyers in her squadron and with BatDiv 3 formed Task Group 53.14 (TG 53.14) and cleared Havannah Harbor, bound for the Marianas. At 04:30 on 14 June, the destroyer joined the screen of \"Pennsylvania\", \"Idaho\", and the cruiser for the bombardment of shore installations on eastern Tinian. She completed the initial phase of her operations in the Marianas on the 16th by screening bombardment-force cruisers and battleships off Guam.\n\nAfter refuelling off Saipan, \"Wadsworth\" joined Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher's Task Force 58 (TF 58) on the afternoon of 17 June, becoming a part of TG 58.3, formed around the veteran aircraft carrier in TF 58's bid to repel the First Japanese Mobile Fleet then on its way to the Marianas. On the morning of 19 June, TG 58.3 came under attack from Japanese carrier- and land-based aircraft during the beginning of what history would record as the Battle of the Philippine Sea.\n\nSometimes known as the \"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\", that battle sounded the death knell for the Imperial Japanese Navy. During the action, the enemy lost 395 carrier planes and 31 floatplanes—about 92% and 72% of its total strength in those categories. At the end of its ill-fated effort to defend the Marianas, the Japanese Navy retained the operational use of only 35 carrier planes and 12 float planes. Besides the losses afloat, the Japanese lost some 50 land-based bombers as well.\n\nDuring the two-day battle, Vice Admiral Mitscher's fliers had done well, turning back the enemy raids before they reached the American fleet. As TF 58 steamed westward to destroy the fleeing enemy on 20 June, Mitscher ordered further air strikes—attacks that sank the Japanese carrier .\n\nMitscher had taken a calculated risk, however, launching the last strikes so late in the day. As the planes droned home in the gathering darkness, the admiral faced an agonizing decision. Many planes would be lost if they could not see their carriers. On the other hand, if the ships were illuminated, enemy submarines might also see the vital carriers. Mitscher ordered the lights turned on. Meanwhile, \"Wadsworth\" and other destroyers received orders to pick up any fliers who were forced to \"ditch.\"\n\nWhen TF 58 had reached a point some off Okinawa, it abandoned further pursuit of the Japanese. \"Wadsworth\" then returned to the Marianas and patrolled off Saipan. On 5 July, her commanding officer was relieved of his collateral duties as ComDesDiv 90.\n\nTwo days later, \"Wadsworth\" joined a cruiser-destroyer force under Rear Admiral C. Turner Joy for the bombardment of Tinian. The destroyer and her mates soon shifted their attention to Guam and destroyed many shore installations and gasoline dumps at Apra Harbor and Agana Harbor, besides blasting enemy airstrips well in advance of the landings scheduled for that island. Terminating her bombardment duties off Guam on the afternoon of 12 July, \"Wadsworth\" joined the screen for the retiring carriers, and , and reached Eniwetok, in the Marshall Islands, on 15 July.\n\nHowever, the respite provided by that in-port period was brief, for \"Wadsworth\" proceeded to sea on 17 July, as part of the escort for troop-laden transports slated to put their combat-garbed marines and soldiers ashore on Guam. \"Wadsworth\" patrolled off that isle as those men splashed ashore and, while engaged in that duty offshore, picked up eight natives of Guam, who had escaped from the Japanese, on the morning of 22 July. The destroyer quickly transferred them to , because they possessed valuable intelligence information on Japanese dispositions ashore.\n\n\"Wadsworth\"s guns again spoke in the invasion of Guam on the night of 24 and 25 July, before she took a radar picket station between Guam and Rota Islands. Relieved by the destroyer on 2 August, \"Wadsworth\" then spent four days acting as primary fighter-director ship off Agana beach for two divisions of fighters based on the carriers \"Belleau Wood\", , and . Relieved of that duty on 6 August, \"Wadsworth\" departed Guam on 10 August, screening fleet oilers as they withdrew to Eniwetok.\n\nPressing on from the Marshalls for Hawaiian waters on 13 August as escort for a merchantman, \"Wadsworth\" reached Pearl Harbor on the 20th. She then operated off Oahu on radar picket patrols. She departed Hawaiian waters on 15 September as part of the escort for the carriers and , heading for the Marshalls. Arriving there on 25 September, the destroyer reported for duty with the 3d Fleet.\n\nThat tour of duty proved brief, however; for, soon thereafter, \"Wadsworth\" sailed for the West Coast of the United States. Proceeding via Eniwetok, Ulithi, and Pearl Harbor, the destroyer arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 25 October for a major overhaul and completed that period of repairs and alterations on 5 December.\n\n\"Wadsworth\"—shifted from DesRon 45 to DesRon 24—then conducted refresher training evolutions at San Diego before departing San Francisco five days before Christmas and heading for the Hawaiian Islands as an escort for a convoy. The destroyer safely conducted her charges into Oahu's waters on 29 December 1944.\n\nAfter local maneuvers out of Pearl Harbor—during which she rescued three aviators from the water on 2 January 1945—\"Wadsworth\" set course via Ulithi for the Kossol Passage, Palau Islands.\n\nReaching the Palaus on 16 January, \"Wadsworth\" relieved the destroyer as tender for four minesweepers and two subchasers (SCs) engaged in patrols between Peleliu and Angaur Islands. In the early morning darkness two days later, she illuminated a target heading for the transport area and received information that there were no friendly small craft in the vicinity. \"Wadsworth\"s searchlight continued to illuminate the small boat—a barge—as it beached, where Army searchlights ashore soon fixed their beams upon it. Men began to debark from the craft, just as small arms fire began to crackle. Some 50 Japanese troops had attempted a daring raid to damage American aircraft on the ground and destroy ammunition, only to be foiled by \"Wadsworth\" and the Army troops ashore. The Japanese landing party was exterminated.\n\nDuring the night of 19 January, \"Wadsworth\" provided illuminating gunfire support for troops on \"Amber\" beach, Peleliu, before she sailed on 25 January for Ulithi. There, she joined the screen of TG 51.1, a transport group slated to take part in the invasion of Iwo Jima.\n\nTouching at Apra Harbor, Guam, between 8 and 16 February, \"Wadsworth\" arrived off Iwo Jima on the morning of 19 February. The destroyer then conducted antisubmarine patrols off the southern tip of the island until nightfall, when she joined a bombardment group. The next morning, \"Wadsworth\" took station in the fire support sector off Iwo Jima and blasted enemy tanks and mortar and rocket positions. She continued that action in support of the ground troops ashore until the afternoon of the 21st, when she resumed screening duty for transports carrying the occupation force which ultimately landed on 2 March.\n\nClearing Iwo Jima on 5 March, \"Wadsworth\" headed for the Philippines, arriving at Dulag anchorage, in Leyte Gulf, on the 9th. For most of the rest of March, \"Wadsworth\" operated locally in Philippine waters, conducting bombardment and fire support exercises in San Pedro Bay, off Leyte, until 27 March. On that day, the destroyer got underway, screening the sortie of a transport group bound for the Ryūkyūs.\n\n\"Wadsworth\" arrived off Okinawa on the morning of 1 April 1945—Easter Sunday, April Fools' Day, and D day for that operation. At 04:15, the destroyer completed an advance sweep ahead of the transports off the invasion beaches and then took a fire support station off the southern end of the island. For the next 15 days, \"Wadsworth\"s guns blasted Japanese troop concentrations and gun emplacements, as well as caves where the fanatical defenders had holed-up.\n\nOn 17 April, \"Wadsworth\" took on board a fighter-director team at Kerama Retto; and technicians from the command ship assisted the destroyer's ship's force in installing fighter-director equipment. She sailed later that day on her first radar picket assignment, part of the early warning network to provide the alarm of incoming Japanese aircraft. From 17 April to 24 June, \"Wadsworth\" carried out nine assignments on station, repelling 22 attacks by enemy aircraft, shooting down six, and assisting in the destruction of seven others. In addition, the combat air patrol fighters that she directed splashed 28 enemy aircraft.\n\nDuring one day of that duty, on 28 April 1945, \"Wadsworth\" repelled six determined attacks by 12 enemy aircraft. The raids—which came from all points of the compass—commenced at sunset and continued for over three hours. One enemy torpedo plane closed fast on her port beam as \"Wadsworth\" skillfully maneuvered to keep the enemy on the beam to allow a heavy concentration of antiaircraft fire. Frustrated in his first attempt, the enemy pilot then brought the plane around a second time, circling to the right to commence an attack from directly astern, strafing as he came.\n\n\"Wadsworth\" maneuvered to port as the plane went into a power dive that took him within of the waves before he passed the destroyer to starboard at a distance of about . The Japanese then zoomed sharply and turned to cross in front of \"Wadsworth\". He then opened the range before boring in low and fast on the third attack.\n\n\"Wadsworth\"'s determined adversary then dropped a torpedo at . The destroyer turned \"left full\" and the \"fish\" passed harmlessly by her starboard side. Meanwhile, under constant fire from every gun in \"Wadsworth\" that could be brought to bear, the enemy plane came on, attempting to crash into the ship.\n\nThe Japanese bore in through the flak-peppered skies. His wing struck the forward port 40-millimeter gun, and the main body of the plane spun into the gig rigged outboard, carried away a life raft, and then smashed a motor whaleboat before falling into the sea. Providentially, the enemy did not explode; the ship did, however, receive a shower of debris and gasoline. That had been the ship's second narrow escape. Only six days previously, on 22 April, \"Wadsworth\"s gunners had shot down a \"kamikaze\" that exploded in the sea only 20 feet from the ship, showering the ship with fragments. Fortunately, only minor hull damage resulted, and only one sailor was wounded.\n\nAt Hagushi anchorage on the morning of 24 June, \"Wadsworth\", relieved of radar picket duty, put her fighter-director team ashore. Since her first arrival off Okinawa, she had sounded general quarters 203 times, detected and reported the approach of hundreds of enemy aircraft, and successfully fought off all that attacked her. Her exploits during that time earned her the Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nDeparting Okinawa on 24 June, \"Wadsworth\" anchored in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 27 June. She spent a fortnight in Philippine waters before getting underway with a group of heavy cruisers. The force touched at Okinawa on 16 July and then headed for the East China Sea for anti-shipping sweeps off the coast of China between the ports of Foochow and Wenchow. Returning to Okinawa on 29 July, that force made a similar sweep during the first week of August.\n\nAfter \"V-J Day\" in mid-August, \"Wadsworth\" remained in the Far Eastern area, clearing Okinawa on 12 September, bound for Nagasaki, Japan, as escort for two LSTs. Reaching that atomic bomb-devastated port two days later, \"Wadsworth\" assisted in the evacuation of Allied prisoners of war from that port. On 18 September, she received on board a total of 125 liberated men, American, British, Dutch, and Australian, and transported them to Okinawa, reaching Buckner Bay on 20 September.\n\nClearing Buckner Bay on 25 September, \"Wadsworth\" arrived at Sasebo, Japan, the next day. Soon thereafter, she commenced transport and occupation duties, carrying troops and escorting their vital supply ships between Sasebo, Wakayama, and Yokosuka—duties in which she remained engaged through mid-November.\n\nDeparting Sasebo on 17 November 1945, \"Wadsworth\" headed for the United States, her occupation service completed. Sailing via the Hawaiian Islands, the destroyer reached San Diego between 6 and 10 December and disembarked returning veterans at that port before she headed on for Panama. Transiting the Panama Canal soon thereafter, \"Wadsworth\" arrived at the Charleston Naval Shipyard in South Carolina two days before Christmas 1945 and reported for inactivation.\n\nDecommissioned on 18 April 1946, \"Wadsworth\" was assigned to the Charleston Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. The destroyer remained inactive until selected for transfer to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1959 under the Military Assistance Program.\n\nIn the summer of 1959, the German transfer crew assembled at Charleston, South Carolina, for indoctrination, while the ship herself was being prepared for turnover. On 6 October 1959, \"Wadsworth\" was turned over to the West German \"Bundesmarine\" and simultaneously commissioned in their service as \"Zerstörer 3\" (D172). Her first commander was the former Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients of the \"Kriegsmarine\" \"Fregattenkapitän\" Wilhelm Meentzen.\n\nAfter her initial six-year loan period was extended, \"Zerstörer 3\" remained with the West German navy into the 1970s. Struck from the United States Navy List on 1 October 1974, the ship was sold to the Federal Republic of Germany on that date. She remained active with the West German navy until 30 October 1980, when she was transferred to Greece.\n\nIn the Hellenic Navy, the ship was renamed \"Nearchos\" (D65).\nShe was stricken and scrapped in 1991.\n\n\"Wadsworth\" (DD-516) earned seven battle stars for her World War II service, and a Presidential Unit Citation (US):\n\n"}

Breyer from 1995 to 1996.\n\nHe was a professor at New York University School of Law from 1996 to 2003, and visited at Yale Law School and Harvard Law School (during 2002–2003), before joining the Yale Law School faculty in 2003. In 2007, Benkler joined Harvard Law School, where he teaches and is a faculty co-director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. Benkler is on the advisory board of the Sunlight Foundation. In 2011, his research led him to receive the $100,000 Ford Foundation Social Change Visionaries Award. He is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.\n\nBenkler's research focuses on commons-based approaches to managing resources in networked environments. He coined the term 'commons-based peer production' to describe collaborative efforts based on sharing information, such as free and open source software and Wikipedia. He also uses the term 'networked information economy' to describe a \"system of production, distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed, nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies.\"\n\nBenkler's 2006 book \"The Wealth of Networks\" examines the ways in which information technology permits extensive forms of collaboration that have potentially transformative consequences for economy and society. Wikipedia, Creative Commons, Open Source Software and the blogosphere are among the examples that Benkler draws upon. (\"The Wealth of Networks\" is itself published under a Creative Commons license.) For example, Benkler argues that blogs and other modes of participatory communication can lead to \"a more critical and self-reflective culture\", where citizens are empowered by the ability to publicize their own opinions on a range of issues, which enables them to move from passive recipients of \"received wisdom\" to active participants. Much of \"The Wealth of Networks\" is presented in economic terms, and Benkler raises the possibility that a culture in which information is shared freely could prove more economically efficient than one in which innovation is encumbered by patent or copyright law, since the marginal cost of re-producing most information is effectively nothing.\n\nAlong with Robert Faris, Research Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, and Hal Roberts, a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, Benkler co-authored the October 2018 \"Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation and Radicalization in American Politics\".\n\nAccording to Benkler, the emergence of the networked information economy \"has the potential to increase individual autonomy\", which he means would provide individuals with a richer basis from which they can form critical judgement concerning how they should live their life.\n\nBenkler coined the term 'Jalt' as a contraction of jealousy and altruism, to describe the dynamic in commons-based peer production where some participants get paid while others do not, or \"whether people get paid differentially for participating.\" The term was first introduced in his seminal paper \"Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and the Nature of the Firm.\" It is described in more technical terms as \"social-psychological component of the reward to support monetary appropriation by others or... where one agent is jealous of the rewards of another.\"\n\nBenkler appeared in the documentary film \"Steal This Film\", which is available through Creative Commons. He discussed various issues, including: \"how the changing cost structures in film and music production are enabling new stratums of society to create.\"\n\nBenkler is a strong proponent of WikiLeaks, characterizing it as a prime example of non-traditional media filling a public watchdog role left vacant by traditional news outlets. In a draft paper written for the \"Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review\" in February 2011, he uses governmental vilification and prosecution of Wikileaks as a case study demonstrating the need for more robust legal protection for independent media.\n\nIn August 2011, Benkler was a keynote speaker at the Wikimania conference in Haifa, Israel. That same August, Benkler's latest book on social cooperation online and off, titled \"The Penguin and the Leviathan: How Cooperation Triumphs over Self-Interest\", was published. Benkler discussed this book at a lecture given at Harvard on October 18, 2011.\n\nBenkler contributed the essay \"Complexity and Humanity\" to the Freesouls book project, which discusses the human element in production and technology.\n\n\n\n"}

The story revolves around two impecunious young men, Ramdas (Mohanlal) and Vijayan (Sreenivasan) who not being able to find any job in Kerala, plan to immigrate to Dubai to make their fortunes, but get deceived and end up in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. \"Nadodikkattu\" drew upon relevant social factors affecting Kerala of the 1980s such as widespread unemployment and poverty.\n\nThe film also stars Thilakan, Shobhana, Innocent, Mamukkoya, Captain Raju, Meena, Kundara Johny, Janardhanan, Ajith Kollam, and Sankaradi in pivotal roles along with cameo appearances by Seema, I. V. Sasi, and M. G. Soman as themselves. The film represents popular Malayalam cinema at its satirical best and established the Mohanlal-Sreenivasan combination as one of its most memorable and bankable cinematic pairs. The story, screenplay and characters have achieved cult status. The film showed an extraordinary talent of late actor Thilakan who played the role of Ananthan Nambiar. Thilakan proved himself that he can handle comedy roles also.\n\nThe film was produced by Casino Productions, a production company owned by Century Kochumon, Mohanlal, I. V. Sasi, Seema, and Mammootty. It gave way to two sequels\"Pattanapravesham\" (1988) and \"Akkare Akkare Akkare\" (1990) .\n\nThe film was remade by Muktha V. Srinivasan in Tamil as \"Katha Nayagan\" (1988) and in Kannada as \"Tenali Rama\". Plot elements were also used in the 2006 Hindi comedy film \"Bhagam Bhag\".\n\nThe film was also remade in Telugu in which Chandra Mohan played the role of Vijayan.\n\nRamdas/Dasan (Mohanlal) and Vijayan (Sreenivasan) are employed as ill-paid peons. A commerce graduate, and proud of that, Dasan frequently vents his frustration in having to serve lesser qualified superiors and having to settle with lesser than what he feels he deserves in life. Vijayan is his less educated roommate and sole friend. Their relationship is one full of comic tension, with Dasan adopting a superior stance on the account of his education and good looks, which fiercely rattles Vijayan. Several comic situations later in the film borrow from this aspect of their characters. Dasan frequently bosses over Vijayan to do all the household chores.\n\nDasan and Vijayan, hopeful of getting a better job, as soon as the new managing director joins their company, wait for him to take charge. However, one day, on their way to work, they get involved in an unnecessary altercation with an unknown person. Dasan, in order to grab attention from a lady, verbally abuses the person and pushes him into a puddle of rainwater. Vijayan punctures his car tires. But when they reach the workplace, they find out that the person that they had picked the fight with is their new managing director. Both vanish from the workplace and reappear on the next day in disguise; Dasan wearing dark sunglasses and Vijayan wearing a long beard. Both try to convince their supervisor that they were seriously ill the previous day, but they are made to report to the new managing director. They manage to fool him initially and start work but the managing director soon finds out the truth from old office photographs and both get thrown out from work.\n\nBeing jobless, their landlord (Sankaradi) convinces them to borrow a loan from a bank to buy two cows. Dasan and Vijayan, upbeat about the new business, start dreaming of a bright future. However, they soon find out that the cows yield very little milk and the business fails. The bank contacts them for defaulting on the loan repayments. To escape, Vijayan sells the cows and arranges for them to go to Dubai (in United Arab Emirates) with whatever money they get. Gafoor (Mamukkoya) is an agent who promises to take them to the Persian Gulf. Gafoor explains to them that his uru (boat) sailing to California will be diverted past the Dubai coast for them. Gafoor also instructs them to wear traditional Arabic clothing thawb to fool the authorities. Dasan and Vijayan once again start dreaming about the bright and luxurious life ahead.\n\nOn reaching the sea shore, both change into the Arabic attire. Two strangers (Johny and Ajith Kollam) follow Dasan and Vijayan and forcefully exchange their suitcases. Confused, Dasan and Vijayan start exploring the city. They are surprised to see no Arabs in the city and soon find signboards in Tamil. They realize that they have been cheated by Gafoor who has off loaded them in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Dasan and Vijayan check the suitcase and find drugs inside. They contact local police and hand over the suitcase.\n\nMeanwhile, the strangers who are actually gang members of Ananthan Nambiar (Thilakan), a smuggler and underworld don, find out that they were mistaken. Ananthan Nambiar believes that those men in Arabic dress were Crime Investigation Department officers in disguise.\n\nDasan and Vijayan with the help of Dasan’s friend Balan (Innocent) get jobs at Ananthan Nambiar’s office. Dasan meets his colleague Radha (Shobana) who turns out to be their neighbour as well. But soon Dasan and Vijayan get fired by Ananthan Nambiar who believes that they are undercover officers. On the road again, Vijayan tries to get a chance to act in films. He visits noted film director I. V. Sasi’s home and meets Sasi’s wife, actress Seema.\n\nDasan starts a small push-cart vegetable business with Radha’s help. A minor romance develops between Dasan and Radha. Meanwhile Ananthan Nambiar hires contract killer Pavanayi (Captain Raju) to murder Dasan and Vijayan. Pavanayi arrives at Chennai airport with a briefcase containing his ‘tools of trade’. He opens the box and displays various options for killing the targets: a bomb, a gun, a set of arrows and even a traditional Malappuram dagger. Very soon Pavanayi becomes an object of ridicule because of his boasting nature. However, Pavanayi dies while trying to kill Dasan and Vijayan. This irks Ananthan Nambiar even more and makes him all the more paranoid about these two \"officers\".\n\nAs the story proceeds to the climax, Dasan and Vijayan are called to a rundown factory by one of their other enemies, Kovai Venkatesan (Janardhanan), a well-connected businessman with political aspirations for an ostensible meeting, where he plans to kill them. Dasan and Vijayan find themselves surrounded by Ananthan Nambiar’s gang as well, the latter also having selected the location to finalize a drug deal. However, the both gangs mistake each other as enemies and a mixed fight breaks out. Dasan and Vijayan manage to lock all the others inside the building as the police arrive and arrest everyone.\n\nThe movie concludes as Dasan and Vijayan gets selected into the Tamil Nadu police as Crime Investigation Department officers and they along with Radha drive away in a jeep.\n\n\nThe film was produced by Casino Productions, a film production house co-owned by Century Kochumon, Mohanlal, I.V. Sasi, Seema and Mammootty, on a shoe-string budget of Rs 17 lakh.\n\nThe characters of Dasan and Vijayan were replicated from a story formulated by famous director duo Siddique and Lal who were working as assistant directors then. Sathyan Anthikkad discussed these characters to Sreenivasan who later developed them into a screen play. It was later revealed that Sathyan Anthikkad asked Sreenivasan to give a different treatment to the climax, thus they were able to come up with an agreeable climax for the script than that to the first version. Later they had creative differences during the same climax shooting and even stopped talking to each other. However, being best of friends, they re-united during dubbing of the film.\n\nThe film received excellent reviews.\n\nThe film was a huge box office grosser doing well not only in Kerala but other neighbouring states and the Persian Gulf as well. The story and screenplay is considered as one of the classics of mainstream Malayalam films, portraying a cross-section of Kerala's social issues at the time, primarily the struggle of unemployed Malayali youths and the means they pursue to find employment, such as seeking job opportunities in the Persian Gulf region, the scramble for formal educational qualifications (reflected through the character Ramdas' boasting about his graduate degree in commerce with First Class), etc., through amusing comic dialogues. These dialogues are still remembered fondly by Malayalis today. This movie has been considered as the best example of the Mohanlal-Sreenivasan on-screen combination, spawning two sequels with the same duo, \"Pattanapravesham\" and \"Akkare Akkare Akkare\", as well as a spin-off film called \"Mr. Pavanayi 99.99\".\n\nThe movie is considered as one of the most popular Malayalam movies of all time. Even after more than 25 years, the movie draws huge audience whenever it is telecast on television channels. \"The secret of the duo still being alive in the Malayali's consciousness may be because it's a story of two unemployed youngsters told using a humorous narrative. Unemployment was one of the biggest issues and migration to greener pastures was typical of Malayali experience. This has continued to the current decade. So, the audience has no problem relating to Dasan and Vijayan,\" says Sathyan Anthikkad, who directed the movie. According to Anthikkad, it was the convergence of a script-writer, director and actors at the subtlest level that resulted in its success.\n\n\"Comedies were not much in demand here before films such as Nadodikattu happened. Lal and I were instrumental in popularising comedies to a great extent.\" says Siddique.\n"}

The song was played at Ottawa Senators games in 1992, after which Pat Burns, then coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs, insisted it be played in Toronto as well. The song is now played throughout both Canadian and American NHL arenas, as well in the home arenas of European hockey teams (e.g. Dinamo Rīga of the KHL).\n\nThe verses of the song are split up so that each one describes a period of play in a typical hockey game. In the first verse Connors sings, \"Someone roars, Bobby scores!\". In the last verse Connors sings that it is the last game of the playoffs and the \"Stanley Cup is all filled up for the champs that win the drink\". He later also sings \"The puck is in, the home team wins!\". In concert he would sometimes change \"home team\" to an actual team based on where he was playing. One example was at the closing ceremonies for Maple Leaf Gardens, when he changed the last game line from the playoffs to \"the Garden\", and mentioned that the Leafs have won.\n\nIn the song's chorus, Connors sings, \"The good old hockey game is the best game you can name, and the best game you can name is the good old hockey game.\"\n\nThe song has been covered numerous times. One cover version was used in combination with Connors' recording as the theme song for the 1990s CTV series, \"Power Play\", while another was used to open NHL broadcasts on CTV Sportsnet in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIn 2004, the American comedy-talk show \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" taped a week's worth of shows in Canada. During one of these telecasts, Connors, making one of the first American TV appearances of his entire career, was brought on to perform \"The Hockey Song\".\n\nWith the expiration of CBC Television's licence of \"The Hockey Theme\" for \"Hockey Night in Canada\" in 2008, Connors let it be known that he would be open to an appropriate licensing offer for his song as a replacement theme song. \n\n\"The Hockey Song\" was re-recorded in 2008 by Connors as the \"new 2008 version\" and was featured on his studio album, \"The Ballad of Stompin' Tom\". Connors thought that the original recording in the 1970s was \"too thin\".\n\nIn 2011, a cover of the song was used by NBC Sports in a promo for the 2012 NHL Winter Classic. Multiple fans produced versions of the song with lyrics changed to reflect the 2012–13 labour disputes.\n\nOn March 6, 2013, Great Big Sea performed \"The Hockey Song\" in concert in San Francisco as a tribute to Stompin' Tom Connors, who had died earlier that day.\n\nOn October 27, 2018 the song was added to the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, with a ceremony at an NHL game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Winnipeg Jets at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, including a performance by country singer Tim Hicks and a plaque presentation to Connors' son and family.\n\n"}

He was widely acknowledged as an international expert in the rescue and rehabilitation of abused primates, and in the enforcement of international treaties aimed at protecting them from illegal trade and experimentation.\n\nCronin was awarded an honorary MBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 for services to animal welfare.\n\nCronin was born in Yonkers, New York, to Italian-Irish parents. The son of a union official, he was educated at St Denis School and Lincoln High School. He had a number of jobs after leaving school before becoming a keeper at Bronx Zoo in the 1970s. While working there he realised he wanted to work with animals. In 1980 he moved to Kent in the UK to work in John Aspinall's zoo.\n\nCronin started his work with primates through working as a zoo keeper in various zoos. In 1980 he came to Britain where he acquired a job as a zoo keeper at John Aspinall's zoo at Howletts, where he perfected his skills of primate rehabilitation and care. John Aspinall had set up a breeding programme for gorillas which were an endangered species. Cronin's passion for working with primates made him quite successful in his career and encouraged him to have an ambition of one day building a safe haven for mistreated primates. During his years working at John Aspinall's Zoo, he gave himself the necessary experience of dealing with apes on a daily basis in his career path of working with them as well as small monkeys and their complex life necessities.\n\nIt was during Cronin's years working as a zoo keeper at the Howletts Zoo that he was notified about the plight of chimps being abused. These African great apes were being smuggled from the wild by illegal poachers and being transported abroad to Europe, where the young chimpanzees were being purchased then used as photographic props by photographers on beach resorts in Spain. These chimps would suffer horrible abuse – having their teeth knocked out to prevent them biting tourists, drugged to remain sedate, and physically beaten to remain submissive and easy to handle before growing too big and being killed to be simply replaced by another. Cronin was infuriated by the fate that these magnificent apes encountered and decided to dedicate his life in trying to solve the problem.\n\nIn the middle 1980s Spain had released legislation that forbade the use of chimpanzees as photographer's props, and this turn of action gave Cronin some optimism on how he would reach his goal of helping the chimps. In 1986 Cronin approached a British couple called Simon and Peggy Templer who had started rescuing the beach chimps in 1978. Cronin worked together with the Templers who had set up a half-way house where the confiscated chimps were being housed. The chimps would not be able to stay there for long, and it was Cronin's idea that shed light. Cronin requested discussions on how he could possibly help and with the assistance of the Spanish authorities (the Guardia Civil) confiscating the chimps, there would certainly be more individuals arriving at the small half-way house.\n\nDuring 1987 Cronin returned to England and focused on how he could possibly build a sanctuary for the chimps. The Templers agreed to re-home the chimps at the sanctuary which Cronin promised to be able to build. Cronin recruited help from his best friend Jeremy Keeling, who was a fellow zoo keeper, and the pair set out to achieve their ambition of a primate sanctuary. Cronin was notified about an abandoned pig farm located near Wool, Dorset. The old land covered 65 acres and would be perfect for what would become a primate rescue centre.\n\nAfter securing a small business loan, Cronin acquired permission to build the first enclosure which would be for the chimps. He knew that the animals needed to know how to live a natural way of life again, therefore Cronin set up a map of the enclosure which would cover two acres, filled with grass, shrubs and custom-built climbing structures made from telephone poles. The whole two acres would be surrounded by an electric fence. After some finishing touches, such as human resources like a café and a children's playground, the sanctuary was finally complete and was named Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre.\n\nIn July 1987, Cronin was able to bring the first group of nine chimps from the Templers' half-way house to Monkey World. Once at the park, the chimpanzees were rehabilitated and housed in their new accommodations. Also within the park was one hand-reared female Bornean orang-utan named Amy, who was brought by Jeremy Keeling, whose job it was to look after the animals at the centre. There was the arrival of some Barbary macaques, pig-tailed macaques and some ring-tailed lemurs, which made up the rest of the collection of primates housed in Cronin's rescue centre. More chimpanzees from Spain arrived at the park.\n\nCronin opened Monkey World on 7 August 1987, providing the public with a rare opportunity to observe exotic primates. He made the sanctuary a rescue centre and not a zoo. The female chimpanzees were put on birth control to save space for more individuals needing rescuing. Monkey World did not only rescue Spanish beach chimps, but chimps from a variety of circumstances such as exotic pets, circus entertainers and medical research laboratory subjects. In 1993, Cronin met Alison Ames, an authority on animal behaviour and Cambridge graduate in biological anthropology. She and Cronin were married in 1996, from then on running Monkey World as a combined venture.\n\nCronin could hardly believe that his small refuge centre had grown into a thriving rescue centre for primates from around the world. Monkey World worked with the Ping Tung Rescue Centre in Taiwan in stopping the illegal smuggling of apes from the wild, and Monkey World was able to re-home some of the primates from the Ping Tung Rescue Centre, including Bornean orang-utans and different species of gibbon. Monkey World started working with foreign governments in the prevention of primate smuggling for pet trades, including the pet trade in Britain which allowed citizens to keep exotic small monkeys without being able to care for them properly or meet their substantial needs. Cronin and Alison travelled to places around the world, investigating animal trades, especially the trade and exploitation of primates.\n\nCronin's sanctuary had successfully recruited a number of Primate Care Staff who see that the day-to-day requirements of the primates are met. Veterinary consultants were brought in to help treat the animals and Adoption Schemes were set up to allow the park to continue its rescue and rehabilitation work. The biggest rescue the centre undertook was that of the 19 retired stump-tailed macaques from a medical research laboratory in the UK; but the rescue mission in 2008, of the 88 capuchin monkeys from a medical research laboratory in Chile, took the record of the largest rescue of primates in the world.\n\nIn 2006, Cronin was awarded an MBE by Queen Elizabeth II for services to animal welfare he was accompanied by Robert Pitts. Cronin has also received the Jane Goodall Award.\n\nThe television series \"Monkey Business\" (made by Meridian Broadcasting and shown on ITV Meridian in the UK and on Animal Planet worldwide) has documented the Cronin's frequent rescue missions and undercover investigations throughout Europe and Asia for the past 10 years. Beginning in 2007, \"Monkey Business\" was replaced with \"Monkey Life\", which also documents the goings-on within Monkey World.\nFollowing a brief battle with liver cancer, Cronin died on 17 March 2007 at the Cabrini Medical Center, Manhattan, New York. He was survived by his daughter Eleanor, from his first marriage, and his wife Alison Cronin. Since his death, Monkey World has been run by Alison and his close friend Jeremy Keeling.\n\nThe Jim Cronin Memorial Fund for Primate Welfare and Conservation was set up for the purpose of continuing Cronin's legacy and for the support of primate conservation and welfare all over the world. It is a UK-registered charity, number 1126939, and is sponsored by Monkey World.\n\n"}

In the English translation of the Roman Missal used from 1973 to 2011, it was called the Penitential Rite.\n\nA \"Brief Order of Confession\" sometimes takes place at the start of Lutheran Divine Service, and may include an Absolution, giving it sacramental weight.\n\nIn the Order of Mass of the Roman Rite, which is the most widespread liturgical rite in the Catholic Church, the introductory part of Mass normally includes a Penitential Act after the making of the sign of the cross and the priest's greeting. The Roman Missal provides three forms. The priest begins each with an exhortation to acknowledge one's sinfulness as preparation for celebrating the sacred mysteries and he ends it with the prayer, \"May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life\", a deprecatory absolution, as distinct from the declarative or indicative absolution, \"I absolve you from your sins\". Between these two interventions by the priest, sinfulness is acknowledged in one of three ways;\n\nThe Penitential Act is followed by the \"Kyrie eleison\" chant (unless the third form of the Penitential Act has been chosen) and on solemnities and feasts by the Gloria.\n\nIf certain celebrations are combined with Mass, then the Penitential Act and other parts of the Introductory Rites are omitted or performed in a different way. An example is the Mass of Ash Wednesday, in which the Penitential Act is replaced by the blessing and imposition of ashes after the homily.\n\n\"On Sundays, especially in the Season of Easter, in place of the customary Penitential Act, from time to time the Blessing and Sprinkling of Water to recall Baptism may take place.\"\n\nThe Tridentine Roman Missal (editions from 1570 to 1962), which does not use the term \"Penitential Act\", has an equivalent, within the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, in the \"Confiteor\":\n\nThe priest says:\n\nDeacon and subdeacon at a solemn Mass, server(s) at a low Mass, or server(s) and people at a dialogue Mass respond:\n\nThe \"Confiteor\" is then repeated by the others, replacing \"vobis fratres\" and \"vos fratres\" (you, brethren) with \"tibi pater\" and \"te pater\" (you, Father). The priest responds with the ' is spoken by the priest replacing ' with ', ' with ', and ' with \"\". The priest responds with two prayers: \"Misereátur vestri omnípotens Deus, et dimíssis peccátis vestris, perdúcat vos ad vitam ætérnam\" (May Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you your sins and bring you to everlasting life) and (making the sign of the cross) \"Indulgéntiam, absolutiónem, et remissiónem peccatórum nostrórum, tríbuat nobis omnípotens et miséricors Dóminus\" (May the Almighty and Merciful Lord grant us pardon, absolution, and remission of our sins). \n\nIn the original Tridentine Roman Missal (1570), the \"Misereatur\" prayer added the adjective \"omnibus\" (\"all\") to the phrase \"dimissis peccatis tuis/vestris\" (\"forgive you [all] your sins\").\n\nMartin Luther saw of private confession before receiving the Eucharist as coercive, but instead urged his followers to confess privately when particularly troubled. In lieu of private, individual confession, many forms of Lutheran Divine Service begin with a brief order of confession. The pastor and congregation say a Confiteor and the pastor may make a Declaration of Grace or an Absolution. If an absolution is spoken, the brief order of confession is understood to be sacramental. However, if private, individual confession is a common practice in a congregation, the brief order of confession may always be omitted.\n\nAs in the Roman Rite, a Thanksgiving for Baptism (similar to the Blessing and Sprinkling of Water) may replace the brief order of confession.\n\nBelow is an example, taken from the Lutheran Service Book, Divine Service Setting I\n"}

Taliferro Sports and Entertainment Complex along with the Salem Civic Center and Salem Football Stadium, approximately southeast of downtown. Opened on , it is home to the Single-A Advanced Salem Red Sox of the Carolina League (CL) and can seat 6,300 people. It was built in 1995 at a cost of $10.1 million to replace Municipal Stadium, it offers an impressive view of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nIn 1993, ownership of the then Salem Buccaneers were looking to sell the franchise. As the existing Municipal Stadium was not adequate to meet the needs of the franchise, Salem leaders looked at options to construct a new stadium in an effort to keep the franchise from relocating. In January 1994, Salem leaders approached both the City of Roanoke and Roanoke County in an effort to develop a regional partnership to construct a stadium. In March 1994, the Salem City Council decided a nonbinding referendum would be held later that summer to let the city residents decide if a new facility should be constructed. On July 19, Salem voters voted in favor of constructing a new ballpark with 2,236 people voting for and 398 voting against the proposal. With its citizens strongly supporting its construction, the Salem City Council voted unanimously on July 25 to approve construction of a new stadium.\n\nIn August, final designs were unveiled by Kinsey Shane & Associates, with J.M. Turner & Company selected as general contractor for construction of the $5 million ballpark. Its construction was to occur on property already under the ownership of the city adjacent to both the Salem Civic Center and Salem Football Stadium. The playing field was to be set first followed by the construction of the physical stadium with precast concrete. The facility was tentatively scheduled for completion for the start of the 1995 season. As a result of its construction, in September, ownership signed an agreement with the Colorado Rockies to serve as their Single A team beginning in 1995. The choice was made in large part based on the construction of the new stadium.\n\nAlthough budgeted to be completed for $5 million, in November Salem approved an additional $1 million to be spent on stadium construction. The following April, costs again rose to $10.1 million for its completion primarily as a result of low construction estimates. Slated to open for the start of the 1995 season, its opening was pushed back to May 22 then to June 20 and July 25 due to construction delays. On August 7, the stadium opened before a standing-room only crowd of 6,421 with the Avalanche defeating the Frederick Keys 3–2 in 15 innings.\n\nThe venue hosted the 2003 and 2004 Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournaments, won by Georgia Tech and Florida State, respectively.\n\nThe capacity was reduced from 6,300 to 4,968 for the 2009 season when the new Red Sox ownership decided to place tarps over four sections of the general admission seats in an effort to create a more \"intimate\" fan experience. Due to increased attendance, two of the four tarps were removed towards the end of the 2010 season to expand the stadiums' capacity to 5,503.\n\nOn March 3, 2005, Salem Avalanche officials announced that Salem Memorial Baseball Stadium was selected to play host to the 2006 Carolina-California League All-Star Game. Before a crowd of 5,133, and live television and radio audiences, the team of Carolina League All-Stars defeated the team of California League All-Stars by a score of 6-3. Chad Reineke (Carolina – Salem Avalanche) was the winning pitcher, Rodrigo Escobar (Carolina – Salem Avalanche) earned a save, and José Arredondo (California – Rancho Cucamonga Quakes) was the losing pitcher. Both teams awarded a \"Top Star,\" with each earning a place in the XM Satellite Radio All-Star Futures Game at the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The selection from the Carolina League was Nolan Reimold (Frederick Keys), and Reid Brignac (Visalia Oaks) was selected from the California League. Justin Hedrick (California – San Jose Giants) was named Pitcher of the Game.\n\nSalem also hosted the 2017 All-Star Game, which featured a skills competition at Salem's old ballpark as part of a celebration of Salem's 50th anniversary in the Carolina League. The Northern Division All-Stars defeated the Southern Division All-Stars 2-0. Salem third baseman Michael Chavis, whose two-run double in the first inning scored the only runs of the night, received the MVP Award.\n\nSalem Memorial Ballpark has been the setting for three no-hit games since its opening in 1995. The first took place on August 4, 1996, when Luther Hackman pitched a 4–1 no-hit game against the Kinston Indians. The second took place on April 10, 1997, when Scott Randall and Lariel González, combined to pitch a 1–0 no-hit game against the Wilmington Blue Rocks. The third took place on June 30, 2010, when Nathan Moreau of the Frederick Keys pitched a 7–0 no-hit game against the Red Sox.\n\nIn addition to serving as a second home field for the Roanoke College baseball team since 2002, Salem Memorial Ballpark has hosted several collegiate tournaments since 1996. In July 1994, city officials announced that the NCAA Division III (D-III) Baseball Championship would be played at the then proposed stadium for five years between 1995 and 1999. Although scheduled to be played in the new ballpark, in April 1995 city officials announced the D-III Baseball Championship would be moved to nearby Municipal Field as a result of construction delays on the new facility. Due to sagging attendance, in 1998 the NCAA announced the D-III Baseball Championship would be moved to Fox Cities Stadium outside Appleton, Wisconsin beginning with the 2000 tournament.\n\nIn December 2001, the City of Salem was notified of their successful bid against both Durham Bulls Athletic Park in Durham and L. P. Frans Stadium in Hickory to host both the 2003 and 2004 ACC Baseball Tournaments. The 2003 tournament saw 18,276 attend the event with Georgia Tech defeating NC State by a score of 6-5. The 2004 tournament saw 23,092 attend the event with Florida State defeating Georgia Tech, 17-5.\n\nSeating at the ballpark includes fixed stadium seats and ten luxury boxes located above the main concourse behind home plate. As of 2011, fixed seating capacity is 5,503. Games can be watched from one of two picnic areas — one on the third base line and one on the first base line.\n\nThe stadium features four concession stands, numerous other carts, and eight large restrooms. Lines are usually not a problem even with large crowds. There is ample free parking on site which is easily accessed from U.S. 11, U.S. 460, Virginia 419, and Interstate 81. In part because of promotions, the Salem minor league baseball teams have been more successful in building and maintaining attendance than Roanoke Valley's other minor league sports teams.\n\nIn May 1995, the Salem City Council unanimously voted to name the ballpark Salem Memorial Ballpark in honor of Salem's veterans. The name was the suggestion of then mayor Jim Taliaferro, with the American Legion donating $5,500 for the memorial dedicated inside the stadium. In 2006, the naming rights of the stadium were sold to the Salem-based LewisGale Regional Health System, which retained them for eleven seasons. In 2017, naming rights were acquired by Haley Toyota of Roanoke.\n\n"}

{"id": "2269053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269053", "title": "La Révolution surréaliste", "text": "La Révolution surréaliste\n\nLa Révolution surréaliste (English: \"The Surrealist Revolution\") was a publication by the Surrealists in Paris. Twelve issues were published between 1924 and 1929.\n\nShortly after releasing the first \"Surrealist Manifesto\", André Breton published the inaugural issue of \"La Révolution surréaliste\" on December 1, 1924.\n\nPierre Naville and Benjamin Péret were the initial directors of the publication and modeled the format of the journal on the conservative scientific review \"La Nature.\" The format was deceiving, and to the Surrealists' delight, \"La Révolution surréaliste\" was consistently scandalous and revolutionary. The journal focused on writing with most pages densely packed with columns of text, but also included reproductions of art, among them works by Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, André Masson and Man Ray.\n\nIssue 1 (December 1924): The cover of the initial issue announced the revolutionary agenda of \"La Révolution surréaliste\" with, \"It is necessary to start work on a new declaration of the rights of man.\"\n\nIn a mock scientific fashion the journal explored issues related to the darker sides of the human psyche with articles focused on violence, death and suicide. Detached descriptions of violent crime taken from police reports, and an impartial survey on suicide were included.\n\nIssue 3 (April 1925): The cover of the third issue announced, \"End of the Christian Era.\" Inside articles convey a blasphemous and anticlerical tone. Writer and actor Antonin Artaud wrote an open letter, \"Address to the Pope,\" and expresses the revolt against what Surrealists saw as oppressive religious values: \"The world is the soul's abyss, warped Pope, Pope foreign to the soul. Let us swim in our own bodies, leave our souls within our souls; we have no need of your knife-blade of enlightenment.\" Such anticlerical remarks are found throughout and reflect the group's relentless campaign against oppression and bourgeois morality.\n\nIssue 4: Breton announced in the fourth issue that he was taking over the publication. His concern about disruptive factions that had developed in the Surrealist group brought him to assert his power and restate the Surrealist principles as he conceived them.\n\nThereafter, each issue became more political with articles and declarations that have a Communist slant.\n\nIssue 8 (December 1926): The growing fascination with sexual perversion is revealed in an article by Paul Éluard which celebrates the writings of the Marquis de Sade, who was imprisoned for much of his life because of his deviant writings about sexual cruelty. According to Éluard, the Marquis \"wished to give back to civilized man the strength of his primitive instincts.\" Writing and imagery, influenced by de Sade, by Breton, Man Ray, and Salvador Dalí was also included.\n\nIssues 9 and 10 (October 1927): Introduce Exquisite corpse (Le Cadavre exquis)—a game the Surrealists enjoyed that involves folding a sheet of paper so that several people contribute to the drawing of a figure or writing text without seeing the preceding portions. The issue includes some exquisite corpse results.\n\nIssue 11 (): The interest in sex continues in the eleventh issue with \"Research into Sexuality,\" an account of a debate that took place in January 1928. In the frank discussion, more than a dozen Surrealists openly expressed their opinions on sexual matters, including a variety of perversions.\n\nIssue 12 (December 1929): Contains Breton's \"Second Surrealist Manifesto\". The declaration marks the end of the group's most cohesive and focused years, and signals the start of disagreements within the group. Breton celebrated his faithful supporters, and denounced those who had defected and betrayed his doctrine. Also contains the full script of \"Un Chien Andalou\" with Luis Buñuel's preface.\n\nSome of the dissidents voiced their views in the periodical \"Documents\" beginning in April 1929. Writings by ethnographers, archaeologists, and art historians, and poets Georges Bataille and Michel Leiris emerged as the main contributors. Some of the \"Documents\" contributors went later formed another group, Acéphale.\n\nBreton's successor to \"La Révolution surréaliste\" was a more politically engaged publication, \"Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution (Surrealism in the service of the revolution),\" which appeared sporadically between 1930 and 1933.\n\nIn 1933, publisher Albert Skira contacted Breton about a new journal, which he planned to be the most luxurious art and literary review the Surrealists had seen, featuring a slick format with many color illustrations. Skira's restriction was that Breton was not allowed to use the magazine to express his social and political views. Later that year \"Minotaure\" began publication, and continued publication until 1939.\n\n\n"}

The baseball stadium was built in conjunction with an adjacent 6,000-person football stadium. The New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers played in the inaugural game at City Stadium on April 11, 1940 in front of an estimated crowd of 7,000. The following professional baseball teams have all fielded affiliates of their parent club in Lynchburg: the Washington Senators, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago White Sox, Minnesota Twins, Texas Rangers, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, and Atlanta Braves. The stadium is currently home to the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Carolina League. The Hillcats are the Class A Affiliate of the Cleveland Indians beginning in 2015. From 2010–2014 they were affiliated with the Atlanta Braves. In 2005, the Hillcats set an attendance record with a total of 151,266 fans passing through the gates.\n\nCity Stadium opened in 1940. It was renovated and the field was renamed Calvin Falwell Field at City Stadium in 2004. In March 2020, the name was changed to Bank of James Stadium when the city entered into a six-year naming rights deal worth $50,000 annually with Bank of the James, proceeds to be equally split between the city and the team.\n\nThe stadium has had many major renovations since its inception in 1939. The first major renovation occurred in 1978. The renovation included reconstructing the outfield fence, grandstand roof, grandstand screen and adding new lights. In 1981, a clubhouse was added to accommodate both the football and baseball stadiums. In 2002 plans began for a $6.5 million renovation to Lynchburg City Stadium. The renovation included a complete renovation of the concourse with the addition of seat back chairs, and two picnic areas. The renovation also included the addition of two new concession stands, eight luxury boxes, a new press box, arcade room, spacious bathrooms and a state-of-the-art scoreboard. Prior to the 2005 season, six new luxury boxes were added in addition to a video board in right field. In August 2004, the field was dedicated to Calvin F. Falwell, President of the Lynchburg Baseball Corporation since its inception in 1966.\n\n"}

He is founder and chairman of Crescent Investment Management Ltd, a New York and London-based investment firm that operates \"CARAT\", a proprietary trading system developed by Ijaz in the late 1980s. His venture investments included unsuccessful efforts in 2013 to acquire a stake in Lotus F1, a Formula One team. In the 1990s, Ijaz and his companies were contributors to Democratic Party institutions as well as the presidential candidacies of Bill Clinton.\n\nDuring the first Clinton term, when the U.S. had severed official ties with Sudan, Ijaz opened informal communications links between Washington and Khartoum in an effort to gain access to Sudanese intelligence data on Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, who were then operating from Sudan. Ijaz was involved in efforts to broker a ceasefire in Kashmir in 2000–2001, and in the Memogate controversy, in which former Pakistani envoy Husain Haqqani allegedly used him to deliver a memorandum to senior U.S. officials in order to thwart an attempted coup by the Pakistani military after bin Laden was killed.\n\nMansoor Ijaz was born in Tallahassee, Florida, and grew up on a farm in Montgomery County, Virginia. He has two brothers (Atif and Mujeeb) and a sister (Neelam Ijaz-Ahmad). His brother Farouk died in 2012.\n\nHis father, Dr. Mujaddid Ahmed Ijaz (June 12, 1937— July 9, 1992), was a Pakistani experimental physicist and professor of physics at Virginia Tech who was noted for his early role in the development of Pakistan's nuclear energy program and his discovery of numerous isotopes while working at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. His mother, Dr. Lubna Razia Ijaz, was a solar physicist who worked with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization to develop renewable energy programs in Pakistan.\n\nIjaz received his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Virginia in 1983 and a master's degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985, where he was trained as a neural sciences engineer in the Harvard-MIT Medical Engineering Medical Physics Program (M.E.M.P.).\n\nWhile attending the University of Virginia, Ijaz earned All-American status as a powerlifter in March 1982 with a combined lift total (squat, bench press and deadlift) of 960 lbs at the National Collegiate Powerlifting Championships held at Marshall University. Coached by John Gamble, he competed in the 56 kg class. Later that year, he competed at the U.S. National Powerlifting Championships in the 52 kg class and finished third. Ijaz was Virginia State Champion in the 52 kg and 56 kg classes and set more than 25 Virginia State powerlifting records during three years in the sport.\n\nMansoor Ijaz began his career on Wall Street in 1986, joining Van Eck Associates Corporation as a technology analyst. In 1990, Ijaz left Van Eck to start Crescent Investment Management LLC, where he developed a trading system, Computer-Aided Regression Analysis Techniques, to manage his first hedge fund. His mentor at Van Eck, Klaus Buescher, joined Crescent as president in 1991, and they together managed the company until Buescher's death in June 1997. Since that time, Ijaz has remained active as Crescent's owner, operating it as a quantitative investment adviser and venture investing firm.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Crescent transitioned from a traditional hedge-fund management firm to a focus on venture investments, initially in homeland security technologies after the September 11 attacks. Ijaz formed and listed Crescent Technology Ventures PLC on London's AIM Stock Exchange to raise venture capital for his projects, but changes in AIM Rules for small-cap investment companies forced the start-up to de-list a year later. In the 2000s, Ijaz also launched an effort to finance and build what would have been the world's first underwater hotel, Hydropolis. Construction of this Dubai resort was projected to cost US$500 million in 2007, but was shelved by local authorities after the financial crisis of 2008. Crescent Hydropolis Holdings LLC continues operations today under private ownership.\n\nCrescent's venture investments included a bid together with its Abu Dhabi affiliate, Al Manhal International Group LLC, to acquire a stake in Formula One team Lotus F1. Quantum Motorsports Limited, a partnership between Crescent and Al Manhal, announced its intention to acquire 35% of Lotus F1 in June 2013. After several delays related to financing the deal, it did not take place.\n\nIjaz has also served as a media commentator and has written numerous opinion pieces for internationally known publications including \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Washington Post\", and the \"Los Angeles Times\" in the United States and the \"Financial Times\" in the United Kingdom. On television, he has served as a guest commentator for U.S. networks CNN, ABC, and Fox News, as well as for the BBC in the United Kingdom. Hired as a Fox News contributor in late 2001, Ijaz appeared as a counterterrorism and foreign affairs analyst on various network programming. By 2007, his appearances on Fox were no longer exclusive to the network. He continued to appear periodically for various networks in Pakistan, India and the U.S. into early 2012 as Pakistan's Supreme Court-appointed Judicial Commission began the Memogate inquiry.\n\nThrough his opinion pieces and political fundraising, Ijaz has advocated for the integration of Muslims into the American political mainstream. He raised significant amounts for various Democratic Party causes during the 1990s when President Clinton had paved the way for minority communities to become more active in U.S. politics, encouraging fellow Pakistani and Muslim Americans to join his fundraising efforts along the way. In 1996, Ijaz raised or contributed more than $525,000 for the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, bringing Ijaz into close proximity with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Clinton as well as other Clinton administration national security officials with whom he would later engage on Sudan, Kashmir and Pakistan's nuclear program.\n\nIjaz also used his fundraising results to advance his causes in Congress, appearing as an expert witness in front of committees in the Senate on extremist threats faced by the United States and in the House of Representatives to advocate for Washington to adopt a policy of \"\"constructive engagement\"\" with rogue Muslim countries affected by U.S. sanctions. As Ijaz' prominence in Democratic Party circles increased, allegations of conflicts with his business interests also surfaced, although they were never proven. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Ijaz had a public falling out with senior Clinton-era officials, including the former president, Sandy Berger and Susan Rice, over what he deemed were failures in their counterterrorism policies during Clinton's two terms in office. In 2007, Nevada Republicans approached Ijaz to run against Sen. Harry Reid, in a bid to unseat the Senate Majority Leader, but Ijaz declined.\n\nIjaz was a member of the board of directors of the Atlantic Council from 2007 until 2009, and he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,\n\nAway from Crescent's daily affairs and former political and media engagements, Ijaz has served on the College Foundation Board of Trustees at the University of Virginia, and he serves on the advisory board of the Rebuilding Afghanistan Foundation. RAF raises funds for building education infrastructure and programs in Afghanistan, including the construction of schools such as Mayar Elementary School, which enrolled 400 boys and girls from Maidan Wardak Province upon opening in late 2005. During the mid-1990s, Ijaz supported Developments in Literacy, an initiative to build and operate elementary schools in rural Pakistan as alternatives to the religious schools in which many Pakistani children were being radicalized. The group did not seek to create a secularized school system; its goal was to teach the Qur'an as one of many subjects rather than as the only subject. Ijaz and his wife Valérie also serve as goodwill ambassadors for a British charity, Children of Peace, that works to reconcile differences between Palestinian and Israeli youth. In late 2011, while addressing the World Peace Festival, a peace conference held in Berlin, Ijaz announced an intention to donate 1% of his net worth to create a Humanitarian Relief Fund that would make an effort to alleviate the root causes of poverty. In noting his belief that governments have often failed to provide assistance to the poor in sufficient ways over the long term, Ijaz sought similar pledges for the proposed fund from other philanthropists.\n\nMansoor Ijaz was involved in unofficial negotiations between the U.S. and Sudanese governments in 1996 and 1997 to obtain access to Sudan's intelligence files on Osama bin Laden and the early remnants of Al-Qaeda's network there after efforts to extradite bin Laden to the U.S. failed in early 1996. In the same year, the United States Congress imposed sanctions against Khartoum over allegations of harboring and abetting terrorist cells on its soil. In early 1996, CIA and State Department officials held secret meetings near Washington, D.C., with Sudan's then-defense minister, El Fatih Erwa. In May 1996, bin Laden left Sudan for Afghanistan under pressure from the United States when the meetings failed to reconcile U.S. demands made of Khartoum about its record in aiding, abetting and harboring known terrorist groups and individuals.\n\nIjaz first met Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir and other Sudanese leaders in August 1996 and reported his findings back to U.S. government officials, including Lee Hamilton, ranking member of the House Committee on International Relations at the time, and Sandy Berger, then Clinton's deputy national security adviser, and Susan Rice, then director for African Affairs at the National Security Council. Initially, Khartoum sought U.S. sanctions relief, particularly for its growing oil sector, in return for access to its intelligence data on Al Qaeda's nascent network and bin Laden's activities there. However, the sanctions continued until U.S. officials exempted some in unrelated policy decisions that benefited U.S. oil companies. Ijaz then argued that Washington should adopt a policy of \"constructive engagement\" with Khartoum vis-a-vis economic development and political reconciliation in return for Sudanese counterterrorism cooperation.\n\nIn April 1997, Omar al-Bashir to Hamilton, hand-carried by Ijaz from Khartoum to Washington D.C., in which Sudan made an unconditional offer of counterterrorism assistance to the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies. Madeleine Albright, then newly appointed Secretary of State, decided to test the Sudanese government's moderating public stance, and on September 28, 1997 she announced that certain U.S. diplomats would return to Khartoum to pursue, among other objectives, obtaining Sudan's counterterrorism data. According to former U.S. Ambassador to Sudan Tim Carney and Ijaz, Susan Rice, then newly appointed as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, and counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke persuaded Berger to overrule Albright's overture to Khartoum. In early October 1997, the State Department abruptly reversed its diplomatic entendre and proceeded in early November to announce new, more comprehensive trade, economic, and financial sector sanctions against the Sudanese regime. Ijaz ended his efforts to reconcile U.S.–Sudan relations over counterterrorism issues in the summer of 1998 after the FBI declined Sudanese intelligence chief Gutbi Al-Mahdi's final unconditional offer of counterterrorism cooperation.\n\nCapturing bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton until his death in 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.\n\nHowever, the 9/11 Commission found that although \"\"former Sudanese officials claim that Sudan offered to expel bin Laden to the United States\", \"... we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim.\"\" Amb. Carney reportedly had instructions only to press the Sudanese to expel bin Laden because the U.S. government had no legal basis (i.e., no indictment outstanding) to ask the Sudanese for further action. In August 1998, two years after the warnings, the U.S. launched cruise missile strikes against Khartoum in retaliation for the East Africa embassy bombings.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, Ijaz was involved in efforts to broker a ceasefire in Kashmir, the cause of multiple wars between India and Pakistan since independence. He held a series of meetings with senior Indian and Pakistani government officials as well as senior Kashmiri leaders in both Indian and Pakistani-held Kashmir from November 1999 until January 2001, traveling to India secretly on out-of-passport visas. Following months of clandestine negotiations between militant Kashmiri commander Abdul Majid Dar and A. S. Dulat, then-chief of India's intelligence directorate, Dar declared a unilateral ceasefire in the Himalayan enclave on July 25, 2000. The initial ceasefire was aborted by a hard-line militant faction within Dar's Hizbul Mujahideen, widely believed to have been supported by Pakistani intelligence. In order to gain Pakistani support for India's peace efforts in Kashmir, Ijaz met Gen. Pervez Musharraf in Islamabad in May 2000. Musharraf reluctantly agreed to back the ceasefire plan despite opposition from hardliners in the ranks of Pakistan's armed forces and intelligence services.\n\nIjaz carried Musharraf's message to senior Indian officials, including India's then-deputy intelligence chief, C. D. Sahay. Sahay and Ijaz worked together to develop a comprehensive blueprint for participation of a wider cross-section of Kashmiri resistance groups, particularly militant groups operating from Pakistan-held Kashmir. In late summer 2000, Ijaz traveled to Muzaffarabad to negotiate with Hizbul Mujahideen commander Syed Salahuddin. That meeting resulted in Salahuddin to President Clinton, hand-carried to the White House by Ijaz, in which the Kashmiri leader requested Clinton's support for Salahuddin's further steps in Kashmiri ceasefire negotiations.\n\nThe plan drafted by Sahay and Ijaz reportedly became the basis of a decision by India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to announce a unilateral ceasefire in Indian-held Kashmir in November 2000. To broaden support for the plan, Ijaz met with senior Indian government officials in New Delhi and leaders of Kashmiri resistance groups in Srinagar. He would later bring the two sides together for face-to-face negotiations. But Ijaz's efforts to build permanent peace ended in early 2001 when he shared his plans with Indian home minister L. K. Advani to bring Pakistan's radical Islamic groups on board in support of wider Indo-Pakistani peace. A resulting peace summit between India and Pakistan, held in Agra in June 2001, sought to forge an agreement on a permanent resolution to the Kashmir conflict, but Musharraf and Vajpayee ultimately failed to persuade their hardliners to allow signing of an accord.\n\nMansoor Ijaz was one of the key protagonists in Pakistan's \"Memogate\" controversy. On October 10, 2011 Ijaz published an opinion piece about the interference of Pakistan's intelligence services in the function of its democratic institutions. In the opinion's prelude, Ijaz disclosed the existence of a that he had allegedly been asked to deliver to Admiral Mike Mullen, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on behalf of a senior Pakistani diplomat, later identified as Pakistani envoy Husain Haqqani, in the days following the Abbottabad raid. The memorandum sought the Obama administration's help to avert a military takeover of Pakistan's civilian government in the immediate aftermath of Osama bin Laden's death. It was delivered to Mullen at Ijaz's request by former U.S. national security adviser General James L. Jones.\n\nThen-leader of the opposition, Nawaz Sharif (who would later become Pakistan's prime minister), lodged a petition with the Supreme Court of Pakistan to investigate the origins, credibility and purpose of the memorandum. His and other petitions lodged with the Supreme Court alleged that the memorandum had been drafted by Haqqani at the behest of Pakistan's then-president, Asif Ali Zardari, and delivered without knowledge of the country's powerful armed forces and intelligence services. On December 30, 2011, after reviewing Sharif's petition, the Supreme Court constituted a Judicial Commission to conduct a broad inquiry. Ijaz was among the , as were Pakistan's intelligence chief, Ahmad Shuja Pasha and Haqqani. Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani submitted written testimony to the Supreme Court, as did then-Prime Minister Yousef Raza Gilani on behalf of the Zardari government.\n\nAfter nearly six months of investigations, the Judicial Commission reported its findings on June 12, 2012. It found that the memorandum was authentic and that Haqqani was its \"originator and architect\". The report said the former ambassador \"orchestrated the possibility of an imminent coup to both persuade Mr. Ijaz to convey the message and also to give it (Memorandum) traction and credibility\". The justices found further that one of Haqqani's purposes was to head a new national security team in Pakistan. In an unexpected turn of the investigation, a secret fund was discovered in Pakistan's Washington embassy that Haqqani allegedly had access to and had allegedly utilized, in \"\"apparent violation of Article 84 of the Constitution of Pakistan\"\". The Commission's report exonerated President Zardari from any prior knowledge of the memorandum, although it noted that in the \"considered view\" of the justices, Haqqani had led Ijaz to believe the memorandum had the Pakistani president's approval. Following testimony by Ijaz, the Commission deemed him a reliable witness whose credibility Haqqani had unsuccessfully sought to undermine.\n\nThe Supreme Court, upon hearing the Commission's report in session, ordered Haqqani to appear before the bench. The former envoy, however, continued to reject the Commission's findings while maintaining his innocence. As of July 2014, he remained in the United States.\n\n"}

{"id": "2269070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269070", "title": "Simoom", "text": "Simoom\n\nSimoom ( \"samūm\"; from the root \"s-m-m\", \"to poison\") is a strong, dry, dust-laden wind. The word is generally used to describe a local wind that blows in the Sahara, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, and the deserts of Arabian Peninsula. Its temperature may exceed and the humidity may fall below 10%. \n\nAlternative spellings include samoon, samun, simoun, and simoon. Another name used for this wind is samiel (Turkish \"samyeli\" from Arabic \"sāmm سامّ\" meaning \"poisonous\" and Turkish \"yel\" meaning \"wind\"). Simoom winds have an alternative type occurring in the region of Central Asia known as \"Garmsil\" (гармсель).\n\nThe name means \"poison wind\" and is given because the sudden onset of simoom may also cause heat stroke. This is attributed to the fact that the hot wind brings more heat to the body than can be disposed of by the evaporation of perspiration.\n\n\"The Nuttall Encyclopædia\" described the simoom:\n\nThe storm moves in cyclone (circular) form, carrying clouds of dust and sand, and produces on humans and animals a suffocating effect.\n\nA 19th-century account of simoom in Egypt reads:\n\nEgypt is also subject, particularly during the spring and summer, to the hot wind called the \"samoom,\" which is still more oppressive than the khamasin winds, but of much shorter duration, seldom lasting longer than a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. It generally proceeds from the south-east or south-south-east, and carries with it clouds of dust and sand.\n\nIt has been alleged that a \"simoom\" occurred on June 17, 1859 in Goleta and Santa Barbara, California. Local historian Walker Tompkins wrote that:\n...during the morning, the temperature hovered around the normal , but around 1pm, strong super hot winds filled with dust began to blow from the direction of the Santa Ynez Mountains to the north. By 2 pm, the temperature supposedly reached . This temperature was said to have been recorded by an official U.S. coastal survey vessel that was operating in the waters just offshore, in the Santa Barbara Channel. At 5 pm, the temperature had reportedly dropped to , and by 7 pm, the temperature was back to a normal .\n\nTompkins provided a supposed quote from a U.S. government report saying, \"Calves, rabbits and cattle died on their feet. Fruit fell from trees to the ground scorched on the windward side; all vegetable gardens were ruined. A fisherman in a rowboat made it to the Goleta Sandspit with his face and arms blistered as if he had been exposed to a blast furnace.\" Also according to Tompkins, local inhabitants were saved from the heat by seeking shelter in the thick adobe walled houses that were the standard construction at the time.\n\nHowever, experts contest this account. UCSB Professor Joel Michaelsen, for instance, said: I have never found any outside source to validate Tompkins' story, and I am highly skeptical of its veracity. I don't doubt that strong hot, dry downslope winds could kick up lots of dust and produce very high temperatures – but in the 110 F – 115 F range at most. The 133 F just isn't physically reasonable, as it would require the creation of an extremely hot air mass somewhere to the northeast. Last Monday's weather was a very good strong example of the sort of conditions that would produce such a heat wave, and our temperatures topped out at least 20 degrees below Tompkins' figure. Stronger winds could have increased the heating a bit, but not nearly that much. Add to all that meteorologically-based skepticism Tompkins' well-known tendency to mix liberal doses of fiction into his 'histories,' and I think you have a strong case for discounting this one.\n\nMeteorologist Christopher C. Burt wrote about the alleged incident: \nThere is no record of who made this measurement or exactly where it was made in Santa Barbara. Some later sources say it was made on a U.S. coastal geo-survey vessel. If that is the case then the temperature is not possible since the waters off Santa Barbara in June are never warmer than about 70°F and any wind blowing over the ocean would have its temperature modified by the cool water no matter how hot the air. This report is singular and there is physical evidence (burnt crops and dead animals) that something amazing happened here this day, but the temperature record is impossible to validate.\"\n\nEdgar Allan Poe's short story \"MS. Found in a Bottle\" (1833) features a storm off the coast of Java, wherein \"every appearance warranted me [the protagonist-narrator] in apprehending a Simoom.\"\n\nIn the political essay \"Chartism\", Thomas Carlyle argues that even the poorest of men who have resigned themselves to misery and toil cannot resign themselves to injustice because they retain an innate sense that a higher (divine) justice must govern the world: \"Force itself, the hopelessness of resistance, has doubtless a composing effect against inanimate Simooms, and much other infliction of the like sort, we have found it suffice to produce complete composure. Yet one would say a permanent Injustice even from an Infinite Power would prove unendurable by men.\"\n\n\"Walden\" (1854), by Henry David Thoreau, references a simoom; he uses it to describe his urge to escape something most unwanted. \"There is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted. It is human, it is divine, carrion. If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life, as from that dry and parching wind of the African deserts called the simoom, which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated, for fear that I should get some of his good done to me – some of its virus mingled with my blood. No – in this case I would rather suffer evil the natural way.\"\n\nIn his 1854 novel \"Hard Times\", Charles Dickens in describing the oppressive midsummer heat of the sooty, smoky factories of Coketown, writes, \"The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom; and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled languidly in the desert\" (book 2, chapter 1). In \"American Notes\" Dickens also describes \"that injurious [political] Party Spirit\" as \"the Simoom of America, sickening and blighting everything of wholesome life within its reach.\" \n\nIn Bram Stoker's novel \"Dracula\" (1897), Lucy, describing the appearance of Dracula in her room, writes in her journal entry on September 17 that \"a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoom in the desert.\"\n\nIn James Joyce's novel \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (1914), there is a reference to \"Stephen's heart [withering] up like a flower of the desert that feels the simoom coming from afar.\"\n\nIn Sinclair Lewis' novel \"Main Street\" (1920), there is a reference to \"Aunt Bessie's simoom of questioning.\"\n\nIn keeping with its tradition of naming its aircraft engines after winds, the Wright Aeronautical R-1200 of 1925 was called the Simoon.\n\nA simoon strikes during chapter 2 of the film serial \"Tarzan the Tiger\" (1929).\n\nIn \"Making a President\" (1932), H. L. Mencken refers to \"a veritable simoon of hiccups.\"\n\nIn Patrick O'Brian's novel \"Post Captain\" (1972), Diana Villiers' mentally troubled cousin, Edward Lowndes, upon learning that Doctor Maturin is a naval surgeon, remarks, \"Very good – you are \"upon\" the sea but not \"in\" it: you are not an advocate for cold baths. The sea, the sea! Where should we be without it? Frizzled to a mere toast, sir; parched, desiccated by the simoom, the dread simoom.\"\nA song titled \"Simoon\" features on the Yellow Magic Orchestra's eponymously titled album that was released in 1978. The Creatures have a song called \"Simoom\" on their 1989 album \"Boomerang\", with lyrics such as \"Simoom, simoom... you breathe in suffocation / Relentless simoom, blow and whistle this tune\".\n\nIn the film \"The English Patient\" (1996) there is a scene in which Count László Almásy regales Katharine Clifton with histories of named winds, one of them being the \"Simoon.\" Alluding to the records of Herodotus, Almásy tells Katharine that there was once a certain Arabic people who deemed the \"Simoon\" so evil that they marched out to meet it ranked as an army, \"their swords raised.\"\n\nIn the collectible card game , card named \"Simoon\" first appeared in the Visions expansion set on a fictional continent of Jamuraa. This card saw play in the sideboard of contemporary Type II decks and was especially effective against the popular Five Colours Green decks that heavily relied on small creatures with toughness of 1.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the Potomac Nationals minor league baseball team who plan to move out in 2020. It was built in 1984. The stadium is located near the McCoart Government Center, the offices of the Prince William County Service Authority and the Sean Connaughton Community Plaza. It holds 6,000 people.\n\nAfter the 2011 season, the field was redone to upgrade it to MLB specifications, as the previous field failed to meet those standards. This was done due to moving a series because of unsafe conditions.\n\nIn December 2016 reports emerged of a possible new Potomac Nationals stadium. Two County Supervisors said that team owner Art Silber told them Minor League Baseball is requiring the team to be out of Pfitzner Stadium by the end of the 2018 season.\n\nA one-alarm fire caused by an inside gas leak destroyed the facility's business offices on June 29, 2012. There were no fatalities or injuries. Other parts of the stadium, including the concession stands one level below the offices, were not damaged. The fire put the Nationals' mascot Uncle Slam out of action for the remainder of the Carolina League season.\n\nThe fences at Pfitzner Stadium are 315 feet down the lines and 400 feet to straight-away center field. There is an electronic scoreboard in left-center field capable of displaying images as well as some video. The dugouts at the stadium are unusual in that they are located at field level, and prior to 2018 there was no fence or rail separating them from the field. However, as part of renovations completed following the 2017 season, netting was added in front of both the home and visiting dugouts.\n\nThe stadium was originally known as G. Richard Pfitzner Stadium. On May 3, 2018, the Potomac Nationals announced that as part of a sponsorship deal with Northwest Federal Credit Union, the stadium would be renamed Northwest Federal Field at Pfitzner Stadium. The naming rights deal also includes the stadium's field tarp and bullpen picnic area.\n\nThe Potomac Nationals, playing at Pfitzner Stadium since 1984, began seeking a better ballpark at least as early as 1998, with various proposals made in 2000, 2002, 2005, 2010, 2011, and 2016. In June 2018, Potomac Nationals owner Art Silber announced that he had signed a letter of intent to build a new stadium in Fredericksburg, Virginia that would open in April 2020, though the deal actually calls for the facility to be ready for public events by April 1, 2021. The Potomac Nationals played their last regular season game at Pfitzner Stadium on August 29, 2019.\n\n"}

Located near the Gulf of Mexico, Baffin Bay forms part of the boundary between Kenedy County and Kleberg County.\n\nThe history of the bay name is unclear. The most popular story is that Captain Mifflin Kenedy (1818–1895), after visiting the Arctic Baffin Bay as a young man, gave the same name to the bay in Texas because of the remarkable contrast between the bays. The Arctic Baffin Bay is located between the Baffin Island of Canada and Greenland, and it is about 310 times larger by area than the Baffin Bay in Texas.\n\nThe Baffin Bay has three branches, which are named as follows (counterclockwise on the map above): Alazan Bay on the north (green), Cayo del Grullo (purple) and Laguna Salada (blue). Several ephemeral streams, including San Fernando, Santa Gertrudis and Los Olmos, flow into the bay, but only when it rains. Because of the scarce freshwater inflow and extensive evaporation, which is promoted by shallow water and warm climate, the bay has a relatively high water salinity reaching 75‰ (parts per thousand) in its northern part. Between 1946 and 1948 and in 1968, the salinity level in the bay exceeded 100‰ killing much fish in the area.\n\nAbout 21 km of the bottom of the bay is covered in seagrass; most other parts are dominated by shoal grass (\"Halodule beaudettei\") with occasional rocky outcrops. Scattered parts of the bay, mostly near the mouth, contain the relict serpulid worm reefs, which are composed of the remains of serpulid tube worms. Although some tube worm species still inhabit the bay area and the reefs, they bring no significant contribution to the reef structure. Most reefs are circular or ellipsoid structures between 8 and 40 meters (26 to 131 ft) in diameter and 0.5 to 2 meters (1.5–6.6 ft) in height above the sediment. Their total area is about 16 km (6 mi), but it is gradually reducing due to erosion.\n\nThe climate has been described as semiarid, subhumid or subtropical, with a very varying precipitation. Tropical storms and hurricanes are common, and they strongly alter the climate and hydrology of the region.\n\nThe lands around the bay are flat and dominated by grasslands and oak savanna; they are used for agriculture and cattle farming. Common tree and plant species include southern live oak (\"Quercus virginiana\"), prickly pear (\"Opuntia\" spp.), lime prickly-ash (\"Zanthoxylum fagara\"), greenbriar (\"Smilax\" spp.), sunflowers (\"Helianthus\" spp.), tanglehead (\"Heteropogon contortus\"), crinkleawn (\"Trachypogon spicatus\"), gulfdune paspalum (\"Paspalum monostachyum\"), fringed signalgrass (\"Urochloa ciliatissima\"), shrubby oxalis (\"Oxalis frutescens angustifolia\"), dayflower (\"Commelina\" spp.), Texas lantana (\"Lantana urticoides\"), Texas bullnettle (\"Cnidoscolus texanus\"), silverleaf nightshade (\"Solanum elaeagnifolium\"), crotons (\"Croton\" spp.) and Lindheimer tephrosia (\"Tephrosia lindheimeri\").\n\nThe waters of the bay contain several species of annelids and 29 species of diatoms. The dominant mollusks are dwarf surf clams and \"Capitella capitata\". The serpulid worm reefs are inhabited by crustaceans, polychaetes and mollusks. Invertebrates are represented by the endemic fiddler crab species \"Uca subcylindrica\", which reside on dry soil, more than 20 meters from bay waters. The bay is a popular destination for recreational angling and is famous for its trophy spotted seatrout. Other species include redfish, threadfin shad (in low salinity periods), pompano, black drum and burrowing goby, etc.\n\n\n"}

The park was originally known as Legends Stadium when it was built in 1993. It was renamed in 1994 for Wilmington mayor Daniel S. Frawley, who had pushed for a return of the Blue Rocks. The field is named separately for Judy Johnson, a local Negro league baseball star.\n\nThe stadium was designed by architect Trish England, head of Design Exchange, who had previously designed dozens of commercial buildings in Delaware. Construction began on November 1, 1992 and was headed by contractor Matthew Minker, a part owner of the team. The stadium site was once part of a Christina River shipbuilding operation. In 1986, the Dravo Shipyard, with several buildings, was bought by Verino Pettinaro, a local contractor, for a little more than $1 million. Mr. Pettinaro sold for the stadium to the Delaware Stadium Corporation for $300,000. The Delaware Stadium Corporation, a city and state entity, has owned the stadium since its construction.\n\n The stadium seats 6,404 people. The Blue Rocks have a picnic area in the stadium named the Blue Moose Grill and a gift shop, The Quarry.

Haas (February 26, 1929 – June 29, 2016) was an American auto racing impresario. He co-owned the Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing team in the Champ Car and IndyCar Series with Paul Newman and Mike Lanigan. He also owned Carl A. Haas Motorsports, which competed in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, as well as the Haas Lola Formula One team.\n\nHaas was born in Ludwigshafen am Rhein in Germany. He emigrated to the US in March 1938. He was of Jewish descent. His father fled Germany in the 1930's.\n\nHaas grew up in Chicago and sold gearbox parts from his parents' home. He used the proceeds to begin racing sports cars in 1952 and won numerous races driving Ferraris, Porsches, MGs, and Jaguars. He retired from driving in the early 1960s in order to focus more on team ownership and other racing-related businesses. In 1967, he became the exclusive American importer for Lola Cars and helped the company attain national prominence in the racing world. His own company, Carl A. Haas Auto Imports, was founded in Lincolnshire, Illinois in 1960, and is involved in racing distribution deals, notably for Hewland gearboxes.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Haas entered race teams in various series, including Formula 5000, the Can-Am Series and the Super Vee series. His Can-Am drivers included Masten Gregory, Peter Revson, Jackie Stewart, Brian Redman, Alan Jones, Patrick Tambay, Jacky Ickx, and David Hobbs. His Super Vee driver, Eddie Miller, won the series title. In 1985, he ran the Haas Lola Formula One team, using a chassis built by FORCE. He also co-owned a NASCAR Winston Cup Series team with Travis Carter for eight seasons.\n\nIn 1983, Haas joined with actor Paul Newman to form Newman/Haas Racing, a team in the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) Series. The team won its first CART title with Mario Andretti the next year, and the team went on to win three more series championships: Michael Andretti won in 1991, former Formula 1 World champion Nigel Mansell in 1993, and Brazilian Cristiano da Matta in 2002. Following the IRL-CART war and the subsequent bankruptcy of CART, Newman/Haas has won in the successor series to CART, the Champ Car World Series, with Sébastien Bourdais in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.\n\nDuring his years in CART, Haas became known for his fondness for cigars. Prohibited from smoking in the pitlane, he would chew an unlit cigar during the race, often at both ends. When Michael Andretti and Juan Montoya collided during a practice session for the 1999 race at Twin Ring Motegi, Japan, Haas infamously threw his cigar at Montoya's car owner Chip Ganassi during a confrontation in the garage area.\n\nOne of the few car owners ever to record victories in F5000, CART, Champcar and IRL, Haas also participated in race promotion. He served on CART's Board of Governors until it folded in 2003, and retired as chairman of the SCCA Pro Racing Division in 2001.

The stadium is all-seated. On opening, it had a capacity of 20,750 (now 21,088), making it the largest purpose-built venue in Swansea; minor layout changes have since increased this. It is the home stadium of EFL Championship club Swansea City, who took full operational control of the stadium in 2018, and the Ospreys rugby team. As a result of Swansea City's promotion, the stadium became the first Premier League ground in Wales. It is the third largest stadium in Wales – after Millennium Stadium and Cardiff City Stadium. In European competitions, the stadium is known as Swansea Stadium because of advertising rules.\n\nWith the Vetch Field, St Helen's and The Gnoll no longer being up-to-date venues to play at, and both the Swans and the Ospreys not having the necessary capital to invest into a new stadium, Swansea council and a developer-led consortia submitted a proposal for a sustainable 'bowl' venue for 20,520 seats on a site to the west of the River Tawe on the site of the Morfa Stadium, an athletics stadium owned by the City and County of Swansea council. It was funded by a 355,000 ft retail park on land to the east of the river. The final value of the development was in excess of £50m.\n\nOn 10 July 2005, Liberty Stadium was opened and became the home to Swansea City (replacing the Vetch Field) and the Ospreys (replacing St Helen's and The Gnoll). On 23 July 2005, Liberty Stadium was officially opened as Swansea City faced Fulham, (then managed by former Swansea player Chris Coleman) in a friendly match. The match ended in a 1–1 draw with the first goal being scored by Fulham's Steed Malbranque. Swansea's Marc Goodfellow scored during the game to level the match.\n\nBefore a league match between Swansea City and Oldham Athletic in October 2005, a statue of Ivor Allchurch was unveiled to commemorate the Swansea-born star who during two spells for the club scored a record 164 goals in 445 appearances.\n\nThe first capacity crowd recorded at Liberty Stadium was on the 1 November 2006 when The Ospreys beat Australia A 24–16. The stadium has hosted multiple Wales football internationals, listed below.\n\nSeating at Liberty Stadium is often sold out during Swansea City football matches. Swansea City have expressed a desire to have the capacity of the stadium increased and have held talks with Swansea Council during the 2011–2012 season for the future expansion of the Liberty Stadium which would be completed in a number of phases beginning with expansion or redevelopment of the east stand. Plans for a new McDonald's fast food restaurant to be opened near the stadium threw expansion plans into doubt. However, the planning application was withdrawn.\n\nIn December 2013, it was reported by \"BBC News\" that the European Commission had requested details of the funding of the stadium, as part of a wider inquiry into state aid for sports clubs.\n\nAt the start of the 2014–15 Premier League season, a number of changes were made to the stadium. These included two new 'Jumbotron' screens inside the north and south stands, measuring approximately 200 inches. Due to sponsorship by LG all televisions in food outlets and concourse were replaced by 50\" LG TV screens and the south stand renamed The LG Stand. New advertising boards with a crowd facing side were also added.\n\nExpansions planned would expand the stadium to 33,000, with another expansion upgrading the stadium to above the 40,000 mark. This would make Wales national football matches a possibility.\n\nDuring its construction, a variety of names were suggested for it: most commonly used was \"White Rock\" stadium (after the copper works of the same name which existed on the site historically). However \"White Rock\" was only used as a temporary name during its construction and when work was finished, the name was dropped and the stadium owners began looking for sponsors for the stadium. While sponsors were being searched for, it was called \"New Stadium Swansea\". On 18 October 2005, Swansea-based developers Liberty Properties Plc won the naming rights to call it \"Liberty Stadium\". In UEFA matches, it is called Swansea Stadium due to UEFA regulations on sponsorship. On 8 May 2015 the stadium was renamed The Katie Phillips Stadium for one night only.\n\nThe ground has also hosted seven Wales international football fixtures. The results were as follows.\n\nIn April 2014, the stadium held a UK Independence Party conference.\n\n\"Average attendances are for home league matches only.\"\n\n\n"}

He was the 'Chief servitor of the Aten in the temple of Aten in Akhetaten' and 'Second Prophet of the Lord of the Two Lands'. He was also the 'Seal-bearer of Lower Egypt'.\n\nPanehsy was also the 'Superintendent of the Cattle of the Aten in Akhetaten' and the 'Superintendent of the Granary of the Aten'.\n\nPanehesy had two houses in Amarna. One was located near the temple, while another was located in the Central City. The house near the temple was likely more of an office.\n\nThe main residence of Panehesy (R44.2) lies in the Central City of Amarna. In his main residence a large shrine was discovered which depicted Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and princess Meritaten making offerings to the Aten. This is an example of the domestic cult of the royal couple. The hypaethral chapel was located within the central hall. To the south of Panehesy's home was a small village. The total area occupied by the village is less than the area occupied by the main residence of the Priest. The village consists of some 40 houses that were likely the residences of Panehesy's staff.\nIn the vicinity of the home a stele was discovered depicting Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye.\n\nThe second residence of Panehesy near the temple of the Aten may be related to his function as the overseer of the cattle. The structure includes stone floors and brick mangers and may have served as a holding pen for the cattle. Excavations revealed remains of cattle, horn and bones. The bones were the remains of the cattle butchered for the offerings in the temple. The central hall of this house held a stone built shrine painted to look like an Amarna Temple. The structure held narrow wooden doors and likely held a statue of the King. The shrine is now at the Cairo Museum.\n\nHe had a tomb constructed at Amarna, among the northern tombs among the Tombs of the Nobles. The Tomb of Panehsy (Amarna Tomb 6) contains scenes of himself and his family and others showing the royal family, but his remains have never been identified. The tomb had suffered damage from iconoclasts. The images of Akhenaten and Nefertiti had been disfigured, and most of the names had been removed.\n\nIn later times, his tomb was turned into a Coptic place of worship for a while and suffered damage. \nA deep font for total immersion was placed before the apse.\n"}

Composed by founding members Steven Page and Ed Robertson, the sing-along track has become one of the band's best-known songs, and is a live show staple, despite never having been a true single and without an accompanying music video. The song reached No. 13 in Canada and eventually charted in the United Kingdom and the United States, peaking also at No. 13 on the UK Rock Chart in 1996, as well as No. 37 on the US \"Billboard\" Adult Top 40 in 2000.\n\nThe song first appeared on one of the later versions of the band's first independent release, \"Buck Naked\". The song subsequently appeared on their second and third tapes, \"Barenaked Lunch\", and \"The Yellow Tape\", as well as their 1991 EP \"\", and their debut CD, \"Gordon\", which would go on to sell over a million copies in Canada, where the song remains very popular and well known. An edited version of the \"Gordon\" recording of the song later appeared as a bonus track on the UK edition of \"Born on a Pirate Ship\" (this version was later released as a single), and a live version of it was featured on \"Rock Spectacle\". The \"Gordon\" version was then included on \"Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits\", bringing the total album count for the song to eight.\n\n\"If I Had $1000000\" gained popularity over the course of the band's early tours, before the release of their first album (\"Gordon\") and became highly requested on radio stations in Canada following the release of \"Gordon\". This prompted the band's label to release a one-track radio single of the song in December 1992. In 1993, the song would be officially released as a commercial single in the UK; a second commercial single was released there in 1996. Another radio single containing the \"Gordon\" and \"Rock Spectacle\" versions of the song was released in North America later. Despite these releases, the song is often not considered a true single, since it gained popularity before the release of a radio single, and it never had a music video (although stations such has MuchMoreMusic and MuchMoreRetro have occasionally aired a 1992 performance from \"Intimate and Interactive\" as a video).\n\n\"If I Had $1000000\" is one of the earliest-composed Barenaked Ladies songs. It was first conceived as a simple improvised song while Page and Robertson were counsellors at a summer music camp. On the way home from camp, Robertson played the tune for the campers, randomly listing amusing things he would buy with a million dollars. Upon returning to camp, he brought the idea to Page, and the two fleshed out the song. The song has become an icon of Canadian culture, reflecting sentiments on Canadians who wish to win a large lottery prize. In 2005, the song's popularity to people of all ages caused it to be placed at in the list of , aired on CBC Radio.\n\nWhile hinting at romantic intentions, the lyrics offer eccentric ideas about purchases one would make with a million dollars. The protagonist suggests all the things he would buy for his sweetheart were he a millionaire. Ed Robertson and Steven Page share the vocals: in the verses, it is a call-and-response vocal with Page responding to the lines Robertson starts; in the choruses, Robertson and the rest of the band repeat the harmonized title line while Page responds to the line with further spending ideas.\n\nA trademark of the song developed early on: After each of the first two choruses of the song, the vocals break down into a free-form banter. On each of the song's first three indie cassette appearances (\"Buck Naked\", the \"Pink Tape\" and the \"Yellow Tape\"), the banter between Page and Robertson lasts only in the remainder of the bar after the last line of the chorus. On \"Buck Naked\", the second banter is followed by an instrumental interlude.\n\nThe dialogues became improvisational for Page and Robertson at live shows. When it came time to record \"Gordon\", recognizing that spontaneity in these banters would be vital to the song, the band chose to record a different take of this song each day, with the best one chosen for the album. In live performances, it became traditional for Page and Robertson to improvise entirely new dialogue at these points. Initially the subject tended to flow from the previous sung lyric (a fridge in a treefort after the first chorus, and Kraft Dinner after the second chorus); with time this grew less common, and evolved into one of the two lead singers telling an unrelated anecdote. Since Page's departure from the band in February 2009, keyboardist Kevin Hearn has filled his singing role in concert and all of the remaining band members have picked up some of the bantering with Robertson.\n\nSome of the purchases are humorous references to the lavish spending of pop star Michael Jackson during the 1980s, specifically exotic animals, the remains of the \"Elephant Man\" and a pet monkey. For an awards ceremony, Jackson bought Elizabeth Taylor, his friend, a sparkling emerald green dress ('not real emeralds').\n\nThe line \"but not a real green dress that's cruel\" was originally written as \"with a tastefully rounded neck\". Page incorrectly sang the \"cruel\" lyric in the studio as a joke, which Robertson found so funny that the rest of the band decided to leave it in the finished song.\n\nA line in the song inspired fans to begin throwing Kraft Dinner at the band during concerts. It initially began as a single box at a 1991 show at the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto. It quickly grew by word-of-mouth, and the number of boxes being thrown rapidly increased. It became so bad that eventually hundreds of boxes were pelted at shows; the band and their instruments were often the target. Especially unpleasant were open cheese packages, which would create a putrid aroma when sitting on stage under hot spotlights. Some diehard fans would go one step further and throw cooked pasta. Eventually, the band requested that fans cease the ritual and instead donate the food via bins set up in the lobbies of their shows for local food banks.\n\nIn the band's \"iTunes Originals\", Page recalls a \"Maroon\"-era interview in which bassist Jim Creeggan cited this as his favourite song of theirs, which sparked a realization in Page \"that the song means so much to so many people, and has become a part of people's memories of a certain time in their lives\".\n\nIn the early 2000s, the song was used in television and radio advertising for the New York Lottery. In 2002, it was featured in the episode \"My Fruit Cups\" of \"Scrubs\". The song was also featured in the end credits of Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw's 2006 film \"The Trouble with Money\" and was featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 film \"My Boss's Daughter\". It also appeared in an episode of Bait Car as it was playing loudly on the stereo of the \"stolen\" car.\n\nThe Seattle Mariners played it on the sound system at Safeco Field when Alex Rodriguez batted as a Texas Ranger, as a mocking gesture towards his record-breaking $252 million contract.\n\nIt has been parodied by the Brobdingnagian Bards as \"If I Had a Million Ducats\", replacing the objects and banter with more medieval and Renaissance references.\n\nThe song became an ice cream flavour in May 2009 when the band partnered with American ice cream company Ben & Jerry's to create \"If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours\". The confection consists of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, peanut butter cups, chocolate-coated toffee chunks, white chocolate chunks and chocolate-coated almonds. The band became the first Canadian band to receive their own ice cream flavour, following in the footsteps of other band-themed Ben & Jerry's flavours such as Cherry Garcia (Jerry Garcia), One Sweet Whirled (Dave Matthews Band) and Phish Food (Phish). All royalties from the sale of \"If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours\" are donated to the ABC Canada Literacy Foundation, a Toronto-based organization that promotes reading to children at home.\n\nThe following is a list of things (from the \"Gordon\" version) the narrator would buy for his sweetheart if he had a million dollars:\n\n\nSeveral live changes have been common in performances. The post-chorus banters mentioned earlier are ad libbed at every performance and far more lengthy than the album versions. Due to these banters, the song is typically the longest song in a concert (it typically falls at the end of the main set or as an encore).\n\nThe lyric \"I'd buy you John Merrick's remains\" sometimes has another name substituted, such as John Tesh or John Davidson. The latter can be heard on the \"Rock Spectacle\" album, while the former is heard on \"Live from the River Music Hall Vol. One\" (1998), an album featuring multiple artists recording songs live at WXRV radio in Haverhill, Massachusetts.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the third verse of the song has featured a different groove than the rest of the song, and since the mid-1990s has become a sing-along, with the audience calling back the title line instead of Page. This has continued by Hearn since Page's departure. Both of these are heard on \"Rock Spectacle\".\n\nThe introduction to the song has also occasionally also been used for banter or to sing covers or parodies of songs. In the early 1990s, Page and Robertson would often talk about the intro's \"hot guitar lick\". An example of the intro being used to sing another song is found on the \"Rock Spectacle\" version, in which they sing an excerpt of their own song \"Grade 9.\" The aforementioned \"River Music Hall\" version begins with a parody of Kenny Rogers' \"The Gambler\".\n\nAt the end of the song, the band would often extend the musical outro to allow Page to demonstrate his vocal ability by belting out a short excerpt of another song (typically a cover song). In the past, this tended to lead into a medley of cover songs and rapping known as the \"Barenaked Rap\". This medley was retired in 2002, but was revived after Page's 2009 departure. On the band's tour to support the album \"Maybe You Should Drive\", the song frequently ended on the lyric \"If I Had $1000000, some son-of-a-bitch would die\", an allusion to the Bruce Cockburn song \"If I Had a Rocket Launcher\".\n\nTracks for the two commercial UK singles:\n\n\n\n"}

It is the home ballpark for the Down East Wood Ducks which joined the Carolina League starting in the 2017 season. Grainger was previously home to the Kinston Indians and all the professional Kinston baseball teams since 1949.\n\nThe stadium is located at 400 East Grainger Avenue in Kinston. The original structure was built by architect John J. Rowland in 1949 at a cost of US$170,000 inclusive of everything except the land. Bonds were issued to raised $150,000 of the necessary money. The stadium is owned by the city and leased by the team. A dedicatory plaque identifies the structure as \"Municipal Stadium\", but it has been called Grainger Stadium since it was built. Recent ownership has begun to refer to it as \"Historic Grainger Stadium\" due to its age relative to other fields in the Carolina League. It is the second-oldest stadium in the circuit. The name Grainger comes from the donor of half of the cost of the land on which it is situated, Jesse Willis Grainger. Located on Grainger Avenue, it was initially used by Grainger High School. Grainger is a prominent old family name in Greene and Lenoir Counties.\n\nThe field itself has dimensions of down the left and right field lines, and to straightaway center field. The Grainger Stadium field has been recognized for its quality. This is largely due to the efforts of two men, Lewis B. \"Mac\" McAvery and Tommy Walston. McAvery was the head groundskeeper from 1949 to his death in 1979. In honor of his accomplishments, the team established an annual award in his name to be given to the individual who has done the most to \"preserve and enhance\" professional baseball in Kinston. Walston was the head groundskeeper until the spring of 2008. He was honored with four Carolina League Groundskeeper of the Year awards as well as the Sportsturf Manager of the Year award for all of Class A baseball in 2003. Walston is also president and founder of the Eastern North Carolina Sportsturf Association.\n\nGrainger Stadium has a seating capacity of 3,410 which includes a covered grandstand of eight sections partially protected by netting, uncovered metal bleachers down the third base line, and several rows of uncovered seating along the first base line. There is also a picnic area with tables that have a full view of the playing field. Box seats stretch from first to third base just in front of the grandstand. With the exception of the metal bleachers, all seats in Grainger Stadium are formed plastic. The box seats are squared off sections bordered by metal railing with plastic folding chairs and have waitresses assigned to them. The closest seating is mere inches from the playing field while the furthest seats in the top row of the grandstand sit from the action. During the days of segregation, section one of the grandstand and a now removed set of metal bleachers that sat adjacent to section one were designated for black attendees. A majority of the supporting structure is brick and steel, and steel beams cause some partially obstructed views. The roof is wooden, as is the press box. The outfield wall is made of brick with signs of various materials and a wooden batter's eye.\n\nThe facility is often used for a variety of events besides minor league baseball. In September 1979, the USSSA (slow-pitch softball) World Series was held in Grainger Stadium. The stadium hosted the Colonial Athletic Association Baseball Tournament from 1995 to 1999 and the Conference USA Baseball Tournament in 2002. Two devoted fans who met at a Kinston Indians game decided to get married at the ballpark. On September 30, 2006, Grainger Stadium was the site of the Whole Hog Blues Festival. The facility is often used for regional youth and collegiate baseball tournaments. For example, in May 2007, the ballpark was the site of the 2007 NCAA Division II South Atlantic Regional. It is currently the home of the \"Freedom Classic\" which is the annual baseball series between the Air Force Academy and the Naval Academy.\n\nGrainger Stadium has been renovated often through the years to maintain the facility and to try to keep it up to the standards of professional baseball. At times, these renovations have been quite extensive.\n\nIn January 2007, the Kinston-Lenoir County Tourism Development Authority approved $75,000 to help fund a new scoreboard and video board. The funds were disbursed in $15,000 increments over five years. The City of Kinston provided $175,000 in additional funds toward the project. The new boards cost an estimated $350,000. On August 10, 2016, new turf grass was put down to replace the 18-year-old surface. Other upgrades included those to the parking lot, lighting, grandstand, and outfield wall.\n\n\n"}

His work on the series brought him critical and commercial success along with accolades, such as the British Academy Britannia Award for Excellence in Directing. Yates's subsequent projects include \"The Legend of Tarzan\" (2016), as well as \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" (2016) and its sequel \"\" (2018).\n\nEarly in his career, Yates directed various short films and became a television director. His credits include the six-part political thriller \"State of Play\" (2003), for which he won the Directors Guild of Great Britain Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, the adult two-part documentary drama \"Sex Traffic\" (2004) and the Emmy Award-winning television film \"The Girl in the Café\" (2005).\n\nYates is a founding member of Directors UK. He has had a close partnership with Warner Bros. as a director and producer.\n\nDavid Yates was born in 1963 in Lancashire, England. His parents died when he was young. Raised in the village of Rainhill, Yates was inspired to pursue a career in filmmaking after watching Steven Spielberg's 1975 movie \"Jaws\". Yates's mother bought him a Super 8mm camera. He used this to shoot various films in which his friends and family featured. One such film, \"The Ghost Ship\", was shot on board the vessel where his uncle worked as a cook. He attended Grange Park High School, St Helens College and then the University of Essex. Yates said that he \"used to skive off college all the time\" and never expected to join university before being surprised by his A-Level exam results. While at the University of Essex, Yates formed the Film and Video Production Society. He graduated with a BA in Government in 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Yates made his first film \"When I Was a Girl\" in Swindon. The film entered the festival circuit where it was named Best Short Film at the San Francisco International Film Festival. It contributed towards Yates's acceptance into the National Film and Television School in 1989 and led to the BBC hiring him to direct \"Oranges and Lemons\", a short drama film in 1991. Before completing film school, he began to direct, produce and write the screenplay to the dramatic short \"The Weaver's Wife\". He also made his fourth short film, \"Good Looks\", which was presented at the Chicago International Film Festival. After graduating in 1992, Yates directed an episode of the film studies programme \"Moving Pictures\".\n\nFrom 1994 to 1995, Yates directed several episodes of the ITV police procedural \"The Bill\" before directing and producing three episodes of the television documentary \"Tale of Three Seaside Towns\" alongside producer Alistair Clarke. The programme followed media personalities Russell Grant, Honor Blackman and Pam Ayres visiting and exploring the South Coast towns of Brighton, Eastbourne and Weymouth. Yates directed his fifth short film \"Punch\" before making his feature film debut in 1998 with the release of the independent historical-drama film \"The Tichborne Claimant\". The film, which was shown at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, was written by Joe Fisher and based on the true events of the Tichborne Case. It starred Stephen Fry and Robert Hardy and was shot on location in Merseyside and on the Isle of Man.\n\nYates returned to television in 2000 to direct the episodes of \"Greed\", \"Envy\" and \"Lust\" for the BBC miniseries \"The Sins\", starring Pete Postlethwaite, as well as \"The Way We Live Now\", the four-part television adaptation of the novel of the same name by Anthony Trollope. Yates shared the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial with screenwriter Andrew Davies and producer Nigel Stafford-Clark at the 2002 BAFTA Awards.\n\nOne year later, Yates attended the 56th BAFTA Awards with a British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Short Film for the fourteen-minute production, \"Rank\", which expressed the social elements of racism, friendship and adolescence through the story of a street gang that cross Glasgow to witness the arrival of a group of Somali refugees. Yates said that even though \"The Way We Live Now\" was \"a very big production\" and \"enormous fun to do\", \"Rank\" was an opportunity to \"shake all that off\" and \"get back to [his] roots\". Of the casting, Yates said that he \"wanted to use non-actors to tell the story, to create a reality ... the kids we cast in Glasgow had never done a film before.\" The film was noted for its gritty style and cinematography, with a review from \"Eye For Film\" stating that \"such intelligent use of camera and cast lifts Yates out of the pool of promising young directors into the front line of genuine hopefuls. This work demands respect.\"\n\nThe 2003 six-part thriller \"State of Play\" was Yates's next achievement. Yates collected the TV Spielfilm Award at the Cologne Conference in Germany and won the Directors Guild of Great Britain Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement. The serial was recognised by various award ceremonies, receiving the Peabody Award for Broadcasting Excellence and being presented with two British Academy Television Craft Awards. The quality of the serial sparked Hollywood film bosses to consider adapting it into a film, with producer Andrew Hauptman declaring that \"it's a blistering political thriller and we want to make an equally blistering movie.\" \"State of Play\" is regarded by critics from \"The Guardian\" and \"The Times\" as one of the best British television dramas of the 2000s.\n\nYates directed the television adaptation of nine-year-old Daisy Ashford's novel \"The Young Visiters\", starring Jim Broadbent alongside Hugh Laurie. According to a review by \"Variety\" magazine for BBC America, Yates and his team yielded \"a warm and surprisingly unsentimental production that has 'evergreen' written all over it\".\n\nIn 2004, Yates's two-part drama \"Sex Traffic\" was broadcast on Channel 4. It won eight BAFTA Awards including Best Editing for Mark Day, who regularly worked with Yates on many of his television projects and short films. Day commented on his collaboration with Yates saying that \"we are very good friends because we have spent so much time together\". He also said, \"David shoots in a similar style from piece to piece, although this wasn’t quite as frantic as \"State of Play\".\" Yates was nominated for another Directors Guild of Great Britain Award for his direction of \"Sex Traffic\" and won his second BAFTA for Best Drama Serial at the British Academy Television Awards. Being a British-Canadian production, \"Sex Traffic\" gained four wins at Canada's annual television award ceremony, the Gemini Awards, including Best Dramatic Mini-Series. Spanning across two parts, the three-hour-long drama reveals how the trafficking of young women into slavery is a big business which operates throughout Europe; both parts were acclaimed for their \"shocking\" portrayal of such a sensitive topic.\n\nAlso in 2004, Yates was involved in plans for a film adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's novel \"Brideshead Revisited\" for Warner Independent Pictures. He was set to work with Paul Bettany, Jude Law and Jennifer Connelly on the project, but pulled out in the later stages due to constant budget issues affecting the film's production.\n\nYates then directed Richard Curtis' script to \"The Girl in the Café\", a television film starring Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald. In June 2005, the film was aired on the BBC in Britain and was also broadcast in the United States on Home Box Office. \"The Girl in the Café\" achieved three wins at the Emmy Awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie, and gained a total of four nominations including Outstanding Directing for Yates.\n\nDuring the period of working on plans for \"Brideshead Revisited\", Yates was told by his agent that he had made the director shortlist for the fifth film in the \"Harry Potter\" series and that Warner Bros. was eyeing him to direct. He was then confirmed to direct \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" by Warner Bros. Pictures, with production scheduled to begin in early 2006. When asked how Yates got the job, producer David Heyman (\"a big fan\" of Yates's television work) said that \"actors in David's television projects give their best performance, often of their career. It's important to keep pushing the actors, particularly the young ones on each \"Potter\" film. This is a political film, not with a capital P, but it's about teen rebellion and the abuse of power. David has made films in the U.K. about politics without being heavy handed.\"\n\nBefore production began, Yates invited \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" director Mike Newell to a pub and \"picked his brains about what it was going to be like to step into someone's shoes on a movie of this scale\". The first scene that Yates shot featured a giant interacting with human characters. The scene was the very first high-scale visual effects piece Yates filmed in his career. After the film's post-production material was well received by the studio, Yates was chosen to direct the sixth film, \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", which according to Yates was going to be \"a cross between the chills of \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" [the third film in the series] and the fantastical adventure of \"Goblet of Fire\"\".\n\nIn 2007, \"Order of the Phoenix\" opened to positive reviews and commercial success. Yates won the title of Best Director at the Empire Awards and collected the People's Choice Award from the European Film Academy. However, the film was criticised by fans of the series for having the shortest running time out of the five released instalments; Yates said that the original director's cut was \"probably over three hours\", resulting in much footage being cut, condensed and edited to fit within the studio's preferred time frame.\n\nDuring production of \"Half-Blood Prince\", Warner Bros. executive Alan F. Horn announced that the seventh and final novel in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", was to be split into two cinematic parts with Yates, once again, as the director. Yates spoke of the decision to appoint him as the director of the final films, remarking that \"they wanted to do a \"Harry Potter\" that felt ... more grown up. What's smart about the studio and the producers is they have always wanted to push it a bit. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job of casting and making this world incredibly popular. But rather than do more of the same, they said, 'Let's bring in Alfonso Cuarón and let him run with it. Then later, let's bring in David Yates, who's done all this hard-hitting stuff on TV.' It's a testament to their ambition to try to keep the franchise fresh. The bizarre thing is, I did one [film] and they asked me to stay for three more, so obviously they liked something.\"\n\n\"Half-Blood Prince\" was released in 2009 and became the only film in the series to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. Yates worked alongside French cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel on, what Yates called, extensively colour grading the \"incredibly rich\" picture by making it look \"very European\" and drawing influences from the Dutch painter Rembrandt. The film garnered a mix of accolades and was acclaimed for its stylised character-driven approach, but some fans complained about the script's deviation from the novel and the film's slight romantic comedy nature. In response to this criticism, renowned BAFTA member and film critic Mark Kermode praised Yates's direction and ranked the film \"second best\" in the series, behind \"Prisoner of Azkaban\".\n\nYates began to film \"Deathly Hallows – Part 1\" and \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" back-to-back in early 2009 and finished reshoots in late 2010. He stated that he had shot the two parts of the final adaptation differently, with Part 1 being a \"road movie\" and \"quite real\", \"almost like a vérité documentary\", while Part 2 is \"more operatic, colourful and fantasy-oriented\", a \"big opera with huge battles.\" Yates reshot the final scene of the \"Harry Potter\" series at Leavesden Studios after the original version, filmed at London King's Cross railway station, did not meet his expectations. In the film, the scene takes place at the magical Platform 9¾.\n\nPart 1 was released worldwide in November 2010 to commercial success along with generally positive reviews, some of which reflected on Yates's directing style. \"The Dallas Morning News\" affirmed that \"David Yates' fluid, fast-paced direction sends up the crackling tension of a thriller\" and \"The New York Times\" analysed Yates's approach to J. K. Rowling's character development by saying that he has \"demonstrated a thorough, uncondescending sympathy for her characters, in particular the central trio of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter himself.\" The film was praised for its \"dark\" atmosphere and its loyalty to the source material, but it was criticised for its slow middle act, the handling of exposition, and the somewhat disjointed pacing.\n\nPart 2 was screened in July 2011 and became an instant record-breaking success with critical acclaim. \"The Daily Telegraph\" described Part 2 as \"monumental cinema awash with gorgeous tones\" and \"Total Film\" wrote that Yates combines \"spectacle and emotion into a thrilling final chapter.\" Author J. K. Rowling remarked that \"everyone who watches \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" is going to see that he's steered us home magnificently. It's incredible.\" Part 2 is the only \"Harry Potter\" film to pass the $1 billion mark during its original theatrical run; it became the highest-grossing film in the series and the highest-grossing film of 2011, making Yates the director of the highest-grossing non-James Cameron film of all time in August 2011. Amongst other accolades, Yates won his second Empire Award for Best Director and joined the principal creative team of \"Harry Potter\" in receiving the 2012 ADG Award for Outstanding Contribution to Cinematic Imagery for their work on \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" and the series in general.\n\nYates attended the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011, where he was joined by J. K. Rowling, David Heyman, Mike Newell, Alfonso Cuarón, David Barron, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson in collecting the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema on behalf of the \"Harry Potter\" films. Daniel Radcliffe, who portrayed the films' titular character, commented on working with Yates, saying that he \"added his own sense of grit and realism [to the series] that perhaps wasn't there so much before. I think we all had a fantastic time working with David. I know we did.\"\n\nBy 2012, Yates was working on a few Warner Bros. projects, including a \"Tarzan\" feature film and an Al Capone biopic called \"Cicero\". He also controversially said that he was working with BBC Worldwide on plans to develop a \"Doctor Who\" film, although this was denied by the showrunner, Steven Moffat, in July 2012. Because of production delays, Yates began to explore other projects including television work.\nIn 2013, he returned to television by signing on to direct the television pilot of \"Tyrant\", an American drama production set against the US–Middle East conflict. The following year, Yates began shooting \"The Legend of Tarzan\", starring Alexander Skarsgård, Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie, Djimon Hounsou, Jim Broadbent, and Christoph Waltz. The film, released in 2016, opened to mixed reviews and a worldwide total of $356.7 million.\n\nYates directed \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", a 2016 film which is the first in a series of five instalments based on J. K. Rowling's book, set in the world of her \"Harry Potter\" novels. David Heyman and \"Harry Potter\" screenwriter Steve Kloves joined Yates and J. K. Rowling in developing the script. The film was released in November 2016, it received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success having grossed $814 million , The film stars Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, Colin Farrell, and Johnny Depp. Yates directed the 2018 sequel, \"\" which received mixed critical reception but emerged a box office success having grossed $654 million. In an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", he stated he was open to directing all five planned films in the \"Fantastic Beasts\" series.\n\nYates has a younger brother and an elder sister. He is married to Yvonne Walcott.\n\nEmma Watson stated that Yates liked to push the cast and crew to physical and emotional extremes, with Gary Oldman confirming Yates's preference for working slowly by shooting numerous takes to draw the best performances out of the cast. Yates has been influenced by such directors as Steven Spielberg, David Lean, and Ken Loach. Yates's style of work includes social and political themes, character-driven narratives, realism, and atmospheric drama.\n\n\n\"Only certain awards for Yates's direction are shown in this section.

Before his release on April 15, 2020, Chioda was the longest-tenured referee in WWE history, having been with the company since 1989.\n\nAs a young adult, Chioda lived close to the Marellas (Gorilla Monsoon and his son Joey), who helped him break into the wrestling business. Being trained as a referee, Chioda first began to appear in WWE in 1989, when it was known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), most notably at Survivor Series 1989. After taking a hiatus from refereeing following WrestleMania VII, he began to reappear on camera around 1992.\n\nHe refereed the match where The 1-2-3 Kid (on that night he was the Kid) as a jobber scored a huge upset over Razor Ramon. In May 1996, Chioda was involved in a controversial ending of a WWF title match at , during the match between Shawn Michaels and the British Bulldog, referee for the match Earl Hebner got injured and knocked out of the ring during the match and Chioda came to the ring as a replacement, when Michaels performed a German suplex, Chioda counted Michaels' shoulders down and awarded the match to the Bulldog, but at the same time Chioda counted Michaels down, Hebner came back in the ring and counted Bulldog's shoulders down and awarded the match to Shawn Michaels, then (on screen) President Gorilla Monsoon came to ring and declared the match a draw. On July 3, 1999 on \"Shotgun\", Chioda got an Implant DDT from Gangrel following his loss against Test which Chioda officiated.\n\nChioda has also competed in an actual wrestling match, teaming with Chris Jericho and The Rock to take on the team of The Dudley Boyz and referee Nick Patrick on an episode of \"SmackDown\" in 2001. Chioda actually scored the pinfall victory after delivering his version of \"The People's Elbow\" to Nick Patrick.\n\nDuring the WWF tenure, he officiated matches such as Shawn Michaels vs. Steve Austin at WrestleMania XIV, Triple H vs. Vince McMahon at Armageddon 1999, The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8.\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, Chioda began to wear an American flag patch on his referee shirt.\n\nDuring the WWE Brand Extension, Chioda was sent to \"SmackDown!\" to become senior referee of that show. On an \"All Referee\" edition of the WWE.com show \"Byte This!\" in 2004, he told an inquiring Josh Mathews that he did not like the old-style \"button-up and bow-tie\" referee attire, preferring, at the time, the \"SmackDown!\" variant of referee shirt.\n\nDuring his tenure on \"SmackDown\", he officiated a match between Big Show and Brock Lesnar in which Lesnar performed a superplex on Big Show and the ring collapsed. Chioda would rule the match a no contest.\n\nIn 2003, he was traded to \"Raw\". Following the firing of Raw's senior referee Earl Hebner in 2005, Chioda was appointed as \"Raw\"`s head referee.\n\nAt WrestleMania 23 he refereed the match between John Cena and Shawn Michaels, but was taken out after being hit with Sweet Chin Music by Michaels.\n\nDuring his time as \"Raw\" brand head referee he would officiate Raw matches such as Triple H vs. Batista at WrestleMania 21, John Cena vs. Triple H at WrestleMania 22, Cena vs. Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 23 and Cena vs Batista at SummerSlam 2008, WrestleMania XXVI, Extreme Rules 2010, and Over the Limit 2010 (Batista's last match in WWE before he quit for the first time). He also appeared in an episode of \"WWE Tough Enough\"s second season.\n\nIn November 2008, referees were made no longer exclusive to certain brands. Chioda refereed his first match on SmackDown in three years on November 28, 2008, when he refereed the Beat The Clock Match between Shelton Benjamin and Triple H; during the match, Chioda was knocked down and the match ended in controversy when it was decided that Jeff Hardy and Triple H finished their matches in the same amount of time. To settle this, the WWE Championship Match at Armageddon 2008 was made a Triple Threat Match.\n\nAt the pay-per-view event WWE Over The Limit 2011, The Miz initially defeated John Cena after a cell phone recording of Cena's voice saying \"I Quit\" was played into the microphone, although when the referee Mike Chioda heard it, he immediately reversed the decision and ordered the match to restart.

The story follows a Lhasa Apso dog.\n\nOn December 8, 1999, Daily Variety reported that Parker and Stone were going to produce 39 shorts that were to be 3-5 minutes long. In January 2000, the duo announced that they would have full creative and artistic control of the series.\n\nThe animated short was originally produced with Macromedia Flash in 2001 and was meant to be showcased on Macromedia's sister-site shockwave.com. Stone and Parker never heard back from shockwave.com after submitting the first two episodes.\n\nParker has stated that he and Stone would love to do more episodes if someone wanted to distribute them and has encouraged fans with Flash skills to continue the story themselves.\n\nPrincess is awakened by a strange squishing sound. It is a man being manually masturbated by his wife. She is unsuccessful in bringing him to orgasm because he has taken a large dosage of Viagra. After three hours of sexual activity the woman begins performing fellatio. When the fellatio is unsuccessful he plays a porn movie on the television. When the porn movie is unsuccessful he changes the channel to a show about interior decorating featuring Christopher Lowell, at which point he reaches orgasm. The force from the hours of sexual activity causes the semen to fly right through her head, killing her in the process. The episode ends with the semen-covered dog sneezing as the man asks her \"What are we going to do?\".\n\nLater in the morning, as police officers survey the scene, the husband gives information about the crime scene to Officer Friendly, the man in charge of the investigation. Officer Friendly says this is the 18th case of the aforementioned incident since Viagra was introduced to the public. The husband then goes to inform his son, Tommy, about the wife. Meanwhile, a man claiming to be a coroner enters the house and asks for 20 minutes alone with the body. In reality, he is a necrophiliac, and performs anal sex with the corpse. Princess tries to tell Officer Friendly and his partner (a parody of the television show \"Lassie\") but they assume the dog is in heat. Princess then enters Tommy's room where the husband unsuccessfully attempts to explain to his son what happened. Princess barks and Tommy thinks the dog is telling him to \"see Mommy\". The episode ends with Tommy opening his parents' bedroom door to find the necrophiliac engaged in sexual acts with his mother's corpse.\n\nAt the end of the \"Officer Friendly\" episode, the viewers are invited to see the next installment, \"Princess Finds A Red Balloon\". However, according to South Park Studios, the episode was never produced following the rejection of the first two.\n"}

They were quite popular in Bulgaria, and occasionally topped the charts. Their style comprised punk, ska, reggae, funk and some traditional Bulgarian folk music elements. The witty lyrics filled with wordplay dealing mainly with stories from everyday life and the danceable tunes with memorable hooks largely contributed to the band's success.\n\nWickeda are one of the most well-known bands in Bulgaria, and have existed for quite a long time, given the unstable Bulgarian music market. When their first album \"Революция\" (\"Revolution\") appeared in 1999, it caught immediately the attention of musicians, journalists and music fans alike. The album was something of a turning point for the ailing Bulgarian popular music scene. It signalled the emergence of a new wave of Bulgarian rock and electronic bands on and around the label \"Жълта музика\" (\"Yellow Music\"). Bulgaria's leading music magazine at the time, \"New Rhythm\" chose it as one of the 35 best Bulgarian albums ever, and Wickeda won the prize for Best band and Best newcomer awarded by the music TV channel MM. The single \" \"А ние с Боби двамата пием кафе\"\" (\"And I and Bobby, We are Both Drinking Coffee\") stayed in MM's Top Ten for 10 weeks and the album sold over 30,000 copies.\n\nIn 2000 Wickeda released their second album \"Затова, защото...\" (\"That's Why, Because...\"). The first single, \"Уиски с фъстъци\" (\"Whiskey and Peanuts\") again reached high positions in the Top Ten. At the yearly MM-awards they won prizes for Best band and Best album. The second album sold over 20,000 copies.\n\nThe third album \"До тук\" (\"Until Here\"), a retrospective of Wickeda's work, came out in 2001, including four new songs. During their European tour (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary), they released a single out of their fourth album \"Осъзнай се класово\" (approx. \"Realise your Class Membership\") in advance. After the tour the album was completed and managed once again to make it into the Top Ten.\n\nIn the summer of 2004 came the fifth and final album called \"1618\". There were some new Balkan influences, while the style of the band was still varied and got even harder. A lot of the tracks on the album were English translations of older songs, albeit three new songs, \"Секси\" (Sexy), \"Ми да\" (I'm Here!) and \"The Letter\", were added. The Bulgarian version of \"The Letter\" has never been released, although the CD-Text of \"1618\" refers to it as \"Pismo nov voc\". In the autumn Wickeda made another European tour presenting their new album in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, and Bulgaria.\n\nIn October 2009 UK dubstep producer Ramadanman, in conjunction with the British Council and Hessle Audio, released a 500 limited edition white label remix 12\" single of the Wickeda track \"А Ние Двамата с Боби Пием Кафе\" from their 1999 debut album 'Revolution'. The Hessle Audio co-owner and producer was approached by the council to remix a track picked by the Bulgarian public, drawn from a selection of their top 10 90's Bulgarian pop songs.\n\nIn 2010 they were headliners at Spirit of Burgas after Everlast couldn't make it because of sickness.\n\nOn 10 June 2018, bandleader Erol Ibrahimov announced the end of the band on his personal Facebook page, stating that the band \"had no more to say\" after 21 years.\n\n\n\nThey have played numerous festivals and made several tours abroad, even overseas:\n\nThey have also had their own successful gigs in Prague and Budapest.\n\n"}
{"id": "2269151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269151", "title": "Paten", "text": "Paten\n\nA paten, or diskos, is a small plate, usually made of silver or gold, used to hold Eucharistic bread which is to be consecrated during the Mass. It is generally used during the liturgy itself, while the reserved sacrament are stored in the tabernacle in a ciborium.\n\nIn many Western liturgical denominations, the paten is typically either a simple saucer-like plate or a low bowl. A smaller style paten will often have a depression that allows it to securely sit on top of the chalice, as shown in the illustration on the left here.\n\nThe General Instruction of the Roman Missal lays down rules for patens: \"Sacred vessels should be made from precious metal. If they are made from metal that rusts or from a metal less precious than gold, they should generally be gilded on the inside.\" However, provisions for vessels made from non-precious metals are made as well, provided they are \"made from other solid materials which in the common estimation in each region are considered precious or noble.\"\n\nSome call the communion-plate a \"paten\", but the English translation of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal approved by the English-speaking episcopal conferences and confirmed by the Holy See uses \"communion-plate\" to speak of this object (numbers 118 and 187) and reserves the term \"paten\" for the other object (numbers 84, 117, 141, etc.). The two corresponding Latin terms are \"patina\" (communion-plate) and \"patena\" (paten).\n\nPatens are also used among Anglicans and Lutherans.\n\nIn the United Methodist Church, during the Order for the Ordination of Elders, each elder receives a stole, along with a chalice and paten, from the bishop after the part of the liturgy in which the bishop lays his hands and prays over the ministerial candidates. This is because the newly ordained elders are now able to celebrate the Sacraments, such as Holy Communion. In the Methodist service of the Holy Communion, the bread is placed upon a paten during the offertory and once again after it consecrated, specifically following the fraction. The paten, along with the chalice, lies on the altar during the celebration of the Holy Eucharist.\n\nIn the Byzantine Rite Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Catholic Churches, the paten is called a \"diskos\" and is elevated by a stand (or \"foot\") permanently attached underneath. The diskos is usually more ornate than its Latin Rite counterpart, and must always be made of gold or at least be gold-plated. The diskos may be engraved with an icon of Jesus Christ, the Nativity of Christ, the Cross, or most frequently the Theotokos. \n\nWhen a diskos is made, it is usually accompanied by a matching asterisk (small, folding metal stand used to keep the Aër from disturbing the particles on the diskos), a spoon (for distributing Holy Communion to the faithful), and a spear (used to cut the Lamb during the Liturgy of Preparation). \n\nFor Christians of historically Eastern church families, the diskos symbolises the Ever-virgin Mary, who received God the Word into her womb and gave birth to him, as well as the Tomb of Christ, which received his body after the Crucifixion and from which he resurrected.\n\nDuring the Divine Liturgy it is not only the Lamb (Host) that is placed on the diskos, but also particles to commemorate the Theotokos, the Saints, the living and the departed. Thus, on the diskos is represented the entire Church: the Church Militant and the Church Triumphant, arrayed around Christ. At the Great Entrance the deacon carries the Diskos, holding the foot of the diskos at his forehead. He then kneels at the side of the Holy Table, and the priest takes the diskos from him and places it on the Antimension. During the Anaphora, only the Lamb is consecrated.\n\nAt Holy Communion, the clergy partake of their portions of the Lamb directly from the diskos, but for the Communion of the faithful, the remainder of the Lamb is cut into small portions and placed in the chalice, from which the priest distributes Communion using the spoon. After Communion, the Deacon holds the diskos above the holy chalice and recites hymns of the Resurrection. Then he wipes the remaining particles (for the saints, living and departed) into the chalices saying the words: \"Wash away, O Lord, the sins of all those here commemorated, by Thy precious Blood, through the prayers of all Thy saints.\"\n\nSometimes, when a bishop celebrates the Liturgy, a smaller diskos is prepared for him with a small prosphoron from which he takes particles to commemorate the living and the departed before the Great Entrance.\n\nDuring the Consecration of a Church, a diskos is used to hold the relics of the saints which will be sealed in the Holy Table and antimension by the bishop.\n\nWhen a priest is ordained, a portion of the Lamb will be placed on a small diskos and given to him, as a sign of the Sacred Mysteries which are being entrusted to his care.\n\nIn the Russian tradition, there is a special liturgy of blessing used to sanctify a diskos before its first use at Liturgy. The diskos may be blessed separately or together in a set with the other sacred vessels. The blessing is normally done immediately before beginning of the Liturgy of Preparation, after which the priest carries the diskos into the sanctuary and begins the liturgy, using the newly blessed vessel in that Liturgy. \n\nUp until the first time a diskos is used in the Divine Liturgy it is considered to be an ordinary vessel, and may be touched by anyone. However, after having been used in the Divine Liturgy, a diskos may be touched only by a deacon, priest or bishop. A subdeacon may touch the sacred vessels, but only if they are securely wrapped in cloth. \n\nWhen not in use, the chalice, diskos, and all the sacred vessels should remain on the Table of Oblation (prothesis), wrapped in their cloth bags—either sitting on top and covered with a cloth, or stored securely in a cabinet built into the prothesis.\n\nIn the usage of the Alexandrian Rite, the diskos usually has a flat bottom with no foot. Additionally, it has a raised edge, forming a relatively high rim, preventing particles of the offered elements from falling to the floor.\n"}

He received a Bachelor of Laws from Harvard Law School in 1927. On June 23, 1927, the \"Harvard Crimson\" reported that Friendly was the first Harvard Law graduate to receive a degree \"summa cum laude.\" Felix Frankfurter, as a professor at Harvard Law School, sent his student Friendly to work as a clerk for Justice Louis Brandeis of the United States Supreme Court, where he served from 1927 to 1928. He was in private practice of law in New York City, New York from 1928 to 1959. He was a founding partner of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, where his law partners included George W. Ball and Melvin Steen. He was vice president and general counsel of Pan American World Airways in New York City from 1946 to 1959.\n\nFriendly was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on March 10, 1959, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated by Judge Harold Medina. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 9, 1959, and received his commission on September 10, 1959. He served as Chief Judge and as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1971 to 1973. He assumed senior status on April 15, 1974. He was a Judge of the Special Railroad Court from 1974 to 1986, serving as Presiding Judge from 1974 to 1986. His service was terminated on March 11, 1986, due to his death.\n\nFriendly took his own life at age 82 on March 11, 1986, in his Park Avenue apartment in New York City. Police said they found three notes in the apartment, one addressed to his resident maid and two unaddressed notes. In all three notes, the judge talked about his distress at his wife's death, his declining health and his failing eyesight, according to a police spokesman. His wife, the former Sophie M. Stern, had died a year and four days earlier. They had been married for 55 years.\n\nIn a ceremony following Friendly's death, then-Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger said, \"In my 30 years on the bench, I have never known a judge more qualified to sit on the Supreme Court.\" At the same ceremony, Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall called Friendly \"a man of the law.\" In a letter to the editor of \"The New York Times\" following Friendly's obituary, 2nd Circuit Judge Jon O. Newman called Friendly \"quite simply the pre-eminent appellate judge of his era\" who \"authored the definitive opinions for the nation in each area of the law that he had occasion to consider.\" In a statement after Friendly's death, Judge Wilfred Feinberg, the 2nd Circuit's chief judge at the time, called Friendly \"one of the greatest Federal judges in the history of the Federal bench.\" United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Judge Richard A. Posner described Friendly as \"the most distinguished judge in this country during his years on the bench.\"\n\nHarvard Law School has a professorship named after Friendly. Paul C. Weiler, a Canadian constitutional law scholar, held it from 1993 to 2006; William J. Stuntz, a scholar of criminal law and procedure, held it from 2006 until his death in March 2011. The professorship is currently held by Carol S. Steiker, a specialist in criminal justice policy and capital punishment. The Federal Bar Council awarded Friendly a Certificate of Distinguished Judicial Service posthumously in 1986. The American Law Institute has an award named in memory of Friendly and endowed by his former law clerks.\n\nFriendly's wife of 55 years died a year before his suicide. He was survived by a son and two daughters.\n\n"}

She is an adjunct clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan Medical Center. She served as director of research and training at the Center for Forensic Psychiatry in Ann Arbor for 25 years and was president of the American Psychiatric Association from 1990 to 1991. She is regarded as an expert on child abuse and trauma, and has testified in high-profile court cases. She also focuses on ethics, psychiatric aspects of disasters and terrorism, and domestic violence. In addition to her own books, book chapters, and articles, she has collaborated with her husband, attorney Richard S. Benedek, on studies of divorce, child custody, and child abuse.\n\nElissa Panush was born in Detroit, Michigan on September 28, 1936 to Louis and Tillie Panush. Her father was a school principal and science teacher, and her mother taught in elementary school. She had three sisters. She graduated from Central High School in Detroit in 1954 and won a scholarship to the University of Michigan.\n\nShe earned her undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan and went on to attend the medical school on the same campus. She chose to specialize in psychiatry since it was one of the few specialties open to women physicians in that era, and would also allow the flexibility of maintaining a medical practice while raising a family. She trained in general psychiatry at the medical school's neuropsychiatric institute and in child psychiatry at the Children's Psychiatric Hospital on campus. She earned her M.D. in 1960, and completed her residency in 1962 and a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry in 1964.\n\nAfter finishing her residency, she began working as a psychiatrist at the York Wood Center, a residential treatment facility for youth in Ypsilanti. She next moved to the Center for Forensic Psychiatry to become associate director of child psychiatry and the center's first director of training and research. During her tenure, she helped formulate a forensic fellowship program which later became a joint venture with the University of Michigan. In 1975 she performed a preliminary evaluation of as-yet uncharged serial killer Coral Watts at the center.\n\nBy 1991 she was a full professor in clinical psychiatry at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University School of Medicine. She is also a faculty member of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Depression Center. She maintains a private practice in Ann Arbor for child, adolescent, adult, and forensic psychiatry.\n\nShe is regarded as an expert on child abuse and trauma, and also focuses on ethics, the psychiatric aspects of disasters and terrorism, and domestic violence. She has testified in numerous high-profile court cases. In 1975 she testified for the defense in the murder trial of Ruth Childers, advancing the psychological theory of battered woman's syndrome first developed by Lenore E. Walker. In the 1980s she testified in the Wee Care Nursery School abuse trial, and was the primary psychiatric witness for Dr. Eric Foretich in his February 1987 civil court proceeding related to the Morgan v. Foretich child custody case. She was accused of child abuse by Foretich's ex-wife Elizabeth Morgan, who surreptitiously filmed Benedek during her examination of her daughter, and was accused of perjury by Morgan's mother, who filed a complaint with the APA over Benedek's testimony that Morgan had probably been abused by her own father. She testified for the U.S. government in a 1998 lawsuit against Playboy Television about signal bleed of adult material on cable television.\n\nBenedek mentors medical students, psychiatry residents, and forensic psychiatry fellows at the University of Michigan, allowing the latter to \"shadow\" her during her courtroom appearances.\n\nBenedek was president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) from 1990 to 1991. She was only the second woman to be named to this post since the association was founded in 1844. Previously, she served as vice president (1983–1985), secretary (1985– ), and trustee of the APA.\n\nIn 2001 she was appointed as a director of the American Council on Science and Health.\n\nIn 2016 Benedek received the Alexandra Symonds Award from the APA and the Association of Women Psychiatrists in recognition of her \"significant contributions to promoting women's health and the advancement of women\".\n\nShe met her husband, Richard Sandor Benedek, at the University of Michigan, where he was studying law. He received his J.D. in 1958 and they married between Elissa's sophomore and junior years. They have four children. Richard maintains a law practice in Ann Arbor.

Born in a wealthy family, she travelled around the world and painted described scenes and life as she saw them. She was a friend and influencer of the travel writers and artists Marianne North and Isabella Bird.\n\nEka's grandfather Sir Alexander Cumming inherited the wealth of his wife and the name and arms of Gordon of Gordonstoun in 1804 and used the hyphenated double surname which was not consistently used by family members. She was born on 26 May 1837 at Altyre, near Forres in Scotland, the 12th child of a wealthy family. Her parents were Sir William Gordon Gordon-Cumming, 2nd Baronet, and Eliza Maria Gordon-Cumming, granddaughter of the Duke of Argyll. Eka was the aunt of Sir William Gordon-Cumming, 4th Baronet. Little is known about her early education but she would have had private home tutors. Her mother was interested in geology and was familiar with the works of Robert Murchison. A Swiss maid, Cherie, taught her French and after the death of her mother in 1848, she went to live with an aunt in Northumberland. She went to Hermitage Lodge at Fulham leaving it in 1853. Many of her family members were travellers, an uncle Charles Cumming-Bruce married the grand-daughter of the Nile explorer James Bruce of Kinnaird. Her brother Alexander had been Canada while another, Roualeyn had been Africa where he had been famous as a big-game hunter. Another brother John was a planter in Ceylon while William was a soldier in India. William wrote about his hunting in \"Wild Men and Wild Beasts\" (1871) dedicated to Col. Walter Campbell (\"The Old Forest Ranger\"). Her travelling phase began around 1866 when she was in Loch Ness where her terminally ill brother Roualeyn was being nursed by another sister. In 1868 she went on a painting tour with her half-brother Frederick to the Western Islands. She taught herself how to paint, and had help from artists visiting her home, including one of Queen Victoria's favorite painters, Sir Edwin Landseer. She also took an invitation from her half-sister Emilia Sergison to visit India and after spending a year there she wrote \"In the Himalayas and on the Indian Plains\" (1884). This was followed by, \"twelve years of enchanting travel which followed would never have been dreamt of, for link by link that pleasant chain wove itself\", as she described it.\n\nGordon-Cumming was a prolific travel writer and landscape painter who traveled the world, mostly in Asia and the Pacific. She painted over a thousand watercolors and worked with a motto to ‘never a day without at least one careful-coloured sketch’ starting her day at 5am while in India. Places she visited include Australia, New Zealand, America, China, and Japan. She arrived in Hilo, Hawaii in October 1879, and was among the first artists to paint the active volcanoes. Her Hawaii travelogue, \"Fire Fountains: The Kingdom of Hawaii\", was published in Edinburgh in 1883. She had several dangerous moments but her travel ended in 1880 when the Montana that she was on ran into rocks at Holyhead. While most of the passengers took the lifeboat, she stayed on last along with the captain to save her paintings and was rescued many hours later. She returned to live at Crieff with her widowed sister Eleanor and continued to write books.\n\nHer best known books are \"At Home in Fiji\" and \"A Lady's Cruise on a French Man-of-War\". The latter book resulted from an invitation to join a French ship put into service for the Bishop of Samoa so that he could visit remote parts of his far-flung diocese.\n\nMiss Gordon-Cumming received much criticism from male writers of the era, perhaps because she did not fit in the traditional Victorian role of women, as she often traveled alone and unaided. Henry Adams said her books are a collection of anecdotes without much interest. In any case, her landscape drawings and watercolors seem to be universally admired.\n\nGordon-Cumming visited Yosemite Valley in April 1878, after visiting Tahiti. She intended to visit for 3 days, but ended up staying 3 months. She says \"I for one have wandered far enough over the wide world to know a unique glory when I am blessed by the sight of one . . .\" She published her letters back home as \"Granite Crags\" in 1884. While in Yosemite Miss Gordon-Cumming also drew watercolor sketches, which she displayed in Yosemite Valley—making it the first art exhibition in Yosemite.\n\nIn 1879, while visiting Peking, China, Miss Gordon-Cumming met William Hill Murray, a Scottish missionary to China. He had invented the Numeral Type system, through which blind and illiterate Chinese learned to read and write, by assigning numbers to each of the 408 Chinese Mandarin sounds. Gordon-Cumming wrote a book (1899) about the system and supported the school for the rest of her life. She died in Scotland on 4 September 1924, and is buried near Crieff.\n\nThe Honolulu Museum of Art, the Oakland Museum of California and the Yosemite Museum are among the public collections holding works by Constance Gordon-Cumming.\n\n"}

It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico on the east by a number of barrier islands, including Barra Los Americanos, Barra Jesús María, and Barra Soto la Marina, and is bounded on the west by mainland Tamaulipas. It is located in the municipalities of Matamoros, San Fernando, and Soto la Marina.\n\nThe Laguna Madre is very shallow, with an average depth of only 0.9 m. The lagoon is connected to the ocean by only two narrow inlets, so the tidal range – which is already minor in this part of the Gulf of Mexico – is negligible. Atmospheric effects are much more important than tides in its circulation; its weak currents generally follow the prevailing winds, and these winds can influence the water level by as much as a meter.\n\nOceanographically, the Laguna Madre is considered a \"hypersaline lagoon\"; this indicates that it is usually much saltier than the ocean, due to being nearly landlocked in a semiarid environment This is because its salinity can vary wildly depending on rainfall and freshwater inflow, from as high as 120 ppt (12%) – over three times saltier than the ocean – to as low as 2 ppt (0.2%) after a heavy rain.\n\nLaguna Madre is one of the most important bird wintering habitats in Mexico. Thanks to lobbying and studies done by organizations such as Pronatura Noreste, universities, local governments, and other organizations, with the aid of local communities, in April 2005 the Mexican government declared Laguna Madre and the Río Bravo’s Delta a Natural Protected Area. The 1.4 million acres (5,700 km²) under legal protection are contained in the municipalities of Matamoros, San Fernando and Soto la Marina, in the state of Tamaulipas.\n\n"}

{"id": "2269233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269233", "title": "Memorial Acclamation", "text": "Memorial Acclamation\n\nThe Memorial Acclamation is an acclamation sung or recited by the people after the institution narrative of the Eucharist. They were common in ancient eastern liturgies and have more recently been introduced into Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist liturgies.\n\nThe Liturgy of St James is the principal liturgy of the Syriac Orthodox Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, Maronite Church, and Malankara Orthodox Church. It is also occasionally used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Melkite Catholic Church and other Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite.\n\nIn the Syriac form of this liturgy, after the Words of Institution, to which the people respond with \"Amen\" after the formula for the blessing of the bread and again after the formula for the blessing of the chalice, the priest celebrant says: \"Do in remembrance of Me when you partake of this sacrament, commemorating My death and My resurrection until I come.\" The people then respond with the acclamation: \"Your death, our Lord, we commemorate, Your resurrection we confess and Your second coming we wait for. May Your mercy be upon us all.\"\n\nIn the Byzantine form of the Liturgy of St James, the priest celebrant says: \"This do in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show forth the Lord's death, and confess His resurrection, till He comes.\" The people respond: \"We show forth Thy death, O Lord, and confess Thy resurrection.\"\n\nThe Memorial Acclamation was introduced into the Roman Rite of Mass in 1969 as part of the revision of the Roman Missal by Pope Paul VI. Previously the only acclamations by the people in the eucharistic prayer were the Sanctus and the Amen to the final doxology.\n\nThe three acclamations given in the Roman Missal are, in the official English translation, as follows:\n\nThe initial edition of the Roman Missal in English, which in part was a more dynamic rather than literal translation of the original, had instead the following four acclamations:\n\nAs a lead to the Memorial Acclamation, the priest says or sings: \"The mystery of faith\".\n\nThis introductory phrase, \"mysterium fidei\" in the Latin original, was previously translated loosely into English as \"Let us proclaim the mystery of faith\", and in some places was sung or spoken by the deacon instead of the priest in spite of the clear instruction in the Missal itself and in the apostolic constitution \"Missale Romanum\" with which Pope Paul VI promulgated the revision of the Roman Missal. The English translation was corrected in 2011 and now reads simply: \"The mystery of faith\".\n\nBefore the 1969 revision of the Roman Missal, the phrase \"mysterium fidei\" was included in the formula of consecration of the wine spoken inaudibly by the priest, appearing as follows (here accompanied by an unofficial English translation):\n\nSome traditionalist Catholics have criticised the removal of the phrase \"mysterium fidei\" from the words of consecration.\n\nThe phrase \"mysterium fidei\" was added to the words of consecration at some time before the 6th century, perhaps by Pope Leo I (440-461) and perhaps, in reaction to the denial by Manichaeism of the goodness of material things, as an expression of the Catholic Church's belief that salvation comes through Christ's material blood and through participation in the sacrament, which makes use of a material element.\n\nThe memorial acclamations that follow suggest that \"the mystery of faith\" refers, in its new context, to \"the entire mystery of salvation through Christ's death, resurrection and ascension, which is made present in the celebration of the Eucharist\". An alternative memorial acclamation permitted in Ireland, \"My Lord and my God\", was disapproved of by Pope Paul VI for seemingly concentrating on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist rather than on Eucharistic sacrifice as a whole, but even this may be interpreted in the same sense, since it is a repetition of what in refers to Christ as risen and as still bearing the marks of his suffering.\n\nIn its 1979 version of the Book of Common Prayer, the Episcopal Church (United States) has in Prayer B the acclamation:\nIn three of its Rite 2 eucharistic prayers, the acclamation is made by celebrant and people together.\n\nThe \"Book of Alternative Services\" of the Anglican Church of Canada has a Memorial Acclamation, as have some United Methodist churches.\n\nLutherans also have an acclamation.\n"}

This translation of the text is exceptional, since far more numerous are the Bible versions that render the phrase as \"the mystery of the faith\", while others still have phrases like \"the deep truths of the faith\" (New International Version and New International Reader's Version); \"the secret of the faith that God made known to us\" (New Century Version); \"the revealed truth of the faith\" (Good News Translation); \"the mystery of the Christian faith\" (God's Word Translation); \"the true faith that God has now made known to us\" (Easy-to-Read Version); \"what God has shown us about our faith\" (Contemporary English Version); \"the faith that has been revealed\" (Common English Bible); \"the secret of the faith\" (Young's Literal Translation); \"God's plan and what we believe\" (Worldwide English).\n\nThe passage in question requires deacons to hold to this \"mystery of faith\", \"the deep truths of the faith\", \"the true faith that God has now made known to us\" or however else it can best be expressed. Richard C. H. Lenski identifies it with \"the mystery of godliness\" mentioned in verse 16 of the same chapter. According to Witness Lee, it is mainly Christ and the church. This mystery, Andrew Louth says, interrogates us rather than being questioned by us. Barnes' Notes on the Bible identifies the word \"the faith\" in this context with \"the gospel\", a view with which Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible agrees, as does the People's New Testament, while Clarke's communion on the Bible remarks that one manuscripts gives, in place of \"the faith\", \"the resurrection of the dead, which is one of the greatest mysteries of the faith. Floyd H. Barackman says that in this passage \"the faith\" refers to the whole of the New Testament.\n\nArthur Edward Waite wrote that in the Zohar, which is the foundational work of the Jewish Kabbalah, there lie embedded fragments of a mystical work, Sepher ha-bahir, an anonymous work of Jewish mysticism, attributed to the 1st century, behind which Waite discerned \"a single radical and essential thesis which is spoken of in general terms as 'The Mystery of Faith'.\" The Mystery of Faith, he said, is represented by the letter of the Tetragrammaton and is identical with the Mystery of Sex. He saw the Mystery of Faith as underlying also popular Christian devotion, such as the veneration of relics, and the doctrine of the Eucharist, and the legends of the Grail as telling that \"the secret words, which were of the essence of the Mystery of Faith, had passed out of all common knowledge\".\n\nIn theology, an article of faith or doctrine which defies man's ability to grasp it fully, something that transcends reason, is called \"a mystery of the faith\". The Catechism of the Catholic Church speaks of the Trinity as \"a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the 'mysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless they are revealed by God'\", and it declares: \"The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of Christian faith and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that enlightens them.\" The Church itself is \"a mystery of the faith\".\n\nLudwig Feuerbach applied the phrase \"the mystery of faith\" to belief in the power of prayer.\n\n\"The Mystery of Faith\" is used in the title of some books as a reference to the totality of the doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church or of the Catholic Church. More frequent are books of that title that refer to Roman Catholic doctrine on the Eucharist, which was the subject also of a papal encyclical by Pope Paul VI, whose incipit was \"Mysterium fidei\" (Latin for \"mystery of faith\" or \"mystery of the faith\").\n\nThe phrase \"a mystery of faith\", rather than \"the mystery of faith\", appears also with reference to the Eucharist, as in the title of a book by Joseph M. Champlin.\n\nSince November 2011, the phrase \"mysterium fidei\" in the Roman Rite liturgy of the Mass is officially translated as \"the mystery of faith\", while from 1973 to 2011 the English phrase used as an equivalent was \"Let us proclaim the mystery of faith\".\n\nIn this context, the phrase, spoken or sung after the Words of Institution, refers to \"the entire mystery of salvation through Christ's death, resurrection and ascension, which is made present in the celebration of the Eucharist\". As originally inserted into the words of consecration, perhaps in reaction to the denial by Manichaeism of the goodness of material things, it may have been an expression of the Catholic Church's belief that salvation comes through Christ's material blood and through participation in the sacrament, which makes use of a material element.\n\n"}

{"id": "2269277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269277", "title": "Marguerite Bourgeoys", "text": "Marguerite Bourgeoys\n\nMarguerite Bourgeoys, C.N.D. (17 April 1620–12 January 1700), was a French nun and founder of the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal in the colony of New France, now part of Québec, Canada. Born in Troyes, she traveled to Fort Ville-Marie (now Montreal) by 1653, where she developed the convent and educated young girls, the poor, and children of First Nations until shortly before her death in early 1700. She is also significant for developing one of the first uncloistered religious communities in the Catholic Church. Declared \"venerable\" by the pope in 1878, she was canonized in 1982 and declared a saint by the Catholic Church, the first female saint of Canada.\n\nMarguerite Bourgeoys was born on 17 April 1620 in Troyes, then in the ancient Province of Champagne in the Kingdom of France. The daughter of Abraham Bourgeoys and Guillemette Garnier, she was the seventh of their thirteen children. Marguerite came from a middle-class and socially connected background, as her father was a candle maker and coiner at the royal mint in the town. Her father died when she was very young, and her mother when Marguerite was 19.\n\nAs a girl, Bourgeoys was never much interested in joining the confraternity of the Congregation Notre-Dame attached to the monastery in town. It had been founded in 1597 by the Blessed Alix Le Clerc, C.R.S.A., dedicated to the education of the poor. The canonesses of the monastery helped the poor, but remained cloistered. They were not allowed to teach outside the cloister. To reach poor young girls who could not afford to board within the cloister as students, they relied upon a sodality, whose members they would educate in both religion and pedagogy. Marguerite decided at about age 15 to join the sodality affiliated with the Congregation.\n\nOn 7 October 1640, during a procession in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary, Bourgeoys decided to dedicate herself to the service of God. She supported the education of children (and especially girls), with courage and independence. Given the early deaths of her parents, her life was difficult. Later on, Marguerite became well known as a lecturer.\n\nin 1652 Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, the Governor of the French settlement at Montreal in New France, visited his sister, an Augustinian canoness in Troyes. She directed the sodality to which Bourgeoys belonged. The governor invited Marguerite Bourgeoys to come to Canada and start a school in Ville-Marie (eventually the city of Montreal). \n\nBefore February 1653, Bourgeoys accepted the assignment to set up a congregation and a mission in New France. She set sail on the \"Saint-Nicholas\" from France, along with approximately 100 other colonists, mostly men. They had been recruited and signed to working contracts.\n\nUpon her arrival in the port of Quebec City on the following 22 September, Bourgeoys was offered hospitality with the Ursuline nuns there while transportation to Ville-Marie was arranged. She declined the offer and spent her stay in Quebec living alongside poor settlers. She arrived in Ville-Marie on November 16, 1653.\n\nThe colony was so small that Bourgeoys would have soon come to know practically everyone. There were no children to teach due to the high levels of infant mortality, which frustrated her plan to provide education. She began to help the community in any way she could, often working alongside the settlers.\n\nDuring these early years, Bourgeoys initiated institution building. In 1657 she organized formation of a work party to build Ville-Marie's first permanent church - the Chapel of Our Lady of Good Counsel (). She was provided with a vacant stone stable by de Maisonneuve, founder of Ville Marie, in April 1658 to serve as a schoolhouse for her students. This was the beginning of public schooling in Montreal, which Bourgeoys established five years after arrival. Today a commemorative plaque marks the site of the stable school in Old Montreal. It can be found on a wall just below the southwest corner of Saint-Dizier and Saint-Paul streets.\n\nSoon after receiving the stable, Bourgeoys departed for France to recruit more women to serve as teachers for the colony. She combined this goal with housing and caring for the \"King's Daughters,\" or \"filles du roi\", as they are known in Quebec (orphan girls sent by the Crown to marry and create families in the colony) upon their arrival from Europe. Bourgeoys and her four companions were also responsible for interviewing the male settlers who came to the settlement seeking a wife.\n\nThe small group of women began to follow a religious way of life, establishing periods of common prayer and meals. The women also worked independently in various villages and towns throughout the colony, teaching the local children. During this three-year period, Bourgeoys and her small community sought official recognition and legitimacy from both the Crown and the religious establishment in New France. In 1669, Bourgeoys had an audience with François de Laval, the Apostolic Vicar of New France and its highest religious authority. He ultimately issued an ordinance that gave permission to the congregation Notre-Dame to teach on the entire island of Montreal, as well as anywhere else in the colony that considered their services as necessary. The bishop, however, later tried to draft a Rule of Life for the community that would have imposed enclosure upon them, severely limiting their effectiveness in regional conditions.\n\nIn 1670 Bourgeoys returned to France again, seeking an audience with the King to protect her community from being cloistered. She left with no money or clothing, only with a letter of recommendation by Jean Talon, Royal Intendant of the colony; he praised her great contribution to its future. By May 1671, she had met with Louis XIV, and had obtained letters patent from him that secured the viability of her community in New France as \"secular Sisters\". The French monarch wrote: \"Not only has (Marguerite Bourgeoys) performed the office of schoolmistress by giving free instruction to the young girls in all occupations (...), far from being a liability to the country, she had built permanent buildings (...).\"\n\nHelene Bernier refers to Bourgeoys' work after 1672 as the \"Golden Age\" of the Congregation. During this period, Bourgeoys expanded her work as an educator to serve the growing needs of the colony.\n\nShe established a boarding school at Ville-Marie, so that more affluent girls would not have to travel to Quebec for their education. She also established a school devoted to needle-work and other practical, artisan occupations for women in Pointe-Saint-Charles. Other members of the Congregation founded smaller schools in places such as Lachine, Pointe-aux-Trembles, Batiscan and Champlain. In 1678, Bourgeoys reached out to Catholic Native communities, setting up a small school in the Iroquois village of \"la Montagne\" (Montreal), made up primarily of converted Mohawk and other Iroquois peoples.\n\nIn 1680 Bourgeoys returned again to France, to protect the uncloistered character of her institution and seek additional members. Bishop Laval, also visiting France, forbade her from taking back new recruits. But Canadian-born women began to be recruited into the congregation, which assured the continuation of the work. After Bourgeoys returned to New France, her influence continued to grow in the colony.\n\nDuring the 1680s, the congregation of sisters grew significantly and finally gained a strong foothold in the city of Québec. The new bishop in the colony, Jean-Baptiste De La Croix de Saint-Vallier, was impressed with the vocational school that Bourgeoys had established in Ville-Marie and worked with her to found a similar institution in Quebec. Numerous sisters were brought to Île d'Orléans to help the growing community in that area. In 1692, the congregation opened a school in Quebec that catered to girls from poor families.\n\nAfter announcing that she would step down in 1683, Bourgeoys stayed on as the figurehead of the Congregation until 1693. She gave up daily leadership, but worked to help her sisters retain their characteristic spirit. Bourgeoys and her colleagues kept their secular character despite efforts by Bishop Saint-Vallier to impose a cloistered life by a merger with the Ursulines. On July 1, 1698, the congregation was \"canonically constituted a community\".\n\nDuring her last two years, Bourgeoys devoted her time primarily to prayer and writing her autobiography, of which some remnants have survived. She died in Montreal on 12 January 1700. Her likeness, painted by Pierre Le Ber immediately after her death, portrays the compassion that animated her life. The portrait can be seen in the Marguerite Bourgeoys Museum.\n\nThe day following her death, a priest wrote, \"If saints were canonized as in the past by the voice of the people and of the clergy, tomorrow we would be saying the Mass of Saint Marguerite of Canada.\" Helene Bernier writes, \"[P]opular admiration had already canonized her 250 years before her beatification.\" She was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1982.\n\nNumerous stories related to the time preceding her death. The elderly Sister Bourgeoys was said to have offered her life to God in order to save that of a younger member of the Congregation who had fallen ill. After intense prayer, the young nun was said to be cured, and Marguerite fell terribly ill, dying soon thereafter. After her death, she continued to be admired and highly regarded. The convent held an afternoon visitation open to the public; people treasured objects that they touched to her hands at this time, which became spiritual relics. Her body was kept by the parish of Ville-Marie, but her heart was removed and preserved as a relic by the Congregation.\n\nMarguerite was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1982, and is the first female saint of Canada. The process was begun nearly 100 years before in 1878, when Pope Leo XIII gave her the title of \"venerable\" by papal decree. In November 1950, Pope Pius XII beatified her, giving her the title \"Blessed Marguerite Bourgeoys.\" The two miracles that led to her beatification both involved a miraculous cure from gangrene of the foot, gained by Joseph Descoteaux of St. Celestin, Quebec; and John Ludger Lacroix of St. Johnsbury, Vermont. On 2 April 1982, Pope John Paul II issued the Decree of Miracle for a cure attributed to her intercession. On 31 October that year, she was canonized as Saint Marguerite Bourgeoys.\n\nOn 30 May 1975 Canada Post issued the stamp, 'Marguerite Bourgeoys, 1620-1700', designed by Jacques Roy and based on a painting by Elmina Lachance. The 8¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 x 12 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited. \nOther commemoration includes an all-girls high school named after her in Toronto, Ontario;, and a school commission in the Montreal area. At least two French Catholic elementary schools in Ontario are named École Sainte-Marguerite-Bourgeoys in her honour: one in Merrickville (with a second campus located in Kemptville) and another in Brantford.\nA women's college in Montreal was named after her. In the 1960s it was adapted as a \"Cégep\" (Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel, known in English as CEGEP, a two-year public general and vocational college). It retained its name of 'Collège Marguerite-Bourgeoys' until it closed in the 1990s. The former building on Westmount Avenue is still owned by the Congregation Notre-Dame. Today it is occupied by Marianopolis College, another CEGEP, founded by the English-speaking division of Congregation Notre-Dame.\n\nVarious organizations and locations are named after her, including Marguerite Bourgeoys Park in Montreal, the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, and the Marguerite-Bourgeoys Quebec provincial electoral district. In addition, a Marguerite Bourgeoys Museum is located in Old Montreal. A sculptural representation of Marguerite Bourgeoys stands in Place Marguerite Bourgeois across from the Quebec Court of Appeal and next to the Palais de justice in Old Montreal.\n\n"}

The attempt to assassinate tsar Alexander II failed and Karakozov was executed.\n\nKarakozov was born in the family of a minor nobility in Kostroma. He grew to hate his class because all they did was \"suck the peasants' blood.\" He studied at Kazan University 1861-64 and at Moscow State University 1864-66. He was expelled from both which led to depression and a suicide attempt. In early 1866 he became a member of the \"revolutionary wing\" of the Ishutin Society, founded by his cousin Nikolai Ishutin in Moscow in 1863. \n\nIn the spring of 1866, Karakozov arrived in St Petersburg to assassinate Alexander II. He circulated his hand-written proclamation called \"\"Друзьям-рабочим\"\" (\"To Friends-Workers\"), in which he incited people to revolt. He wrote a manifesto to the St Petersburg governor blaming the Tsar for the suffering of the poor:\n\"I have decided to destroy the evil Tsar, and to die for my beloved people.\" This note never reached anyone; it was lost in the mail.\n\nIt is possible 1866 was the year chosen because of the character of Rakhmetov in \"What Is to Be Done?\". This fictional inspiration of revolutionary youth plans for a revolution to coincide with the apocalypse according to Newton-1866.\n\nOn 4 April 1866, Dmitry Karakozov made an unsuccessful attempt on the life of Tsar Alexander II at the gates of the Summer Garden in St Petersburg. As the Tsar was leaving, Dmitry rushed forward to fire. The attempt was thwarted by Ossip Komissarov, a peasant-born hatter's apprentice, who jostled Karakozov's elbow just before the shot was fired. Contemporary monarchists argued that Komissarov's action proved the people's love for their tsar, while contemporary radicals and later Soviet historians argued that Komissarov's involvement in the event was either an accident or an outright government fabrication. Komissarov was ennobled and given a generous allowance, but proved to be an embarrassment to the government due to his boorishness and incoherence and had to be politely removed to the countryside.\n\nKarakozov tried to flee instead of using the second cartridge in his double-barrelled gun, but was easily caught by the guards. He kept one hand in his jacket. It was revealed later to be holding morphine and strychnine to kill himself and prussic acid to disfigure his face. Alexander asked him \"What do you want?\" \"Nothing, nothing,\" he replied. \n\nKarakozov was taken to the Peter and Paul Fortress. He begged for forgiveness and converted to Russian Orthodoxy. The Supreme Criminal Court sentenced him to death by hanging and he was executed in St. Petersburg on 3 September 1866. Ten of his accomplices were sentenced to hard labor, another 25 were acquitted. As a result of the assassination attempt, the Tsar punished St Petersburg University. Students could no longer form any kind of organisation, no matter how harmless (Ishutin's organisation had officially been to set up sewing cooperatives). They were subjected to constant surveillance and periodic searches.\n\nKarakozov was an inspiration for the radical nihilists Sergei Nechaev and Vera Zasulich. Alexander II was assassinated in 1881.\n\n\n"}

It formed part of the Shubenacadie Canal.\n\nThe pond is located northeast of Halifax Harbour at Dartmouth Cove as part of the Shubenacadie Canal system. It is the first water body in the canal system when heading from the harbour to the Bay of Fundy and was constructed as a holding pond for southbound vessels wishing to transit the remaining distance to the harbour. With an elevation several dozen metres (about 50 ft) higher than the harbour to the south, the pond was linked to the ocean by small inclined marine railway which was used to haul boats to and from Dartmouth Cove. A lock lifted boats from the pond into Lake Banook to the north.\n\nAfter the Shubenacadie Canal was abandoned due to unsustainable competition from the Nova Scotia Railway in the 1860s, Sullivan's Pond fell into disrepair and homes began to surround the pond. The area around Dartmouth Cove south of the pond became industrialized with construction of the Starr Manufacturing ice skate factory and the establishment of a shipyard. Although the pond was uphill and mostly insulated from being polluted by these developments, a general air of neglect surrounded the water body for many decades.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the City of Dartmouth, also known by its nickname \"The City of Lakes\", undertook to restore or clean up the various lakes used in the Shubenacadie Canal system. Today, Sullivan's Pond is part of a park which runs along the southern shores of Lake Banook, providing habitat for water fowl.\n\nSince the 1950s, Dartmouth saw numerous residential developments, including several subdivisions in the area surrounding Lake Banook and Sullivan's Pond. To reestablish public access to the water, the city developed a plan to gradually recover lands adjacent to the lake by purchasing properties as they became available, which resulted in the current park area.\n\nToday, the pond features a small island with a totem pole which was a gift to the city from the province of British Columbia for hosting the 1969 Canada Summer Games. There is also an open-air concert pavilion located near the pond constructed for the city by the Rotary Club of Dartmouth, and the cenotaph is located near the pond.

Blackstone, in a single night of personal spiritual struggle, decided to dedicate his life to God. Renouncing material pursuits, he proclaimed for the balance of his long life, in his preaching as well as in his writing, the premillennial return and rapture of the Church. As he ministered across the U.S., Blackstone spoke with increasing fervor in support of Jewish restorationism.\n\nIn 1878, he wrote, \"Jesus is Coming\". His book became the veritable reference source of American dispensationalist thought. Over the next 50 years, \"Jesus is Coming\" sold multi-millions of copies worldwide and was translated into 48 languages.\n\nHe initially focused on the restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land as a prelude to their conversion to Christianity, out of a pious wish to hasten the coming of the Messiah; but he increasingly became concerned with the deadly, Russian, government-instigated pogroms and believed that it was necessary to create a Jewish homeland in Israel. He was, furthermore, persuaded that neither the European nations nor the United States would accept as many Jews as needed to escape from Europe.\n\nBlackstone and his daughter traveled to the Holy Land in 1888. He returned convinced that a return of the Jewish people to its ancient homeland was the only possible solution to the persecution Jews suffered elsewhere. On November 24–25, 1890, Blackstone organized the Conference on the Past, Present and Future of Israel at the First Methodist Episcopal Church in Chicago where participants included leaders of both Jewish and Christian communities, albeit not leaders of the Reform movement.\n\nThe conference issued a call urging the great powers, including the Ottoman Empire, to return Israel to the Jews. Resolutions of sympathy for the oppressed Jews living in Russia were passed, but Blackstone was convinced that such resolutions – even though passed by prominent men – were insufficient. He advocated strongly for the voluntary resettlement of the Jewish people, suffering under virulent anti-Semitism, in Israel.\n\nA year later in 1891, Blackstone led a petition drive that was approved by the conference. It was later known as the Blackstone Memorial. The memorial was signed by 413 prominent Christian and a few Jewish leaders in the United States. Blackstone personally gathered the signatures of men such as John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Cyrus McCormick, senators, congressmen, religious leaders of all denominations, newspaper editors, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and others for the \"Blackstone Memorial.\" He presented the \"Memorial\" to President Harrison, March 1891, calling for American support of Jewish restoration to Israel. His petition presaged and paralleled the later ideas of Theodor Herzl, the founder of the State of Israel, whose establishment of modern Zionism was outlined in his book, \"Der Judenstaat\", 1896.\n\nThe Blackstone Memorial read, in part: \n\nAlso in 1891, Blackstone stated that, the general \"law of dereliction\" did not apply to the Jews in regard to Palestine: \n\nLearning of the rise of the Zionist movement, led by Theodor Herzl, Blackstone became an outspoken and ardent supporter of Zionism. When Herzlian Zionism considered the offer by the British government of an interim Jewish state in Uganda he campaigned against it. He sent to Herzl a personal Bible outlined with the specific biblical references to Jewish restoration to Israel only. The Bible was said to have been prominently displayed on Herzl's desk for many years. It is no longer locatable.\n\nIn 1904, he began teaching that the world has already been evangelized, citing Acts 2:5, 8:4, Mark 16:20 and Colossians 1:23. As one of the most popular evangelists in the United States, he traveled extensively continuing to spread the gospel until his death 31 years later.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis rediscovered the Blackstone Memorial in 1916 during the period of his raucous, at times anti-Semitic, Congressional appointment hearings. Brandeis, as head of the American Zionist movement, utilizing the intercession of Nathan Straus who first brought Brandeis's attention to the potential significance of the \"Blackstone Memorial of 1891\", sought out and formed an alliance with Blackstone.\n\nNathan Straus wrote to Reverend Blackstone, May 16, 1916, on behalf of Brandeis:\n“Mr. Brandeis is perfectly infatuated with the work that you have done along the lines of Zionism. It would have done your heart good to have heard him assert what a valuable contribution to the cause your document is. In fact he agrees with me that you are the Father of Zionism, as your work antedates Herzl\".\n\nBrandeis requested that Blackstone reissue a \"modern Blackstone Memorial\" to President Wilson. Brandeis understood the fundamentals of power politics and grassroots American Christian and American political support. Brandeis understood the support that Blackstone would raise for the \"Memorial\" would enable President Wilson to accept and endorse American Zionism and the later British Balfour Declaration of 1917, which set the course for the establishment of the State of Israel. Though 75 years of age, Reverend Blackstone energetically undertook the strenuous project. Of particular note, Blackstone secured the endorsement of his Memorial to President Wilson from the Presbyterian Church. President Wilson was a religiously observant Presbyterian. The Memorial, though presented to President Wilson only privately, was very effective in garnering President Wilson's support and in turn reassuring the British of American support for the Balfour Declaration. The Blackstone Memorial of 1916, unlike the Memorial of 1891, was never publicly presented.\n\nBlackstone remained committed to Jewish restoration and Zionism for the balance of his long life. As a believing Evangelical Christian, he witnessed the seeming fulfillment of biblical prophecy as the Jewish state came back to life after 1900 years. Blackstone died thirteen years before Israel was founded in 1948. Without Rev. Blackstone's lifelong efforts to build American political support and American prophetic understanding of dispensationalism and restorationism, American support for Zionism and the State of Israel might have been very different. Famous during his life, he slipped into historical obscurity.\n\nReverend Blackstone died on November 7, 1935. He was buried in a modest grave at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California. All his evangelical life, Blackstone described himself as \"God's Little Errand Boy.\"\n\n"}

In his later years, Bell often played characters having a sinister side to their nature.\n\nBell was born on 2 August 1933 in Liverpool, Lancashire, England. Evacuated as a child during the Second World War, he lived with three different families in Morecambe, Lancashire. In 1948, at age 15, Bell began to act in his first school plays. His younger brother Keith also became an actor.\n\nOn leaving school he trained under Esme Church at the Bradford Civic Theatre; fellow pupils included Billie Whitelaw and Robert Stephens. He later worked in repertory in Liverpool and Dublin.\n\nBell made his first film appearances in so-called \"Kitchen Sink Dramas\", including \"The Kitchen\" (1961) and \"The L-Shaped Room\" (1962), with Leslie Caron.\n\nAs a young actor, he gained somewhat of a reputation for being a hellraiser who liked a drink. At an awards ceremony, drunk, he interrupted a speech by the guest of honour, Prince Philip, by yelling \"Tell us a funny story\" – to the obvious embarrassment of table companions, Richard Attenborough and Bryan Forbes. Although (it is said) the Prince took the heckle in good humour with his retort \"If you want a funny story, I suggest you engage a professional comic\", the incident didn't do Bell's career any favours. In 1978, he came to worldwide attention portraying Adolf Eichmann in the Emmy-winning tv-series \"Holocaust\", and he received a BAFTA nomination for the series \"Out\", in which he played convicted armed robber, Frank Ross.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, he appeared in several British films including \"Wish You Were Here\", Peter Greenaway's \"Prospero's Books\", \"Swing\" and the 1990 film \"The Krays\", where he played the part of Jack \"The Hat\" McVitie, one of the Kray twins' murder victims.\n\nHe played the dour owner of a run-down seaside waxworks museum in Thames tv's sitcom \"Hope It Rains\", written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey and directed by John Howard Davies. There were two series (13 episodes in all) aired in 1991–92.\n\nAlthough he tended to eschew live performance, his few stage appearances included a rôle in the 1979 UK première of \"Bent\", Martin Sherman's play about homosexuality, staged at the Royal Court Theatre. He played the character Horst opposite Ian McKellen's Max. The play's setting of homosexuals and love in a Nazi death camp was shocking for many theatregoers at the time and uncovered a previously little-examined area of Nazi brutality.\n\nBell played a policeman Detective Sergeant Bill Otley opposite Helen Mirren in the first and third series of the ITV series \"Prime Suspect\". In 1993, in the third series, he received his second BAFTA nomination. One of his final screen appearances was a supporting role in 2006 in the seventh: \"Prime Suspect: The Final Act\".\n\nBell's first marriage, from 1960 to 1976, was to the actress Lois Daine. They had one son, Aran, who became an actor. By his partner Frances Tempest, he had a daughter.\n\nBell had enjoyed working with TV director Danny Hiller. When his friend and adviser, showbiz accountant Jose Goumal (also a close friend and adviser to Hiller) asked Bell, he agreed to appear in Hiller's first feature film \"Love Me Still\". It was evident throughout filming that he was not well but he soldiered on and completed filming only a few days before the end of his life. He died in hospital in Brighton on 4 October 2006, aged 73, following a short illness. \n\n\n"}

It is a chorale cantata, based on the hymn \"\" by Paul Speratus. Bach composed the cantata to fill a gap in his chorale cantata cycle written for performances in Leipzig from 1724.\n\nThe cantata is structured in seven movements, framed as the earlier chorale cantatas by a chorale fantasia and a chorale four-part setting, of the first and the twelfth stanza in the original words by the reformer Speratus, published in the First Lutheran hymnal. The theme is salvation from sin by God's grace alone. An anonymous librettist paraphrased the content of ten inner stanzas to alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for a chamber ensemble of four vocal parts, flauto traverso, oboe d'amore, strings and continuo. He gave all three recitatives to the bass, like a sermon interrupted in reflection by a tenor aria with solo violin and a duet of soprano and alto with the wind instruments.\nBach composed the cantata for the Sixth Sunday after Trinity between 1732 and 1735. It filled a gap in his second annual cycle of chorale cantatas written for performance in Leipzig. In 1724, when he composed the cycle, he had an engagement in Köthen that Sunday, and therefore left the text for later completion. The cantata is based on a hymn \"\" by Paul Speratus, which was published in 1524 in the , the first Lutheran hymnal. The theme of the chorale is the Lutheran creed of salvation from sin by God's grace alone (justification by faith), summarized in the first stanza: \"Deeds can never help, ... faith beholds Jesus Christ, ... He has become the Intercessor\".\n\nThe prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans, \"By Christ's death we are dead for sin\" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew a passage from the Sermon on the Mount about better justice than the justice of merely observing laws and rules (). The hymn in 14 stanzas matches the topic of the gospel. An unknown poet transformed the first 12 stanzas of the chorale to seven cantata movements. Dropping the last two stanzas, the librettist retains the first stanza as the first movement, and the 12th as the last movement. He rephrased stanzas 2–4 to a recitative (2), stanzas 5–7 to a recitative (4), stanzas 9–11 to a third recitative (6). Ideas from stanza 8 were made an aria (5), and movement 3 is not derived directly from the chorale, but intensifies the conclusion of the first recitative. The three recitatives can be considered a sermon, according to Julian Mincham, who comments: \"All three speak of God's Laws; their bestowal, their fulfillment (or lack of it) and our attitudes towards them\", and who summarizes: \"The three recitatives were clearly planned as a cognate group and encapsulate the fundamental Lutheran creed. The two intervening arias, and finally the chorale, reflect upon and extend their statements.\" The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff assumes that the text was already written for Bach's 1724 cycle of chorale cantatas by the same librettist.\n\nBach had used selected stanzas of the hymn before, in 1716 stanza 12 to conclude , in 1723 both stanza 12 and 11 to conclude the two parts of , and in 1724 stanza 11 to conclude .\n\nBach structured the cantata in seven movements, framing by a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. He scored it for a chamber music ensemble of four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, flauto traverso (Ft), oboe d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), one of them solo (Vs), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).

The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.\n\nThe opening chorus, \"\" (It is our salvation come here to us), is a chorale fantasia, the vocal part embedded in a concerto of the instruments. The cantus firmus of the chorale melody is in the soprano in unadorned long notes, while the lower voices engage in imitation. The scoring with the obbligato instruments flute and oboe d'amore in contrast to the strings is unusual, sometimes the first violin takes also part in the concerto.\n\n\"\" (God gave us the Law), is the first of three recitatives which are sung by the bass as the (voice of Christ), almost like one sermon, which is only deepened by the two arias in between. The recitatives are secco with the only exception of the final line of movement 4, \"\" (... embrace the arms of Jesus), which is rendered arioso, in \"an enlightening major key, a tender vocal phrase and the late semi-quaver continuo line\".\n\nThe tenor aria depicts the \"sinking\" of \"\" (We were already too deeply sunk) in downward motifs and an irregular rhythm of syncopes, observed by Dürr as an image of \"a giddy descent into the abyss of sin\".\n\nThe bass continues the \"sermon\", \"\" (Yet the Law must be fulfilled).\n\nThe duet \"\" (Lord, you see, instead of good works) is set for five parts of equal weight, the soprano and alto voices, flute, oboe d'amore and continuo, in intricate canonic counterpoint in da capo form.\n\nThe bass continues the \"sermon\" a third time, \"\" (When we recognize our sin against the Law).\n\nThe closing chorale, \"\" (Although it appears that He does not will it), is set for four parts.

{"id": "2269319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269319", "title": "Battle of Ceresole", "text": "Battle of Ceresole\n\nThe Battle of Ceresole (or Cérisoles) took place on 11 April 1544, during the Italian War of 1542–46, outside the village of Ceresole d'Alba in the Piedmont region of Italy. A French army, commanded by François de Bourbon, Count of Enghien, defeated the combined forces of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain, commanded by Alfonso d'Avalos d'Aquino, Marquis del Vasto. Despite having inflicted substantial casualties on the Imperial troops, the French subsequently failed to exploit their victory by taking Milan.\n\nEnghien and d'Avalos had arranged their armies along two parallel ridges; because of the topography of the battlefield, many of the individual actions of the battle were uncoordinated. The battle opened with several hours of skirmishing between opposing bands of arquebusiers and an ineffectual artillery exchange, after which d'Avalos ordered a general advance. In the center, Imperial landsknechts clashed with French and Swiss infantry, with both sides suffering terrific casualties. In the southern part of the battlefield, Italian infantry in Imperial service were harried by French cavalry attacks and withdrew after learning that the Imperial troops of the center had been defeated. In the north, meanwhile, the French infantry line crumbled, and Enghien led a series of ineffectual and costly cavalry charges against Spanish and German infantry before the latter were forced to surrender by the arrival of the victorious Swiss and French infantry from the center.\n\nCeresole was one of the few pitched battles during the latter half of the Italian Wars. Known among military historians chiefly for the \"great slaughter\" that occurred when columns of intermingled arquebusiers and pikemen met in the center, it also demonstrates the continuing role of traditional heavy cavalry on a battlefield largely dominated by the emerging pike and shot infantry.\n\nThe opening of the war in northern Italy had been marked by the fall of Nice to a combined Franco-Ottoman army in August 1543; meanwhile, Imperial-Spanish forces had advanced from Lombardy towards Turin, which had been left in French hands at the end of the previous war in 1538. By the winter of 1543–1544, a stalemate had developed in the Piedmont between the French, under the Sieur de Boutières, and the Imperial army, under d'Avalos. The French position, centered on Turin, reached outward to a series of fortified towns: Pinerolo, Carmagnola, Savigliano, Susa, Moncalieri, Villanova, Chivasso, and a number of others; d'Avalos, meanwhile, controlled a group of fortresses on the periphery of the French territory: Mondovì, Asti, Casale Monferrato, Vercelli, and Ivrea. The two armies occupied themselves primarily with attacking each other's outlying strongholds. Boutières seized San Germano Vercellese, near Vercelli, and laid siege to Ivrea; d'Avalos, meanwhile, captured Carignano, only fifteen miles south of Turin, and proceeded to garrison and fortify it.\n\nAs the two armies returned to winter quarters, Francis I of France replaced Boutières with François de Vendôme, Count of Enghien, a prince with no experience commanding an army. Francis also sent additional troops to the Piedmont, including several hundred heavy cavalry, some companies of French infantry from Dauphiné and Languedoc, and a force of quasi-Swiss from Gruyères. In January 1544, Enghien laid siege to Carignano, which was defended by Imperial troops under the command of Pirro Colonna. The French were of the opinion that d'Avalos would be forced to attempt a relief of the besieged city, at which point he could be forced into a battle; but as such pitched battles were viewed as very risky undertakings, Enghien sent Blaise de Lasseran-Massencôme, seigneur de Montluc, to Paris to ask Francis for permission to fight one. Montluc apparently convinced Francis to give his assent—contingent on the agreement of Enghien's captains—over the objections of the Comte de St. Pol, who complained that a defeat would leave France exposed to an invasion by d'Avalos's troops at a time when Charles V and Henry VIII of England were expected to attack Picardy. Montluc, returning to Italy, brought with him nearly a hundred volunteers from among the young noblemen of the court, including Gaspard de Coligny.\n\nD'Avalos, having waited for the arrival a large body of landsknechts dispatched by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, set off from Asti towards Carignano. His total force included 12,500–18,000 infantry, of which perhaps 4,000 were arquebusiers or musketeers; he was only able to gather about 800–1,000 cavalry, of which less than 200 were gendarmes. D'Avalos recognized the relative weakness of his cavalry, but considered it to be compensated by the experience of his infantry and the large number of arquebusiers in its ranks.\n\nEnghien, having learned of the Imperial advance, left a blocking force at Carignano and assembled the remainder of his army at Carmagnola, blocking d'Avalos's route to the besieged city. The French cavalry, shadowing d'Avalos's movements, discovered that the Imperial forces were headed directly for the French position; on 10 April, d'Avalos occupied the village of Ceresole d'Alba, about five miles (8 km) southeast of the French. Enghien's officers urged him to attack immediately, but he was determined to fight on ground of his own choosing; on the morning of 11 April 1544, the French marched from Carmagnola to a position some three miles (5 km) to the southeast and awaited d'Avalos's arrival. Enghien and Montluc felt that the open ground would give the French cavalry a significant tactical advantage. By this point, the French army consisted of around 11,000–13,000 infantry, 600 light cavalry, and 900–1,250 heavy cavalry; Enghien and d'Avalos each had about twenty pieces of artillery. The battle came at a fortunate time for Enghien, as his Swiss troops were—as they had before the Battle of Bicocca—threatening to march home if they were not paid; the news of the impending battle restored some calm to their ranks.\n\nEnghien's troops were positioned along the crest of a ridge that was higher in the center than on either side, preventing the wings of the French army from seeing each other. The French army was divided into the traditional \"battle\", \"vanward\", and \"rearward\" corps, corresponding to the center and right and left wings of the French line. On the far right of the French position was a body of light cavalry, consisting of three companies under Des Thermes, Bernadino, and Mauré, with a total strength of around 450–500 men. To their left was the French infantry under De Tais, numbering around 4,000, and, farther to the left, a squadron of 80 gendarmes under Boutières, who was nominally the commander of the entire French right wing. The center of the French line was formed by thirteen companies of veteran Swiss, numbering about 4,000, under the joint command of William Frülich of Soleure and a captain named St. Julian. To their left was Enghien himself with three companies of heavy cavalry, a company of light horse, and the volunteers from Paris—in total, around 450 troopers. The left wing was composed of two columns of infantry, consisting of 3,000 of the recruits from Gruyères and 2,000 Italians, all under the command of Sieur Descroz. On the extreme left of the line were about 400 mounted archers deployed as light cavalry; they were commanded by Dampierre, who was also given command of the entire French left wing.\n\nThe Imperial line formed up on a similar ridge facing the French position. On the far left, facing Des Thermes, were 300 Florentine light cavalry under Rodolfo Baglioni; flanking them to the right were 6,000 Italian infantry under Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno. In the center were the 7,000 landsknechte under the command of Eriprando Madruzzo. To their right was d'Avalos himself, together with the small force of about 200 heavy cavalry under Carlo Gonzaga. The Imperial right wing was composed of around 5,000 German and Spanish infantry under Ramón de Cardona; they were flanked, on the far right, by 300 Italian light cavalry under Philip de Lannoy, Prince of Sulmona.\n\nAs d'Avalos's troops, marching from Ceresole, began to arrive on the battlefield, both armies attempted to conceal their numbers and position from the other; Enghien had ordered the Swiss to lie on the ground behind the crest of the ridge, while only the left wing of the Imperial army was initially visible to the French. D'Avalos sent out parties of arquebusiers in an attempt to locate the French flanks; Enghien, in turn, detached about 800 arquebusiers under Montluc to delay the Imperial advance. The skirmishing between the arquebusiers continued for almost four hours; Martin Du Bellay, observing the engagement, described it as \"a pretty sight for anyone who was in a safe place and unemployed, for they played off on each other all the ruses and stratagems of petty war.\" As the extent of each army's position was revealed, Enghien and d'Avalos both brought up their artillery. The ensuing cannonade continued for several hours, but had little effect because of the distance and the considerable cover available to the troops on both sides.\n\nThe skirmishing finally came to an end when it seemed that Imperial cavalry would attack the French arquebusiers in the flank; Montluc then requested assistance from Des Thermes, who advanced with his entire force of light cavalry. D'Avalos, observing the French movement, ordered a general advance along the entire Imperial line. At the southern end of the battlefield, the French light cavalry drove Baglioni's Florentines back into Sanseverino's advancing infantry, and then proceeded to charge directly into the infantry column. The Italian formation held, and Des Thermes himself was wounded and captured; but by the time Sanseverino had dealt with the resulting disorder and was ready to advance again, the fight in the center had already been decided.\n\nThe French infantry—mostly Gascons—had meanwhile started down the slope towards Sanseverino. Montluc, noting that the disorder of the Italians had forced them to a standstill, suggested that De Tais attack Madruzzo's advancing column of landsknechte instead; this advice was accepted, and the French formation turned left in an attempt to strike the landsknechte in the flank. Madruzzo responded by splitting his column into two separate portions, one of which moved to intercept the French while the other continued up the slope towards the Swiss waiting at the crest.\n\nThe pike and shot infantry had by this time adopted a system in which arquebusiers and pikemen were intermingled in combined units; both the French and the Imperial infantry contained men with firearms interspersed in the larger columns of pikemen. This combination of pikes and small arms made close-quarters fighting extremely bloody. The mixed infantry was normally placed in separate clusters, with the arquebusiers on the flanks of a central column of pikemen; at Ceresole, however, the French infantry had been arranged with the first rank of pikemen followed immediately by a rank of arquebusiers, who were ordered to hold their fire until the two columns met. Montluc, who claimed to have devised the scheme, wrote that: In this way we should kill all their captains in the front rank. But we found that they were as ingenious as ourselves, for behind their first line of pikes they had put pistoleers. Neither side fired till we were touching—and then there was a wholesale slaughter: every shot told: the whole front rank on each side went down. The Swiss, seeing the French engage one of the two columns of landsknechte, finally descended to meet the other, which had been slowly moving up the hillside. Both masses of infantry remained locked in a push of pike until the squadron of heavy cavalry under Boutières charged into the landsknechts' flank, shattering their formation and driving them down the slope. The Imperial heavy cavalry, which had been on the landsknechts' right, and which had been ordered by d'Avalos to attack the Swiss, recoiled from the pikes and fled to the rear, leaving Carlo Gonzaga to be taken prisoner.\n\nThe Swiss and Gascon infantry proceeded to slaughter the remaining landsknechte—whose tight order precluded a rapid retreat—as they attempted to withdraw from the battlefield. The road to Ceresole was littered with corpses; the Swiss, in particular, showed no mercy, as they wished to avenge the mistreatment of the Swiss garrison of Mondovì the previous November. Most of the landsknechts' officers were killed; and while contemporary accounts probably exaggerate the numbers of the dead, it is clear that the German infantry had ceased to exist as a fighting force. Seeing this, Sanseverino decided that the battle was lost and marched away to Asti with the bulk of the Italian infantry and the remnants of Baglioni's Florentine cavalry; the French light cavalry, meanwhile, joined in the pursuit of the landsknechts.\n\nOn the northern end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, out of sight of the rest of the battlefield.\n\nOn the first charge, Enghien's cavalry penetrated a corner of the Imperial formation, pushing through to the rear and losing some of the volunteers from Paris. As Cardona's ranks closed again, the French cavalry turned and made a second charge under heavy arquebus fire; this was far more costly, and again failed to break the Imperial column. Enghien, now joined by Dampierre's light cavalry, made a third charge, which again failed to achieve a decisive result; fewer than a hundred of the French gendarmes remained afterwards. Enghien believed the battle to be lost—according to Montluc, he intended to stab himself, \"which ancient Romans might do, but not good Christians\"—when St. Julian, the Swiss commander, arrived from the center of the battlefield and reported that the Imperial forces there had been routed.\n\nThe news of the landsknechts' defeat reached Cardona's troops at about the same time that it had reached Enghien; the Imperial column turned and retreated back towards its original position. Enghien followed closely with the remainder of his cavalry; he was soon reinforced by a company of Italian mounted arquebusiers, which had been stationed at Racconigi and had started towards the battlefield after hearing the initial artillery exchange. These arquebusiers, dismounting to fire and then remounting, were able to harass the Imperial column sufficiently to slow its retreat. Meanwhile, the French and Swiss infantry of the center, having reached Ceresole, had turned about and returned to the battlefield; Montluc, who was with them, writes: When we heard at Ceresole that M. d'Enghien wanted us, both the Swiss and we Gascons turned toward him—I never saw two battalions form up so quick—we got into rank again actually as we ran along, side by side. The enemy was going off at quick march, firing salvos of arquebuses, and keeping off our horse, when we saw them. And when they descried us only 400 paces away, and our cavalry making ready to charge, they threw down their pikes and surrendered to the horsemen. You might see fifteen or twenty of them round a man-at-arms, pressing about him and asking for quarter, for fear of us of the infantry, who were wanting to cut all their throats. Perhaps as many as half of the Imperial infantry were killed as they were attempting to surrender; the remainder, about 3,150 men, were taken prisoner. A few, including the Baron of Seisneck, who had commanded the German infantry contingents, managed to escape.\n\nThe casualties of the battle were unusually high, even by the standards of the time, and are estimated at 28 percent of the total number of troops engaged. The smallest numbers given for the Imperial dead in contemporary accounts are between 5,000 and 6,000, although some French sources give figures as high as 12,000. A large number of officers were killed, particularly among the landsknechts; many of those who survived were taken prisoner, including Ramón de Cardona, Carlo Gonzaga, and Eriprando Madruzzo. The French casualties were smaller, but numbered at least 1,500 to 2,000 killed. These included many of the officers of the Gascon and Gruyères infantry contingents, as well as a large portion of the gendarmerie that had followed Enghien. The only French prisoner of note was Des Thermes, who had been carried along with Sanseverino's retreating Italians.\n\nDespite the collapse of the Imperial army, the battle proved to be of little strategic significance. At the insistence of Francis I, the French army resumed the siege of Carignano, where Colonna held out for several weeks. Soon after the city's surrender, Enghien was forced to send twenty-three companies of Italian and Gascon infantry—and nearly half his heavy cavalry—to Picardy, which had been invaded by Charles V. Left without a real army, Enghien was unable to capture Milan. D'Avalos, meanwhile, routed a fresh force of Italian infantry under Pietro Strozzi and the Count of Pitigliano at the Battle of Serravalle. The end of the war saw a return to the status quo in northern Italy.\n\nA number of detailed contemporary accounts of the battle have survived. Among the French chronicles are the narratives of Martin Du Bellay and Blaise de Montluc, both of whom were present at the scene. The Sieur de Tavannes, who accompanied Enghien, also makes some mention of the events in his memoirs. The most extensive account from the Imperial side is that of Paolo Giovio. Despite a number of inconsistencies with other accounts, it provides, according to historian Charles Oman, \"valuable notes on points neglected by all the French narrators\".\n\nThe interest of modern military historians in the battle has centered primarily on the role of small arms and the resulting carnage among the infantry in the center. The arrangement of pikemen and arquebusiers used was regarded as too costly, and was not tried again; in subsequent battles, arquebuses were used primarily for skirmishing and from the flanks of larger formations of pikemen. Ceresole is also of interest as a demonstration of the continuing role of traditional heavy cavalry on the battlefield. Despite the failure of Enghien's charges—the French, according to Bert Hall, held to their belief in \"the effectiveness of unaided heavy cavalry to break disciplined formations\"—a small body of gendarmes had been sufficient, in the center, to rout infantry columns that were already engaged with other infantry. Beyond this tactical utility, another reason for cavalry's continued importance is evident from the final episode of the battle: the French gendarmes were the only troops who could reasonably be expected to accept an opponent's surrender, as the Swiss and French infantry had no inclination towards taking prisoners. The cavalry was, according to Hall, \"almost intuitively expected to heed these entreaties without question\".\n\n\n"}

He sold off his possessions in order to give to the poor, but was arrested and tortured for his Christian faith during the persecution of the Roman emperor Decius (r. 249–51). He was believed to have died a martyr's death during the persecution of Decius or Valerian (ca. 253), but is now listed in the General Roman Calendar as a confessor of the faith, who survived his tortures.\n\nFelix was the elder son of Hermias, a Syrian centurion who had retired to Nola, Italy. After his father's death Felix sold off most of his property and possessions, gave the proceeds to the poor, and pursued a clerical vocation. Felix was ordained by, and worked with, Saint Maximus of Nola.\n\nWhen bishop Maximus fled to the mountains to escape the persecution of the Roman emperor Decius, Felix was arrested and beaten for his faith instead. He escaped prison, according to legend being freed by an angel, so that he could help bishop Maximus. Felix found Maximus alone, ill, and helpless, and hid him from soldiers in a vacant building. When the two were safely inside, a spider quickly spun a web over the door, fooling the imperial forces into thinking it was long abandoned, and they left without finding the Christians. A subsequent attempt to arrest Felix followed, which he avoided by hiding in a ruined building where again spider web was spun across the entrance convinced the soldiers the building was abandoned. The two managed to hide from authorities until the persecution ended with the death of Emperor Decius in 251.\n\nAfter Maximus's death, the people wanted Felix to be the next bishop of Nola, but he declined, favoring Quintus, a \"senior\" priest who had seven days more experience than Felix. Felix himself continued as a priest. He also continued to farm his remaining land, and gave most of the proceeds to people even poorer than himself.\n\nLegend assigns to Felix a martyr's death either in the year 255 under Emperor Valerian (253–260) or, in another version, in the general persecution instigated by the Emperor Decius (249-251). According to Butler, Felix died in a good old age, on the fourteenth of January.\nMuch of the little information we have about Felix comes from the letters and poetry of Saint Paulinus of Nola, re. When at length peace was obtained, he returned home and in poverty lived a withdrawn life until old age, an unconquered confessor of the faith\".\n\nFive churches have been built at, or near the place, where he was first interred, which was without the precincts of the city of Nola. His precious remains are kept in the cathedral; but certain portions are at Rome, Benevento, and some other places. In time a new church in Nola was dedicated in the name of St Felix. People travelled from far away to see the burial place of this revered saint.\n\nHe should not be confused with another Saint Felix of Nola, of about a century later, whose feast is on 15 November\n\n"}

During the course of its 22-year career through 1993, it played concerts in all fifty states and throughout Europe, the Orient, the Middle East, Central America and Canada. The ensemble earned an international reputation for its dedication to excellence in the presentation of brass chamber music.\n\nThe original members of the quintet were trumpeters Cran and Haldon \"Butch\" Johnson, trombonists Posten and John Driver, and horn player Rick Rightnour. Through 1993, 14 different musicians played as regular members, including future social scientist Arthur C. Brooks. At that time, the Quintet disbanded, and played again only for a single concert in December 2000 in Annapolis, Maryland to honor the late jazz guitar legend Charlie Byrd. The final roster in 1993 and at the reunion concert were Cran, Posten, trumpeter Robert Suggs, trombonist Wayne Wells, and horn player Sharon Tiebert, the only female member in the Quintet's history.\n\nThe Quintet is notable for its founding of the International Brass Quintet Festival in Baltimore, Maryland, which became recognized as a major forum for brass chamber music. A major highlight of the 1989 festival was the combined appearance of both the East Berlin and West Berlin Brass Quintets with the ABQ two months before the Berlin Wall toppled, a historic collaboration both musically and politically. The festival presented over 200 free public concerts and conducted workshops and seminars for students and professional brass players.\n\nIn 1985, the ABQ first performed with the Charlie Byrd Trio as Byrd and Brass. This unique and critically acclaimed blending of Latin, jazz and classical styles, with one of the world's premier jazz guitarists and his trio, led to a long collaboration including over 50 concerts throughout the United States, Christmas concerts in Annapolis, and two recordings, Byrd and Brass and Christmas with Byrd and Brass.\n\nThe Quintet made a strong commitment to expanding the repertoire for the medium and has a list of over seventy-five world premieres to its credit. Among the composers who have written works for the ensemble are Douglas Allanbrook, Michael Brown, Bruce Clausen, George Heussenstamm, Warren Kellerhouse, Jiri Laburda, Robert Hall Lewis, Allen Molineux, Lawrence Moss, Jiri Pauer, Karl Pilss, Walter Ross, Jerzy Sapieyevski, Elam Sprenkle, Robert Starer, George Walker and Robert Washburn. Of special interest are four compositions for quintet and orchestra composed for the ABQ and performed with the Baltimore Symphony, the Bavarian Radio Orchestra, the Stuttgart Philharmonic, the Wichita Symphony and the Dublin Radio Orchestra.\n\nUnited States Senator Barbara Mikulski congratulated the Annapolis Brass Quintet for the national record on the floor of the United States Senate on April 27, 1993, on the occasion of their final concert on April 25, and in recognition of the \"contributions that the Annapolis Brass Quintet has made to brass chamber music. During its 22-year history, it has entertained people around the world and has positively influenced the development of its genre. Its members have achieved a truly high standard of artistic excellence and, together, represent what is best in American music.\"\n\n\n"}

He served briefly as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1846 under Sir Robert Peel.\n\nSmythe was born in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of Percy Smythe, 6th Viscount Strangford, by Ellen Burke, daughter of Sir Thomas Burke, Bt. He attended Tonbridge School and Eton College, and was later admitted to St John's College, Cambridge.\n\nSmythe's father had been Disraeli's friend during the 1830s, and had sponsored the latter for the Carlton Club (along with Lord Chandos). The younger Smythe believed in the sort of romantic Toryism espoused by Lord John Manners. Both of them were heavily influenced by Frederick Faber, an apostle of John Henry Newman, leader of the Oxford Movement. Disraeli and Smythe had known each other through the latter's father since an early age, but it was in the House of Commons that the two became close. Smythe sat as a Member of Parliament for Canterbury from 1841 until 1852, when he was defeated. Along with Disraeli, Manners, and Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, they comprised \"Young England\", a sect of the Conservative Party which, in espousing a romantic Toryism, was often at odds with the moderate, business-like administration of then-Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel.\nYoung England finally splintered over the Maynooth Grant. In 1845 Peel proposed to increase the annual subsidy granted to the Catholic seminary at Maynooth, in Ireland. Smythe, possibly under pressure from his father, supported Peel, as did Lord John Manners. Disraeli, then in open rebellion against Peel, opposed the grant. Lord Blake, Disraeli's biographer, noted that Disraeli's speech was \"essentially \"ad hominem\"\" and that Disraeli had a \"poor case.\" In January 1846 Smythe accepted minor office in Peel's government as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Nevertheless, Smythe and Disraeli apparently remained close friends until the former's death. The title character in Disraeli's novel \"Coningsby\" was modeled after Smythe, and Smythe wrote to Disraeli in 1852 that \"you were of old the Cid and Captain of my boyish fanaticism.\" \n\nLike his father, Smythe had literary tastes. In 1844 he wrote \"Historic Fancies\", a collection of poems and essays, and his novel \"Angelo Pisani\" was published posthumously, with a memoir of the author in 1875.\n\nSmythe's career was shattered later in 1846 when he was caught in a summerhouse with the 21-year-old Lady Dorothy Walpole the daughter of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford. Newspaper gossip alleged that he got her pregnant, and then refused to marry her. Lady Dorothy was hastily married off to an elderly cousin. In the nineteenth century social and political ruin often went hand-in-hand. At his last electoral appearance in 1852 Smythe fought a duel with his fellow MP, Colonel Romilly (the last such encounter in England), and lost election in a landslide.\n\nSmythe succeeded to his father's peerage in 1855 and died 27 November 1857 at the relatively young age of 39 at Bradgate House, Groby, Leicestershire. His title passed to his younger brother, Percy Smythe, 8th Viscount Strangford.\n\n\n \n"}

Episcopal conferences have long existed as informal entities. The first assembly of bishops to meet regularly, with its own legal structure and ecclesial leadership function, is the Swiss Bishops' Conference, which was founded in 1863. More than forty episcopal conferences existed before the Second Vatican Council. Their status was confirmed by the Second Vatican Council and further defined by Pope Paul VI's 1966 \"motu proprio\", \"Ecclesiae sanctae\". \n\nEpiscopal conferences are generally defined by geographic borders, often national ones, with all the bishops in a given country belonging to the same conference, although they may also include neighboring countries. Certain authority and tasks are assigned to episcopal conferences, particularly with regard to setting the liturgical norms for the Mass. Episcopal conferences receive their authority under universal law or particular mandates. In certain circumstances, as defined by canon law, the decisions of an episcopal conference are subject to ratification from the Holy See. Individual bishops do not relinquish their immediate authority for the governance of their respective dioceses to the conference.\n\nThe operation, authority, and responsibilities of episcopal conferences are currently governed by the 1983 Code of Canon Law (see especially canons 447-459) In addition, there are assemblies of bishops which include the bishops of different rites in a nation, both Eastern Catholic and Latin Catholic; these are described in canon 322 §2 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.\n\nThe nature of episcopal conferences, and their magisterial authority in particular, was subsequently clarified by Pope John Paul II in his 1998 \"motu proprio\", \"Apostolos suos\", which stated that the declarations of such conferences \"constitute authentic magisterium\" when approved unanimously by the conference; otherwise the conference must achieve a two-thirds majority and seek the , that is, recognition of approval, of the Holy See, which they will not receive if the majority \"is not substantial\".\n\nIn the 2013 apostolic exhortation, \"Evangelii Gaudium\", Pope Francis expressed his concern that the intent of the Second Vatican Council, which would give episcopal conferences \"genuine doctrinal authority, has not yet been sufficiently elaborated.\" On September 9, 2017, Pope Francis modified canon law, granting episcopal conferences specific authority \"to faithfully prepare … approve and publish the liturgical books for the regions for which they are responsible after the confirmation of the Apostolic See.\" The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, which formerly had primary responsibility for translations, was ordered to \"help the Episcopal Conferences to fulfil their task.\" On October 22, 2017, the Holy See released a letter that Pope Francis had sent to the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Cardinal Robert Sarah, clarifying that the Holy See and its departments would have only limited authority to confirm liturgical translations recognized by a local episcopal conference. In late February, 2018, the Council of Cardinals and Pope Francis undertook a consideration of the theological status of episcopal conferences, re-reading Pope John Paul II's \"Apostolos Suos\" in the light of Pope Francis's \"Evangelii Gaudium\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the episcopal conferences as defined by the Holy See, there are a number of other regional groupings of bishops:\n\nSynods of Bishops of the Patriarchal and Major Archiepiscopal Churches\n\n\nNational assemblies of Hierarchs of Churches Sui Iuris (including eastern Catholic as well as Latin ordinaries)\n\n\n\n\n"}

Halfway down this corridor a suite of unfinished rooms (perhaps intended for Nefertiti). The main corridor continues to descend, and to the right again a second suite of rooms branches off.\n\nThe corridor then descends via steps into an ante-room, and then to the pillared burial chamber where his granite sarcophagus sat in a slight dip in the floor. It was decorated by carvings of Nefertiti acting as a protective goddess, and by the ever-present sun-disks of the Aten.\n\nThe second suite of three chambers (referred to as Alpha, Beta and Gamma) are believed to be used for the burial of Meketaten, Akhenaten's second daughter. Two of the chambers (Alpha and Gamma) are decorated and depict very similar scenes: in the Alpha chamber Akhenaten and Nefertiti bend over the inert body of a woman, weeping and gripping each other's arms for support. Nearby a nurse stands with a baby in her arms, accompanied by a fan-bearer, which indicates the baby's royal status. The names in the scene have been hacked out. In the Gamma chamber a very similar scene is shown; here the hieroglyphs identify the dead young woman as Meketaten. In the same chamber another scene shows Meketaten standing under a canopy which is usually associated with childbirth but can also interpreted as representing the rebirth of the princess. In front of her, amongst courtiers, stand Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their three remaining daughters, Meritaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten Tasherit. The presence of a royal baby causes many to believe the young princess died in childbirth (in this case the father is most likely to have been Akhenaten himself, marrying his daughter), but it cannot be proven.\n\nLarge amounts of the decoration have been destroyed by flooding.\n\nHis body was probably removed after the court returned to Thebes, and reburied somewhere in the Valley of the Kings, possibly in KV55.

Opened from Black Creek Junction to Quakake in 1858 and to Mount Carmel in 1860, it allowed anthracite coal mined along the line and bridge traffic to move east towards New York City. After 1866, it was merged into the Lehigh Valley Railroad to become its Mahanoy Branch.\n\nThe Quakake Railroad was chartered on April 25, 1857 to build a connection between the Beaver Meadow Railroad (later the Lehigh Valley Railroad's Hazleton Branch) at Black Creek Junction, where Quakake Creek empties into Black Creek and the Catawissa, Williamsport and Erie Railroad between its two summit tunnels in Rush Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania (Lofty Tunnel and Ryan's Tunnel). The CW&E's predecessor, the Little Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad, had graded this route as its Quakake or Lehigh Branch and opened most of it for traffic in 1840 (the only part of the LS&S to operate), but abandoned it after a flood devastated the Beaver Meadow Railroad in January 1841. The Quakake Railroad's charter allowed it to occupy that grade with the consent of the CW&E. The construction of the Quakake Railroad was supported by the CW&E, the Beaver Meadow, and the Lehigh Valley Railroads, as its completion allowed coal traffic from the CW&E to travel over the latter two railroads to New York City. The original LS&S grading used an inclined plane to connect the later CW&E main line, on the mountainside between the two tunnels, with the Quakake Branch in the valley below. However, that plan and the inclined plane were abandoned prior to completion of the Quakake Railroad, and instead the junction was moved to the south to Quakake Junction, near Tamanend. The full line opened on August 25, 1858 from Black Creek Junction on the Beaver Meadow Railroad west to Quakake Junction on the CW&E, and was at first operated by that railroad.\n\nA charter supplement issued on March 22, 1859 allowed the Quakake Railroad to extend its line westerly into the headwaters of Mahanoy Creek and down the stream or up its branches \"as far as may be expedient\", and build branches of up to 10 miles to coal mines. Under this authority, the Quakake built an extension in 1860 via Delano to Mount Carmel, where it connected to the Northern Central Railway's Shamokin Valley and Pottsville Railroad. Another charter supplement on March 21, 1860 allowed it to buy its roadbed from the CW&E, which was then being foreclosed and reorganized as the Catawissa Railroad.\n\nThe Quakake Railroad went into foreclosure on September 30, 1862, and was reorganized as the Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroad on October 11. In 1865 a branch was built from Park Place to Mahanoy City. On June 30, 1866 the company was merged into the Lehigh Valley Railroad.\n\nUnder the Lehigh & Mahanoy, the line between Raven Run and Centralia was completed in 1865. In 1866 it was built to Mount Carmel and connected to the Shamokin Valley and Pottsville Railroad owned by the Northern Central Railway. In 1884 the line, which lay low in the valley, was rebuilt higher up on the mountainside by the Lehigh Valley. This avoided flooding from Mine Run. A branch extended from Centralia eastward to the LV's Continental Colliery. It was abandoned when the colliery closed in 1954. A branch was built in 1877 from Kohinoor Junction via Girardville to Ashland. A two-mile switchback was built in 1939 from Logan Junction, west of Centralia to the Germantown Colliery. It as used until 1960 when that operation closed down. Two other extensions were built. In 1890 a one-mile line was constructed from Morris Ridge Junction, east of Mt. Carmel to the Midvalley No. 1 Colliery. In 1892 a three-mile line was built from Montana junction, east of Centralia, to Midvalley Colliery No. 2. These lines were abandoned by 1965 when the fine coal plant at Midvalley closed.\n\nThe decline of coal mining brought about the piecemeal abandonment of these lines. The Ashland Branch was cut back to Girardville in 1951, and in 1953, from Girardville to Weston Colliery. One mile of the Mahanoy City Branch was abandoned in 1957, and the line from Delano to about Gerhards in 1963. The line to Mt. Carmel was cut back to Aristes Junction in 1965, and from there to Raven Run in 1971. The remaining trackage was all abandoned by 1976.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a collection of five vignettes, taking place during the same night, concerning the temporary bond formed between taxi driver and passenger in five cities: Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. Jarmusch wrote the screenplay in about eight days, and the choice of certain cities was largely based on the actors with whom he wanted to work. The soundtrack of the same name is by Tom Waits.\n\nAs evening falls, tomboy cabby Corky (Winona Ryder) picks up Hollywood executive Victoria Snelling (Gena Rowlands) from the airport, and as Corky drives, Victoria tries to conduct business on her phone. Despite their extreme differences socially, the two develop a certain connection. When Victoria suggests that cab driving is not much a career, Corky counters that her dream in fact is to become a mechanic. During the ride Victoria, who is a casting agent, comes to realise that Corky would be ideal for a part in a movie she is casting, but Corky rejects the offer because she intends to be a mechanic.\nThe taxi is a 1985 Chevrolet Caprice Classic Wagon.\n\nHelmut (Armin Mueller-Stahl), an immigrant from East Germany who was a clown in his home country, has found work as a taxi driver. After dark, he picks up a passenger named YoYo (Giancarlo Esposito), a streetwise young man who wants to go to Brooklyn. Increasingly alarmed at Helmut's inability to handle an automatic transmission, ignorance of New York geography and feeble command of the English language, YoYo takes over the wheel. During the drive, YoYo sees his sister-in-law Angela (Rosie Perez) on the street and forces her into the cab to take her back home. Helmut is clearly amused by the vituperation between the two. After Angela and Yoyo depart, Helmut struggles to drive back to Manhattan, muttering \"New York...New York.\"\nThe taxi is a 1983 Ford LTD Crown Victoria.\n\nAt night, a cab picks up two drunk African diplomats, who mock the lowly driver (Isaach De Bankolé) and find it hilarious that he is from the Ivory Coast. In French, when he says he is \"ivoirien\", they say \"il voit rien\" (he can't see a thing). Sick of their insults, he throws them out without making them pay. Next he picks up an attractive young woman (Béatrice Dalle), who is blind. As she cannot see the colour of his skin, he asks her where she thinks he is from. After a moment's thought, she says \"the Ivory Coast\". Prickly and sexually provocative, she rejects most of his efforts to be friendly, regarding him as beneath her, but he is genuinely fascinated by her and her predicament. So much so that, after dropping her off, he watches her walk beside a canal in the dark and drives into another car, whose driver angrily accuses him of being blind.\nThe taxi is a 1980 Peugeot 504.\n\nIn the early morning hours, an eccentric cabbie (Roberto Benigni) picks up a priest (Paolo Bonacelli). As he drives, he starts to confess his sins. Much to the priest's discomfort, he goes into great detail about how he discovered his sexuality, first with a pumpkin and then with a sheep, then details a love affair he had with his brother's wife, miming the actions and mouthing the cries. Already ailing, overwhelmed by the barrage of unwanted information, the priest has a fatal heart attack. Unable to revive him, the cabbie leaves him on a bench to be found once it is light.\nThe taxi is a 1976 Fiat 128.\n\nAfter an evening spent drinking heavily, three workers (Kari Väänänen, Sakari Kuosmanen, and Tomi Salmela), one of whom has just been fired from his job and has passed out, climb into a cab to return home. On the way, the two conscious workers talk about the terrible situation their unconscious friend is in, being out of work and having to face a divorce and a pregnant daughter. The driver, Mika (Matti Pellonpää), then tells them all the saddest story they have ever heard. The workers are terribly moved and depressed by the story, and even become unsympathetic toward their drunken, laid-off companion. Leaving him in the cab, they stagger off to their homes. Mika wakes him, takes payment and leaves. Worker sits on the ground, passing neighbours greet him and he replies back. The taxi is a 1973 Volvo 144.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave the film an approval rating of 75%, based on 24 reviews, and an average rating of 6.3/10.\n\n"}

Galactic discs consist of a stellar component (composed of most of the galaxy's stars) and a gaseous component (mostly composed of cool gas and dust). The stellar population of galactic discs tend to exhibit very little random motion with most of its stars undergoing nearly circular orbits about the galactic center. Discs can be fairly thin because the disc material's motion lies predominantly on the plane of the disc (very little vertical motion). The Milky Way's disc, for example is approximately 1 kpc thick but thickness can vary for discs in other galaxies.\n\nGalactic discs have surface brightness profiles that very closely follow exponential functions in both the radial and vertical directions.\n\nThe surface brightness radial profile of the galactic disc of a typical disc galaxy (viewed face-on) roughly follows an exponential function:\n\nWhere formula_2 is the galaxy's central brightness and formula_3 is the scale length. The scale length is the radius at which the galaxy is a factor of e (~2.7) less bright than it is at its center. Due to the diversity in the shapes and sizes of galaxies, not all galactic discs follow this simple exponential form in their brightness profiles. Some galaxies have been found to have discs with profiles that become truncated in the outermost regions.\n\nWhen viewed edge-on, the vertical surface brightness profiles of galactic discs follow a very similar exponential profile that is proportional to the disc's radial profile:\n\nWhere the scale height formula_5. Although exponential profiles serve as a useful first approximations, vertical surface brightness profiles can also be more complicated. For example, the scale height formula_6, although assumed to be a constant above, can in some cases increase with the radius.\n\nMost of a disc galaxy's gas lies within the disc. Both cool atomic hydrogen (HI) and warm molecular hydrogen (HII) make up most of the disc's gaseous component. This gas serves as the fuel for the formation of new stars in the disc. Although the distribution of gas in the disc is not as well-defined as the stellar component's distribution it is understood (from 21cm emission) that atomic hydrogen is distributed fairly uniformly throughout the disc. 21 cm emission by HI also reveals that the gaseous component can flare out at the outer regions of the galaxy. The abundance of molecular hydrogen makes it a great candidate to help trace the dynamics within the disc. Like the stars within the disc, clumps or clouds of gas follow approximately circular orbits about the galactic center. The circular velocity of the gas in the disc is strongly correlated with the luminosity of the galaxy (see Tully-Fisher Relation). This relationship becomes stronger when the stellar mass is also taken into consideration.\n\nThree stellar components with varying scale heights can be distinguished within the disc of the Milky Way (MW): the \"young thin disc\", the \"old thin disc\", and the \"thick disc\". The \"young thin disc\" is a region in which star formation is taking place and contains the MW's youngest stars and most of its gas and dust. The scale height of this component is roughly 100 pc. The \"old thin disc\" has a scale height of approximately 325 pc while the \"thick disc\" has a scale height of 1.5 kpc. Although stars move primarily within the disc, they exhibit a random enough motion in the direction perpendicular to the disc to result in various scale heights for the different disc components. Stars in the MW's thin disc tend to have higher metallicities compared to the stars in the thick disc. The metal-rich stars in the thin disc have metallicities close to that of the sun (formula_7) and are referred to as population I (pop I) stars while the stars that populate the thick disc are more metal-poor (formula_8) and are referred to as population II (pop II) stars (see stellar population). These distinct ages and metallicities in the different stellar components of the disc points to a strong relationship between the metallicities and ages of stars.\n"}

(film)\n\nGotcha! is a 1985 American action comedy film, starring Anthony Edwards and Linda Fiorentino and directed by Jeff Kanew, who also directed Edwards in \"Revenge of the Nerds\" in 1984.\n\nJonathan Moore (Edwards) is a shy UCLA veterinary student and the reigning champion at \"Gotcha\", a campus-wide paintball game. While on vacation in West Germany, he is seduced by an older woman, the sexy and mysterious Sasha (Fiorentino) who turns out to be an international spy. When he returns home to Los Angeles, there is a strange canister of film in his backpack and a team of KGB agents on his back. Suddenly he is in the middle of a real life-or-death game of \"Gotcha\".\n\nUCLA college student Jonathan Moore (Anthony Edwards) is playing a game called \"Gotcha\" (popular on mid-1980s college campuses as \"Assassin\" or \"Tag\"), wherein the players are all assigned a mock \"hit\" on another player by use of a harmless paintball gun. Moore and his apartment roommate Manolo (Nick Corri) go on a vacation to Paris, France. After touring some of Paris, in a cafe Moore meets Sasha Banicek (Linda Fiorentino), a Czechoslovakian girl. Jonathan has sex with Sasha, losing his virginity.\n\nJonathan decides to leave Manolo (who is heading to Spain) and go with Sasha to West Berlin to spend more time with her. Jonathan believes that he is in love with Sasha. There, Jonathan and Sasha continue to have sex and even go to an Oktoberfest beer gathering. One night, Sasha tells Jonathan that she has to go to East Berlin to pick up a package, as she works as a courier. One night after arriving in East Berlin, Sasha leaves their hotel room and walks to dark street corner. There, Sasha meets a German man who tells her the location of the pickup of her package. Meanwhile, Sasha was being monitored by a Soviet agent, who was sitting in a car at a distance. During the day, Sasha tells Jonathan that if she gives him a certain message, it means that he must immediately leave East Berlin. At a cafe, Sasha gives Jonathan a package and says that a strudel is inside. A little later, Sasha tells Jonathan to meet her at the butcher shop near their hotel. All of a sudden, a Soviet agent begins to chase after her. She is ordered by the German man to use Jonathan to unknowingly get the package over to West Berlin, so the next time they are together she slips an object into his backpack. Later, Sasha is taken by the Soviet agent and East German secret police.\n\nJonathan goes to Checkpoint Charlie (Reggie Thompson) to cross the heavily fortified border into West Berlin. At the East German customs search, Jonathan is stripped of his clothes and his backpack is searched (but the unknown object is not found). Meanwhile, Sasha is stripped and given a cavity search for possible espionage evidence. The Soviet agent arrives at the border crossing to search for Jonathan, who has crossed the border safely before he could be captured. Once in West Berlin, Jonathan feels liberated by the Westernized society. In the hotel, Jonathan receives a message from Sasha to meet him at a specified location. Jonathan finds out that his hotel room was broken into and robbed of his traveler's checks. Soviet agents eventually find Jonathan in West Berlin at the location Sasha gave him, where he meets a woman who asks for the object Sasha gave him, so he gives her the strudel. She tells him that is not the object, but is shot by the Soviets, who chase him throughout a public park. Jumping into a water canal, Jonathan manages to escape from the Soviets and stumbles upon a German rock group headed for Hamburg, who offer him a ride to the airport.\n\nThe rock group successfully get Jonathan to the airport (using full-face makeup to sneak him past a checkpoint) and Jonathan finally arrives in Los Angeles Tom Bradley International Airport and to his apartment. Soon, a band of Soviet agents also arrive in Los Angeles. Once home, Jonathan stumbles upon a film canister in his backpack - the object planted by Sasha. Jonathan visits his parents and tells them what happened in Germany, but they do not believe any of it and think Jonathan is on drugs. Jonathan decides to call the FBI, who refuse to help him and tell him to call the Central Intelligence Agency for help. He does this, telling them about Sasha and the film. Jonathan returns to find his apartment broken into and looted.\n\nThe CIA officer tells Jonathan to give them the photo film canister. At the Los Angeles headquarters of the CIA, Jonathan spots Sasha, who looks like she is working there. Jonathan is able to arrange a meeting with Sasha, and uses Manolo's help to separate her from the CIA agents. Sasha admits that she is Cheryl Brewster, a CIA agent originally from Pittsburgh. Out of nowhere, the Soviet agents begin to chase Jonathan and Sasha on the UCLA campus. Jonathan eliminates all the Soviets with a tranquilizer gun which he gets from the campus veterinary sciences building. The Soviets are arrested, the CIA agents thank Jonathan for his (indirect) help in obtaining the film, and Cheryl/Sasha tells him she wants to continue their relationship.\n\nAfter they part, Jonathan talks to a pretty student who rebuffed him at the start of the movie, and she rebuffs him coldly. As she walks away, he aims the tranquilizer pistol and shoots her in the rear.\n\n\"Gotcha!\" is set in the United States and foreign locations. It was filmed in October 1984, with principal photography around Los Angeles, United States; Paris, France and West Berlin (for East and West Berlin scenes).\n\nThe Original Soundtrack album for \"Gotcha!\" was released in 1985 under the MCA Records label, and features the main theme song \"Gotcha!\" by the British singer Thereza Bazar, her song was specifically recorded for the film; however the single did not chart. The album also included songs by Giuffria and Nik Kershaw, among others.\n\nIn 2020 Intrada Records released a limited edition album of Bill Conti's score, of which two tracks were on the 1985 soundtrack. None of the songs could be licensed for this release. Three songs used in the film were not included on the MCA soundtrack album: \"Two Tribes\" and \"Relax\" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, and \"I Love L.A.\" by Randy Newman.\n\n\"Gotcha!\" received mixed reviews from critics. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" noting the film \"... is a small but elaborately overproduced comedy-melodrama.\" He went on to deride the lack of flair in the film; \"... as devoid of personality as it's possible for a narrative movie to be.\" In a similar vein, Leonard Maltin commented that \"Gotcha!\" was, \"very nearly a good movie, with some sharp dialogue to start but loses its appeal as it loses credibility.\" Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of a possible 4. He described the European sequences as \"a well-directed cat-and-mouse game\" that lost its way in the final act after returning to the US, with the film's main flaw being a focus on Edwards's character when Fiorentino was far more intriguing: \"I'll bet the men who made this movie just assumed it had to be told from his point of view, and never considered hers. Too bad. I think they missed their best chance.\" \"Gotcha!\" currently holds a 36% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews.\n\n\"Gotcha!\" later spawned a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System for use with the Zapper light gun called \"Gotcha! The Sport!\" (1987). A line of toys based on the game and film was also released.\n\nIn the television series Chuck, the name \"Sasha Banicek\" is used for a character played by guest-star Melinda Clarke in the episode \"Chuck vs. The Seduction\" that aired on October 6, 2008.\n\n\n"}

His father, born in Ferrières, Normandy, France accompanied William the Conqueror during his invasion of England. The family was rewarded with a grant of Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire and 114 manors in Derbyshire.\n\nRobert's elder brother William's main interests were in France. He joined Robert Curthose and was captured at Tinchebrai. His other brother Engenulf died shortly after his father and so Robert succeeded to the estates in 1088.\n\nFrom the beginning, he gave great support to Henry I. As part of his tenure of Duffield Frith in 1129–30, he is on record as having interests in lead mines at Wirksworth. At about this time he granted the church of Potterspury, Northamptonshire, to Bernard the Scribe.\n\nIt is, however, during his last years that he is most in evidence as a leading supporter of King Stephen. He took a large body of Derbyshire men northwards to assist in repelling an invasion of the Scots under King David I of Scotland, nominally on the behalf of Matilda. Little actual fighting took place, but Thurstan, Archbishop of York, won the Battle of the Standard on Stephen's behalf, fought near Northallerton, on 22 August 1138.\n\nRobert was mainly instrumental in securing the victory for his Sovereign, who for this and other important services created him Earl of Derby, although charters and chronicles during this period refer to him interchangeably as Earl of Ferrers, Earl of Nottingham or Earl of Derby.\n\nHe died in the following year (1139) and was succeeded in his earldom by his second but eldest surviving son Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Earl of Derby, often known as Robert de Ferrers the Younger. \n\nAs with most Norman lords, the Ferrers brought their Norman underlords to England with them – in this case, the Curzon (of Kedleston), Livet (Levett) and Boscherville (Baskerville) families, who held their fiefs in Normandy from the Ferrers, and who subsequently held their English lands from Ferrers as well. (The undertenant family names derive from Notre-Dame-de-Courson, Livet-en-Ouche and Boscherville, all part of the Ferrers barony in Normandy.) These undertenant retained their ties to the Ferrers after the families had moved to England following the Norman Conquest.\n\n\n"}

He was a multiple-time world champion in two weight divisions, having held the IBF super featherweight title from 1999 to 2000; the WBO super featherweight title in 2004; the WBO lightweight title from 2004 to 2006; and the WBC, \"Ring\" magazine, and lineal lightweight titles from 2005 to 2006.\n\nIn 2005, Corrales received Fight of the Year honors by \"The Ring\" and the Boxing Writers Association of America for his acclaimed first bout with José Luis Castillo.\n\nCorrales was born in Columbia, South Carolina to a Colombian father, Diego Corrales Sr. and a Mexican mother. Corrales' early life was filled with violence; he was raised in the Oak Park section of Sacramento, was involved with street gangs at age 13, and witnessed his best friend's death via drive-by shooting. Corrales had a degree in culinary arts. He trained at \"Sac Pal\" (Sacramento Police Athletic League) Boxing Gym.\n\nCorrales compiled an amateur boxing record of 105-12. In 1994, he took second place at the United States Amateur Championships, losing to Frankie Carmona on points in the featherweight final.\nHe reached the first round of the featherweight bracket at the 1995 Pan American Games, losing to Arnaldo Mesa. At the 1995 World Championships, he lost out on a medal after losing to Marco Rudolph in the lightweight bracket.\n\nOn January 20, 2001, Corrales challenged \"Ring\" No. 2 ranked Super Featherweight and #7 Pound-For-Pound Floyd Mayweather Jr. for the WBC super featherweight title and recorded his first knockdown and first loss. In the bout, Mayweather knocked down Corrales five times (three times in the seventh round and twice in the tenth). After the fifth knockdown, Corrales' corner stopped the fight, despite Corrales' protests.\n\nShortly after the Mayweather fight, Corrales served 14 months in prison after opting for a plea bargain on charges he faced for abusing his pregnant wife, Maria.\n\nIn 2003, Corrales returned to the ring. After easily winning four fights, Corrales fought against \"Ring\" No. 1 ranked Super Featherweight Joel Casamayor. After the sixth round, the fight was stopped because of a deep cut inside of Corrales' mouth. On March 6, 2004, there was a rematch for the vacant WBO super featherweight title. Corrales won by close split decision.\n\nOn August 7, 2004, Corrales fought former two-time Super Featherweight champion and current WBO Lightweight champion, Acelino Freitas, who came into the bout unbeaten. Corrales won the fight, via TKO in the tenth round, making Corrales a two weight champion. Freitas won the early rounds, but by the later rounds he was visibly tired and began to be caught by Corrales. After rising from his third knockdown, Freitas walked away from the referee and quit.\n\nOn May 7, 2005, Corrales defeated WBC and \"Ring\" Lightweight champion José Luis Castillo via TKO in the tenth round, giving Corrales his fourth title in 2 weight classes. The fight is almost universally regarded as the best fight of 2005. Both men stood in front of each other, battering each other with hard combinations and power punches throughout the entire fight. Finally, in the tenth round, Castillo knocked Corrales down. Seconds later, Castillo knocked Corrales down again. Corrales managed to beat the count, and, after a point was taken away for excessive spitting out of the mouthpiece, Corrales connected with a punch that Castillo later called \"a perfect right hand.\" Corrales then trapped Castillo against the ropes and landed numerous punches, causing the referee, Tony Weeks, to stop the fight.\n\nA rematch between Corrales and Castillo occurred on October 8, 2005. On the day before the fight, Castillo weighed-in 3½ lb over the lightweight limit. Since Castillo did not make the weight, the fight became a non-title bout. The two fighters continued with the same fighting style that they had used in the first fight, trading inside punches throughout the first three rounds. Early in the fourth round, Castillo knocked down Corrales with a left hook to his chin. Corrales wobbled to his feet at the referee's count of ten, causing the fight to end.\n\nCorrales vs. Castillo III, dubbed \"The War to Settle the Score,\" had been scheduled for February 4, 2006, but it was postponed because of a rib injury that Corrales suffered while training. The fight was rescheduled for June 3, 2006. At the weigh-in, however, Corrales weighed the lightweight limit whereas Castillo weighed 139½ lb—causing the fight to be cancelled. Corrales later sued Castillo for punitive damages.\n\nCorrales was scheduled to defend his lightweight title in a third bout against Joel Casamayor on October 7, 2006. However, Corrales weighed in 5 pounds over the limit. He was given two hours to shed five pounds, but came back at 139 pounds. Corrales would have been stripped of the title if he had won the bout, but Casamayor defeated him by split decision for the WBC and \"The Ring\" lightweight titles.\n\nOn April 7, 2007, fighting in the welterweight division, Corrales lost a unanimous decision to Joshua Clottey. Corrales was dropped in rounds 9 and 10 and lost by the scores of 97-90, 98-89\nand 100-87.\n\nCorrales served 14 months in the Deuel Vocational Institution, a correctional facility in San Joaquin County, California, after being convicted of domestic battery on his then pregnant partner.\n\nOn May 7, 2007, exactly two years to the day after his first fight with Castillo, Corrales was killed in a three-vehicle accident near his Las Vegas home. Corrales was riding a 2007 Suzuki GSXR 1000 motorcycle, traveling northbound on Fort Apache Road in the southwest part of the Las Vegas Valley, Corrales attempted to pass another vehicle at high speed, but Corrales struck the back of the car and was thrown more than 100 feet into oncoming traffic and struck by another vehicle. An ambulance was called by the witnesses at the scene, Corrales was rushed to a hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. Las Vegas police spokesman Sgt. Tracy McDonald said: \"The accident occurred at approximately 7:30 p.m. PDT.\" McDonald could not say how fast the motorcycle was traveling. Corrales' blood alcohol content was 0.25 at the time of the crash, approximately 3 times the legal limit for Nevada.\n\n\nFamily:"}
{"id": "2269422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269422", "title": "Supreme Court of Texas", "text": "Supreme Court of Texas\n\nThe Supreme Court of Texas (SCOTX) is the court of last resort for civil appeals (including juvenile delinquency cases, which are categorized as civil under the Texas Family Code) in the U.S. state of Texas. A different court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA), is the court of last resort in criminal cases. \n\nThe Court has its seat at the Supreme Court Building on the State Capitol grounds in Austin, Texas. \n\nLike the U.S. Supreme Court, the Texas Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and eight associate justices. Unlike the SCOTUS, however, all nine positions are elected, with a term of office of six years with no term limit, rather than life tenure. All members typically belong to the same party because all are elected in statewide races, rather than by the electorates of smaller appellate districts, as the justices on the intermediate appellate courts are. Although there are fourteen such courts, the state is geographically divided into thirteen. Two districts (the 1st and the 14th) are coextensive. The First and Fourteenth Courts of Appeals serve the same ten counties, sit in the same Downtown Houston Courthouse, and also share a single clerk. \n\nThe Texas Supreme Court was established in 1846 to replace the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas. It meets in Downtown Austin, Texas in an office building near the Texas State Capitol.\n\nBy statute, the Texas Supreme Court has administrative control over the State Bar of Texas, an agency of the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court has the sole authority to license attorneys in Texas, and also appoints the members of the Board of Law Examiners which, under instructions of the Supreme Court, administers the Texas bar exam. The Court has the last word in attorney disciplinary proceedings brought by the Commission for Lawyer Discipline, a committee of the State Bar of Texas, but rarely exercises discretionary review in such cases. The Supreme Court accepts fewer than 100 cases per year to be decided on the merits. In addition to its adjudicatory and administrative functions, the Supreme Court promulgates, and occasionally revises, court rules of procedure, which include the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (TRCP), the Texas Rules of Evidence (TRE), and the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure (TRAP). \n\nThe Texas Supreme Court is the only state supreme court in the United States in which the manner in which it denies discretionary review can actually imply approval or disapproval of the merits of the lower court's decision and in turn may affect the geographic extent of the precedential effect of that decision. In March 1927, the Texas Legislature enacted a law directing the Texas Supreme Court to summarily \"refuse\" to hear applications for writs of error when it believed the Court of Appeals opinion correctly stated the law. Thus, since June 1927, over 4,100 decisions of the Texas Courts of Appeals have become valid binding precedent of the Texas Supreme Court itself because the high court refused applications for writ of error rather than denying them and thereby signaled that it approved of their holdings as the law of the state.\n\nWhile Texas's unique practice saved the state supreme court from having to hear relatively minor cases just to create uniform statewide precedents on those issues, it also makes for lengthy citations to the opinions of the Courts of Appeals, since the subsequent writ history of the case must always be noted (e.g., no writ, writ refused, writ denied, etc.) in order for the reader to determine at a glance whether the cited opinion is binding precedent only in the district of the Court of Appeals in which it was decided, or binding precedent for the entire state. Citations to cases from the Houston-based Courts of Appeals are also longer than others because they require identification of the appellate district number -- [1st Dist.] or [14th Dist.] -- in addition to the name of the city. \n\nThe Texas Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and eight associate justices, each of whom has one vote. Each member of the Court must be at least 35 years of age, a citizen of Texas, licensed to practice law in Texas, and must have practiced law (or have been a lawyer and a judge of a court of record together) for at least ten years. The Clerk of the Court, currently Blake A. Hawthorne, is appointed by the Justices and serves a four-year term, which is renewable. \n\nAll members of the court are elected to six-year terms in statewide partisan elections. Because their terms are staggered, only a subset of justices is up for re-election in any one election cycle. When a vacancy arises, the Governor of Texas appoints a replacement, subject to Senate confirmation, to serve out the unexpired term until December 31 after the next general election. The initial term of tenure is therefore often less than six years. Most of the current justices were originally appointed either by former Governor Rick Perry or by the current Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, who is himself a former member of the SCOTX. \n\nLike the judges on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, all members of the Texas Supreme Court are Republicans.\n\nThe most recent appointees are Jane Bland, Jimmy Blacklock, and Brett Busby. \n\nBrett Busby and Jane Bland are former Court of Appeals justices from Houston, whose re-election bids failed in November 2018 when Democrats won all of the judicial races. Blacklock formerly served Governor Greg Abbott as general counsel. \n\nBlacklock replaced Don Willett, who now sits on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal appellate court that hears appeals from federal district courts in Texas. Busby succeeds Phil Johnson, who retired in 2018, and was sworn in on  March 20, 2019. Jane Bland was appointed in September 2019 to fill the vacancy left by Jeff Brown, who resigned from the SCOTX to accept appointment to a U.S. district court bench. \n\nThe position of Chief Justice is designated Place 1 and is currently held by Nathan Hecht, the longest-serving member of the Court. It was previously held by Wallace B. Jefferson, who is now a frequent advocate before the high court on behalf of private clients, as are several other former members of the Court. \n\nThe other eight position numbers have no special significance except for identification purposes on the ballot. Informally, justices are ranked by seniority, and their profiles appear on the Court's website in that order. \n\nEach member of the Texas Supreme Court is elected in a statewide contest, which is a key reason why there is no representation of the minority party on the Court, even though Democrats are now well-represented at the lower levels of the judicial hierarchy, whose judges are elected from smaller appellate districts and from counties. \n\nSingle-party control of the Court has a distorting impact on the High Court's jurisprudence, which was true when Democrats were dominant, as is true now after decades of the Republican lock on the high court. There are no liberal and conservative wings on the Court, and no swing votes. Most decisions are unanimous. Republican Governor Greg Abbott does his best to assure preservation of partisan Republican control of the judiciary. His appointees to vacancies are screened for ideological acceptability with a questionnaire that asks the candidate what U.S. Supreme Court decision they disagree with. \n\nHortense Sparks Ward, who became the first woman to pass the Texas Bar Exam in 1910, was appointed Special Chief Justice of an all-female Texas Supreme Court 15 years later. All of the court's male justices recused themselves from \"Johnson\" v. \"Darr\", a 1924 case involving the Woodmen of the World, and, since nearly every member of the Texas Bar was a member of that fraternal organization, paying personal insurance premiums that varied with the claims decided against it, no male judges or attorneys could be found to hear the case. After ten months of searching for suitable male replacements to decide the case, Governor Pat Neff decided on January 1, 1925, to appoint a special court composed of three women. This court, consisting of Ward, Hattie Leah Henenberg, and Ruth Virginia Brazzil, met for five months and ultimately ruled in favor of Woodmen of the World.\n\nOn July 25, 1982, Ruby Kless Sondock became the court's first regular female justice, when she was appointed to replace the Associate Justice James G. Denton who had died of a heart attack. Sondock served the remainder of Denton's term, which ended on December 31, 1982, but did not seek election to the Supreme Court in her own right. Rose Spector became the first woman elected to the court in 1992 and served until 1998 when she was defeated by Harriet O'Neill.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court currently has three women members, one of them Hispanic. Two of the female members of the Supreme Court were previously family court judges (Lehrmann and Guzman); the third (Bland) served as a district judge in the civil trial division of the Harris County district courts before being appointed to the intermediate court of appeals. As of September 2019, women jurists fill almost half of the 80 intermediate appellate positions. Some of the fourteen intermediate courts of appeals have female majorities. \n\nJudicial Committee on Information Technology (JCIT)\n\nCreated in 1997 JCIT was established to set standards and guidelines for the systematic implementation and integration of information technology into the trial and appellate courts in Texas.\n\nJCIT approaches this mission by providing a forum for state-local, inter-branch, and public-private collaboration, and development of policy recommendations for the Supreme Court of Texas. Court technology, and the information it carries, are sprawling topics, and Texas is a diverse state with decentralized funding and decision-making for trial court technology. JCIT provides a forum for discussion of court technology and information projects. With this forum, JCIT reaches out to external partners such as the Conference of Urban Counties, the County Information Resource Agency, Texas.gov, and TIJIS (Texas Integrated Justice Information Systems), and advises or is consulted by the Office of Court Administration on a variety of projects.\n\nThree themes consistently recur in the JCIT conversation: expansion and governance of electronic filing; the evolution and proliferation of court case management systems; and the evolution and governance of technology standards for reporting and sharing information across systems in civil, family, juvenile, and criminal justice.\n\nThe Founding Chair of JCIT from 1997–2009 was Peter S. Vogel, a partner at Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP in Dallas, and since 2009 the JCIT Chair has been Justice Rebecca Simmons.\n\nWhile Republican incumbents suffered massive defeats in the Courts of Appeals on November 6, 2018, bringing about a switch of majorities from Republicans to Democrats in Dallas, Houston, and Austin, the three Republican incumbents on the Texas Supreme Court who faced the entire Texas electorate in statewide races won comfortably.\n\nIncumbent John Devine prevailed over his opponent R.K. Sandill, a sitting district court judge of Asian-American descent in Houston, with 53.75% of the vote and secured a second term. Justice Jeff Brown beat off a challenge by Democratic candidate Kathy Cheng (who unlike her fellow Democratic challengers did not have comparable judicial experience) with the same vote margin. The high court’s most recent appointed member, Jimmy Blacklock, defeated Steven Kirkland, who like Sandill serves as a district court judge in Houston, with 53.17% of the vote. Neither Sandill nor Kirkland were up for reelection this year and are expected to remain on their respective district court benches.\n\nJustice Blacklock faced the electorate for the first time, having recently been appointed. Blacklock was Governor Abbott’s replacement for Justice Don Willett, who ascended to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals before his term on the Texas Supreme Court had expired, thus creating a vacancy and an opportunity for the Governor to fill it with an already-vetted candidate of his own.\n\nAll appellate court races were clearly driven by party-line voting. That worked in favor of Republican incumbents at the statewide level as usual, but against Republican incumbents in the court of appeals, whose members are each elected from one of fourteen appellate districts. Some of those districts favored Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, which entailed heavy Republican losses at the trial court level likewise.\n\nUnder the leadership of Governor Greg Abbott Texas Republicans have since moved to change the way Texas selects judges and justices in the major metropolitan jurisdictions. Their legislative initiative to amend the Texas constitution to forestall Democratic gains in third branch of government was unsuccessful, but a commission was formed to look at alternative selection methods. \n\nThe six-year terms of office of the members of the Texas Supreme Court are staggered. Three Republican incumbents -- Green, Guzman, and Lehrmann were up for reelection in 2016 and won easily, as was expected, given the statewide nature of their electoral constituency in a Red state. Debra Lehrmann had been challenged by Michael Massengale, then a justice on the First Court of Appeals in Houston, in the Republican primary for not being conservative enough with respect to med-mal suits. Massengale later lost his re-election bid for the First Court of Appeals position to a Democrat, Richard Hightower, in the Democratic sweep of the intermediate courts of appeals in November 2018. \n\nTexas is one of seven states that elects Supreme Court justices on partisan ballots. Four justices of the Texas Supreme Court faced re-election in 2014. Three of the four sitting Supreme Court Justices, Chief Justice Nathan Hecht, Justice Jeff Brown and Justice Phil Johnson, were required to defeat challengers in a March primary before the general election in November. The candidates challenging the incumbent Supreme Court Justices, according to reports filed with the Texas Ethics Commission, were recruited for the election and funded by a Houston plaintiff lawyer and Ali Davari, owner of two strip clubs: Sexy City and Erotic Zone.\n\n\"Texas for Lawsuit Reform\" commented on the Texas election by saying, \"Plaintiff trial lawyers are making an unprecedented attempt to regain the control of the Supreme Court that they enjoyed in the 1970s and 1980s, when Texas was known as 'The Lawsuit Capitol of the World.'\" Also, an airing of Sixty Minutes entitled \"Justice for Sale\" gave a devastating critique of the Texas Supreme Court. \nHouston plaintiff lawyer Mark Lanier, funded the bulk of the campaign to remove the Texas Supreme Court and business groups. Funding was disclosed in an article titled \"Plaintiff Trial Lawyers Attempt to Distort Role of Judges and Juries\".\n\nIn the years preceding the Texas Judicial Election, Lanier had become a vocal critic of the Texas Supreme Court after the Supreme Court reversed his signature trial verdict against Merck & Co. on behalf of a widow whose husband died after taking Vioxx. After Lanier suffered a second high-profile loss of a Vioxx case, in which the Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Houston concluded in MERCK & CO., INC. v. Ernst, a wrongful death case by a widow, that Lanier failed to show that the ingestion of Vioxx caused the death of his client's spouse. Lanier's publicly criticized the Texas Supreme Court stating that it employs \"a simpleton approach that basically white washes the trial, ignores the evidence, and is very conclusion based\".\n\nLanier responded to the appellate setbacks in a press release:\nAll judicial challengers recruited and funded by the Texas plaintiff lawyers lost to the incumbent Texas Supreme Court justices who won the 2014 Texas election.\n\nIn May 2016, in a 100-page ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that public school financing, a long-term political issue in Texas, is imperfect but constitutional. Specifically, the court ruled that the funding \"satisfies minimum constitutional requirements\". More than half of the school districts across the state had wanted the court to force the Texas State Legislature to guarantee equal tax revenues to wealthy and poorer districts alike. The court, which has only one Democrat member among the nine justices, said that legislators must tackle school funding and not expect the court to make specific policy decisions.\n\n\nTexas Supreme Court History: Links to Resources\n"}

{"id": "2269436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269436", "title": "Anthony of Kiev", "text": "Anthony of Kiev\n\nAnthony of Kyiv, also called Anthony of the Caves (, ; c. 983-1073) was a monk and the founder of the monastic tradition in Kyivan Rus'. Together with Theodosius of Kyiv, he co-founded the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (Kyiv Monastery of the Caves).\n\nHe was born in Lyubech in Chernigov Principality and was baptized with the name \"Antipas\". He was drawn to the spiritual life from an early age and left for the Greek Orthodox Esphigmenou Monastery on Mount Athos to live as a hermit. He lived in a secluded cave there overlooking the sea, which is still shown to visitors. In circa 1011, the abbot gave Anthony the job of expanding monasticism in his native Kiev, which had only recently begun its conversion to Christianity.\n\nAnthony returned to Kyiv, and founded several monasteries on the Greek model on the order of local princes. These monasteries were not as austere as Anthony was used to from his time on Mount Athos. He instead chose to live in a small four-yard cave which had been dug by the presbyter Hilarion.\n\nIn 1015, his peaceful austerity was interrupted by the death of Vladimir I of Kyiv, and the subsequent fratricidal war for the throne between Vladimir's sons Yaroslav and Sviatopolk, and Anthony returned to Mount Athos. When the conflict ended, the abbot sent Anthony back to Kyiv, prophesying that many monks would join him on his return.\n\nOn his return, Anthony found a small 4-yard cave which Hilarion had dug before his elevation as the first native Metropolitan of Kyiv. Anthony became well known in the area for his strict asceticism. He ate rye bread every other day and drank only a little water. His fame soon spread beyond Kyiv, and several people began to ask for his spiritual guidance or blessing. Soon, some people even offered to join him. Eventually, Anthony accepted the company of a few of them. The first was a priest named Nikon. The second was Theodosius of Kyiv.\n\nThe new monastery enjoyed royal favor almost from the beginning, although there were occasional problems. When Iziaslav I of Kyiv demanded that the son of a wealthy boyar and one of his own retainers be told to leave the monastery, Nikon said he could not take soldiers away from the King of Heaven. This did nothing to placate Iziaslav's anger, and Anthony decided that it might be expedient for him to leave. Anthony returned after Iziaslav's wife requested his return.\n\nShortly thereafter Anthony had gained twelve disciples. Anthony, devoted to the model of the solitary hermit set by his namesake Anthony the Great, left his cave for a nearby mountain so he could continue to live the solitary life. There he dug another cave for himself and lived in seclusion there. This cave became the first of what would later be known as the Far Caves.\n\nIn time, the first official abbot of the monastery, Barlaam of Kyiv, was called by Iziaslav to head a new monastery, St. Demetrios, which had been built at the gates of the city. The monks requested Anthony to name the replacement, and he named Theodosius.\n\nAs the number of monks grew and crowding became a problem, Anthony requested that Iziaslav give them the hill in which the caves were located. He did so, and the monks built a wooden church and some cells there, encircling the area with a wooden fence. Theodosius continued to consult Anthony in the guidance of the community and, as the monastery grew, so did Anthony's reputation.\n\nWhen Iziaslav and his brothers were facing a popular uprising involving the Cumans, they came to Anthony for his blessing. They did not get it. Anthony foretold that because of their sins they would be defeated, and that the brothers would be buried in a church they would build. Shortly thereafter Iziaslav left because of the rebellion. He suspected Anthony of sympathizing with the opposition and arranged to banish Anthony upon his return. Before he could do so, Iziaslav's brother, Sviatoslav, arranged for Anthony to be secretly taken to Chernigov. Anthony dug himself a cave there. The Eletsky Monastery there is said by some to be built on the site of Anthony's cave. Eventually Iziaslav was again reconciled to Anthony and asked that he return to Kiev.\n\nOn his return, Anthony and Theodosius decided to build a larger stone church to accommodate the ever-increasing number of monks. Anthony himself did not live to see the church completed. He died in 1073, shortly after blessing the foundation of the new church, at 90 years old. Shortly before his death he called the monks together and consoled them about his coming death. He also asked them that his remains be hidden away forever. The monks carried out his request. He was reportedly buried in his cave, but no relics have ever been found. Many however have subsequently come to the cave to pray and many of them have reported being healed there.\n\nSt. Anthony is venerated as a saint and the founder of monasticism in Ruthenia. His feast day falls on July 10. Since the Ukrainian Orthodox Church follows the Julian Calendar, the day on which his feast is celebrated is currently July 23 on the modern Gregorian Calendar. Saint Anthony is also venerated by Greek Catholics and is listed in the \"Martyrologium Romanum\" of the Roman Catholic Church with a feast day of May 7.\n\nHis relics have never been found.\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded by Brother John of Mary, F.S.C., and two other Christian Brothers in St. Matthew's parish, at 15th and G Streets.\n\nSt. John's College was established for young men by Brother John of Mary, F.S.C., and two other Christian Brothers in St. Matthew's parish, 15th and G Streets NW. The three men had been members of the faculty of Calvert Hall College, Baltimore, since its founding in 1845. Because of space limitations, in 1866 the Brothers moved the school to Carroll Hall at 10th and G Streets NW at the invitation of Father Walter. In 1868, the Brothers returned to St. Matthew's parish at the request of Father Charles White, who had built a new school named St. Matthew's Institute at the corner of 16th and L Streets NW.\n\nIn 1878, the Brothers purchased the property at 1225 Vermont Avenue NW from the estate of General Montgomery C. Meigs as the site for a new school building. In August of that year, the construction of the building was begun. At first it was known as St. John's Collegiate Institute, and finally, in 1887, it assumed the title of St. John's College. That same year, the college was incorporated under the District of Columbia statutes with the power to confer the academic degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts. At the commencement of June 26, 1888 two Bachelor of Arts, four Bachelor of Science, and three Master of Arts degrees were conferred on graduates.\n\nAs the undergraduate departments of The Catholic University of America and Georgetown University expanded, it was decided in 1921 by the Board of Trustees of St. John's to discontinue the college department and devote the school facilities to secondary education alone. In the meantime, St. John's did pioneer work in commercial education by opening a school of commerce and finance at 13th and Massachusetts Avenue NW. Three years after the college department was discontinued, the annex building, housing the gym, swimming pool, and freshman classes, was built.\n\nSt. John's grew for the next thirty years, until it became apparent that the Vermont Avenue facilities were no longer adequate. With further expansion in mind, the Brothers purchased the present campus bounded by Rock Creek Park. This property, together with the mansion located there, provided sufficient space for the freshman classes and athletic events. As the Vermont Avenue buildings became less useful, the Brothers decided to build a new school on the Military Road Campus. The new St. John's opened to more than one thousand students in September 1959. In 1991 the school became a co-educational military optional institution.\n\nIn 1977 a man wearing a blue parka with a fur-lined hood and a surgical mask entered the cafeteria and joined the lunch line, then attempted to rob the cashier. The school business director, William McGregor, confronted the suspect and consequently was shot in the face, right leg and arm and below his right ear in the confrontation according to the police. The suspect exited the building and shot a student in the shoulder during his escape.\n\nSt. John's teams play in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference.\n\nBoys' sports\n\nGirls' sports\n\nCoed sports\n\nThe 2008 St. John's vs. Gonzaga College High School football game was recognized as one of the top 25 rivalries in the nation by inclusion in the Great American Rivalry Series. In 2013 the varsity football team defeated their historical rival Gonzaga in the WCAC semi-finals, advancing to the championship game for the first time in over 20 years, which they lost to the Dematha Stags.\n\nOn November 18, 2017, St. John’s varsity football team defeated Gonzaga 30-7 to win the 2017 WCAC championship. They finished the season having gone undefeated in the WCAC for the first time since 1976 and having won the school’s first football conference championship since 1989. The 2017 team is also the only St. John's football team to ever defeat both DeMatha (first win since 1994) and Gonzaga twice in the same season. In 2017 the St. John's varsity football team finished their season ranked 17th and 19th in the country, after starting the pre-season ranked No. 21.\n\nIn 2007, the St. John's girls' soccer team was ranked #1 in the nation in early September. After finishing with two losses for the season, they were ranked #5. In 2011 they were ranked #15 in the nation at the end of the season.\n\nSt. John's varsity baseball team won the 2018 WCAC baseball championship, the fifth consecutive title for the school, and the sixth title since 2010.\n\nThe campus features three multi-sport turf surfaces used for field hockey, football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer and softball. Baseball plays at Gibbs Field. Gallagher Gymnasium is the home of the basketball, volleyball and wrestling teams. The school also has four tennis courts used by the tennis program.\n\nA military cadet company was established at the school in 1915 after an inspection by the War Department, which detailed Major John Augustus Dapray, retired, to the school on December 30, 1915 as the first professor of military science and tactics. The school later established a Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program, and was one of 100 original U.S. Army JROTC programs established by the U.S. Congress under the National Defense Act of 1916.\n\nIn addition to regular classroom instruction, cadets participate in regional and national competitions as members of Raiders (called the Rangers until 1994), the drill team (called the \"McGovern Rifles\"; see notable alumni below), rifle team (marksmanship club), and color guard. The regiment participates in many events each year, such as the annual Cherry Blossom Parade and Presidential inaugurations (including the 2005 Inauguration of George W. Bush). Originally mandatory, the program became optional in 1991. By 2005, 50 percent of the students participated in the JROTC program, and current participation is less than one-fifth of the student body.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2269463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269463", "title": "Thermonuclear weapon", "text": "Thermonuclear weapon\n\nA thermonuclear weapon, fusion weapon or hydrogen bomb (H bomb), is a second-generation nuclear weapon design. Its greater sophistication affords it vastly greater destructive power than first-generation atomic bombs, a more compact size, a lower mass or a combination of these benefits. Characteristics of nuclear fusion reactions make possible the use of non-fissile depleted uranium as the weapon's main fuel, thus allowing more efficient use of scarce fissile material such as uranium-235 (U-235) or plutonium-239 (Pu-239).\n\nModern fusion weapons consist essentially of two main components: a nuclear fission primary stage (fueled by U-235 or Pu-239) and a separate nuclear fusion secondary stage containing thermonuclear fuel: the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, or in modern weapons lithium deuteride. For this reason, thermonuclear weapons are often colloquially called hydrogen bombs or H-bombs.\n\nA fusion explosion begins with the detonation of the fission primary stage. Its temperature soars past approximately one hundred million kelvins, causing it to glow intensely with thermal X-radiation. These X-rays flood the void (the \"radiation channel\" often filled with polystyrene foam) between the primary and secondary assemblies placed within an enclosure called a radiation case, which confines the X-ray energy and resists its outward pressure. The distance separating the two assemblies ensures that debris fragments from the fission primary (which move much slower than X-ray photons) cannot disassemble the secondary before the fusion explosion runs to completion.\n\nThe secondary fusion stage—consisting of outer pusher/tamper, fusion fuel filler and central plutonium spark plug—is imploded by the X-ray energy impinging on its pusher/tamper. This compresses the entire secondary stage and drives up the density of the plutonium spark plug. The density of the plutonium fuel rises to such an extent that the spark plug is driven into a supercritical state, and it begins a nuclear fission chain reaction. The fission products of this chain reaction heat the highly compressed, and thus superdense, thermonuclear fuel surrounding the spark plug to around 300 million kelvins, igniting fusion reactions between fusion fuel nuclei. In modern weapons fueled by lithium deuteride, the fissioning plutonium spark plug also emits free neutrons which collide with lithium nuclei and supply the tritium component of the thermonuclear fuel.\n\nThe secondary's relatively massive tamper (which resists outward expansion as the explosion proceeds) also serves as a thermal barrier to keep the fusion fuel filler from becoming too hot, which would spoil the compression. If made of uranium, enriched uranium or plutonium, the tamper captures fast fusion neutrons and undergoes fission itself, increasing the overall explosive yield. Additionally, in most designs the radiation case is also constructed of a fissile material that undergoes fission driven by fast thermonuclear neutrons. Such bombs are classified as three stage weapons, and most current Teller–Ulam designs are such fission-fusion-fission weapons. Fast fission of the tamper and radiation case is the main contribution to the total yield and is the dominant process that produces radioactive fission product fallout.\n\nThe first full-scale thermonuclear test was carried out by the United States in 1952; the concept has since been employed by most of the world's nuclear powers in the design of their weapons. The design of all modern thermonuclear weapons in the United States is known as the \"Teller–Ulam configuration\" for its two chief contributors, Edward Teller and Stanislaw Ulam, who developed it in 1951 for the United States, with certain concepts developed with the contribution of physicist John von Neumann. Similar devices were developed by the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, and China. \n\nAs thermonuclear weapons represent the most efficient design for weapon energy yield in weapons with yields above , virtually all the nuclear weapons of this size deployed by the five nuclear-weapon states under the Non-Proliferation Treaty today are thermonuclear weapons using the Teller–Ulam design.\n\nDetailed knowledge of fission and fusion weapons is classified to some degree in virtually every industrialized nation. In the United States, such knowledge can by default be classified as \"Restricted Data\", even if it is created by persons who are not government employees or associated with weapons programs, in a legal doctrine known as \"born secret\" (though the constitutional standing of the doctrine has been at times called into question; see \"United States v. Progressive, Inc.\"). Born secret is rarely invoked for cases of private speculation. The official policy of the United States Department of Energy has been not to acknowledge the leaking of design information, as such acknowledgment would potentially validate the information as accurate. In a small number of prior cases, the U.S. government has attempted to censor weapons information in the public press, with limited success. According to the \"New York Times\", physicist Kenneth W. Ford defied government orders to remove classified information from his book, \"Building the H Bomb: A Personal History\". Ford claims he used only pre-existing information and even submitted a manuscript to the government, which wanted to remove entire sections of the book for concern that foreign nations could use the information.\n\nThough large quantities of vague data have been officially released, and larger quantities of vague data have been unofficially leaked by former bomb designers, most public descriptions of nuclear weapon design details rely to some degree on speculation, reverse engineering from known information, or comparison with similar fields of physics (inertial confinement fusion is the primary example). Such processes have resulted in a body of unclassified knowledge about nuclear bombs that is generally consistent with official unclassified information releases, related physics, and is thought to be internally consistent, though there are some points of interpretation that are still considered open. The state of public knowledge about the Teller–Ulam design has been mostly shaped from a few specific incidents outlined in a section below.\n\nThe basic principle of the Teller–Ulam configuration is the idea that different parts of a thermonuclear weapon can be chained together in \"stages\", with the detonation of each stage providing the energy to ignite the next stage. At a bare minimum, this implies a \"primary\" section that consists of an implosion-type fission bomb (a \"trigger\"), and a \"secondary\" section that consists of fusion fuel. The energy released by the \"primary\" compresses the \"secondary\" through a process called \"radiation implosion\", at which point it is heated and undergoes nuclear fusion. This process could be continued, with energy from the secondary igniting a third fusion stage; Russia's AN602 \"Tsar Bomba\" is thought to have been a three-stage fission-fusion-fusion device. Theoretically by continuing this process thermonuclear weapons with arbitrarily high yield could be constructed. This contrasts with fission weapons which are limited in yield because only so much fission fuel can be amassed in one place before the danger of its accidentally becoming supercritical becomes too great.\n\nSurrounding the other components is a hohlraum or \"radiation case\", a container that traps the first stage or primary's energy inside temporarily. The outside of this radiation case, which is also normally the outside casing of the bomb, is the only direct visual evidence publicly available of any thermonuclear bomb component's configuration. Numerous photographs of various thermonuclear bomb exteriors have been declassified.\n\nThe primary is thought to be a standard implosion method fission bomb, though likely with a core boosted by small amounts of fusion fuel (usually 50/50% deuterium/tritium gas) for extra efficiency; the fusion fuel releases excess neutrons when heated and compressed, inducing additional fission. When fired, the Pu-239 or U-235 core would be compressed to a smaller sphere by special layers of conventional high explosives arranged around it in an explosive lens pattern, initiating the nuclear chain reaction that powers the conventional \"atomic bomb\".\n\nThe secondary is usually shown as a column of fusion fuel and other components wrapped in many layers. Around the column is first a \"pusher-tamper\", a heavy layer of uranium-238 (U-238) or lead that helps compress the fusion fuel (and, in the case of uranium, may eventually undergo fission itself). Inside this is the fusion fuel itself, usually a form of lithium deuteride, which is used because it is easier to weaponize than liquefied tritium/deuterium gas. This dry fuel, when bombarded by neutrons, produces tritium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen which can undergo nuclear fusion, along with the deuterium present in the mixture. (See the article on nuclear fusion for a more detailed technical discussion of fusion reactions.) Inside the layer of fuel is the \"spark plug\", a hollow column of fissile material (Pu-239 or U-235) often boosted by deuterium gas. The spark plug, when compressed, can itself undergo nuclear fission (because of the shape, it is not a critical mass without compression). The tertiary, if one is present, would be set below the secondary and probably be made up of the same materials.\n\nSeparating the secondary from the primary is the interstage. The fissioning primary produces four types of energy: 1) expanding hot gases from high explosive charges that implode the primary; 2) superheated plasma that was originally the bomb's fissile material and its tamper; 3) the electromagnetic radiation; and 4) the neutrons from the primary's nuclear detonation. The interstage is responsible for accurately modulating the transfer of energy from the primary to the secondary. It must direct the hot gases, plasma, electromagnetic radiation and neutrons toward the right place at the right time. Less than optimal interstage designs have resulted in the secondary failing to work entirely on multiple shots, known as a \"fissile fizzle\". The Castle Koon shot of Operation Castle is a good example; a small flaw allowed the neutron flux from the primary to prematurely begin heating the secondary, weakening the compression enough to prevent any fusion.\n\nThere is very little detailed information in the open literature about the mechanism of the interstage. One of the best sources is a simplified diagram of a British thermonuclear weapon similar to the American W80 warhead. It was released by Greenpeace in a report titled \"\"Dual Use Nuclear Technology\"\". The major components and their arrangement are in the diagram, though details are almost absent; what scattered details it does include likely have intentional omissions or inaccuracies. They are labeled \"End-cap and Neutron Focus Lens\" and \"Reflector Wrap\"; the former channels neutrons to the U-235/Pu-239 Spark Plug while the latter refers to an X-ray reflector; typically a cylinder made out of an X-ray opaque material such as uranium with the primary and secondary at either end. It does not reflect like a mirror; instead, it gets heated to a high temperature by the X-ray flux from the primary, then it emits more evenly spread X-rays that travel to the secondary, causing what is known as radiation implosion. In Ivy Mike, gold was used as a coating over the uranium to enhance the blackbody effect. Next comes the \"Reflector/Neutron Gun Carriage\". The reflector seals the gap between the Neutron Focus Lens (in the center) and the outer casing near the primary. It separates the primary from the secondary and performs the same function as the previous reflector. There are about six neutron guns (seen here from Sandia National Laboratories) each poking through the outer edge of the reflector with one end in each section; all are clamped to the carriage and arranged more or less evenly around the casing's circumference. The neutron guns are tilted so the neutron emitting end of each gun end is pointed towards the central axis of the bomb. Neutrons from each neutron gun pass through and are focused by the neutron focus lens towards the centre of primary in order to boost the initial fissioning of the plutonium. A \"polystyrene Polarizer/Plasma Source\" is also shown (see below).\n\nThe first U.S. government document to mention the interstage was only recently released to the public promoting the 2004 initiation of the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program. A graphic includes blurbs describing the potential advantage of a RRW on a part by part level, with the interstage blurb saying a new design would replace \"toxic, brittle material\" and \"expensive 'special' material... [which require] unique facilities\". The \"toxic, brittle material\" is widely assumed to be beryllium which fits that description and would also moderate the neutron flux from the primary. Some material to absorb and re-radiate the X-rays in a particular manner may also be used.\n\nCandidates for the \"special material\" are polystyrene and a substance called \"FOGBANK\", an unclassified codename. FOGBANK's composition is classified, though aerogel has been suggested as a possibility. It was first used in thermonuclear weapons with the W-76 thermonuclear warhead, and produced at a plant in the Y-12 Complex at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for use in the W-76. Production of FOGBANK lapsed after the W-76 production run ended. The W-76 Life Extension Program required more FOGBANK to be made. This was complicated by the fact that the original FOGBANK's properties weren't fully documented, so a massive effort was mounted to re-invent the process. An impurity crucial to the properties of the old FOGBANK was omitted during the new process. Only close analysis of new and old batches revealed the nature of that impurity. The manufacturing process used acetonitrile as a solvent, which led to at least three evacuations of the FOGBANK plant in 2006. Widely used in the petroleum and pharmaceutical industries, acetonitrile is flammable and toxic. Y-12 is the sole producer of FOGBANK.\n\nA simplified summary of the above explanation is:\n\n\nThermonuclear weapons may or may not use a boosted primary stage, use different types of fusion fuel, and may surround the fusion fuel with beryllium (or another neutron reflecting material) instead of depleted uranium to prevent early premature fission from occurring before the secondary is optimally compressed.\n\nThe basic idea of the Teller–Ulam configuration is that each \"stage\" would undergo fission or fusion (or both) and release energy, much of which would be transferred to another stage to trigger it. How exactly the energy is \"transported\" from the \"primary\" to the \"secondary\" has been the subject of some disagreement in the open press, but is thought to be transmitted through the X-rays and Gamma rays that are emitted from the fissioning \"primary\". This energy is then used to compress the \"secondary\". The crucial detail of \"how\" the X-rays create the pressure is the main remaining disputed point in the unclassified press. There are three proposed theories:\n\nThe radiation pressure exerted by the large quantity of X-ray photons inside the closed casing might be enough to compress the secondary. Electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays or light carries momentum and exerts a force on any surface it strikes. The pressure of radiation at the intensities seen in everyday life, such as sunlight striking a surface, is usually imperceptible, but at the extreme intensities found in a thermonuclear bomb the pressure is enormous.\n\nFor two thermonuclear bombs for which the general size and primary characteristics are well understood, the Ivy Mike test bomb and the modern W-80 cruise missile warhead variant of the W-61 design, the radiation pressure was calculated to be 73 million bar (atmospheres) (7.3 T Pa) for the Ivy Mike design and 1,400 million bar (140 TPa) for the W-80.\n\nFoam plasma pressure is the concept that Chuck Hansen introduced during the Progressive case, based on research that located declassified documents listing special foams as liner components within the radiation case of thermonuclear weapons.\n\nThe sequence of firing the weapon (with the foam) would be as follows:\nThis would complete the fission-fusion-fission sequence. Fusion, unlike fission, is relatively \"clean\"—it releases energy but no harmful radioactive products or large amounts of nuclear fallout. The fission reactions though, especially the last fission reactions, release a tremendous amount of fission products and fallout. If the last fission stage is omitted, by replacing the uranium tamper with one made of lead, for example, the overall explosive force is reduced by approximately half but the amount of fallout is relatively low. The neutron bomb is a hydrogen bomb with an intentionally thin tamper, allowing most of the fast fusion neutrons as possible to escape.\n\nCurrent technical criticisms of the idea of \"foam plasma pressure\" focus on unclassified analysis from similar high energy physics fields that indicate that the pressure produced by such a plasma would only be a \"small multiplier\" of the basic photon pressure within the radiation case, and also that the known foam materials intrinsically have a very low absorption efficiency of the gamma ray and X-ray radiation from the primary. Most of the energy produced would be absorbed by either the walls of the radiation case or the tamper around the secondary. Analyzing the effects of that absorbed energy led to the third mechanism: ablation.\n\nThe outer casing of the secondary assembly is called the \"tamper-pusher\". The purpose of a tamper in an implosion bomb is to delay the expansion of the reacting fuel supply (which is very hot dense plasma) until the fuel is fully consumed and the explosion runs to completion. The same tamper material serves also as a pusher in that it is the medium by which the outside pressure (force acting on the surface area of the secondary) is transferred to the mass of fusion fuel.\nThe proposed tamper-pusher ablation mechanism posits that the outer layers of the thermonuclear secondary's tamper-pusher are heated so extremely by the primary's X-ray flux that they expand violently and ablate away (fly off). Because total momentum is conserved, this mass of high velocity ejecta impels the rest of the tamper-pusher to recoil inwards with tremendous force, crushing the fusion fuel and the spark plug. The tamper-pusher is built robustly enough to insulate the fusion fuel from the extreme heat outside; otherwise the compression would be spoiled.\n\nRough calculations for the basic ablation effect are relatively simple: the energy from the primary is distributed evenly onto all of the surfaces within the outer radiation case, with the components coming to a thermal equilibrium, and the effects of that thermal energy are then analyzed. The energy is mostly deposited within about one X-ray optical thickness of the tamper/pusher outer surface, and the temperature of that layer can then be calculated. The velocity at which the surface then expands outwards is calculated and, from a basic Newtonian momentum balance, the velocity at which the rest of the tamper implodes inwards.\n\nApplying the more detailed form of those calculations to the Ivy Mike device yields vaporized pusher gas expansion velocity of 290 kilometers per second and an implosion velocity of perhaps 400 kilometers per second if 3/4 of the total tamper/pusher mass is ablated off, the most energy efficient proportion. For the W-80 the gas expansion velocity is roughly 410 kilometers per second and the implosion velocity 570 kilometers per second. The pressure due to the ablating material is calculated to be 5.3 billion bar (530 T Pa) in the Ivy Mike device and 64 billion bar (6.4 P Pa) in the W-80 device.\n\nComparing the three mechanisms proposed, it can be seen that:\n\nThe calculated ablation pressure is one order of magnitude greater than the higher proposed plasma pressures and nearly two orders of magnitude greater than calculated radiation pressure. No mechanism to avoid the absorption of energy into the radiation case wall and the secondary tamper has been suggested, making ablation apparently unavoidable. The other mechanisms appear to be unneeded.\n\nUnited States Department of Defense official declassification reports indicate that foamed plastic materials are or may be used in radiation case liners, and despite the low direct plasma pressure they may be of use in delaying the ablation until energy has distributed evenly and a sufficient fraction has reached the secondary's tamper/pusher.\n\nRichard Rhodes' book \"Dark Sun\" stated that a layer of plastic foam was fixed to the lead liner of the inside of the Ivy Mike steel casing using copper nails. Rhodes quotes several designers of that bomb explaining that the plastic foam layer inside the outer case is to delay ablation and thus recoil of the outer case: if the foam were not there, metal would ablate from the inside of the outer case with a large impulse, causing the casing to recoil outwards rapidly. The purpose of the casing is to contain the explosion for as long as possible, allowing as much X-ray ablation of the metallic surface of the secondary stage as possible, so it compresses the secondary efficiently, maximizing the fusion yield. Plastic foam has a low density, so causes a smaller impulse when it ablates than metal does.\n\nA number of possible variations to the weapon design have been proposed:\n\nTwo special variations exist that will be discussed in a subsequent section: the cryogenically cooled liquid deuterium device used for the Ivy Mike test, and the putative design of the W88 nuclear warhead—a small, MIRVed version of the Teller–Ulam configuration with a prolate (egg or watermelon shaped) primary and an elliptical secondary.\n\nMost bombs do not apparently have tertiary \"stages\"—that is, third compression stage(s), which are additional fusion stages compressed by a previous fusion stage. (The fissioning of the last blanket of uranium, which provides about half the yield in large bombs, does not count as a \"stage\" in this terminology.)\n\nThe U.S. tested three-stage bombs in several explosions (see Operation Redwing) but is thought to have fielded only one such tertiary model, i.e., a bomb in which a fission stage, followed by a fusion stage, finally compresses yet another fusion stage. This U.S. design was the heavy but highly efficient (i.e., nuclear weapon yield per unit bomb weight) 25 Mt B41 nuclear bomb. The Soviet Union is thought to have used multiple stages (including more than one tertiary fusion stage) in their 50 megaton (100 Mt in intended use) Tsar Bomba (however, as with other bombs, the fissionable jacket could be replaced with lead in such a bomb, and in this one, for demonstration, it was). If any hydrogen bombs have been made from configurations other than those based on the Teller–Ulam design, the fact of it is not publicly known. (A possible exception to this is the Soviet early \"Sloika\" design).\n\nIn essence, the Teller–Ulam configuration relies on at least two instances of implosion occurring: first, the conventional (chemical) explosives in the primary would compress the fissile core, resulting in a fission explosion many times more powerful than that which chemical explosives could achieve alone (first stage). Second, the radiation from the fissioning of the primary would be used to compress and ignite the secondary fusion stage, resulting in a fusion explosion many times more powerful than the fission explosion alone. This chain of compression could conceivably be continued with an arbitrary number of tertiary fusion stages, each igniting more fusion fuel in the next stage although this is debated (see more: Arbitrarily large yield debate). Finally, efficient bombs (but not so-called neutron bombs) end with the fissioning of the final natural uranium tamper, something that could not normally be achieved without the neutron flux provided by the fusion reactions in secondary or tertiary stages. Such designs are suggested to be capable of being scaled up to an arbitrary large yield (with apparently as many fusion stages as desired), potentially to the level of a \"doomsday device.\" However, usually such weapons were not more than a dozen megatons, which was generally considered enough to destroy even most hardened practical targets (for example, a control facility such as the Cheyenne Mountain Complex). Even such large bombs have been replaced by smaller-yield bunker buster type nuclear bombs (see more: nuclear bunker buster).\n\nAs discussed above, for destruction of cities and non-hardened targets, breaking the mass of a single missile payload down into smaller MIRV bombs, in order to spread the energy of the explosions into a \"pancake\" area, is far more efficient in terms of area-destruction per unit of bomb energy. This also applies to single bombs deliverable by cruise missile or other system, such as a bomber, resulting in most operational warheads in the U.S. program having yields of less than 500 kilotons.\n\nThe idea of a thermonuclear fusion bomb ignited by a smaller fission bomb was first proposed by Enrico Fermi to his colleague Edward Teller in 1941 at the start of what would become the Manhattan Project. Teller spent most of the Manhattan Project attempting to figure out how to make the design work, to some degree neglecting his assigned work on the fission bomb program. His difficult and devil's advocate attitude in discussions led Robert Oppenheimer to sidetrack him and other \"problem\" physicists into the super program to smooth his way.\n\nStanislaw Ulam, a co-worker of Teller, made the first key conceptual leaps towards a workable fusion design. Ulam's two innovations that rendered the fusion bomb practical were that compression of the thermonuclear fuel before extreme heating was a practical path towards the conditions needed for fusion, and the idea of staging or placing a separate thermonuclear component outside a fission primary component, and somehow using the primary to compress the secondary. Teller then realized that the gamma and X-ray radiation produced in the primary could transfer enough energy into the secondary to create a successful implosion and fusion burn, if the whole assembly was wrapped in a \"hohlraum\" or radiation case. Teller and his various proponents and detractors later disputed the degree to which Ulam had contributed to the theories underlying this mechanism. Indeed, shortly before his death, and in a last-ditch effort to discredit Ulam's contributions, Teller claimed that one of his own \"graduate students\" had proposed the mechanism.\n\nThe \"George\" shot of Operation Greenhouse of 9 May 1951 tested the basic concept for the first time on a very small scale. As the first successful (uncontrolled) release of nuclear fusion energy, which made up a small fraction of the 225 kt total yield, it raised expectations to a near certainty that the concept would work.\n\nOn November 1, 1952, the Teller–Ulam configuration was tested at full scale in the \"Ivy Mike\" shot at an island in the Enewetak Atoll, with a yield of 10.4 megatons (over 450 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki during World War II). The device, dubbed the \"Sausage\", used an extra-large fission bomb as a \"trigger\" and liquid deuterium—kept in its liquid state by 20 short tons (18 metric tons) of cryogenic equipment—as its fusion fuel, and weighed around 80 short tons (70 metric tons) altogether.\n\nThe liquid deuterium fuel of Ivy Mike was impractical for a deployable weapon, and the next advance was to use a solid lithium deuteride fusion fuel instead. In 1954 this was tested in the \"Castle Bravo\" shot (the device was code-named \"Shrimp\"), which had a yield of 15 megatons (2.5 times expected) and is the largest U.S. bomb ever tested.\n\nEfforts in the United States soon shifted towards developing miniaturized Teller–Ulam weapons that could fit into intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. By 1960, with the W47 warhead deployed on Polaris ballistic missile submarines, megaton-class warheads were as small as 18 inches (0.5 m) in diameter and 720 pounds (320 kg) in weight. Further innovation in miniaturizing warheads was accomplished by the mid-1970s, when versions of the Teller–Ulam design were created that could fit ten or more warheads on the end of a small MIRVed missile (see the section on the W88 below).\n\nThe Soviet thermonuclear weapons program was aided heavily by Klaus Fuchs. Fuchs’ most valuable contribution to the Soviet weapons program concerned the hydrogen bomb. The idea of a hydrogen bomb arose from discussions between Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller in 1941. From 1943 Teller lectured at Los Alamos on what he called the \"super\". Following their meeting, Fermi was convinced by Teller to present a series of lectures detailing the current state of research into thermonuclear weapons. In September 1945 Fuchs passed a synopsis of these lectures to the Soviets. This information was important to the Soviets, but not solely for the information about the US bomb project. The importance of this material was in that it confirmed that the United States were working on their own thermonuclear weapon research. Although the information provided by Fuchs regarding the thermonuclear weapons research was not seen as entirely beneficial, it still provided the Soviet Union with knowledge such as the properties of tritium. Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen with two neutrons, which allows for more efficient fusion reactions to occur during the detonation of a nuclear weapon. Discovering the properties of this radioactive material would allow the Soviet Union to develop a more powerful weapon that requires less fuel. Following Fuchs's return, experts from the Soviet Union spent a great deal of time researching his findings for themselves. Even though the Soviets did obtain some original ideas, the findings of this research served to confirm Fuchs's notes from the American lectures on the matter. After his return to England in mid-1946, Fuchs was not again in touch with Soviet intelligence until September 1947, when his controller confirmed the Soviet interest in thermonuclear weapons. In response Fuchs provided details of the \"ongoing theoretical superbomb studies in the U.S. under the direction of Teller and Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago.\" Fuchs obtained information regardless of the American McMahon Act, which prevented Anglo-American cooperation on nuclear weapons research. Under this act, Fuchs did not have routine access to American collaborators like Fermi and Teller. Fuchs was very close to Teller at Los Alamos, and while there Fuchs had worked on thermonuclear weapons. As Teller later recalled, \"he [Fuchs] talked with me and others frequently in depth about our intensive efforts… it was easy and pleasant to discuss my work with him. He also made impressive contributions, and I learned many technical facts from him.\" The information Fuchs obtained energized the Soviets to direct new intelligence activities against research in Chicago. In February 1948 the Soviet Union formally began its hydrogen bomb program. A month later Fuchs again met with Feklisov, an event which \"played an exceptional role in the subsequent course of the Soviet thermonuclear bomb program.\" A report of June 1953 warned that, although no indication of Soviet development of hydrogen bombs had been found, \"Soviet research, development and even field testing of thermonuclear reactions based on the disclosures of Fuchs may take place by mid-1953.\" U.S. intelligence thus recognized for the first time that Fuchs' material held invaluable information for the Soviet thermonuclear weapons program.\n\nThe first Soviet fusion design, developed by Andrei Sakharov and Vitaly Ginzburg in 1949 (before the Soviets had a working fission bomb), was dubbed the \"Sloika\", after a Russian layer cake, and was not of the Teller–Ulam configuration. It used alternating layers of fissile material and lithium deuteride fusion fuel spiked with tritium (this was later dubbed Sakharov's \"First Idea\"). Though nuclear fusion might have been technically achievable, it did not have the scaling property of a \"staged\" weapon. Thus, such a design could not produce thermonuclear weapons whose explosive yields could be made arbitrarily large (unlike U.S. designs at that time). The fusion layer wrapped around the fission core could only moderately multiply the fission energy (modern Teller–Ulam designs can multiply it 30-fold). Additionally, the whole fusion stage had to be imploded by conventional explosives, along with the fission core, substantially multiplying the amount of chemical explosives needed.\n\nThe first Sloika design test, RDS-6s, was detonated in 1953 with a yield equivalent to 400 kilotons of TNT (15–20% from fusion). Attempts to use a \"Sloika\" design to achieve megaton-range results proved unfeasible. After the United States tested the \"Ivy Mike\" thermonuclear device in November 1952, proving that a multimegaton bomb could be created, the Soviets searched for an additional design. The \"Second Idea\", as Sakharov referred to it in his memoirs, was a previous proposal by Ginzburg in November 1948 to use lithium deuteride in the bomb, which would, in the course of being bombarded by neutrons, produce tritium and free deuterium. In late 1953 physicist Viktor Davidenko achieved the first breakthrough, that of keeping the \"primary\" and \"secondary\" parts of the bombs in separate pieces (\"staging\"). The next breakthrough was discovered and developed by Sakharov and Yakov Zel'dovich, that of using the X-rays from the fission bomb to compress the \"secondary\" before fusion (\"radiation implosion\"), in early 1954. Sakharov's \"Third Idea\", as the Teller–Ulam design was known in the USSR, was tested in the shot \"RDS-37\" in November 1955 with a yield of 1.6 megatons.\n\nThe Soviets demonstrated the power of the \"staging\" concept in October 1961, when they detonated the massive and unwieldy \"Tsar Bomba\", a 50 megaton hydrogen bomb that derived almost 97% of its energy from fusion. It was the largest nuclear weapon developed and tested by any country.\n\nIn 1954 work began at Aldermaston to develop the British fusion bomb, with Sir William Penney in charge of the project. British knowledge on how to make a thermonuclear fusion bomb was rudimentary, and at the time the United States was not exchanging any nuclear knowledge because of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. However, the British were allowed to observe the American Castle tests and used sampling aircraft in the mushroom clouds, providing them with clear, direct evidence of the compression produced in the secondary stages by radiation implosion.\n\nBecause of these difficulties, in 1955 British prime minister Anthony Eden agreed to a secret plan, whereby if the Aldermaston scientists failed or were greatly delayed in developing the fusion bomb, it would be replaced by an extremely large fission bomb.\n\nIn 1957 the Operation Grapple tests were carried out. The first test, Green Granite was a prototype fusion bomb, but failed to produce equivalent yields compared to the Americans and Soviets, achieving only approximately 300 kilotons. The second test Orange Herald was the modified fission bomb and produced 720 kilotons—making it the largest fission explosion ever. At the time almost everyone (including the pilots of the plane that dropped it) thought that this was a fusion bomb. This bomb was put into service in 1958. A second prototype fusion bomb Purple Granite was used in the third test, but only produced approximately 150 kilotons.\n\nA second set of tests was scheduled, with testing recommencing in September 1957. The first test was based on a \"… new simpler design. A two stage thermonuclear bomb that had a much more powerful trigger\". This test Grapple X Round C was exploded on November 8 and yielded approximately 1.8 megatons. On April 28, 1958 a bomb was dropped that yielded 3 megatons—Britain's most powerful test. Two final air burst tests on September 2 and September 11, 1958, dropped smaller bombs that yielded around 1 megaton each.\n\nAmerican observers had been invited to these kinds of tests. After Britain's successful detonation of a megaton-range device (and thus demonstrating a practical understanding of the Teller–Ulam design \"secret\"), the United States agreed to exchange some of its nuclear designs with the United Kingdom, leading to the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement. Instead of continuing with its own design, the British were given access to the design of the smaller American Mk 28 warhead and were able to manufacture copies.\n\nThe United Kingdom had worked closely with the Americans on the Manhattan Project. British access to nuclear weapons information was cut-off by the United States at one point due to concerns about Soviet espionage. Full cooperation was not reestablished until an agreement governing the handling of secret information and other issues was signed.\n\nMao Zedong decided to begin a Chinese nuclear-weapons program during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1954–1955. The People's Republic of China detonated its first hydrogen (thermonuclear) bomb on June 17, 1967, 32 months after detonating its first fission weapon, with a yield of 3.31 Mt. It took place in the Lop Nor Test Site, in northwest China. China had received extensive technical help from the Soviet Union to jump-start their nuclear program, but by 1960, the rift between the Soviet Union and China had become so great that the Soviet Union ceased all assistance to China.\n\nA story in \"The New York Times\" by William Broad reported that in 1995, a supposed Chinese double agent delivered information indicating that China knew secret details of the U.S. W88 warhead, supposedly through espionage. (This line of investigation eventually resulted in the abortive trial of Wen Ho Lee.)\n\nFrance's journey in building nuclear weapons began prior to World War II in 1939. The development of nuclear weapons was slowed during the country's German invasion. The United States did not want France to acquire expert knowledge about nuclear weaponry, which ultimately led to the Alsos Mission. The missions followed closely behind the advancing forward-front to obtain information about how close Germany was to building an atomic weapon. Following the surrender of the Nazis, Germany was divided into \"zones of occupation\". The \"zone\" given to the French was suspected to contain several nuclear research facilities. The United States conducted Operation Harborage to seize any and all information about nuclear weaponry from the French. The Operation strategized to have American troops intercede advancing French army, allowing the Americans to seize any German scientists or records as well as destroy the remaining functional facilities.\n\nIn 1945, the French Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique, CEA) was founded under Charles de Gaulle; the CEA served as the country's atomic energy authority, overseeing commercial, military, and scientific uses of atomic power. However it was not until 1952 that a tangible goal of building plutonium reactors progressed. Two years later, a reactor was being built and a plutonium separating plant began construction shortly after. In 1954 the question about continuing to explore building an atomic bomb was raised. The French cabinet seemed to be favoring less the building of an atomic bomb. Ultimately, the Prime Minister decided to continue efforts developing an atomic bomb in secret. In late 1956, tasks were delegated between the CEA and Defense Ministry to propel atomic development such as finding a test site, providing the necessary uranium, and physical device assembly.\n\nCharles de Gaulle returned to power and was elected France's Fifth Republic's first president in 1958. De Gaulle, a strong believer in the nuclear weapons program, approved the country's first nuclear test to take place in one of the early months of 1960. The country's first nuclear explosion took place on 13 February at Reggane Oasis in the Sahara Desert in French Algeria of the time. It was called \"Gerboise Bleue\", translating to \"Blue jerboa\". The first explosion was detonated at a tower height of 105 meters. The bomb used a plutonium implosion design with a yield of 70 kilotons. The Reggane Oasis test site was used for three more atmospheric tests before testing activity moved to a second site, Ecker, to carry out a total of 13 underground tests into 1967.\n\nThe French nuclear testing site was moved to the unpopulated French atolls in the Pacific Ocean. The first test conducted at these new sites was the \"Canopus\" test in the Fangataufa atoll in French Polynesia on 24 August 1968, the country's first multistage thermonuclear weapon test. The bomb was detonated from a balloon at a height of 520 meters. The result of this test was significant atmospheric contamination. Very little is known about France's development of the Teller–Ulam design, beyond the fact that France detonated a 2.6 Mt device in the 'Canopus\" test. France reportedly had great difficulty with its initial development of the Teller-Ulam design, but it later overcame these, and is believed to have nuclear weapons equal in sophistication to the other major nuclear powers.\n\nFrance and China did not sign or ratify the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, which banned nuclear test explosions in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. Between 1966 and 1996 France carried out more than 190 nuclear tests. France's final nuclear test took place on January 27, 1996, and then the country dismantled its Polynesian test sites. France signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that same year, and then ratified the Treaty within two years.\n\nFrance confirmed that its nuclear arsenal contains about 300 warheads, carried by submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and fighter-bombers in 2015. France has four Triomphant-class ballistic missile submarines. One ballistic missile submarine is deployed in the deep ocean, but a total of three must be in operational use at all times. The three older submarines are armed with 16 M45 missiles. The newest submarine, \"Le Terrible\", was commissioned in 2010, and it has M51 missiles capable of carrying TN 75 thermonuclear warheads. The air fleet is four squadrons at four different bases. In total, there are 23 Mirage 2000N aircraft and 20 Rafales capable of carrying nuclear warheads. The M51.1 missiles are intended to be replaced with the new M51.2 warhead beginning in 2016, which has a 3,000 km greater range than the M51.1.\n\nPresident François Hollande announced 180 billion euros would be used from the annual defense budget to improve the country's nuclear deterrence. France contains 13 International Monitoring System facilities that monitor for nuclear explosive activity on Earth through the use of seismic, infrasound, and hydroacoustic monitors.\n\nFrance also has about 60 air-launched missiles tipped with TN 80/TN 81 warheads with a yield of about 300 kilotons each. France's nuclear program has been carefully designed to ensure that these weapons remain usable decades into the future. Currently, France is no longer deliberately producing critical mass materials such as plutonium and enriched uranium, but it still relies on nuclear energy for electricity, with Pu-239 as a byproduct.\n\nOn May 11, 1998, India announced that it had detonated a thermonuclear bomb in its Operation Shakti tests (\"Shakti-I\", specifically). Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, a Pakistani nuclear physicist, asserted that if Shakti-I had been a thermonuclear test, the device had failed to fire. However, Dr. Harold M. Agnew, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said that India's assertion of having detonated a staged thermonuclear bomb was believable. India says that their thermonuclear device was tested at a controlled yield of 45 kt because of the close proximity of the Khetolai village at about 5 km, to ensure that the houses in that village do not suffer significant damage. Another cited reason was that radioactivity released from yields significantly more than 45 Kilotons might not have been contained fully. After the Pokhran-II tests, Dr. Rajagopal Chidambaram, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India said that India has the capability to build thermonuclear bombs of any yield at will.\n\nThe yield of India's hydrogen bomb test remains highly debatable among the Indian science community and the international scholars. The question of politicisation and disputes between Indian scientists further complicated the matter.\n\nIn an interview in August 2009, the director for the 1998 test site preparations, Dr. K. Santhanam claimed that the yield of the thermonuclear explosion was lower than expected and that India should therefore not rush into signing the CTBT. Other Indian scientists involved in the test have disputed Dr. K. Santhanam's claim, arguing that Santhanam's claims are unscientific. British seismologist Roger Clarke argued that the magnitudes suggested a combined yield of up to 60 kilotonnes, consistent with the Indian announced total yield of 56 kilotonnes. U.S. seismologist Jack Evernden has argued that for correct estimation of yields, one should ‘account properly for geological and seismological differences between test sites’.\n\nIndia officially maintains that it can build thermonuclear weapons of various yields up to around 200 kilotons on the basis of the Shakti-1 thermonuclear test.\n\nIsrael is alleged to possess thermonuclear weapons of the Teller–Ulam design, but it is not known to have tested any nuclear devices, although it is widely speculated that the Vela Incident of 1979 may have been a joint Israeli–South African nuclear test.\n\nIt is well established that Edward Teller advised and guided the Israeli establishment on general nuclear matters for some twenty years. Between 1964 and 1967, Teller made six visits to Israel where he lectured at the Tel Aviv University on general topics in theoretical physics. It took him a year to convince the CIA about Israel's capability and finally in 1976, Carl Duckett of the CIA testified to the U.S. Congress, after receiving credible information from an \"American scientist\" (Teller), on Israel's nuclear capability. During the 1990s, Teller eventually confirmed speculations in the media that it was during his visits in the 1960s that he concluded that Israel was in possession of nuclear weapons. After he conveyed the matter to the higher level of the U.S. government, Teller reportedly said: \"They [Israel] have it, and they were clever enough to trust their research and not to test, they know that to test would get them into trouble.\"\n\nAccording to the scientific data received and published by PAEC, the Corps of Engineers, and Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL), in May 1998, Pakistan carried out six underground nuclear tests in Chagai Hills and Kharan Desert in Balochistan Province (see the code-names of the tests, \"Chagai-I\" and \"Chagai-II\"). None of these boosted fission devices was the thermonuclear weapon design, according to KRL and PAEC.\n\nNorth Korea claimed to have tested its miniaturised thermonuclear bomb on 6 January 2016. North Korea's first three nuclear tests (2006, 2009 and 2013) were relatively low yield and do not appear to have been of a thermonuclear weapon design. In 2013, the South Korean Defense Ministry speculated that North Korea may be trying to develop a \"hydrogen bomb\" and such a device may be North Korea's next weapons test. In January 2016, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, although only a magnitude 5.1 seismic event was detected at the time of the test, a similar magnitude to the 2013 test of a 6–9 kt atomic bomb. These seismic recordings cast doubt upon North Korea's claim that a hydrogen bomb was tested and suggest it was a non-fusion nuclear test.\n\nOn 3 September 2017, the country's state media reported that a hydrogen bomb test was conducted which resulted in \"perfect success\". According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the blast resulted in an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.3, 10 times more powerful than previous nuclear tests conducted by North Korea. U.S. Intelligence released an early assessment that the yield estimate was 140 kilotons, with an uncertainty range of 70 to 280 kilotons.\n\nOn 12 September, NORSAR revised its estimate of the earthquake magnitude upward to 6.1, matching that of the CTBTO, but less powerful than the USGS estimate of 6.3. Its yield estimate was revised to 250 kilotons, while noting the estimate had some uncertainty and an undisclosed margin of error.\n\nOn 13 September, an analysis of before and after synthetic-aperture radar satellite imagery of the test site was published suggesting the test occurred under of rock and the yield \"could have been in excess of 300 kilotons\".\n\nThe Teller–Ulam design was for many years considered one of the top nuclear secrets, and even today it is not discussed in any detail by official publications with origins \"behind the fence\" of classification. United States Department of Energy (DOE) policy has been, and continues to be, that they do not acknowledge when \"leaks\" occur, because doing so would acknowledge the accuracy of the supposed leaked information. Aside from images of the warhead casing, most information in the public domain about this design is relegated to a few terse statements by the DOE and the work of a few individual investigators.\n\nIn 1972 the United States government declassified a document stating \"[I]n thermonuclear (TN) weapons, a fission 'primary' is used to trigger a TN reaction in thermonuclear fuel referred to as a 'secondary'\", and in 1979 added, \"[I]n thermonuclear weapons, radiation from a fission explosive can be contained and used to transfer energy to compress and ignite a physically separate component containing thermonuclear fuel.\" To this latter sentence the US government specified that \"\"Any elaboration of this statement will be classified\".\" The only information that may pertain to the \"spark plug\" was declassified in 1991: \"Fact that fissile or fissionable materials are present in some secondaries, material unidentified, location unspecified, use unspecified, and weapons undesignated.\" In 1998 the DOE declassified the statement that \"The fact that materials may be present in channels and the term 'channel filler,' with no elaboration\", which may refer to the polystyrene foam (or an analogous substance).\n\nWhether these statements vindicate some or all of the models presented above is up for interpretation, and official U.S. government releases about the technical details of nuclear weapons have been purposely equivocating in the past (see, e.g., Smyth Report). Other information, such as the types of fuel used in some of the early weapons, has been declassified, though precise technical information has not been.\n\nMost of the current ideas on the workings of the Teller–Ulam design came into public awareness after the Department of Energy (DOE) attempted to censor a magazine article by U.S. antiweapons activist Howard Morland in 1979 on the \"secret of the hydrogen bomb\". In 1978, Morland had decided that discovering and exposing this \"last remaining secret\" would focus attention onto the arms race and allow citizens to feel empowered to question official statements on the importance of nuclear weapons and nuclear secrecy. Most of Morland's ideas about how the weapon worked were compiled from highly accessible sources—the drawings that most inspired his approach came from none other than the \"Encyclopedia Americana\". Morland also interviewed (often informally) many former Los Alamos scientists (including Teller and Ulam, though neither gave him any useful information), and used a variety of interpersonal strategies to encourage informative responses from them (i.e., asking questions such as \"Do they still use spark plugs?\" even if he was not aware what the latter term specifically referred to).\n\nMorland eventually concluded that the \"secret\" was that the \"primary\" and \"secondary\" were kept separate and that radiation pressure from the \"primary\" compressed the \"secondary\" before igniting it. When an early draft of the article, to be published in \"The Progressive\" magazine, was sent to the DOE after falling into the hands of a professor who was opposed to Morland's goal, the DOE requested that the article not be published, and pressed for a temporary injunction. The DOE argued that Morland's information was (1) likely derived from classified sources, (2) if not derived from classified sources, itself counted as \"secret\" information under the \"born secret\" clause of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, and (3) was dangerous and would encourage nuclear proliferation.\n\nMorland and his lawyers disagreed on all points, but the injunction was granted, as the judge in the case felt that it was safer to grant the injunction and allow Morland, et al., to appeal, which they did in \"United States v. The Progressive\" (1979).\n\nThrough a variety of more complicated circumstances, the DOE case began to wane as it became clear that some of the data they were attempting to claim as \"secret\" had been published in a students' encyclopedia a few years earlier. After another H-bomb speculator, Chuck Hansen, had his own ideas about the \"secret\" (quite different from Morland's) published in a Wisconsin newspaper, the DOE claimed that \"The Progressive\" case was moot, dropped its suit, and allowed the magazine to publish its article, which it did in November 1979. Morland had by then, however, changed his opinion of how the bomb worked, suggesting that a foam medium (the polystyrene) rather than radiation pressure was used to compress the \"secondary\", and that in the \"secondary\" there was a \"spark plug\" of fissile material as well. He published these changes, based in part on the proceedings of the appeals trial, as a short erratum in \"The Progressive\" a month later. In 1981, Morland published a book about his experience, describing in detail the train of thought that led him to his conclusions about the \"secret\".\n\nMorland's work is interpreted as being at least partially correct because the DOE had sought to censor it, one of the few times they violated their usual approach of not acknowledging \"secret\" material that had been released; however, to what degree it lacks information, or has incorrect information, is not known with any confidence. The difficulty that a number of nations had in developing the Teller–Ulam design (even when they apparently understood the design, such as with the United Kingdom), makes it somewhat unlikely that this simple information alone is what provides the ability to manufacture thermonuclear weapons. Nevertheless, the ideas put forward by Morland in 1979 have been the basis for all the current speculation on the Teller–Ulam design.\n\nIn January 1986, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev publicly proposed a three-stage program for abolishing the world's nuclear weapons by the end of the 20th century. Two years before his death in 1989, Andrei Sakharov's comments at a scientists’ forum helped begin the process for the elimination of thousands of nuclear ballistic missiles from the US and Soviet arsenals. Sakharov (1921–89) was recruited into the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons program in 1948, a year after he completed his doctorate. In 1949 the US detected the first Soviet test of a fission bomb, and the two countries embarked on a desperate race to design a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb that was a thousand times more powerful. Like his US counterparts, Sakharov justified his H-bomb work by pointing to the danger of the other country's achieving a monopoly. But also like some of the US scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project, he felt a responsibility to inform his nation's leadership and then the world about the dangers from nuclear weapons. Sakharov's first attempt to influence policy was brought about by his concern about possible genetic damage from long-lived radioactive carbon-14 created in the atmosphere from nitrogen-14 by the enormous fluxes of neutrons released in H-bomb tests. In 1968, a friend suggested that Sakharov write an essay about the role of the intelligentsia in world affairs. Self-publishing was the method at the time for spreading unapproved manuscripts in the Soviet Union. Many readers would create multiple copies by typing with multiple sheets of paper interleaved with carbon paper. One copy of Sakharov's essay, \"Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom\", was smuggled out of the Soviet Union and published by the New York Times. More than 18 million reprints were produced during 1968–69. After the essay was published, Sakharov was barred from returning to work in the nuclear weapons program and took a research position in Moscow. In 1980, after an interview with the New York Times in which he denounced the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the government put him beyond the reach of Western media by exiling him and his wife to Gorky. In March 1985, Gorbachev became general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. More than a year and a half later, he persuaded the Politburo, the party's executive committee, to allow Sakharov and Bonner to return to Moscow. Sakharov was elected as an opposition member to the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies in 1989. Later that year he had a cardiac arrhythmia and died in his apartment. He left behind a draft of a new Soviet constitution that emphasized democracy and human rights.\n\nOn 5 February 1958, during a training mission flown by a B-47, a Mark 15 nuclear bomb, also known as the Tybee Bomb, was lost off the coast of Tybee Island near Savannah, Georgia. The bomb was thought by the Department of Energy to lie buried under several feet of silt at the bottom of Wassaw Sound.\n\nOn 17 January 1966, a fatal collision occurred between a B-52G and a KC-135 Stratotanker over Palomares, Spain. The conventional explosives in two of the Mk28-type hydrogen bombs detonated upon impact with the ground, dispersing plutonium over nearby farms. A third bomb landed intact near Palomares while the fourth fell 12 miles (19 km) off the coast into the Mediterranean sea.\n\nOn 21 January 1968, a B-52G, with four B28FI thermonuclear bombs aboard as part of Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while attempting an emergency landing at Thule Air Base in Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination. One of the bombs remains lost.\n\nIn his 1995 book \"Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb\", author Richard Rhodes describes in detail the internal components of the \"Ivy Mike\" \"Sausage\" device, based on information obtained from extensive interviews with the scientists and engineers who assembled it. According to Rhodes, the actual mechanism for the compression of the secondary was a combination of the radiation pressure, foam plasma pressure, and tamper-pusher ablation theories described above; the radiation from the primary heated the polyethylene foam lining the casing to a plasma, which then re-radiated radiation into the secondary's pusher, causing its surface to ablate and driving it inwards, compressing the secondary, igniting the sparkplug, and causing the fusion reaction. The general applicability of this principle is unclear.\n\nIn 1999 a reporter for the \"San Jose Mercury News\" reported that the U.S. W88 nuclear warhead, a small MIRVed warhead used on the Trident II SLBM, had a prolate (egg or watermelon shaped) \"primary\" (code-named \"Komodo\") and a spherical \"secondary\" (code-named \"Cursa\") inside a specially shaped radiation case (known as the \"peanut\" for its shape).\n\nThe reentry cones for the W88 and W87 are the same size, 1.75 meters (69 in) long, with a maximum diameter of 55 cm. (22 in). The higher yield of the W88 implies a larger secondary, which produces most of the yield. Putting the secondary, which is heavier than the primary, in the wider part of the cone allows it to be larger, but it also moves the center of mass aft, potentially causing aerodynamic stability problems during reentry. Dead-weight ballast must be added to the nose to move the center of mass forward.\n\nTo make the primary small enough to fit into the narrow part of the cone, its bulky insensitive high explosive charges must be replaced with more compact \"non-insensitive\" high explosives that are more hazardous to handle. The higher yield of the W88, which is the last new warhead produced by the United States, thus comes at a price of higher warhead weight and higher workplace hazard. The W88 also contains tritium, which has a half life of only 12.32 years and must be repeatedly replaced. If these stories are true, it would explain the reported higher yield of the W88, 475 kilotons, compared with only 300 kilotons for the earlier W87 warhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sentelle graduated from Enka High School in 1961, where he was a classmate of Thomas A. Furness III, who is the \"Grandfather of Virtual Reality.\" Sentelle received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1965. He received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of North Carolina School of Law in 1968. \n\nFollowing Law School, Sentelle practiced law as an associate attorney with the firm Uzzell & Dumont in Asheville, North Carolina from 1968 to 1970. He was an Assistant United States Attorney in Charlotte, North Carolina from 1970 to 1974. \n\nSentelle served as Carolina District Court Judge in Mecklenburg Country from 1974 to 1977. He stepped down from the bench in 1977 to become a partner with the law firm of Tucker, Hicks, Sentelle, Moon & Hodge in Charlotte until his appointment to Federal Court in 1985. \n\nIn addition to his practice and judicial service, Sentelle has held several teaching positions. He was a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 1977. He was a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1991 to 1992. In 1993, he taught as an adjunct professor at Florida State University College of Law. Centelle was an Adjunct Professor at the George Mason School of Law from 2002-2009.\n\nAs a result of support from Senator Jesse Helms, Sentelle was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on July 25, 1985, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina vacated by Judge Woodrow W.

{"id": "2269465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269465", "title": "Jason X", "text": "Jason X\n\nJason X is a 2001 American science fiction slasher film directed by Jim Isaac, written by Todd Farmer and starring Lexa Doig, Lisa Ryder, Chuck Campbell and Kane Hodder in his fourth and final appearance as Jason Voorhees. It is the tenth installment in the \"Friday the 13th\" film series. It introduces his futuristic counterpart, Uber Jason.\n\nConceived by Todd Farmer as the only pitch he gave to the studio, suggesting sending Jason into space as a means to advance the film series.\n\n\"Jason X\" was theatrically released in the U.S. on April 26, 2002, grossing $17 million on a budget of $11–14 million and received negative reviews from critics. It is followed by \"Freddy vs. Jason\", a crossover with the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" film series.\n\nIn the year 2010, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Government scientist Rowan LaFontaine (Lexa Doig) decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him. While Private Samuel Johnson (Jeff Geddis) places a blanket on Jason, Dr. Wimmer (David Cronenberg), Sergeant Marcus (Markus Parilo), and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason's rapid cellular regeneration and try to take Jason. They pull off the blanket covering his body, but find Johnson dead, instead. Having broken free of his restraints, Jason kills the soldiers and Wimmer. Rowan lures Jason into a cryogenic pod and activates it. Jason then ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen, spilling cryogenic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both.\n\n445 years later (2455), Earth has become too polluted to support life and humans have moved to a new planet, Earth Two. Three students, Tsunaron (Chuck Campbell), Janessa (Melyssa Ade), and Azrael (Dov Tiefenbach), are on a field trip led by Professor Braithwaite Lowe (Jonathan Potts), who is accompanied by an android, KM-14 (Lisa Ryder). They enter the Crystal Lake facility and find the still-frozen Jason and Rowan, whom they bring to their spaceship, the \"Grendel\". Also on the ship are Lowe's remaining students, Kinsa (Melody Johnson), Waylander (Derwin Jordan), and Stoney (Yani Gellman). They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue. Lowe's intern, Adrienne Thomas (Kristi Angus), is ordered to dissect Jason's body. Lowe, who is in serious debt, calls his financial backer Dieter Perez (Robert A. Silverman), of the \"Solaris\", who recognizes Jason's name and notes that Jason's body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector.\n\nWhile Stoney and Kinsa are having sex, Jason thaws out and attacks Adrienne, then freezes her face with liquid nitrogen before smashing her head to pieces on a counter. Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship. He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him to his death, to Kinsa's horror. Sergeant Brodski (Peter Mensah) leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason. Meanwhile, Jason enters a projected holographic game and attacks and kills Dallas by bashing his skull against the wall after breaking Azrael's back. He then tries to attack Crutch, but Brodski and his soldiers save him. Jason disappears; after Brodski splits up his team, Jason kills them one by one.\n\nLowe orders Pilot Lou (Boyd Banks) to dock in on \"Solaris\", a nearby space station. As he is talking with the \"Solaris\" engineer, he is hacked apart by Jason. With no pilot, the ship crashes through \"Solaris\", destroying it, and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the \"Solaris\". The crash damages one of the Grendel's pontoon sections. Jason breaks into the lab, reclaims his machete and decapitates Lowe.\n\nWith the ship badly damaged, the remaining survivors head for \"Grendel\"s shuttle, while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14. After finding Lou's remains, Crutch (Philip Williams) and Waylander prepare the shuttle. Rowan finds Brodski, but he is too heavy for her to carry, so she leaves to get help. Waylander leaves to help with him, while Crutch prepares the shuttle. Jason kills Crutch by electrocution. On board the shuttle, Kinsa hears of Crutch's death and has a panic attack. She attempts to escape alone and leave everyone else for dead by launching the shuttle but forgets to release the fuel line, causing it to crash into the ship's hull and explode, killing her. Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14, complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills. KM-14 cartwheels and fights Jason off and seemingly kills him, knocking him into a nanite-equipped medical station and blasting off his right arm, left leg, right rib cage, and, finally, part of his head. The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle.\n\nThe survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section. As they work, Jason is accidentally brought back to life by the damaged medical station, rebuilt as an even more powerful cyborg. Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off. As Tsunaron picks up her still-functioning head, Jason attacks them but is stopped by Waylander, who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape. Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle. He punches a hole through the hull, blowing out Janessa. A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go EVA to fix it.\n\nMeanwhile, a hard light holographic simulation of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason, along with two virtual teenagers to distract him, which works at first but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed. Brodski confronts Jason so that the rest can escape. As they leave, the pontoon explodes, propelling Jason at high speed towards the survivors; however, Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and maneuvers them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two, incinerating them. Tsunaron, Rowan, and KM-14 celebrate having escaped successfully, and Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her.\n\nOn Earth Two, a pair of teenagers beside a lake see what they believe is a falling star as Jason's charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake. The teenagers go to investigate.\n\n\nDevelopment of \"Jason X\" began in the late 1990s while \"Freddy vs. Jason\" was still in development hell. With \"Freddy vs. Jason\" not moving forward, Jim Isaac and Sean S. Cunningham decided that they wanted another \"Friday the 13th\" film made to retain audience interest in the character. The film was conceived by Todd Farmer, who plays \"Dallas\" in the film, and was the only pitch he gave to the studio for the movie, having suggested sending Jason into space as a means to advance the film series.\n\nThe film was filmed during the summer of 1999 in Toronto. The film score was composed and conducted by Harry Manfredini. It was released by Varèse Sarabande on May 14, 2002.\n\n\"Jason X\" was released in November 2001 in Spain, and on 26 April 2002 in Los Angeles and New York. A theatrical trailer was released on 9 November 2001.\n\nThe film made $13.1 million in the U.S. and $3.8 million internationally for a worldwide gross of $16.9 million, becoming one of the worst-performing films in the series, after \"\" and \"\", which made $14.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 20% based on 106 reviews and an average rating of 3.56/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Jason goes to the future, but the story is still stuck in the past\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 25 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the movie 0.5 stars out of 4, quoting one of the film's lines: \"This sucks on so many levels.\"\n\nHowever, the film was better received in the United Kingdom, gaining positive reviews from the country's two major film magazines, \"Total Film\" and \"Empire\". \"Empire\"s review by Kim Newman in particular praised \"Jason X\" as \"Wittily scripted, smartly directed and well-played by an unfamiliar cast, this is a real treat for all those who have suffered through the story so far.\"\n\nDespite the initially negative reception from critics, the film has recently seen a retrospective growth in popularity, particularly among younger fans of the series. Praise has been directed at the film's ability to poke fun at itself and the film series as a whole, as well as inventive death scenes; Adrienne's death in particular (head frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then shattered against a table) is often singled out as a highlight, and was even tested on an episode of \"MythBusters\" in 2009.\n\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on October 8, 2002. It was released on Blu-ray in 2013, with all of the films in the \"Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection\" set.\n\n\n"}

He was especially noted for his genre paintings of monks. He also repeatedly portrayed Falstaff.\n\nGrützner was born in 1846 into a noble family in Groß-Karlowitz near Neisse, Upper Silesia, Prussia (now Poland). His father was a prominent member of the church, and the local pastor often visited his parents' home. He recognized Eduard's talent and inclination for painting early on. The administrator of a ducal country house in the neighborhood got him paper, and eventually the pastor gained him entrance to the \"Gymnasium\" (a university preparatory school) of Neisse.\n\nIn 1864, the pastor brought Grützner to the private school of Hermann Dyck in Munich for art education, though his tenure at the Kunstgewerbeschule under Dyck was of short duration. In the first semester he transferred to the Classical Art class of Johann Georg Hiltensperger and Alexander Ströhuber, where the students learned about the aesthetic ideals of antiquity.\n\nIn 1865, Grützner joined the painting class of Hermann Anschütz at the Munich Academy. Meanwhile, he also sought advice and inspiration from Carl Theodor von Piloty; he was taken into Piloty's class in 1867. Piloty's class included aspiring artists from Hungary, Greece, Germany, Russia, and Poland. After three years under Piloty, Grützner left the academy.\n\nIn 1870, Grützner moved into his own studio in the garden house of Schwanthalerstraße 18 in Munich. He quickly began to produce many paintings, and he became a very successful artist. It was reported by artist and writer Friedrich Pecht in the journal \"Die Kunst für Alle\" (Art for All) in 1886: \"the painters Eduard Grützner and Ludwig Willroider were granted the title of 'professor' by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria\". In 1880, he was awarded the Order of Merit of St. Michael (Knight's Cross) first class. He was knighted in 1916.\n\nGrützner was an avid collector of art. Early on, he favored pieces from the German late Gothic and early Renaissance. In the last decade of his life, he turned from the late Middle Ages and collected art from the Far East. In his major compositions, however, he almost always included old pieces, mostly from his antique collection.\n\nIn 1874, Grützner married Barbara Link. Two years later, they had a daughter named Barbara. In 1884, after ten years of marriage, his first wife died. In 1888, he became engaged to Anna Grützner Wirthmann, the daughter of a Munich garrison commander, and a short time later their son Karl Eduard was born. This second marriage was less harmonious and eventually his wife, who was seventeen years younger, left him for a Viennese singer.\n\nIn his old age he sought solace in Chinese philosophy, and began to collect items from the far east and learn Japanese. Occasionally he included a Buddha figure or a Chinese vase in some of his paintings. He also painted a number of ascetic-looking cardinals, often with harsh and unsympathetic features. He died on April 2, 1925, in Munich.\n\nGrützner was, along with Carl Spitzweg and Franz von Defregger, one of Munich's leading genre painters in the second half of the 19th century. Grützner's paintings are best known for their combination of detailed academic rendering with humorous and anecdotal subject matter.\n\nGrützner was one of Hitler's favorite painters. Albert Speer quoted Hitler as saying that Grützner was \"greatly underrated... Believe me, this Grützner will someday be worth as much as a Rembrandt. Rembrandt himself couldn't have painted that better.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2269502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269502", "title": "PostSecret", "text": "PostSecret\n\nPostSecret is an ongoing community mail art project, created by Frank Warren in 2005, in which people mail their secrets anonymously on a homemade postcard. Selected secrets are then posted on the PostSecret website, or used for PostSecret's books or museum exhibits.\n\nThe concept of the project was that completely anonymous people decorate a postcard and portray a secret that they had never previously revealed. No restrictions are made on the content of the secret; only that it must be completely truthful and must never have been spoken before. Entries range from admissions of sexual misconduct and criminal activity to confessions of secret desires, embarrassing habits, hopes and dreams.\nPostSecret collected and displayed over 2,500 original pieces of art from people across the United States and around the world between its founding on January 1, 2005 and 2007.\n\nThe site, which started as an experiment on Blogger, was updated every Sunday with 10 new secrets, all of which share a relatively constant style, giving the artists who participate some guidelines on how their secrets should be represented. From June 24 to July 3, 2007, the \"Comments\" section of the site was enabled. While a comments feature is frequently present on blogs, it had been previously absent from the PostSecret site. Many visitors felt that the new section contradicted the purpose of the site, as evidenced in numerous comments criticizing a postcard in which the author claims to have fed bleach to her cat. In October 2007, the PostSecret Community was launched. Since its inception, more than 80,000 users have registered for the online discussion forum.\n\nAccording to Youth Trends' February 2008 \"Top Ten List Report\" PostSecret was the 10th most popular site among female students in the US, with 7% of those polled naming the site as their favorite.\n\nIn April 2008, Warren teamed up with 1-800-suicide to answer some of these anonymous cries for help through peer run crisis hotlines on college campuses.\n\nIn April 2011, it was announced that an app would be developed by Bonobo, and released for iPhone and Android later in the year. Launched for iPhone on 3 September 2011, it quickly reached the top-selling spot. Over 2 million secrets were shared over the next few months, but malicious entries became widespread and uncontrollable. The app was removed in December 2011.\n\nWarren hosts events at numerous colleges to speak about the many different secrets of today's society. An art exhibition also travels the country, showcasing many of the hundreds of thousands of secrets he has received. In his book, \"My Secret\", Warren talks about his experiences with encounters with people all around the world who were inspired by the postcards, and how it got many people addressing things that they would otherwise never discuss.\n\nSince its founding on 1 January 2005, the site has had new weekly Sunday Secrets with very few exceptions. On two occasions, Warren posted a personal video message rather than secrets. On Sunday, 12 August 2007, in lieu of posting secrets, Warren posted the link to a video he had uploaded to YouTube entitled \"New PostSecret Mini-Movie\", expressing his feelings about the project.\n\nOn Sunday, September 16, 2007, the traditional PostSecret blog was gone. In its place was a new blog belonging to someone named \"Nicole\". The real PostSecret had been suddenly and mistakenly shut down, as Blogger thought it was a \"spam blog\". The error was fixed and Warren's site was put back up with the secrets from September 9.\n\nOn October 11, 2009, Warren took a break, posting a video and apology saying that he was busy touring, and urging readers to buy the book \"PostSecret Confessions on Life, Death and God\".\n\nOn 24 February 2008, Warren posted multiple e-mail comments from viewers that attacked various secrets posted that week—notably one from a parent insulting a teacher, one from a call operator insulting a relative of a soldier, and one from a would-be mother insulting a woman desperate not to get pregnant. This revitalized previous discussions on whether or not commenting should be allowed at all on the secrets. While it was noted that sometimes such actions lead to others passing judgment on the posters without granting them the opportunity to defend themselves, no action was taken, and the blog continued as normal the next week.\n\nThe secrets are meant to be empowering both to the author and to those who read them. Frank Warren claims that the postcards are inspirational to those who read them, have healing powers for those who write them, give hope to people who identify with a stranger's secret, and create an anonymous community of acceptance.\n\nIn an article for \"USA Today\", Maria Puente wrote, \"Evan Imber-Black, a family therapist and author of \"The Secret Life of Families\", says telling secrets has no meaning except in the context of family relationships. We live in a time where people have the mistaken idea that you tell a secret to the multitudes on TV — and move on. But opening a secret is just the first step. (Posting on PostSecret) might offer some measure of relief, but I'm not sure how long it lasts. When a secret opens, it usually takes time and relational work to get a new equilibrium.\"\n\nThe PostSecret app was released for iOS devices on 3 September 2011. Included in over two million submissions were some indecent, threatening, and abusive ones. During the month of December, volunteer moderators were unable to keep up, despite working 24/7. Warren was contacted by users, Apple, law enforcement and the FBI.\n\nThe app was removed from the App Store on 28 December 2011. On 1 January 2012, a formal announcement on the PostSecret website said that the app would not be returning due to its inherent inability to solve the problem of abusive submissions.\n\nOn Saturday, 31 August 2013, the weekly update of Sunday Secrets contained as its first secret a Google map of a geographic area with the words, \"I said she dumped me, but, really, I dumped her (body),\" accompanied by a red arrow. The disturbing nature of this secret created an uproar in social media. Reddit users were able to pinpoint the location shown as Jackson Park in Chicago, and after making phone calls, the Chicago Police Department sent officers to explore the area. They found nothing, leading to speculation as to whether this secret was genuine. Homicide detectives investigated. On 3 September 2013, the supposed confession was \"determined to be not bona fide\" and a hoax, according to Chicago police.\n\nPostSecret Archive was a searchable database that allowed users to search all previous PostSecret posts by date or by keyword. It is no longer in operation. An archived version is available.\n\nArtwork from the site was blown up to poster size and used as the background in the 2005 All-American Rejects music video for \"Dirty Little Secret.\" The blown up poster-size PostSecrets, along with thousands of regular size PostSecrets, were then featured in an exhibition with the Washington Project for the Arts.\n\nIn the sixth annual Weblog Awards, the PostSecret website received five Bloggies in 2006: Best American Weblog, Best Topical Weblog, Best Community Weblog, Best New Weblog, and Weblog of the Year. In the seventh annual Weblog Awards, the PostSecret website received Weblog of the Year for 2007.\n\nIn an episode of \",\" titled \",\" the murder victim was linked to a website called \"SecretsU,\" where viewers mail in the deepest, darkest secret and turn it into art.\n\nIn the \"\" episode “”, the murder victim tried to post a photo with a hidden message to a website called “miafina” (Malagasy for ‘secret’) where users post personal confessions.\n\nPostSecret inspired another collaborative art project Snail Mail My Email, where volunteers handwrite strangers' emails and send physical letters to the intended recipients, free of charge.\n\nFrom August 3, 2015 to September 2017, an exhibit at the National Postal Museum features more than 500 postcards submitted to PostSecret.\n\nTo date Warren has published six books compiling submitted secrets, including some which were never posted on the website.\n\nWarren has stated that he includes a secret of his own in each of the PostSecret books. His \"secret\" is not anonymous like most; rather, Warren signs his. For example: \"Sometimes when we think we are keeping a secret, that secret is actually keeping us. -Frank\"\n\n\nThe 1973 book \"Variable Piece 4: Secrets\" by the conceptual artist Douglas Huebler (one of many works in his \"Variable Piece\" series) was a compilation of nearly 1800 secrets written by random people.\n\n\n"}

His ancestry is different in certain sources - in one source he is shown as a son of Yul Qutlugh b. El-Temür b. Anbarchi b. Mengu Timur and in Mirkhwand he was a son of Qutlugh b. Amir Timur b. Anbarchi b. Mengu Timur.\n\nHe was still a child when Jalayirid Hasan Buzurg raised him to the throne with regnal name Muhammad Khan in opposition to his 3rd cousin once removed Musa. In a battle that took place on July 26, 1336, Hasan Buzurg and Muhammad Khan defeated the forces of 'Ali Padshah and his puppet Ilkhan, Musa. Hasan Buzurg then installed his claimant in Tabriz. Jalal ad-Din Zakariyya (or Shams al-Din) and late Mahmudshah Inju's son Masudshah were appointed as his viziers while Hasan's supporters reaffirmed their positions. Chupanid Sorgan and his mother Sati Beg gained Karabakh, Hajji Taghay reaffirmed in Diyar Bakr, Hajji Tughanak acquired Baghdad, Musa's would be killer, Emir Qara Hasan granted overlordship over Oirat tribes. However Qara Hasan and Hajji Tughanak couldn't manage to subjugate them and were utterly defeated, latter being killed. Remaining Oirats regrouped under Governor of Khorasan, Shaikh Ali (son of Emir Ali Quschi) and supported Togha Temür for Ilkhanid throne. They were further aided by Ögrünch and Mahmud Esen Qutlugh and even occupied Soltaniyeh for a while. However they were eventually defeated by Jalayirid army, Ali Padshah's brother Muhammed beg and his wife Qutlugh Malik Khatun (daughter of Gaykhatu) were killed by Kurdish tribesmen, while Oirat leader Shaikh Ali was executed by Arghunshah (son of Emir Nawruz), who wanted Togha Temür to be his own puppet.Ögrünch and Mahmud Esen Qutlugh were too eliminated.\n\nOver the next few years, Hasan Buzurg and Muhammad strengthened their hold over western Persia, but the appearance of the Chupanid Hasan Kucek interrupted their plans. Hasan Kucek claimed a Turkish slave of his father's deputy was in fact his father Timurtash and arrived from Egypt. This news caused Chupanids to split off from Jalayirids and join Hasan Kucek. The two opposing sides then met in the Ala Tagh area near Van on July 16, 1338, with both Hasan Buzurg and Muhammad Khan suffering defeat. After Hasan Buzurg fled, Muhammad Khan was captured by the Chupanids and executed.\n"}

While not a formation of the Confederate States Army, the Missouri State Guard fought alongside Confederate troops and, at various times, served under Confederate officers.\n\nThe Missouri General Assembly passed the \"Military Bill\" on May 11, 1861, in direct response to the Camp Jackson Affair in St. Louis the previous day. The final version of the act approved on May 14 authorized the Governor of Missouri, Claiborne Fox Jackson, to disband the old Missouri Volunteer Militia and reform it as the Missouri State Guard to resist a feared invasion by the Union Army. It also outlawed or prohibited other militia organizations except those authorized by the Guard's district commanders. This was primarily aimed at preventing Unionist Missourians from organizing \"Home Guard\" companies in the areas outside the metropolitan St. Louis area. This prohibition included the predominantly unionist German United States Reserve Corps regiments mustered in St. Louis in excess of the Missouri requirement under the Federal Militia Act of 1792. The law did allow for formation of new local Home Guards under the auspices of the MSG, but these were limited to 14–17 and 45+ year olds. It also specified that the language of all spoken commands was to be English, a specification intended to exclude ethnic Germans, who were predominantly Unionist in their political orientation. \nThe act divided the state into nine Military Districts based on the Federal Congressional Districts and made men ages 18 to 45 years of age eligible for MSG service unless exempted due to occupation, office or other reasons. While the act termed each district a \"division\", they were organized along brigade lines. The actual forces of a district consisted of all the regiments, not of brigades of these regiments. Each district's division was to be commanded by a brigadier general who was a resident of the district, and elected by the commissioned officers of the district. An act was passed on May 15 for the appointment of a major general to act as field commander; the first to be commissioned Major General was Sterling Price, the popular former governor and one of the most influential men in Missouri.\n\nRecruits for the Missouri State Guard began to quickly assemble in Jefferson City in mid-May. However, after an agreement, the Price–Harney Truce on May 20 between Price and the Federal department commander William S. Harney, the movement of Guardsmen to the state capitol was halted. The State Guard continued to be mobilized in their home districts. On May 30, Harney was relieved and Nathaniel Lyon took command of the department. On June 11, a meeting to resolve some disagreements resulted in the collapse of the truce. Price and Jackson fled St. Louis for Jefferson City. The next day Governor Jackson called for 50,000 volunteers to defend Missouri from the Union army; thousands of additional men answered the proclamation and enlisted in their respective districts/divisions.\n\nThe embryonic Missouri State Guard suffered a serious initial setback in a skirmish at Boonville on June 17 and began a retreat toward extreme southwestern Missouri. Two days later the Guard's path was cleared when a local MSG infantry and cavalry battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Walter S. O'Kane decisively defeated and captured the Benton County Home Guard at Cole Camp. Another victory on July 5 at the Battle of Carthage bought time for Price to begin training and organizing his raw recruits, many of whom had reported for military duty carrying only farm implements or antiquated hunting weapons. MSG organization and training was conducted at Cowskin Prairie, a former livestock auction site in southwest Missouri. A key figure in efforts to impose order on the embryonic organization was Adjutant General Lewis Henry Little, a native of Maryland and career Army officer.\n\nPrice, along with Confederate regulars and members of the Arkansas State Troops, defeated a smaller Union force under Nathaniel Lyon at Wilson's Creek on August 10, killing Lyon and driving back his army. Price, with 10,000 men, defeated a 600-man battalion of Kansas volunteer cavalry led by Senator James Lane at Big Dry Wood Creek on September 1–2, and then besieged and captured 3,600 Federal troops in the First Battle of Lexington (Battle of the Hemp Bales) in mid-month. As Frémont's Union army finally advanced toward Springfield, the Guard withdrew. A bold dash by Major Charles Zagonyi's mounted vanguard routed local MSG troops waiting in ambush on October 25, 1861, at the First Battle of Springfield. Fremont's offensive was subsequently recalled before engaging the main southern force when Fremont was relieved from command by order of President Lincoln.\n\nShortly afterwards, a session of exiled elements of the Missouri legislature convened in the southwest Missouri town of Neosho and claimed to have passed an Ordinance of Secession on October 30, with the Governor-in-Exile Jackson signing on October 31, 1861. While the vote was not endorsed by a statewide plebiscite, the Confederate Congress officially admitted Missouri at the 12th Confederate State on November 28, 1861.\n\nWhile in winter camp, Price began enrolling many of his men into the regular Confederate service. Two brigades of the MSG participated in the Battle of Pea Ridge (Elkhorn Tavern), where Brig. Gen. William Y. Slack, the former commander of the 4th Division, was mortally wounded.\n\nOn March 17, 1862, Price merged the Missouri State Guard into the Confederate Army of the West. Later, former Missouri State Guard troops would make up the core of Price's Army of Missouri, which participated in Price's Raid in 1864 in an attempt to capture the state. A small number of Guard units remained independent until the end of the war in 1865, seeing action in several engagements in the Trans-Mississippi Theater under generals Mosby M. Parsons and James S. Rains.\n\nThe foremost authorities on the Missouri State Guard recently estimated that at least 34,000 Missourians served in the Guard at one point or another during the war and that the actual number was probably near 40,000. The Guard's strength peaked at approximately 23,000 to 28,000 in September 1861 with approximately 5,000 in Southeast Missouri in M. Jeff Thompson's First Division operating independently of the main body surrounding Price near Lexington.\n\nThe Guard's divisions were based on congressional districts and composed of the following counties: (Commanders are listed in parentheses)\n\n\nMissouri did not have an official flag until Major-General Sterling Price, commander of the Missouri State Guard, ordered on June 5, 1861:\n\n"}

From there, he took robes from Superstars at ringside, played music at shows, worked as part of the ring crew, and continued to drive the company's trucks from town to town. After a while, he became a part-time referee, immediately taking advantage of several opportunities to fill in whenever he could. Shortly after, Doan's referee status changed to full-time.\n\nOne of the more notable incidents in Doan's career came when he participated in an angle on the January 22, 1996 episode of \"Raw\", where Vader made his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television debut following his debut at the Royal Rumble the prior night. Vader punched Doan twice in the face, picked him up and power-bombed him to the mat. When on-screen WWF president Gorilla Monsoon intervened, Monsoon picked Doan up off the mat and placed him in the corner. While Monsoon tended to the wounded official, Vader avalanched both of them, kayfabe knocking Doan into unconsciousness. He was out of action for several weeks, selling the injuries he received at the hands of Vader, but eventually reappeared at WrestleMania XII, refereeing another Vader match.\n\nDoan was out of action for about a month with legit stretched ligaments in his knee after Gigolo Jimmy Del Ray, one half of The Heavenly Bodies, accidentally clipped him during a tag match. Doan also suffered a concussion at the 1998 Royal Rumble when Phineas Godwinn was thrown over the top rope and inadvertently kicked him in the back of the head. The Legion of Doom performed a Doomsday Device on Doan at In Your House: Unforgiven 1998.\n\nDuring The Invasion, he bickered with Alliance referee Charles Robinson.\n\nDuring the 24/7 ruling of the WWE Hardcore Title where anyone could challenge the champion any time and anywhere, Doan attempted to beat Crash Holly in an impromptu match to win the belt, and went as far as to remove his referee's shirt and persuade fellow referee Jimmy Korderas to count the fall. His attempt, however, was unsuccessful.\n\nOn a July 2007 episode of \"Raw\", Doan took the microphone from Santino Marella and made a match between him and Umaga, who had just made his entrance during a promo being cut by Marella. Doan is also known for refereeing more diva matches than any other ref on \"Raw\".\n\nHe was taken off the road in mid-summer 2007 with a shoulder injury that required surgery. He returned to television on January 21, 2008, officiating a Divas match. He reinjured the shoulder a few months later and returned to officiate Victoria's last match against Michelle McCool on January 16, 2009 episode of \"SmackDown\".

The group was most notable for their debut album \"Enta da Stage\", and their affiliation with the Boot Camp Clik.\n\nBlack Moon (backronymed as Brothers who Lyrically Act and Combine Kickin Music Out On Nations) debuted in 1992, with the release of the single \"Who Got Da Props?\". The song became an underground phenomenon, and charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. With the help of DJ Chuck Chillout, the group landed a record deal with Nervous Records and released its debut album, \"Enta da Stage\", in late 1993. The album included \"Who Got Da Props?\" as well as the singles \"Son Get Wrec\", \"How Many MC's...\", \"Buck 'Em Down\", and another Hot 100 Hit, \"I Got Cha Opin (Remix)\". Enta da Stage went on to sell over 350,000 copies in the U.S. and is now regarded as an underground hip hop classic. Following the album's release, the group temporarily broke up.\n\nDuring the group's hiatus, DJ Evil Dee continued his production career with Da Beatminerz, and Buckshot headed out and formed his own group called the Boot Camp Clik, featuring fellow Brooklyn locals Smif-n-Wessun, Heltah Skeltah and O.G.C.. Following the releases of the debuts of Smif-n-Wessun (\"Dah Shinin'\"), Heltah Skeltah (\"Nocturnal\"), and O.G.C. (\"Da Storm\"), Black Moon reunited on Duck Down Records. In late 1996, Nervous Records released a Black Moon compilation album titled \"Diggin' In Dah Vaults\", which featured a number of remixes and b-side tracks. After the group's split with Nervous Records, Black Moon became entangled in a legal battle over the licensing rights of their group name, which lasted for a number of years. The case was finally settled in 1998, and the group was able to license its name through Nervous.\n\nIn 1999, the group released its long-awaited second album \"War Zone\". The album saw a change in the group's musical style, with a more mature Buckshot showing off a calmer, more serious lyrical delivery, and the noticeably more vocal 5 ft.making appearances with M.O.P (\"Annihilation\") and Heather B (\"For All Y'all\"), and also featured a new lo-fi production sound from Da Beatminerz. The album's singles \"Two Turntables & a Mike\" and \"This is What it Sounds Like (Worldwind)\" made small impact, and the group was not able to properly capitalize on its hype. Despite the somewhat disappointing sales, the album received good reviews. 1999 also saw the solo debut album from Buckshot, titled \"The BDI Thug\", which was seen as a major disappointment. The album was met with mediocre reviews and little sales. Black Moon was largely missing from the hip hop scene between 2000 and 2001.\n\nBlack Moon returned in 2003 for the release of its third album \"Total Eclipse\", which featured the underground hit \"Stay Real\" and \"Pressure is Tight\", as well as two music videos, shot for the singles \"Stay Real\" and \"This Goes Out to You\". The album, like the group's previous efforts, received good reviews, but it wasn't able to reach outside the underground hip hop audience. DJ Evil Dee continued production work with Da Beatminerz, and Buckshot continued to work with the Boot Camp Clik while 5 ft is working on a solo project. In 2005, Buckshot released a collaboration album with producer 9th Wonder titled \"Chemistry\". In 2006, DJ Evil Dee and his brother Mr. Walt released a mixtape titled \"Alter the Chemistry\", which paired Buckshot's vocals from the \"Chemistry\" album with classic Black Moon beats.\n\nIn 2007, 5 ft recorded the song \"BK All Day\" with Boot Camp Clik, for the BCC album of the same year, \"Casualties of War\". In 2008, Buckshot released with 9th Wonder their second collaboration album titled \"The Formula\".\n\n5 ft is working in his solo album debut. He was featured on General Steel's solo album of the Group Smif-n-Wessun on Duckdown records, \"Welcome To Bucktown\", on the song \"Made me do it\". 5 ft is featured on the new compilation CD called \"Moment of Clarity\", which was Released August 2009 on Coalmine Music, Inc., Produced by Grant Parks. His song is \"The God in You\". It was recently confirmed by the group in 2011 that it started recording its fourth album together called \"Dark Side of the Moon\" and to be fully produced again by Da Beatminerz, with possible new members to its production team.\n\n\n\n"}

Hailed as one of the most \"unjustly under loved jazz greats of the 1950s\" and the \"most accomplished modern jazz harpist,\" Ashby established the harp as an improvising jazz instrument, beyond earlier use as a novelty or background orchestral instrument, proving the harp could play bebop as adeptly as the instruments commonly associated with jazz, such as the saxophone or piano.\n\nAshby had to overcome many obstacles during the pursuit of her career. As an African American female musician in a male dominated industry, she was at a disadvantage. In a 1983 interview with W. Royal Stokes for his book \"Living the Jazz Life,\" she remarked of her career, \"It's been maybe a triple burden in that not a lot of women are becoming known as jazz players. There is also the connection with black women. The audiences I was trying to reach were not interested in the harp, period—classical or otherwise—and they were certainly not interested in seeing a black woman playing the harp.\" Ashby successfully navigated these disadvantages, and subsequently aided in the expansion of who was listening to harp music and what the harp was deemed capable of producing as an instrument.\n\nAshby's albums were of the jazz genre, but often moved into R&B, world music, and other styles, especially her 1970 album \"The Rubaiyat of Dorothy Ashby\", where she demonstrates her talents on another instrument, the Japanese koto, successfully integrating it into jazz.\n\nDorothy Thompson grew up around music in Detroit, where her father, guitarist Wiley Thompson, often brought home fellow jazz musicians. Even as a young girl, she would provide support and background to their music by playing the piano. She attended Cass Technical High School, where fellow students included such future musical talents and jazz greats as Donald Byrd, Gerald Wilson, and Kenny Burrell. While in high school she played a number of instruments (including the saxophone and string bass) before coming upon the harp.\n\nShe attended Wayne State University in Detroit, where she studied piano and music education. After she graduated, she began playing the piano in the jazz scene in Detroit, though by 1952 she had made the harp her main instrument. At first her fellow jazz musicians were resistant to the idea of adding the harp, which they perceived as an instrument of classical music and somewhat ethereal in sound in jazz performances. So Ashby overcame their initial resistance and built support for the harp as a jazz instrument by organizing free shows and playing at dances and weddings with her trio. She recorded with Jimmy Cobb, Ed Thigpen, Richard Davis, Frank Wess and others in the late 1950s and early 1960s. During the 1960s, she also had her own radio show in Detroit where she would occasionally perform live shows with her husband, and talk.\n\nAshby partially contributed to the spread of unstereotypical music education in Detroit, Michigan during 1967. Robert H. Klotman, a divisional director of music education was inspired by her and Cass Technical Highschool’s harp and vocal ensemble, placing 10 Troubadour harps in 5 inner city schools.\n\nAshby's trio, including her husband, John Ashby, on drums, regularly toured the country, recording albums for several record labels. She played with Louis Armstrong and Woody Herman, among others. In 1962, Ashby won \"Down Beat\" magazine's critics' and readers' awards for best jazz performers. Extending her range of interests and talents, she also worked with her husband in a theater company, the Ashby Players, which her husband founded in Detroit, and for which Dorothy often wrote the scores. In the 1960s Dorothy Ashby, together with her husband, formed a theatrical group to produce plays that would be relevant to the African-American community of Detroit. This production group went by several names depending on the theater production.\n\nThey created a series of theatrical musical plays that Dorothy and John Ashby produced together as this theatrical company, the Ashby Players of Detroit. In the case of most of the plays, John Ashby wrote the scripts and Dorothy Ashby wrote the scores. Dorothy Ashby also played harp and piano on the soundtracks to all of her plays. She starred in the production of the play \"3–6–9\" herself. Most of the music that she wrote for these plays is available only on a handful of the reel to reel tapes that Dorothy Ashby recorded herself. Only a couple of the many songs she created for her plays later appeared on LPs that she released. Later in her career, she would make recordings and perform at concerts primarily to raise money for the Ashby Players theatrical productions.\n\nThe theatrical production group \"The Ashby Players\" not only produced black theater in Detroit and Canada but provided early theatrical and acting opportunities for black actors. Ernie Hudson (of \"Ghostbusters\" 1 actor, credited as Earnest L. Hudson) was a featured actor in the Artists Productions version of the play \"3–6–9\". In the late 1960s, the Ashbys gave up touring and settled in California, where Dorothy broke into the studio recording system as a harpist through the help of the soul singer Bill Withers, who recommended her to Stevie Wonder. As a result, she was called upon for a number of studio sessions playing for more pop-oriented acts.\n\nHer first full jazz LP, The Jazz Harpist, was recorded for Savoy in 1957, with Frank Wess on flute, Eddie Jones and Wendell Marshall on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. The album was a mix of standards, such as “Thou Swell” and “Stella by Starlight”, and Ms. Ashby’s originals. It was critically well received, but the record buying public ignored it. Her next album Hip Harp, (1958) on Prestige, was one her best, with Wess, Dave Brubeck’s bassist Gene Wright and Art Taylor on drums. In all Dorothy led ten sessions between 1957 and 1970 Atlantic, Cadet and many other labels.She was fearless in her musical choices as she played not just bop, but soul, Brazilian, African, Middle Eastern and like her contemporary (and other great jazz harpist) Alice Coltrane, free jazz. Ms. Ashby pioneered the use of the Japanese koto in jazz on her 1970 album The Rubaiyat of Dorothy Ashby, which was somewhat maligned in its time, but has become appreciated as an iconoclastic marriage of soul, world music and free jazz.\n\nAshby died from cancer on April 13, 1986, in Santa Monica, California. Her recordings have proven influential in various genres. The High Llamas recorded a song entitled \"Dorothy Ashby\" on their 2007 album \"Can Cladders\". Hip-hop artists have sampled her work often, including Jurassic 5, on their album \"Feedback\", as well as Andre Nickatina on his song \"Jungle\". Bonobo included the track \"Essence of Sapphire\" on his mix album \"\".\n\n\nWith Bill Withers\nWith Bobbi Humphrey\nWith Minnie Riperton\nWith Wade Marcus\nWith Stanley Turrentine\nWith Stevie Wonder\nWith Sonny Criss\nWith Gene Harris\nWith Freddie Hubbard\nWith Billy Preston\nWith Bobby Womack\nWith Osamu Kitajima\n\n\n"}

It lies at the edge of the city centre, northeast of Birmingham New Street station.\n\nGosta Green is the home of the Aston University campus. The campus is also adjacent to the Aston Science Park.\n\nThere are two pubs – the \"Gosta Green\" on Great Lister Street, and \"The Sacks of Potatoes\" near Aston Street. The \"Gosta Green\" pub was originally called the \"Pot of Beer\". During the 1980s and early 1990s, it was a venue for indie music. Bands who performed at the pub include Pop Will Eat Itself and Blur. It later became a Scream pub; part of the Firkin chain, known as the \"Faculty and Firkin\" in the late 1990s. The Pub has recently been changed (2015) from being a Scream pub to the Common Room brand owned by Stonegate. It is called 'Gosta Green' with a more student orientated set-up with a good range of craft beers and ales and has established itself as being the most popular pub on the campus.\n\nHistorically Gosta Green ('Gosty Green') was part of the parish of Aston.\n\nProbably named from its holding by William de Gorsty in the early 14th century. It was known as Gostie Green by the mid 18th century, the name being a corruption of Gorsty to gorse (i.e. gorse bushes, locally called 'goss', which were common nearby).\n\nThe Green was actually two greens by the mid 18th century; Lower Gorsty Green being the larger, encircled by a road.\n\nIt was the location of Bishop Ryder Memorial Church from 1838 to 1960.\n\nMethodist preacher John Wesley was roughly handled while preaching on Gosta Green. In 1840, the Chartists Lovett and Collins, directly on their release from prison, gave speeches to 30,000 people on Gosta Green.\n\nThe Gosta Green Gun Quarter was visited by Queen Victoria in 1858, when it was described as: \"\"the centre of the locality in which the gun-trade carried on\"\", and the local gun-makers guild spent around £6,000 on street decorations.\n\nDuring the 19th century, until the late 1880s, Gosta Green was the location of a regular market. The surrounding streets were filled with back-to-back houses, small workshops, and a dozen pubs. Only a few pubs now remain to remind visitors of its Victorian past.\n\nEccles Motor Transport Ltd., a pioneer in the production of automobile pulled caravans, established its Gosta Green factory in 1919.\n\nGosta Green's Birmingham Arts Lab was formerly the Centre for the Arts as which it had been an important centre for theatre and music in the late 1970s having been established for Aston University by Theatre Organiser Nick Arnold, Music Organiser Tony Pither and Technical Manager Cliff Dix during that decade in the former Delica Cinema (later the BBC Midland television studios before the opening of Pebble Mill in 1971). Following the Lab take over the building became The Triangle Cinema, then the frontage became a Waterstones bookshop. The building has subsequently become the home of the European Bio-Energy Research Institute (EBRI), part of Aston University.\n\n"}

It is about the overall story of an architectural work, often revealed through art. \n\nNot all stories surrounding an architectural work incorporate a level of myth. These stories can also be well hidden to the casual viewer and are often built into the conceptual design of the architectural statement.\n\nBefore 600 BC worship was done in the open, but when the Greeks began to represent their Gods by large statues, it was necessary to provide a building for this purpose. This led to the development of temples.\n\nThe ancient Greek temples were often enhanced with mythological decorations from the columns to the roof. The architectural functions of the temple mainly concentrated on the cella with the cult statue. The architectural elaboration served to stress the dignity of the cella.\n\n\n\n"}

Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure. Rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation. Tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that, together with the eyewall and the eye, constitute a hurricane or tropical storm. The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.\n\nRainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes. Rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due to the formation of a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself. Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain or snow. Behind extratropical cyclones, rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. If the atmosphere is cold enough, these rainbands can yield heavy snow.\n\nRainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature. In an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind shear, narrow, convective rainbands known as squall lines generally in the cyclone's warm sector, ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones. Wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts, which tend to have more stratiform, and less convective, precipitation. Within the cold sector north to northwest of a cyclone center, in colder cyclones, small scale, or mesoscale, bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclone's comma head precipitation pattern with a width of to . These bands in the comma head are associated with areas of frontogensis, or zones of strengthening temperature contrast. Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm Great Lakes can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands which bring significant localized snowfall.\n\nRainbands exist in the periphery of tropical cyclones, which point towards the cyclone's center of low pressure. Rainbands within tropical cyclones require ample moisture and a low level pool of cooler air. Bands located to from a cyclone's center migrate outward. They are capable of producing heavy rains and squalls of wind, as well as tornadoes, particularly in the storm's right-front quadrant.\n\nSome rainbands move closer to the center, forming a secondary, or outer, eyewall within intense hurricanes. Spiral rainbands are such a basic structure to a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins, use of the satellite-based Dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds. Within this method, the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used to assign a maximum sustained wind and a central pressure. Central pressure values for their centers of low pressure derived from this technique are approximate.\n\nDifferent programs have been studying these rainbands, including the Hurricane Rainband and Intensity Change Experiment.\n\nConvective rainbands can form parallel to terrain on its windward side, due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud's formation. Their spacing is normally to apart. When bands of precipitation near frontal zones approach steep topography, a low-level barrier jet stream forms parallel to and just prior to the mountain ridge, which slows down the frontal rainband just prior to the mountain barrier. If enough moisture is present, sea breeze and land breeze fronts can form convective rainbands. Sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to mask the location of an approaching cold front by evening. The edge of ocean currents can lead to the development of thunderstorm bands due to heat differential at this interface. Downwind of islands, bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges. Offshore California, this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.\n\n"}

It is a matter of categorical discussion whether Eusebius divides his books into three groups of \"homologoumena\" (\"accepted\"), \"antilegomena\", and 'heretical'; or four, by adding a \"notha\" (\"spurious\") group. The \"antilegomena\" or \"disputed writings\" were widely read in the Early Church and included the Epistle of James, the Epistle of Jude, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, the Book of Revelation, the Gospel of the Hebrews, the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Apocalypse of Peter, the Acts of Paul, the Shepherd of Hermas, the Epistle of Barnabas and the Didache. The term \"disputed\" should therefore not be misunderstood to mean \"false\" or \"heretical\". There was disagreement in the Early Church on whether or not the respective texts deserved canonical status.\n\nThe first major church historian, Eusebius, who wrote his Church History c. AD 325, applied the Greek term \"antilegomena\" to the disputed writings of the Early Church:\nThe Epistle to the Hebrews had earlier been listed:\nCodex Sinaiticus, a 4th-century text and possibly one of the Fifty Bibles of Constantine, includes the Shepherd of Hermas and the Epistle of Barnabas. The original Peshitta (NT portion is c. 5th century) excluded 2 and 3 John, 2 Peter, Jude, and Revelation. Some modern editions, such as the \"Lee Peshitta\" of 1823, include them.\n\nDuring the Reformation, Luther brought up the issue of the antilegomena among the Church Fathers, and none of the New Testament books of the Canon of Trent was rejected from Luther's canon. The terminology remains in use today. Since he questioned Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation, these books are sometimes termed \"Luther's Antilegomena\". Current Lutheran usage expands this to also include 2 Peter, 2 John, and 3 John.\n\nF. C. Baur used the term in his classification of the Pauline Epistles, classing Romans, 1–2 Corinthians and Galatians as homologoumena; Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1–2 Thessalonians and Philemon as antilegomena; and the Pastoral Epistles as \"\"notha\"\" (spurious writings).\n\nThe term is sometimes applied also to certain books in the Hebrew Bible.\n\n\n\n"}

From 1915 to 1931, the Hagerstown Hubs played in the Class-D Blue Ridge League, which featured teams from the towns surrounding the Blue Ridge Mountains - including Hagerstown, Frederick, Martinsburg, Chambersburg, and Waynesboro. The Hubs played their games in Willow Lane Park, where Bester Elementary School is now located. The league featured several greats from the early years of baseball, such as Robert Moses \"Lefty\" Grove and Lewis \"Hack\" Wilson. Willie Mays played his first professional game at Hagerstown's Municipal Stadium on June 24, 1950. On that historic day, the Trenton Giants played against the Hagerstown Braves of the Class-B Interstate League.\n\nOn the underside of the first-base stands is the Hagerstown Suns Hall of Fame. For each member, there is a commemorative plaque.\n\n\nThe right field wall at Municipal Stadium honors five individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides professional baseball, Municipal Stadium has hosted numerous other events.\n\n\nBesides those dates listed above, there were other important dates at Municipal Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005 a movement arose to rename an adjacent street to honor Willie Mays, who played his first game at the park as a minor league rookie. The proposal, however, was shot down due to protests by various American war veterans groups who wanted to keep the original road name of Memorial Boulevard.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his 22-year tenure in WWE from 1987 to 2009.\n\nKorderas began working as a professional wrestling referee in 1985 at Maple Leaf Gardens. At first, he was hired as a driver by his friend Elio Zarlenga. At the time, Zarlenga was second in command only to Jack Tunney, and suggested making Korderas a referee. His first match was between Special Delivery Jones and Red Demon.\n\nIt was previously said that Korderas was legitimately knocked unconscious by Jimmy Hart at WrestleMania IV after Hart had accidentally hit him with his trademark megaphone. Koderas later said that this wasn't the case and that this particular version of the story is an urban legend. Rather, Korderas had knocked himself out as a result of landing awkwardly onto the canvas.\n\nOn May 23, 1999, Korderas was the referee at Over the Edge for the match between \"Blue Blazer\" Owen Hart and The Godfather. He was in the ring when Hart fell 75 feet from a harness tethered above the ring and died. According to reports, Hart yelled to Korderas to move because Hart did not want to land on Korderas, but Hart's foot still made contact Korderas' shoulder.\n\nDuring a kayfabe strike by the WWF referees in late 1999, Korderas was the only regular referee who did not join the strike, which led to him being attacked by the striking refs at Unforgiven in 1999.\n\nAt Rebellion in 2002, in a \"Kiss my Ass Match\" between Rikishi and Albert, Korderas forced Albert to kiss Rikishi's buttocks while Albert was trying to escape from the ring.\n\nOn November 4, 2004, episode of \"SmackDown!\", taped in St. Louis, Missouri, during an unscripted segment of \"Tough Enough\", Kurt Angle, a former amateur wrestler and 1996 Olympic gold medalist, challenged the finalists through a squat thrust competition. Chris Nawrocki won the competition, and the prize Nawrocki won was a match against Angle. Angle quickly took Nawrocki down, legitimately breaking his ribs, then made him submit with a \"neck crank\". After Angle defeated Nawrocki, Angle challenged the other finalists to a legitimate (shoot) wrestling match. Daniel Puder, an American professional mixed martial artist, accepted Angle's challenge. Angle and Puder wrestled for position, with Angle taking Puder down, however, in the process, Puder locked Angle in a \"kimura lock\". With Puder on his back and Angle's arm locked in the \"kimura\", Angle attempted a pin, one of two referees in the ring, Korderas, thought quickly and counted three to end the match, despite the fact that Puder's shoulders weren't fully down on the mat, bridging up at two. Puder later claimed he would have snapped Angle's arm, thus making Angle submit on national television, if Korderas had not ended the match. Dave Meltzer and Dave Scherer gave these following comments:\n\nKorderas played a minor part in what was JBL's last appearance as a wrestler on \"SmackDown!\". Originally giving JBL the win on the May 26, 2006 edition as JBL was taking the World Heavyweight Championship belt, Korderas spotted Rey Mysterio's foot on the bottom rope and restarted the match. Mysterio won after JBL threw Mysterio into Korderas, who was retying a turnbuckle pad that he had caught JBL untying, knocking Korderas out. He came to in time to see Mysterio pin JBL after an exchange of illegal objects and moves, thus ending JBL's Smackdown career. Earlier that night, Korderas had also been assigned to the JBL vs. Bobby Lashley match for the WWE United States Championship, which Lashley won. JBL, in his on-screen role as color commentator had bashed Korderas for being Canadian and claimed that he was screwed out of the Championship by Korderas.\n\nIn 2006, the WWE pulled Korderas off the road briefly due to health issues, but he returned to work shortly thereafter. In November 2008, referees, and thus Korderas, were made no longer exclusive to particular WWE television shows, or brands. On January 9, 2009, Korderas was released from WWE.\n\nOn May 12, 2012, Jim Korderas refereed a match at Ring of Honor's Internet Pay-Per View entitled Border Wars. Jim was heralded by fans chanting \"Thank you, Jimmy\" when he entered the ring.\n\nAfter leaving WWE, Korderas began spending more time with his wife and family, as well as taking classes in broadcasting.\n\nAfter meeting Arda Ocal, then of Sportsnet 360, Ocal brought him on as an analyst on \"Right After Wrestling\" on SIRIUS Radio, and also secured him a spot on the Aftermath Television Program, which Korderas is still a part of today.\n\nKorderas published a book on his life and career, called \"The Three Count - my life in stripes as a WWE referee\" The foreword was written by Adam Copeland (Edge) and was released on April 1, 2013 by ECW Press.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2269611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269611", "title": "Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV 10", "text": "Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV 10\n\nIn 1724 Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, , as part of his second cantata cycle. Taken from Martin Luther's German translation of the Magnificat canticle (\"Meine Seele erhebt den Herren\"), the title translates as \"My soul magnifies the Lord\". Also known as Bach's \"German Magnificat\", the work follows his chorale cantata format.\n\nBach composed \"Meine Seel erhebt den Herren\" for the Feast of the Visitation (2 July), which commemorates Mary's visit to Elizabeth as narrated in the Gospel of Luke, 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative the words of the Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's translation of the biblical text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, translated from the Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV 10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition as he had done with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.\n\nBy early July 1724 Bach was more than a month into his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. BWV 10 is the fifth of 40 chorale cantatas he started that year. The outer movements of the cantata are set for mixed choir and an orchestra consisting of trumpet, two oboes, strings and continuo. Luther's translation of Luke 1:46–48 is the text of the first movement. The canticle's doxology is the text of the last movement. The five middle movements are a succession of arias and recitatives, with, between the fourth and sixth movement, a duet for alto and tenor. Soprano and bass each have one aria, and the two recitatives are sung by the tenor. The text of the arias and recitatives is paraphrased and expanded from Luke 1:49–53 and 55. The text of the duet is Luther's translation of Luke 1:54. The melody associated with Luther's German Magnificat appears in movements 1, 5 and 7.\n\nThe music of two of the cantata's movements was published in the 18th century: an organ transcription of the duet was published around 1748 as one of the \"Schübler Chorales\", and the closing chorale was included in C. P. E. Bach's 1780s collection of his father's four-part chorales. The entire cantata was published in the first volume of the 19th-century first complete edition of Bach's works. In 20th- and 21st-century concert and recording practice the cantata is often combined with other German-language cantatas, but also several times with settings of the Latin Magnificat, by Bach and other composers.\nLate May 1723 Bach took office as Thomaskantor (Kantor at St. Thomas) and director musices (music director) in Leipzig. He remained in that office until his death in 1750. From the first Sunday after Trinity in 1723, that year falling on 30 May, to Trinity Sunday of the next year he presented a series of church cantatas known as his first cantata cycle. The cantatas of that cycle were often based on music he had composed before his Leipzig period. From the first Sunday after Trinity in 1724, that year falling on 11 June, he started his second cantata cycle with forty chorale cantatas composed to new librettos. Each of these librettos was based on the text of a known chorale, usually a Lutheran hymn, the tune of which was adopted by Bach in his setting.\n\nThe first weeks of the post Trinitatem (after Trinity) season included the Feast of John the Baptist (24 June) and the Feast of the Visitation (2 July). In Bach's time Protestant Leipzig observed three Marian feasts requiring . In the context of the liturgical year Visitation was the third of such occasions, after Purification, falling in the period of the Sundays after Epiphany, and Annunciation, falling around Easter. Several traditions regarding these Marian feasts, such as the selection of readings for the church services, were continued from the period before Leipzig had adopted Lutheranism. Cantatas with a text in the native language had, since the early 18th century, become the dominant genre of figural music in Reformed German regions. Practices rooted in older traditions included the occasional performance of a Latin Magnificat on occasions such as Marian Feasts or Christmas.\n\n\"Meine Seel erhebt den Herren\", BWV 10, for Visitation, is the fifth chorale cantata Bach presented in 1724. Its text is based on Luther's German translation of the Magnificat. The singing tune associated with that version of the Magnificat, a German variant of the tonus peregrinus, appears in Bach's composition.\n\nThe prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Book of Isaiah, the prophecy of the Messiah (), and from the Gospel of Luke the narration of Mary's visit to Elizabeth, which includes her song of praise, the Magnificat (). This gospel reading is a biblical episode that is often represented in art, especially in music where it has become a traditional part of Vesper services. In Bach's time, the German Magnificat was regularly sung in Leipzig in vespers in a four-part setting of the ninth psalm tone (tonus peregrinus) by Johann Hermann Schein. Different from the other chorale cantatas of the cycle, the base for text and music is not a chorale, but the German Magnificat. It is a canticle, a biblical song in prose concluded by the traditional doxology. The text is based on Luther's translation of the biblical song to German in the Luther Bible, and on the doxology.\n\nIn the format of the chorale cantata cycle, an unknown librettist retained some parts of Luther's wording, while he paraphrased other passages for recitatives and arias. He used the original verses 46–48 for the first movement, verse 54 for the fifth movement, and the doxology for the seventh movement. He paraphrased verse 49 for the second movement, verses 50–51 for the third, verses 52–53 for the fourth, and verse 55 for the sixth movement, the latter expanded by a reference to the birth of Jesus.\nBach's music is based on the traditional ninth psalm tone which was familiar to the Leipzig congregation.\n\nOne of Bach's predecessors as director musices of the Neukirche in Leipzig was Melchior Hoffmann. Around 1707 he composed a German Magnificat based on Luther's German translation of the Magnificat. The portfolio of performance parts of this composition was updated until well into Bach's time in Leipzig. The work, known as Kleines Magnificat (Little Magnificat), was for some time attributed to Bach, but later listed as spurious in the BWV catalogue (BWV Anh. 21 / Anh. III 168‑>). BWV 189, a Visitation cantata on a libretto that paraphrases the text of the Magnificat canticle, also seems rather to have been composed by Hoffmann than by Bach, to whom this work used to be attributed.\n\nJohann Kuhnau, Bach's predecessor as Thomaskantor, composed a Latin Magnificat in two versions: one version with only the Latin text of the Magnificat for Marian feasts such as Visitation, and another version expanded with four German and Latin \"laudes\" relating to Christmas. When Bach presented his Latin Magnificat in 1723 (E-flat major version, BWV 243a) it had the same expandable format: without \"laudes\" for Visitation, and with four \"laudes\", on the same text as Kuhnau's, for Christmas. Another composition presented by Bach at that year's feast of the Visitation was \"Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben\", BWV 147, an expanded version of an Advent cantata composed before his Leipzig period (BWV 147a).\n\nA repeat performance of BWV 243a may have accompanied the first performance of BWV 10 on 2 July 1724. The libretto of the cantata performed in Leipzig at the feast of the Visitation of 1725 survives. Maria Aurora von Königsmarck is the possible author of this Magnificat paraphrase. Around a decade before the libretto was reprinted in Leipzig it had already been set by Reinhard Keiser and Johann Mattheson. It is not known whether Bach set the libretto, neither which setting of the libretto was used for the 1725 Visitation feast in Leipzig. A year later Bach performed \"Der Herr wird ein Neues im Lande\", JLB 13, a Visitation cantata by his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach. Picander's libretto for the Visitation cantata of 1728 may have been set as part of Bach's fourth cantata cycle: the libretto, surviving without music, starts with a \"dictum\" quoted from Luther's German translation of Luke 1:46–47.\n\nAround 1733 Bach transposed his Latin Magnificat to D major (BWV 243). Besides transposing, he also applied a few modifications: for instance in the movement that has Luke 1:54 as text he replaced the trumpet as performer of the cantus firmus by two oboes. Around a decade later Bach prepared two Latin Magnificats by other composers for performance (BWV 1082, BWV Anh. 30). Probably around the same time Bach performed BWV 10 again.\n\nSeveral characteristics of the Magnificats and Visitation cantatas of the first half of the 18th century are combined in Bach's German Magnificat: it uses text of Luther's translation of the Magnificat, like BWV Anh. 21 and Picander's 1728 libretto, and it uses text paraphrased from the Magnificat like BWV 189 and the 1725 Visitation cantata. Like the Meiningen libretto used for JLB 13 the cantata not only starts with a \"dictum\" but also has a second \"dictum\", directly quoted from Luther's translation of the New Testament, near the middle of the cantata (movement 4, \"Meine Seele erhebt den Herrn\", in Johann Ludwig's cantata, and movement 5, \"Er denket der Barmherzigkeit\" in BWV 10). This characteristic sets BWV 10 apart from Bach's other chorale cantatas, which as a rule contained quotes from Lutheran hymns, not from biblical prose.\n\nSome musical similarities between BWV 10 and Bach's Latin Magnificat have been described. Philipp Spitta sees a similar musical treatment at the end of the respective movements based on the Luke 1:51 text, which are the central \"Fecit potentiam\" movement of the Latin Magnificat and the third \"Des Höchsten Güt und Treu\" movement of BWV 10. The movements with respectively the German and Latin text of Luke 1:54 present the tonus peregrinus melody associated with Luther's German Magnificat as a cantus firmus played by wind instruments. The \"Suscepit Israel\" movement of the BWV 243a version of the Latin Magnificat has that cantus firmus performed by a trumpet. In the later BWV 243 version of the same movement the trumpet has been replaced by two oboes. In the corresponding movement of BWV 10 (\"Er denket der Barmherzigkeit\") the cantus firmus is performed by the trumpet and the two oboes. Masaaki Suzuki assumes that this should be interpreted as trumpet for the original 1724 version, replaced by two oboes in the 1740s revival version, the same modification that occurred to the related movement of the Latin Magnificat.\n\nBach followed a specific structure for most of the cantatas of his chorale cantata cycle, especially the 40 he presented consecutively from the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724 to Palm Sunday of 1725. In this chorale cantata format he retained the original text and melody of the chorale on which the cantata was based in the outer stanzas, typically treating the first as a chorale fantasia and the last as a four-part chorale setting, while the inner stanzas were reworded by a librettist as the basis for recitatives and arias, usually with music independent of the chorale tune.\n\n19th-century Bach scholars were largely unaware of the composition history of the chorale cantatas, and how Bach conceived the cycle of these cantatas:\n\nDetails about the history, organisation and coherence of the cycle were only elucidated in the second half of the 20th century, by scholars such as Alfred Dürr. According to this research the chronology of the first six chorale cantatas Bach presented in 1724 is updated as follows (K numbers of the first edition of the chronological Zwang catalogue are given between brackets):\n\nThe strong coherence between the first four cantatas of this series, as belonging to the same set, has been described for instance by Christoph Wolff. The first of these cantatas begins with a chorale fantasia in the form of a French overture, with the soprano singing the cantus firmus of the chorale. The opening movement of the cantata for the next Sunday is in motet style, with the cantus firmus sung by the alto. For the next occasion, St. John's Day, Bach wrote a cantata with an opening movement in the style of an Italian violin concerto, in which the cantus firmus was given to the tenor. The next day followed a cantata opening with a movement in vocal and instrumental counterpoint with the cantus firmus sung by the bass. Conductor John Eliot Gardiner writes about these first four cantatas of the chorale cantata cycle: \"Together they make a fascinating and contrasted portfolio of choral[e] fantasia openings.\"\n\nLibretto publications in Bach's Leipzig more than once grouped the first four cantatas after Trinity, or started a new publication with the cantata for the fifth occasion after Trinity. In 1724 that fifth occasion was Visitation, for which Bach composed . It is not a typical second cycle chorale cantata in the sense that it was based on a prose text (lacking the metre of a hymn text) and a Gregorian chant melody (lacking a musical metre). Further, the unmodified canticle text and chant melody not only appeared in the outer movements but also in one of the middle movements (the duet, No. 5). The text of the final movement was a generic doxology which could be appended to any religious chant, while other chorale cantatas commonly ended with a text that only appeared in the hymn from which it was quoted. BWV 125, Bach's chorale cantata for Purification based on the \"Canticle of Simeon\" (Luke 2:29–32), does not have these exceptions to the second cycle format: it is based on Luther's versified paraphrase of the canticle and its metrical hymn melody. Nonetheless Dürr writes about BWV 10 (here rendered in Richard D. P. Jones' translation): \"if ever a work deserved the description 'chorale cantata' it is this, for it is based on a genuine (Gregorian) chorale melody\".\n\nIn 1724 the feast of the Visitation fell on the fourth Sunday after Trinity, thus the next cantata Bach composed was a chorale cantata for the fifth Sunday after Trinity. Bach did apparently not compose a cantata for the sixt Sunday after Trinity in 1724 while absent from Leipzig. Bach's second year in Leipzig passed without composing a chorale cantata specifically for the fourth Sunday after Trinity. He composed one for this occasion in 1732, \"Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ\", BWV 177, one of the later additions to the chorale cantata cycle. Also for Trinity VI Bach composed a chorale cantata at a later date (BWV 9).\n\nBach structured the cantata in seven movements. The first and last are set for choir, and are based on the chant melody. They frame recitatives, arias and a duet of the soloists. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: trumpet (Tr), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The trumpet is only used to highlight the cantus firmus and may have been a tromba da tirarsi, a slide trumpet. The title page of the original parts reads: \"Festo Visitationis | Mariae | Meine Seel erhebt den Herren. | â | 4. Voc: | Tromba. | 2. Hautbois. | 2. Violini. | Viola | e | Continuo | di Sigl. | J. S. Bach.\" The duration of the piece has been stated as 23 minutes.\n\nIn the following table of the movements, the column text holds first the verse from the biblical Magnificat, adding \"Luther\" for the movements kept in his translation, and \"anon.\" if the unknown librettist paraphrased and expanded his translation. The scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book by Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.\n\nThe opening chorale fantasia is marked vivace (lively). Bach begins the movement with an instrumental introduction that is unrelated to the psalm tone. It is a trio of the violins and the continuo, with the oboes doubling the violin, and the viola filling the harmony. The main motif stands for joy and is set in \"rhythmical propulsion\".\n\nThe chorus enters after 12 measures with \"\" (My soul magnifies the Lord). The cantus firmus is in the soprano, doubled by a trumpet, whereas the lower voices add free polyphony on motifs from the introduction. Bach treats the second verse similarly, but with the third verse, \"\" (for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid), the cantus firmus appears in the alto. Certain words, such as \"freuet\" (rejoice) and \"selig preisen\" (call me blessed) are adorned with melismas. The movement is concluded by a vocal setting without cantus firmus embedded in the music of the introduction, framing the movement.\n\nThe soprano aria \"\" (Lord, you who are strong and mighty) is a concerto of the voice and the oboes, accompanied by the strings. It is the first soprano aria in the chorale cantata cycle.\n\nThe recitative \"\" (The goodness and love of the Highest) ends on an arioso. Spitta compares the end of this movement with the end of the 7th movement of Bach's Latin Magnificat: textually both movements treat the same part of the Magnificat (the end of Luke 1:51), and, although the other movement is set for five-part chorus and tutti orchestra, he considers the closure of this recitative of the \"German Magnificat\" cantata \"equally picturesque\".\n\nThe following aria \"\" (The mighty God casts from their thrones) is set for bass and continuo. A descending bass line in the continuo over two octaves illustrates the fall, which the voice also suggests in descending phrases. The second aspect of the text, the exaltation of the humble, is shown by rising figures, and the final emptiness (\"bloß und leer\", bare and empty) by pauses.\n\nIn the fifth movement, \"\" (He remembers his mercy), the text returns to the original German Magnificat, and the music to the psalm tone. It is played by oboes and trumpet as the cantus firmus, while alto and tenor sing in imitation. Klaus Hofmann interprets the bass line of \"emphatic downward semitone intervals\" as \"sighs of divine mercy\". \n\nThe recitative for tenor, \"\" (What God, in times past, to our forefathers), referring to God's promise, begins secco. \n\nIn the final movement, the two verses of the doxology are set on the psalm tone for four parts, with all instruments playing colla parte. Wind instruments and violin I join the soprano part. The setting is mostly in homophony, but turns to polyphony for the final \"von Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit\" (for ever and ever).\n\nBoth Bach's autograph score and the parts used for the cantata's first performance survive. The score, previously owned by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Philipp Spitta and Paul Wittgenstein, among others, came in the possession of the Library of Congress in 1948. The original parts remained in Leipzig, where they were entrusted to the Bach Archive in the 20th century.\n\nBWV 648 is a chorale prelude for organ transcribed from the cantata's fifth movement. It was first published around 1748 as fourth of the \"Schübler Chorales\". The music of the cantata's closing movement is included in the Dietel collection, a 1730s manuscript containing 149 of Bach's four-part chorales. C. P. E. Bach published the same music of BWV 10 as No. 357 in Part IV of his 1780s collected edition of four-part chorales by his father.\n\nThe entire cantata was published in 1851 in the first volume of the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA), edited by Moritz Hauptmann. The New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) published the score in 1995, edited by Uwe Wolf, with the critical commentary published the same year.\n\nThe cantata was also published with a singable English version of the text:\n\nKarl Richter programmed BWV 10 along Bruckner's 150th Psalm at his first concert in Ottobeuren in 1957. In the 1960s, Paul Steinitz's and Fritz Werner's recordings of the cantata were released on LPs which also featured another German cantata by Bach. On Richter's 1978 LP release BWV 10 was also combined with other German Bach cantatas. Karl Münchinger's 1968 recording and Hans-Joachim Rotzsch's 1978 recording of BWV 10 were issued on LPs which included their respective performances of Bach's Latin Magnificat. Also Michael Gielen's concert at the 1991 combined Bach's German and Latin Magnificat. Teldec's, Hänssler's, Koopman's, Brilliant Classics' and Suzuki's complete Bach cantata recordings include a recording of BWV 10.\n\nRoland Büchner's 2000 recording, with the Regensburger Domspatzen, combined Bach's \"German Magnificat\" with the 1723 Christmas version of his Latin Magnificat (BWV 243a). Gardiner's Bach Cantata Pilgrimage featured BWV 10 in a concert recorded in 2000. Ton Koopman's concert at the 2003 Leipzig Bach Festival combined BWV 10 with the Christmas versions of Bach's and Kuhnau's Magnificat, thus allowing to compare similar works of two consecutive Thomaskantors. Sigiswald Kuijken recorded BWV 10 for his \"Cantatas for the Complete Liturgical Year\" series in 2007. The same year, a concert at the Indiana University combined Bach's \"Meine Seel erhebt den Herren\" cantata with a 2005 Magnificat by Sven-David Sandström.\n\nGustav Leonhardt, Pieter-Jan Leusink and Ton Koopman used period instruments for their complete Bach cantata recordings. Also Musica Florea, the orchestra on Büchner's recording, performs on historic instruments.\n\n\"By author or editor\"\n\n\"By title as issued\"\n\n"}

Proper witnessing is critical to the validation of the marriage, also acting as a protection against suspicions of adulterous relationships.\n\nIn Shia Islam, witnesses to a marriage are deemed necessary, but in case are not available then the two parties may conduct the nikah between themselves. It is also believed that temporary marriage, or Nikah Mut'ah (a type of contract which had more relaxed requirements) was prohibited in Sunni Islam, the necessity of witnessing was introduced by Sunni caliphs, specifically Umar, to ensure that no couples engaged in secret union.\n\nMarriages are usually not held in mosques, (depending on the country and culture of both where the marriage happens and the parties involved) because typically men and women are separated during the ceremony and reception. Islam doesn't authorize any official clergy, so any Muslim who understands the Islamic tradition can be the official for the wedding. However, if a Muslim wedding is held in a mosque, then a marriage officiant, known as \"qadi\", \"qazi\" or \"madhun\" (), may preside over the wedding.\n\nAmong the stipulations that can be included in the marriage contract include giving up, or demanding, certain responsibilities. The contract may also be used to regulate the couple's physical relationship, if needed.\n\nThe marriage contract can also specify where the couple will live, whether or not the first wife will allow the husband to take a second wife without her consent. The wife has the right to initiate divorce, it is called khula. She either gives back the dowry (mahr) or does not, depending on the reason for divorce. The man has the right to divorce. The marriage contract somewhat resembles the marriage settlements once negotiated for upper-class Western brides, but can extend to non-financial matters usually ignored by marriage settlements or pre-nuptial agreements.\n\nOne important purpose of the contract is to make sexual intercourse legal. This is supported by various Hadiths and quotations:\n\nSahih Bukhari, Book 62, #81:\n\nAl-Mughni (by Ibn Qudaamah), Kitab al Nikah:\n\nCited in (Al Aqad,2014) the common problem of translation of marriage contracts is due to the varieties of word synonyms in the legal Arabic system which have no equivalence in the English system in terms of marriage contracts, such as; مهزٍ, شبكه, صداق. الخ , Mahr, Shabkah, Sadaq- (dowry), whereas, all of these examples attributed and affected by the culture and tradition of the Arabic language.\n\n\n"}

On the ground floor, he built and opened a bar known as The Exchange. He \"became successful and opened other bars in the 1970s.\"\n\nIn May 1983, Kimsey was brought in as a manufacturing consultant for Control Video Corporation by his West Point friend Frank Caufield, an investor in the company. CVC was founded by William von Meister to market an online service called GameLine for the Atari 2600 video game console. Von Meister had previously hired Steve Case as a marketing consultant on the recommendation of Case's brother, investment banker Dan Case. Von Meister quietly left the company in early 1985. \n\nShortly thereafter, Control Video was reorganized as Quantum Computer Services, with co-founders Kimsey as CEO, Marc Seriff as CTO, and Steve Case.

The company was founded in 1842 by Samuel R. Mott and Jamotia Hunter of Newport News, Virginia and Bouckville, New York, who made apple cider and vinegar. Mott products were exhibited at Philadelphia's Centennial Exposition in 1876 and Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. In 1900, the company merged with the W. B. Duffy Cider Company to become Duffy-Mott. In 1933, the company introduced prune juice.\n\nEventually, the company was acquired by American Brands (formerly American Tobacco) and became a division of that conglomerate. In 1982, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Duffy-Mott Company. In early 2006, all of Mott's beverage brands (Hawaiian Punch, IBC Root Beer, Mr & Mrs T Bloody Mary mix, Orangina, and Yoo-hoo) were folded into Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages. Mott's continues to operate as a separate unit of Keurig Dr Pepper (recently demerged from Cadbury Schweppes plc). In 2008, Marcia Cross was a spokeswoman of Mott's.\n\n\n\n\nOn May 23, 2010, 305 workers at the Mott's plant in Williamson, New York, represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union Local 220 (RWDSU), voted to strike after Mott's parent company, Keurig Dr Pepper (DPS)-- despite healthy profits, an increase in market share and stock price—proposed serious cuts to employee benefits.\n\nThe proposal from the company included a $1.50 per hour wage cut for all employees, a pension elimination for future employees and a pension freeze for current employees, a 20 percent decrease in employer contributions to the 401(k) and increased employee contributions toward health care premiums and co-pays. DPS came under criticism for proposing cuts to worker pay at a time when not only was the local economy in turmoil, but the top three executives at DPS had doubled their pay between 2007 and 2009.\n\nState Attorney General Andrew Cuomo wrote to Mott's on June 25, 2010, urging the company to return to the bargaining table and come to a \"fair and equitable solution\".\n\nThe labor dispute has been a source of anxiety among many in the region, particularly apple growers. In a letter to Fang Li, President and CEO of Keurig Dr Pepper, US Senator Chuck Schumer expressed concern that \"with unemployment in the Rochester area nearly 10 percent, the ongoing labor shortage is not only harming the 305 workers of the RWDSU Local 200 who work in the facility, but can harm the entire Wayne County economy due to the facility's centrality to the regional and state apple market.\"\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by the New York Apple Association, Inc., in a statement urging Mott's to continue negotiations:\n\nOn Monday, September 13, 2010, the strike ended after Mott's workers voted to approve the company's most recent proposal. The new agreement included a wage freeze, but not the pay cuts the company had demanded. The contract also preserved pensions for existing workers.\n\n"}

Watt Powell also was known for the CSX railroad line hard by the south wall of the stadium; some fans were known to watch games from there rather than pay to enter the stadium. Watt Powell Park was bounded by MacCorkle Avenue on the front (North) side, 35th Street on the east, and South Park Road on the west. On the south side of the park, a ridge of hills formed a natural boundary.\n\nThe stadium earned a reputation as a pitchers' park due to the lack of power hitting over its lifespan. Part of this can be attributed to its dimensions; the field was 340 feet from home plate to the wall in left field, 330 feet in right, and a daunting 420 feet in deep center field. The outfield walls were also 12 feet high the whole distance around, higher than walls seen elsewhere in baseball. The center field wall included a 90-degree, inward facing angle, reminiscent of the old Griffith Stadium in Washington, DC.\n\nWatt Powell Park closed in 2005 after the opening of Appalachian Power Park in Charleston's East End, near downtown. The Alley Cats moved to the new stadium and renamed themselves the West Virginia Power. The stadium was sold to the University of Charleston which then sold two thirds to the region's largest hospital, Charleston Area Medical Center, whose largest facility is a few blocks away. Demolition of the stadium began in late 2005 and in 2015 a new CAMC cancer clinic opened on the site.\n\n"}

While in college, she married Dr. Neil Holland, an internist, and they had two daughters, Kimberly and Courtney, before divorcing after 14 years of marriage. Grant's radio success occurred mainly in Southern California, where she had moved with her family in 1970.\n\nPrior to getting into broadcasting, Grant maintained a private practice, counseling former Vietnam veterans and later working with autistic children and people with schizophrenia. She first got started in radio as a guest expert on psychology on controversial Los Angeles talk show host Bill Ballance's \"Feminine Forum\", in 1972 on station KGBS, and then on KABC. Grant was so well-received that in 1975, she got her own call-in advice show on KABC radio. Almost immediately, she gained a sizeable following and received critical acclaim for her ability to handle the advice-giving genre, while being both informative and entertaining. Said \"Los Angeles Times\" media critic James Brown, \"Grant... is a soothing, reinforcing sounding board for people with problems.\" In fact, in a world of increasingly angry and confrontational talk hosts, Grant came to be known as \"the Doctor who tells it like it is, but in a nice way.\"\n\nBeginning in 1982, Grant and several other KABC personalities, were syndicated nationally via satellite, on the ABC Radio Network. This brought her show to a much wider audience on talk stations around the country. That year, it was reported that she was earning more than $100,000 a year, more than other radio psychologists. She was also considered more credible than some radio advice-givers because not only was she a licensed clinical psychologist but she was also a member of the American Psychological Association. From 1986 to 1988 her program was heard on the Mutual Broadcasting System, another national radio network.\n\nIn 1988 she re-married, to business executive John McCulloch Bell, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Bell Packaging Corporation. She also wrote a best-selling book called \"Being A Woman\", which she advised women to return to more traditional roles and embrace the idea of home and family. In 1989 she took a \"sabbatical\" from her radio program, which by then was originating at Los Angeles radio station KFI. During the following years she and her husband traveled extensively, and she also assisted him in his business ventures. In 1991, she and her husband relocated to Dallas, Texas, where she continued to write and do speaking engagements.

{"id": "2269688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269688", "title": "Dr. Bonham's Case", "text": "Dr. Bonham's Case\n\nThomas Bonham v College of Physicians, commonly known as Dr. Bonham's Case or simply Bonham's Case, was a case decided in 1610 by the Court of Common Pleas in England, under Sir Edward Coke, the court's Chief Justice, who explained why he thought that \"in many cases, the common law will control Acts of Parliament\". Coke's meaning has been disputed over the years. According to one interpretation, Coke intended the kind of judicial review that would later develop in the United States, but other scholars believe that Coke meant only to construe a statute, not to challenge parliamentary sovereignty. If Coke intended the former, he may have later changed his view. The statement by Coke is sometimes considered to be an \"obiter dictum\" (a statement made 'by the way'), rather than part of the \"ratio decidendi\" (rationale for the decision) of the case. \n\nWhatever Coke's meaning, after an initial period during which his decision enjoyed some support but no statutes were declared void, \"Bonham's Case\" was thrown aside, in favour of the growing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. In one of the most prominent early treatises supporting the doctrine, William Blackstone wrote that Parliament is the sovereign lawmaker, preventing the common law courts from throwing aside or reviewing statutes in the fashion that Coke had suggested. Parliamentary sovereignty is now the accepted judicial doctrine in the legal system of England and Wales.\n\n\"Bonham's Case\" was met with mixed reactions at the time, with King James I and his Lord Chancellor, Lord Ellesmere, both deeply unhappy with it. One of the reasons for Coke's dismissal from the Common Pleas in 1613 was suggested to be the case.\n\nAcademics in the 19th and the 20th centuries have been scarcely more favourable and called it \"a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially\" and simply an \"abortion\".\n\nIn the United States, Coke's decision met with a better reaction. During the legal and public campaigns against the writs of assistance and the 1765 Stamp Act, \"Bonham's Case\" was used as a justification for nullifying the legislation, but by 1772, Blackstone's views had gained acceptance.\n\nThe 1803 case \"Marbury v. Madison\", which in 1803 formed the basis for the exercise of judicial review in the United States, under Article III of the US Constitution, used the words \"void\" and \"repugnant\", but the usage of \"Marbury\" was somewhat different from that of Coke.\n\nAcademics have argued that the case forms the basis of judicial review in the United States; other academics disagree, one scholar calling that \"one of the most enduring myths of American constitutional law and theory, to say nothing of history\".\n\nThe College of Physicians (renamed in 1674 to the Royal College of Physicians) was an elite organisation. Created by royal charter in 1518, it was founded by six English academic doctors trained in English universities. It admitted only British men who had trained at a university and passed a three-part Latin exam in medical theory. Only 24 Fellows were allowed, and if an entrant came at a time when all 24 Fellowships were full, he would instead become a Candidate, the most senior Candidate being admitted to the first vacant Fellowship. An Act of Parliament confirming the royal charter also gave the college the ability to act as a court to judge other practitioners and to punish those who were acting badly or practising without a licence. A second Act, the College of Physicians Act 1553, amended the charter and gave the college the right to imprison indefinitely those judged. That \"flew in the face of the common law assumption that to practice medicine one needed only the consent of the patient\". Still, on 8 April 1602, John Popham, the Chief Justice, upheld the college's authority to imprison and fine: \"That no man, though never so learned a Phisition, or doctor may Practise in London, or within seaven myles, without the Colledge Lycense... That a free man of London, may lawfully be imprysoned by the Colledge\".\n\nThomas Bonham had been admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1581. Earning a bachelor's degree in 1584, he completed a master's by 1588 and studied for a medical doctorate at Cambridge, which was later granted by the University of Oxford. By 1602, he had completed his studies and moved to London, where he practised medicine and associated himself with the Barber-Surgeons' Company, campaigning for it to be allowed to authorise medical practitioners in a similar way to the College of Physicians. Apparently giving up after a failed petition to Parliament in 1605, Bonham petitioned to join the college on 6 December 1605 but was rejected and told to return after further study. Returning on 14 April 1606, he was again told he could not join and was fined £5 () and threatened with imprisonment for continuing to practise. Bonham still kept working as a doctor; on 3 October it was announced he was to be arrested and fined £10. Bonham again appeared before the college, now with a lawyer, on 7 November. He announced that he would continue to practise without seeking the college's permission, which he claimed had no power over graduates of Oxford or Cambridge. He was then imprisoned (some say at Fleet Prison, and some say at Newgate Prison) for contempt, but his lawyer had a writ of \"habeas corpus\", issued by the Court of Common Pleas, which freed him on 13 November.\n\nBonham's successful writ worried the college, whose previous success with Popham and \"keen cultivation\" of same as well as Lord Ellesmere and other Crown officials had left them assured that their jurisdiction would be maintained. As such, the college appealed directly to the Crown officers, and on 1 May 1607, it met with a committee of judges at Ellesmere's house. The committee were Ellesmere, Popham, Thomas Fleming, two judges from the Court of Common Pleas and two from the Court of King's Bench. The judges all agreed that \"for not well doeing useing or practicing the facultie or arte of physike or for disobedience or contempte donne and committed against anye ordynaunce made by the colledge... they may committ the offenders without bayle or mayneprise\". That success spurred the college to move against Bonham yet again, now by suing him in the King's Bench for £60 () for maintaining an illicit practice. In a counterattack, Bonham brought a suit in the Common Pleas, requesting £100 (£) damages, and alleging that they had trespassed against his person and wrongfully imprisoned him \"against the law and custom of this kingdom of England\".\n\nThe case was heard in the Court of Common Pleas by Warburton J, Daniel J, Foster J, Walmisley J and the Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke, with a decision finally reached in the winter of 1610. The college's lawyers had argued that the two Acts of Parliament and the royal charter \"intends, that none shall practise here but those who are most learned and expert, more than ordinary\". As such, the college was free to punish for both practising without a licence and for malpractice, with the 1553 Act giving them the authority to imprison those they judged. Bonham's lawyers replied by arguing that the Acts and charter were intended to prevent malpractice, not practising without a licence.\n\nMoreover, Bonham's study \"[in the texts at university] is practise [sic]\", and to become a doctor means to be considered capable of teaching: \"when a man brings with him the ensign of doctrine, there is no reason that he should be examined again, for then if thou will not allow of him, he shall not be allowed, though he is a learned and grave man, and it is not the intent of the King to make a monopoly of this practise\". As such, the Act \"doth not inhibit a doctor to practice [sic], but [only] punisheth him for ill using, exercising, and making [of physic]\". In other words, it covered malpractice, not illicit practice.\n\nWalmisley and Foster sided with the college, with Walmisley delivering the joint opinion. He said that since the statute clearly said \"no person\" could practise without the college's licence, only one verdict was acceptable, as the college had a valid licensing authority. The royal charter was to be interpreted as granting the college a duty on behalf of the King:\n\nAs such, in Walmisley's mind, the King had a duty to protect the health of his subjects and had delegated it to the college. In addition, Bonham had given \"an absurd and contemptuous answer\" when he claimed that he would not submit to the college, and \"it should be a vain law if it did not provide punishment for them that offend against that\". The King had delegated part of his prerogative powers to the college, for the purposes of punishment and imprisonment, and as such, it had the right to sit as a court.\n\nCoke delivered the majority opinion in favour of Bonham, with Daniel and Warburton agreeing. He undertook a closer reading of the college's charter and associated Acts and divided the relevant passage into two clauses. One gave the power to fine practitioners without licences. The latter specified that they could imprison a practitioner for \"not well doing, using or practicing physic\". He argued that they constituted separate powers and issues; the former dealt with authorisation to punish for illicit practise, and the other covered punishment for malpractice. Simply practising without a licence did not constitute malpractice. As such, the college did not have the power to imprison Bonham, who was accused of practising without a licence, not of practising dangerously.\n\nCoke also went further by arguing against the validity of the charter and its associated Acts, which gave the college the right to act as both as a judge and as a party to a case, which \"provided for an absurdity\":\n\nBecause of that and four other reasons given by Coke, the college was to stop trying to supervise medical practice, arbitrating and acting as a court. In support of his judgment, Coke cited not only \"Tregor's Case\" but also two anonymous cases with the academic names of \"Cessavit\" 42 and \"Annuitie\" 11, respectively.\n\nThe decision in \"Bonham's Case\" has been described by John Campbell (Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor in the 19th century) as \"a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially\". Philip Allott, in the \"Cambridge Law Journal\", simply called it an \"abortion\". Coke was later dismissed from his judicial posts, and Ellesmere immediately began making veiled criticisms, maintaining that it was unconscionable to allow the judges power to throw aside Acts of Parliament if they were repugnant or contrary to reason; however, he spoke \"not of impossibilities or direct repugnancies\". It was acceptable to overturn an Act if it was clearly and obviously repugnant but not otherwise.\n\nCoke has come under criticism for his examples to justify his decision. The first case that he gave, \"Tregor's Case\", was seriously misquoted. Coke stated, \"Herle said some statutes are made against law and right, which those who made them perceiving, would not put into execution\". In fact, there is no reference to \"law and right\" is found in the original text; Herle wrote that \"there are some statutes made which he himself who made them does not will to put into execution\", meaning only that some statutes are poorly drafted, and if they cannot be interpreted to work, Parliament would accept the courts not applying them. Theodore Plucknett wrote, \"Whoever reads the whole of Herle's remarks can see that he did not regard the statute then under discussion as falling within this category; on the contrary, he suggested a perfectly obvious and straightforward interpretation of it... Coke's first authority is far from convincing\".\n\nHis second authority, \"Cessavit\" 42, \"goes much further to support his thesis\" and concerns a situation in which William Bereford refused to apply an Act of Parliament because it would undermine several common law principles. However, Plucknett notes the distinction that in \"Cessavit\" 42, \"the statute is not held void; it is just ignored. To this fact Coke has really added an explanation and a theory of his own\".\n\nHis third example, \"Annuitie\" 11, was based on the Statute of Carlisle, which required all religious orders to have seals, placed in the custody of the prior and four of the \"worthiest brethren\" so that the Abbot could not use it without their knowledge. Any decisions made without the seal kept in that fashion were invalid. That clashed with church law and was incredibly difficult for small religious orders; as such, Sir Anthony Fitzherbert said that the statute was void, as it was \"impertinent\" or \"impossible\". However, Plucknett again casts doubt on the example's validity by stating that it \"would have looked strong... [but] is, in fact, of doubtful import\".\n\n\"Bonham's Case\" was deeply unpopular with the Crown; Coke was removed from the Common Pleas and sent to the King's Bench, in theory a more senior office but in practice a less rewarding one in 1613. In June 1616, he was suspended from office and ordered to \"correct\" his case reports. In October 1617, James I demanded an explanation from Coke of the reasoning behind \"Bonham's Case\". Coke claimed that \"the words of my report do not import any new opinion, but only a relation of such authorities of law, as had been adjudged and resolved in former times, and were cited in the argument of Bonham's case\". He refused to admit to any flaws with his writings, and his only corrections were minor errors and rearrangements of the language. If he meant the case as an endorsement of judicial review instead of Parliamentary sovereignty, withdrawal of that endorsement has been inferred from his later writings.\n\nThe decision has been variously interpreted. It can be construed as marking the supremacy of the common law over Parliament by judicial review or only as being another form of statutory interpretation. Noah Feldman suggested that the dispute over the two meanings has its origins in 1930s America, where frustration over judicial review of elements of the New Deal spilled into the academic world. James Kent, in his \"Commentaries on American Law\", argued that \"Bonham's Case\" and similar cases meant only that statutes should be given a \"reasonable construction\". Charles Gray, in the \"Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society\", argues that Coke, as a judge, never intended to advocate the judicial review of statutes. Bernard Bailyn wrote that \"Coke had not meant... 'that there were superior principles of right and justice which Acts of Parliament might not contravene'\" and also that by \"saying that courts might 'void' a legislative provision that violated the constitution he meant only that the courts were to construe statutes so as to bring them into conformity with recognized legal principles\".\n\nWilliam Searle Holdsworth agreed that it would be a mistake to view isolated statements by Coke in \"Bonham’s Case\" as endorsing limitations upon Parliament; Coke himself elsewhere acknowledged the power of Parliament as being \"so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons within any bounds\".\n\nRaoul Berger, in the \"University of Pennsylvania Law Review\", disagrees; the words of the statute were clear, and the only application that it could have was unjust. Statutory interpretation allows for the ignoring of unjust extraneous meanings, but what Coke did was nullify the statute as a whole, along with its main intention. John V. Orth, writing in the \"Constitutional Commentary\", concurs: \"If that were so, why did they not say so? Is it likely that the royal judges, confronting a case involving a statute that had necessarily passed both houses of parliament and received the royal assent, would lightly use the word 'void'?\"\n\nResearch by Samuel Thomas and Sir John Baker has led to a reassessment. During the early 17th century, non-common law courts were claiming an \"[i]mperial, almost legislative discretion over statutory interpretation, free from any supervisory jurisdiction of the common law courts\". Coke's decision can, therefore, be seen as him reminding such courts that their interpretations were subject to the law, not to individual discretion.\n\nDuring Coke's lifetime, he was judicially dominant, and his ideas were upheld by his successor as Chief Justice, Sir Henry Hobart, in \"Day v Savadge\" and \"Lord Sheffield v Ratcliffe\". After Coke's death, however, his jurisprudence \"naturally suffered an eclipse\", and its next appearance is in \"Godden v Hales\", in 1686, where the doctrine was twisted to argue that the Crown had the prerogative to dismiss government laws. Plucknett notes that \"the Revolution of 1688 marks the abandonment of the doctrine of \"Bonham's Case\"\", but in 1701, the common law judges cited Coke's decision with approval in \"City of London v Wood\", with John Holt concluding that Coke's statement is \"a very reasonable and true saying\". His position was to treat statutes in the same way as other documents for the purpose of judicial review and was followed for decades. Outside the judiciary, John Lilburne used \"Bonham's Case\" in his book \"The Legall Fundamentall Liberties of the People of England\" and then in his 1649 treason trial to justify his attack on the Rump Parliament.\n\nWith the growth of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, Coke's theory gradually died out; William Blackstone, in the first edition of his \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", wrote that \"if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power that can control it: and the examples alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them prove, that where the main object of a statute is unreasonable the judges are at liberty to reject it; for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government\". Parliamentary sovereignty is now upheld by the English judiciary as a \"central principle of British constitutionalism\" despite with some issues by membership in the European Union. The case's modern irrelevance is such that Philip Hamburger wrote in 2008, \"Bonham's Case scarcely deserves mention in a history of judicial duty, except for reasons that are now largely forgotten\".\n\nIn the Thirteen Colonies, there were instances of Coke's statement being interpreted to mean that the common law was superior to statute. For example, drawing on Coke's statement, James Otis, Jr., declared during the struggle over writs of assistance courts had to ignore Acts of Parliament \"against the constitution and against natural equity\", which had a significant impact on John Adams. When the 1765 Stamp Act was declared invalid by the Massachusetts Assembly, the rationale was that it was \"against Magna Charta and the natural rights of Englishmen, and therefore, according to the Lord Coke, null and void\". By 1772, Otis and others had reversed course by adopting Blackstone's position that judges cannot challenge Acts of Parliament. Even before then, \"Dr. Bonham's Case\" had rarely been used as a rallying cry in America; judicial review in America grew primarily from other political and intellectual sources.\n\nIn \"Marbury v. Madison\" (1803), the case that forms the basis for the exercise of judicial review in America, Chief Justice John Marshall stated that \"the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument\". Marshall specifically used the words \"void\" and \"repugnant\", which has been characterised as a deliberate reference to Coke, but Marshall's principle involved repugnancy to the written Constitution. instead of repugnancy to reason. In \"Hurtado v. California\" (1884), the US Supreme Court discussed \"Bonham's Case\" specifically by saying that it had not affected the omnipotence of parliament over the common law.\n\nEdward Samuel Corwin, writing in the \"Harvard Law Review\", praised the idea of a fundamental higher law of reason enforceable by judges and so endorsed \"the ratification which Coke's doctrine received in American constitutional law and theory\". Gary McDowell, writing in \"The Review of Politics\", called the case's influence \"one of the most enduring myths of American constitutional law and theory, to say nothing of history\". McDowell pointed out that it was never discussed during the 1786 Constitutional Convention. During the ratification conventions, despite Coke being mentioned, it was not during debates over the striking down of unconstitutional statutes. Also, other writings of Coke were brought up but never \"Bonham's Case\" itself.\nAn additional point of view is that the US Supreme Court has come \"full circle to the dictum in Bonham's Case\" by using the Due Process Clause to strike down what the Court deems \"unreasonable\" legislation.\n\n\n\n"}

Practitioners are known as \"mediums\" or \"spirit mediums\". There are different types of mediumship or spirit channelling, including seánce tables, trance, and ouija.\n\nMediumship gained popularity during the nineteenth century, when ouija boards were used by the upper classes as a source of entertainment. Investigations during this period revealed widespread fraud—with some practitioners employing techniques used by stage magicians—and the practice began to lose credibility. Fraud is still rife in the medium/psychic industry, with cases of deception and trickery being discovered to this day.\n\nScientific researchers have attempted to ascertain the validity of claims of mediumship. An experiment undertaken by the British Psychological Society led to the conclusion that the test subjects demonstrated no mediumistic ability.\n\nSeveral different variants of mediumship have been described; arguably the best-known forms involve a spirit purportedly taking control of a medium's voice and using it to relay a message, or where the medium simply \"hears\" the message and passes it on. Other forms involve materializations of the spirit or the presence of a voice, and telekinetic activity.\n\nThe practice is associated with several religious-belief systems such as Shamanism, Vodun, Spiritualism, Spiritism, Candomblé, Voodoo, Umbanda and some New Age groups.\n\nIn Spiritism and Spiritualism the medium has the role of an intermediary between the world of the living and the world of spirit. Mediums claim that they can listen to and relay messages from spirits, or that they can allow a spirit to control their body and speak through it directly or by using automatic writing or drawing.\n\nSpiritualists classify types of mediumship into two main categories: \"mental\" and \"physical\":\n\nDuring seances, mediums are said to go into trances, varying from light to deep, that permit spirits to control their minds.\n\nChanneling can be seen as the modern form of the old mediumship, where the \"channel\" (or channeller) purportedly receives messages from \"teaching-spirit\", an \"Ascended master\", from God, or from an angelic entity, but essentially through the filter of his own waking consciousness (or \"Higher Self\").\n\nAttempts to communicate with the dead and other living human beings, aka spirits, have been documented back to early human history. The story of the Witch of Endor (In the most recent edition of the NIV witch is rendered medium in the passage) tells of one who raised the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel to allow the Hebrew king Saul to question his former mentor about an upcoming battle, as related in the Books of Samuel in the Jewish Tanakh (the basis of the Old Testament).\n\nMediumship became quite popular in the 19th-century United States and the United Kingdom after the rise of Spiritualism as a religious movement. Modern Spiritualism is said to date from practices and lectures of the Fox sisters in New York State in 1848. The trance mediums Paschal Beverly Randolph and Emma Hardinge Britten were among the most celebrated lecturers and authors on the subject in the mid-19th century. Allan Kardec coined the term Spiritism around 1860. Kardec claimed that conversations with spirits by selected mediums were the basis of his \"The Spirits' Book\" and later, his five-book collection, \"Spiritist Codification\".\n\nSome scientists of the period who investigated Spiritualism also became converts. They included chemist Robert Hare, physicist William Crookes (1832–1919) and evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913). Nobel laureate Pierre Curie took a very serious scientific interest in the work of medium Eusapia Palladino. Other prominent adherents included journalist and pacifist William T. Stead (1849–1912) and physician and author Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930).\n\nAfter the exposure of the fraudulent use of stage magic tricks by physical mediums such as the Davenport Brothers and the Bangs Sisters, mediumship fell into disrepute. However, the religion and its beliefs continue in spite of this, with physical mediumship and seances falling out of practice and platform mediumship coming to the fore.\n\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s there were around one quarter of a million practising Spiritualists and some two thousand Spiritualist societies in the UK in addition to flourishing microcultures of platform mediumship and 'home circles'. Spiritualism continues to be practised, primarily through various denominational Spiritualist churches in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, over 340 Spiritualist churches and centres open their doors to the public and free demonstrations of mediumship are regularly performed.\n\nIn 1958, the English-born Spiritualist C. Dorreen Phillips wrote of her experiences with a medium at Camp Chesterfield, Indiana: \"In Rev. James Laughton's séances there are many Indians. They are very noisy and appear to have great power. [...] The little guides, or doorkeepers, are usually Indian boys and girls [who act] as messengers who help to locate the spirit friends who wish to speak with you.\"\n\nA spirit who uses a medium to manipulate psychic \"energy\" or \"energy systems.\"\n\nIn old-line Spiritualism, a portion of the services, generally toward the end, is given over to demonstrations of mediumship through contact with the spirits of the dead. A typical example of this way of describing a mediumistic church service is found in the 1958 autobiography of C. Dorreen Phillips. She writes of the worship services at the Spiritualist Camp Chesterfield in Chesterfield, Indiana: \"Services are held each afternoon, consisting of hymns, a lecture on philosophy, and demonstrations of mediumship.\"\n\nToday \"demonstration of mediumship\" is part of the church service at all churches affiliated with the National Spiritualist Association of Churches (NSAC) and the Spiritualists' National Union (SNU). Demonstration links to NSAC's Declaration of Principal #9. \"We affirm that the precepts of Prophecy and Healing are Divine attributes proven through Mediumship.\"\n\n\"Mental mediumship\" is communication of spirits with a medium by telepathy. The medium mentally \"hears\" (clairaudience), \"sees\" (clairvoyance), and/or feels (clairsentience) messages from spirits. Directly or with the help of a spirit guide, the medium passes the information on to the message's recipient(s). When a medium is doing a \"reading\" for a particular person, that person is known as the \"sitter\".\n\n\"Trance mediumship\" is often seen as a form of mental mediumship. Most trance mediums remain conscious during a communication period, wherein a spirit uses the medium's mind to communicate. The spirit or spirits using the medium's mind influences the mind with the thoughts being conveyed. The medium allows the ego to step aside for the message to be delivered. At the same time, one has awareness of the thoughts coming through and may even influence the message with one's own bias. Such a trance is not to be confused with sleepwalking, as the patterns are entirely different. Castillo (1995) states,\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, trance mediums were very popular. Spiritualism generally attracted female adherents, many who had strong interests in social justice. Many trance mediums delivered passionate speeches on abolitionism, temperance, and women's suffrage. Scholars have described Leonora Piper as one of the most famous trance mediums in the history of Spiritualism.\n\nIn the typical deep trance, the medium may not have clear recall of all the messages conveyed while in an altered state; such people generally work with an assistant. That person selectively wrote down or otherwise recorded the medium's words. Rarely did the assistant record the responding words of the sitter and other attendants. An example of this kind of relationship can be found in the early 20th century collaboration between the trance medium Mrs. Cecil M. Cook of the William T. Stead Memorial Center in Chicago (a religious body incorporated under the statutes of the State of Illinois) and the journalist Lloyd Kenyon Jones. The latter was a non-medium Spiritualist who transcribed Cook's messages in shorthand. He edited them for publication in book and pamphlet form.\n\nPhysical mediumship is defined as manipulation of energies and energy systems by spirits. This type of mediumship is claimed to involve perceptible manifestations, such as loud raps and noises, voices, materialized objects, apports, materialized spirit bodies, or body parts such as hands, legs and feet. The medium is used as a source of power for such spirit manifestations. By some accounts, this was achieved by using the energy or ectoplasm released by a medium, see spirit photography. The last physical medium to be tested by a committee from \"Scientific American\" was Mina Crandon in 1924.\n\nMost physical mediumship is presented in a darkened or dimly lit room. Most physical mediums make use of a traditional array of tools and appurtenances, including spirit trumpets, spirit cabinets, and levitation tables.\nDirect voice communication is the claim that spirits speak independently of the medium, who facilitates the phenomenon rather than produces it. The role of the medium is to make the connection between the physical and spirit worlds. Trumpets are often utilised to amplify the signal, and directed voice mediums are sometimes known as \"trumpet mediums\". This form of mediumship also permits the medium to participate in the discourse during séances, since the medium's voice is not required by the spirit to communicate. Leslie Flint was one of the best known exponents of this form of mediumship.\n\nIn the later half of the 20th century, Western mediumship developed in two different ways. One type involved clairaudience or sensitives who hear spirit, and then relay what they hear to their clients. The other incarnation of non-physical mediumship is a form of channeling in which the channeler goes into a trance, or \"leaves their body\", allowing a spirit entity to borrow their body, who then speaks through them. When in a trance the medium appears to come under the control of the spirit of a departed soul, sometimes entering into a cataleptic state, although modern channelers may not. Some channelers open the eyes when channeling, and remain able to walk and behave normally. The rhythm and the intonation of the voice may also change completely.\n\nA widely known channeler of this variety is J. Z. Knight, who claims to channel the spirit of Ramtha, a 30 thousand-year-old man. Others purport to channel spirits from \"future dimensions\", ascended masters, or, in the case of the trance mediums of the Brahma Kumaris, God. Other notable channels are Jane Roberts for Seth, Esther Hicks for Abraham, and Carla L. Rueckert for Ra.\n\nSenses used by mental mediums are sometimes defined differently from in other paranormal fields. A medium is said to have psychic abilities but not all psychics function as mediums. The term \"clairvoyance\", for instance, may include seeing spirit and visions instilled by the spirit world. The Parapsychological Association defines \"clairvoyance\" as information derived directly from an external physical source.\n\nSpiritualists believe that phenomena produced by mediums (both mental and physical mediumship) are the result of external spirit agencies. The psychical researcher Thomson Jay Hudson in \"The Law of Psychic Phenomena\" (1892) and Théodore Flournoy in his book \"Spiritism and Psychology\" (1911) wrote that all kinds of mediumship could be explained by suggestion and telepathy from the medium and that there was no evidence for the spirit hypothesis. The idea of mediumship being explained by telepathy was later merged into the \"super-ESP\" hypothesis of mediumship which is currently advocated by some parapsychologists.\n\nIn their book \"How to Think About Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age\", authors Theodore Schick and Lewis Vaughn have noted that the spiritualist and ESP hypothesis of mediumship \"has yielded no novel predictions, assumes unknown entities or forces, and conflicts with available scientific evidence.\"\n\nScientists who study anomalistic psychology consider mediumship to be the result of fraud and psychological factors. Research from psychology for over a hundred years suggests that where there is not fraud, mediumship and Spiritualist practices can be explained by hypnotism, magical thinking and suggestion. Trance mediumship, which according to Spiritualists is caused by discarnate spirits speaking through the medium, can be explained by dissociative identity disorder.\n\nIllusionists, such as Joseph Rinn have staged fake séances in which the sitters have claimed to have observed genuine supernatural phenomena. Albert Moll studied the psychology of séance sitters. According to (Wolffram, 2012) \"[Moll] argued that the hypnotic atmosphere of the darkened séance room and the suggestive effect of the experimenters' social and scientific prestige could be used to explain why seemingly rational people vouchsafed occult phenomena.\" The psychologists Leonard Zusne and Warren Jones in their book \"Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking\" (1989) wrote that spirits controls are the \"products of the medium's own psychological dynamics.\"\n\nA fraudulent medium may obtain information about their sitters by secretly eavesdropping on sitter's conversations or searching telephone directories, the internet and newspapers before the sittings. A technique called cold reading can also be used to obtain information from the sitter's behavior, clothing, posture, and jewellery.\n\nThe psychologist Richard Wiseman has written:\nCold reading also explains why psychics have consistently failed scientific tests of their powers. By isolating them from their clients, psychics are unable to pick up information from the way those clients dress or behave. By presenting all of the volunteers involved in the test with all of the readings, they are prevented from attributing meaning to their own reading, and therefore can't identify it from readings made for others. As a result, the type of highly successful hit rate that psychics enjoy on a daily basis comes crashing down and the truth emerges – their success depends on a fascinating application of psychology and not the existence of paranormal abilities.\n\nIn a series of experiments holding fake séances, (Wiseman \"et al\". 2003) paranormal believers and disbelievers were suggested by an actor that a table was levitating when, in fact, it remained stationary. After the seance, approximately one third of the participants incorrectly reported that the table had moved. The results showed a greater percentage of believers reporting that the table had moved. In another experiment the believers had also reported that a handbell had moved when it had remained stationary and expressed their belief that the fake séances contained genuine paranormal phenomena. The experiments strongly supported the notion that in the séance room, believers are more suggestible than disbelievers for suggestions that are consistent with their belief in paranormal phenomena.\n\nIn a 2019 television segment on \"Last Week Tonight\" featuring prominent purported mediums including Theresa Caputo, John Edward, Tyler Henry, and Sylvia Browne, John Oliver criticized the media for promoting mediums because this exposure convinces viewers that such powers are real, and so enable neighborhood mediums to prey on grieving families. Oliver said \"...when psychic abilities are presented as authentic, it emboldens a vast underworld of unscrupulous vultures, more than happy to make money by offering an open line to the afterlife, as well as many other bullshit services.\"\n\nFrom its earliest beginnings to contemporary times, mediumship practices have had many instances of fraud and trickery. Séances take place in darkness so the poor lighting conditions can become an easy opportunity for fraud. Physical mediumship that has been investigated by scientists has been discovered to be the result of deception and trickery. Ectoplasm, a supposed paranormal substance, was revealed to have been made from cheesecloth, butter, muslin, and cloth. Mediums would also stick cut-out faces from magazines and newspapers onto cloth or on other props and use plastic dolls in their séances to pretend to their audiences spirits were contacting them. Lewis Spence in his book \"An Encyclopaedia of Occultism\" (1960) wrote:\n\nA very large part is played by fraud in spiritualistic practices, both in the physical and psychical, or automatic, phenomena, but especially in the former. The frequency with which mediums have been convicted of fraud has, indeed, induced many people to abandon the study of psychical research, judging the whole bulk of the phenomena to be fraudulently produced.\nIn Britain, the Society for Psychical Research has investigated mediumship phenomena. Critical SPR investigations into purported mediums and the exposure of fake mediums has led to a number of resignations by Spiritualist members. On the subject of fraud in mediumship Paul Kurtz wrote:\n\nNo doubt a great importance in the paranormal field is the problem of fraud. The field of psychic research and spiritualism has been so notoriously full of charlatans, such as the Fox sisters and Eusapia Palladino–individuals who claim to have special power and gifts but who are actually conjurers who have hoodwinked scientists and the public as well–that we have to be especially cautious about claims made on their behalf.\n\nMagicians have a long history of exposing the fraudulent methods of mediumship. Early debunkers included Chung Ling Soo, Henry Evans and Julien Proskauer. Later magicians to reveal fraud were Joseph Dunninger, Harry Houdini and Joseph Rinn. Rose Mackenberg, a private investigator who worked with Houdini during the 1920s, was among the most prominent debunkers of psychic fraud during the mid-20th century.\n\nMany 19th century mediums were discovered to be engaged in fraud. While advocates of mediumship claim that their experiences are genuine, the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" article on spiritualism notes in reference to a case in the 19th century that \"...one by one, the Spiritualist mediums were discovered to be engaged in fraud, sometimes employing the techniques of stage magicians in their attempts to convince people of their clairvoyant powers.\" The article also notes that \"the exposure of widespread fraud within the spiritualist movement severely damaged its reputation and pushed it to the fringes of society in the United States.\"\n\nAt a séance in the house of the solicitor John Snaith Rymer in Ealing in July 1855, a sitter Frederick Merrifield observed that a \"spirit-hand\" was a false limb attached on the end of the medium Daniel Dunglas Home's arm. Merrifield also claimed to have observed Home use his foot in the séance room.\n\nThe poet Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth attended a séance on 23, July 1855 in Ealing with the Rymers. During the séance a spirit face materialized which Home claimed was the son of Browning who had died in infancy. Browning seized the \"materialization\" and discovered it to be the bare foot of Home. To make the deception worse, Browning had never lost a son in infancy. Browning's son Robert in a letter to \"The Times\", December 5, 1902 referred to the incident \"Home was detected in a vulgar fraud.\" The researchers Joseph McCabe and Trevor H. Hall exposed the \"levitation\" of Home as nothing more than his moving across a connecting ledge between two iron balconies.\n\nThe psychologist and psychical researcher Stanley LeFevre Krebs had exposed the Bangs Sisters as frauds. During a séance he employed a hidden mirror and caught them tampering with a letter in an envelope and writing a reply in it under the table which they would pretend a spirit had written. The British materialization medium Rosina Mary Showers was caught in many fraudulent séances throughout her career. In 1874 during a séance with Edward William Cox a sitter looked into the cabinet and seized the spirit, the headdress fell off and was revealed to be Showers.\n\nIn a series of experiments in London at the house of William Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used. Frank Herne a British medium who formed a partnership with the medium Charles Williams was repeatedly exposed in fraudulent materialization séances. In 1875, he was caught pretending to be a spirit during a séance in Liverpool and was found \"clothed in about two yards of stiffened muslin, wound round his head and hanging down as far as his thigh.\" Florence Cook had been \"trained in the arts of the séance\" by Herne and was repeatedly exposed as a fraudulent medium.\n\nThe medium Henry Slade was caught in fraud many times throughout his career. In a séance in 1876 in London Ray Lankester and Bryan Donkin snatched his slate before the \"spirit\" message was supposed to be written, and found the writing already there. Slade also played an accordion with one hand under the table and claimed spirits would play it. The magician Chung Ling Soo revealed how Slade had performed the trick.\nThe British medium Francis Ward Monck was investigated by psychical researchers and discovered to be a fraud. On November 3, 1876 during the séance a sitter demanded that Monck be searched. Monck ran from the room, locked himself in another room and escaped out of a window. A pair of stuffed gloves was found in his room, as well as cheesecloth, reaching rods and other fraudulent devices in his luggage. After a trial Monck was convicted for his fraudulent mediumship and was sentenced to three months in prison.\n\nIn 1876, William Eglinton was exposed as a fraud when the psychical researcher Thomas Colley seized a \"spirit\" materialization in his séance and cut off a portion of its cloak. It was discovered that the cut piece matched a cloth found in Eglinton's suitcase. Colley also pulled the beard off the materialization and it was revealed to be a fake, the same as another one found in the suitcase of Eglinton. In 1880 in a séance a spirit named \"Yohlande\" materialized, a sitter grabbed it and was revealed to be the medium Mme. d'Esperance herself.\n\nIn September 1878 the British medium Charles Williams and his fellow-medium at the time, A. Rita, were detected in trickery at Amsterdam. During the séance a materialized spirit was seized and found to be Rita and a bottle of phosphorus oil, muslin and a false beard were found amongst the two mediums. In 1882 C. E. Wood was exposed in a séance in Peterborough. Her Indian spirit control \"Pocka\" was found to be the medium on her knees, covered in muslin.\n\nIn 1880 the American stage mentalist Washington Irving Bishop published a book revealing how mediums would use secret codes as the trick for their clairvoyant readings. The Seybert Commission was a group of faculty at the University of Pennsylvania who in 1884–1887 exposed fraudulent mediums such as Pierre L. O. A. Keeler and Henry Slade. The Fox sisters confessed to fraud in 1888. Margaret Fox revealed that she and her sister had produced the \"spirit\" rappings by cracking their toe joints.\n\nIn 1891 at a public séance with twenty sitters the medium Cecil Husk was caught leaning over a table pretending to be a spirit by covering his face with phosphor material. The magician Will Goldston also exposed the fraud mediumship of Husk. In a séance Goldston attended a pale face materialization appeared in the room. Goldston wrote \"I saw at once that it was a gauze mask, and that the moustache attached to it was loose at one side through lack of gum. I pulled at the mask. It came away, revealing the face of Husk.\" The British materialization medium Annie Fairlamb Mellon was exposed as a fraud on October 12, 1894. During the séance a sitter seized the materialized spirit, and found it to be the Mellon on her knees with white muslin on her head and shoulders.\n\nThe magician Samri Baldwin exposed the tricks of the Davenport brothers in his book \"The Secrets of Mahatma Land Explained\" (1895). The medium Swami Laura Horos was convicted of fraud several times and was tried for rape and fraud in London in 1901. She was described by the magician Harry Houdini as \"one of the most extraordinary fake mediums and mystery swindlers the world has ever known\".\n\nIn the late 19th century, the fraudulent methods of spirit photographers such as David Duguid and Edward Wyllie were revealed by psychical researchers. Hereward Carrington documented various methods (with diagrams) how the medium would manipulate the plates before, during, and after the séance to produce spirit forms. The ectoplasm materializations of the French medium Eva Carrière were exposed as fraudulent. The fake ectoplasm of Carrière was made of cut-out paper faces from newspapers and magazines on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. Cut out faces that she used included Woodrow Wilson, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, French president Raymond Poincaré and the actress Mona Delza.\n\nThe séance trick of the Eddy Brothers was revealed by the magician Chung Ling Soo in 1898. The brothers utilized a fake hand made of lead, and with their hands free from control would play musical instruments and move objects in the séance room. The physiologist Ivor Lloyd Tuckett examined a case of spirit photography that W. T. Stead had claimed was genuine. Stead visited a photographer who had produced a photograph of him with deceased soldier known as \"Piet Botha\". Stead claimed that the photographer could not have come across any information about Piet Botha, however, Tuckett discovered that an article in 1899 had been published on Pietrus Botha in a weekly magazine with a portrait and personal details.\n\nThe trance medium Leonora Piper was investigated by psychical researchers and psychologists in the late 19th and early 20th century. In an experiment to test if Piper's \"spirit\" controls were purely fictitious the psychologist G. Stanley Hall invented a niece called Bessie Beals and asked Piper's 'control' to get in touch with it. Bessie appeared, answered questions and accepted Hall as her uncle. The psychologist Joseph Jastrow wrote that Piper pretended to be controlled by spirits and fell into simple and logical traps from her comments. Science writer Martin Gardner concluded Piper was a cold reader that would \"fish\" for information from her séance sitters. The physiologist Ivor Lloyd Tuckett who examined Piper's mediumship in detail wrote it could be explained by \"muscle-reading, fishing, guessing, hints obtained in the sitting, knowledge surreptitiously obtained, knowledge acquired in the interval between sittings and lastly, facts already within Mrs. Piper's knowledge.\"\n\nIn March 1902 in Berlin, police officers interrupted a séance of the German apport medium Frau Anna Rothe. Her hands were grabbed and she was wrestled to the ground. A female police assistant physically examined Rothe and discovered 157 flowers as well as oranges and lemons hidden in her petticoat. She was arrested and charged with fraud. Another apport medium Hilda Lewis known as the \"flower medium\" confessed to fraud.\n\nThe psychical researchers W. W. Baggally and Everard Feilding exposed the British materialization medium Christopher Chambers as a fraud in 1905. A false moustache was discovered in the séance room which he used to fabricate the spirit materializations. The British medium Charles Eldred was exposed as a fraud in 1906. Eldred would sit in a chair in a curtained off area in the room known as a \"séance cabinet\". Various spirit figures would emerge from the cabinet and move around the séance room, however, it was discovered that the chair had a secret compartment that contained beards, cloths, masks, and wigs that Eldred would dress up in to fake the spirits.\n\nThe spirit photographer William Hope tricked William Crookes with a fake spirit photograph of his wife in 1906. Oliver Lodge revealed there had been obvious signs of double exposure, the picture of Lady Crookes had been copied from a wedding anniversary photograph, however, Crookes was a convinced spiritualist and claimed it was genuine evidence for spirit photography.\n\nIn 1907, Hereward Carrington exposed the tricks of fraudulent mediums such as those used in slate-writing, table-turning, trumpet mediumship, materializations, sealed-letter reading and spirit photography. between 1908 and 1914 the Italian medium Francesco Carancini was investigated by psychical researchers and they discovered that he used phosphorus matches to produce \"spirit lights\" and with a freed hand would move objects in the séance room.\n\nIn 1908 at a hotel in Naples, the psychical researchers W. W. Baggally, Hereward Carrington and Everard Feilding attended a series of séances with Eusapia Palladino. In a report they claimed that genuine supernatural activity had occurred in the séances, this report became known as the Feilding report. In 1910, Feilding returned to Naples, but this time accompanied with the magician William S. Marriott. Unlike the 1908 sittings, Feilding and Marriott detected her cheating, just as she had done in America. Her deceptions were obvious. Palladino evaded control and was caught moving objects with her foot, shaking the curtain with her hands, moving the cabinet table with her elbow and touching the séance sitters. Milbourne Christopher wrote regarding the exposure \"when one knows how a feat can be done and what to look for, only the most skillful performer can maintain the illusion in the face of such informed scrutiny.\"\nIn 1910 at a séance in Grenoble, France the apport medium Charles Bailey produced two live birds in the séance room. Bailey was unaware that the dealer he had bought the birds from was present in the séance and he was exposed as a fraud. The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall observed the medium Bert Reese in New York and claimed to have discovered his billet reading tricks. The most detailed account at exposing his tricks (with diagrams) was by the magician Theodore Annemann.\n\nThe Polish medium Stanisława Tomczyk's levitation of a glass beaker was exposed and replicated in 1910 by the magician William S. Marriott by means of a hidden thread. The Italian medium Lucia Sordi was exposed in 1911, she was bound to a chair by psychical researchers but would free herself during her séances. The tricks of another Italian medium Linda Gazzera were revealed in the same year, she would release her hands and feet from control in her séances and use them. Gazzera would not permit anyone to search her before a séance sitting, as she concealed muslin and other objects in her hair.\n\nIn 1917, Edward Clodd analyzed the mediumship of the trance medium Gladys Osborne Leonard and came to the conclusion that Leonard had known her séance sitters before she had held the séances, and could have easily obtained such information by natural means. The British psychiatrist Charles Arthur Mercier wrote in his book \"Spiritualism and Sir Oliver Lodge\" (1917) that Oliver Lodge had been duped into believing mediumship by trickery and his spiritualist views were based on assumptions and not scientific evidence.\n\nIn 1918, Joseph Jastrow wrote about the tricks of Eusapia Palladino who was an expert at freeing her hands and feet from the control in the séance room. In the séance room Palladino would move curtains from a distance by releasing a jet of air from a rubber bulb that she had in her hand. According to the psychical researcher Harry Price \"Her tricks were usually childish: long hairs attached to small objects in order to produce 'telekinetic movements'; the gradual substitution of one hand for two when being controlled by sitters; the production of 'phenomena' with a foot which had been surreptitiously removed from its shoe and so on.\"\n\nIn the 1920s the British medium Charles Albert Beare duped the Spiritualist organization the Temple of Light into believing he had genuine mediumship powers. In 1931 Beare published a confession in the newspaper \"Daily Express\". In the confession he stated \"I have deceived hundreds of people…. I have been guilty of fraud and deception in spiritualistic practices by pretending that I was controlled by a spirit guide…. I am frankly and whole-heartedly sorry that I have allowed myself to deceive people.\" Due to the exposure of William Hope and other fraudulent spiritualists, Arthur Conan Doyle in the 1920s led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the Society for Psychical Research, as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism.\n\nBetween 8 November and 31 December 1920 Gustav Geley of the Institute Metapsychique International attended fourteen séances with the medium Franek Kluski in Paris. A bowl of hot paraffin was placed in the room and according to Kluski spirits dipped their limbs into the paraffin and then into a bath of water to materialize. Three other series of séances were held in Warsaw in Kluski's own apartment, these took place over a period of three years. Kluski was not searched in any of the séances. Photographs of the molds were obtained during the four series of experiments and were published by Geley in 1924. Harry Houdini replicated the Kluski materialization moulds by using his hands and a bowl of hot paraffin.\n\nThe British direct-voice medium Frederick Tansley Munnings was exposed as a fraud when one of his séance sitters turned the lights on which revealed him to be holding a trumpet by means of a telescopic extension piece and using an angle piece to change the auditory effect of his voice. Richard Hodgson held six sittings with the medium Rosina Thompson and came to the conclusion she was a fraud as he discovered Thompson had access to documents and information about her séance sitters.\n\nOn 4 February 1922, Harry Price with James Seymour, Eric Dingwall and William S. Marriott had proven the spirit photographer William Hope was a fraud during tests at the British College of Psychic Science. Price wrote in his SPR report \"William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately substituting his own plates for those of a sitter... It implies that the medium brings to the sitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent purposes.\" The medium Kathleen Goligher was investigated by the physicist Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe. On July 22, 1921 in a séance he observed Goligher holding the table up with her foot. He also discovered that her ectoplasm was made of muslin. During a séance d'Albe observed white muslin between Goligher's feet.\n\nThe Danish medium Einer Nielsen was investigated by a committee from the Kristiania University in Norway, 1922 and discovered in a séance that his ectoplasm was fake. In 1923 the Polish medium Jan Guzyk was exposed as a fraud in a series of séances in Sorbonne in Paris. Guzyk would use his elbows and legs to move objects around the room and touch the sitters. According to Max Dessoir the trick of Guzyk was to use his \"foot for psychic touches and sounds\".\n\nThe psychical researchers Eric Dingwall and Harry Price re-published an anonymous work written by a former medium entitled \"Revelations of a Spirit Medium\" (1922) which exposed the tricks of mediumship and the fraudulent methods of producing \"spirit hands\". Originally all the copies of the book were bought up by spiritualists and deliberately destroyed. In 1923, the magician Carlos María de Heredia revealed how fake spirit hands could be made by using a rubber glove, paraffin and a jar of cold water.\n\nThe Hungarian medium Ladislas Lasslo confessed that all of his spirit materializations were fraudulent in 1924. A séance sitter was also found to be working as a confederate for Lasslo.\n\nThe Austrian medium Rudi Schneider was investigated in 1924 by the physicists Stefan Meyer and Karl Przibram. They caught Rudi freeing his arm in a series of séances. Rudi claimed he could levitate objects but according to Harry Price a photograph taken on April 28, 1932 showed that Rudi had managed to free his arm to move a handkerchief from the table. According to Warren Jay Vinton, Schneider was an expert at freeing himself from control in the séance room. Oliver Gatty and Theodore Besterman who tested Schneider concluded that in their tests there was \"no good evidence that Rudi Schneider possesses supernormal powers.\"\n\nThe spiritualists Arthur Conan Doyle and W. T. Stead were duped into believing Julius and Agnes Zancig had genuine psychic powers. Both Doyle and Stead wrote that the Zancigs performed telepathy. In 1924 Julius and Agnes Zancig confessed that their mind reading act was a trick and published the secret code and all the details of the trick method they had used under the title of \"Our Secrets!!\" in a London Newspaper.\n\nIn 1925, Samuel Soal claimed to have taken part in a series of séances with the medium Blanche Cooper who contacted the spirit of a soldier Gordon Davis and revealed the house that he had lived in. Researchers later discovered fraud as the séances had taken place in 1922, not 1925. The magician and paranormal investigator Bob Couttie revealed that Davis was alive, Soal lived close to him and had altered the records of the sittings after checking out the house. Soal's co-workers knew that he had fiddled the results but were kept quiet with threats of libel suits.\n\nMina Crandon claimed to materialize a \"spirit hand\", but when examined by biologists the hand was discovered to be made from a piece of carved animal liver. The German apport medium Heinrich Melzer was discovered to be a fraud in 1926. In a séance psychical researchers found that Melzer had small stones attached to the back of his ears by flesh coloured tape. Psychical researchers who investigated the mediumship of Maria Silbert revealed that she used her feet and toes to move objects in the séance room.\n\nIn 1930 the Polish medium Stanisława P. was tested at the Institut Metapsychique in Paris. French psychical researcher Eugéne Osty suspected in the séance that Stanislawa had freed her hand from control. Secret flashlight photographs that were taken revealed that her hand was free and she had moved objects on the séance table. It was claimed by spiritualists that during a series of séances in 1930 the medium Eileen J. Garrett channeled secret information from the spirit of the Lieutenant Herbert Carmichael Irwin who had died in the R101 crash a few days before the séance. Researcher Melvin Harris who studied the case wrote that the information described in Garrett's séances were \"either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobblede-gook. The so-called secret information just doesn't exist.\"\nIn the 1930s Harry Price (director of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research) had investigated the medium Helen Duncan and had her perform a number of test séances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as \"ectoplasm\". Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was made of cheesecloth. Helen Duncan would also use a doll made of a painted papier-mâché mask draped in an old sheet which she pretended to her sitters was a spirit. The photographs taken by Thomas Glendenning Hamilton in the 1930s of ectoplasm reveal the substance to be made of tissue paper and magazine cut-outs of people. The famous photograph taken by Hamilton of the medium Mary Ann Marshall depicts tissue paper with a cut out of Arthur Conan Doyle's head from a newspaper. Skeptics have suspected that Hamilton may have been behind the hoax.\n\nPsychologists and researchers who studied Pearl Curran's automatic writings in the 1930s came to the conclusion Patience Worth was a fictitious creation of Curran. In 1931 George Valiantine was exposed as a fraud in the séance room as it was discovered that he produced fraudulent \"spirit\" fingerprints in wax. The \"spirit\" thumbprint that Valiantine claimed belonged to Arthur Conan Doyle was revealed to be the print of his big toe on his right foot. It was also revealed that Valiantine made some of the prints with his elbow.\n\nThe medium Frank Decker was exposed as a fraud in 1932. A magician and séance sitter who called himself M. Taylor presented a mail bag and Decker agreed to lock himself inside it. During the séance objects were moved around the room and it was claimed spirits had released Decker from the bag. It was later discovered to have been a trick as Martin Sunshine, a magic dealer admitted that he sold Decker a trick mail bag, such as stage escapologists use, and had acted as the medium's confederate by pretending to be M. Taylor, a magician. The British medium Estelle Roberts claimed to materialize an Indian spirit guide called \"Red Cloud\". Researcher Melvin Harris who examined some photographs of Red Cloud wrote the face was the same as Roberts and she had dressed up in a feathered war-bonnet.\n\nIn 1936, the psychical researcher Nandor Fodor tested the Hungarian apport medium Lajos Pap in London and during the séance a dead snake appeared. Pap was searched and was found to be wearing a device under his robe, where he had hidden the snake. A photograph taken at a séance in 1937 in London shows the medium Colin Evans \"levitating\" in mid air. He claimed that spirits had lifted him. Evans was later discovered to be a fraud as a cord leading from a device in his hand has indicated that it was himself who triggered the flash-photograph and that all he had done was jump from his chair into the air and pretend he had levitated.\n\nAccording to the magician John Booth the stage mentalist David Devant managed to fool a number of people into believing he had genuine psychic ability who did not realize that his feats were magic tricks. At St. George's Hall, London he performed a fake \"clairvoyant\" act where he would read a message sealed inside an envelope. The spiritualist Oliver Lodge who was present in the audience was duped by the trick and claimed that Devant had used psychic powers. In 1936 Devant in his book \"Secrets of My Magic\" revealed the trick method he had used.\n\nThe physicist Kristian Birkeland exposed the fraud of the direct voice medium Etta Wriedt. Birkeland turned on the lights during a séance, snatched her trumpets and discovered that the \"spirit\" noises were caused by chemical explosions induced by potassium and water and in other cases by lycopodium powder. The British medium Isa Northage claimed to materialize the spirit of a surgeon known as Dr. Reynolds. When photographs taken of Reynolds were analyzed by researchers they discovered that Northage looked like Reynolds with a glued stage beard.\n\nThe magician Julien Proskauer revealed that the levitating trumpet of Jack Webber was a trick. Close examination of photographs reveal Webber to be holding a telescopic reaching rod attached to the trumpet, and sitters in his séances only believed it to have levitated because the room was so dark they could not see the rod. Webber would cover the rod with crepe paper to disguise its real construction.\nIn 1954, the psychical researcher Rudolf Lambert published a report revealing details about a case of fraud that was covered up by many early members of the Institute Metapsychique International (IMI). Lambert who had studied Gustav Geley's files on the medium Eva Carrière discovered photographs depicting fraudulent ectoplasm taken by her companion Juliette Bisson. Various \"materializations\" were artificially attached to Eva's hair by wires. The discovery was never published by Geley. Eugéne Osty (the director of the institute) and members Jean Meyer, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing and Charles Richet all knew about the fraudulent photographs but were firm believers in mediumship phenomena so demanded the scandal be kept secret.\n\nThe fraudulent medium Ronald Edwin confessed he had duped his séance sitters and revealed the fraudulent methods he had used in his book \"Clock Without Hands\" (1955). The psychical researcher Tony Cornell investigated the mediumship of Alec Harris in 1955. During the séance \"spirit\" materializations emerged from a cabinet and walked around the room. Cornell wrote that a stomach rumble, nicotine smelling breath and a pulse gave it away that all the spirit figures were in fact Harris and that he had dressed up as each one behind the cabinet.\n\nThe British medium William Roy earned over £50,000 from his séance sitters. He confessed to fraud in 1958 revealing the microphone and trick-apparatus that he had used. The automatic writings of the Irish medium Geraldine Cummins were analyzed by psychical researchers in the 1960s and they revealed that she worked as a cataloguer at the National Library of Ireland and took information from various books that would appear in her automatic writings about ancient history.\n\nIn 1960, psychic investigator Andrija Puharich and Tom O'Neill, publisher of the Spiritualist magazine \"Psychic Observer\", arranged to film two seances at Camp Chesterfield, Indiana using infrared film, intending to procure scientific proof of spirit materializations. The medium was shown the camera beforehand, and was aware that she was being filmed. However, the film revealed obvious fraud on the part of the medium and her cabinet assistant. The exposé was published in the 10 July 1960 issue of the \"Psychic Observer\".\n\nIn 1966 the son of Bishop Pike committed suicide. After his death, Pike contacted the British medium Ena Twigg for a series of séances and she claimed to have communicated with his son. Although Twigg denied formerly knowing anything about Pike and his son, the magician John Booth discovered that Twigg had already known information about the Pike family before the séances. Twigg had belonged to the same denomination of Bishop Pike, he had preached at a cathedral in Kent and she had known information about him and his deceased son from newspapers.\n\nIn 1970 two psychical researchers investigated the direct-voice medium Leslie Flint and found that all the \"spirit\" voices in his séance sounded exactly like himself and attributed his mediumship to \"second-rate ventriloquism\". The medium Arthur Ford died leaving specific instructions that all of his files should be burned. In 1971 after his death, psychical researchers discovered his files but instead of burning them they were examined and discovered to be filled with obituaries, newspaper articles and other information, which enabled Ford to research his séance sitters backgrounds.\n\nRonald Pearsall in his book \"Table-rappers: The Victorians and the Occult\" (1972) documented how every Victorian medium investigated had been exposed as using trickery, in the book he revealed how mediums would even use acrobatic techniques during séances to convince audiences of spirit presences.\n\nIn 1976, M. Lamar Keene, a medium in Florida and at the Spiritualist Camp Chesterfield in Indiana, confessed to defrauding the public in his book \"The Psychic Mafia\". Keene detailed a multitude of common stage magic techniques utilized by mediums which are supposed to give an appearance of paranormal powers or supernatural involvement.\n\nAfter her death in the 1980s the medium Doris Stokes was accused of fraud, by author and investigator Ian Wilson. Wilson stated that Mrs Stokes planted specific people in her audience and did prior research into her sitters. Rita Goold a physical medium during the 1980s was accused of fraud, by the psychical researcher Tony Cornell. He claimed she would dress up as the spirits in her séances and would play music during them which provided cover for her to change clothes.\nThe British journalist Ruth Brandon published the book \"The Spiritualists\" (1983) which exposed the fraud of the Victorian mediums. The book received positive reviews and has been influential to skeptics of spiritualism. The British apport medium Paul McElhoney was exposed as a fraud during a séance in Osset, Yorkshire in 1983. The tape recorder that McElhoney took to his séances was investigated and a black tape was discovered bound around the battery compartment and inside carnation flowers were found as well as a key-ring torch and other objects.\n\nIn 1988, the magician Bob Couttie criticized the paranormal author Brian Inglis for deliberately ignoring evidence of fraud in mediumship. Couttie wrote Inglis had not familiarized himself with magician techniques. In 1990 the researcher Gordon Stein discovered that the levitation photograph of the medium Carmine Mirabelli was fraudulent. The photograph was a trick as there were signs of chemical retouching under Mirabelli's feet. The retouching showed that Mirabelli was not levitating but was standing on a ladder which was erased from the photograph.\n\nIn 1991, Wendy Grossman in the \"New Scientist\" criticized the parapsychologist Stephen E. Braude for ignoring evidence of fraud in mediumship. According to Grossman \"[Braude] accuses sceptics of ignoring the evidence he believes is solid, but himself ignores evidence that does not suit him. If a medium was caught cheating on some occasions, he says, the rest of that medium's phenomena were still genuine.\" Grossman came to the conclusion that Braude did not do proper research on the subject and should study \"the art of conjuring.\"\n\nIn 1992, Richard Wiseman analyzed the Feilding report of Eusapia Palladino and argued that she employed a secret accomplice that could enter the room by a fake door panel positioned near the séance cabinet. Wiseman discovered this trick was already mentioned in a book from 1851, he also visited a carpenter and skilled magician who constructed a door within an hour with a false panel. The accomplice was suspected to be her second husband, who insisted on bringing Palladino to the hotel where the séances took place. Massimo Polidoro and Gian Marco Rinaldi also analyzed the Feilding report but came to the conclusion no secret accomplice was needed as Palladino during the 1908 Naples séances could have produced the phenomena by using her foot.\n\nColin Fry was exposed in 1992 when during a séance the lights were unexpectedly turned on and he was seen holding a spirit trumpet in the air, which the audience had been led to believe was being levitated by spiritual energy. In 1997, Massimo Polidoro and Luigi Garlaschelli produced wax-moulds directly from one's hand which were exactly the same copies as Gustav Geley obtained from Franek Kluski, which are kept at the Institute Metapsychique International.\nA series of mediumistic séances known as the Scole Experiment took place between 1993 and 1998 in the presence of the researchers David Fontana, Arthur Ellison and Montague Keen. This has produced photographs, audio recordings and physical objects which appeared in the dark séance room (known as apports). A criticism of the experiment was that it was flawed because it did not rule out the possibility of fraud. The skeptical investigator Brian Dunning wrote the Scole experiments fail in many ways. The séances were held in the basement of two of the mediums, only total darkness was allowed with no night vision apparatus as it might \"frighten the spirits away\". The box containing the film was not examined and could easily have been accessible to fraud. And finally, even though many years have passed, there has been no follow-up, no further research by any credible agency or published accounts.\n\nThe VERITAS Research Program of the Laboratory for Advances in Consciousness and Health in the Department of Psychology at the University of Arizona, run by the parapsychologist Gary Schwartz, was created primarily to test the hypothesis that the consciousness (or identity) of a person survives physical death. Schwartz claimed his experiments were indicative of survival, but do not yet provide conclusive proof. The experiments described by Schwartz have received criticism from the scientific community for being inadequately designed and using poor controls.\n\nRay Hyman discovered many methodological errors with Schwartz's research including; \"Inappropriate control comparisons\", \"Failure to use double-blind procedures\", \"Creating non-falsifiable outcomes by reinterpreting failures as successes\" and \"Failure to independently check on facts the sitters endorsed as true\". Hyman wrote \"Even if the research program were not compromised by these defects, the claims being made would require replication by independent investigators.\" Hyman criticizes Schwartz's decision to publish his results without gathering \"evidence for their hypothesis that would meet generally accepted scientific criteria... they have lost credibility.\"\n\nIn 2003, skeptic investigator Massimo Polidoro in his book \"Secrets of the Psychics\" documented the history of fraud in mediumship and spiritualistic practices as well as the psychology of psychic deception. Terence Hines in his book \"Pseudoscience and the Paranormal\" (2003) has written:\n\nModern spiritualists and psychics keep detailed files on their victims. As might be expected, these files can be very valuable and are often passed on from one medium or psychic to another when one retires or dies. Even if a psychic doesn't use a private detective or have immediate access to driver's license records and such, there is still a very powerful technique that will allow the psychic to convince people that the psychic knows all about them, their problems, and their deep personal secrets, fears, and desires. The technique is called cold reading and is probably as old as charlatanism itself... If John Edward (or any of the other self-proclaimed speakers with the dead) really could communicate with the dead, it would be a trivial matter to prove it. All that would be necessary would be for him to contact any of the thousands of missing persons who are presumed dead—famous (e.g., Jimmy Hoffa, Judge Crater) or otherwise—and correctly report where the body is. Of course, this is never done. All we get, instead, are platitudes to the effect that Aunt Millie, who liked green plates, is happy on the other side.\n\nAn experiment conducted by the British Psychological Society in 2005 suggests that under the controlled condition of the experiment, people who claimed to be professional mediums do not demonstrate the mediumistic ability. In the experiment, mediums were assigned to work the participants chosen to be \"sitters.\" The mediums claimed to contact the deceased who were related to the sitters. The research gather the numbers of the statements made and have the sitters rate the accuracy of the statements. The readings that were considered to be somewhat accurate by the sitters were very generalized, and the ones that were considered inaccurate were the ones that were very specific.\n\nOn Fox News on the Geraldo at Large show, October 6, 2007, Geraldo Rivera and other investigators accused Schwartz as a fraud as he had overstepped his position as a university researcher by requesting over three million dollars from a bereaved father who had lost his son. Schwartz claimed to have contacted the spirit of a 25-year-old man in the bathroom of his parents house and it is alleged he attempted to charge the family 3.5 million dollars for his mediumship services. Schwartz responded saying that the allegations were set up to destroy his science credibility.\n\nIn 2013 Rose Marks and members of her family were convicted of fraud for a series of crimes spanning 20 years entailing between $20 and $45 million. They told vulnerable clients that to solve their problems they had to give the purported psychics money and valuables. Marks and family promised to return the cash and goods after \"cleansing\" them. Prosecutors established they had no intent to return the property.\n\nThe exposures of fraudulent activity led to a rapid decline in ectoplasm and materialization séances. Investigator Joe Nickell has written that modern self-proclaimed mediums like John Edward, Sylvia Browne, Rosemary Altea and James Van Praagh are avoiding the Victorian tradition of dark rooms, spirit handwriting and flying tambourines as these methods risk exposure. They instead use \"mental mediumship\" tactics like cold reading or gleaning information from sitters beforehand (hot reading). Group readings also improve hits by making general statements with conviction, which will fit at least one person in the audience. Shows are carefully edited before airing to show only what appears to be hits and removing anything that does not reflect well on the medium.\n\nMichael Shermer criticized mediums in \"Scientific American\", saying, \"mediums are unethical and dangerous: they prey on the emotions of the grieving. As grief counselors know, death is best faced head-on as a part of life.\" Shermer wrote that the human urge to seek connections between events that may form patterns meaningful for survival is a function of natural evolution, and called the alleged ability of mediums to talk to the dead \"a well-known illusion of a meaningful pattern.\"\n\nAccording to James Randi, a skeptic who has debunked many claims of psychic ability and uncovered fraudulent practices, mediums who do cold readings \"fish, suggest possibilities, make educated guesses and give options.\" Randi has a standing offer of $1 million US dollars for anyone who can demonstrate psychic ability under controlled conditions. Most prominent psychics and mediums have not taken up his offer.\n\nThe key role in mediumship of this sort is played by \"effect of subjective confirmation\" (see Barnum effect) — people are predisposed to consider reliable that information which though is casual coincidence or a guess, however it seems to them personally important and significant and answers their personal belief.\n\nThe article about this phenomenon in \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" places emphasis that \"… one by one spiritual mediums were convicted of fraud, sometimes using the tricks borrowed from scenic \"magicians\" to convince their paranormal abilities\". In the article it is also noted that \"… the opening of the wide ranging fraud happening on spiritualistic sessions caused serious damage to reputation of the movement of a Spiritualism and in the USA pushed it on the public periphery\".\n\nIn March 2017, medium Thomas John was targeted in a sting operation and caught doing a hot reading. The sting was planned and implemented by skeptical activist Susan Gerbic and mentalist Mark Edward. The unmarried couple attended John's show using aliases, and were \"read\" as a married couple Susanna and Mark Wilson by John. During the entire reading, John failed to determine the actual identities of Gerbic and Edward, or that they were being deceptive during his reading. All personal information he gave them matched what was on their falsified Facebook accounts, rather than being about their actual lives, and John pretended he was getting this information from Gerbic and Edward's supposedly dead—but actually nonexistent—relatives.\n\nAs Jack Hitt reported in The New York Times:\nThese details were from the falsified Facebook accounts for the pair which were prepared by a group of skeptics in advance of the reading, and Gerbic and Edward were not aware of the specific information in these accounts. This blinding was done in order to avoid John later being able to claim he obtained the false information by reading Gerbic and Edward's minds. In her report, Gerbic also revealed that during an after-show private event, John disclosed in a group setting that at least one of the people in the audience which he did a reading about was actually his own student.\n\nThe same week that the Thomas John sting revelation was made in The New York Times, John's claimed mediumship abilities portrayed in the Lifetime reality TV show called \"Seatbelt Psychic\" were challenged by Gerbic in an article published by Skeptical Inquirer. In the show, John is a ride-share driver who surprises “unsuspecting” passengers when he delivers messages from their deceased relatives. Gerbic investigated and revealed that John's passengers are actually actors, several of which are documented in IMDb. Gerbic concluded that the riders were likely hired to ride with John, but were probably not acting when talking with him. She concluded that the details about their lives mentioned by John were easily found on social media sources, and likely fed to John, making the readings actually hot readings. One rider, Wendy Westmoreland, played a character on \"Stalked by a Doctor\", a TV show also produced by Lifetime.\n\n\n"}

He was a commander of Henry VIII and appointed surveyor of the King's works. Lee was member of parliament for Hertfordshire in 1545. He was the first English engineer to be knighted.\n\nBetween 1536 and 1542 Lee was surveyor of works at Calais as the successor of William Lilgrave. He may have been a master mason, and his promotion was due to Thomas Cromwell . In 1538 he returned to England to advise Thomas Wriothesley on the conversion of Titchfield Abbey. Following the dissolution of St Albans Abbey he himself purchased the grounds of the abbey (the abbey church itself was sold by King Edward VI to the people of St Albans in 1553), with Sopwell Priory and the rectorship of St Stephen's church (both of which were nearby). He tore down the priory and built a Tudor house on the site which he named Lee Hall. He also purchased the manor of Abbots Langley.\n\nIn 1539 he was back at Calais implementing plans for re-fortification devised by Henry VIII in 1532. Only brick was available at Calais so Lee shipped freestone and timber from Kent, with salvaged material from the demolished monasteries at Faversham and St. Augustines, Canterbury. Lee constructed a new harbour at Dykeland on the Hammes river for the Kentish ships. In 1541 Lee started building a trefoil shaped bulwark called the Dublin Tower.\n\nDuring the war of the Rough Wooing, in January 1544 Richard was sent into Scotland with the Italian engineers Antonio da Bergamo and John Thomas Scala, as expert men in the skill of fortifying. With the Surveyor of Calais, William Burgate, he joined Lord Hertford's raid on Edinburgh in May 1544. Lee pronounced Edinburgh Castle to be impregnable, and made plans of the town and Leith. He was knighted by Lord Hertford at Leith. Lee is generally believed to have plundered the Dunkeld Lectern from Holyrood Abbey during an attack on Edinburgh in 1544. He certainly took the brass font from Holyrood once used to christen Scottish monarchs. Now destroyed, it was formerly at St Albans with his name and the story of its capture in 1544 was engraved on it.\n\nAfter the battle of Pinkie Cleugh in September 1547, Lee was made General Surveyor of the King's Majesty's works and fortifications in the North parts, for the duration of the Scottish war.\n\nAround 1550-1552 Lee was at Berwick-upon-Tweed constructing the novel trace-italienne fortifications. In 1557 he was trench-master to the Earl of Pembroke in the Netherlands, and in 1558 went to Berwick as Surveyor of Works.\n\nAfter working at Portsmouth, in 1560 Richard was again supervising the re-fortification of Berwick, by correspondence with Rowland Johnston and in person in April. He was to \"set forward the device for Berwick\": to design the new works. Lee also went to the Siege of Leith on 27 April 1560 asked to, \"prick them forward to an end.\" This was probably to help plan the assault on 7 May which failed. Lee made a map of Leith which was sent to London on 15 May 1560. Lee and Pelham, a captain at Leith, were called before Elizabeth I of England in June 1564, perhaps to give their testimony on affairs at Leith. When in London at this period, Lee stayed at the house of Mr. Graisse in Cheapside. In 1565 Lee viewed the site of Lindisfarne Castle on Beblowe Crag.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2269768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269768", "title": "Marsden Grotto", "text": "Marsden Grotto\n\nThe Marsden Grotto, locally known as The Grotto, is a gastropub located on the coast at Marsden in South Shields, Tyne & Wear, England. It is partly dug into the cliff face and fronted with a more conventional building opening onto the beach. The pub is one of the very few \"cave bars\" in Europe, another being Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem in Nottingham.\n\nThe venue includes large bar, the inside cave with another bar and pool room, a bistro, a heated terrace on the beach and a seafood restaurant upstairs. Access is either by lift from the car park or by a zigzag staircase on the cliff at the side of the building. The lift is housed in a brick shaft rising from the front of the building.\n\nA lead miner from Allendale, Jack Bates and his wife Jessie moved to the area in 1782. It is alleged he moved into a small cave at Marsden Rock either after refusing to pay rent on his house in Allendale or simply having nowhere to live. Using explosives from a local quarry, he blasted the small cave into a much larger one, earning his nickname \"Jack the Blaster\" in the process and creating a rent-free and landlord-free home. The dwelling was accessed by zig-zagging stairs down the cliff, thought to be built by Jack. The unusual and eccentric choice of dwelling attracted visitors, which the couple supplied with refreshments at a cost. It is suggested that he became involved in smuggling activities - offering refreshment to smugglers using caves of the coastline to hide contraband cargo.\n\nA local man (although originally from Scotland) and pub landlord, Peter Allan took over the Marsden Grotto and developed it with money allegedly won at the races. His father was the gamekeeper of Sir Hedworth Williamson. Allan restored and extended the caves into a 15-room home including a ballroom and kitchen, turning Jack's house into an inn.\n\nIn 1848 John Clay, who later became the first mayor of the County Borough of South Shields, bought The Leas and claimed that the land gave him rights to The Grotto. Allan battled with Clay in court and was forced to pay £50 costs and £10 annual rent for 20 years. Allan sank into depression and died in 1849 leaving his wife and eight children (both his father and mother also survived him). \n\nAfter Allan’s death his family continued to run The Grotto for an additional 35 years. In this time many improvements were made, along with further excavations implemented by Allan's children. A catastrophic cliff fall in 1865 almost destroyed the inn. Large retaining walls were built to protect the internal structure.\n\nThe Harton Coal Company acquired The Grotto in the latter half of the 19th century. It had substantial success during this period, but it was also allowed to fall into disrepair.\n\nVaux took over The Grotto in 1898. They decided to clean the place up as it was littered with empty beer barrels that draymen would not collect. In 1938 Vaux purchased The Grotto and set upon a large refurbishment program. The buildings joined onto the caves were rebuilt to a high standard. A lift was also added to the surface.\n\nIn 1999 Vaux decided to concentrate more on their hotel and leisure business rather than operate as a brewery. A buyer could not be found for the Marsden Grotto and it closed down.\n\nThe Sunderland restaurant firm, Tavistock, purchased The Grotto in a poor condition. The premises were totally refurbished and The Grotto opened as a high class seafood restaurant and bar. Following its purchase of the Roker Hotel in Sunderland, Tavistock was made an offer it could not refuse and The Grotto was sold to London Inns & Restaurants in 2003. The Grotto later passed to Oxford Hotels and Inns Management Ltd.. In September 2007, South Tyneside Council, who are responsible for the stairs adjacent to the pub, closed them off due to a damaged step, pending repair. Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service ordered the pub be temporally closed to the public until the stairs reopen as they are the only means of safe evacuation from the pub, especially at high tide. The Grotto reopened on 21 March 2008.\n\nThere have long been tales of hauntings at The Grotto, mainly relating to a smuggler named John the Jibber who was reputedly murdered by his fellow criminals after selling information to HM Customs. It is said that he was hung in a barrel in a cave close to the present lift shaft and left to starve. Until the pub was sold by Vaux, it was said that the landlord would leave out a special tankard of ale each night after closing and, in the morning, it would be empty. Local DJ and TV presenter, Alan Robson drank from the tankard during one of his live Metro Radio shows, allegedly sparking off a series of supernatural phenomena that eventually forced the then landlord to quit. This included flying ashtrays smashing against the wall and flooding in the cellar after all the beer taps were inexplicably turned on.\n\nThe original tankard was lost during refurbishment. A replacement is on display, but is no longer filled up each night for the ghost. The pub was also the venue for a UKTV investigation in 2001, where paranormal researchers claimed to have identified at least seven different ghosts.\n\nThe novel \"Schoolfrenz\" by Ray Crowther is set mainly on Tyneside. The Marsden Grotto is mentioned several times and is the location for the climax of the book. The author's website contains an extract from \"Schoolfrenz\" about Marsden Grotto, and has additional photographs of the Grotto and the surrounding area.\n\n"}
{"id": "2269771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269771", "title": "Oxford Capacity Analysis", "text": "Oxford Capacity Analysis\n\nThe Oxford Capacity Analysis (OCA), also known as the American Personality Analysis, is a list of questions which is advertised as being a personality test and that is administered for free by the Church of Scientology. The OCA test is offered by the Church of Scientology online, at its local churches, and sometimes at local fairs, carnivals, and in other public settings. It has no relation to the University of Oxford, although the name may have been chosen to imply so.\n\nThe test is an important part of Scientology recruitment and is used worldwide by the Church of Scientology to attract new members. However, it is not a scientifically recognized test and has been criticized by numerous psychology organizations, who point out that it is \"not a genuine personality test\" and allege that Scientologists use it in a \"highly manipulative\" and \"manifestly unethical\" fashion.\n\nTwo hundred questions make up the Scientology personality test. Each can be answered \"yes\", \"no\", or \"maybe\". Typical questions include:\n\nThe OCA test is often given at the same time as a \"Novis Mental Ability Test,\" a short 30 minute test which is claimed to measure IQ. After the two tests have been completed, a computer program is used to plot the results on a personality profile graph. This gives the testee's IQ rating and score in personality characteristics such as \"Stable,\" \"Happy,\" \"Composed,\" \"Certainty,\" \"Active,\" \"Aggressive,\" \"Responsible (Causative),\" \"Correct Estimation\" (meaning the testee's ability to look at a situation and determine what is needed to deal with it), \"Appreciative,\" and \"Comm[unication] Level\" (meaning the testee's ability to communicate with others).\n\nThe scale on the graph of each trait ranges from +100 to −100, with three main bands marked \"Desirable State\" (+100 to +30), \"Normal\" (+30 to 0) and \"Unacceptable State\" (0 to −100). In the middle are two shaded bands, \"Acceptable under perfect conditions\" (about +32 to about +6) and \"Attention Desirable\" (about +6 to about −18). A legend at the foot of the graph sheet warns that a point below the latter band indicates \"Attention Urgent.\"\nAfter the graph has been plotted, a Scientology staff member reviews the results with the testee.\n\nEven before the Church of Scientology had fashioned its own test, founder L. Ron Hubbard made personality tests central to his religion. In his 1951 book \"Science of Survival\", he recommended the use of existing psychometric exams, including the California Test for Mental Maturity.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the project to create Hubbard's own test got underway. He commissioned a longtime follower, Julia Salman Lewis, to produce one. Her first effort, the American Personality Analysis (APA), failed to satisfy Hubbard. So in 1959 he asked a friend and fellow churchman, Ray Kemp, to broaden the scope of the test. Wrote Kemp:\n\nThe church first announced its test in an article by Kemp, who hailed the OCA in the pages of \"Certainty\", the magazine of the Hubbard Association of Scientologists in London. Later, the church gave credit to Hubbard for the test and trademarked the terms \"OCA\" and \"Oxford Capacity Analysis.\" The copyright holder is \"L. Ron Hubbard Library,\" a business alias of the Religious Technology Center.\n\nAt first the church just tested its members, not the public. Then in 1960, a recruitment drive in Johannesburg, South Africa was run. The South African campaign had kicked off with a newspaper ad:\n\nRespondents were tested in the Johannesburg Scientology office, having been told:\n\nHubbard proclaimed it \"the hottest, fastest procurement service set up we have ever had.\" He announced that the new \"Personal Efficiency Test Program,\" utilising the OCA, would be rolled out across Scientology in the next few months. Since then, OCA tests have been one of the most visible means by which the Church of Scientology attempts to attract new members.\n\nThe OCA is today used for two principal purposes. Within the Church of Scientology, it is used to test for improvement in the personality of a \"preclear\" (a novice Scientologist) and the effectiveness of the chosen Scientology \"process\". OCA evaluations are conducted regularly and recorded, following Hubbard's instructions:\n\nThe other use, more visible to non-Scientologists, is that of recruitment, using the OCA as a tool to attract new people for Scientology services. In a 1960 policy letter, Hubbard wrote:\n\nThe results of the test are invariably negative, as various reporters have found:\n\nFormer Scientologists have spoken of how \"everything that's wrong with [people]\" is purposefully emphasized in OCA test results. Individuals who have undertaken the OCA have described how they were given just such negative evaluations; as one young Sydney woman put it in an interview in 1980,\n\nHubbard advised that the hopelessness of the testee's predicament (or \"ruin,\" as he put it) should be emphasized by the tester, who should continually state that Scientology services are what is necessary for the situation to be salvaged:\n\nThe evaluator generally follows a script (Pre-written answers based on the test takers score.) originally devised by South African Scientologist Peter Greene around 1960/61, which Hubbard instructs \"must be studied and learned by heart\" by evaluators. Although the analysis is represented as being \"not our opinion of you, but ... a factual scientific analysis taken from your answers,\" it relies heavily on scripted responses set out in detail in the \"OCA Automatic Evaluation Script\".\n\nThe evaluator is instructed to recommend Scientology as the only viable remedy for such problems. Alternatives are to be mentioned — \"psychology, psychoanalysis, Dale Carnegie, Confidence Courses, Mental Exercises\" — but only for the purpose of dismissing them: \"these things had a very limited application and you could get yourself terribly involved in mysteries, expenses and wasted time, before you found any solutions to your difficulties. All across the world today, people are coming to us, to find simpler, more straight forward answers.\"\n\nThe vehemence with which OCA test evaluators attempt to \"impinge\" has attracted comment from non-Scientologists who have undergone the test. Writing in 1970, a British psychologist who underwent the test noted that\n\nIf an IQ test is added to the regular OCA examination, Scientology is likewise promoted as being essential no matter what the results — for everything from raising a low IQ to managing a high IQ. Hubbard provides four levels of grading for this test, for each of which there is a scripted response:\n\nThe OCA is licensed to Scientologist-owned companies through the World Institute of Scientology Enterprises. It has been used for a variety of purposes, most commonly employee screening.\n\nSome Scientologist doctors use the test to evaluate patients. Los Angeles celebrity plastic surgeon Dr. Edward Terino rates his patients on a \"Trouble Scale\" after administering the test, which he markets to doctors via a company called Surgeon's Insight. Terino, a Scientologist, adopted the test after being threatened with injuries by a husband who hated Terino's nose-job work.\n\nIt has often been used without alteration, but has also been issued in modified versions; for instance, MasterTech markets the OCA with minor changes and calls it the Personnel Potential Analysis Test.\n\nPsychologists have assailed the test's lack of scientific basis. Other critics call it intentionally manipulative and humiliating.\n\n\"The overall impression one gets [from the test manual],\" said a psychologist testifying before a public inquiry into Scientology in Victoria, Australia in the mid-1960s, \"is that it has been prepared by somebody with a smattering of psychometrics rather than by someone who is really competent in the field.\" A more detailed investigation was undertaken in 1970 by the British Psychological Society (BPS) at the request of politician Sir John Foster. The group's conclusions:\n\nAnother detailed evaluation was carried out in 1981 by Gudmund Smith, Professor Emeritus at the Institute of Psychology of the University of Lund, Sweden. This time the investigation was done for a prosecutor attacking a local branch of Narconon, the church's drug rehab offshoot. Smith cited numerous methodological and empirical flaws in the OCA, describing it as a \"terrible mess,\" and concluded (in translation from the original Swedish):\n\nThe OCA also came under scrutiny in Queensland, Australia in 1990, when it emerged that scores of people had lost their jobs after a Brisbane-based personnel management company had given them poor OCA evaluations, \"us[ing] such brutal terms they can read like character assassinations, leaving employers with little choice but to fire staff.\" The Australian Psychological Society denounced the OCA as \"downright dangerous,\" commenting that\n\nThe Church of Scientology has reportedly been unable to produce information to substantiate the validity of the Oxford Capacity Analysis. This has attracted criticism from the Buros Institute of Mental Measurements in Lincoln, Nebraska, which produces the \"Mental Measurements Yearbook\" — the industry \"bible\" for psychological tests. According to the institute, \"Any group should include information that substantiates the use of its test. If they can't, then it doesn't meet the standards for educational and psychological tests.\"\n\nThe OCA evaluators' criticism of their test subjects' personalities has also drawn sharp criticism. A London \"Evening Standard\" reporter described the unease she felt after she had taken the OCA test:\n\nPsychologists have echoed this critique. The methodological flaws of the OCA were such that, in the view of Professor Gudmund Smith, \"Analysis for evaluation of an individual is, in my opinion, manifestly unethical.\" Testifying in a court case in Ireland in 2003, Dr Declan Fitzgerald of University College Dublin said he believed that the OCA \"impinged on people's self-esteem and was highly manipulative.\" In its 1970 report, the British Psychological Society's working party was even harsher with its criticism, declaring that\n\nEven the name of the Oxford Capacity Analysis has been criticized as misleading. \"The Times\" comments that the test \"has nothing to do with Oxford University\" and says that \"Scientologists use the word \"Oxford\" to give it credence.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2269818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269818", "title": "Kremenets", "text": "Kremenets\n\nKremenets (, translit. \"Kremianets&apos;\", \"Kremenets&apos;\"; ; ) is a city of regional significance in the Ternopil Oblast (province) of western Ukraine. It is the administrative center of the Kremenets Raion (district), and lies 18 km north-east of the great Pochayiv Monastery. The city is situated in the historic region of Volhynia.\n\nAccording to some sources the Kremenets fortress was built in the 8th or 9th century, and later became a part of Kievan Rus'. The first documented reference to the fortress is given in a Polish encyclopedic dictionary written in 1064. The first reference to Kremenets in Old Slavic literature dates from 1226 when the city's ruler, Mstislav the Bold, defeated the Hungarian army of King Andrew II nearby. During the Mongol invasion of Rus in 1240-41, Kremenets was one of few cities that Batu Khan failed to capture. In 1382, after the death of Louis I of Hungary, Lithuanian duke Liubartas captured Kremenets from the Kingdom of Hungary. The city obtained Magdeburg rights in 1431, and in 1569, after the Union of Lublin, it became part of Crown of Poland, known as .\n\nIn the fall of 1648 Cossack Colonel Maxym Kryvonis surrounded the Kremenets fortress. In October, after a six-week siege, the royal garrison surrendered. As a consequence of the fighting, the fortress was severely damaged and was never rebuilt. In 1795 Kremenets was annexed by the Russian Empire following the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It remained a part of Russia until World War I.\n\nDuring 1917-1920 Kremenets 7 times passed from hand to hand. The authorities Ukrainian state - Ukrainian People's Republic - it was subject to early 1918 to June 1919.\n\nIn 1921, following Peace of Riga, the town returned to Poland, and was part of Volhynian Voivodeship (Wołyń) .\n\nIn the interwar period, Kremenets was famous for its renowned high school, Liceum Krzemienieckie, founded in 1803 by Tadeusz Czacki. According to the 1931 Polish census, the town had a population of 19,877, with 8,428 Ukrainians, 6,904 Jews, 3,108 Poles and 883 Russians. In 1934, upon initiative of Ludwik Gronowski, teacher of the Kremenets High School, Volhynian School of Gliding Sokola Góra (Wołyńska Szkoła Szybowcowa Sokola Góra) was opened 14 kilometers from Kremenets, in the village of Kulików. Among its students was the daughter of Jozef Piłsudski, Jadwiga Piłsudska.\n\nIn September 1939, the Polish government was temporarily located in Kremenets, which during this time was subject to heavy aerial bombing until captured by invading Soviet forces on 17 September. By then the government had evacuated Kremenets and was on its way to neutral Romania.\n\nOn July 28, 1941, most of the teachers of the Krzemieniec High School were arrested by the Germans, who used a list provided to them by local Ukrainians. By the end of the month, 30 teachers and members of Polish intelligentsia were murdered at the so-called Hill of Crosses (Góra Krzyżów).\n\nIn January 1989 the population was 24 570 people.\n\nDuring the restoration of Ukrainian statehood in 1991, was restored Kremenets Botanical Garden (1991), created Kremenetsko-Pochaivskiy State Historical-Architectural Reserve (2001), opened Kremenetskiy Regional Humanitarian Pedagogical Institute n. Shevchenko (2002), Kremenetskiy Regional Museum Juliusz Slowacki (2003), increasing the flow of tourists. In 1991 at the Teachers College Shevchenko created a modern Kremenets Lyceum.\n\nJews are known to have settled in the Kremenets area as early as 1438, when the Grand Duke of Lithuania gave them a charter. However, in 1495, Lithuania expelled its Jews until 1503. A Polish Yeshiva, however, operated in Kremenets during the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nThe Jewish community expanded and prospered through the 16th century. Around the middle of the century, rabbinical representatives of the Kahals of Poland began gathering at the great Fairs to conduct the business of the Jewish communities. These conferences became known as the Council of the Four Lands. Volhynian representatives were from Ostroh and Kremenets.\n\nKhmelnytsky's Cossack uprising against the Polish land owners from 1648 through 1651, followed by the Russian-Swedish wars against Poland-Lithuania from 1654-1656, devastated the Jewish population of western Ukraine. Many Jews, many of which were stewards of magnates, were murdered, while others fled. Jews were not allowed to rebuild their destroyed homes. Kremenets never again regained its former importance. All that was left as the Russians took control in 1793 was \"an impoverished community of petty traders and craftsmen.\"\n\nIn 1747, Kremenets was the site of a well-publicized blood libel trial in which 14 Jews were accused of murdering a Christian to obtain blood for making matzo – a false accusation dating back to the Middle Ages. The incident began when an unidentified corpse was found near an inn and curious townsfolk gathered around to view the body. When some Jews joined the crowd, the corpse supposedly began to bleed, thus supernaturally demonstrating their guilt. Twelve of the Jews confessed under torture (placed on the rack and burned with red-hot irons). Most were gruesomely executed by being flayed, quartered and impaled while still alive, by orders of the Christian civil authorities.\n\nJewish life gradually revived and Kremenets became a secondary center of Haskalah (enlightenment) in Eastern Europe in the period 1772 through 1781. By the end of the 19th century, Jews once again were active in the economic life of the town, primarily in the paper industry and as cobblers and carpenters. They exported their goods to other towns in Russia and Poland. Under Polish rule, in the early 1930s, two Yiddish periodicals were published. They merged in 1933 into a single weekly newspaper, \"Kremenitser Lebn\" (\"Kremenets Life\").\n\nThe Nazis destroyed the Jewish community of Kremenets. Except for those who left Kremenets before the war and 14 survivors, all 15,000 Jews who lived in Kremenets in 1941 were murdered.\n\nThe Soviet authorities annexed the town on September 22, 1939. In the spring of 1940, the refugees from western Poland were obliged to register with the authorities and to declare whether they wished to take up Soviet citizenship or return to their former homes, now under German occupation. Jewish communal life was forbidden, and Zionist leaders were forced to move to other cities to keep their past activities from the knowledge of the authorities. By 1941 the Jewish population had increased to over 15,000 including over 4,000 refugees.\n\nIn June 1941, the German Einsatzgruppe \"C\" carried out a mass slaughter of Jews in the Generalbezirk Wolhynien-Podolien District, which was part of Reichskommissariat Ukraine. The District included all of Volhynia.\n\n\"A few days after the German-Soviet war broke out (June 22, 1941) the Germans reached the area. Hundreds of young Jews managed to flee to the Soviet Union. A pogrom broke out in early July 1941, where 800 men, women and children were killed. In August 1941 the Gestapo ordered all Jews with academic status to report for registration. All those who did so were murdered, and the Jewish community's leadership was destroyed. That month the Germans set fire to the main synagogue and exacted a fine of 11 kg. of gold from the community.\n\nA Judenrat was imposed. The head, Benjamin Katz was murdered for his refusal to collaborate with the Nazis. At the end of January 1942 a ghetto was established and on March 1 was closed off from the rest of the city. The inmates endured great hardship and there was a serious shortage of water.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, the Germans began the systematic liquidation of the ghettos in the provincial towns. In some of them revolts broke out, the ghetto inmates resisting their deportation, setting the ghetto houses on fire and making mass attempts to escape to the forests. Nesvizh, Mir, Lachva, Kletsk, and Kremenets were some of the places where ghetto revolts occurred.\n\nOn July 22, 1942, there was armed resistance by the Jews of the Kremenets ghetto against the Germans, who were trying to exterminate them. The Kremenets ghetto's lasted for two weeks, and 19,000 Jews were murdered.\n\nOn August 10, 1942, the Germans initiated a two-week-long Aktion to annihilate the inmates, setting the ghetto ablaze to drive out those in hiding. Fifteen hundred able-bodied persons were dispatched as slave laborers to Bilokrynytsia, where they later met their death. The vast majority of the ghetto inhabitants rounded up in the Aktion were taken in groups and murdered over trenches dug near the railway station, near a former army camp. The local Zionist leader Benjamin Landsberg committed suicide. Only 14 of the Kremenets community survived the Holocaust. Societies of former residents of Kremenets function in Israel, the United States and Argentina.\n\nAlthough the Jewish presence in Kremenets was physically destroyed, the memory of Jewish Kremenetsers lived on. In the postwar years, those who successfully emigrated before the onset of hostilities, survivors of the Holocaust, and their descendants published two Yizkor Books and a series of memorial Bulletins.\n\nToday the economy of Kremenets is supported by Orthodox pilgrims who come to visit the cathedrals, the nunnery, and the nearby Pochayiv Lavra as well as by Polish tourists visiting the Juliusz Słowacki museum. The museum was opened in 2002, with financial help of the government of Poland, which provided one million dollars for the project. There is also a large sugar refinery, but the plant was closed during the financial crisis of 2007–2010.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a modern formulation of David Hume's principle of contiguity.\n\nTobler first presented his seminal idea during a meeting of the International Geographical Union's Commission on Qualitative Methods held in 1969 and later published by him in 1970. Though simple in its presentation, this idea is profound. Without it, \"the full range of conditions anywhere on the Earth's surface could in principle be found packed within any small area. There would be no regions of approximately homogeneous conditions to be described by giving attributes to area objects. Topographic surfaces would vary chaotically, with slopes that were everywhere infinite, and the contours of such surfaces would be infinitely dense and contorted. Spatial analysis, and indeed life itself, would be impossible.\"\n\nLess well known is his second law, which complements the first: \"The phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside\".\n\nThe theory is based upon the concept of the friction of distance \"where distance itself hinders interaction between places. The farther two places are apart, the greater the hindrance\", or cost. For example, one is less likely to travel across town to purchase a sandwich than walk to the corner store for the same sandwich. In this example hindrance, or cost, can readily be counted in time (amount of time as well as value of time), transportation costs and personal muscle energy loss which are added to the price of the purchase and thus result in high levels of friction. The friction of distance and the increase in cost combine causing the distance decay effect.\n"}

Two years later, a warrant was issued for his arrest after he opposed and obstructed the destruction of a local school building. He fled to Mount Aso in central Kyūshū, where he stayed in an inn for a long period, the place he claims to have had a face-to-face encounter with God. Teshima returned home and discovered the warrant had been retracted. His experience at Mt. Aso compelled him to begin a life of ministry. He set up a Bible study group which quickly grew into a movement known as Genshi Fukuin Undo (lit., Original Gospel Movement), and then as Makuya. To grasp the inner truth of biblical religion, or the \"Love of the Holy Spirit\" as Teshima puts it, and to extol this existential love by embodying it, living accordingly was the essence of his religious life. Teshima died on Christmas Dawn in 1973.\n\nTeshima was fervently identified with the cause of Israel, conceiving the establishment of the State of Israel and the unification of Jerusalem as a fulfillment of biblical prophecies. His group, Makuya, has sent young members to a number of kibbutzim in Israel and made pilgrimages to Jerusalem. \"Over [900] Makuya students have been sent to Israeli kibbutzim to work together with the people of the Bible, and to study Hebrew and the biblical background. Some of them continue their academic studies in universities.\" The primary kibbutz the Makuya students stay at is Heftziba. Makuya has also appeared in front of the United Nations on at least two occasions, speaking on behalf of Israel.\n\nIn 1967, when the Six-Day War broke out, Teshima wrote a telegram to the Makuya students in Israel saying, \"Stay as long as you can and help Israel\". The students, accordingly, volunteered to aid Israel during the war. In 1973, when the Yom Kippur War broke out, the state of Japan supported Arab countries, caving in to an Arab oil embargo. This diplomatic policy frustrated Teshima. Despite his serious illness (terminal cirrhosis), Teshima organized, with 3,000 of his adherents, a campaign for Israel in front of the Diet building in Tokyo. It was the first pro-Israel demonstration ever held in Japan. The campaign received wide coverage in the press, radio, and television. However, it also worsened Teshima's illness and he died three weeks later on Christmas Dawn in 1973.\n\nTeshima's name was inscribed twice on the Golden Book of the Jewish National Fund; once in September 1967, in honor of his staunch support for Israel during the Six-Day War and once in January 1974, honoring his passing. His unconditional love, devotion and support for Israel, which stemmed from his biblical faith is, to this day, carried on by the members of the Makuya movement.\n\n"}

{"id": "2269886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269886", "title": "Gender roles in Islam", "text": "Gender roles in Islam\n\nIn Islam, scriptures, cultural traditions, and jurisprudence affect the relationship between men and women.\n\nThe Quran, the holiest book in Islam, indicates that men and women are spiritual equals. The Quran 4:124 states:\n\n\"If any do deeds of righteousness be they male or female and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them.\"\nBut this notion of equality has not been reflected in many of the laws in Muslim-based institutions.\n\nThe Quran does not specify specific gender roles for women. However, in Islamic practice, gender roles manifest themselves, partially because men and women are sometimes allotted different rights and different cultural expectations.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, women are legally restricted from practicing certain rights.\n\nCultural traditions of nonreligious origin impact gender roles, prevailing cultural norms, and the interpretation of the Quran and other Islamic texts.\n\nSome Reformist and feminist scholars have argued that the concept of guardianship has formed the basis of particular gender roles in Muslim societies. Women are often expected to be obedient wives and mothers staying within the family environment and men are expected to be protectors and caretakers of the family. However, the majority of Muslim scholars agree that women are not obligated to serve their husbands or do housework or do any kind of work at home.\n\nAccording to Sayyid Qutb, a prominent member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and 60s, the Quran \"gives the man the right of 'guardianship' or 'superiority' over the family structure in order to prevent dissension and friction between the spouses. The equity of this system lies in the fact that God both favoured the man with the necessary qualities and skills for the 'guardianship' and also charged him with the duty to provide for the structure's upkeep.\" Qutb's ideologies are still impactful today, for radical Islamists, influencing such prominent Middle Eastern leaders as Ayman Zawahiri and terrorist Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe family sphere and the roles in which women and men play therein is an important element in Islamic culture. Gender roles viewed from an Islamic perspective are based on the Qur'an and the stress it places on the importance of the family dynamic As with any socio-cultural group, gender roles vary depending on the conservative or liberal nature of the specific group.\n\nAlthough there are no clearly defined roles for men and women in the Qur'an, it is strongly implied that each gender provides equally significant contributions to the family realm.\n\nIn chapter 4 verse 34 in the Qur'an, it states that \"men are the protectors and maintainers of women\", clearly placing men in a leadership role within the household. As the head of the household, a man is therefore expected to adequately provide for wife and children. It is implied that a noble \"husband’s responsibilities commit him to support his wife and children, provide education for his offspring, be kind and attentive to his spouse, and be good to his affines”. These values have remained rather consistent throughout the history of Islam. It was the husband’s job to protect his wife(s), as it was culturally understood that women do, and should, rely on men. This is viewed not in a restricting reliance but as an arrangement to protect women from the distress and inconveniences of the public arenas. It is because of this ideology that women traditionally do not contribute to the household financially, leaving men to be the sole breadwinners.\n\nThe woman’s role in the home, although different from men, is also of great value and importance in Islamic culture. From a very young age, little girls traditionally grew up in the women’s quarters of the house: the \"harem\". The harem was the part of the house where the female members of the family and the household lived. It was normally out of bounds to all males except the master of the house, his sons and perhaps a physician. Here, young girls are familiarized with domestic activities and were taught Islamic laws and values.\n\nSeveral passages of the Quran deal with acceptable dress for both men and women. Sura 24, Verses 30-31 states:\n\n\"And tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their bosoms, and not to reveal their adornment save to [those relatives who fall within bounds of close relationship explained in the Qur’an]...\" Chapter 24, Verses 30-31.\n\nHowever, there are many different interpretations of what “modesty” requires. The Quran requires Muslim women to dress modestly and to, at the very least, cover their breasts and genitals.\n\nThe law of Hijab, on the other hand, states that the whole female body (not including the face and hands) should be covered, when a woman leaves her home.\n\nFor Friday prayers, by custom, Muslim congregations segregate men, women, and children in separate groups. On other days the women and children pray at home.Men are expected to offer the five daily prayers at the nearest mosque. Muhammad specifically allowed Muslim women to attend mosques and pray behind men. Mohammad said 'Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them.\" which implies it is better for women to stay at home. \"A woman’s prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Baab maa jaa’a fee khurooj al-nisaa’ ilaa’l-masjid. See also Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no. 3833).\n\nWomen are prohibited from praying at a Mosque in Surinam.\n\nSexuality as discussed in Islamic texts is generally confined to the context of heterosexual marriage, and in all cases modesty and chastity are strongly encouraged. Pre-marital sex and homosexuality are forbidden, and abortion is largely discouraged except in cases where there are medical risks for the mother. Sexuality in Islam is often separated in terms of male versus female sexuality, marital versus pre-marital versus extramarital sexuality, and heterosexuality versus homosexuality as is pointed out by Abdessamad Dialmy.\n\nThe Islamic tradition recognizes the sexual desires of both men and women. In many classical arguments, it is the husband's duty to fulfill his wife's sexual needs, which are part of her rights as a married woman. This argument is often paired with the statement that this is how society prevents social unrest (fitna). According to Kecia Ali, \"Classical texts note the importance of female fulfillment, while stressing the wives' duty to remain sexually available to their husbands...whereas contemporary authors, focus on women's sexual rights within their marriages, attempting to prove the importance of female pleasure by highlighting the separation of sex from reproduction and the importance of the female orgasm.\" Classical authors also stress the importance of male guardianship as the required to protect the chastity and modesty of women in their care.\n\nTraditional Islam considers the heterosexual relationship between a man and a woman the only acceptable relationship. Within this traditional relationship, the male is allowed more room for expression of his sexual rights than the female is as mentioned above. There are three types of heterosexual relationships: pre-marital, marital, and extramarital.\n\nPre-Marital Sex: Pre-marital sex is frowned upon in general; however, there are strict regulations on men and women to keep their virginity. Men and women are advised to abstain from indulging in indiscriminate sexual relationship for mere satisfaction of carnal desires. Marriage is the only acceptable means to indulge in sexual relationships, any other is considered as \"Zina\", one of the major sins in Islam. In Islamic marital practices, the male pays a dower for his wife, which is one of the essentials of a {iediedt thid} marriage. Other essentials are the presence of witnesses and 'Waliy' guardian. Muhammad was reported to have said: marriage is not valid without Sadaq, Waliy and Shahidain (Dower, Guardian and Witnesses respectively) The dower is a fixed amount of money or a gift of jewellery or property equivalent to it to the bride as her own. A Muslim marriage is a marriage is there usually solemnized in the mosque before an imam where guardians of both parties appear on their behalf(usually that of the female)and the marriage pronounced after payment of the Sadaq. It is not a contract that needs to be signed by the either of the parties.\n\nMarital Sex: Sex is supposed to be shared between spouses (a man and a woman). Men are technically allowed to take more than one wife, up to four wives as long as he can provide for each wife equally and not differentiate between them in a practice known as polygamy. Polygamy, though technically legal, is not a recommended practice in Islamic culture. Women cannot have multiple husbands. \n\nExtramarital Sex: Sexual affairs outside of marriage are prohibited in Islam, and result in severe punishment for the perpetrating husband or wife, upon rigid proof that they participated in an affair. The proof is given by four male witnesses or eight female witnesses (with clean background histories i.e. known to be pious Muslims), who testify to seeing the act of penetration between the extra-marital couple. Punishment for not being able to provide the required number of witnesses after accusing the defendants is eighty lashes of a whip.\n\nThe couple are given chances to plead for forgiveness to God before the punishment is carried out. If they do not, they will be punished. If both parties are married, they will both be stoned to death. If one is married, while the other is not, the former will be stoned until dead, and the latter will be given a hundred lashes. The severe punishment of an extra-marital are mainly to act as a deterrent to society from engaging in such relationships, as sex outside marriage is a major sin in Islam. The pain of the punishment is also believed to lessen punishment in the afterlife.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these punishments can only take place under a Muslim government implementing Sharia Law, and cannot be handed out in a non-Muslim country with a different legal system.\n\nTraditional Islamic schools of thought as based on the Quran and Hadith consider homosexuality to be a punishable sin. In much of the Islamic world, homosexuality is not legal, and in Afghanistan, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen homosexual acts are punishable by death. Most Muslim countries continue to oppose LGBT rights movements, with the exceptions of Albania, Sierra Leone, and Mozambique. In Albania, Turkey, Bahrain, Jordan, and Mali, homosexual intercourse is legal, and there is some discussion of legalizing same-sex marriage in Albania and Mozambique.\n\nAdditionally, guardianship, gender roles, and male control over women's sexuality are also tools that allow for the enforcement of heterosexual norms.\n\nSurveys have shown a widespread belief, particularly in Mali, Mauritania, Guinea and Egypt, that FGM is a religious requirement. Gruenbaum has argued that practitioners may not distinguish between religion, tradition and chastity, making it difficult to interpret the data. FGM's origins in northeastern Africa are pre-Islamic, but the practice became associated with Islam because of that religion's focus on female chastity and seclusion. There is no mention of it in the Quran. It is praised in a few \"daʻīf\" (weak) \"hadith\" (sayings attributed to Muhammad) as noble but not required, although it is regarded as obligatory by the Shafi'i version of Sunni Islam. In 2007 the Al-Azhar Supreme Council of Islamic Research in Cairo ruled that FGM had \"no basis in core Islamic law or any of its partial provisions\".\n\nAt least some of what is deemed to be masculine in Muslim cultures stems from the life and actions of Muhammad as put down in the Hadith. Muhammad was married to his first wife Khadija monogamously for 25 years. Upon her death he later married a total of fourteen women. In Sahih al-Bukhari 7:62:142, it is said that Muhammad sometimes had sexual relations with all his wives in one night, and in 1:5:268 he is described as having “the strength of thirty men.” This, along with a Muslim practice of measuring a man by the number of his male offspring, suggests that virility is a large traditional component of what has long been deemed \"masculine\" in the Muslim tradition. The idea of traditional masculinity is also strongly shaped by the tradition idea of femininity. Several classic Muslim authors such as Sheikh Muhammad Nefzawi and Ahmed Bin Selman describe women as beings with insatiable sexual appetites. It follows that a man who can satisfy multiple women is seen as incredibly powerful and masculine.\n\nIn addition to the relationship between Muslim masculinity and female sexuality, some concepts of Muslim masculinity stem from the relationships between Muslim men. Prominent writer of \"Islamic Masculinities\", Lahoucine Ouzgane, proposes the idea that masculinity is rooted in a fear of emasculation by other men. Additionally, projecting homosexuality onto another man is often seen as a way to emasculate him while reaffirming one's own superior virility.\n\nViewpoints regarding gender roles vary with different interpretations of the Quran, different sects of the religion, and different cultural and locational regions.\n\nSalafiyyah literally means \"that which pertains to ancestry\". It was first conceived by Muhammad Abduh and refers back to the first generation of Muslims who supported Muhammad during the seventh century. In Arabic it means fundamentalism.\n\nThe ideas of Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah bin Baz are characteristic of much of the salafiyyah sect. Bin Baz believed that the engagement of women in “male domains” separates them from their God-given nature, eventually leading to women's misery and demise. He believed that women entering “male domains” posed a danger to Muslim society, eventually causing it to fall into moral decay. Additionally, he asserted that a woman outside the home was a woman denying her true, God-given character. He viewed the involvement of women in male domains as a detriment to the next generation, which he says may receive a worse education and less compassion from their mothers. BinBaz also thought that women should only work in certain fields—those that are within a woman's domain—such as female education, nursing and medical care. But even these must obey a strict separation of gender.\n\nThe Qur'anic and prophetic terms for \"moderation\" are reflected in the word \"wasatiyyah,\" which means the \"middle way between extremes\" and \"upright without losing balance.\"\n\nMuhammad Al-Ghazali's ideas characterize much of the wasatiyyah school of thought. His ideas are shared by other notable and influential people including Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, Abdel-Haleem AbuShaqua, and Hasan al-Turabi. Together they represent a growing modernist trend. Al-Ghazali indicated that Islam suggest a significant sense of equality between men and women. He maintained that there are traditions created by people and not by God that slow women's development and keeps them in religious ignorance, which he believes results in the degradation of the whole Muslim community. Ghazali asserts that women have been denied a say in their communities and have been restricted to domestic service. He also called for a change in Islamic thinking in general and the reevaluation of cultural traditions that are attributed wrongly as central to the Islamic faith.\n\nIn her writings, Fatema Mernissi remarks that “if women's rights are a problem for some modern Muslim men, it is neither because of the Qur'an nor the Prophet Muhammad, nor the Islamic tradition, but simply because those rights conflict with the interests of a male elite”. She questions the social norm a man is “dishonoured” if a woman in their family works outside of a domestic space. She asserts that in the male mind society is divided into an economically productive section that is public and male and a domestic sphere that is private and female and that these two areas should not mix.\n\nHeba Ra'uf (born 1965) Ra'uf stresses the importance of new interpretations of the Quran and Sunnah (traditions and sayings of Muhammad). Ra'uf argues that the advancement of women's causes in Arab and Muslim societies requires a reworking of Islamic thought. She criticizes the efforts of those who draw their inspiration exclusively from Western feminism.\n\nRa'uf dresses in the Muslim veil. This is a source of controversy within Islamic feminists. On the one hand, some feminists like Nawal El-Saadawi severely criticize the veil: “veiling and nakedness are two sides of the same coin. Both mean women are bodies without mind … ”. But Ra'uf sees wearing a veil as a means of liberation: “the veil neutralizes women's sexuality in the public sphere, making clear that they are citizens – not sexual objects”.\n\nRa'uf acknowledges that women belong in the public sphere, and she challenges any gender-based separation between the public and private spheres. She emphasizes that women's work should extend both into the private and the public sectors. “Breaking the dichotomy would give housewives more social esteem and would encourage working women to fulfill their psychological need to be good mothers and wives” \n\nUntil at least October 2017, women are disallowed to drive in Saudi Arabia, the only country in the world with such a restriction. In some areas such as Mecca they are expected to cover their hair as well. While they have gained increased access to education and a few gender segregated job opportunities, their representation in the labor market rate was barely more than 10 percent in 2002.\n\nWomen's development in Saudi Arabia has been relatively slower than in its neighboring Arab countries, especially regarding the improvement of female participation. In 2004, the fifth Jeddah Economic Forum held in Saudi Arabia had its first ever woman in key activities, with Lubna Olayan delivering the keynote speech. In the same year, the highest religious authority in Saudi Arabia reaffirmed in the 2004 hajj (Muslim pilgrimage) speech that “women should be grateful to the respectful role accorded to them by Islam as mothers”.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has witnessed a number of advancements and setbacks for women's roles in the past 40 years, especially following the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Initially laws were enacted that restricted women's freedom of movement such as a more strict enforcing of veiling and a segregation of the sexes in public space Educational access was restricted and certain political positions and occupations were discouraged or barred to women. Constitutional revisions that occurred in 1989 ultimately resulted in an improvement in the lives and opportunities of women. Several women have been elected to the Iranian parliament, more women take advantage of higher education opportunities, and more women participate in civil service.\n\nDuring the period of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, women were severely limited in employment opportunities. Women who had children were not allowed to work in any way, and other women were encouraged to do work only from home. Women could work in health fields but only to treat female patients. Initially, widows were hard-pressed to find any work, but an edict issued by the Taliban in 1999 allowed widows to work in a severely limited pool of employment opportunities.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Taliban, education and employment opportunities improved. Women could again work as teachers, doctors, and civil servants. The Women Judges Association was established, and advocates female participation in the law and equality for women under the law. Still, women remain underrepresented in education. In 2011, for example, 37% of students in Afghanistan were female, and about 15% of women can read and write. However, literacy is improving with more schools open for girls and a higher attendance rate.\n"}

This record was not tied until 2007 and broken until 2008. He won 11 of 15 starts as a 2 year old and earned $1,180,271.\n\nArtsplace's 3-year old campaign was marred by injuries, though he still earned over $900,000 and won several major stakes races including the Dancer Memorial and American National and finished second in the Meadowlands Pace as he battled it out with Die Laughing and Precious Bunny, the latter of whom went on to garner horse of the year honors. He won 10 of 15 starts and $972,487 in 1991.\n\nArtsplace's connections decided to return the horse to the races at age 4. Fully healthy, Artsplace had arguably the greatest season in harness racing history, going undefeated and winning such races as the Breeders Crown, US Pacing Championship, and American National, among many others. Driven throughout his career by Hall of Famer John Campbell, Artsplace paced a mile in 1:49 2/5, which was at the time the fastest race mile in harness racing history. He also won the final of the Driscoll Series at The Meadowlands. In his Harness Horse of the Year season of 1992 he was undefeated in 16 starts and won $932,325. Artsplace entered the breeding shed with a lifetime summary of 49 37-7-1 ($3,085,083), retired as the second-richest pacer of all time, and set at least one world record in each of his three years of competition.\n\nIn a poll by harness racing experts commissioned by the U.S. Trotting Association, Artsplace was voted the 10th-greatest harness horse in history. The fans voted him the 12th-greatest.\n\nAt stud, Artsplace was a producer of top horses from the time his first crop raced in 1996. He regularly dominated the breeding statistics for several years, with his progeny earning $173 million including 18 having earned at least $1 million by the time of his election to the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. Artsplace sired numerous champion horses, including millionaires Artiscape, Art Major, Worldly Beauty, Galleria, Grinfromeartoear, Art's Conquest, Astreos, Arturo and Glowing Report, among many others. He was the leading sire in North America six times. Many of Artsplace's sons and daughters have gone on to sire champions themselves, including most recently Art Major, who sired 2008 Meadowlands Pace champion Art Official, winner of the 2008 Pace in 1:47 which was, at the time, a world record time for 3 year old pacers and the second fastest race mile in harness racing history.\n\nArtsplace was euthanized at the age of 18 in 2006 due to complications of laminitis, which he had been suffering with for some time.\n"}

He served as Bishop of Lincoln (1924–30) and as Archbishop of Dubuque (1930–46).\n\nFrancis Beckman was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Francis and Elizabeth (née Fenker) Beckman. He studied at St. Gregory's Preparatory Seminary and Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Cincinnati, at the University of Louvain in Belgium, and at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 20, 1902. Following his ordination, he received a Licentiate of Sacred Theology (1907) and later a Doctor of Sacred Theology (1908) from the Gregorian.\n\nAfter his return to Cincinnati, Beckman joined the faculty of Mount St. Mary's Seminary, where he served as professor of philosophy and dogmatic theology (1908–12). He was rector of Mount St. Mary's from 1912 to 1924. He also served as \"Censor Librorum\" and a consultor for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.\n\nOn December 23, 1923, Beckman was appointed the fourth Bishop of Lincoln, Nebraska, by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on May 1, 1924 from Archbishop Henry Moeller of Cincinnati. Bishops Joseph Schrembs of Cleveland and Joseph Chartrand of Indianapolis were the principal co-consecrators. He served the diocese for almost six years. During his time in Lincoln he served as apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Omaha from June 1926 – July 1928.\n\nPope Pius XI appointed Bishop Beckman Archbishop of Dubuque on January 17, 1930. Beckman shepherded the church through the Great Depression and World War II. During his tenure as archbishop the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Holy Name Societies, National Catholic Rural Life Conference, Conference on Industrial Relations, and the Catholic Youth Organization grew with his support. The Catholic Student's Mission Crusade, which he founded while in Cincinnati, held its 1935 convention in Dubuque. In 1939 the archdiocese's Columbia College in Dubuque was renamed Loras College in honor of Dubuque's first bishop, Mathias Loras.\n\nBeckman began a campaign against swing music in 1938. He made headlines when he spoke before the National Council of Catholic Women in October and openly denounced it as \"a degenerated musical system... turned loose to gnaw away the moral fiber of young people\" which would lead one down \"primrose path to Hell.\"\n\nBeckman adopted a pacifist stance in the years before World War II. He wrote an open letter to Senator William Borah of Idaho encouraging him in his efforts to maintain American neutrality. At a rally on October 20, 1939, Beckman supported noted radio priest Father Charles Coughlin in his stand for peace. The next week he went on the radio with Coughlin and said that the Communists wanted the U.S. to enter the war so that worn out by the war, it would be more susceptible to communist thought. He made numerous speeches against U.S. involvement in the war until Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese.\n\nImpressed with Catholic culture he had seen in Europe, Beckman began to collect fine art pieces starting with a small collection of artifacts belonging to Father William Kessler at Columbia Academy in Dubuque. He had placed a number of art pieces in a museum that was created at Columbia (now Loras) College with the assistance of the Midwest Antiquarian Association. This collection had included works of some of the best artists over the past few centuries including Winslow Horner, Rembrandt, Rubens, and Van Dyck. The collection was estimated to be worth 1.5 million dollars.\n\nIn 1936 Archbishop Beckman was introduced to the idea of investing borrowed money in gold mines by Phillip Suetter of California. He perhaps thought that he could gain funds to further his art collection. Instead Beckman had involved the archdiocese in what turned out to be a dubious gold mine scheme. Beckman signed promissory notes on behalf of the archdiocese, which caused financial problems for the archdiocese when the scheme fell apart and Suetter was arrested. President Franklin Roosevelt directed the FBI to investigate Beckman to determine the extent of his involvement in this financial scheme, not because of Beckman's opposition to the president as some believed. Soon the holders of the notes began demanding repayment. Most of Beckman's collection was sold to pay off the notes. The cost to the archdiocese was over half a million dollars.\n\nAs a result of all of Beckman's problems, Bishop Henry Rohlman of Davenport was transferred to Dubuque to serve as coadjutor archbishop and apostolic administrator. Beckman was allowed to retain his title as Archbishop of Dubuque, but it was made clear to him that actual authority rested with Rohlman.\n\nArchbishop Beckman remained Archbishop of Dubuque until Pope Pius XII named him Titular Archbishop of Phulli and he retired on November 11, 1946. Following retirement, Beckman left Dubuque and moved to Cincinnati.\n\nBeckman died at the Alexian Brothers Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, at age 72. He was buried in the mortuary chapel of Saint Raphael's Cathedral in Dubuque.\n"}

It is funded primarily by the German Foreign Office\n\nAngkor Wat is the principal monument of the Angkor World Heritage Site in Cambodia which was registered in the World Heritage List in 1992. Despite its condition it is currently not inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger. On a national level it is under the administration of the / APSARA Authority and the G.A.C.P. (German Apsara Conservation Project) works in collaboration with both UNESCO and APSARA Authority towards the conservation of this unique monument.\n\nAngkor Wat is generally considered to be the largest religious stone monument in the world and much of the surface of this extraordinary temple is decorated with carvings in bas-relief of battle scenes, of triumphant processions, of religious scenes and of single or groups of female figures. Nearly 1,850 of these female figures, popularly known as Apsaras, adorn the surface of Angkor Wat and some of them are in an extremely alarming state of decay. Several of the reliefs have already fallen victim to the ravages of time.\n\nNatural stones weather in different ways. Scientific investigations have been under way since 1995 to examine the characteristic properties of the sandstone and the factors causing damage. The conservators are being supported by photographers and experts from the fields of geology, geomicrobiology and chemistry. The detailed investigations have confirmed that, in the case of some 360 of the Apsaras, the damage is so serious that significant quantities of carved stone surface could become detached at any time. The project chose to focus on the Apsaras since they are the most exposed and therefore endangered of the precious carvings at Angkor Wat.\n\nSince 1997 the work of conservation is being performed by students and lecturers of the Department of Restoration and Conservation of the Fachhochschule Köln (University of Applied Sciences, Cologne) and by local Conservation d’Angkor personnel in collaboration with the APSARA Authority. The first urgent measure performed was a reversible step to secure the endangered relief areas. A team from Fachhochschule Köln (University of Applied Sciences Cologne) has set itself the goal of reducing the erosion of the Apsaras. Conservation work is now being carried out using material with properties similar to those of the original stone. Ultimately, it will not be possible to completely stop the damage to the reliefs, which means that regular and sound maintenance of the monument is the most effective conservation measure.\n\nOne of the most important activities of the German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is education and training of qualified staff for the future conservation of Angkor. Students of restoration and conservation at the University of Applied Sciences Cologne join the project either to make their diploma thesis on subjects significant for the conservation of the reliefs or to pass the “practice semester” that is a part of their education. Meanwhile, the GACP co-operates closely with the Royal University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh, Faculty of Archaeology, Architecture and Urbanism and Plastic Arts. The students from Phnom Penh participate in courses of stone conservation and some of them have written their diploma theses with the joint supervision of the Royal University of Fine Arts and the GACP consultants. The GACP experts have also trained the team of Cambodian conservators working at the temple throughout the year. In the year 2000 new trainees for stone conservation will be recruited by the GACP.\n\nThere are a multitude of temples within the Angkor region and consequently there are many international groups working in the field of restoration and conservation. This community of international projects makes up the world’s biggest preservation project co-ordinated by UNESCO. Exchange of experiences, transfer of technology, consultation and collaboration with the national and international institutions present is therefore an important aim of the GACP.\n\nWhen the University of Applied Sciences Cologne began to assess and evaluate the situation at Angkor in 1995, with a view of preparing a conservation project, it was immediately clear that the documentation of the surfaces and subsequently of the intervention would have to be approached in an exceptional way.\n\n"}

He attended the University of California, Los Angeles but dropped out when he was not admitted into the film school in his third year. As an unpaid intern for a Hollywood agent, he gained attention for a screenplay he wrote called \"Swings\". This led to a meeting where he successfully pitched \"Racing with the Moon\" (1984).\n\nHis first experience with professional screenwriting left him wanting more interaction with the actors so that the characters would stay true to his vision. Kloves wrote \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" and also intended it to be his directorial debut. After years of trying to sell the project in Hollywood, the film finally got off the ground and was released in 1989. \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" did reasonably well and was critically acclaimed, but his next shot as writer/director for \"Flesh and Bone\" in 1993 fared poorly at the box office. Kloves then stopped writing for three years.\n\nRealizing that he had to return to writing to support his family, he began adapting Michael Chabon's novel \"Wonder Boys\" into a screenplay. Kloves was offered the chance to direct but he declined, preferring to direct only his own original work. This was his first try at adapting another work to film. His screenplay was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award after the film's release in 2000.\n\nWarner Bros. sent Kloves a list of novels that the company was considering to adapt as films. The listing included the first \"Harry Potter\" novel, which intrigued him despite his usual indifference to these catalogs. He went on to write the screenplays for the first four films in the series. However, he turned down writing the fifth film, stating that \"The fourth film, \"Goblet of Fire\", was really hard to do. I wrote on it for two years. But it’s not that simple and I don't know that I'll ever fully understand why I didn't do it.\" After Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay for the fifth film, Kloves then returned to write the sixth, seventh and eighth installments.\n\nIn 2011, Kloves was attached to work on a film adaptation of Mark Haddon's novel \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\".

Though he died at an early age he managed to make several hundred photographs in just over a dozen years featuring a wide range of subject matter including architecture, landscapes, and studio, ethnographic and genre portraits.\n\nGsell was born in Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, Haut-Rhin, France on 31 December 1838. He served in the military from 1858 to 1866, during which time he learned photography and travelled to Cochin China (now Southern Vietnam).\n\nIn Cochin China, Gsell was hired by the \"Commission d'exploration du Mékong\", directed by Ernest Doudart de Lagrée (b. 1823 - d. 1868), to photograph the ruins of Angkor.

{"id": "2269971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269971", "title": "Junayd of Baghdad", "text": "Junayd of Baghdad\n\nJunaid of Baghdad (835–910) was a Persian mystic and one of the most famous of the early Saints of Islam. He is a central figure in the spiritual lineage of many Sufi orders.\n\nJunaid taught in Baghdad throughout his lifetime and was an important figure in the development of Sufi doctrine. i, like Hasan of Basra before him, was widely revered by his students and disciples as well as quoted by other mystics. Because of his importance in Sufi theology, Junaid was often referred to as the \"Sultan\".\n\nThe exact birth date of Abu-l-Qāsim al-Junaid ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Junaid al-Khazzāz al-Qawārīrī (Arabic: أبو القاسم الجنيد بن محمد الخزاز القواريري) is disputed and ranges from 210 to 215 AH according to Abdel-Kader. His death is more certain and ranges from 296 to 298 AH (908 to 910 CE). It is believed that al-Junaid was of Persian ancestry, with his ancestors originating in Nihawand in modern-day Iran. Al-Junaid was raised by his uncle Sirri Saqti after being orphaned as a boy. Al-Junaid's early education included teachings from Abū Thawr, Abū 'Ubayd, al-Ḥārith al-Muḥãsibī, and Sarī ibn Mughallas.\n\nAs to the hagiography by Attar of Nishapur, the \"Tazkirat al-Awliya\", iad felt the pain of divine separation since childhood. Regardless of spiritual sorrow, he was known for his quick understanding and discipline. When Sirri Saqti accepted him.\nAccording to Attar, Junaid was only seven years of age when Sirri Saqti took him along for the Hajj. In al-Masjid an-Nabawi, there were 400 sheikhs discussing the concept of ‘thankfulness’ whereby each expounded his own view. When Sirri Saqti told him to present his definition, Junaid said, \"Thankfulness means that should not disobey God by means of the favour which he has bestowed upon you nor make of His favour a source of disobedience.\" The sheikhs unanimously agreed that no other words could define the term better. Sirri Saqti asked Junaid from where he learn all this. Junaid replied, \"From sitting with you.\"\n\nHis traditional hagiography continues by stating that Junayd went back to Baghdad and took up selling glasses. However, he spent most of the time in prayer. Hence, he retired to the porch of Sirri Saqti's house and kept himself away from worldly matters devoting his thoughts only to God. People need to \"relinquish natural desires, to wipe out human attributes, to discard selfish motives, to cultivate spiritual qualities, to devote oneself to true knowledge, to do what is best in the context of eternity, to wish good for the entire community, to be truly faithful to God, and to follow the Prophet in the matters of the Shari’a.\" This starts with the practice of asceticism (\"zuhd\") and continues with withdrawal from society, intensive concentration on devotion (ibadah) and remembrance (dhikr) of God, sincerity (\"ikhlas\"), and contemplation (\"muraqaba\") respectively; contemplation produces fana.\n\nJunayd spend 40 years in his mystic course praying while sacrificing his sleep and any other worldly desires but then a conceit in his heart arose that he has achieved his goal. By then he inspired by God that \"He who is not worthy of union, all his good works are but sins.\" This meant that the prayers which become a source of pride are useless as true prayer makes a person more humble and devoted to God. His name became famous in many parts of the world despite the persecution he faced and the tongues of slander shot at him. Even then, he did not start preaching until 30 of the great saints indicated to him that he should now call men to God. However, he chose not to preach as yet saying, \"While the master is there, it is not seemingly for the disciple to preach.\" After witnessing Muhammad in his dream commanding him to preach, he had to listen to Sirri Saqti. The intensity of ishq poured out of speech of Junayd such that out of the 40 people he first preached, 18 died and 22 fainted. His caliph and most dear disciple was Abu Bakr Shibli.\n\niaid helped establish the \"sober\" school of Sufi thought, which meant that he was very logical and scholarly about his definitions of various virtues, tawhid, etc. Sober Sufism is characterized by people who \"experience \"fana\" [and] do not subsist in that state of selfless absorption in God but find themselves returned to their senses by God. Such returnees from the experience of selflessness are thus reconstituted as renewed selves,\" just like an intoxicated person sobering up. For example, Junaid is quoted as saying, \"The water takes on the color of the cup.\" While this might seem rather confusing at first, ‘Abd al-Hakeem Carney explains it best: \"When the water is understood here to refer to the Light of Divine self-disclosure, we are led to the important concept of 'capacity,' whereby the Divine epiphany is received by the heart of any person according to that person’s particular receptive capacity and will be 'colored' by that person’s nature\".\n\nAlso, according to Sells, \"Junaid seems to presuppose that his hearer or reader has had the experience about which he is speaking – or, even more radically, that the hearer or reader is able to enter that experience, or some re-creation of it – at the moment of encounter with Junaid's words.\" This statement makes it seem like Junaid was writing to a specific sect of the elite that he described earlier. The elite that he refers to are the elect, or \"a tightly-knit group of 'brethren' that Junaid designates by such phrases as 'the choice of believers' or 'the pure ones'. They play significant roles in the community of believers.\"\n\nAs mentioned, Junaid has always been difficult to read for scholars because most of his writings have been lost to time. Junaid constantly uses precise words and language specific to try and describe God, the longing for Him, and the human condition. His ornate language immediately turns off most people, but Junaid had a reason for writing so cryptically. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Islam\", Junaid found out that a letter he had written was opened by a stranger before it got to its destination: “doubtless by some zealot desirous of finding cause for impugning his orthodoxy; and to this ever-present danger must in part be attributed the deliberate preciosity which marks the writings of all the mystics of J̲unaid's period”. This constant worry about others getting a hold of his ideas caused Junaid to become very protective of his writings.\n\n\n"}

This development came at a time when other victorious Allies of World War II and much of the rest of the world remained hostile (for the 1946 United Nations condemnation of the Francoist regime, see \"Spanish Question\") to a fascist regime sympathetic to the cause of the Axis powers and established with the Axis assistance. The 1953 accord took the form of three separate executive agreements that pledged the United States to furnish economic and military aid to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory (Naval Station Rota, Morón Air Base, Torrejón Air Base and Zaragoza Air Base).\n\nAlthough not a full-fledged military alliance, the pact did result in a substantial United States contribution to the improvement of Spain's defense capabilities. During the initial United States fiscal years 1954 to 1961 phase, military aid amounted to US$500 million, in the form of grants. Between 1962 and 1982, a further US$1.238 billion of aid in the form of loans (US$727 million) and grants (US$511 million) was provided. During the period 1983 to 1986, United States military aid, entirely in the form of sales under concessional credit terms, averaged US$400 million annually, but it declined to slightly more than US$100 million annually in 1987 and in 1988. The military credits were scheduled to be phased out in the fiscal year 1989, in keeping with Spain's growing self-sufficiency in national defense. More than 200 officers and NCOs of the Spanish Armed Forces received specialized training in the United States each year under a parallel program.\n\n"}
{"id": "2269992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269992", "title": "Cinema of Portugal", "text": "Cinema of Portugal\n\nThe Cinema of Portugal started with the birth of the medium in the late 19th century. Cinema was introduced in Portugal in 1896 with the screening of foreign films and the first Portuguese film was \"Saída do Pessoal Operário da Fábrica Confiança\", made in the same year. The first movie theater opened in 1904 and the first scripted Portuguese film was \"O Rapto de Uma Actriz\" (1907). The first all-talking sound film, \"A Severa\", was made in 1931. Starting in 1933, with \"A Canção de Lisboa\", the Golden Age would last the next two decades, with films such as \"O Pátio das Cantigas\" (1942) and \"A Menina da Rádio\" (1944). \"Aniki-Bóbó\" (1942), Manoel de Oliveira's first feature film, marked a milestone, with a realist style predating Italian neorealism by a few years. In the 1950s the industry stagnated. The early 1960s saw the birth of the \"Cinema Novo\" (literally \"New Cinema\") movement, showing realism in film, in the vein of Italian neorealism and the French New Wave, with films like \"Dom Roberto\" (1962) and \"Os Verdes Anos\" (1963). The movement became particularly relevant after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. In 1989, João César Monteiro's \"Recordações da Casa Amarela\" won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival and in 2009, João Salaviza's \"Arena\" won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Several other Portuguese films have been in competition for major film awards like the Palme d'Or and the Golden Bear. \"João Sete Sete\" (2006) was the first Portuguese animated feature film. Portuguese cinema is significantly supported by the State, with the government's Instituto do Cinema e do Audiovisual giving films financial support.\n\nPortuguese film history began on 18 June 1896, at the Real Colyseu da Rua da Palma nº 288, in Lisbon, when Edwin Rousby presented Robert William Paul's Animatograph, using a Teatrograph projector. This places the debut of film in Portugal around six months after the Lumière brothers' inaugural presentation in Paris.\n\nThe Portuguese audience was familiar with photographic projection, first from cycloramas, dioramas and stereoscopic views and, later, from the magic lantern, with the projection of transparent photographs through a glass plate then coloured. On 28 December 1894, the German photographer Carlos Eisenlohr opened his \"Imperial Exhibition\" at the galleries of the Avenida Palace Hotel. He presented a novelty to this already knowledgeable Lisbon audience: the live photograph – shown not through an Edison Kinetograph, as announced at the time, but by the Elektrotachyscop or Schnellseher, also called the Electro-Tachiscópio Eisenlohr, an invention by Ottomar Anschutz. The device projected images of actions, of a dog passing by or the galloping of a horse, contained in small disks that produced moving images of extremely short periods.\n\nIn the beginning of 1895, the tobacco shop Tabacaria Neves presented Edison's Kinetoscope (in fact, a copy of said invention, built in London by Robert William Paul, ordered by the Greek George Georgiades, who presented the machine in Lisbon). Unlike preceding inventions, the Kinestoscope allowed individual viewing and a film made up of 1,380 photographs enabling a 20-second projection of 20 seconds.\n\nThe machine that was used for movies at the Real Colyseu was not the Lumiére brothers' Cinematograph, but a competitor, the Theatrograph, by Robert W. Paul. The machine projected behind the screen, allowing life-size images to appear for about a minute. The first presentation of it was well-received and in the following months, many of the same machines swirled in the cinemas of Lisbon, vying for the favour of movie audiences.\n\nAt the Real Colyseu of the Rua da Palma of António Santos Júnior, on 18 June 1896, Edwin Rousby showed films by Robert William Paul's production house, for whom Rousby worked. About a minute in length each, these \"animated views\" were shot by operators who worked for the British producer: \"Parisian balls\", \"The Pont Neuf in Paris\", \"The Train\", \"The Serpentine Dance\", \"A Barber and Shoeshine Store in Washington\".\n\nRousby then met Manuel Maria da Costa Veiga, a photographer with electrical and mechanical skills, who assisted him in preparing his sessions. Costa Veiga himself began acting as an exhibitor, acquiring a projectoscope from Edison that same year and showing films in Lisbon venues.\n\nRobert W. Paul also sent his operator Henry Short to southern Europe, to record the animated views of landscapes for use by the English producing house. Short passed through Portugal, registering several views that, although destined to be shown in London, would be integrated into Rousby's program at his Portuguese sessions in 1897.\n\nHis success is overwhelming, and he prolonged his stays in Portugal and increased the sessions. However, when Rousby proceeded with his tour to the Teatro-Circo Príncipe Real, in Oporto, the animated photograph also gained a professional who would go on to found Portuguese cinema: Aurélio da Paz dos Reis. \nFrom July to August, Rousby presented his films at the Teatro do Príncipe Real (now the Teatro Sá da Bandeira), without achieving, however, the level of success in Lisbon.\n\nThree years after beginning his exhibition business, Costa Veiga purchased a movie camera and made first film, \"Aspectos da Praia de Cascais\" (\"Views of the Cascais beach\"), with images of King D. Carlos bathing in Cascais. He began recording official visits and other relevant national political events. He founded the first Portuguese production house, Portugal Film, headquartered close to his home in Algés.\n\nIn 1909, Portugália Film, made up of João Freire Correia and Manuel Cardoso, was established in Lisbon, financed by D. Nuno de Almada, and the \"Empresa Cinematográfica Ideal,\" Júlio Costa. Freire Correia, a photographer, bought a projector for the opening of the Salão Ideal ao Loreto in 1904, the first Portuguese cinema. He founded his production company five years later, for which he'd make several films, including \"Batalha de Flores\" (\"Battle of Flowers\") that garnered vast success. He was also the cinematographer of \"O Rapto de Uma Actriz \"(\"The kidnapping of an Actress\")\",\" the first scripted Portuguese film, directed by Lino Ferreira in 1907.\n\nFreire Correia directed two documentaries of significant success in 1909: \"A Cavalaria Portuguesa\" (\"The Portuguese Cavalry\") and the \"O Terramoto de Benavente\" (\"The Earthquake of Benavente\"). The first already showed some technique of image capturing, displaying the prowess of Portuguese cavalry in such a way to create a sense of danger, however fictitious, to the audience. The earthquake was filmed in April, and shown two days later – a remarkable speed – and 22 copies were exported abroad. He would also be responsible for the production of two versions of \"Os Crimes de Diogo Alves\" (\"The Crimes of Diogo Alves\"), whose direction he entrusted first to Lino Ferreira in 1909 but that remained incomplete, and a second with João Tavares directing one in 1911.\n\nEarly notable attempts at sound films include the incomplete \"Grisette\" (1908) directed by Freire Correia used adaptations of the Gaumont method by which he attempted to synchronise image and sound. Portugália also produced the first film adaptation of a literary work: \"Carlota Ângela\" was based in the work of the same name by Camilo Castelo Branco and was directed by João Tavares, in 1912.\n\nJúlio Costa, partnering with João Almeida, acquired the Salão Ideal from Freire Correia and Nuno Almada in 1908 and started the Empresa Cinematográfica Ideal production and distribution house. Remodelled and appropriately refitted, the Salão Ideal presented a predecessor of the talkies, the \"Animatógrafo Falado\" (Spoken Animatograph), where a group of people read the script and produced sound in synch with the film's projection. The group was made up of volunteer firefighters of Ajuda, of which not only Júlio Costa but also António Silva, the actor of the Portuguese Golden Age comedies, were members.\n\nWhile waiting for the construction of his studio at Rua Marquês Ponte de Lima, Júlio Costa began filming \"views\". He begins filming features with \"Chantecler Atraiçoado\" (\"Chantecler Betrayed\") and then with \"Rainha depois de Morta\" (\"Queen After Dead\"), by Carlos Santos, the first Portuguese film with a historic motif. Júlio Costa's company pioneered grouping, production, distribution and exhibition, together for the first time. The company would halt activity after a suspicious fire.\n\nIn 1918, Lusitânia Film was founded, a production company with an ambitious outlook, led by Celestino Soares and Luís Reis Santos. They remodelled the old Portugália Film studio, in São Bento, and began filming documentaries. The same year, two short films are made outdoors by Costa Veigam, directed by the young Leitão de Barros: \"Malmequer\" (\"Daisy\") and \"Mal de Espanha\" (\"Evil From Spain\"). The shooting of \"O Homem dos Olhos Tortos\" (\"The Man with the Twisted Eyes\") began, the story based on a Reinaldo Ferreira police serial and directed by Leitão de Barros. However, due to financial pressures, the film was never completed. A well-organized conspiracy would close down the company that intended to film \"A Severa\" as its next production.\n\nAfter the closing of the \"cycle of Lisbon\", the first Oporto production house was founded, which ensured for some years the continuous production of cinema in the country.\n\nAfter founding a production company bearing his name in 1910, the Oporto exhibitor Nunes de Mattos, added Invicta Film to its corporate name two years later. The company filmed current events and documentaries, among them \"O Naufrágio do Silurian\" (\"The Sinking of the Silurian\"), of which 108 copies were shipped to Europe. In November 1917, de Mattos founded the second \"Invicta Film, Lda\", increasing the number of partners and equity. Henrique Alegria took over art direction and they acquired the Quinta da Prelada, in Oporto, where the studios and laboratories of the producer were built.\n\nIn 1918 they left for Paris, and brought back a technical team from the Pathé studios led by Georges Pallu, a director who would author virtually all the feature films of the Oporto producing house. Also in the team were André Lecointe, architect-decorator; Albert Durot, camera operator and Georges and Valentine Coutable – the couple who would be, respectively, the chief lab and chief editor. Durot would later be replaced by Maurice Laumann, also from Pathé.\n\nFor six years, Invicta Film produced several films and documentaries, enriching the Portuguese film landscape. In 1924, however, the company experienced severe financial distress, leading to the laying off all its personnel and continuing only lab work. They shut down in 1928.\n\nRino Lupo, another milestone of cinematography, showed up on the scene through Pallu, who approved his direction of \"Mulheres da Beira\" (\"Women from Beira\"), after a tale by Abel Botelho, with photography by Artur Costa de Macedo. Though the financial disagreements and the unfulfilment of deadlines forced his removal from the company, Lupo still directed \"Os Lobos\" (\"The Wolves\"), another pearl of the Portuguese silent cinema. He directed others, but without the quality of his earlier works.\n\nThree other companies are set up in the '20s to fill in the studios gap: Caldevilla Film, Fortuna Film and Pátria Film. These also follow the Portuguese pattern, hiring foreign technicians for their experience in Portuguese productions. Although the directors brought from French production houses were presented as recognised stars in their countries, in fact, they often built their careers without having the claimed background.\n\nRaul de Caldevilla founded in 1920 his Caldevilla Film, placing production in Lisbon, at Quinta das Conchas, in Lumiar. Frenchman Maurice Mariaud was the director chosen for the works \"Os Faroleiros\" (\"The Lighthouse Men\") and \"As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor\" (\"The Wards of the Dean\"), for the studio's only two productions. The company would shut down due to an acute financial disagreement among its partners.\n\nVirgínia de Castro e Almeida, a children's book writer, founded in Lisbon the studio Fortuna Film, and hires a French lawyer, Roger Lion, to direct productions based upon her books. Lion brought along his wife, actress Gil-Clary, Maxudian, and the cameramen Daniel Quintin and Marcel Bizot, and they shoot \"A Sereia de Pedra\" (\"The Stone Mermaid\") and \"Olhos da Alma\" (\"Eyes of the Soul\"), the latter shot in Nazaré, in what was its first screen register.\n\nHenrique Alegria left Invicta Film in 1922, to found Pátria Film with Raul Lopes Freire. They bought Quinta das Conchas, where Maurice Mariaud directs \"O Fado\". This company too would cease to operate after shooting \"Aventuras de Agapito – Fotografia Comprometedora\" (\"Adventures of Agapito – Compromising Photograph\"), the fourth film directed by Roger Lion in Portugal.\n\nAt the end of the twenties, the \"young Turks\" begin the era of the cinema estates, with the return of Leitão de Barros and the emergence of young António Lopes Ribeiro (who would soon launch Manoel de Oliveira), Jorge Brum do Canto, Chianca de Garcia and Arthur Duarte. Their agenda was to move away from the previous productions, taking inspiration in the aesthetic designs of the French, German and Russian cinemas. Casts also follow this move, bringing to the screen the stars of the Revista, in contrast to the theatre world. Stars such as Eduardo Brazão, Brunilde Júdice, António Pinheiro or Pato Moniz fade, and a new school emerges with the presence of Vasco Santana, António Silva, Maria Matos, Ribeirinho or Maria Olguim.\n\nAt the same time, the state's relationship with cinema was also to change from the end of the '20s. The installed powers understood these young people dominated the cinema press and influenced the masses with their perspectives and wisely viewed the industry as a privileged means of propaganda for their new regime.\n\nAntónio Lopes Ribeiro launched his career benefiting from the 100 meters law. He films \"Uma Batida em Malpique\" (\"A huntin Malpique\") and \"Bailando ao Sol\" (\"Dancing in the Sun\") (1928), the latter with photography by Aníbal Contreiras. He later departed with Leitão de Barros in a visit to the main European studios, where he'll meet Dziga Vertov and Eiseinstein.\n\nDe Barros, who screened at Lopes Ribeiro's home the 9,5 mm film he had made with his brother-in-law in Nazaré, was spurred by the trip and returned to filming with \"Nazaré, Praia de Pescadores\" (\"Nazaré, Beach of Fishermen\"). Again in Nazaré, de Barros films \"Maria do Mar\" (\"Mary of the Sea\"), the second ethnofiction in cinema history, and a milestone for up until then bleak Portuguese cinematography aesthetics. He also directed \"Lisboa, Crónica Anedótica\" (\"Lisbon, an Anecdotal Chronicle\") (1929), where in a series of multiple city scenes, he displays Chaby Pinheiro, repeat stars Adelina Abranches and Alves da Cunha, Nascimento Fernandes, and the unforgettable Vasco Santana and Beatriz Costa.\n\nInspired by Marcel l'Herbier, Jorge Brum do Canto opened with \"A Dança dos Paroxismos\" (\"The Dance of the Paroxisms\") in 1928, playing the main role with his own script. It opened only to a private audience in 1930, however, to only be seen again in 1984.\n\nManoel de Oliveira shot \"Douro, Faina Fluvial\" (\"Douro, River Works\"), with Lopes Ribeiro persuading him to take it to the V International Critics Congress, where it received the praise of Pirandello. But again it will be Leitão de Barros who leaves an imprint in movie history, with \"A Severa\", based upon the work by Júlio Dantas, with the direction of the first Portuguese talkie. A new era of Portuguese cinema was about to begin.\n\nWith the beginning of the Estado Novo right-wing dictatorship in 1933, a new genre of film started, based on the comedy and musical genres, famously the \"A Comédia À Portuguesa\", with the focus on contemporary life and light matters, and the intention of taking the minds of the people from the difficult times faced.\n\n1942 saw the release of \"Aniki-Bóbó\", the first full-length fictional film from Manoel de Oliveira, who would only return to fiction film-making twenty-one years later. It marked a milestone in Portuguese film not only because it differed from the tone most in vogue at the time, as it dealt with social issues, but also because it predated the first Italian neo-realism movies by a few years.\n\nThe Golden Age, as it is known, began that same year with the release of \"A Canção de Lisboa\", and dominated the country for the next two decades. Other famous titles from this popular era are \"Aldeia da Roupa Branca\" (1938), \"O Pátio das Cantigas\" and \"O Pai Tirano\" (1941), \"O Costa do Castelo\" (1943), \"A Menina da Rádio\" (1944) and \"O Leão da Estrela\" (1947).\n\nDuring this period historic films also emerged as an important genre in the Portuguese industry, as a medium for the state party to develop its nationalist propaganda and conservative values, namely \"As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor\" (1935), \"Bocage\" (1936), \"Amor de Perdição\" (1943), \"Inês de Castro\" (1945), \"Camões\" (1946) and \"Frei Luís de Sousa\" (1950). A subgenre of these nationalist films were those related to the culture of Fado and the rise to popularity of Amália Rodrigues, the great name of \"Portuguese song\". Some of those films were \"Capas Negras\" and \"Fado, História de Uma Cantadeira\", both from 1947.\n\n\"Camões\", directed by José Leitão de Barros, was an official selection at the first Cannes Film Festival in 1946.\n\nThe Fifties were mainly years of stagnation with the continuity of the same movies made in the earlier decades, government censorship and glorification of the colonial empire – see \"Chaimite\" (1953); although the first signs of the winds to come were being given by films like \"Saltimbancos\" (1951) and \"Nazaré\" (1952), both directed by Manuel Guimarães and inspired by the Italian neo-realism.\n\nIn 1958 opens the Portuguese Cinematheque with a retrospective of American movies that inspired the French filmmakers of the Nouvelle Vague, an event lauded by then new critics Alberto Seixas Santos e António Pedro Vasconcelos.\n\nIn 1959 \"Portuguese Rhapsody\", directed by João Mendes, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe new decade brought a new generation of films, led by \"Dom Roberto\" (1962), \"Os Verdes Anos\" and \"Pássaros de Asas Cortadas\" (1963). The new phase was named Cinema Novo or Novo Cinema (New Cinema), and it refers to Portuguese cinema made between 1963 and the revolution in 1974 by directors such as Fernando Lopes, Paulo Rocha or António da Cunha Telles, amongst others. Like other new waves of the period, the influence of Italian Neo-Realism and the burgeoning ideas of the Nouvelle Vague could be felt keenly.\n\nThe term \"Novo Cinema\" is now used to avoid confusion with the Brazilian movement of the same name. This movement gains particular relevance after the Carnation Revolution, pursuing certain experiences of the French New Wave, both in the field of visual anthropology and of political cinema. The generation of the seventies, taking advantage of the new liberties, explores realism and legend, politics and ethnography, until the late eighties, in conjunction with some directors of the liberated colonies, such as Flora Gomes. Portugal has a notable tradition in the field of docufiction and ethnofiction since Leitão de Barros, who was a contemporary of Robert Flaherty.\n\nFilms during this period also include \"Belarmino\" (1964), \"Domingo à Tarde\" (1965), \"Sete balas para Selma\" (1967) and \"O Cerco\" (1969). In 1973 \"The Vows\", directed by António de Macedo, was in competition for the Grand Prix at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"A Ilha dos Amores\", directed by Paulo Rocha, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Other accolades from this period include, in 1985 Manoel de Oliveira winning an Honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival; \"O Bobo\", directed by José Álvaro Morais, winning the Golden Leopard at the 1987 Locarno International Film Festival; \"The Cannibals\", directed by de Oliveira, in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival; and in 1989 \"Recordações da Casa Amarela\", directed by João César Monteiro, winning the Silver Lion at the 46th Venice International Film Festival.\n\nIn 1994 Maria de Medeiros won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 51st Venice International Film Festival for her work in \"Três Irmãos\", directed by Teresa Villaverde. \"The Convent\", directed by Manoel de Oliveira, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. \"Po di Sangui\", directed by Flora Gomes, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. In 1997 \"Genealogies of a Crime\", directed by Raúl Ruiz, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival. \"The Letter\", directed by Manoel de Oliveira, was in competition for the Palme d'Or and it won the Jury Prize at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. \"Time Regained\", directed by Raúl Ruiz, was also in competition for the Palme d'Or.\n\nNotable accolades of this decade were \"I'm Going Home\", directed by Manoel de Oliveira, in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival; \"The Uncertainty Principle\", also directed by de Oliveira, was in competition for the same award the following year. In 2004 de Oliveira won an Honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nIn 2005, thirteen Portuguese feature films released, one an animation co-produced with Spain, \"Midsummer Dream\". The most successful film of the year was \"O Crime do Padre Amaro\", with more than 300,000 viewers and grossing more than 1.3 million euros. The following year, 22 feature films were released, five of them documentaries. The most successful film that year was \"Filme da Treta\", with more than 270,000 viewers, grossing more than 1 million euros. In 2006 there were 19 feature films produced. In 2007, 15, in 2008, 21 and in 2009, 23. \"Colossal Youth\", directed by Pedro Costa, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Three years later, \"Arena\", directed by João Salaviza, won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe first Portuguese animated feature film, \"João Sete Sete\", premiered in 2006 on Cinanima.\n\nIn 2010 Portugal produced 22 feature films. The next year, it produced 19, with the most commercially successful being \"Blood of My Blood\" by João Canijo with 20,953 views and a gross of €97,800. The share of native cinema at the Portuguese box office was 0.7%.\n\nOn the artistic side, one of the most successful films was Joaquim Sapinho's \"This Side of Resurrection\", which premiered at the Visions programme at the Toronto International Film Festival with a US premiere at the Harvard Film Archive in Boston.\n\nAt the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival, in 2012, \"Tabu\", directed by Miguel Gomes, was in competition for the Golden Bear and \"Rafa\", directed by João Salaviza, won the Golden Bear for Best Short Film. \"The Lines of Wellington\" was in competition for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. As of 11 November 2012, the highest grossing Portuguese film of the year was \"Balas & Bolinhos - O Último Capítulo\" with a €1.243 million gross, followed by \"Morangos com Açúcar – O Filme\" with €1,208 million.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2269997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269997", "title": "Kotturu, Karnataka", "text": "Kotturu, Karnataka\n\nKotturu is a Panchayat town in the Bellary district of the Indian state of Karnataka. It was the home of Guru Kottureshwara, a 15th-century Hindu saint. More than 200,000 people gather during the car festival (rathotsava) held during February every year. Kottur taluk belongs to Bellary district.\n\nKotturu is famous for a dish called \"mandakki-menasinakayi\", a mixture of puffed rice with savories, accompanied by chili pepper fritters. The chilli peppers are slit along their lengths, stuffed with a condiment of salt and crushed cumin, dipped in lentil batter, and deep fried.\n\nKotturu is named after Saint Kottureshwara, so its history stems from the history of Guru Kottureshwara. Legend has it that, when the Lingayath Dharma was leaning towards Vedic Sanathana style, to refine and to create awareness about Basavadi pranitha sharana Dharma to people and to make them understand about shatsthala, Ashtavarana Lord Kottureswara spent his lifetime here. That is why devotees call him as Astavarana Tatvopadeshi Guru. It is believed that he placed in his heart all the people and solved everyone's problems.\n\nThe Virasaiva religion was brought into practice by Lord Basavanna in the 12th century and lord Kottureswara was the continuity of same \"sharana parampare\" established by Basavanna and sharanas. Kottu or Kodu in Kannada means give and Eshwar means God (Kotu + Eshwara= Kottureshwara). No one knows about the birth and childhood of Kottureswara, but he reached shikhapura at a young age. He travelled from North Kashmir to Kanyakumari. During the ruling of Akbar in Delhi, Lord Kottureswar appeared in the bedroom of Akbar's wife as an Old saint and blessed her. Hearing the voice of the old man, the guard informed this to the emperor. Akbar in anger came in to the queen's bedroom and saw the mid aged person sleeping in the queen's bed. For the Queen Kottureshwara appeared as a saint and for Akbar he appeared as an ordinary man. In his fury, he attacked Kottureshwar with sword but to his astonishment the sword became a flower Garland. By this Akbar realized his mistake and surrendered to the Lord. Lord Kottureshwar blessed Akbar and the Rajput queen. Akbar presented Lord Kottureshwar with his Sword and the Cot on which lord Kottureshwara was sleeping. This Cot is located at Gachchina Mutt of Kotturu even now. He also offered him Sarsipura or Shikapura an independent territory which was under his ruling.\n\nLord Kottureswara's temples are divided into 4 shrines in Kottur \n\nIn first mutt is the one where the Lord appeared first in the land of Kotturu.\nSecond mutt is where the lord blessed a child. Third Is the mutt where he used give sadare (preaching on religion) and solve the problems of the people. The fourth is the mutt where Guru Kottureswara entered Ikya Stala the final stage of Shudstala (Yoga Samadhi).\n\nThere is another story related to the Gachhina mutt. Earlier this used to be a temple of Lord Veerabhadra. Once people started visiting Lord Kottureswara to get the blessings, and begin to lessen the worship of lord Veerabhadra. Lord Veerabhadra complained about this to Lord Kottureshwara. Then the guru asked him to occupy another place called Kodathgudda where Lord Veerabhadra's temple is situated now. This is also an equally famous temple in this region.\n\nLord Kottureshwara visited a village near Mysuru and noticed the devotion of a priest in the temple (named Karilingeswara). He requested him to come with him and be his disciple and henceforth the priest of the temple in Kotturu. There is also a saying that he ordered only the children from his family should to be the priests for the forthcoming generations. Hence to take care of the priest's family a land was given in the nearby village called K. Ayyanahalli. There is a temple dedicated to Karilingeswara in this village. Some of the descendants of his family continue to do the worship at the Hiremath and stay in this village.\n\nIn memory of Lord Kottureshwara, devotees name their sons as Kotresh and daughters as Kotturamma. These names are commonly found in and around Kotturu.\n\nThere is an annual fair which happens just before MahaShivaratri. Devotees from all over assemble to witness the fair and the car festival. Some of the devotees even reach Kottur by walk from their native place. During the month of December there will be Karthikotsava.\n\nThere is a temple of Kotturamma (Parvathi) on the outskirts of Kottur. Kotturamma is neither the wife or related to Lord Kottureshwara but a form of Goddess Parvathi. The Karnam family of Kottur maintains the temple. There is a festival in every August where in which lakhs of people attend the festival. The place is famed by a veteran theater person Kotturappa, a legendary actor, whose performance in the role of Danashoora Karna is widely known throughout Karnataka. Deshi, Devaramane Shivanandappa, is the first Writer from this place who was also a sub editor of the\nlocal daily, RAITA, from Bellary.

{"id": "2270005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270005", "title": "Atlantic menhaden", "text": "Atlantic menhaden\n\nThe Atlantic menhaden (\"Brevoortia tyrannus\") is a North American species of fish in the herring family, Clupeidae.\n\nAtlantic menhaden are found in the North Atlantic coastal and estuarine waters from Nova Scotia south to northern Florida. They are commonly found in all salinities of the Chesapeake Bay and Mid-Atlantic water. They swim in large schools that stratify by size and age along the coast. Younger and smaller fish are found in the Chesapeake Bay and southern coastline while older, larger fish are found along the northern coastline.\n\nAtlantic menhaden are silvery coloured fishes characterized by a moderately compressed body and a black spot on their shoulder behind their gill openings. They can reach a size of approximately 15 inches.\n\nAtlantic menhaden are filter feeders, meaning that they collect food by filtering water through modifications of the branchial apparatus (gill arches and gill rakers). Atlantic menhaden's diet depends on the size of their gill rakers, which change as menhaden age. When the rakers are smaller, which generally correspond to when they are under the age of 1, Atlantic menhaden feed primarily on phytoplankton. As they age and their gill rakers grow larger, menhaden shift their diet to primarily consume zooplankton.\n\nAtlantic menhaden can spawn year round in inshore waters off the Atlantic coast, with the highest spawning rates near North Carolina in the late fall. The eggs hatch in the open ocean and the larvae drift to sheltered estuaries via ocean currents. The young spend a year developing in these estuaries before returning to the open ocean. At this early stage, they are commonly known as \"peanut bunker\". Atlantic menhaden usually do not become sexually mature until the end of their second year, after which they reproduce until death. A young, sexually mature female can produce roughly 38,000 eggs, while a fully mature female can produce upwards of 362,000.\n\nEggs are buoyant and hatch within 2 to 3 days depending on the temperature. The larvae will spend 1 to 3 months in waters over the continental shelf. The Chesapeake Bay is a popular nursery for juvenile menhaden. Larval fish will enter the Bay in late winter and early summer. The larval fish will move into lower salinity waters in estuarine tributaries while juvenile and immature fish remain in the Bay until the fall. Atlantic menhaden can live up to 10 to 12 years.\n\nAtlantic menhaden are preyed upon by fish such as striped bass, weakfish and bluefish, and by birds such as ospreys and eagles. Humpback whales off the coast of New Jersey feed on Atlantic menhaden. Other cetaceans, such as fin whales and dolphins also eat menhaden. Dolphins can eat up to 20 pounds of Atlantic menhaden a day.\n\nMenhaden have historically been used as a fertilizer for crops. It is likely that menhaden is the fish that Squanto taught the Pilgrims to bury alongside freshly planted seeds as fertilizer. Other uses for menhaden include: feed for animals, bait for fish, oil for human consumption, oil for manufacturing purposes and oil as a fuel source.\n\nIn the early years of the United States, Atlantic menhaden were being harvested by thousand of ships of fishermen. The Atlantic coastline was lined with processing facilities to quickly transform the fish into a product of worth, typically oil but later fish meal became more popular. Tragedy of the commons set in and the menhaden population began to dwindle. Many of these small companies could not manage, which left only a handful of menhaden fishing companies to remain on the Atlantic coast.\n\nWhile many sources today claim that the menhaden is inedible, the fish were once consumed as sardines might be, or fried. Maine fisherman, for example, would eat fried pogies for breakfast. The fish that were not sold for bait would be sold to the poorer classes for food.\n\nIn the Atlantic, menhaden are targeted by two types of fisheries, a reduction fishery and a bait fishery. They are also taken directly by recreational fishing for use as bait.\n\nThe reduction fishery processes whole menhaden into fish meal, fish oil, and fish solubles while the bait fishery supplies fishermen with menhaden as bait for key commercial and recreational fisheries. Both menhaden fisheries use a process known as purse seine fishing, in which two fishing boats surround a single school of fish with a large net. Purse seining is one of the most efficient methods of fishing available, with one of the lowest levels of bycatch. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has cited the Atlantic and Gulf menhaden fisheries as having one of the lowest levels of bycatch in the world. The reduction fishery is largely based in the Chesapeake Bay and nearby Atlantic waters, and its season runs annually starting in May through the fall.\n\nThe bait fishery operates throughout the Atlantic coastline, ranging from North Carolina to New England. Cast nets are also used for bait catch in the recreational fishing sector.\n\nThe fishery's sustainability has also been certified by independent organizations. Friend of the Sea, an international seafood sustainability certification program, has recognized both the Atlantic menhaden and Gulf menhaden fisheries as sustainable. This is both due to the healthy status of the stock as well as the fishery's low levels of bycatch, which it achieves with the use of purse seine nets.\n\nAtlantic menhaden are managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), an interstate compact formed under an agreement by the 15 Atlantic coast states. Like with other species, the ASMFC manages menhaden to prevent overfishing and to keep the stock from being overfished. There is a subtle but distinct difference between the two designations. Overfishing occurs when too many fish are being taken from the population of a fish stock. A stock is considered overfished when it is not able to produce enough new fish to maintain the population.\n\nThe ASMFC uses two biological measurements, or reference points, to measure the health of the menhaden stock. To determine if the stock is overfished, the ASMFC measures fecundity (FEC), the number of mature eggs in the menhaden population, which indicates the stock's reproductive capability. To measure overfishing, the ASMFC monitors fish mortality (F), the measure of the amount of fish removed from the water. In 2010, the ASMFC's stock assessment found that the stock's mortality levels were high enough that overfishing was occurring, but its fecundity level indicated that it was not overfished.\n\nBecause the ASMFC's 2010 assessment concluded that Atlantic menhaden was experiencing overfishing, some conservation, fishing and other organizations began urging the Commission to impose new harvest restrictions, and the ASMFC began the process of drafting new catch limits. This culminated the development of Amendment 2 to the menhaden Fishery Management Plan that established a total allowable catch (TAC) of 170,800 metric tons (376,549,544 pounds), effectively reducing the coastwide harvest by 20 percent compared to average landings from 2009-2011.\n\nThe cuts followed a sustained campaign by environmental groups like Chesapeake Bay Foundation, as well as authors like Paul Greenberg, who called for a ban on fishing menhaden in US federal waters and the Chesapeake Bay. The decision was opposed by many working in the menhaden fishery, who considered the cuts unnecessary and economically harmful.\n\nThe TAC created the first ever coastwide catch limit, though the ASMFC had earlier instituted a harvest cap on the number of menhaden that can be caught in the Chesapeake Bay to address concerns of localized depletion. \nAccording to recent reports, the stocks are not overfished in the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nCritics have since evaluated several claims made about the status of menhaden during the development of the 2012 management measures. For example, claims about historic overfishing of menhaden made by the Pew Charitable Trusts were rated “mostly false” by the Providence Journal's Politifact column, which took issue with Pew saying 90 percent decline in abundance had occurred in recent years, rather than citing the 88 percent decline from 1982 to 2008.\n\nThe latest stock assessment, published in early 2015, indicates that the stock is not currently subject to overfishing and has not been at an overfished population level since the 1990s. The ASMFC unanimously accepted the stock assessment to use for management in May 2015 and increased the TAC to 187,880 metric tons (414,204,498 pounds). They also voted to begin Amendment 3 to consider changes to the current state‐by‐state allocation scheme and establish ecological reference points to help them, as Menhaden Management Board Chair Robert Boyles stated in the ASFMC's May 6, 2015 press release, fully evaluat[e] the ecological role of Atlantic menhaden through the amendment process.”\n\nWhile popularly cited as filter feeders that remove excess algae and nutrients from the water, evidence suggests that menhaden do not significantly impact water quality. Adult menhaden largely do not eat phytoplankton, whose excessive growth leads to dead zones, instead feeding mainly on zooplankton. There is evidence that, because menhaden secrete nitrogen, that they may actually be a net contributor to phytoplankton growth.\n\nSeparate, but related, to the issue of dead zones are fish kills, where large numbers of menhaden or other fish will turn up dead in a single area. According to the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences, which investigates fish kills in the Chesapeake Bay, the causes of fish kills are varied, but often are related to environmental factors such as low amounts of oxygen in the water, algal blooms, and water temperatures that are either too hot or too cold. Other factors, such as the dumping hazardous materials or excess bycatch, can also contribute.\n\nDue to the change in striped bass population many have begun to cite the commercial harvesting of menhaden as the reasoning behind the shift. Several claims state that menhaden are a key staple in the striped bass diet. However, other studies see the striped bass as an opportunistic feeder with a variety of aquatic creatures that it consumes and therefore does not completely rely on the menhaden. In fact, menhaden has been represented as low as 8% of the striped bass diet.\n\n\n"}

This birthplace name, in turn, has Basque roots, etymologically originating in the word \"etxaberri\" (\"etxe berri\" in standard spelling), meaning \"castle\" or \"new house\".\n\nThe original place name went through a Romance phonetic change in Navarro-Aragonese, a Romance language spoken in the neighbouring Romanzado (cf. Leire) from the Early Middle Ages. Like examples can be found in Irunberri > Lumbier, Erronkari > Roncal. It was later borrowed by Castilian. Other variations of this name include Xaverius, Xever, Javiero, and Saverio. The feminine Javiera, Saveria, Zaviera, and Saverina are less common.\n\n\"Etxeberria\", \"Echeverría\", \"Echevarría\", \"Etxebarri\", and \"Chávarri\" are Basque surnames related to the name by etymology.\n\nIts diffusion is due to the fame of Jesuit priest and missionary Saint Francis Xavier (). When he was canonized, places and people were named after him, which popularized the name.\n\nContemporary use of the name Javier is found in Spain, Equatorial Guinea and Latin American countries, where it is popular.\n\n\nPortuguese kept the pronunciation of \"x\" as the English \"sh\". Therefore, in Portuguese the name is still spelled Xavier and maintains the original \"sh\" pronunciation.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, especially in the British media, the pronunciation of \"Javier\" is frequently confused with the pronunciation of French words or names ending in \"-ier\" such as Xavier or Olivier. The resulting pronunciation \"HAV-ee-ay\" is a hybrid of Spanish, French and English. In Spanish, correctly spoken, the final syllable sounds much like the English word \"air\", not the English word \"eh\".\n\nEnglish speakers, sometimes pronounce \"Xavier\" as \"zavier\" or \"ex-avier\". The latter pronunciation is used for the fictional character, Charles Xavier, leader of the X-Men, however it is not incorrect to pronounce it this way when considering that many 'X' words derive in English from the Greek phonetics, which pronounce it as a soft 'Ks' sound.\n\n\n\n"}

The city is located at the center of the Naypyidaw Union Territory. It is unusual among Myanmar's cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state or region, similar to Canberra in Australia, Brasília in Brazil, Washington, D.C. in the United States, Islamabad in Pakistan, and Abuja in Nigeria. The city officially replaced Yangon as the administrative capital of Myanmar in 2006.\n\nAs the seat of the government of Myanmar, Naypyidaw is the site of the Union Parliament, the Supreme Court, the Presidential Palace, the official residences of the Cabinet of Myanmar and the headquarters of government ministries and military. Naypyidaw is notable for its unusual combination of large size and very low population density. The city hosted the 24th and 25th ASEAN Summit, the 3rd BIMSTEC Summit, the Ninth East Asia Summit, and the 2013 Southeast Asian Games.\n\n\"Naypyidaw\" is Burmese for \"abode of the king\", and is generally translated as \"royal capital\", \"seat of the king\", or \"abode of kings\". Traditionally, it was used as a suffix to the names of royal capitals, such as Mandalay, which was called Yattanarbon Naypyidaw ().\n\nNaypyidaw has a short history. It was founded on a greenfield site near Pyinmana, about north of the old capital, Yangon. Construction started in 2002 and was completed by 2012. At least 25 construction companies were hired by the military government to build the city, including Asia World and Htoo Ltd.\n\nOn 6 November 2006, more than 12,000 troops marched in the new capital in its first public event: a massive military parade to mark Armed Forces Day—which is the anniversary of then Burma's 1945 revolution against the Japanese occupation of Burma. Filming was restricted to the concrete parade ground which contains three enormous sculptures—depictions of King Anawrahta, Bayinnaung and Alaungpaya, who are considered the three greatest monarchs in the history of Myanmar. The city was officially named Naypyidaw during these ceremonies, and the official, albeit mostly administrative, capital of the country was relocated from Yangon to Naypyidaw.\n\nThere are several assumptions why the capital was moved: Naypyidaw is more centrally located than the old capital, Yangon. It is also a transportation hub located adjacent to the Shan, Kayah, and Kayin states. It was felt by governmental and military leaders that a stronger military and governmental presence nearby might provide stability to those chronically turbulent regions. Climate consideration could have also contributed to the capital transfer, since Yangon proved vulnerable to Cyclone Nargis, which killed over 100,000 people in Myanmar in May 2008. The official explanation for moving the capital was that Yangon had become too congested and crowded with little room for future expansion of government offices. Another reason might be that during World War II, Pyinmana township, close to the new capital, was the headquarters of Gen Aung San, the Father of the Nation of modern-day Myanmar.\n\nNaypyidaw is located between the Bago Yoma and Shan Yoma mountain ranges. The city covers an area of and has a population of 924,608, according to official figures.\n\nChaungmagyi Dam is located a few kilometers to the north of Naypyidaw, while Ngalaik Dam is a few kilometers to the south. The Yezin Dam is farther away in the north-east.\n\nNaypyidaw is organized into a number of zones.\n\nThe residential areas are carefully organised, and apartments are allotted according to rank and marital status. The city currently has 1,200 four-story apartment blocks. The roofs of apartment buildings are color-coded by the jobs of their residents; Ministry of Health employees live in buildings with blue roofs and Ministry of Agriculture employees live in those with green roofs. High-ranking government officials live in mansions, of which there are about 50. However, in 2019, quite a few of the ministerial mansions were reported to be unused and left in a neglected state in overgrown compounds.\n\nThe city's Ministry zone contains the headquarters of Myanmar's government ministries. All the ministry buildings are identical in appearance. A parliamentary complex consisting of 31 buildings and a 100-room presidential palace are also located there. The zone also contains the city hall building, which has many characteristics of Stalinist architecture, but with a Burmese-style roof.\n\nHigh-ranking military officers and other key officials live away from regular government employees in a complex said to consist of tunnels and bunkers; this area is restricted to the public. The city also hosts a military base, which is inaccessible to citizens or other personnel without written permission.\n\nThe government has set aside of land each for foreign embassies and headquarters of United Nations missions. The Chinese embassy has formally opened its interim liaison office in 2017. The liaison office is the first foreign office to be permitted to open in Naypyidaw. Bangladesh and Malaysia have also signed agreements to open embassies in Naypyidaw. The government confirms that proposals have been put forward by 11 other countries to move their embassies to Naypyidaw, namely Russia, China, the United States, India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey and Kuwait. In February 2018, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi chaired a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Naypyidaw where she urged foreign governments to move their embassies to the capital.\n\nThe Hotel zone has a handful of villa-style hotels on the hilly outskirts of the city. There are currently twelve hotels located in or near Naypyidaw. Eight of these are located within the Naypyidaw Hotel Zone, and two are located in Laeway (Lewe) on the Yangon-Mandalay Road. Forty villas were constructed near the Myanmar Convention Centre in preparation for the 25th ASEAN summit conducted in Naypyidaw in November 2014. Construction of the villas was begun in 2010 by the government. However, funds were limited, so the project was later put out to tender for completion by private sector investors. A total of 348 hotels and 442 inns were constructed to house the athletes and spectators of the 2013 Southeast Asian Games, which was hosted in Naypyidaw.\n\nNaypyidaw Myoma Market is the commercial centre of Naypyidaw. Other shopping areas include Thapye Chaung Market and Junction Centre Naypyidaw. Junction Centre is the city's first privately operated shopping centre. There are also local markets and a restaurant area.\n\nNgalaik Lake Gardens is a small water park situated along the Ngalaik Dam, near Kyweshin Village on Ngalaik Lake (about from Naypyidaw). Opened in 2008, facilities at the Ngalaik Lake Gardens include water slides, natural resorts, lodging and a beach. The gardens are open to the public during Thingyan holidays.\n\nAlso opened in 2008, the National Herbal Park has exhibits of plants having medicinal applications from all of the major regions of Myanmar. There are thousands of plants at the park, representing hundreds of different species. Behind the city hall, there is a park with a playground and water fountain complex, which hosts a musical light show every night.\n\nThe Naypyidaw Zoological Gardens opened in 2008 with 420 species and now with 1500 animals. The main attraction of the zoo is the climate-controlled penguin house. The animals were shipped to it from the old one in Yangon. The Naypyidaw Safari Park officially opened on 12 February 2011.\n\nNaypyidaw also has two golf courses (Naypyidaw City Golf Course and Yaypyar Golf Course) and a gem museum.\n\nSimilar in size and shape to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Uppatasanti Pagoda was completed in 2009. This new pagoda is named the Uppatasanti or \"Peace Pagoda\". The stake-driving ceremony for the pagoda was held on 12 November 2006. The invitation card for the ceremony opened with a phrase \"Rajahtani Naypyidaw (the royal capital where the king resides)\". The pagoda is just shorter than the Shwedagon Pagoda. Uppatasanti translates roughly to \"Protection against Calamity\". It is the name of a sūtra prepared by a monk in the early 16th century. It is to be recited in time of crisis, especially in the face of foreign invasion.\n\nNaypyidaw is administered by the Naypyidaw Union Territory which is under the direct administration of the President. Day-to-day functions are carried out on the President's behalf by the Naypyidaw Council led by a Chairperson. The Chairperson and members of the Naypyidaw Council are appointed by the President and include both civilians and Armed Forces representatives.\n\nNaypyidaw Development Committee (NPTDC) is the administrative body of the capital. Naypyidaw Development Committee (NPTDC) consists of 5 to 9 members, it is led by a Chairman who acts as the Mayor, and a Vice-Chairman who acts as the Vice-Mayor.\n\nThe Naypyidaw Union Territory consists of the city proper (downtown) and eight surrounding townships. Downtown is further divided into four wards. Pyinmana, Lewe, and Tatkone townships were all formerly part of Yamethin District. Ottarathiri, Dekkhinathiri, Popphathiri, Zabuthiri, and Zeyathiri are all new townships currently under construction. As of December 2009, most government ministry offices have been relocated to the administrative capital. Only the offices of ministries' directorates remain in Yangon.\n\n\nThere is sometimes some controversy about land use and changes in land ownership related to the urban spread of Naypyidaw. In late 2014, for example, there were suggestions in parliament that land grabs were occurring near the Dekkhinathiri Township and that existing laws needed to be amended to provide better protection for farmers. There has also been criticism from some members of parliament about the size of the Naypyidaw Union Territory and the fact that money is being spent on urban infrastructure (such as lighting around lakes) although the facilities do not attract much use.\n\nNaypyidaw International Airport, also known as Ayelar Airport, is south-east of the city, between the towns of Ela and Lewe. It is served by all domestic airlines—Air Bagan, Air Mandalay, Myanmar National Airlines, FMI Air and Yangon Airways—with regular flights to Yangon and other cities across the country. According to the Transport Ministry, the airport has a 3.6 kilometer runway, a control tower 69 meters high and 10 passenger boarding bridges and can take 50,000 to 65,000 flights annually. Bangkok Airways and China Eastern Airlines serve the airport with international flights to and from Bangkok and Kunming.\n\nPublic transport services are limited between neighborhoods. The four-lane, Yangon-Naypyidaw highway links Naypyidaw with Yangon directly and is part of the long Yangon-Naypyidaw-Mandalay Expressway. There is a 20-lane boulevard; like most roads in the city, it is largely empty. Naypyidaw has four-lane roads and multilevel, flower-covered roundabouts (traffic circles). Government ministries run shuttle buses in the morning and evening to their respective buildings.\n\nThe city has a central bus station and one taxi company, which is operated by the military. Motorbikes are banned from some roads in Naypyidaw city limits, including sections of Taw Win Yadana Road, as a result of hundreds of traffic accident-related deaths in 2009.\n\nNaypyidaw railway station was opened at milepost No. (233/0), between Ywataw station and Kyihtaunggan station on the Yangon-Mandalay railroad with a station area of and a covered area of . Construction began on 8 December 2006 and Naypyidaw railway station was opened on 5 July 2009, even though the overpass, locomotive shed, concrete road leading up to the station, parking lot, passenger lounge and platform were not completed.\n\nBefore the opening of Naypyidaw railway station, Naypyidaw was served by Pyinmana and Lewe stations, though only Pyinmana station is on the main rail line (which extends from Yangon-Bago-Naypyidaw-Thazi-Mandalay). Lewe station is on the way from Pyinmana to Kyaukpadaung. It takes nine hours by train to get from Yangon to Pyinmana; trains leave at 12:00 and arrive at 21:30 local time.\n\nIn August 2011, Russian news media announced that a Russian-based firm would be constructing a metro line, which would be the country's first underground rail system, underneath Naypyidaw. However, the Rail Transportation Ministry then announced that the plan had been cancelled due to lack of demand and budgetary limits.\n\n\nYezin (a few kilometers north-east of Naypyidaw and Pyinmana)\n\n\n\nThe city is served by five public hospitals: 1000-bed Naypyidaw General Hospital, Naypyidaw Women Hospital, Naypyidaw ENT Hospital, 100-bedded Naypyidaw Traditional Medicine Hospital, and Naypyidaw Orthopaedic Hospital. There is also a 300-bed Obstetric, Gynaecological and Children's Hospital of Defence Services, which is one of the teaching hospitals of Myanmar Defence Services Medical Academy. The nearby towns of Lewe, Pyinmana, and Tatkone each have one hospital.\n\nNaypyidaw F.C, a Myanmar National League football club, is based at Wunna Theikdi Stadium in Naypyidaw.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Myanmar Motion Picture Academy Awards are held annually in Naypyidaw given to the highest achievers in Burmese cinema. There is a movie theater in the Junction Centre Mall as well as in the Ocean Shopping Mall. There are two others in nearby Pyinmana, and one in Tatkone Township.\n\nThe headquarter of the Ministry of Information is located in Naypyidaw. Since 2009, Naypyidaw has had mobile phone coverage.\n\nThe \"Myanmar Alin\" and the \"Kyaymon\" in Burmese and the \"New Light of Myanmar\" in English are available in Naypyidaw. Since 18 November 2011, the Ministry of Information has begun publishing a weekly journal called the \"Naypyidaw\" \"Times\", to report on government policies.\n\nThere are a number of AM and FM stations broadcasting in Naypyidaw. The main available channels in Naypyidaw are Radio Myanmar (operated by MRTV), Cherry FM, Mandalay FM, FM Bagan, Padamyar FM, Pyinsawaddy FM, Shwe FM and City FM.\n\nMRTV, MRTV-4 and MWD are the main channels, broadcasting Burmese-language programmes in Naypyidaw. Privately owned enterprise Sky Net provides more than 70 pay-TV channels of local and international origin. MRTV broadcasts 19 free-to-air channels and MWD broadcasts 8 free-to-air channels. Other TV channels such as Channel 7, 5-plus and Myanmar International, the English-language channel that targets overseas audiences are also available.\n\nThe establishment of Naypyidaw was an extraordinary project. However, the shorter-term and long-term consequences of establishing the new capital are not yet clear.\n\nData on the economic impact of constructing Naypyidaw are scarce but the national economic impact of the huge construction effort must have been very considerable. One estimate puts the cost in the range of $3–4 billion although only part of this estimate is for cash spending because non-cash investments were also reportedly involved in supporting the construction effort. There must have been a large localized construction boom, the result of which is that a vast new economic asset has been created. On the other hand, current (mid 2014) utilization of the vast new asset is very low. Most of the remarkable main roads in the city (10 lane roadways are common) are ghost roads for much of the time. There are also large areas of vacant land between many buildings.\n\nOne of the consequences of administration for the nation is that there is now continual travel by vehicles along the relatively new 300 km highway from Yangon to Naypyidaw. But the highway is four lanes for most of the way. There is clearly a large amount of excess capacity because there are relatively few vehicles for much of the time on the road. Most trucks traveling North from Yangon to Naypyidaw and Mandalay are prohibited from using the highway. The Asian Development Bank has estimated that allowing more trucks onto the road would save over $100 million per year in reduced traveling time and other savings. Remarkably, there are plans to turn the road into a six lane highway because it is believed that a wider road would be safer to travel on.\n\nIt has not been easy to encourage expatriates from the diplomatic and international business community in Yangon to relocate to Naypyidaw. The capital is seen as lacking facilities such as international health care, residential housing, and convenient transport arrangements. Despite the generous areas of land in Naypyidaw, the proportion of housing that meets expatriate needs is limited because the majority of existing apartments are for government employees.\n\nIn March 2014, Naypyidaw was one of the locations featured on the British motoring TV show \"Top Gear\" during a two-part special event in Myanmar.\n\nSometime in 2018, in the TV show \"Dark Tourist\", David visits the capital, Naypyidaw.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1913 he put in for the École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO), but ranked second behind Georges Demasur. On 3 January 1914 he married Louise Carlier, who gave him four sons and was a devoted mate. He served during World War I in a balloon unit, and then finally on 11 June 1919 he achieved the qualification of .\n\nHe lived in Paris several years, working mostly as freelance architect, but never losing his interest in Indochina. Thanks to his cousin, François Glaize, he was recruited by the \"Crédit foncier et de l'Union immobilière d'Indochine\" and worked as architect and agency manager at Phnom Penh from 1928 to 1930 (participating into the building of the Royal Palace), then as architect-in-chief at Saigon from 1931 to 1934.\n\nHis contract wasn't renewed at the end of 1934 due to world economic crisis so, while on leave in France, when he became acquainted with the tragic death of Georges Alexandre Trouvé he put in for open position. His candidacy was formally accepted and after a temporary contract with \"Crédit foncier de l'Ouest africain\" at Dakar, he embarked for Saigon at Marseille with his wife and two children on 2 October 1936. He was appointed permanent member of EFEO on 1 December 1936 and \"Conservator of Angkor\" in following year.\n\nHe initially accepted a relatively poor wage from government, considering his qualifications and the present state of his family, and encountered some difficulties dealing with colonial administration. Besides that it was only some years later, thanks to general governor Catroux, that restoration funds raised to a notable level.\n\nIn spite of such economical restrictions, his work was surely impressive and involved many buildings, not only at Ankgor. Sometimes his intervention was limited and consisted in excavation and consolidation, as for East Mebon (1937-1939), Phnom Krom (1938) and Phnom Bok (1939). For other buildings he used partially anastylosis, as in Neak Pean (1938-1939), Preah Khan, Bayon (between 1939 and 1946) and the North Gate of Angkor Thom, but in particular cases he opted for deeper or larger interventions, as in Preah Palilay (1938-1938), Bakong (1936-1944), Banteay Samré (1936-1946) and West Mebon (1943-1944). The extent of his work led George Coedès to assert that Maurice Glaize's name will remain bound to the resurrection of the Khmer capital city of Angkor.\n\nHe also made several notable findings, like sculptures and foundation steles (e.g. the stele of Preah Khan), and some critical analysis of methodologies of restoration of Khmer monuments (see Glaize, 1941 and 1946). In 1944 he was the third conservator of Angkor (after Henri Parmentier and Henri Marchal) who published a guide of Angkor, entitled \"Les Monuments du groupe d'Angkor\", which is still now a reference text for visitors and is available freely in English on The Angokor Guide.\n\nIn 1946 the majority of French scholars left Indochina. After an extended leave, Maurice Glaize renounced to come back to Cambodia and settled in La Rochelle, where he participated in restoration works of the city. After having suffered health problems for several years, on 17 July 1964 he died of cerebral haemorrhage in La Rochelle during sleep.\n\nAfter Henri Marchal, who introduced anastylosis in Angkor, Maurice Glaize succeeded in adapting that method to available resources, value and structural conditions of each building. His work led to a better understanding of the role of architectural representations in Khmer civilization (Neak Pean, West Mebon). With Maurice Glaize restoration work and architectural research fed mutually, this became a primary principle in the following interventions of the EFEO in Cambodia.\n\nGradually the chaos becomes ordered, and one perceives the profusion of towers as being made from a\ncombination of elements grouped at the centre in a sort of bunched sheaf.\n\nIt’s no longer the building that matters, but only its symbolism.\n\n– Maurice Glaize, speaking about Bayon, in \"A Guide to the Angkor Monuments\"\n\n"}

The second part is concerned with chess in Europe in the Middle Ages, its role in literature and in the moralities, and with medieval chess problems, leading up to the beginning of modern chess and the history of the modern game through to the 19th century.\n\nMurray, who knew the English and German languages, taught himself Arabic to read chess documents. By collating sources and eliminating duplicates therein he lists 553 complete Islamic shatranj chess problems and their stated solutions, plus 16 \"mikhāriq\" (\"puzzles\", singular \"mikhrāq\") (which he numbers RW29 and 554 to 568). During this, he was caused extra work by finding that one of his Arabic-language source documents was descended from a predecessor whose pages had been shuffled and some pages lost, which was then copied by another scribe in old times.\n\nThe book also contains a list of medieval European chess problems.\n\nAs some chess variants do not use an 8×8 board, he uses the algebraic notation to represent chess moves, but:\n\nHe quotes lengths of text from older European sources untranslated from their original languages (medieval forms of French and German and Spanish etc.).\n\nMurray's companion work was \"A History of Board-Games other than Chess\" .

The pre-determined overhead rate is calculated before the period begins. The first step is to estimate the amount of the activity base that will be required to support operations in the upcoming period. The second step is to estimate the total manufacturing cost at that level of activity. The third step is to compute the predetermined overhead rate by dividing the estimated total manufacturing overhead costs by the estimated total amount of cost driver or activity base. Common activity bases used in the calculation include direct labor costs, direct labor hours, or machine hours.\n\nThis is related to an activity rate which is a similar calculation used in Activity-based costing. A pre-determined overhead rate is normally the term when using a single, plant-wide base to calculate and apply overhead. Overhead is then applied by multiplying the pre-determined overhead rate by the \"actual\" driver units. Any difference between applied overhead and the amount of overhead actually incurred is called over- or under-applied overhead.\n\nInstead of using a pre-determined rate based on estimates, why not base the overhead rate on the actual total manufacturing overhead cost and the actual total amount of the activity base incurred on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis? If an actual rate is computed monthly or quarterly, seasonal factors in overhead costs or in the activity base can produce fluctuations in the overhead rate. For example, the costs of heating and cooling a factory in Illinois will be highest in the winter and summer months and lowest in the spring and fall. If the overhead rate is recomputed at the end of each month or each quarter based on actual costs and activity, the overhead rate would go up in the winter and summer and down in the spring and fall. As a result, two identical jobs, one completed in the winter and one completed in the spring, would be assigned different manufacturing overhead costs. Many managers believe that such fluctuations in product costs serve no useful purpose. To avoid such fluctuations, actual overhead rates could be computed on an annual or less-frequent basis. However, if the overhead rate is computed annually based on the actual costs and activity for the year, the manufacturing overhead assigned to any particular job would not be known until the end of the year. For example, the cost of Job 2B47 at Yost Precision Machining would not be known until the end of the year, even though the job will be completed and shipped to the customer in March. For these reasons, most companies use predetermined overhead rates rather than actual overhead rates in their cost accounting systems.\n\nThe use of such a rate enables an enterprise to determine the approximate total cost of each job when completed. In recent years increased automation in manufacturing operations has resulted in a trend towards machine hours as the activity base in the calculation.\n\nTo find the overhead rate, first determine the right basis that will describe the best the behavior of the cost. Then, divide the total budgeted overhead by the basis to calculate the overhead rate:\n\nThere are many ways that can be used to determine the right basis for a given order. These bases are:\n\nIn order to find the overhead rate we will use the same basis that we have chosen by multiplying this basis by the calculated rate. For example, if we choose the labor hours to be the basis then we will multiply the rate by the direct labor hours in each task during the manufacturing process.\n\nFundamentals of Cost Accounting.

In fact, it contains ingredients popular in Japan: slices of beef (Hyōgo Prefecture is also famous for its Kobe beef), rice and demi-glace sauce (among others). It can be compared to another popular dish, the Japanese style hamburger steak with demi-glace sauce. Another variation is the Omuhayashi, a combination of Omurice and Hayashi rice.

According to the 1898 Chicago Bicycle Directory, approximately two-thirds of the country's bicycles and accessories were manufactured within of the city.\nMayor Richard J. Daley, like Harrison, was a supporter of bicycling. When he was inaugurated, the city had a limited number of bike paths. By the 1970s, Daley's administration had built a large network of lakefront bike paths, bicycle lanes on the road, a bicycle route and rush-hour bicycle lanes on Clark Street and Dearborn Street.\n\nIn the 2000s, Chicago roads and trails saw an increase in the number of bicyclists. This can, in part, be attributed to mayor Richard M. Daley. Daley said, \"My goal is to make the City of Chicago the most bicycle-friendly city in the U.S.\" Daley created a Mayor's Bicycle Advisory Council (MBAC) in order to encourage bicycling in the city.\n\nThe Council created the Chicago Department of Transportation Bike Program, a multimillion-dollar program funded primarily by Federal CMAQ funds, in order to achieve this end. The program, whose efforts are guided by the Bike 2015 Plan, approved in June 2006, has created over of new bike lanes, installed 10,000 bicycle racks, and installed of signed bike routes in 2006. The city has also sponsored events to promote biking, such as Bike The Drive, Bike to Work Rally, the L.A.T.E. Ride, the Commuter Challenge, and many other events. In November 2001, \"Bicycling\" magazine honored Chicago as the \"Best Cycling City in the United States\" of cities with more than one million residents.\n\nAll Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) & Pace buses are equipped with bicycle racks that accommodate two bicycles each, available for use at all times. Bicycles are allowed to board any Chicago Transit Authority train (\"the 'L'\"), except during the hours of 7–9 am and 4–6 pm on weekdays, up to two bikes per car. Bicycles are not allowed on trains on July 3 or 4. Folding bicycles, however, are allowed on CTA vehicles at all times. Metra, the commuter rail system, allows bicycles to ride on reverse commute, non-rush hour, and weekend Metra trains for no extra cost. Metra timetables list certain blackout dates and specify which trips disallow bicycles; folding bicycles are allowed at all times. This policy began in 2005.\n\nMost CTA rail stations have indoor, outdoor or outdoor sheltered bicycle parking. The Chicago Bicycle Program's Bike Parking website displays all stations and denotes the quantity and type of bicycle parking available. Most Metra stations have bicycle parking available.\n\nStarting in 2008, high capacity bike parking was constructed at four CTA rail stations: Damen (CTA Blue Line), Sox-35th (CTA), Jefferson Park (Metra-CTA), and Midway (CTA).\n\nDivvy, a bicycle sharing system, was launched on June 28, 2013 with 750 bikes at 75 stations. It has since expanded to 580 stations, making it the largest bike share system in North America in area covered, including 2016 expansions to near suburban communities including Evanston and Oak Park. Oak Park ended its partnership with Divvy in January 2018, and the stations and bikes were subsequently removed soon after.\n\nAccording to the CDOT, Chicago has just over of dedicated bike lanes covering much of the city. There are also several miles of roads signed and marked with shared lane markings (consisting of bike and chevron symbols, or bike symbols and arrows). As of August 2008, there are approximately of these types of shared bike lanes throughout the city. The Milwaukee Avenue bike lane and marked shared lane is one of the most popular on-street bikeways in the city: between 2003 and 2008, the number of bicyclists riding on the street has increased 377%. CDOT is counting the number of bicyclists on other city streets in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe City of Chicago publishes a Bike Lane Design Guide. The Bicycle Parking Program within the CDOT Bicycle Program lists almost 8,000 bike racks at over 4,000 locations in the city limits. More than half of the CTA 'L' stations have indoor or sheltered bike parking available to protect bicycles from inclement weather.\n\nThe McDonald's Cycle Center in Millennium Park was opened on July 16, 2004 just east of the Pritzker Pavilion. The building has indoor parking for bicycles, bicycle repair, showers, rental, lockers, and a cafe.\n\nThe Chicago Park District maintains an 18-mile multi-use path along Lake Michigan called the Lakefront Trail.\n\n\nThe monthly Critical Mass ride draws thousands of participants in the summer months. Participants gather at Daley Plaza on the last Friday of every month at 5:30 PM for a free ride.\n\nThe LATE Ride, sponsored by the Friends of the Parks, is an annual overnight tour of Chicago neighborhoods.\n\nActive Transportation Alliance hosts its annual Bike The Drive and Boulevard Lakefront Tour.\n\nEach summer, the Mayor's Office of Special Events (MOSE) hosts Bike Chicago, a series of bike friendly events around the city. MOSE and CDOT jointly operate the online calendar of events.\n\n\n"}

It is owned by Stingray Group. Presently the station is branded as \"97.5 K-Rock\" and broadcasts a classic rock format, although some recent rock songs have lately become part of the mix.\n\nOriginally launched in September 1982, it was called \"VO Stereo\" and later as \"97.5 VOFM\" and in the mid-1990s as \"Magic 97\".\n\nAfter a limited success with its easy listening format in the early 1980s as \"VO Stereo\", a management decision was undertaken to pursue a younger audience.\n\nThe late 1980s under the direction of manager Gary Butler and music Director Pat Murphy, the station began programming a mix of new and classic rock with great success. In less than two years, the station vaulted from last place to the number one FM station in St. John's with a predominately young male audience. Although pleased with the results, management set about to build a stronger audience that would include more female listeners.\n\nResearch indicated that the Adult Contemporary format was the number one music format in North America, and Magic was the most popular of station names. At the time the CHUM group were having great success in markets like Toronto, and in Halifax with CIOO-FM with the latest Hot Adult contemporary format. This is the format that was launched in the mid-1990s, known to listeners as \"Magic 97\". It became an instant hit with the audience and captured top ratings with young women. The new format was a marketing hit with advertisers as well. In addition to the new name Magic 97 and the music, Magic 97 became the first radio station to set itself apart by programming 40 Minute Music Marathons every hour throughout the day except for the Breakfast Morning Show. Gary Butler, Mike Campbell were programming the music with a special attention to local talent.\n\nVOCM-FM became the leader in launching home grown talent such as Great Big Sea who were played on the air, several months before being aired by any other radio station.\n\nIn 1990, Celebration Saturdays was introduced to station listeners. It was a three-hour block of party-themed music sponsored by Bender's On George, a local nightclub, hosted by Mike Campbell and later Micky Thomas. Its success led to the creation of the Celebration Roadshow on Friday nights starting in the summer of 1996. Celebration Saturdays was the last show aired on Magic 97 before the switch to \"97.5 K-Rock\".\nHowever, by early 2002, soon after Newcap bought the VOCM stations from the Butler family, its audience had apparently dipped enough that Newcap changed the format to classic rock, a format where research indicated untapped potential. Sure enough, it soon became the top-rated FM station in the St. John's market. Unexpectedly, much of its audience came from country music station CKIX-FM, also a Newcap property. It was enough that this station was promptly reformatted as well; it became a contemporary hit radio station, \"Hits FM\", serving much of the audience lost after the end of \"Magic 97\". The first song ever played on the rebranded \"K-Rock\" station was \"Layla\", by Derek and the Dominos.\n\nOn Sundays from 8am to 1pm, \"The Homebrew Show\" plays traditional Newfoundland, Celtic and Irish music not only on this station, but on all other K-Rock stations throughout the province. Other K-Rock shows heard provincewide include \"Mornings with Campbell & Candice\" on weekday mornings and \"Saturday in Big Tom's Shed\" hosted by JLaC.\n\nThe sole rebroadcaster of the station is VOCM-FM-1 Clarenville, which broadcasts at 100.7 MHz, although three other NewCap stations in the province (CKXD-FM Gander, CKXG-FM Grand Falls-Windsor and CKXX-FM Corner Brook) also feature the K-Rock brand and format. The brand is also shared by several other NewCap-owned stations throughout Canada.\n\nVOCM-FM is one of 2 Canadian FM station with a call sign beginning with the ITU prefix \"VO\". VOCM-FM and its sister station VOCM are among just four radio stations in Canada still bearing call signs beginning with \"VO\", issued to the Dominion of Newfoundland before its confederation into Canada in 1949. VOCM-FM first went on the air in 1982, well after Newfoundland became a Canadian province. But it took the historic callsign of its sister station VOCM, which FM stations in Canada may do, by adding the \"-FM\" suffix.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2270191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270191", "title": "Victor Willis", "text": "Victor Willis\n\nVictor Edward Willis (born July 1, 1951) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He is best known as the founding member of the disco group Village People and also as lead singer and co-songwriter for all of their most successful singles. In the group he performed costumed as a policeman or a naval officer.\n\nThe son of a Baptist preacher, Willis developed his singing skills in his father's church. With training in acting and dance, he went to New York and joined the prestigious Negro Ensemble Company. He appeared in many musicals and plays, including the original Broadway production of \"The Wiz\" in 1976 and subsequently, the Australian production.\n\nWillis also had written and recorded several albums in the mid-1970s for independent labels and was eventually introduced to French disco producer Jacques Morali. Morali, who dubbed him the \"young man with the big voice\", approached Willis and said, \"I had a dream that you sang lead vocals on my album and it went very, very big\".\n\nWillis agreed to sing lead and background vocals under the guise of Village People, an at that point non-existent concept group. The album \"Village People\" was released in July 1977, including the hits \"San Francisco (You've Got Me)\" and \"In Hollywood (Everybody is a Star)\", and became a huge hit in the burgeoning disco market. After an offer from Dick Clark for the group to perform on \"American Bandstand\", Morali and Willis were pressed to develop a \"real\" group around Willis to perform live. They did so by placing an ad in music trade papers for \"macho\" singers who \"could also dance\" and \"must have a mustache\".\n\nWillis was soon writing songs produced by and co-written with Morali for the group and other artists, which met with success. The Village People quickly rose to the top of the charts with Willis at the helm, scoring numerous major hits such as \"Macho Man\", \"Y.M.C.A.\", \"In the Navy\", and \"Go West\". \nIn 1980, as preparations for a Village People feature film \"Can't Stop the Music\" were under way, Willis left the group. Although he does not appear in the movie, he wrote the lyrics for two of the film's songs, \"Magic Night\" and \"Milkshake\". \"Can't Stop the Music\" is listed among Hollywood's bigger movie flops. After Willis departed, Village People never had another hit. In an attempt to \"recapture the magic\", Morali convinced him to return to the group in 1982 for the album \"Fox on the Box\". The album was never released in the United States. In 1983, Willis left the group again.\n\nIn 2013, Willis appeared on the TV One series \"Unsung\" in their two-hour special retrospective on the disco era. On June 28, 2016, Willis appeared as a contestant on the show \"To Tell the Truth\", and sang \"Y.M.C.A.\" as the credits rolled.\n\nAfter leaving Village People, Willis declined offers to record and consistently refused to perform any of his Village People hits. In 2010, he appeared at several Major League Baseball stadiums, performing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and leading the crowd for the traditional \"Y.M.C.A.\" 7th-inning stretch break.\n\nIn 1979, Willis recorded a solo album which remained unreleased for over 35 years. The album, \"Solo Man\", was finally released in August 2015.\n\nIn 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California ruled that under the provisions of the Copyright Act of 1976, Willis could terminate his copyright transfers to Scorpio Music and Can't Stop Productions, because \"a joint author who separately transfers his copyright interest may unilaterally terminate the grant.\" Willis subsequently held a 33% share of \"Go West\", \"Y.M.C.A.\", \"In the Navy,\" and other songs written for Village People and other acts.\n\nIn 2015, a jury determined that the sole writers of 13 songs were Morali and Willis, and the name Henri Belolo was removed, giving Willis a 50% ownership of those songs,\n\nIn 2017, Willis and Henri Belolo, Morali's business partner and co-owner of the group, reached an out-of-court settlement whereby Willis resumed his role as lead singer of Village People, and they resumed recording and touring internationally. In 2018, Willis announced via social media plans for upcoming Village People projects including a new studio album, a Christmas music video, and a re-issue of the group's 1979 concert originally released as the “live” portion of the album \"Live & Sleazy\".\n\nWillis struggled with drugs for numerous years after leaving Village People and had several run-ins with the law. Following an arrest in 2006, he was given probation and ordered into rehab at the Betty Ford Clinic. In 2007, following treatment, Willis made his first statement to the press in more than 25 years, saying, \"The nightmare of drug abuse is being lifted from my life... now that the haze of drugs are gone, I'm thinking and seeing clearer now than I have in years... I'm looking forward to living the second part of my life drug-free.\"\n\nFrom 1978 until 1982, Willis was married to Phylicia Ayers-Allen (now Phylicia Rashad), whom he met during the run of \"The Wiz\", and who later played Clair Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\". He also wrote the lyrics for her album, \"Josephine Superstar\". On November 17, 2007, Willis married a second time; his wife Karen is a lawyer and an entertainment executive.\n"}
