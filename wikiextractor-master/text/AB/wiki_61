This circuit is monitored by electrical equipment to detect the absence of the trains. Since this is a safety appliance, fail-safe operation is crucial; therefore the circuit is designed to indicate the presence of a train when failures occur. On the other hand, false occupancy readings are disruptive to railway operations and are to be minimized.\n\nTrack circuits allow railway signalling systems to operate semi-automatically, by displaying signals for trains to slow down or stop in the presence of occupied track ahead of them. They help prevent dispatchers and operators from causing accidents, both by informing them of track occupancy and by preventing signals from displaying unsafe indications.\n\nA track circuit typically has power applied to each rail and a relay coil wired across them. When no train is present, the relay is energised by the current flowing from the power source through the rails. When a train is present, its axles short (shunt) the rails together; the current to the track relay coil drops, and it is de-energised. Circuits through the relay contacts therefore report whether or not the track is occupied.\n\nEach circuit detects a defined section of track, such as a block. These sections are separated by insulated joints, usually in both rails. To prevent one circuit from falsely powering another in the event of insulation failure, the electrical polarity is usually reversed from section to section. Circuits are powered at low voltages (1.5 to 12 V DC). The relays and the power supply are attached to opposite ends of the section to prevent broken rails from electrically isolating part of the track from the circuit. A series resistor limits the current when the track circuit is short-circuited.\n\nIn some railway electrification schemes, one or both of the running rails are used to carry the return current. This prevents use of the basic DC track circuit because the substantial traction currents overwhelm the very small track circuit currents.\n\nWhere DC traction is used on the running line or on tracks in close proximity then DC track circuits cannot be used, similarly if 50 Hz AC electrification is used then 50 Hz AC track circuits cannot be used.\n\nTo accommodate this, AC track circuits use alternating current signals instead of direct current (DC) but typically, the AC frequency is in the range of audio frequencies, from 91 Hz up to 10 kHz. The relays are arranged to detect the selected frequency and to ignore DC and AC traction frequency signals. Again, failsafe principles dictate that the relay interprets the presence of the signal as unoccupied track, whereas a lack of a signal indicates the presence of a train. The AC signal can be coded and locomotives equipped with inductive pickups to create a cab signalling system.\n\nThere are two common approaches to provide a continuous path for traction current that spans multiple track circuit blocks. The simplest method installs insulated track circuit joints on only one of the two rails with the second being a path for the return current and a ground for the track circuit rail. This has the disadvantage of only being able to detect breaks in one rail so the more popular two rail system uses impedance bonds to permit traction current to pass between isolated track circuit blocks while blocking current at track circuit frequencies.\n\nAC circuits are sometimes used in areas where conditions introduce stray currents, which interfere with DC track circuits.\n\nIn some countries, AC-immune DC track circuits are used on AC electrified lines. This is the predominant method of track circuiting on overhead electrified parts of the UK rail network. One method provides 5 V DC to the rails, one of the rails being the traction return and the other being the signal rail. When a relay is energised and attached to the track, normal voltage is 5 V DC. When there is a break in the circuit and there is no train, the voltage rises to 9 V DC which provides a very good means for fault finding. This system filters out the voltage induced in the rails from the overhead lines. These track circuits are limited in length to about 300m.\n\nModern track is often continuously welded, the joints being welded during installation. This offers many benefits to all but the signalling system, which no longer has natural breaks in the rail to form the block sections. The only method to form discrete blocks in this scenario is to use different audio frequencies (AF) in each block section. To prevent the audio signal from one section passing into an adjacent section, pairs of simple tuned circuits are connected across the rails at the section boundary. The tuned circuit often incorporates the circuit to either apply the transmitted signal to the track or recover the received signal from the other end of the section.\n\nConsider a railway with two block sections as in the diagram. Section 1 has frequency A injected at the left-hand end and received at the right-hand end. Section 2 continues from the right hand end of section 1 where frequency B is injected and then received at the right-hand end of section 2.\nThere is often a gap between where frequency A is received and frequency B is injected. This is referred to as a 'tuned zone' and is a section of track where the amplitude of frequency A reduces in the direction of section 2 and the amplitude of frequency B reduces in the direction of section 1. The tuned zone can be of the order of 20 m long.\n\nAdvantages of jointless track circuits:\n\nDisadvantages of jointless track circuits:\n\nCSEE (now Ansaldo STS) UM71 is another kind of jointless track circuit. It uses 1700 Hz and 2300 Hz on one track and 2000 Hz and 2600 Hz on the other. To reduce the chance of stray currents causing a wrong side failure the modulation frequency is calculated by dividing the base frequency by 128. Different rates of modulation can be detected by equipment on the trains and used for ATC, so long as the transmitter end (Tx) is at the front of the train.\n\nThe TI21 and Westinghouse FS2500 jointless track circuits are similar to the UM71.\n\nA jointless track circuit such as the CSEE can be divided with a data pickup unit (DPU), which is cheaper than splitting it into two track circuits. A DPU avoids the need to change the frequency of a whole series of track circuits in a cascade. The DPU consists of a tuned coil which detects the presence or absence of current in the adjacent rail and picks up or drops a relay accordingly. One use of DPUs is for timing circuits. Each track circuit frequency has its own DPU tuned to that frequency. DPUs can be located almost anywhere; they overcome the limitation that jointless tracks have a minimum length.\n\nIn non-electrified areas, DC coded track circuits may be used. These modulate the current going from the powersource end to the relay end and control the signals and cab signals without the need for line wires. The modulated currents can be detected by equipment connected to the track to provide signaling and indication information to activate proper cab signalling if available.\n\nBrands of coded track circuit include:\n\nWhere the length of a section exceeds the practical length of a track circuit, cut tracks can be provided. With a cut track, the relay of the last track cuts the powersource feed of the second last track circuit, and so on. Cut tracks are only suitable for unidirectional tracks.\n\nTrack circuits with ballast contamination will be shorter than those with good ballast, thus needing more cut tracks.\n\nOne common brand of high voltage impulse track (HVIT) circuit is made by Jeumont-Schneider. The high voltage penetrates rust and other problems.\n\nThe HVIT transmits two pulses alternately, a narrow positive one at about 100VDC and a negative broader one at about 30VDC. The energy of the two pulses is the same. At the receiver end a R-C circuit integrates the two pulses which must be of the correct proportions for the relay to pick up. The R-C circuits check that the positive and negative pulses are in correct phase. The two pulses operate at about 1 Hz.\n\nThe circuit will operate on AC and DC electrified lines, with additional equipment.\n\nIn non-electrified areas, insulated blockjoints come in pairs, one on each rail.\n\nIn electrified areas, a workaround is needed to allow the traction current, of the order of thousands of amps, to return to the substation. This may be achieved by having no insulated block joints in one of the rails, called the return rail.\n\nIf both rails are needed to carry the heavy traction return current, then insulated blockjoints are provided in both rails, and impedance bonds are provided to carry the traction current around the insulated joints. Impedance bonds are essentially centre-tapped coils, which offer low impedance to traction current at say 50 Hz, while offering high impedance to signalling current at say 1.7 kHz.\n\nRailway wheels are made from steel and provide a good short circuit from rail to rail (\"shunt resistance\").\n\nLonger trains with more wheels have better conductivity. Short trains or single engines can be a problem. Trains with a single Budd railmotor, which are also lightweight, and with discbrakes, had some problems when they stopped, and had to make a double stop to ensure good contact with the rails.\n\nCast iron brake shoes tend to clean the wheels of non-conductive debris (such as leaves and sand-based traction compounds), while disc brakes do not. As a result, some disc-braked vehicles have \"scrubber pads\" cleaning the wheels to aid in proper track circuit operation.\n\nTrack circuit relays, referred to by signal maintainers as \"vital relays,\" are specially designed to reduce the chance of wrong-side failures. They may, for example, have carbon-silver contacts to reduce the likelihood of the wrong contacts welding shut after power surges and lightning strikes.\n\nThe circuit is designed so the vast majority of failures will cause a \"track occupied\" indication (known as a \"Right Side\" failure in the UK). For example:\n\nOn the other hand, failure modes which prevent the circuit from detecting trains (known as a \"Wrong Side\" failure in the UK) are possible. Examples include:\n\n\nFailure modes that result in an incorrect \"track clear\" signal (known usually in the US as a \"false clear\") may allow a train to enter an occupied block, creating the risk of a collision. Wheel scale and short trains may also be a problem. They may also cause the warning systems at a grade crossing to fail to activate. This is why in UK practice, a treadle is also used in the circuitry.\n\nDifferent means are used to respond to these types of failures. For example, the relays are designed to a very high level of reliability. In areas with electrical problems, different types of track circuits may be used which are less susceptible to interference. Speeds may be restricted when and where fallen leaves are an issue. Traffic may be embargoed in order to let equipment pass which does not reliably shunt the rails.\n\nSabotage is possible. In the 1995 Palo Verde derailment, saboteurs electrically connected sections of rail which they had displaced to conceal the breaks in the track they had made. The track circuit therefore did not detect the breaks, and the engine driver was not given a \"Stop\" indication. Another form of sabotage, not intended to cause a train crash but merely to make trains stop and slow down unnecessarily in an effort to sabotage an economy or potential injuries, is to tie a wire between the 2 rails, causing a false obstruction signal.\n\nThe track circuit relies upon an adequate electrical contact between the rail and the wheel; contamination can insulate the one from the other. A common problem is fallen leaves, though there have been cases where crushed insects have also caused detection failures.\n\nA more persistent problem is rust. Usually the railhead is kept clean of rust by the regular passage of trains' wheels. Lines which are not used regularly can become so rusty as to prevent vehicles being detected; seldom-used points and crossovers and the extremities of terminal platform lines are also prone to rusting. Measures to overcome this include:\n\nInsulated blockjoints can be bridged by wheel scale in some circumstances causing one or two track circuits to fail. This problem may be reduced by having a pair of blockjoints in series about 4m apart. The short 4m section would not itself be track circuited.\n\nElectric locomotives must avoid generating noise in the frequencies that track circuits use. The SNCB Class 13 had such problems.\n\nA short, lightweight and fast train passing over an insulated blockjoint may disappear from the departing track circuit before it appears in the arriving track circuit, allowing false clear signals to be given. This problem can be overcome by introducing a time delay of say 1 – 2 seconds into the departing track circuit. Electronic track circuits such as the CSEE can easily incorporate such a time delay.\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to wire the detectors of a set of points through the track circuit over those points. This can be done in one of two ways:\n\nA simple piece of safety equipment which is carried by all heavy rail trains in Britain is a \"track-circuit operating clip (TCOC)\". This is a length of wire connecting two metal spring clips that clip onto a rail. In the event of accident or obstruction a clip applied to both rails will indicate that that line is occupied, putting the signal for that section to danger.\n\n\"Emergency protection\" procedure in the UK requires TCOCs to be placed on all affected running lines if contact cannot be made immediately with the signaller following an accident where adjacent lines are blocked.\n\nTCOCs are ineffective where train detection is not by means of track circuits, such as axle counters or treadles.\n\nThe first use of track circuiting was by William Robert Sykes on a short stretch of track of the London Chatham and Dover Railway at Brixton in 1864. The failsafe track circuit was invented in 1872 by William Robinson, an American electrical and mechanical engineer. His introduction of a trustworthy method of block occupancy detection was key to the development of the automatic signalling systems now in nearly universal use.\n\nThe first railway signals were manually operated by signal tenders or station agents. When to change the signal aspect was often left to the judgement of the operator. Human error or inattentiveness occasionally resulted in improper signalling and train collisions.\n\nThe introduction of the telegraph during the mid-nineteenth century showed that information could be electrically conveyed over considerable distance, spurring the investigation into methods of electrically controlling railway signals. Although several systems were developed prior to Robinson's, none could automatically respond to train movements.\n\nRobinson first demonstrated a fully automatic railway signalling system in model form in 1870. A full-sized version was subsequently installed on the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad at Ludlow, Pennsylvania (aka Kinzua, PA), where it proved to be practical. His design consisted of electrically operated discs located atop small trackside signal huts, and was based on an open track circuit. When no train was within the block no power was applied to the signal, indicating a clear track.\n\nAn inherent weakness of this arrangement was that it could fail in an unsafe state. For example, a broken wire in the track circuit would falsely indicate that no train was in the block, even if one was. Recognizing this, Robinson devised the closed loop track circuit described above, and in 1872, installed it in place of the previous circuit. The result was a fully automatic, failsafe signalling system that was the prototype for subsequent development.\n\nAlthough a pioneer in the use of signals controlling trains, the UK was slow to adopt Robinson's design. At the time, many carriages on UK railways had wooden axles and/or wheels with wooden hubs, making them incompatible with track circuits.\n\nNumerous accidents would have been prevented by the provision of track circuits, including:\n\n\nMuch rarer are accidents caused when the track circuits themselves fail. For example:\n\nBecause Track circuits operate by passing a current through one or both of the tracks, they can sometimes detect if a rail has broken completely. However, if the break is only partial or is at a turnout (set of points) detection may not be possible.\n\n\n"}

It is approximately eight miles upstream of Bloomington, Maryland, and approximately five miles north of Elk Garden, West Virginia.\n\nThe lake was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), as authorized by the Flood Control Act of October 23, 1962 (Public Law 87-874) and is described in House Document No. 469, 87th United States Congress, second session. Originally named \"Bloomington Dam\", it was renamed Jennings Randolph Lake in 1987 to honor the US Senator from West Virginia who was instrumental in this and many other water resource projects across the nation. Construction of the lake was completed in 1981, and resulted in the flooding of the community of Shaw, West Virginia and the realignment of West Virginia Route 46. The dam, rolled earth and rock fill, is 296 feet high, has a crest length of 2,130 feet and contains 10 million cubic yards of material. Jennings Randolph Lake strives to provide water quality improvements and reduce flood damages downstream of the lake, provide a source of water supply for downstream municipalities and industries, and provide the public with recreation opportunities. With a full conservation pool, the lake, controls a drainage area of 263 square miles, and is about 5.5 miles long and has a surface area of 952 acres. The lake, which serves as an emergency reservoir for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, is managed by the Corps of Engineers. Coordination of the lake's use for water supply purposes is managed by the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB).\n\nThe impoundment also collects acid mine drainage from coal mines located upstream, which improves the water quality of the river downstream.\n\nIn 2008 Fairlawn Hydroelectric Company filed a proposal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to construct a hydroelectric facility at the dam. FERC approved a license for a 14 MW facility on April 30, 2012. In 2016, Fairlawn Hydroelectric reported that it had not yet obtained construction permits from USACE, and it obtained an extension of time from FERC to begin and complete the project.\n\n"}

The genus \"Strombus\" was named by Swedish Naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Around 50 living species were recognized, which vary in size from fairly small to very large. Six species live in the greater Caribbean region, including the queen conch, \"Strombus gigas\" (now usually known as \"Eustrombus gigas\" or \"Lobatus gigas\"), and the West Indian fighting conch, \"Strombus pugilis\". However, since 2006, many species have been assigned to discrete genera. These new genera are, however, not yet found in most textbooks and collector's guides.\n\nWorldwide, several of the larger species are economically important as food sources; these include the endangered queen conch, which very rarely also produces a pink, gem-quality pearl.\n\nIn the geological past, a much larger number of species of \"Strombus\" existed. Fossils of species within this genus have been found all over the world in sediments from Cretaceous to Quaternary (age range: 140.2 million years ago to recent).\n\nOf the living species, most are in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Many species of true conchs live on sandy bottoms among beds of sea grass in tropical waters. They eat algae and have a claw-shaped operculum.\n\nLike almost all shelled gastropods, conches have spirally constructed shells. Again, as is normally the case in many gastropods, this spiral shell growth is usually right-handed, but on very rare occasions it can be left-handed.\n\nTrue conches have long eye stalks, with colorful ring-marked eyes at the tips. The shell has a long and narrow aperture, and a short siphonal canal, with another indentation near the anterior end called a stromboid notch. This notch is where one of the two eye stalks protrudes from the shell.\n\nThe true conch has a foot ending in a pointed, sickle-shaped, operculum, which can be dug into the substrate as part of an unusual \"leaping\" locomotion.\n\nTrue conches grow a flared lip on their shells only upon reaching sexual maturity. This is called an alated outer lip or alation.\n\nConches lay eggs in long strands; the eggs are contained in twisted, gelatinous tubes. \"Strombus\" moves with a leaping motion.\n\n\"Strombus\" shells have a flaring outer lip with a notch near the anterior end called the stromboid notch through which the animal can protrude one of its stalked eyes.\n\nThe phylogenetic relationships among the Strombidae have been mainly accessed in two different occasions, using two distinct methods. In a 2005 monograph, Simone proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) based on an extensive morphoanatomical analysis of representatives of the Aporrhaidae, Strombidae, Xenophoridae, and Struthiolariidae. However, according to Simone, only \"Strombus gracilior\", \"Strombus alatus\", and \"Strombus pugilis\", the type species, remained within \"Strombus\". In Simone's cladogram, these three species constituted a distinct group based on at least five synapomorphies (traits that are shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor). The remaining taxa were previously considered as subgenera, and were elevated to genus level by Simone in the end of his analysis.\n\nIn a different approach, Latiolais and colleagues (2006) proposed another cladogram that attempts to show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 species in the genus \"Strombus\" and three species in the allied genus \"Lambis\". The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) protein-coding gene regions. In this proposed phylogeny, \"Strombus pugilis\", \"Strombus alatus\", \"Strombus granulatus\" and \"Strombus gracilior\" are closely related and appear to share a common ancestor.\n\nThis genus of sea snails used to comprise about 50 species, 38 of them occurring in the Indo-Pacific region.

She became the wife of Gu, Prince of Korea. The two were never legally married in accordance with Korean custom, and thus Mullock was not included in the registry of the Lee Family Council. Due to her exclusion from the registry, Mullock later had trouble finalizing her divorce in the United States from Prince Gu. The exclusion of Mullock from the registry also means that her being a member of the Korean Imperial Household is disputed.\n\nBorn in the United States, Mullock came from a Ukrainian American family. Mullock was working in the architectural practice of IM Pei when Prince Gu, a recent graduate of MIT with a degree in architecture, joined the New York City firm. Tired of her work at IM Pei, she decided to immigrate to Spain. Mullock taped an advertisement of the notice board of her office for her apartment. Prince Gu saw the notice, visited her apartment, and instead of purchasing it, he persuaded Mullock to stay in the United States. Mullock was said to be “deeply moved” by Prince Gu when he spoke a few clumsy Ukrainian phrases he knew in an attempt to impress her.\n\nIn 1958, Mullock met Prince Gu's parents, Prince Eun and Princess Bangja. In May 1958, Mullock and Prince Gu were engaged, and they married at the Ukrainian St George's Church in New York City on October 25, 1959. \n\nIn 1963, Mullock moved to Korea with her husband. Mullock and Prince Gu moved into apartments at Changdeok Palace. As a member of the Korean Imperial Household, Mullock devoted her time to charitable endeavors in her new homeland. Mullock opened a clothing store whilst in Korea to help finance her charitable endeavors. This was a time which Mullock called \"the happiest times of my life\". A cousin-in-law of Mullock said “Mullock fulfilled her duty as a princess of Korea’s last royal family, helping the needy and poor, particularly the handicapped people.\" Mullock continued her charitable activities for many years after the end of her marriage. \n\nThough unable to have children with Prince Gu, Mullock did adopt a daughter with her husband, Eugenia Unsuk Lee in 1969. Their adoptive daughter was born in 1959 in Seoul. Eugenia Unsuk Lee was never formally recognized by the Lee Family Council and therefore her being a member of the Korean Imperial Household is disputed.\n\nPrince Gu divorced Mullock in 1982 under pressure from the imperial family, as she had produced no heir. Mullock being an official member of the Korean Imperial Household is disputed, this is due to her discovery of her exclusion from the register of the Lee Family Council. Her exclusion became known to her when in the process of finalizing her divorce from Prince Gu in the United States.\n\nIn 1995, Mullock left Korea for Hawaii. On May 1, 2005, she attended religious ceremonies at the Royal Ancestors' Shrine (\"Jomngmyo Jerye\") with Mrs Gwon Heesun, her lady-in-waiting, and Princess Lee Haewon, a daughter of Prince Gang of Korea.\n\nPrince Gu, her former husband, who divided his time between Japan, where he worked, and his homeland of Korea, died of a heart attack in 2005. \n\nMullock passed away at Hale Nani Rehabilitation & Nursing Center in Honolulu, Hawaii on November 26, 2017. Mullock was survived by her adoptive daughter, Eugenia Unsuk Lee who continues to live in Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1992278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992278", "title": "Hillsborough High School (Tampa, Florida)", "text": "Hillsborough High School (Tampa, Florida)\n\nHillsborough High School is a public high school located at 5000 N. Central Ave, in the heart of the historic Seminole Heights neighborhood, in Tampa, Florida. Hillsborough High is the oldest public high school in Hillsborough County, Florida.\n\nHillsborough High is one of four Hillsborough county public high schools with an International Baccalaureate program.\n\nHillsborough High School is one of the South's oldest high schools. Although mystery surrounded the beginning of the school for many decades, in 2003 discovered documents preserved in the cornerstone of the HHS building of 1911 have confirmed that the school had its first students in 1882, and graduated its first class of four students in 1886 (Class of 1885–1886). Mrs. Mary Cuscaden was the first Principal. One of the 1886 diplomas is preserved in the school's vault. Until a second High School was opened, the school's correct name was \"The Hillsborough County High School\". The first new HHS building was funded out of the savings from the general school fund. After the freeze of 1895, by careful management, money was saved and the first county high school was erected. At a contract price of $5,100 (equivalent to $,000 in 2019), a well-planned, two-story wooden building with science laboratories, a library and an auditorium was built large enough to accommodate as many as 250 high school students. Once the first free standing HHS school location was out grown, a new home was sought, which is now referred to as the Old Hillsborough High School, to replace it, and was built in 1911 on a design by Wilson Potter of New York. It was expanded in 1923 according to designs by M. Leo Elliott. Hillsborough High School moved into its present-day home, a gothic architectural design by Francis J. Kennard, which was completed and has been the school's home since 1928.\n\nB.C. Graham, one of the first teachers was also the third principal, and the first graduating class of four students was in 1886, under Principal Graham. One of the oldest traditions is the wearing of red and black, the school's colors, every Friday to show spirit and unity. Hillsborough has many illustrious alumni, some of whom have served as State Attorney, senators, judges, state representatives, mayors, professional athletes, educators, scholars, and other professions.\nAmong the many illustrious alumni is a Medal of Honor recipient, 1st Lt. Baldomero Lopez USMC.\n\nHillsborough produced the first high school newspaper in Florida in 1889, \"The Red & Black\", and the first yearbook in Florida, \"The Hillsborean\", in 1911.\n\nThe alma mater, \"The Red and Black\", was written in 1923. In 1931, Hillsborough High became the first home of the University of Tampa, established by Frederic Spaulding in 1931 as Tampa Junior College. In 1933, University Of Tampa moved to its current home in the old Tampa Bay Hotel, now named Plant Hall. In 1949, HHS students purchased the clock for the clock tower, in honor of Hillsborough's veteran casualties in World War II. The names of Hillsborough alumni, who were killed in action during the war were placed on a plaque under the tower. The Terrier Creed was written by the Class of 1957; it received much publicity as the only one of its kind in the South. The bronze terrier that guards the trophy case was originally placed in the courtyard by the Class of 1958. The sacred \"H\" on the patio was dedicated in 1964 in honor of Mr. Hamilton, an assistant principal. HHS students from different graduating classes raised the funds, providing the stained glass windows in the auditorium in 1963.\n\nOver the years, Hillsborough High School, garnered some nicknames. \"Harvard on the Hill\" stems partly from the fact that Hillsborough High School was built on one of the highest geographical elevations in Tampa, had graduated many illustrious people, and emulated many of Harvard's traditions with regard to its \"alma mater\" and school color scheme, a crimson shade of red and black, and the big letter \"H\". Historically, the colors red and black represent heart and soul. Later, Hillsborough High also picked up the nickname \"Peyton Place,\" probably sometime in the late 1960s or early 1970s, because the opening scene of the tower in the popular \"Peyton Place\" television soap opera somehow reminded some individuals of Hillsborough High's clock tower, and also because as one teacher put it, \"it seemed there was always some sort of soap opera going on at the school.\"\n\nOn September 5, 1996, during a campaign for re-election, the 42nd U.S. President, Bill Clinton, spoke at Hillsborough High School about national education policy and \"other\" family issues, addressing students. President Clinton was originally scheduled to visit during the summer sessions, but had to cancel because of hurricane warnings. Student Council President Erica Allen, warmly greeted President Clinton, the two shook hands, and Erica received a hug from the President, just before Clinton's speech to the student body. HHS received national attention because of President Clinton's visit.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Hillsborough High went through a massive renovation. The school's students, faculty and staff were forced to temporarily move out and hold double session classes with other schools for the 1975-76 school year. . Hillsborough High 10th-grade students attended the afternoon session at George Washington Junior High at 2704 N. Highland Avenue, the same building originally built for HHS in 1911. 11th and 12th graders and staff were forced into the afternoon session at the new Thomas Jefferson High School at 4401 W. Cypress St until renovations of today's HHS building (built 1927–1928), were completed in 1976. The Class of 1977 was the first graduating class in the newly remodeled HHS Campus.\n\nIn 1979, HHS students had to pay for the chimes in the HHS clock tower. In 1980, a plaque was donated by the class of 1980, and mounted over the doorway leading to the inner courtyard from the trophy case area of the main building dedicated to the classes of the 1980s and \"the Decade of New Ideas.\" During the early 1980s, HHS's student population swelled to over 3,000 students, spanning two campuses, referred to as North and South Campuses. HHS's South Campus included all of the buildings which now comprise Memorial Middle School, adjacent to HHS on its south side.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Alumni Building, commonly referred to as the 400 Hall, was added to the school. In around 1995, another addition was made, the 500 Building/English Hall, in which most 10th grade homerooms and English classes are housed.\n\nOn May 3, 2008, HHS completed renovations to restore the high school to its pre-1960s luster, when it reopened its newly named gymnasium. In 2005, many classes were forced into portable classrooms during the renovation. The major improvements to HHS were divided between maintenance and restoration.\n\nStudent Demographics:\nHillsborough High School serves a multi-ethnic school population that currently consists of 1956 students from a diverse, rich historical community.\n\nHillsborough High has several sports teams, including football, baseball, girls flag football, boys and girls basketball, boys and girls track and field, boys and girls cross country, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls tennis, boys and girls swimming and diving, boys golf, boys wrestling, and girls volleyball. There used to be boys decathlon and girls pentathlon, but the sport was discontinued by the FHSAA.\n\nThe first football team was in 1907. Football was the first competitive high school sport played in Florida. The five schools in the initial football league were Duval (Jacksonville), Hillsborough (Tampa), Ocala, Orlando and Summerlin Institute (Bartow). Only Hillsborough still exists. The FHSAA -Florida High School Athletic Association was not formed until 1920.\n\nThe team's football field is named after Marcelino Huerta. The field was renamed from \"Gaither Field\", for Principal Vivian Gaither, when Gaither High School was opened in Tampa. The team's biggest rival is Plant, and used to be St. Pete and Duval.\n\nOn Friday, August 31, 2007, the Hillsborough High School football team celebrated its 100th-anniversary season opener with a 43–20 victory over Jefferson High School.\n\n\nThe team won the state championship in 1910, 1912*, 1914, 1919, 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929**, 1935, 1942, 1945, 1946, 1948.\n\nThe 1913 team included Rex Farrior, Rammy Ramsdell, and Rondo Hatton. The team was the runner-up to Lakeland in 1923, with a team that featured Dutch Stanley and Speedy Walker. The 1926 team included Carlos Proctor and Jimmy Steele. In 1929, Hillsborough won the high school national football championship.\n\nThe team won the state championship in 1935, 1937, and 1967 (2A). In 1913 and 1914, Hillsborough's basketball and baseball teams defeated teams from the University of Florida and Southern College.\n\nThe 2008 renovations included a new gymnasium. Hillsborough High's gym had previously been famously and affectionately known to students and alums as the \"Big Red Barn\", more commonly \"The Barn\" probably due in part to its architectural design: its steep \"skylighted\" roof and red brick facade cause the gym to resemble a barn from a distance. \"The Barn\" was known for being a hostile environment for Terrier opponents to compete in, for the HHS student body seldom stood for anything short of winning. \"The Barn\" was one of the harshest gyms in the county to play in, as there was no air conditioning in it for many years. That, coupled with the loud fans and the many talented Terrier teams opposing schools had to face made \"the Barn\" a very difficult place to come out of with a win, much to the delight of generations of Hillsborough fans.\n\nOn May 3, 2008, a ceremony was held in Hillsborough High's newly remodeled gym to dedicate the gym, naming it; the Don Williams Athletic Center, in honor of former HHS boys basketball coach Don Williams, who led the Terriers to a 2A state championship in 1959. Coach Williams went on to become the first South Florida Bulls men's basketball coach in 1970–71. Coach Williams was notified of the dedication prior to his death in February 2008.\n\nThe boys team won the state championships in 1924, 1947 (A), and 1959 (2A).\n\nThe boys track and field won the team state championship in 1916, 1929, 1949 (A), and 1950 (A).\n\nThe boys decathlon won the state team championships in 1981 (4A), 1982 (4A), and 1983 (4A). The girls pentathlon won the state team championships in 1982 (4A) and 1983 (4A).\n\nThe golf team won the state team championships in 1928 and 1934.\n\nThe boys swim and dive team won the state team championship in 1946.\n\n\n"}

He was a top star on the Canadian prairies, named a WCHL All-Star four times in five seasons. He transferred to the NHL in 1926 when the Rosebuds were sold to the rival league and went on to score the first goal in the history of the Chicago Black Hawks. He retired in 1933 after several seasons with the Red Wings. Hay was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.\n\nHay was born in Listowel, Ontario but moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba at an early age. He and childhood friend Dick Irvin were teammates on the Winnipeg Monarchs when they played junior, but Hay left hockey for three years to serve with the Canadian Forestry Corps during World War I.\n\nReturning from the war, Hay settled in Regina, Saskatchewan and played two seasons with the Regina Victorias of the Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League between 1919 and 1921. He then joined the Regina Capitals and began his professional career in the WCHL. In four years in Regina, he was named a league First-Team All-Star three times. Hay remained with the team after it relocated to become the Portland Rosebuds in 1925, and was named an All-Star for the fourth time in 1925–26. When the league collapsed in 1926, the Rosebuds were sold in their entirety to the NHL and became the Chicago Black Hawks.\n\nHay joined the team in Chicago for the 1926–27 NHL season, and on November 17, 1926 scored the first goal in the history of the Black Hawks. He completed the season in Chicago but was traded, along with Percy Traub, to the Detroit Cougars in exchange for $15,000 after its conclusion. Hay played his finest NHL season in 1927–28, leading the team in goals and points, and was named to an unofficial all-star team by the league's managers. He played seven seasons in the Detroit organization, and retired one game into the 1933–34 season to take over as the coach of their minor league team, the Detroit Olympics, whom he spent three years with before leaving the game.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958, and has been honoured by the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. He was considered one of the best stickhandlers in the game during his time in the NHL.\n\nFollowing his hockey career, Hay worked in insurance until the outbreak of World War II. He served as a flight-lieutenant and instructor with the Royal Canadian Air Force until the conclusion of the war, after which he returned to his insurance business. He retired in 1965 and lived quietly until his death in Stratford, Ontario ten years later.\n"}

They join LAMI's topsail schooners the \"Swift of Ipswich\" and the \"Bill of Rights.\" The boats are named for sail training pioneers Irving and Electa \"Exy\" Johnson.\n\nThe brigantines are based on original plans designed in the 1930s by Henry Gruber but never built. Noted yacht designer W.I.B. Crealock was brought in to adapt the plans to meet modern Coast Guard regulations and to fit LAMI's own stringent specifications based on their years of trial and experience. Master shipbuilder Allan Rawl was retained to oversee the project.\n\nWith the arrival of a truckload of South American Purpleheart hardwood for the keel in 2000, the Twin Brigantine project began in the parking lot adjacent to LAMI. The hulls were built in public, and framed out with American White oak and fastened with bronze. Launched on 27 April 2002, they were proclaimed as the \"Official Tall Ship Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles\" by Mayor James Hahn and witnessed by one of their namesakes, Exy Johnson, before motoring out to a fitting-out berth where the interiors were finished and completed as their masts stepped, rigged and sails bent on.

It is held annually, with the final contested in September. The current champions of the Chatham Cup are Birkenhead United, who defeated Western Suburbs on penalties (1–1 after extra time) in the 2018 final.\n\nThe Chatham Cup is contested by teams from throughout New Zealand, and has been held annually since 1923 with the exception of 1937 and 1941–44. Typically between 120 and 150 teams take part, with extra time and penalty shoot-outs used to decide matches which end in ties. In the past, replays were used, and in the early years of the competition the number of corners won during a game decided tied matches.\n\nThe cup itself was gifted to the then New Zealand Football Association in 1922 by the crew of HMS \"Chatham\" as a token of appreciation for the hospitality they had encountered on a visit to New Zealand. The actual trophy is modelled on the FA Cup.\n\nThe most successful teams in the Chatham Cup have been Mount Wellington (seven wins, two of them since amalgamation with Auckland University), and Christchurch United and North Shore United (six wins each). Most of the competition's winners have come from the main centres of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, though teams from Dunedin, Hamilton, Nelson, and Napier have also won the competition, and the inaugural champions were from the small settlement of Seacliff, with many of the team being staff from the nearby psychiatric hospital.\n\nMany of the early winners of the competition no longer exist, as competition were not effectively organised in New Zealand until the advent of a national league in 1970, and still remains largely amateur to this day. Many early New Zealand clubs have amalgamated with their neighbours or disbanded.\n\nPrior to 1970, the final was held between the winners of separate North Island and South Island tournaments, with national semi-finals often being referred to as \"Island finals\". In the early years of the competition, each regional association found its own champion to represent that region in the Chatham Cup, leading to confusion in many of the early records with regional finals, island finals, and the national final all often simply being referred to in contemporary reports as \"finals\". Further confusion is caused by the incomplete nature of many of the early competition records. It is only since the first publication of an annual New Zealand football yearbook in 1965 that any systematic record-keeping began to take place; earlier match reports and statistics are complete only inasmuch as the vagaries of newspaper sports reporting allow.\n\nEarly Chatham Cup competitions were not well supported by the clubs, and the regulations surrounding entry to the competition were often financially prohibitive. The clubs themselves received only a tiny percentage of the money made in gate takings, and often had to travel considerably further to play matches than they did in the provincial leagues in which they competed. Concerns as to the costs involved and the limited financial support from the NZFA for entrants in the competition led to some teams disbanding as a result of the debts incurred, notably early winners Harbour Board, and the competition itself was so poorly supported by clubs as a result that it barely survived its first few seasons. Only some 30 clubs entered each of the first few years of the competition, despite over 450 clubs being registered with the country's football administration in 1924; South Island participation in particular was poor, with only a handful of teams entering in the first few years, and the 1937 Cup was cancelled after only twelve teams nationwide registered entries.\n\nDespite this, large crowds often came to watch the matches, indicating their popularity with the public. The Wellington regional final in 1924 was played before a crowd of 1500 spectators, one in sixty of Wellington's population at the time, and the 1928 national final was watched by a crowd of 6000.\n\nSupport for the competition among clubs has gained momentum since travel has become easier around the country and the financial regulation of the competition have been eased. Since World War II it has been typical for 100 to 150 teams to enter the competition.\n\nSince the 1960s tournaments have been organised with a preliminary round and (occasionally) a qualifying round, four or five rounds proper, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final. Competition begins in April, and the final is normally played in September. Early rounds are held on a regional basis, between teams within the country's three competition regions (northern North Island, southern North Island, South Island). Different publications often list different numbers for the rounds, making for some confusion as to whether the round before the quarter-finals is the fourth or fifth round in any particular year.\n\nBetween 1970 and 2003, when a national league was run between the country's top clubs, national league teams received byes to later stages of the cup competition. The current New Zealand Football Championship, which replaced this league, is contested between franchise teams rather than traditional clubs, and these franchise teams do not compete in the Chatham Cup. There is currently no formal system of byes to later rounds (as there is, for example, in the FA Cup). Several top sides do, however, gain byes through to the second round.\n\nFrom 1986–1988, the final was contested on a two-match home and away series, but in other years the final has been a single match. In 1952, the final finished 1–1, and the title was shared. A replay was used to decide the 1970, 1972 and 1983 finals, and penalty shoot-outs decided the 1990 and 2001 finals.\n\nThe 2006 Chatham Cup final was played on 2 September 2006. It was contested by Eastern Suburbs (Auckland) and Western Suburbs FC (Wellington). Western Suburbs FC won 3–0 in a penalty shootout after both teams were scoreless in normal and extra times. In the semi-finals, Eastern Suburbs defeated defending champions Central United of Auckland 5–3 on penalties after scores were level at 3–3 after extra time, and Western Suburbs FC comprehensively beat Dunedin-based side Caversham 4–0.\n\nThe quarter finals of the 2007 Chatham Cup were played in late July. In these matches, Caversham beat Nomads United (Christchurch), Central United (Auckland) defeated Eastern Suburbs (Auckland), North Shore United beat Hamilton Wanderers, and Western Suburbs FC (Wellington) beat Miramar Rangers. The semi-finals, played in mid-August, saw Central United beat North Shore United 3–1 in Auckland and Western Suburbs FC beat Caversham by the same margin in Dunedin.\n\nThe 2007 Chatham Cup final was played on 2 September 2007 in Auckland. Central United (Auckland) won by 10–9 on penalties after extra time.\n\nThe quarter finals of the 2008 Chatham Cup were played over the weekend of 19–20 July. in these matches, Dunedin Technical beat Miramar Rangers, East Coast Bays (Auckland) beat Waitakere City, Glenfield Rovers beat Central United (Auckland), and Nelson Suburbs beat Western Suburbs FC (Wellington). Surprisingly, only one of the four semi-finalists had ever previously reached that stage (Dunedin Technical, who won the cup in 1999). This also meant that two South Island sides had made the semi-finals for the first time in over a decade. In the semi-finals, held in mid-August, East Coast Bays beat Nelson Suburbs 2–1, and Dunedin Technical beat Glenfield Rovers 3–2.\n\nIn the final, held on 13 September, East Coast Bays beat Dunedin Technical 1–0, to take the Chatham Cup for 2008.\n\nThe quarter finals of the 2009 Chatham Cup were played in late July. In these matches, Three Kings United beat Caversham, Wellington Olympic defeated Forrest Hill Milford, Manurewa beat Nelson Suburbs, and Miramar Rangers beat Waitakere City. The semi-finals, played on 30 August, saw Wellington Olympic beat Manurewa 2–0 in Wellington and Three Kings United beat Miramar Rangers 2–1 in Auckland.\n\nThe 2009 Chatham Cup final was played on 20 September 2009 at North Harbour Stadium, North Shore City. Wellington Olympic came back from being 1–0 down to Three Kings United after three minutes to win their first Chatham Cup by two goals to one.\n\nThe quarter finals of the 2010 Chatham Cup were played in late July. In these matches, Bay Olympic beat Forrest Hill Milford, East Coast Bays defeated Glenfield Rovers, Miramar Rangers beat Wellington United, and Caversham scored four times in extra time to beat Ferrymead Bays 7–3. The semi-finals, played in mid-August, saw Bay Olympic beat Caversham on penalties after a 3–3 draw in Dunedin and Miramar Rangers beat East Coast Bays 2–1 in Wellington.\n\nThe 2010 Chatham Cup final was played on 12 September 2010 at North Harbour Stadium, North Shore City. Miramar Rangers led Bay Olympic from the 12th minute, gaining their fourth title by three goals to one.\n\nThe quarter finals of the 2011 Chatham Cup were played on 24 July, with wins to Caversham, Napier City Rovers, Wairarapa United and Bay Olympic over Onehunga Sports, Manurewa, Waitakere City, and Dunedin Technical respectively. The closest of these was the Olympic-Technical match, which went to a penalty shoot-out after finishing 3–3 after extra time. In the semi-finals, Napier City Rovers came back from conceding an early goal to beat Caversham 2–1 in Napier, and Wairarapa United travelled to Auckland where they beat hosts Bay Olympic 1–0.\n\nThe 2011 Chatham Cup final was played on 28 August 2011 at Memorial Park, Palmerston North, as both teams were from the lower North Island. It was the first time that city had ever held the final. Final debutants Wairarapa United scored early, with Napier City Rovers equalising early in the second half. Wairarapa's winner came just four minutes from the end of the match.\n\n\n\nThe Bob Smith Memorial Trophy is traditionally awarded to the runners-up in the Chatham Cup, though this has not always been the case, notably in the years 1982 to 1997, when the trophy's location was unknown. Details of each year's runners-up can be found in the individual articles on each year's competition.\n\nA Jack Batty Memorial Cup is presented annually to the player adjudged to have made to most positive impact in the Chatham Cup final. The trophy honours Jack Batty, who was both a member of the crew of HMS \"Chatham\" and also a three-time medallist in the early days of the tournament with Harbour Board, Tramways, and Tramurewa. The cup was donated by his son, John Batty, himself a Chatham Cup winner with Blockhouse Bay in 1970, and was first awarded to Greg Brown of Napier City Rovers in 1985.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1992401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992401", "title": "Ruben I, Prince of Armenia", "text": "Ruben I, Prince of Armenia\n\nRuben I, (), also Roupen I or Rupen I, (1025/1035 – Kormogolo, 1095) was the first lord of Armenian Cilicia or “Lord of the Mountains” (1080/1081/1082 – 1095). He declared the independence of Cilicia from the Byzantine Empire, thus formally founding the beginning of Armenian rule there. The Roupenian dynasty ruled Cilician Armenia until 1219.\n\nThe Armenian voluntary immigrations into the Byzantine Empire began as early as the 6th century; from the reign of Emperor Maurice (582–602) onwards they were solidly incorporated into the military fabric of the Byzantine army. The Armenian migration to the south-west, began when the Seldjuk invasions made life in the Araxes valley and by Lake Van no longer secure. By the mid 10th century, large numbers of Armenian settlements were well underway in Cilicia.\n\nGreater Armenia was ruled by the Bagratids in relative peace and prosperity from the 9th century until 1045 when their capital city of Ani fell. In 1045, King Gagik II was invited to Constantinople; upon arrival there, he was taken captive and under duress was forced to abdicate his throne and relinquish all his right in Armenia in exchange for lands in Cappadocia. Thus Ani was relinquished to Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos who began the resettlement of large numbers of Armenians in Byzantine Cilicia. Gagik was killed by Byzantine orders in 1079, after his own peculiarly atrocious murder of the Archbishop of Caesarea (today \"Kayseri\" in Turkey).\n\nThe Seldjuks also played a significant role in the Armenian immigration into Cilicia. In 1071, Sultan Alp Arslan put an end to Byzantine dominance in the east with his most convincing victory at the battle on the plains of Manzikert, where Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes was taken captive.\n\nThe consensus appears to be that the Roupenians were the descendant of the Bagratids, and Roupen was a relative of the last Bagratid king, Gagik II. The Armenian chronicler Kirakos Gandzaketsi speaks of the Roupenians as ‘the sons and descendants of Gagik Artsruni’. Another Armenian chronicler, Vahram, a personal secretary of King Levon II refers to Roupen as ‘a famous chief of the blood royal, Rouben by name’. On the other hand, the claims in these primary sources of a family relationship with the kings of the Bagratid dynasty are implausible. It is felt that, if such a connection had existed, the sources would have given specific details, given the otherwise reasonably complete genealogies which can be reconstructed from the information which they contain.\n\nRoupen, according to the general consensus of the Armenian chroniclers, was a commander in the king’s armies. After the surrender of Ani to Constantine IX, a number of King Gagik II’s princes and loyal adherents, among them Roupen faithfully followed the king’s court into exile and resettled in the district of Caesarea in Cappadocia. However upon the murder of Gagik II, Roupen gathered his family and fled to the Taurus Mountains and took refuge in the fortress of Kopitar (Kosidar) situated north of Sis (today \"Kozan\" in Turkey). The territory of the Armenians in the Taurus was hard of access and easy to defend.\n\nRoupen declared the independence of Cilicia from the Byzantine Empire in 1080. Relying mostly upon what was left of the loyal followers of King Gagik, he developed enough strength to descend gradually towards the heartland of the Cilician plain. He began leading bold and successful military campaigns against the Byzantines, and on one occasion he culminated his venture with the capture of the fortress of Pardzerpert (today \"Andırın\" in Turkey) which became a stronghold of the Roupenian dynasty.\n\nAt that time, Roupen was outshone by the Armenian Vahram, called Philaretus by the Greeks. Philaretus’ dominion stretched from Tarsus to the lands beyond the river Euphrates; and Roupen became his vassal. They jointly expanded northward and eastward.\n\nIn 1086, Malik Shah I conquered much of northern Syria and eastern Anatolia where he installed new governors who levied repressive taxes on the Armenian inhabitants. Thus the sufferings endured by the Armenians at the hands of the Seljuks became the impetus for many of the Armenians to seek refuges and sanctuaries in Byzantine Anatolia and Cilicia throughout the second half of the 11th century.\n\nBy 1090, Roupen was growing old; his command seems to have then passed entirely to his son Constantine, who in the same year conquered the strategic Cilician castle of Vahka (today \"Feke\" in Turkey).\n\nRoupen died at the age of 70 (or 60); he was buried at the monastery of Castalon.\n\nThe name of Roupen’s wife is unknown. His recorded children are:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1992406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992406", "title": "Jazz piano", "text": "Jazz piano\n\nJazz piano is a collective term for the techniques pianists use when playing jazz. The piano has been an integral part of the jazz idiom since its inception, in both solo and ensemble settings. Its role is multifaceted due largely to the instrument's combined melodic and harmonic capabilities. For this reason it is an important tool of jazz musicians and composers for teaching and learning jazz theory and set arrangement, regardless of their main instrument. (By extension the phrase 'jazz piano' can refer to similar techniques on any keyboard instrument.)\n\nAlong with the guitar, vibraphone, and other keyboard instruments, the piano is one of the instruments in a jazz combo that can play both single notes and chords rather than only single notes as does the saxophone or trumpet.\n\nA new style known as “stride” or “Harlem stride” emerged during the 1920s, predominantly in New York. James P. Johnson was a prominent adherent. The left hand was used to establish rhythm while the right hand improvised melodies.\n\nMastering the various chord voicings—simple to advanced—is the first building block of learning jazz piano. Jazz piano technique uses all the chords found in Western art music, such as major, minor, augmented, diminished, seventh, diminished seventh, sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, suspended fourth, and so on. A second key skill is learning to play with a swing rhythm and \"feel\". In jazz, the roots are usually omitted from keyboard voicings, as this task is left to the double bass player. Jazz pianists also make extensive use of chord \"extensions\", such as adding the ninth, eleventh or thirteenth scale degree to the chord. In some cases, these extensions may be \"altered\" i.e. sharpened or flattened, as in the case of a \"sharp 11\" chord.\n\nThe next step is learning to improvise melodic lines using scales and chord tones. This ability is perfected after long experience, including much practice, which internalizes the physical skills of playing and the technical elements of harmony, and it requires a great natural 'ear' for extemporaneous music-making. When jazz pianists improvise, they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz piano. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised \"by ear\" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play \"by ear.\" Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and guitar players, bebop-era jazz pianists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios.\n\nJazz piano (the technique) and the instrument itself offer soloists an exhaustive number of choices. One may play the bass register in an ostinato pattern, popular in boogie-woogie style, where the left hand repeats a phrase numerous times throughout a song, as performed by Rob Agerbeek in \"Boogie Woogie Stomp.\" The left hand can also be played as a melodic counterline that emulates the walking of an upright bass. In stride piano, (similar to the earlier ragtime) the left hand rapidly plays alternate positions between notes in the bass register and chords in the tenor register, while the right hand plays melody and improvises, as performed in George Gershwin's \"Liza\". The right hand may play melodic lines, or harmonic content, chordally or in octaves. It may also be played in lockstep with the left hand, using a double melody block chord called \"locked-hand\" voicing, or Shearing voicing—a technique popularized, though not invented, by the pianist and set leader George Shearing.\n\nJazz piano has played a leading role in developing the sound of jazz. Early on, black jazz musicians created ragtime on the piano. As the genre progressed the piano was usually featured in the rhythm section of a band, which was typically configured as one or more of piano, guitar, bass, or drums, or other instruments, such as the vibraphone.\n\nOver time, playing piano-accompaniment in ensemble sets, and then bands, changed from primarily time-keeping (consisting of repetitive left-hand figures) to a more flexible role. Ultimately, the skilled pianist was free both to lead and to answer the instrumental soloist, using both short and sustained, chordal and melodic, fragments—a technique known as 'comping'. Good comping musicians were capable of many and different chord voicings, so to match the various moods the different soloists were aiming for. In the early days not all leading pianists were concerned to provide comping. Others—notably Duke Ellington, who became famous during the Harlem Renaissance at the Cotton Club—earned great esteem among band members as well as other musicians. Ellington comped enthusiastically in support of the soloist and did much to develop the technique.\n\nJazz piano moved away from playing lead melody to providing foundation for song sets; soon, skilled jazz pianists were performing as soloists. In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of great piano players emerged. Pianists like Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell helped create and establish the sound of bebop. Bill Evans built upon the style of Bud Powell while adding a distinct classical influence to his playing while Oscar Peterson pushed rhythmic variations and was influenced by the style of Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson and Nat King Cole. Wynton Kelly, Red Garland, Herbie Hancock, and Keith Jarrett were also exceptional pianists who played with Miles Davis. Tommy Flanagan was featured by John Coltrane on his hit album \"Giant Steps\". McCoy Tyner is also an influential player who played with Coltrane.\n\n\n\n"}

Considered one of the top wingers of the 1940s, he led the NHL in goal scoring twice and in points once. Additionally, he was named a first-team All-Star three times, and a second-team All-Star once.\n\nHextall scored the overtime winning goal that clinched the 1940 Stanley Cup for the Rangers. He is the father of one of hockey's greatest families, as his sons Bryan Jr. and Dennis, and grandson Ron all had lengthy NHL careers. Bryan Sr. was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1969.\n\nBorn in Grenfell, Saskatchewan in 1913, Hextall grew up in Poplar Point, Manitoba. He played his first hockey there, winning the Manitoba juvenile championship in 1929–30. He played junior hockey with the Winnipeg Monarchs in 1931–32 before switching to the Portage Terriers with whom he won the Manitoba Junior Hockey League scoring title in 1932–33.\n\nHextall began his professional career in 1933–34 with the Vancouver Lions of the North West Hockey League (NWHL). He played three seasons in Vancouver, leading the NWHL in scoring with 27 goals in 1935–36. He moved onto the Philadelphia Ramblers of the International-American Hockey League the following year, again leading the league with 27 goals.\n\nThe New York Rangers brought Hextall up for three games in 1937, and he made the team full-time in 1937–38. A left-handed shooter, Hextall played his \"off wing\" – right wing – at a time before it was common practice. He scored at least 20 goals seven times in his career, mainly while playing on the Rangers' top line with Phil Watson and Lynn Patrick.\n\nHextall led the NHL in goal scoring and was named a first-team All-Star for the first time in 1939–40. He was one of the Rangers' top players during the 1940 Stanley Cup Final against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Hextall scored a hat trick against the Leafs and added an assist to lead the Rangers to a come from behind victory in game two of the series, and scored the overtime winning goal in the sixth game that clinched the third Stanley Cup championship in Rangers history. The Rangers would not win another for 54 years.\n\nA second All-Star selection followed in 1940–41 as Hextall again led the NHL in goal scoring and finished in a tie for second in overall points. He led the league in points in 1941–42; his total of 56 standing seven better than second place. Additionally, he was named to the first All-Star team for the third consecutive season.\n\nHextall scored career highs in goals, 27 and points, 59, in 1942–43 and was again named a post-season All-Star, this time on the second team. In addition to being a top scorer, Hextall was also durable. He appeared in 340 consecutive games for the Rangers between 1937 and 1944. His streak came to an end in 1944 when Canadian war authorities denied him a permit to cross into the United States. The Rangers' attempts to regain his services were unsuccessful, Unable to play in the NHL, Hextall regained his amateur status and played senior hockey briefly with the St. Catharines Saints in the Ontario Hockey Association's senior division.\n\nThe conclusion of World War II allowed Hextall to return to the Rangers in 1945–46, however his return was short-lived. He was hospitalized with a liver ailment, an illness that ruled him out of the season after just three games, and led to fears it would end his career. Hextall overcame doctors expectations, appearing in all 60 games for the Rangers in 1946–47. After a final season in the NHL in 1947–48, Hextall split the 1948–49 American Hockey League season between the Cleveland Barons and Washington Lions before announcing his retirement.\n\nHextall was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1969, and is an honoured member of the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. Additionally, the Manitoba hall named him to its all-century second All-Star team.\n\nHe was the first of three generations of Hextalls in the NHL. His sons Bryan Jr. and Dennis both had long careers, and his grandson Ron was a longtime goaltender in the league.\n\nHextall battled circulation problems in his lower legs following his retirement, an ailment that ultimately led to the amputation of both legs below the knee in 1978. Artificial legs allowed him to maintain his hobby of hunting. He died of a heart attack at his home of Poplar Point, Manitoba in 1984.\n"}

It included some of the territory of the Kingdom of Arelat.\n\nThe borders of Lower Burgundy were the Mediterranean Sea to the south, Septimania to the southwest, Aquitaine to the west, the Kingdom of Upper Burgundy to the north, and the Kingdom of Italy to the east.\n\nThe West Frankish King Louis the Stammerer died on 10 April 879 and was survived by two adult sons, Louis and Carloman. Boso, Count of Arles renounced allegiance to both brothers and in July claimed independence of the Kingdom of Provence. On 15 October 879, the bishops and nobles of the region around the rivers Rhône and Saône assembled in the Synod of Mantaille and elected Boso king as successor to Louis the Stammerer, the first non-Carolingian king in Western Europe in more than a century. This was the first \"free election\" of a king among the Franks, without regard to royal descent, though his mother was a Carolingian. The Kingdom of Provence comprised the ecclesiastical provinces of the archbishops of Arles, Aix, Vienne, Lyon (without Langres), and probably Besançon, as well as the dioceses of Tarentaise, Uzès, and Viviers.\n\nBoso was an incompetent ruler and by 882 King Carloman of West Francia reintegrated the kingdom into the West Frankish realm. When Carloman died on 12 December 884, the nobles of that kingdom (which included Lower Burgundy), invited Charles the Fat to assume the kingship. Arnulf of Carinthia deposed his uncle Charles in November 887. In 890 Boso's son Louis the Blind was crowned King of Lower Burgundy.\n\nLouis the Blind was invited into Italy by Adalbert II of Tuscany who wished to keep Berengar of Friuli from gaining control of the Italian peninsula. Louis defeated Berengar and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Benedict IV. Berengar defeated Louis the next year, forced him to flee Italy and promise to never return. In 905, Louis again invaded Italy but was defeated and blinded for breaking his oath. Louis lost his titles King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor to Berengar.\n\nBlinded, Louis had Hugh of Arles, the Count of Provence, be his regent. Hugh was elected King of Italy in 924 during a Civil War, and he spent the next two years ejecting his opponent, King Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy, from Italy. Louis died 928 and was succeeded by Hugh. After failing to expand his power by a marriage to Marozia (the effective ruler of Rome), Hugh spent the next five years of his reign fighting Magyar raids and Andalusian pirates. In 933, Hugh made peace with Rudolph of Upper Burgundy by giving him the Kingdom of Lower Burgundy, and the two Burgundies were combined into the Kingdom of Arles.\n\n"}

Two subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.\n\nAdults grow to an average of 2 to 2.5 m (6½-8 feet), although 3 m (10 feet) is not too unusual. The largest recorded specimen was almost 3.65 m (12 feet) long, making this the largest of all vipers and the longest venomous snake in the western hemisphere. \"Lachesis muta\" is the third longest venomous snake in the world. Weight in this species is estimated at an average of , somewhat less than the heaviest rattlesnakes or \"Bitis\" vipers, such as gaboon viper, and rhinoceros vipers.\n\nThe head is broad and distinct from the narrow neck. The snout is broadly rounded. There is no canthus. A pair of small internasals is present, separated by small scales. The supraoculars are narrow. Other parts of the crown are covered with very small scales. Laterally, the second supralabial forms the anterior border of the loreal pit, while the third is very large. The eye is separated from the supralabials by 4-5 rows of small scales.\n\nThe body is cylindrical, tapered and moderately stout. Midbody there are 31-37 nonoblique rows of dorsal scales which are heavily keeled with bulbous tubercles and feebly imbricate. There are 200-230 ventral scales. The tail is short with 32-50 mainly paired subcaudals, followed by 13-17 rows of small spines and a terminal spine. Like most New World pit vipers, Lachesis muta exhibits defensive tail vibration behavior in response to potential predatory threats\n\nThe color pattern consists of a yellowish, reddish or grey-brown ground color, overlaid with a series of dark brown or black dorsal blotches that form lateral inverted triangles of the same color. The lateral pattern may be precisely or indistinctly defined, normally pale at the center.\n\nKnown as the mapepire zanana or \"mapepire grande\" (pronounced \"ma-pa(y)-PEE za-Na-na\" or \"ma-pa(Y)-PEE GRAN-dey\") in Trinidad, \"surucucú\" in the Amazon Basin (\"surucucu\" in large part of Brazil), \"shushúpe\" in Peru, and \"pucarara\" in northern Bolivia. In Venezuela the species is known as \"cuaima\" or \"cuaima piña\". In Colombia it is known as \"verrugosa\" or \"verrugoso\" due to the warty look of its scales,\nand in Suriname as \"makasneki\" and \"makkaslang\". It is also known as the \"Atlantic bushmaster\".\n\nIt is called ĩtsãi in the Kwaza language of Rondônia, Brazil.\n\nIn the Shawi language of Peru, it is called na’shi.\n\n\"Lachesis\" is one of the three Fates in Greek mythology and was supposed to assign to man his term of life—something this species is certainly capable of doing. The species is similar in appearance to rattlesnakes and vibrates its tail vigorously when alarmed, but has no rattle and was therefore called \"mutus\" (later \"muta\"), which is Latin for dumb or mute. However, when in the undergrowth, the tail actually makes quite a loud rustling noise.\n\nFound in South America in the equatorial forests east of the Andes: Colombia, eastern Ecuador, Peru, northern Bolivia, eastern and southern Venezuela, the island of Trinidad in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Costa Rica Surinam, French Guiana and much of Brazil. The type locality is \"Surinami\" (Surinam). It occurs in primary and secondary forests; adjacent fields and cleared areas. In Trinidad it tends to prefer hilly and mountainous regions.\n\nSome reports suggest that this species produces a large amount of venom that is weak compared to some other vipers. Others, however, suggest that such conclusions are not accurate. These animals are badly affected by stress and rarely live long in captivity. This makes it difficult to obtain venom in useful quantities and good condition for study purposes. For example, Bolaños (1972) observed that venom yield from his specimens fell from 233 mg to 64 mg while they remained in his care. As the stress of being milked regularly has this effect on venom yield, it is reasoned that it may also affect venom toxicity. This may explain the disparity described by Hardy and Haad (1998) between the low laboratory toxicity of the venom and the high mortality rate of bite victims.\n\nBrown (1973) gives the following values for mice: 1.5 mg/kg IV, 1.6–6.2 mg/kg IP, 6.0 mg/kg SC. He also notes a venom yield of 200–411 mg.\n\nBushmasters prey primarily on rats and mice.\n\nTwo additional subspecies, \"L. m. melanocephala\" and \"L. m. stenophrys\", had earlier been recognized. However, both were elevated to species level by Zamudio and Green in 1997 (see \"L. melanocephala\" and \"L. stenophrys\").\n\n"}

As a professional, Holmes won the Stanley Cup four times, with four teams. He tied the record of his 1914 Stanley Cup winning Toronto Blueshirts teammate Jack Marshall, who also won Cups with four teams. No other player has duplicated this record.\n\nHolmes played as an amateur for three seasons with the Parkdale Canoe Club of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) from 1908 to 1911, before joining the professional Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1912–13. Holmes won the first of his four Stanley Cups in 1914. Although being under contract to the Blueshirts, Holmes joined the Seattle Metropolitans of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) for the 1915–16 season, winning his second Stanley Cup (1917) in his second season with the Metropolitans. For the 1917–18 season, Holmes ended up playing for the Torontos (the following year renamed as the Toronto Arenas) of the National Hockey League (NHL) through a series of loans by other teams. Holmes won his third Stanley Cup in his only full season with the Torontos. After playing two games in the 1918-19 season for the Toronto Arenas, Holmes would be recalled by the Metropolitans. Holmes played for the Metropolitans for the next six seasons, until the team folded. In the 1924–25 season, Holmes joined the Victoria Cougars of the West Coast Hockey League (WCHL/WHL). Holmes played for the Cougars for two seasons, winning the Stanley Cup for his fourth and last time. After the WCHL/WHL league folded, Holmes joined the Detroit Cougars of the NHL, playing with the Cougars for two seasons before retiring.\n\nHolmes was a stand-up style goaltender; later on in his career, Holmes wore a cap when in goal to protect his head from objects thrown by spectators, as it presented a tempting target to them. Holmes coached minor-league teams after his retirement, notably the Toronto Millionaires of the Canadian Professional Hockey League (CPHL) and the Cleveland Indians of the International Hockey League (IHL). Holmes died on June 27, 1941, near Fort Lauderdale, Florida and was inducted posthumously into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972.\n\nHarry \"Hap\" Holmes, alternatively nicknamed \"Happy\", started playing ice hockey as an amateur with the Parkdale Canoe Club in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) in the 1908–09 season. He played with Parkdale for three seasons, for 11 regular season games and two playoff games. In his first season with the Parkdale Canoe Club, Holmes lost all three games in which he appeared, giving up 22 goals over that stretch. The following season, Holmes appeared in four games, winning and losing two games apiece. Over the 1909–10 season, Holmes gave up 26 goals. In 1910–11, his last season with the Parkdale Canoe Club, he appeared in four regular season games once more, winning three and losing one, while giving up only 12 goals over those games. In the playoffs, Holmes played two games, losing one and tying the other, surrendering nine goals. In the 1911–12 season, Holmes appeared in only one exhibition game, as the Toronto Blueshirts were unable to play due to the slow completion of their artificial ice. Holmes played a game for the Toronto Tecumsehs, conceding three goals in a victory.\n\nHolmes began his professional career playing for the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1912–13. Holmes played with the Blueshirts for three seasons. In his first season with the Blueshirts, Holmes had a 6–7 (win-loss) record over 15 games with a shutout, and a 4.47 goals-against average. The Blueshirts ended up missing the playoffs. In the 1913–14 season, Holmes' second season with the Blueshirts, he won the Stanley Cup for the first time. It was the first time a Toronto-based team won the Stanley Cup. In the NHA playoffs, Holmes won one out of two games, and recorded a 1.00 goals-against average and one shutout; in the Stanley Cup final, Holmes won all three games and finished with a 2.59 goals-against average. The next season, the Blueshirts missed the playoffs, as Holmes had only eight victories over 20 games, ending up with a 4.18 goals-against average.\n\nIn the 1915–16 season, Holmes signed with the Seattle Metropolitans of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), although he was still under contract to the Blueshirts. In his first season with the Metropolitans, Holmes played 18 games. He finished with a 9–9 record, with no shutouts and a 3.67 goals-against average. That season, the Metropolitans missed the playoffs. In his sophomore season, Holmes posted a 16–8 record over 24 games, with two shutouts and a 3.28 goals-against average. In the Stanley Cup finals, Holmes posted a 3–1 record with a 2.75 goals-against average, en route to the Metropolitans' only Stanley Cup win. The Metropolitans became the first American-based team to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nIn November 1917, Holmes signed as a free agent with the Montreal Wanderers. The Wanderers, in turn, loaned Holmes back to Seattle on December 12, 1917. On January 4, 1918, the Metropolitans returned Holmes under loan to the Torontos, now in the newly formed NHL. In his only full season with the Torontos/Arenas, Holmes appeared in 16 regular season games, posting a 9–7 record, with a 4.73 goals-against average and no shutouts. In the NHL playoffs, Holmes played two games, winning and losing one apiece. In the Stanley Cup finals, Holmes had a 3–2 record over five games, with a 4.00 goals-against average, en route to Holmes' third Stanley Cup win. He is the only member of both the Blueshirts' 1914 Stanley Cup win and the Torontos' 1917 Stanley Cup win. After playing only two games with the Toronto Arenas the following season, surrendering nine goals in two losses, Holmes was recalled by the Metropolitans on December 27, 1918.\n\nIn the 1918–19 season Holmes appeared in 20 regular season games for the Metropolitans, winning 11 and losing nine, with no shutouts and a 2.25 goals-against average. In the PCHA playoffs, Holmes played two games, winning and losing one apiece, and surrendering five goals in total. The Metropolitans made the Stanley Cup finals once more. Playing against the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL), the series was abandoned tied at two wins apiece, because of the Spanish Influenza pandemic. Montreal could not continue the series because one of their players, Joe Hall, was severely ill with influenza; however, the Metropolitans did not wish to accept the Cup by default. Hall eventually died on April 5, 1919, five days after the end of the series, in a Seattle hospital. The only draw of the series was a scoreless affair; after playing 20 minutes of overtime, referee Mickey Ion called the game off.\n\nIn the 1919–20 season, Holmes appeared in 22 games, winning 12 games, and losing 10. He finished the season with four shutouts and a 2.46 goals-against average. In the PCHA playoffs, Holmes played two games, surrendering three goals, and ending up with a loss and a win. The Metropolitans made the Stanley Cup finals for the second straight season, playing against the Ottawa Senators of the NHL. The Metropolitans lost, and Holmes posted a 2–3 record with a 3.00 goals-against average.\n\nHolmes played the next four seasons with the Metropolitans, but failed to make the Stanley Cup final. Over that stretch, Holmes and the Metropolitans won about half the games each season. The Metropolitans missed the playoffs in only the 1922–23 season. In the 1920–21 season, Holmes appeared in 24 games. He posted a 12–11–1 (win-loss-tie) record, with a 2.63 goals-against average and no shutouts. In the playoffs, he lost both games he appeared in, and let in 13 goals. The following season, he posted an identical win-loss-tie record in both the regular season. The only difference was a 2.60 goals-against average in the regular season, with four shutouts, and the reduction of his playoffs goals-against by 11 goals. In the 1922–23 season, Holmes appeared in 30 games, posting a 15–15 record, with two shutouts and a 3.45 goals-against average; however, the Metropolitans missed the playoffs that season. In the 1923–24, Holmes' last with the Metropolitans, he appeared in 30 regular-season games, posting a 14–16 record, with two shutouts and a 3.26 goals-against average. Despite an extra loss, the Metropolitans made the playoffs that season. Holmes played two games, losing one and tying one, ending up with a 1.79 goals-against average.\n\nIn 1924–25, after the Metropolitans folded and the rest of the PCHA merged with the WCHL, Holmes joined the Victoria Cougars. In his first season with the Cougars, Holmes posted a 16–12 regular season record, with three shutouts and a 2.25 goals-against average. In the WCHL playoffs, Holmes was undefeated in four games. He had two wins and ties each, with one shutout and a 1.75 goals-against average. In the Stanley Cup final, Holmes posted a 3–1 record with a 2.00 goals-against average against the Montreal Canadiens. It was the last time a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup. It was Holmes' fourth and last Stanley Cup victory.\n\nThe following season, Holmes had a 15–11–4 regular season record, with four shutouts and a 1.68 goals-against average. In the WHL playoffs, Holmes nearly duplicated his results from the previous season, posting a 2–0–2 record, with one shutout and a 1.45 goals-against average. In the 1926 Stanley Cup final, the Cougars lost the series 3–1 against the Montreal Maroons. That marked the last time a non-NHL team appeared in the Stanley Cup finals, as the WHL folded after the 1926 Stanley Cup final, and its players were absorbed by the NHL. It was Holmes' seventh and final Stanley Cup final appearance.\n\nA new NHL franchise in Detroit bought the rights to the Victoria Cougars players, and named the team the Cougars. Holmes played his last two professional seasons with the Detroit Cougars. Holmes, playing for Detroit, posted 17 shutouts in 85 appearances. Detroit failed to make the playoffs in both of Holmes' seasons with them, as Holmes only won 30 of his 85 appearances. In Holmes' first season with Detroit, he posted an 11–26–4 record, over 41 games played. Holmes had six shutouts and overall, his goals-against average that season was 2.23. In the 1927–28 season, Holmes' final one as a professional player, he appeared in all 44 of Detroit's games. He posted at 19–19–6 record, with 11 shutouts and a 1.73 goals-against average.\n\nAs a player, Holmes wore a baseball cap in net to protect his head from spectators spitting tobacco or throwing other objects at it. Holmes was bald, and as described by the \"Windsor Star\", \"his shining bald dome presented a tempting target\". Holmes played a stand-up style, and relied on proper positioning to stop the puck. Holmes' play was consistent, and he was relaxed and nonchalant in the nets, leading some to describe his play as almost lazy.\n\nAfter his playing career, Holmes coached minor-league teams. He coached the Toronto Millionaires of the Canadian Professional Hockey League (CPHL) to a 19–6–7 record in the 1928–29 season, and the Cleveland Indians of the International Hockey League (IHL) to a 24–18–6 record in the 1930–31 season. The American Hockey League (AHL) named their award for the top goaltender, the Hap Holmes Memorial Award, after him. Holmes died on June 27, 1941. He was inducted posthumously into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972.\n"}

{"id": "1992455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992455", "title": "Stephen Mack Jr.", "text": "Stephen Mack Jr.\n\nStephen Mack Jr. (2 February 1798 – 10 April 1850) adventurer and pioneer, American Fur Company employee, founder of Rockton, Illinois.\n\nBorn in Tunbridge, Vermont, he was the son of Stephen and Temperance (Bond) Mack. Stephen, Jr. was a first cousin to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and when the Latter-day Saints moved to Utah, Stephen's mother accompanied them. Stephen Mack, Sr. was engaged in the mercantile business at Tunbridge until 1807 when he went to Detroit, leaving his wife and family behind. \n\nThe senior Mack valued education, and knowing that there was little opportunity in such a remote frontier village, he had his family remain in Vermont. The younger Mack would later pursue for himself a level of education uncommon for his time, and when he had children of his own, he was very active in procuring for them the best educational opportunities. Stephen Mack, Sr. was the first English-speaking merchant in Detroit. He entered into a partnership which was known as Mack & Conant which remained in business until 1821 when it was bought out by its chief competitor The American Fur Company. In 1812 he became a trustee of the village of Detroit and later he was the founder of the city of Pontiac\nand a director of the Bank of Michigan. \n\nStephen, Jr. attended Moors Charity School, a preparatory school at Hanover, New Hampshire from 30 August 1813 to 24 August 1816, He then attended a college in Boston but was forced to drop out after a minor illness he failed to properly attend to which became a major one (he did not attend Dartmouth as has often been claimed). It is believed that he joined his father and other family members in Detroit in 1819.\n\nAt that point it is said that he joined a government expedition around the Great Lakes which purpose has not been determined. Edson I. Carr's history of Rockton, published in 1898, relates a romance that Mack learned from traders at Green Bay about Illinois and possible opportunities there, so Mack traveled to the Rock River to the present site of Janesville and then traveled south into Illinois. At a Winnebago village at the present site of South Beloit, he learned of another village farther south located at the present site of Hononegah Forest Preserve, however legend says that Mack took the wrong path and ended up some forty miles to the southwest at a Winnebago village at the present site of Grand Detour in Ogle County. There he met a trader named Lasallier (perhaps his full name was Pierre St. Clair dit Lasallier), an old trading veteran who had operated trading posts on the Illinois and Rock Rivers since 1793. It is much more probable that the truth was that Mack had already known that Lasallier was there and had intended to work for him as a clerk, a usual practice for trading companies. \n\nMack was a clerk at his arrival in 1820, and on 20 October 1823 he received his first licence as a trader followed by licences on 6 September 1824 and 5 October 1826. Evidence suggests that Mack spent his winters at Grand Detour and then lived in Chicago during the summer. It is known that he voted occasionally and served as a clerk in elections there from 1828 to 1830. On 29 September 1830 he bought two lots in Chicago in the block bound by Randolph, Market, Washington and Water Streets. \n\nWhile residing at Grand Detour, Stephen Mack met his wife Hononegah. We do not know how or when they met. There is only a shadowy legend that Mack was sick with fever and that Hononegah nursed him back to health. During his stay at Grand Detour, Mack's relations with the villagers were not good. It is said that he became an advisor to the village chief and that the residents were jealous of Mack's supposed influence over him. They also were resentful of Mack, because he had not married one of their women. According to Carr's history previously sited, Mack refused to sell liquor and firearms to them. There are several stories about Mack escaping death with Hononegah's help. One time she warned him that the villagers were coming to kill him, and it took Mack an entire day to finally outrun them. On another occasion Hononegah hid Mack in a barrel. The third story preserved by Edson Carr relates that Mack was returning to the village from Chicago when Hononegah met Mack in the woods to warn him not to return to the village. It is believed that Mack did not marry Hononegah for love, but to express his gratitude to her for saving his life on so many occasions. In February 1829 Mack purchased Lasallier's cabin, and it is probable that at this time Mack had formalized his relationship with Hononegah. It is believed that they had a child that died at birth sometime in 1829. Their eldest surviving child Rosa was born 14 November 1830. Sometime in 1829 Stepehn Mack, Jr. and Hononegah Mack fled Grand Detour for good.\n\nThey went up the river into present day Winnebago County and built a cabin in a Winnebago village at the present site of Hononegah Forest Preserve. Mack's sojourn there was peaceful until the outbreak of the Black Hawk War when a party of Black Hawk's braves raided his cabin searching for his supply of gunpowder (which Mack succeeded to hide). On 9 May 1832, Mack was run out of his cabin, and he and Hononegah fled to Chicago. Edson Carr relates a romance in which Mack met Black Hawk, and after the villagers advised Mack that they could not protect him, Mack took refuge on Webber's Island, and Hononegah provided him with food and fresh water daily until the threat was passed. Carr seems not to have believed the story, and modern research has also cast doubt on it. \n\nOn 24 May 1832 Mack enlisted in Captain John S.C. Hogan's company of militia with the rank of 1st Sergeant. Mack's company was too small to be an effectual military organization, and the only noteworthy event was when the company discovered the aftermath of the Indian Creek Massacre (which occurred 20 May) at the Davis home some twelve miles north of Ottawa where fifteen whites were slain. By about the second week of June, army regulars from Michigan began arriving in Illinois to continue the war, and by mid-June Mack's company of militia was dissolved. \n\nBy a treaty signed in Chicago by the Pottawatomie's on 28 September 1833, Mack received $600.00 on behalf of his three daughters (supporting the belief that Hononegah was part Pottawatomie). After the war Mack returned to his cabin to resume his trading operations.\n\nOn 25 July 1835 William Talcott and his son Thomas visited Mack, and at this time Mack announced his intentions to found a new community on the south bluff overlooking the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica Rivers which he would name Pecatonic. Mack believed that the Rock River was navigable upstream for an additional 150 miles while the Pecatonica was navigable for 100 miles, and his site was ideal as a center for trade and commerce. The Talcott's returned to the East to get their families, and when they returned the following autumn, Mack had moved to the site of his new community, now located in the present day Macktown Forest Preserve. \n\nThe land that Mack was residing on was originally claimed by Joseph Thiebeau who bought the rights for a section of land for his daughter under the terms of a treaty signed at Prairie du Chien on 1 August 1829. Subsequently the daughter died young making Joseph the legal heir and owner of the section, and on 17 January 1838 Thiebeau sold the land to Jean Baptiste Beaubien, a well-known trader active in Chicago for many years. By June 1838 Beaubien was a partner with Stephen Mack, and, along with John P. Bradstreet, began selling lots in the new community. \n\nOn 1 November 1837 a treaty with the Winnebago's was signed in Washington. Mack presented a claim for $6,400.00 in merchandise. It was prorated by the commission and Mack received $2,329.50. He also received an additional $5,000.00 on behalf of his five children (supporting the belief that Hononegah was part Winnebago). \n\nWith this money Mack built himself a fine two-story frame house with a cellar, which later became the residence for the forest preserve caretaker and is now a museum. He also used the money to make other improvements. Sometime during 1842/43 Mack built the first bridge across the Rock River in Illinois, formerly located where the public boat landing is presently. The bridge replaced a ferry he had started in 1837. Mack had offered Talcott a partnership in his settlement, but there was disagreement on the terms and words were exchanged. There was a falling out between the two men, and the breach was never healed.\n\nTalcott was interested in energy. He settled on the north side of the river within the present village of Rockton. He bought most of the area and divided it into lots. On 2 June 1838 he sold his first lot. Earlier, the Talcott's began digging a millrace, and in the Fall of 1839, their gristmill was fully operational. At the time it was the only operation of its kind, and farmers traveled many miles to have their crops processed. A hotel was built for their lodging, and the settlement to the north of the river quickly expanded supplanting Mack's Pecatonic settlement.\n\nIn 1845 Mack tried to interest the Beloit College directors in building a seminary in his settlement. He even was willing to donate 20 acres (81,000 m²) of his own land for the site. Probably Mack's motive was to provide a facility for the education of his own daughters. \n\nBut the directors decided to put the seminary in Rockford, and this became the basis for Rockford College. Despite this setback, Mack saw to it that a classroom was set up in the second story of a house. He insisted that the settlement's girls be allowed to attend as well as the boys, and the classroom was even open to the Winnebago children. In spite of the care he took to see that his own children were educated, it is recorded by Edson Carr that one of his daughters was too wild and often walked out on classes, and it is said that Mack eventually gave up on educating her. \n\nDespite his bad relations with the Talcotts, Mack seemed to realize that the area's future was with Talcott's settlement. In 1846 by an act of the legislature, the town was officially named Rockton, a name suggested by one of the Talcott's, and in 1849 Mack was made a Justice of the Peace and the first township treasurer of the school funds. On 14 September 1840 Mack was married to Hononegah by a Justice of the Peace. Since he was not legally married to her, he was concerned that his children might not inherit his estate, so he secured a legal marriage to that ends. \n\nAt an unknown date, Mack had formed a business partnership with his cousin Merrill Elmaren Mack. He was incompetent, and when he died 25 March 1844, he left Stephen Mack with substantial debt and lots of useless merchandise. Mack abandoned trading and merchandise altogether and bought a dairy farm west of Rockton which was managed by the Stocker family (his second daughter Mary married Charles Stocker). As time passed and interest in his settlement dwindled, Mack bought up all the remaining available lots, and at the time of his death, all of the land which comprises the present Macktown Forest Preserve was owned by him. \n\nHononegah died of fever 8 September 1847 leaving Mack with the responsibility of raising their eight surviving children. On 4 February 1848 Mack married Isabella Daniels of Harrison in order to provide a caregiver for his children.\n\nIn 1850 Winnebago County was formally divided into townships. In an election held 2 April 1850 Mack ran for the position of the first Township Supervisor of Rockton and was narrowly defeated by Sylvester Talcott. Six days later on the following 10 April Mack died suddenly of unknown causes (rumors circulated for years that he was poisoned). Land for the Rockton Cemetery was donated to the village by one of the Talcott's, and Mack refused to have his own family members buried there. Mack, Hononegah and one of their sons were buried in a cemetery which is near the present golf course club house and is marked by a boulder with a memorial plaque. \n\nIn 1880 the Mack estate was owned by Sylvester Smith. The cemetery was in such poor condition that Smith announced that he intended to plow the site under, and if anyone had family buried there, they had better move them soon. The Macks were moved to Phillips Cemetery west of Rockton. \n\nIn May 1964 the executive committee for the forest preserve decided that Rockton's founding father should be buried next to the Mack home and announced that they were moving their remains back to Macktown.

Given the title \"The White Art Tatum\" by jazz legend Art Tatum, Costa is best known for his work as musical director of the children's television program \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\".\n\nCosta learned to play accordion at age seven and was reading music three years later. Frank Oliver, Costa's high school music teacher, urged him to learn the piano after discovering that Costa had perfect pitch. Costa graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with degrees in music and in education. In case he failed as a musician, Costa prepared himself to teach. On the day of his graduation, he began work as the house pianist for a radio station in Pittsburgh. Eventually he performed the same role for KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh. He provided piano and organ music for many programs, eventually teaming with Fred Rogers to arrange and perform the music heard on \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.\" \n\nCosta's first recording was \"The Amazing Johnny Costa\", a Savoy LP released in 1955 and reissued on CD as \"Neighborhood\" in 1989. Although his increasingly lucrative career was beginning to bring him international attention, the amount of time away from his family and friends led him to live and perform only in western Pennsylvania. He stopped traveling and gave up his job as musical director of \"The Mike Douglas Show\". He returned to Pittsburgh and remained there for the rest of his life.\n\nCosta appeared along with guitarist Joe Negri on the 1954 Ken Griffin TV series \"67 Melody Lane\". Johnny and Joe played two numbers, \"After You've Gone\" and \"Little Brown Jug\", the latter with Ken Griffin at the organ.\n\nCosta served as musical director, arranger, and keyboardist for the children's television series \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" from the program's debut in 1968 until his death in 1996. The program's creator and host, Fred Rogers, regarded Costa as one of the most gifted musicians he had ever met. Rogers' choice was surprising because Costa's style was regarded as too complicated and sophisticated for a children's program. Costa accepted the job without hesitation because it wouldn't require him to travel away from Pittsburgh, and because Rogers offered him the same amount he needed to pay his son's college tuition ($5000). Although Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was a children's program, Costa insisted on not playing \"baby\" music. He believed children understood good music and that he could experiment with his own musical styles and techniques, even for a children's program. Each day, Costa and his trio (Carl McVicker Jr. on bass, Bobby Rawsthorne on percussion) played live in the studio for the filming. In addition to the show's recognizable main theme, they played the trolley whistle, Mr. McFeely's frenetic Speedy Delivery piano plonks, the vibraphone flute-toots (on a synthesizer) as Fred fed his fish, dreamy celesta lines, incidental music, and Rogers' entrance and exit tunes.\n\nCosta died of aplastic anemia in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the age of 74.\n\nAfter his death, Michael Moricz took over as musical director on \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood until\" the show ended in 2001. Much of Costa's music continued to be used, including the celeste music at the beginning of each episode. At Moricz's request, the show's closing credits continued to list Costa alongside Moricz as its musical directors.\n\n"}

He played for the Kenora Thistles, Montreal Hockey Club, and Montreal Wanderers. Hooper was a Stanley Cup winner with the Thistles in 1907 and the Wanderers in 1908. Noted for his skating speed, checking and stick-handling ability, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\nHooper was born in the village of Rat Portage, later renamed Kenora, in north-western Ontario, Canada. He first played organized hockey for a local high school. The high school team was very talented, good enough to defeat Rat Portage's senior ice hockey team. In 1896, at the age of thirteen, Hooper joined the Rat Portage senior hockey team where he would play until 1908. During his years with the club, the Thistles won three league titles and challenged for the Stanley Cup three times, in 1903 and 1905 against Ottawa, and 1907 against the Montreal Wanderers. The team won the Cup in January 1907, in part due to Hooper's three goals in the second game of the two-game total-goals series. The team went on to defend the Stanley Cup as league champions but lost the title in March 1907 to the same Wanderers. Hooper missed the March series rematch due to a fractured collarbone.\n\nThe Thistles folded after one game in January 1908 and Hooper joined the Montreal Wanderers. He only played two season games with the Wanderers and two Stanley Cup challenge games before he got his release from the team. He had been moved to the cover-point defence position by the Wanderers from his career forward position and lost the starting job to Walter Smaill. He signed with the Montreal Hockey Club for the rest of the season, where he played rover. Hooper's play in the 1907–08 season was considered by hockey writers to not be up to the standard of his previous years due to his fitness. He retired after the season.\n\nAfter hockey, Hooper moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. He died in 1960 and is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\n"}

Osborne is the former drummer and lead singer of the American R&B/Soul group L.T.D.; with whom he began his musical career in 1970.\n\nOsborne was born in Providence, Rhode Island. Born the youngest of twelve children which consisted of five brothers and six sisters, Osborne's family was musically inclined. Some of Osborne's siblings went on to have music careers, his brother Billy Osborne was his band-mate in L.T.D. Osborne's father, Clarence \"Legs\" Osborne, was a popular trumpeter who played with Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, and Duke Ellington. Osborne's father died in 1961 when Osborne was thirteen.\n\nOsborne began his music career in 1970 becoming a member of the American soul band \"Love Men Ltd.\", who would later become known as L.T.D. The band recorded hit singles such as \"(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again\"(1977), \"Concentrate on You,\" \"Love Ballad\"(1976), and \"Holding On (When Love Is Gone)\"(1978). At first, Osborne served as only a drummer, sharing lead vocal duties with his brother Billy Osborne; but by 1976 he became the group's primary lead vocalist. Osborne and his brother both left the band in late 1980 to start solo careers. Osborne's solo success includes five gold and platinum albums.\n\nIn 1982, Osborne sang the opening song \"I Just Want to Be Your Friend\" for the comedy film \"The Toy\". Osborne later released his self-titled debut album in 1982, which featured two hit singles, \"On the Wings of Love\" and \"I Really Don't Need No Light\" (1982), peaking at #29 & #39 on the pop chart respectively. This was followed up the next year by \"Stay with Me Tonight\", his first gold album (later reaching platinum album status), which spawned two more hits, \"Don't You Get So Mad\" (#25) and the title track (#30). \"Stay with Me Tonight\" (May 1984, #18) and \"On the Wings of Love\" (August 1984, #11) reached the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn 1985, Osborne wrote the lyrics to the Whitney Houston hit \"All at Once\" (music by Michael Masser). He appeared on USA for Africa's fundraising single, \"We Are the World\" in 1985. Osborne sang the unreleased single \"Everything Good Takes Time\" which was part of a video tribute to Julius Erving (Dr. J) in 1987. He would later appear on \"Celebrity Duets\" in 2006, performing \"On the Wings of Love\" with Alfonso Ribeiro. Osborne lent his vocals to the theme song of the soap opera, \"Loving\", from 1992 to 1995 as well as the first season theme song for the Kirstie Alley comedy \"Veronica's Closet\".\n\nOsborne had two more gold albums, \"Don't Stop\" and \"Emotional\", the latter of which had his highest charting solo pop hit, \"You Should Be Mine\", which peaked at #13 in 1986. The following year, Osborne had the highest-charting hit of his career duetting with Dionne Warwick on \"Love Power\", which reached #12 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and also topped the Adult Contemporary singles chart. This was a turning point in his pop success, as his albums and singles began charting lower and lower on the pop charts. Osborne's 1988 single \"She's on the Left\" would be his final Hot 100 entry, as well as his only #1 R&B hit.\n\nIn the new millennium, he returned with a series of albums that, while far from the success he enjoyed in the 1980s, returned him to Adult R&B radio, scoring modest chart singles such as \"Rest of Our Lives\" (#75, 2003) and his cover of Barbara Mason's classic \"Yes, I'm Ready\" (#64, 2005). In 2008, Osborne sang the national anthem before Game 4 of the NBA Finals at Staples Center in Los Angeles, a feat which he repeated in 2009, before Game 1 of the 2009 NBA Finals, and also again in 2010 before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, all at Staples Center in Los Angeles. He also performed the national anthem prior to Game 3 of the 1988 World Series, a feat he repeated two years later at Game 3 of the 1990 World Series, both at the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland, California. He also regularly sang the national anthem before Hartford Whalers games. On March 1, 2010, Osborne appeared on \"\" season finale, \"After the Final Rose\", singing his hit \"On the Wings of Love\" while Bachelor Jake Pavelka took to the dance floor with his newly announced fiancé, Vienna Girardi.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Jeffrey Osborne among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\nOsborne has been married to Sheri Osborne since 1983 and together they have three daughters; Tiffany Nicole, Dawn and Jeanine Osborne and one son; Jeffrey Jr.\n\n\n\nOsborne received the 2014 New England Pell Award for Artistic Excellence from Providence (Rhode Island)'s Trinity Repertory Company in honor of his artistic achievements and philanthropic work in Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n"}

Hutton also played lacrosse as a goaltender for the Ottawa Capitals, and Canadian football as a fullback for the Ottawa Rough Riders. Playing at the highest level of competition in each sport, Hutton won championships with all three teams.\n\nAfter his career as a player, Hutton was an ice hockey coach in Ottawa for several years. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\nHutton began his ice hockey career with the Ottawa Hockey Club of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL) in the 1899 season with two appearances. The 1900 season was Hutton's first full season with Ottawa. Hutton finished the season with a 2.70 goals-against average, in a time when double-digit scores were very common. In the 1901 season, Hutton played all eight games, and continued to have a low goals-against average, of 2.50. In the 1902 season, Hutton recorded two shutouts, and finished with a 1.70 goals-against average.\n\nIn the 1903 season, his average increased to 3.80; however, in the CAHL playoffs, Hutton posted a 1–0–1 record, with one shutout and a 0.50 goals-average, while in the Stanley Cup finals, Hutton posted a 2–0 record, with a 2.00 goals-against average as Ottawa won the Stanley Cup. After the Stanley Cup win, the Ottawa Hockey Club was renamed the Silver Seven, after the silver coins given to the players after their Stanley Cup victory. In the 1904 season, Hutton won all of Ottawa's four games, but the team withdrew from the CAHL mid-season before completing its eight-game schedule. Hutton appeared in Stanley Cup challenges only, posting a 6–1–1 record, with one shutout and a 2.90 goals-against average. At the end of the CAHL season, the Stanley Cup trustees ruled that Ottawa would retain the Cup. After the conclusion of the 1904 season, Hutton temporarily retired from ice hockey. His replacement in the Silver Seven's nets was Dave Finnie. Hutton returned for one more season with Ottawa Senators of the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL) in 1909; he appeared in five games.\n\nDuring his ice hockey career, Hutton won the first Minto Cup, then awarded to Canada's top senior men's lacrosse team, in 1901 with the Ottawa Capitals. In the fall of 1902, Hutton won the Canadian football championship with Ottawa Rough Riders. After his retirement from ice hockey, Hutton won another Minto Cup with the Capitals in 1904. The team toured England after the win, and 23 out of 24 games.\n\n"}

It is known as Ning-thi to the Meitei people.\nIts official name is also spelled Chindwinn.\n\nThe Chindwin originates in the broad Hukawng Valley of Kachin State of Burma, roughly\n, where the Tanai, the Tabye, the Tawan, and the Taron (also known as Turong or Towang) rivers meet.\n\nThe headwaters of the Tanai are at about\n\nThe Tanai exits the Hukawng valley through the Taron or Turong valley and through a sharp defile in the river. It then takes on the name of Chindwin, and maintains a general southerly course. It passes the town of Singkaling Hkamti on the left bank, then the town of Homalin, also on the left bank.\n\nThe river's course is generally southwesterly until the town of Mingin. It then takes a more southeasterly course entering into broad central plain, passing the city of Monywa on the left bank. Its course at this point forms the boundary between the Sagaing District of Sagaing Region and the Pakokku District of Magway Region.\n\nIt enters the Ayeyarwady River (Irrawaddy) at about . The extreme outlets into the Ayeyarwady are about 22 miles apart, the interval forming a succession of long, low, partially populated islands. The lowest mouth of the Chindwin is, according to tradition, an artificial channel, cut by one of the kings of Bagan (Pagan). It was choked up for centuries until 1824 when it was opened out by an exceptional flood. Satellite pictures show this lowest channel to be the widest one today.\n\n\n\nMuch of Chindwin's course lies within mountain ranges and forests. Due to the difficulty of access, much of it remains unspoilt. The government of Burma recently created a very large (2,500 square mile) sanctuary for the endangered tiger within the Hukawng Valley.\n\nThe mountain ranges to the west of the Chindwin are formidable, yet not totally impregnable to armies. The Kabaw valley saw many an invasion by the kingdom of Manipur to the west, most notably during the reign of King Garibaniwaj (1709–1748) when his army crossed over the Chindwin and the Mu, took Myedu, and reached as far as Sagaing opposite the capital Ava. The tables were turned in 1758 after King Alaungpaya ascended the Burmese throne. The Burmese army invaded and occupied Manipur and Assam marching across the western mountain ranges, and even encroached upon British India.\n\nDuring World War II, when the Japanese had cut off sea access, the British army and other allied forces under General Joseph Stilwell retreated on foot to India across the same mountains, with disastrous results, mainly due to disease and hunger. The Ledo Road was built across the Hukawng valley to supply China. The Chindwin was a major barrier both for the Japanese trying to invade India and for the Allied forces to reoccupy Burma.\n\nThe chindwin river has a great impact on the culture of western Burma. According to Andrew Hsiu which taken from a journal titled\n\"Morphological Evidence for a Central Branch of Trans-Himalayan (Sino-Tibetan).\" by Scott DeLancey which was published on 2015, Central Sino-Tibetan (which includes Meithei) languages originated from valley areas of this river.\n\nThe Chindwin is served by regular river-going vessels up to the town of Homalin. Teak forests within its drainage area have been a valuable resource since ancient times. The Hukawng Valley is known for its abundance of Burmese amber. Along the river, there are deposits of jade, but Hpakant in the headwaters of the Uyu river is the only place in the world where the finest jade - known as jadeite or imperial jade - is found, along with an abundance of fish.\n\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles, Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Florida Marlins, and Cleveland Indians.\n\nBorowski grew up in Bayonne, attended Marist High School and was an All-America selection in both football and baseball and a two-time All-State selection in both sports. He attended Rutgers University in New Jersey.\n\nBorowski was a 32nd round draft pick of the Chicago White Sox in 1989. In 2000, Borowski pitched in the Mexican League for the Monterrey Sultanes and in the Northern League.\n\nBefore his second year with the Chicago Cubs in 2002, Borowski had never appeared in more than 25 games, but when given a chance to appear frequently he did very well. Between his stints with the Yankees and Cubs, he worked as a fireman. In 2002, he went 4-4 with a 2.73 ERA in 73 games of relief. The next year, he was converted to the closer role for the Cubs and was exceptional, going 2-2 with a 2.63 ERA and recording 33 saves in 37 opportunities, helping the Cubs win their division and reach the NLCS before being eliminated by the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins. In 2004, Borowski suffered from a partial tear in his right rotator cuff which limited him to just 22 games, in which he struggled, going 2-4 with an 8.02 ERA and recording 9 saves in 11 opportunities. In 2005, Borowski broke his hand on a come-backer that went directly at him. He returned to the Cubs on May 20. He did not have his old closer job back, though, as Ryan Dempster had emerged as the club's new closer. On June 29, 2005, Borowski was released by the Cubs.\n\nBorowski was later in 2005 acquired by the Devil Rays, who use him as a set-up man to closer Danys Báez. While with the Devil Rays, Borowski got very hot, pitching a franchise record 21 scoreless innings, and is seen by many as the catalyst for the Devil Rays 2nd half turnaround, as his inspired performance helped stabilize the Rays' otherwise shaky bullpen. However, in his last 14 appearances he gave up 15 runs, and was designated for assignment by the Devil Rays in early December, and then released.\n\nDuring the 2006 season, Borowski pitched for the Florida Marlins and converted 36 out of 43 save opportunities. On December 6, 2006, Borowski signed a $4.25 million, one-year contract to pitch for the Cleveland Indians that included a club option for 2008. The signing of Borowski filled the vacant closer role for Cleveland.\n\nDuring the 2007 season, Borowski got off to a slow start as closer for the Indians, posting an earned run average of 13.50 in his first seven outings. His struggles were capped off after surrendering six runs to the New York Yankees on April 19, 2007, in the ninth inning after coming into the game with a 4-run lead. Borowski was not charged with a blown save in this outing, since a 3-run lead or smaller is required for a pitcher to earn the save. He led the American League with 45 saves, but had a pitiful 5.07 ERA, the highest ever for a closer with 40 or more saves.\n\nOn November 6, 2007, the Indians exercised his $4 million club option, opting to bring him back in 2008. Had the team declined Borowski's option, he would have been paid a $250,000 buyout.\n\nIn 2008, Borowski got off to a bad start to the season. Putting up an 18.00 ERA with two blown saves through 5 appearances, he averaged a walk, 2 hits, and 2 runs per appearance. Following another dreadful appearance in which he gave up 3 runs in 2/3 inning on April 14 the Indians put him on the 15-day DL with a strained triceps.\n\nBorowski was designated for assignment by the Indians on July 4, and released on July 10, 2008.\n\nOn February 24, 2009, Borowski announced his retirement.\n\nBorowski currently resides in Scottsdale, Arizona, with his wife Tatum and two sons Blaze and Ty. \n\nHe accepted an award in 2004 from the Polish American Polish Association as a distinguished Polish-American.\n\n\n, or Mexican League, or Retrosheet, or The Baseball Gauge, or Venezuela Winter League\n"}

It aims to offer realistic air-combat training for military pilots and other flight crew members from the United States and allied countries.\n\nEach year, four to six Red Flag exercises are held at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, while up to four more, dubbed Red Flag – Alaska, are held at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska.\n\nFirst held in 1975, Red Flag exercises bring together aircrews from the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Army (USA) and numerous NATO and allied nations' air forces.\n\nRed Flag exercises are conducted under the aegis of the United States Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC) at Nellis. They are run by the 414th Combat Training Squadron (414 CTS) of the 57th Wing (57 WG). They use \"enemy\" hardware and live ammunition for bombing exercises within the adjacent Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR).\n\nThe 414 CTS mission is to maximize the combat readiness and survivability of participants by providing a realistic training environment and a pre-flight and post-flight training forum that encourages a free exchange of ideas. To accomplish this, combat units from the United States and its allied countries engage in realistic combat training scenarios carefully conducted within the Nellis Range Complex. The Nellis Range complex is located northwest of Las Vegas and covers an area of by , about half the area of Switzerland. This space allows the exercises to be on an enormous scale.\nIn a typical Red Flag exercise, Blue Forces (friendly) engage Red Forces (hostile) in realistic combat situations.\n\nBlue Forces are made up of units from the Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air National Guard (ANG), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), aviation units of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army, the Royal Air Force, Royal Canadian Air Force, and Royal Australian Air Force, as well as other allied air forces and fleet air arms. They are led by a Blue Forces commander, who coordinates the units in an \"employment plan\" scheme of operation.\n\nRed Forces (adversary forces) are composed of the 57th Wing's 57th Adversary Tactics Group (57 ATG), flying F-16s from the 64th Aggressor Squadron (64 AGRS) and F-15s from the 65th Aggressor Squadron (65 AGRS) to provide realistic air threats through the emulation of opposition tactics. The Red Forces are also augmented by other U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps units flying in concert with the 507th Air Defense Aggressor Squadron's (507 ADAS) electronic ground defenses and communications, and radar jamming equipment. The 527th Space Aggressor Squadron (527 SAS), an Active Duty unit, and the 26th Space Aggressor Squadron (26 SAS), an Air Force Reserve Command unit, also provide GPS jamming. Additionally, the Red Force command and control organization simulates a realistic enemy integrated air defense system (IADS).\nA key element of Red Flag operations is the Red Flag Measurement and Debriefing System (RFMDS). RFMDS is a computer hardware and software network that provides real-time monitoring, post-mission reconstruction of maneuvers and tactics, participant pairings, and integration of range targets and simulated threats. Blue Force commanders objectively assess mission effectiveness and validate lessons learned from data provided by the RFMDS.\n\nA typical flag exercise year includes ten Green Flags (a close air support (CAS) exercise with the U.S. Army), one Canadian Maple Flag (operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force) and four Red Flags. Each Red Flag exercise normally involves a variety of fighter interdiction, attack/strike, air superiority, enemy air defense suppression, airlift, air refueling and reconnaissance missions. In a 12-month period, more than 500 aircraft fly more than 20,000 sorties, while training more than 5,000 aircrews and 14,000 support and maintenance personnel.\n\nBefore a \"flag\" begins, the Red Flagstaff conducts a planning conference where unit representatives and planning staff members develop the size and scope of their participation. All aspects of the exercise, including billeting of personnel, transportation to Nellis AFB, range coordination, ordnance/munitions scheduling, and development of training scenarios, are designed to be as realistic as possible, fully exercising each participating unit's capabilities and objectives.\n\nThe origin of Red Flag was the unacceptable performance of U.S. Air Force fighter pilots and weapon systems officers (WSO) in air-to-air combat (\"air combat maneuvering,\" ACM) during the Vietnam War in comparison to previous wars. Air combat over North Vietnam between 1965 and 1973 led to an overall exchange ratio (ratio of enemy aircraft shot down to the number of own aircraft lost to enemy fighters) of 2.2:1 (for a while in June and July 1972 during Operation Linebacker the ratio was less than 1:1).\n\nAmong the several factors resulting in this disparity was a lack of realistic ACM training. USAF pilots and WSOs of the late 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s were not versed in the core values and basics of ACM due to the belief that \"Beyond Visual Range missile\" engagements (BVR) and equipment made \"close-in\" maneuvering in air combat obsolete. As a result of this BVR-only mindset reached its zenith in the early 1960s, nearly all USAF fighter pilots and weapons systems officers (WSO) of the period were unpracticed in maneuvering against dissimilar aircraft because of a concurrent Air Force emphasis on flying safety.\n\nAn Air Force analysis known as Project Red Baron II showed that a pilot's chances of survival in combat dramatically increased after he had completed ten combat missions. As a result, Red Flag was created in 1975 to offer USAF pilots and weapon systems officers the opportunity to fly ten realistically simulated combat missions in a safe training environment with measurable results. Many U.S. aircrews had also fallen victim to SAMs during the Vietnam War, and Red Flag exercises provided pilots and WSOs experience in this regime as well.\n\nThe concept of Colonel Richard \"Moody\" Suter became the driving force in Red Flag's implementation, persuading the-Tactical Air Command (TAC) commander, General Robert J. Dixon, to adopt the program. At Nellis, Suter was well-known and well-liked. The first Red Flag exercise was conducted on Gen Dixon's schedule in November 1975. On 1 March 1976, the 4440th Tactical Fighter Training Group (Red Flag) was chartered with Col P.J. White as the first commander, Lt Col Marty Mahrt, as vice commander Lt Col David Burner as Director of Operations. This small crew under Col White's leadership undertook the task of firmly establishing the program.\nThe \"aggressor squadrons\", the opponents who flew against the pilots undergoing training, were selected from the top fighter pilots in the U.S. Air Force. These pilots were trained to operate according to the tactical doctrines of the Soviet Union and other enemies of the period, to better simulate what then-TAC, as well as USAFE, PACAF and other NATO pilots and WSOs would likely encounter in real combat against a Warsaw Pact or other Soviet-proxy adversary. The aggressors were initially being equipped with readily available T-38 Talon aircraft to simulate Mikoyan MiG-21, the T-38 being similar in terms of size and performance. F-5 Tiger II fighters, painted in color schemes commonly found on Soviet aircraft, were added shortly after that and became the mainstay until the F-16 was introduced.\n\nToday, the 414th Combat Training Squadron (414 CTS) is the unit currently tasked with running Red Flag exercises, while the 64th Aggressor Squadron (64 AGRS) also based at Nellis AFB uses F-16 aircraft to emulate the MiG-29 Fulcrum. These aircraft continue to be painted in the various camouflage schemes of potential adversaries. An additional squadron at Nellis, the 65th Aggressor Squadron (65 AGRS), operated F-15 aircraft in various camouflage schemes of potential adversaries to replicate Su-27 Flanker and Su-35 Flanker threats. However, the 65 AGRS was inactivated on 26 September 2014 due to the Fiscal Year 2015 budget constraints imposed upon the Air Force that zero-lined the squadron's budget.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a similar large-force training exercise known as Air Wing Fallon at NAS Fallon and the Fallon Range Training Complex in northern Nevada. Air Wing Fallon is a month-long evolution designed to enhance a carrier air wing's war-fighting ability in both the air-to-air and air-to-ground arenas, with the primary focus being for the air wing to become familiar with the complexity of a massive force strike (LFS). Previously under the aegis of \"Strike University\" (STRIKE U), an O-6 level command when it was formed in 1984, \"Strike U\" was later merged with the fighter community's TOPGUN and the carrier airborne early warning community's TOP DOME following those organization's 1993 BRAC-directed relocation from the former NAS Miramar, California, forming the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) under the command of naval aviation flag officer at NAS Fallon in July 1996. NSAWC then became the executive agent for Air Wing Fallon.\n\nIn the 2010s, NSAWC incorporated the electronic attack community's HAVOC directorate, and in 2016, NSAWC was re-designated as the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC). The Commander of NAWDC at NAS Fallon, the Commander of USAFWC at Nellis AFB, and their respective subordinate units and staffs maintain natural rapport with each other in areas of shared equities and the tactical development of the Joint Force.\n\nRed Flag and Air Wing Fallon should not be confused with smaller, but longer duration, programs that the USAF and USN run to train individual weapons and tactics instructors. In 2009, the 416th Flight Test Squadron from Edwards AFB, California, participated in Red Flag as well, the first time an Air Force Material Command (AFMC) unit had been part of the program.\n\nOnly countries considered friendly towards the United States take part in Red Flag exercises. So far, the countries to have participated in these exercises are:\n\nRed Flag was depicted in a 1981 made-for-TV movie, \"Red Flag: The Ultimate Game\". Red Flag is also featured in a 2004 IMAX film, \"\". A set of add-on modules depicting a standard Red Flag campaign is available for the PC flying combat Simulator \"Digital Combat Simulator\". It allows the player to pilot an A-10C, AJS-37, F-5E, F-15C, F/A-18C or M2000C as both Blue and Red Forces.\n\n\n"}

During his rule, he controlled the greater part of the regions around the Taurus Mountains, and invested much of his efforts in cultivating the lands and rebuilding the towns within his domain. He provided ample provisions to the Crusaders, for example during the difficult period of the siege of Antioch in the winter of 1097. He was a passionate adherent of the separated Armenian Church.\n\nHe was the son of Roupen I; his father declared the independence of Cilicia from the Byzantine Empire around 1080. According to the chroniclers Matthew of Edessa and Sempat Sparapet, Constantine is also identified as being either a prince of King Gagik II, or some kind of a military commander in the monarch’s clan in exile. \n\nUpon the murder of King Gagik II, Constantine’s father gathered his family and fled to the Taurus Mountains and took refuge in the fortress of Kopitar (Kosidar) situated north of Sis (today \"Kozan\" in Turkey). As Roupen was growing old by 1090, his command seems to have passed entirely to Constantine; and it was the latter who in the same year conquered the strategic Cilician castle of Vahka (today \"Feke\" in Turkey). The mastery of this mountain defile made possible the assessment of taxes on merchandise transported from the port of Ayas towards the central part of Asia Minor, a source of wealth to which the Roupenians owed their power.\n\nAfter his father’s death in 1095, Constantine extended his power eastward towards the Anti-Taurus Mountains. As an Armenian Christian ruler in the Levant, he helped the forces of the First Crusade maintain the siege of Antioch until it fell to the crusaders. The crusaders, for their part, duly appreciated the aid of their Armenian allies: Constantin was honored with the titles of \"Comes\" and \"Baron\".\n\nThe \"Chronographie\" of Samuel of Ani records that Constantine died soon after a lightning bolt struck his table in the fortress of Vahka. He was buried in Castalon.\n\nAccording to the Chronicle of Aleppo, his wife was descended from Bardas Phokas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1992540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992540", "title": "Busher Jackson", "text": "Busher Jackson\n\nRalph Harvey \"Busher\" Jackson (January 17, 1911June 25, 1966) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. Jackson played 15 National Hockey League (NHL) seasons between 1929 and 1944 for the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Americans, and Boston Bruins. He was a member of the Maple Leafs' famed Kid Line with Joe Primeau and Charlie Conacher, one of the early NHL's dominant scoring trios. Jackson led the league in scoring in 1931–32 and was a member of Toronto's 1932 Stanley Cup championship team. He was named to five NHL All-Star Teams and played in three benefit All-Star Games, including the Ace Bailey Benefit Game, the first All-Star contest in NHL history.\n\nOff the ice, Jackson was well-known for his high-spending lifestyle and drinking habit that prompted his trade from Toronto to New York in 1939. He was remembered as one of hockey's tragic figures following his retirement, as he struggled with alcoholism and financial difficulty. In the 1960s, Jackson was a figure of controversy within the Hockey Hall of Fame selection committee, as the Hall used his lifestyle and personal problems to block his induction. He finally earned a place in the Hall of Fame in 1971, five years after his death. Jackson is also an honoured member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, which he was inducted into in 1975. He was the brother of fellow NHL player Art Jackson.\n\nJackson grew up in Toronto, playing his youth hockey at \"Poverty Pond\" in the city's east side before playing at the Ravina Rink where he was discovered by Frank Selke, the assistant general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Selke signed Jackson to a contract and assigned him to the Toronto Marlboros in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA)'s junior league for the 1927–28 season. Jackson scored four goals in four regular season games that season, and though the Marlboros were considered a favourite to win the Memorial Cup, the team was defeated in the Eastern final by the Ottawa Gunners. He returned to the team for the 1928–29 season, scoring 10 goals and 14 points in 9 regular season games. He then led the OHA playoffs with seven goals and nine points as the Marlboros won the OHA championship. Jackson was a leading offensive player for Toronto in the 1929 Memorial Cup playdowns, scoring 15 goals and 25 points in 13 games. The Marlboros reached the final, defeating the Elmwood Millionaires in a best-of-three series to win the franchise's first Memorial Cup championship.\n\nJoining the Maple Leafs for the 1929–30 season, the 18-year-old Jackson was the youngest player in the National Hockey League (NHL). In his league debut against the Montreal Canadiens, Jackson knocked over his idol Howie Morenz with a bodycheck. Assessing the youngster's potential following the hit, Morenz offered, \"you'll do.\" Jackson appeared in 31 games for the Leafs, scoring 12 goals and adding 6 assists. He missed some time due to injury, during which he earned his nickname from the team's trainer, Tim Daly. According to Jackson: \"Daly asked me to carry sticks for him. I told him I wasn't a stick boy, I was a hockey player. So he said I was nothing but a fresh busher [a term for someone who had just been called up from the minors] and the name stuck.\"\n\nDuring his first season, Jackson was placed on a line with two other young players. Charlie Conacher, a teammate of his with the Marlboros, played right wing and Joe Primeau was their centre. The trio formed what became known as the \"Kid Line,\" one of the early NHL's most famous scoring trios. Primeau was the line's playmaker, whose passes set up both Conacher and Jackson's goal-scoring ability.\nFollowing a 31-point season in 1930–31, Jackson led the NHL in scoring with 53 points in 1931–32. At 21 years, 3 months old, he became the youngest scoring champion in NHL history, a record he would hold until 1980–81, when it was broken by Wayne Gretzky. Jackson's 28 goals that season was the most he would score in his career, and he was named to the NHL's First All-Star Team for the first time of his career. He added five goals in the 1932 playoffs, including one of Toronto's six in the deciding game of the 1932 Stanley Cup Final, a 6–4 victory over the New York Rangers that clinched Toronto's first Stanley Cup championship since 1922.\n\nThe Kid Line remained Toronto's top offensive threat for several years; Jackson, Conacher and Primeau were the team's top three scorers for four consecutive seasons between 1932 and 1935. Following his league-leading season, Jackson led Toronto offensively in 1932–33 with 44 points. On November 20, 1934, Jackson set an NHL record when he became the first player in NHL history to score four goals in a period, notching four markers in the third period of a 5–2 victory over the St. Louis Eagles. The record has not been surpassed through 2019, though eleven players have matched it. He was named to three additional All-Star Teams during this time, placed on the second team in 1932–33 and on the first team in both 1933–34 and 1934–35. Additionally, Jackson played in the Ace Bailey Benefit Game on February 14, 1934. Held in support of injured teammate Ace Bailey, it was the first all-star game in NHL history. Jackson scored two goals for the Maple Leafs in a 7–3 victory over the NHL All-Stars.\n\nFollowing four consecutive 20-goal seasons, Jackson slipped to 11 goals in 1935–36. The Kid Line was finally broken up. While they remained consistent offensive performers, they lacked defensive ability and opposing teams began to find success playing their own top scoring lines against the trio. Primeau subsequently retired in 1936 in favour of his business interests. Despite the break-up, Jackson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 1936–37 to earn his fourth and final appearance on the First All-Star Team.\n\nPrior to the start of the 1937–38 season, Jackson played with the NHL All-Stars in the Howie Morenz Memorial Game, the NHL's second benefit all-star contest. In regular league play, his offence entered a decline as he scored 34 points that season, then 27 in 1938–39. \nFollowing the season, the Maple Leafs traded him to the New York Americans along with Jimmy Fowler, Murray Armstrong, Doc Romnes and Buzz Boll in exchange for Sweeney Schriner on May 18, 1939. The five-for-one deal was unprecedented in NHL history at that time.\n\nPrior to his first season in New York, Jackson played in his third benefit all-star game, the Babe Siebert Memorial Game, on October 29, 1939. He represented the NHL All-Stars in a 5–2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. In NHL play, he posted 12 goals and 20 points for the Americans, then improved to 26 points in 1940–41. He was unable to come to terms with team manager Red Dutton on a new contract for the 1941–42 season however, and did not join the team at the start of the season. The impasse lasted for half the season, until Dutton sold Jackson's rights to the Boston Bruins for $7,500 on January 4, 1942.\n\nJoining the Bruins gave Jackson the opportunity to play alongside his younger brother Art. He played only 26 games that season due to his holdout, just over half of an NHL season of 48 games, scoring 12 points. Though he played the left wing throughout his career, the Bruins switched him part-time to defence when they lost players to injury or the Second World War. He scored 34 points in 1942–43, and his 19 goals was Jackson's highest total in six seasons. The Bruins reached the 1943 Stanley Cup Final by defeating Montreal, but lost the series to the Detroit Red Wings in four straight games. Jackson's playoff overtime goal on March 25, 1943, at the Forum would turn out to be the last Boston playoff overtime goal in Montreal until 1992. Jackson played a final season in 1943–44, after which he announced his retirement as a player following a 15-year career.\n\nA handsome man with even features, Jackson lived the lifestyle of a Hollywood actor during his playing career, spending money freely, driving fast cars, and attending posh parties. Maple Leafs' owner Conn Smythe unsuccessfully tried to convince Jackson to save his money for the future, even offering to match his player's savings dollar for dollar. Jackson's habits, particularly his drinking, ultimately played a role in his trade away from Toronto. Jackson's lifestyle came crashing down following his retirement as a player, as he no longer had the money to fund his pursuits. He unsuccessfully tried to overcome his alcoholism, lost two marriages to divorce, struggled to hold a job, and it was said that he could be found outside Maple Leaf Gardens trying to sell broken sticks of Maple Leaf players to try to make some money. He emerged as one of hockey's tragic figures.\n\nJackson suffered a series of injuries and ailments in his later years. In 1958, he broke his neck after falling down a flight of stairs. His recovery took 18 months and cost him mobility in his right hand. Two months after his release, Jackson returned to hospital with a bout of jaundice. He was hospitalized again in 1962 following an epileptic seizure.\n\nAs Jackson's health failed, he became the focus of a controversy within the Hockey Hall of Fame selection committee. Though he was considered one of hockey's greatest left wingers and was famed for his attacking style of play and backhand shot, Jackson's personal problems led Hall chairman Conn Smythe to blacklist him from entry. Though Primeau and Conacher had gained induction, Jackson died on June 25, 1966, without being given the same honour. It would be another five years until the remainder of the selection committee finally overruled Smythe and posthumously inducted Jackson into the Hall of Fame in 1971. Smythe quit the committee in protest, while Jackson's son Kim accepted the honour on his father's behalf. In 1975, Jackson was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, and \"The Hockey News\" ranked him 55th in its 1997 book, \"The Top 100 NHL players of All-Time\".\n"}

It was generally similar to the Mark VIII it replaced, but had a more powerful .4 litre larger engine, 4-wheel disc brakes, and power assisted recirculating ball power steering among its mechanical improvements. \n\nVisually the early versions were identical in exterior appearance to the Mark VIII except for the addition of a chrome \"Mk IX\" badge to the boot lid. Later versions had a larger tail-lamp assembly with an amber section for traffic indication, visually similar to the tail-lights of the smaller Jaguar Mark 2.\n\nIt was replaced by the lower and more contemporary-styled Mark X in 1961.\n\nA four-speed manual system transmission was standard. Options included overdrive and a Borg Warner three-speed automatic box, the most popular choice.\n\nInternally, an enlarged-bore 3.8 L (231 in³), DOHC straight-6 replaced the previous 3.4 L (210 in³) unit. The B-type head of the Mark VIII was retained, but with a chamber at the bottom of the combustion chamber to accommodate the enlarged bore. Twin HD6 1.75\" SU carburettors were fitted. A smaller electromagnetically controlled auxiliary carburettor was placed between the main pair of carburettors to act as a choke. It often proved troublesome in operation and many were converted to manual switching . Standard compression ratio was 8:1, but a higher performance 9:1 compression ratio was also available, as was a 7:1 compression ratio for export markets, such as Africa, where quality of petrol was sometimes a problem.\n\nThe Mark IX was the first production Jaguar to offer four-wheel servo-assisted Dunlop disc brakes and recirculating ball power steering, which were now standard equipment. The brake system included a vacuum reserve tank to preserve braking in the event that the engine stalled. Automatic transmission were fitted with a hill-holding \"anti-creep\" feature, where an electromagnetic valve maintained brake pressure at rest when the brake pedal was released to prevent the car from rolling back on an incline. \n\nThe power steering was driven by a Hobourn-Eaton pump, operating at 600-650 psi. It was attached to the back of the generator and allowed the steering to be geared up to 3.5 turns lock-to-lock as against the 4.5 turns for the Mark VII and VIII models.\n\nUnlike the early automatic Mark VII predecessor, (but like late mark VII and all Mark VIII) the Borg Warner DG automatic gearbox started in first gear and had a dash-mounted switch to allow second gear to be held indefinitely. Once in third gear, a series of clutches engaged to allow direct drive rather than through the torque converter.\n\nThe torsion bar independent front suspension and leaf-sprung rear live axle were retained from the Mk VIII, which, in turn, was first used in the 1949 Mark V.\n\nFinal drive was 4.27:1, (4.55:1 when overdrive was fitted).\n\nThe sunshine roof became a standard fitting for the UK market. The interior was luxurious, with extensive use of leather, burled walnut and deep pile carpet. A range of single and duo-tone paint schemes was offered.\n\nA car with automatic transmission tested by the British magazine \"The Motor\" in 1958 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 11.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £2162 including taxes of £721. In addition, the Mark IX attained 30 mph in 4.2 seconds, and 100 mph in 34.8 secs. It covered the standing quarter mile in 18.1 secs.\n\nAutocar magazine tested a Mk IX Automatic in its Used Cars on the Road series, number 200, published in the edition dated 14 December 1962. This vehicle at the recorded mileage of around 34,000 achieved acceleration figures of 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 10.1 secs and 0-100 mph (161 km/h) in 28.8 secs. The Standing Quarter-mile was passed in 17.6 secs.\n\nThe Mark IX was popular as a state car. When Charles de Gaulle paid a state visit to Canada in 1960, the official cars for the motorcade were Mark IX Jaguars. The British Queen Mother had a Jaguar Mark VII, which was progressively upgraded to be externally identical to the later Mark IX. The Nigerian government bought forty Mark IXs, painted in state colours of green and white. The large Jaguars of the 1950s were sufficiently popular in western Africa that \"Jagwah\" survives as a colloquialism for \"smart man-about-town\".\n\nIn the luxury car market, the Jaguar Mk IX was very competitively priced, selling for £1995 with manual gearbox, £2063 with overdrive, and £2163 with automatic transmission, which was less than half the price of similar competitors. In all, 10,009 were produced.\n\nThe Mark IX's power and good brakes for a vehicle of the era, together with its impressive aesthetic appearance, make it a common choice for classic car circuit racing, such as at the Goodwood Circuit's Revival meetings.\n\n"}

The AVA encompasses an area of approximately in the Yadkin River valley. The Yadkin Valley AVA includes all of Wilkes, Surry, and Yadkin counties, and parts of Davie, Davidson, Forsyth, Iredell, and Stokes counties. Yadkin Valley is home to more than three dozen wineries.\n\nFor decades, the area was a key tobacco-growing region. However, as tobacco farming and cigarette manufacturing in the area declined, some entrepreneurs, including tobacco farmers, have turned to winemaking. The native grapes of this region of the southeastern United States include \"Vitis cordifolia\", \"Vitis labrusca\", \"Vitis aestivalis\", \"Vitis cinerea\", and \"Vitis rotundifolia\" (muscadine and scuppernong). Early attempts to grow the European wine grape, \"Vitis vinifera\", in the southeastern United States, including 18th century efforts by Thomas Jefferson at Monticello, Virginia, had mixed success. But in the past two to three decades, viticultural research has helped these grapes to survive the climate, soil, and pests of the region. Additionally, Surry Community College, located in Dobson, North Carolina, has served as a valuable community resource for this growing industry by offering certificate and degree programs in viticulture and enology. In 2005, Davidson County Community College formed a partnership with Surry Community College for the delivery of the viticulture and enology program/certifications in Davidson and Davie counties.\n\nIn 2003, in an effort led by Charlie and Ed Shelton of Shelton Vineyards, the United States' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives approved the new appellation for the region with the name Yadkin Valley AVA, allowing winemakers to bottle wines with a label indicating that the wine came from the Yadkin Valley. In 2005, there were 14 wineries and of vineyards in the region. By 2005, the number of wine producers had increased to 23. By 2013, there were 38 wineries operating in the Yadkin Valley.\n\nThe Yadkin Valley area is in the piedmont and foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. One of the most recognizable landmarks in the AVA is Pilot Mountain. The hardiness zone is mostly 7a and 7b, with 6b in some higher areas.\n\n\"Southern Living\" Magazine published a feature story about the Yadkin Valley region in November 2007.\n\nThe Yadkin Valley Wine Festival is traditionally held the third Saturday in May at the Municipal Park in Elkin. The Yadkin Valley Grape Festival is held the third Saturday in October in Yadkinville. The 'Shine to Wine Festival is held in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina the first Saturday in May.

The unified river then flows southwest through Dale and Geneva counties into Florida, collecting tributaries along the way: the Little Choctawhatchee River in Dale County, and the Pea River near Geneva. It then flows south into Florida, terminating at Choctawhatchee Bay. Other Alabama tributaries are Claybank Creek and Tight Eye Creek.\n\nOnce in Florida, the river continues southwesterly through Holmes, Walton and Bay counties until reaching its namesake bay. Major tributaries in Florida include Holmes, Wright, Sandy, Pine Log, Seven Run and Bruce creeks.

As recently as the 1920s, sturgeon fishing was a thriving industry in Geneva, with many large fish being caught, packed in barrels, and shipped north.\n\nTwenty-one Aquatic Snails and Freshwater Mussel species exist in the Choctawhatchee, with one of the former and two of the latter found only in this particular river.\n\nResearchers from Auburn University and the University of Windsor, Ontario, reported possible sightings in 2005 and 2006 of ivory-billed woodpeckers along the Choctawhatchee River.\n\n70% of the Choctawhatchee's watershed is forested; the remainder is mostly croplands and pasture. Trees found along the Choctawhatchee include southern pine, beech, magnolia, laurel oak, basswood, Florida maple and American holly. The lower Choctawhatchee contains \"pitcher-plant bog\" and other swamp habitat, including cypress trees draped with Spanish moss. Alligators are found in the river's lower reaches.\n\nThe Choctawhatchee has little industry along its banks; consequently it has rather clean water, except for excess turbidity, usually due to runoff from unpaved county roads. The Choctawhatchee, Pea and Yellow Rivers Watershed Management District was instrumental in getting a grant to place gravel on many county roads, which reduced the average turbidity. Illegal dumping of household garbage and animal carcasses is a problem, but not enough of one to seriously affect water quality in the Alabama portion of the river, where water quality is described as \"good to very good\". This changes somewhat in the Florida section of the river, due to the presence of several wastewater treatment plants, animal-waste sites and erosion. Three of the river's Florida tributaries are described as \"polluted\" with \"waste water effluent\".\n\nThe Choctawhatchee has not always been on good behavior, having flooded Geneva in the so-called \"Lincoln Freshet\" of 1865, and the Hoover Flood of 1929. The Lincoln Freshet induced many of the townspeople to move to higher ground approximately a half-mile north, while the Hoover Flood swept away most of the remnants of Old Town Geneva. Damage from subsequent floods has been limited by a WPA-project levee. Areas outside the levee did not fare so well, and were purchased by FEMA after three floods during the 1990s. The March 1990 flood caused over $88 million in damages.\n\nA natural inland waterway connects Choctawhatchee Bay to Pensacola Bay, making it possible for keelboats and later steamboats to navigate between Pensacola, Florida and Geneva, Alabama, and as far upstream as Newton. Before that, the river was a supply route and avenue of commerce for thousands of years to the indigenous peoples of the area.\n\nSam Story, also known as \"Timpoochee Kinnard,\" was chief of a band of Euchee (Yuchi) Indians in the early 19th century in present-day Walton County. They occupied lands on and to the west of the Choctawhatchee River. His parents were a Yuchi woman, whose name is not known, and Timothy Kinnard, a white man of Scottish descent, who had come to the area as a trader. According to the matrilineal system of the Yuchi, Sam was considered born to his mother's people and he was raised as Yuchi. The chief became a well-known figure in the Florida Panhandle and was highly respected by whites. Following the United States' acquisition of this territory in 1821 from Spain, European Americans entered the panhandle in greater numbers, encroaching on Euchee and Creek territory.\n\nIn 1814 Andrew Jackson built a stockade called the \"Block House\" at the confluence of the East and West forks of the Chocktawhatchee, near Newton.\n\nEuropean-American settlers also used the river in their time, from the years of the earliest land patents around Geneva (1841) until the late 1930s. The \"Bloomer\", a 130-ton side-wheeler with high-pressure engines, navigated the route between Geneva and Pensacola in 1857, as did the \"Brooklyn\", a steamboat built in Geneva.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the Confederate steamboat \"Bloomer\" was the object of an 1862 raid by 25 Union soldiers of the 91st New York State Volunteers, who were stationed at Fort Pickens near Pensacola. This attack was led by Lt. James H. Stewart, assisted by Acting Master Elias D. Bruner, of the \"USS Charlotte (1862)\", along with Acting Ensign Edward Crissey. They seized the steamboat in Geneva without firing a shot, and sailed it down the Choctawhatchee to the Bay.\n\nThe Choctawhatchee is a popular river with canoeists, although access to the upper portions is difficult. The Canoe-Camping website named the Choctawhatchee \"an undiscovered gem\", and \"a beauty\", heartily recommending it to canoeists. Several public access points and camping sites make the river accessible for recreation.\n\n\n"}

Afflis played football during his freshman and sophomore years for Shortridge High School in Indianapolis. After his mother lost her job, the family moved back to Delphi, and the high school there did not have a football team. Afflis took up residence at the YMCA in nearby Lafayette, Indiana, so that he was eligible to attend Lafayette Jefferson High School where he played football and wrestled.\n\nAfflis went on to attend Purdue University and the University of Nevada, Reno, playing varsity football at both schools. He also worked as a bouncer at a Reno nightclub.\n\nSelected 186th overall in the 16th round of the 1951 professional football draft, Afflis played football for the Green Bay Packers from 1951 to 1954. as a lineman. He appeared in all 48 regular season games the Packers played in those years, although the team never finished better than fourth place. Afflis suffered an injury to his larynx while playing for the Packers that left him with a gravelly voice for the rest of his life.\n\nAfflis started wrestling in Chicago in 1955 under the Bruiser moniker where he faced Verne Gagne and Lou Thesz. Gagne had trained him to become a professional wrestler.\n\nFrom then into the late 1950s, Dick the Bruiser wrestled live every Thursday on TV in the Detroit area. His typical opponent was \"an up and coming young (unknown) wrestler\" who would be pulverized by the Bruiser. His matches and interviews were so effective he became a household name in the Detroit area. His only defeat on live TV was at the hands of “Cowboy” Bob Ellis. However, in two rematches with Ellis at the Olympia in Detroit, the Bruiser was victorious. A real bar fight with football player Alex Karras gained Afflis attention, which resulted in several more fights.\n\nOn November 19, 1957, Dick the Bruiser and Dr. Jerry Graham engaged in a tag team match at Madison Square Garden in New York City before a crowd reported as 12,987 fans. Their opponents were Antonino Rocca and Édouard Carpentier. After the match ended, fighting among the wrestlers continued, and a large number of fans joined in, leading to a riot. Two policemen were injured, two fans were arrested and over 60 policemen had difficulty dispersing the angry crowd. The floor of the arena was littered with hundreds of broken chairs. As a result, Dick the Bruiser was banned for life by the New York State Athletic Commission.\nAfflis, along with fellow wrestler and business partner Wilbur Snyder, purchased the Indianapolis NWA promotion in 1964 from its longtime owner Jim Barnett. Afflis renamed the territory the World Wrestling Association (WWA) and promoted himself as its champion. While he ran it as an independent promotion with its own titles and champion, the WWA had a working agreement with the larger AWA (owned by wrestler Verne Gagne), sharing talent and recognizing their championships. This agreement benefited both promotions and led to the Bruiser having five AWA Tag-Team Title reigns, with tag team partner, The Crusher, who was billed as his \"cousin\".\n\nThe Bruiser was the first to christen Manager Bobby Heenan with the nickname of \"The Weasel\" during his run in the territory. Afflis' WWA ran from 1964 until 1989, when Afflis finally tired of losing talent, TV, and fan attendance to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nAfflis, with his charisma, NFL notoriety, and gravelly-voiced, tough-guy persona was a legitimate cross-media star, becoming something of a hero in the Indianapolis area. He made his home on the northwest side of the city. Indianapolis native David Letterman would later name his television show's band The World's Most Dangerous Band as a derivation of Dick the Bruiser's nickname, \"The World's Most Dangerous Wrestler.\" The moniker \"Dick the Bruiser\" was even used in the 1980s by George Baier, a co-host of the morning drive show on Detroit rock radio station WRIF. Baier's \"Richard T. Bruiser\" was an effective, entertaining impersonation of Afflis, who actually played himself in a number of popular TV ads for WRIF.\n\nAfter retiring, Afflis was a color commentator for the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW), founded by David McLane, who had previously risen through the ranks as a teenager to manage the WWA for The Bruiser. He also worked as a talent agent for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and was the special guest referee at the Starrcade 1990 main event between Sting and the Black Scorpion.\n\nAfflis died of internal bleeding on November 10, 1991, according to a spokesman for Suncoast Hospital in Largo, Florida, near his winter home. His widow, Louise, said her husband had been weightlifting at home with his adopted son, Jon Carney, and ruptured a blood vessel in his esophagus. He was entombed at Washington Park North Cemetery in Indianapolis.\n\nHis son in law wrestles as Dick the Bruiser Jr in the independent circuit. As of 2019 he still wrestles at 67. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1992614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992614", "title": "Francesinha", "text": "Francesinha\n\nFrancesinha (meaning \"Little Frenchie\" or simply \"Frenchie\" in Portuguese) is a Portuguese sandwich originally from Porto, made with bread, wet-cured ham, linguiça, fresh sausage like chipolata, steak or roast meat, and covered with melted cheese and a hot and thick spiced tomato and beer sauce. It is typically served with french fries.\n\nDaniel da Silva, a returned emigrant from France and Belgium, tried to adapt the croque-monsieur to the Portuguese taste when he moved to Porto. He first created the special sauce and populated the sandwich with local meats in 1953 at 'A \"Regaleira\"', a restaurant in Rua do Bonjardim, Porto; the Francesinha quickly became a very popular dish and deeply associated with the city, although it can sometimes be found elsewhere in Portugal. A classic francesinha meal would include the sandwich, surrounded on a bed of chips doused in the famous , and complemented with a \"fino\", which in this context refers to draught beer.\n\nLocals will have their favorite restaurant with the best Francesinha in town, typically arguing about the quality of the sauce (a secret recipe that varies by restaurant) and the quality of the meats.\n\nPorto and its surroundings is the traditional area of the francesinha, with many restaurants and cafés serving it. It can also be easily found in several other places across the north of Portugal. In the center and south of Portugal it may be harder to find, but there are an increasing number of restaurants, bars, and cafés serving it, especially in tourist destinations like beach resorts ranging from Figueira da Foz to Albufeira. In Lisbon, a number of bars and restaurants serve varied types of \"francesinha\", including variations served with green sauce. Francesinha standard sauce bottles have been sold in supermarkets across the entire country since the 2000s, which may be related with a growth of the sandwich's popularity outside Porto Metropolitan Area.\n\nThere is no standard recipe for the francesinha. Different restaurants in Portugal have special variations, such as:\n\n\nThe Francesinha Especial \"(Special Francesinha)\" is a Francesinha with egg and / or potato chips. Other variations of the original include fillings such as pork, chicken, pastrami, tuna, codfish and vegetarian options.\n\nFrancesinha sauce is a secret, with each establishment having its variation. The only common ingredient is beer. Most, though not all, sauces are tomato based and vary in their degree of spiciness. The color is usually red or orange. Different restaurants that serve Francesinha are characterized based on how good their sauce and mix of meats is perceived to be.\n\n\"Francesinha poveira\" is a form of francesinha distinctive to Póvoa de Varzim, north of Porto. Also created in the early 1960s. The poveira form uses different bread and sauce to form a sandwich that can be eaten by hand.\n\n\"Pica-pau\" is a breadless variant in which a steak is cut into bite-sized pieces and covered with sauce. The name \"pica-pau\" (woodpecker) references the traditional means of consumption with small skewers or toothpicks—making the diner \"peck\" at the dish.\n\n\"The Daily Meal\" included the francesinha in their article \"12 Life-Changing Sandwiches You've Never Heard Of\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1992630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992630", "title": "Brachypelma smithi", "text": "Brachypelma smithi\n\nBrachypelma smithi is a species of spider in the family Theraphosidae (tarantulas) native to Mexico. It has been confused with \"Brachypelma hamorii\"; both have been called Mexican redknee tarantulas. Mexican redknee tarantulas are a popular choice as pets among tarantula keepers. Many earlier sources referring to \"B. smithi\" either relate to \"B. hamorii\" or do not distinguish between the two species. \"B. smithi\" is a terrestrial tarantula native to Pacific coast of the Mexican state of Guerrero.\n\n\"Brachypelma smithi\" is a large spider. A sample of seven females had a total body length (excluding chelicerae and spinnerets) in the range . A sample of eight males were slightly smaller, with a total body length in the range . Although males have slightly shorter bodies, they have longer legs. The fourth leg is the longest, measuring in the type male and in a female. The legs and palps are bluish black with three distinctly colored rings: dark reddish orange on the part of the patellae closest to the body with light yellowish pink further away, pale yellowish pink on the lower part of the tibiae, and pinkish white at the end of the metatarsi. Adult males have a yellowish brown carapace; the upper surface of the abdomen is black. Adult females vary more in carapace color and pattern. The carapace may be mainly bluish black with a light brown border, or the dark area may be broken up into a \"starburst\" pattern or almost reduced to two dark patches in the eye area.\n\nThe species was first described by Frederick Pickard-Cambridge in 1897 as \"Eurypelma smithi\". It was collected at Dos Arroyos, Guerrero, Mexico, by H. H. Smith. It was transferred to the genus \"Brachypelma\" by Reginald Pocock in 1903. Pickard-Cambridge identified the type specimen as a female, but in 1968 it was noticed that it was actually an immature male. In 1994, A. M. Smith confirmed that the holotype was an immature male, and redescribed the species using two different specimens: an adult male and an adult female. The specimens he used cannot now be found, but his description makes it clear that they actually belonged to a different species, \"B. hamorii\". Even prior to Smith's description, \"B. hamorii\" had been misidentified as \"B. smithi\".\n\nThe two species have very similar colour patterns. When viewed from above, the chelicerae of \"B. hamorii\" have two brownish pink bands on a greyish background, not visible on all individuals. \"B. smithi\" lacks these bands. Mature males of the two species can be distinguished by the shape of the palpal bulb. That of \"B. smithi\" is straighter with a broad spoon shape when viewed retrolaterally and a wider keel at the apex. In mature females of \"B. smithi\" the baseplate of the spermatheca is divided and subtriangular, rather than elliptical as in \"B. hamorii\"; also the ventral face of the spermatheca is striated rather than smooth.\n\n\"Brachypelma annitha\" was described as a separate species in 1997, but is now considered to be conspecific with \"B. smithi\".\n\nDNA barcoding has been applied to some Mexican species of \"Brachypelma\". In this approach, a portion of about 650 base pairs of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) is used, primarily to identify existing species, but also sometimes to support a separation between species. In 2017, Mendoza and Francke showed that although \"B. smithi\" and \"B. hamorii\" are similar in superficial external appearance, they are clearly distinguished both by some finer aspects of morphology and by their DNA barcodes, although the supposed species \"B. annitha\" is nested within \"B. smithii\".\n\n\"Brachypelma smithi\" and the very similar \"B. hamorii\" are found along the Pacific coast of Mexico on opposite sides of the Balsas River basin as it opens onto the Pacific. \"B. smithi\" is found to the south, in the state of Guerrero. The natural habitat of the species is in hilly deciduous tropical forests. It constructs or extends burrows under rocks and tree roots, among dense thickets and deciduous forests.\n\nThe burrows were described in 1999 by a source which did not distinguish between \"Brachypelma hamorii\" and \"B. smithi\". The deep burrows keep them protected from predators, like the white-nosed coati, and enable them to ambush passing prey. The females spend the majority of their lives in their burrows. The burrows are typically located in or not far from vegetation and consist of a single entrance with a tunnel leading to one or two chambers. The entrance is just slightly larger than the body size of the spider. The tunnel, usually about three times the tarantula's leg span in length, leads to a chamber which is large enough for the spider to safely molt. Further down the burrow, via a shorter tunnel, a larger chamber is located where the spider rests and eats its prey. When the tarantula needs privacy, e.g. when molting or laying eggs, the entrance is sealed with silk, sometimes supplemented with soil and leaves.\n\nIn 1985, \"B. smithi\" (then not distinguished from \"B. hamorii\") was placed on CITES Appendix II, and in 1994, all remaining \"Brachypelma\" species were added. Large numbers of Mexican redknee tarantulas caught in the wild continue to be smuggled out of Mexico. It is reported that at least 3,000 specimens of Mexican tarantulas were sent to the United States or Europe a few years prior to 2017, most of which were Mexican redknee tarantulas.\n"}
{"id": "1992632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992632", "title": "Moose Johnson", "text": "Moose Johnson\n\nThomas Ernest \"Ernie, Moose\" Johnson (February 26, 1886 – March 25, 1963) was a Canadian ice hockey player whose professional career spanned from 1905 to 1931. \nHe was a member of four Stanley Cup winning teams between 1905 and 1910 with the Montreal Wanderers of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) and later the National Hockey Association (NHA). He moved west, and switched from left wing to defence, in 1911 to join the newly formed Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He spent the following decade playing with the New Westminster Royals, Portland Rosebuds and Victoria Aristocrats where he was named a PCHA first-team all-star eight times and played in the 1916 Stanley Cup Finals with Portland. He later played minor professional hockey in California, Minnesota and Oregon before retiring at the age of 45. Johnson was known for using perhaps the longest stick in the game's history, giving him a 99-inch reach. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1952.\n\nJohnson's playing career began in 1902 in the Montreal City Hockey League where he would, at times, play with his junior, intermediate and senior teams all in the same weekend. He moved on to the Canadian Amateur Hockey League in 1903 and played two seasons with the Montreal Hockey Club, scoring 9 goals in 11 games in that time. He then moved on to join the Montreal Wanderers of the newly formed Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association in 1905, and finished tenth in league scoring with 12 goals. The Wanderers tied with Ottawa HC for the best record in the league with 9–1 records, necessitating a playoff to determine the league champion. Johnson scored a goal in the first game of the two-game, total goal series as Montreal won 9–1 on home ice. Ottawa came back to lead the second game 9–1, and tie the series, but two late goals by Montreal's Lester Patrick gave Montreal the victory, 12–10 on aggregate, to win both the ECAHA championship, and the Stanley Cup as Canada's national amateur champions.\n\nThe ECAHA turned professional in 1906–07, and the Wanderers signed Johnson to a contract. Along with teammates Jack Marshall, Hod Stuart, Frank Glass and Riley Hern, Johnson became the first professional player ever allowed to compete for the Stanley Cup as the Wanderers defended a challenge by the New Glasgow Cubs of the Maritime Hockey League prior to the ECAHA season's start. The Wanderers lost a second challenge for the Cup, this time by the Kenora Thistles in January 1907 but finished the ECAHA season with a perfect 10–0 record to earn the right to challenge Kenora to a return matchup in March. Johnson improved to 15 goals in 10 games during the season, and was named to the second all-star team on left wing. He scored five more goals in the six games played over three Stanley Cup challenges, including two in the final game of the second series against Kenora to help the Wanderers regain control of the Cup.\n\nJohnson was again named to the second all-star team on left wing in 1907–08. His offence fell in the ECAHA season, as he recorded nine goals in 10 games for the ECAHA champion Wanderers, but he added 11 goals in five Stanley Cup challenge games as the Wanderers successfully defended their title on three occasions. Johnson was an offensive star in the challenges, scoring four goals on one game against the Ottawa Victorias in a January 1908 challenge, and again scoring four in a game against the Winnipeg Maple Leafs in a March 1908 challenge. He ended the season by scoring the game-winning goal in a single game challenge by the Toronto Professionals just days after Montreal had defeated Winnipeg. He scored one goal as Montreal again defended the Stanley Cup against the Edmonton Eskimos in a challenge that preceded the 1908–08 ECAHA season, and added ten more during the campaign, but Montreal lost the league title to Ottawa, and with it control of the Stanley Cup.\n\nIn 1909–10, the Wanderers jumped to the newly formed National Hockey Association (NHA). Johnson scored seven goals during the season to help the Wanderers win the inaugural league championship, and consequently re-capture the Stanley Cup from Ottawa. The victory marked the fourth time Johnson and the Wanderers had won the trophy since 1905. Johnson completed his second NHA season in 1910–11, scoring six goals and recording 60 penalty minutes in 16 games.\n\nJohnson grew up in the same neighbourhood of Pointe-Saint-Charles in Montreal as fellow Wanderers player Frank \"Pud\" Glass. The two were inseparable companions off the ice and also teamed well together on the ice. Johnson and Glass played together on the 1902–03 Montreal St. Lawrence team in the Montreal City Hockey League before rejoining in the 1906 season on the Montreal Wanderers. At the onset of the 1905–06 season Brooklyn Skating Club manager Tom Howard tried to acquire both Johnson and Glass to his club, but the AAHL rules committee ruled the Canadians ineligible to play with the American club on counts of professionalism.\n\nWhen Lester and Frank Patrick formed the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) in 1911, they sought to lure the NHA's top stars out west. Johnson, by then considered one of the game's best players, was among the players who jumped at the higher salaries the Patricks were offering. Johnson was placed on the New Westminster Royals, and switched positions from left wing to cover-point (defence). He remained a star on offence, scoring nine goals in 14 games, and was named to the PCHA's first all-star team, as New Westminster won the inaugural PCHA championship. Prior to the 1912–13 season, and despite being branded an \"outlaw\" by the NHA, Johnson appeared ready to return to the Wanderers as he signed a new contract with the eastern team. However, he previously signed a contract with the Royals, and ultimately chose to remain with New Westminster.\n\nJohnson was again named to the all-star team that season, then played a third year in New Westminster in 1913–14 though he missed a month of the season after suffering a deep laceration on his leg during a game. Following the season, he moved to Portland, Oregon when the Royals transferred south to become the Portland Rosebuds. He again made the all-star team in 1915, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. Johnson again faced contract issues prior to the 1915–16 NHA season when he refused to sign Portland's offer, demanding better terms. He eventually signed with Portland, and was reported to have turned down lucrative offers to return to the NHA.\n\nThe Rosebuds won the PCHA championship that season, and in doing so became the first American team to compete for the Stanley Cup. For Johnson, it marked his first in a Stanley Cup final in six years, and was not without controversy. The Rosebuds faced the NHA's Montreal Canadiens, and the entire series was played in Montreal. As a consequence of his jumping to the PCHA in 1911, Montreal Wanderers owner Sam Lichtenhein had won a judgement against Johnson for $2,000 for breach of contract, but it was not enforceable unless he returned to the jurisdiction of Quebec's courts. When it became known that Lichtenhein would gain Johnson's salary for playing in the series, Johnson contemplated refusing to play. He decided to play in the series anyway, and scored one goal in the five game series. The Canadiens won the best-of-five series 3–2.\n\nLester Patrick, managing the Spokane Canaries, thought he had an agreement to secure Johnson's playing rights for the 1916–17 season. Portland had come to verbal agreement with Patrick that they would do so if he would relinquish claims on four players Portland sought to sign. When it was determined that some of those players would not report to Portland, the Rosebuds refused to relinquish Johnson, leading Patrick to claim he had been \"double crossed\". Remaining with the Rosebuds, Johnson posted a career high 21 points in 1916–17.\n\nWhen the Rosebuds relocated to Victoria, British Columbia to become the Victoria Aristocrats, Johnson moved north with the team. His offence had declined since 1917, as he scored only five, six and five points in the following three seasons, and no goals in that third season of 1919–20. He improved to five goals and seven points in 1920–21, and was named a first-team all-star for the eighth time. However, when his play was met with jeers from the home fans in the 1921–22 season, Johnson felt it was time to retire.\n\nJohnson returned to hockey in 1925 when he played a season in the California Professional League before spending the winter of 1926–27 with the Minneapolis Millers of the American Hockey Association. He again returned to the game in 1928–29 with the Portland Buckaroos of the Pacific Coast Hockey League, then played two seasons in the California Hockey League between 1929 and 1931 with the Hollywood Millionaires and then the San Francisco Tigers before retiring for good at the age of 45. Johnson was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1952.\n\nJohnson was one of the most dominant rushing defensemen of the late-1900s and 1910s. Drawing frequent comparisons to Cyclone Taylor – as Brad Park would to Bobby Orr sixty years later – Johnson was noted for his long, smooth skating stride which allowed him to cover a large amount of ice very quickly and contribute to the attack. He was a consistent scoring threat from the back end through his whole career; in his rookie and sophomore seasons with the Wanderers, he was among the top ten goal scorers in the league, and scored eleven goals over five challenge games during the successful 1908 post-season.\n\nJohnson's offensive upside was such that his coaches would occasionally play him on the left wing, as against the Kenora Thistles in a 1907 challenge match. Si Griffis, playing for the Thistles at the time, claimed that it was Johnson's play which determined the Wanderers' victory. In six playoff games that year, Johnson scored five goals.\n\nAlthough he sometimes drew complaints about his inconsistent checking through the first half-decade of his career, Johnson was able to effectively use his speed to break up plays and transition the puck. Nevertheless, Johnson was able to round out his defensive game by the midpoint of his career, and became infamous for his use of the poke check. Combined with his 5'11\" height and 31-inch wingspan, Johnson's use of abnormally long sticks gave him a reach of anywhere from 81 to 99 inches. In this way, he was able to check nine feet of ice at any given time. One of very few players who could do so at the time, Johnson was as capable skating backwards as he was going forwards. His favourite defensive tactic was to face an oncoming puck carrier head on, skating backwards whilst continuously jabbing and poking at the puck.\n\nJohnson's poke check could also be used to force turnovers and generate offensive rushes. Combining good breakaway speed with positional awareness, Johnson would charge an oncoming attacker, use his poke check to strip the player of the puck, bank it off the sideboards and race after it. While on the attack himself, he would often deliberately make as if he were dumping the puck in. Instead, when thirty feet from the opposing net, he would deliberately fire the puck along the boards so that it rimmed around behind the opponent's goalie; however, rather than chase after it, he would subsequently cut across the slot and pick up the puck as it came out the other side.\n\nJohnson was the first hockey player to earn the nickname \"Moose\", and became infamous for his rough style of play – though he was rarely known to be dirty, as contemporaries Sprague Cleghorn and Billy Coutu were. He was the frequent source of injuries on whichever team he played for – while playing for the Portland Rosebuds in 1915, he had his jaw broken, two ribs fractured, two stitches each in his right leg and left ankle, a flattened shin bone and a badly bruised thigh. The prior season with Portland, he received seventeen stitches in one shin after it was laid open to the bone by an opposing players skate, and had his eye loosened in its socket from an especially violent body check. Nevertheless, in tribute to his toughness, Johnson missed only one game in those two seasons. \n\nTo his supporters, Johnson's proneness to injury was a result of his physical style of play and the retaliation that came with it, and he was often touted as a relatively clean player. Notwithstanding, his detractors pointed to a few notable incidents as evidence of his being overbearing, such as when he was involved in a brawl with Frank Patrick of the Vancouver Millionaires while drunk on the ice after a losing effort:\n\n...The climax was reached when Johnson and Patrick came together in the second period, a scrap being started immediately. Previous to this Johnson had checked Patrick across the face...the men came together and it took practically all members of both teams and the referee to pry them apart...The big fellow had made himself disagreeable throughout the game, hacking, checking and doing everything possible to hurt the Vancouver [players]. Not satisfied with this, he had to trip the referee...Johnson then picked his quarrel with Frank Patrick and they came to blows. They rolled over the ice locked in each other's arms and it took quite a bunch of husky fellows to pry them apart.\n\nJohnson accumulated eight seasons where his penalty totals were triple or quadruple the number of games played.\n\nJohnson's gritty play, however, complemented his offensive prowess exceptionally well. He was named to the ECAHA Second All-Star team in 1908, and the PCHA First All-Star Team in 1912, 1913, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1919, and 1921.\n\nJohnson was born in the neighbourhood of Pointe-Saint-Charles in Montreal, Quebec on February 26, 1886. As a 14-year-old in 1900, he suffered an accident in which he survived a 2,300 volt electrical shock, but the incident resulted in the loss of two fingers on his right hand. Upon moving to the pacific coast, Johnson took on a job working for the Union Pacific Railroad, working with the railway during the summers in between hockey seasons. He settled in Portland when his career ended and worked full-time as a brakeman for Union Pacific until he retired to White Rock, British Columbia in 1954. He suffered a stroke in 1961, and died two years later at the age of 77.\n"}

The plot focuses on the relationship between a shy teenaged boy and an ageing eccentric actress.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Ben Marshall is the sensitive son of complacent Robert, a vicar obsessed with ornithology, and domineering Laura, who performs numerous charitable acts while ignoring her family's emotional needs, such as forcing Ben to deliver meals on wheels despite his having no car. Despite her strong religious beliefs, she is having in an affair with Peter, a young curate portraying Jesus Christ in the church pageant she is directing.\n\nLaura refuses to allow Ben to have a mobile phone or hang around people his own age, and uses his driving lessons to be ferried around for her affair with Peter. Miserable, Ben writes poems for Sarah, a girl he knows from church. He reads her his most recent \"Sarah Poem\", but she rejects him.\n\nAt his mother's urging, Ben seeks summer employment to pay for the upkeep of Mr. Fincham, a mental patient Laura has adopted. Ben responds to an ad placed by Dame Evie Walton, an alcoholic, classically trained actress; reduced to a role on a daytime soap opera when her career began to fade, she has not worked since. In search of a companion to assist her in the house and drive her to various appointments, Evie immediately takes to Ben and offers him the position.\n\nWhen Laura refuses to allow Ben to take a camping trip with Evie, she suggests they take a drive in the country instead, then \"swallows\" the car key when they find an idyllic spot for a campsite. In th morning, she announces Ben must drive her to the Edinburgh International Book Festival, where she has been invited to read poetry. Their road trip provides an epiphany for Ben, who has his first sexual experience with Bryony, one of the young women organizing the event. He learns the importance of accepting responsibility and honouring commitments, and finds the inner strength to stand up for himself.\n\nReturning home, Ben is interrogated by Laura, who believes Evie has \"corrupted\" him. Evie comes to visit, but is rebuffed by Laura. Ben discovers this, and in a fit of rebellion walks offstage during the pageant, riding his bike to Evie's house where the two friends reconcile.\n\nEvie arrives at the Pageant and, \"portraying\" the part of God, whips the crowd into a religious frenzy, allowing Ben to join her in the car park. Laura chases the pair and tries to weaponise the Bible once more, but Ben finally tells her to go away. Laura is run over by Mr. Fincham, whose mental state has steadily declined. When Ben visits her at hospital, she tells him her near-death experience has made her a prophet, and that God says she must divorce Robert and run off with Peter, whom the Bishop has fired; Peter takes Laura to Cornwall to convalescence.\nBen storms off, and runs into Sarah, who prattles in a condescending tone that the affair was God's will. Finally speaking his mind, Ben tells Sarah to \"fuck off\". On Evie's advice, Ben buys a tent and moves into the backyard. Robert tries to speaks to him, but Ben shouts that Robert, not Laura, should have asked for divorce. His father reveals that he did, explaining that he loved his wife and had tried to be faithful even when she was not. Finally free from Laura's brand of Christian fanaticism, Ben and his father reconnect.\n\nBen visits Evie to tell her he is moving to Edinburgh to attend university and study English. Evie is pleased, though saddened Ben will no longer be working for her. He reads her a last poem expressing his gratitude for her friendship, for which Evie compliments him. Ben promises to visit her whenever he is home from college.\n\nThe film closes as Ben, finally free, walks through the park on his way home to start packing for Edinburgh.\n\n\nThis is the fourth time that Julie Walters and Rupert Grint have worked together on a film; the first three times were in the \"Harry Potter\" film franchise where Grint played Ron Weasley and Walters his mother Molly.\n\nIn \"Driving Lessons: Behind the Scenes\", a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, screenwriter/director Jeremy Brock reveals he was still making changes to his script during the rehearsal period, some five years after he completed his first draft. Although the film is not intended to be autobiographical, he was inspired to write it by his teen experience working one summer for Peggy Ashcroft.\n\nIt took six weeks to film the movie in the summer of 2005 and according to director Jeremy Brock the budget of the film was so small that it would not be enough for the catering in Harry Potter.\n\nThe film was shot on location in the Tottenham, Hampstead and Parliament Hill areas of London, at locations including the Parliament Hill Lido and the nearby Holly Lodge Estate. Other locations included Edinburgh and Burnham Beeches in Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe soundtrack includes songs performed by Salsa Celtica, Sufjan Stevens, Nick Drake, Richard Thompson, Ben Folds, and Ginny Clee.\n\nThe distributors were Tartan Films for the UK, Sony Pictures Classics for USA, Gateno Films in Peru, Cathay-Keris Films in Singapore, and Sunfilm Entertainment in Germany.\n\nThe film premiered at the Dublin Film Festival and was shown at the Tribeca Film Festival, the Cannes Film Market, the Moscow Film Festival, and the Edinburgh Film Festival before going into limited release in the UK on 6 September 2006.\n\nThe other film festivals that the film premiered in were Festival of Rio, Dinard Festival of British Cinema, Rome Film Fest, Austin Film Festival, Festival Internacional de Cinema de Brasília, Gijón International Film Festival, 18th International Film Festival Emden-Norderney, Jerusalem Film Festival, Galway Film Festival, Seaward 15th Chichester Film Festival, and Film by the Sea Film Festival.\n\nThe film debut on 8 September 2006 in the United States in cities Los Angeles and New York. It later moved on to other big cities in the United States throughout the rest of the year. The film also premiered in Italy and Thailand in December 2006. In 2007 the film was released in other countries such as Canada, Portugal, Brazil, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore.\n\nThe film was released on 3 July 2007 on DVD in the United States.\n\nThe film holds a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.2, based on 75 reviews. The critical consensus states that \"Though it has charm, \"Driving Lessons\" is a middling offering in the genre where the youngster coming of age meets a quirky senior who teaches valuable lessons about life.\" \n\nStephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" said the film \"belongs to that hardy niche of British comedies designed as star vehicles for distinguished actresses (preferably Dames) of a certain age whose assignment is to win awards by devouring the scenery.\" He added, \"The screwball ageing diva genre isn't the only formula guiding this stubbornly old-fashioned movie. \"Driving Lessons\" belongs to the silly feel-good mode of \"The Full Monty\", \"Calendar Girls\", \"Billy Elliot\", \"Kinky Boots\" and dozens of other celebrations of Britons defying convention to become 'free,' whatever that means. Since any connections between \"Driving Lessons\" and the real world are tangential at best, it's a \"faux\" liberation: the easiest kind.\"\n\nRuthe Stein of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" observed, \"With the aid of a charmingly offbeat story and a jolly good dialect coach, the stars leave you thinking, well done. Their spirited performances help cover up glaring holes in the plot. Whenever \"Driving Lessons\" threatens to get off course, Walters . . . steers it in her direction. She doesn't so much steal the movie as borrow it for extended periods and return it with the motor purring.\"\n\nGene Seymour of \"Newsday\" said, \"Everybody in \"Driving Lessons\" is working very hard to show how affecting and touching their movie can be. Indeed, the collective effort invested in this ragged mongrel of a coming-of-age story may con even the most jaded moviegoer into thinking there's something profound being put forth. Forewarned, you may find it sweet enough to fill an empty afternoon . . . \"Driving Lessons\" follows the well-worn path laid down by other, better movies while making strained, ludicrous things happen toward the end.\"\n\nRonnie Scheib of \"Variety\" said, \"The forceful [performances] of the two main divas manage to more or less blast away the moral bulwarks of this otherwise conventional coming-of-age story. The fanatic gleam in Linney's eyes as she oh-so-sweetly lays down the law is matched only by the spectacle of her shuddering attempts to control her fury when thwarted. Walters chews up scenery in grand manner, nicely teetering between drunken helplessness and zesty hedonism. Grint, maintaining puppy-dog altruism, holds his own in the matriarchal maelstrom, redheadedly adorable to the end.\"\n\nPeter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" rated the film three out of five stars and commented, \"The movie looks like a lot of other things: \"Driving Miss Daisy\", \"Harold and Maude\", \"Billy Elliot\", \"Acorn Antiques\". It doesn't quite develop its own identity. And it's somehow inevitable that Dame Evie's hilarious swearing and opinionating fade away as sentimentality takes over. But it's a great turn from Julie Walters, and a likable film.\"\n\nThe film earned $239,962 in the US and $990,633 in other markets for a total worldwide box office of $1,230,595.\n\nAt the 28th Moscow International Film Festival, Julie Walters won the Silver St. George for Best Actress and Jeremy Brock was awarded the Special Jury Prize. Walters was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy but lost to Meryl Streep in \"The Devil Wears Prada\".\n\n"}

The show currently reruns on Pogo in India, Boing in Nigeria, South Africa and France, Boomerang in Thailand and Tooncast in Latin America.\n\nOn April 11, 2017, it was added to Boomerang's streaming app in the United States, making it one of the few shows that are on the app that did not air on the actual Boomerang channel in the US. While it was only broadcast in full screen 4:3, \"Juniper Lee\" was the very first Cartoon Network original series to be produced in a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9.\n\nThe series centers on the life of a preteen girl named Juniper Lee, who lives in Orchid Bay City. Based on Winick's adopted hometown of San Francisco, California, the city is a hub for magical activity and is filled with various monsters and demons, both good and evil. The magic and human worlds have been separated by an invisible mystical shield, known as \"the Veil,\" which prevents ordinary humans from seeing any magic-related events or the creatures related to them. Juniper has recently been made the new Te Xuan Ze, the protector of the balance between the human and magical worlds. \n\nTo accomplish her task, she has been magically enhanced, making her far much stronger and faster than ordinary humans; superhuman strength, superhuman speed, superhuman reflexes and superhuman agility. She can also use various kinds of spells to assist her. Maintaining the balance often interferes with her personal life, including her schoolwork and her social life, but she always manages to keep everything flowing.\n\nWinick has stated that Juniper Lee was inspired by both \"The Simpsons\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\".

He was most famous for his time in the WCHL where he was named a First-Team All-Star by the league in each of its five seasons of existence. He won the league championship and appeared in the 1923 Stanley Cup Final with the Eskimos. Keats was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.\n\nKeats was born in Montreal, Quebec and at a young age moved with his family to North Bay, Ontario where he was given his nickname of \"Duke\" at the age of six. He joined the Cobalt Mining League at the age of 14, and three years later was being paid $75 a week to star in the league. He joined the NHA's Toronto Blueshirts in 1915 and finished fifth in league scoring that year. After playing part of a second season with Toronto in 1916–17, he enlisted in the Canadian military and as a member of the 228th Battalion, spent the following three years fighting in World War I.\n\nKeats settled in Edmonton, Alberta after the war and joined the Edmonton Eskimos of the Big-4 League in 1919, leading the league in scoring in both 1919–20 and 1920–21. Officially an amateur league, there were rumours that Keats and several other players were secretly being paid a professional salary to play in the Big-4. The team officially turned professional when it helped form the WCHL in 1921 with Keats as the league's greatest star. He played for the Eskimos in all five seasons of the league's existence and was named a First-Team All-Star at centre in each. One of the most gifted offensive players of his time, legend has it that he once collected a puck in his own zone and scored a goal after skating the length of the ice surface backwards. Keats led the Eskimos in scoring in 1921–22, recording 31 goals and 24 assists in 25 games, to lead the Eskimos to the top record in the league and the WCHL final where they lost to the Regina Capitals. The Eskimos again finished with the league's top record in 1922–23, and again faced the Regina Capitals in the final. The Eskimos avenged the previous season as Keats scored the championship winning goal in overtime of the second game. Keats and the Eskimos went on to lose the 1923 Stanley Cup Final to the Ottawa Senators.\n\nFacing financial ruin, the Eskimos sold the rights to Keats and six other players to the Boston Bruins for $50,000 in 1926. He played half of the 1926–27 NHL season in Boston before he was traded to the Detroit Cougars, along with Archie Briden, in exchange for Frank Fredrickson and Harry Meeking. Keats began the following season in Detroit but was suspended early in the season after swinging his stick at a spectator in Chicago who was heckling him. He missed three weeks of play as a result. The day after his reinstatement, the Cougars sent him to the Chicago Black Hawks for Gord Fraser and $5,000 cash.\n\nAfter three games with Chicago in 1928–29, he left the team and helped organize the Tulsa Oilers of the American Hockey Association (AHA), and was the league's top scorer that season. He played parts of two more seasons in Tulsa before taking a season off in 1931–32. Keats returned to Edmonton in 1932 as a player, coach and owner of a reformed Eskimos team. He played two seasons before retiring as a player. Keats went on to coach several teams in the Canadian prairies and briefly worked for the Black Hawks before settling in Victoria, British Columbia in 1947 where he worked for the government and served as president of the Victoria Commercial Hockey League.\n\nKeats was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958, and into the Edmonton Sports Hall of Fame in 1964.\n"}

Its name comes from the Tehuelche word , which means \"transparent\". The Argentine Chubut Province, through which the river flows, is named after it. Welsh settlers called the river \"\", meaning \"twisting river\".\n\nThe river is generally shallow and its water flow can vary from between drought and flood. Average discharge is about .\n\nFlooding made the lands beside the river fertile and important for agriculture. The river has great importance for the agricultural and general economy of the province. There were several attempts to create dams near the two townships of Rawson and Gaiman. The Chubut River has a very rare characteristic being higher than the land around it which is mostly arid. Wheat farming was the chief crop and mainstay of the agricultural and commercial resource of Patagonia. At this time the settlers were struggling with finance as they were using sterling, which was in very short supply. \n\nWheat and barley became a more readily available material to trade with. The control of water for irrigation became even more important to newly arriving settlers who were allocated parcels of land or \"chacras\" issued by the Argentine government in the lower part of the valley. In 1882, following a very bad harvest in 1881, a scheme of irrigation ditches from a new canal would ensure consistent watering of crops and deal with the vagaries of the flow of the Chubut. This was key to the survival of the whole Chubut valley. \n\nThe construction of the canal and irrigation system was overseen by a young Welshman, E. J. Williams. His meticulous planning created a detailed system of ditches and channels according to an agreed size and fee structure with the settlers. These landowners dug the channels themselves with simple tools.\n\nThe river is also a popular trout fishing destination.\n\nThe river flows eastwards for approximately , from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean, emptying at Engaño Bay near Rawson. The main arm of the Chubut originates in Carreras, Río Negro Province, and its basin covers a large area of the western Andean foothills between Bariloche and Esquel. It is also fed by the Chico River. The many branches join some distance before the small town of Piedra Parada, where the terrain becomes the flat plain characteristic of Argentinian Patagonia. It flows east and passes by the town of Paso del Sapo, where it turns southeast through relatively unpopulated central Chubut. It meets Highway 25 and turns east once again.\n\nA long concrete dam blocks the river some west of Trelew. This dam, named after paleontologist Florentino Ameghino, was designed in 1943 by engineer Antonio Domingo Pronsato; work started on 19 April 1963. The artificial lake covers . The plant, which uses a high waterfall with a flow of and three turbines, provides energy to Pico Truncado, Caleta Olivia, Comodoro Rivadavia, and the lower Chubut Valley.\n\nIn the 19th century, Welsh settlers arrived in Chubut and established the colony (Spanish:) in the valley of the Chubut river. Today, the Welsh language and Welsh tea houses are common in several towns, many of which have Welsh names. Dolavon and Trelew are examples of Welsh towns.\n"}

In Anglophonic countries outside the whiting's natural range, the name has been applied to various other species of fish.\n\n\"Merlangius merlangus\" has three dorsal fins with a total of 30 to 40 soft rays and two anal fins with 30 to 35 soft rays. The body is long and the head small and a chin barbel, if present, is very small. This fish can reach a maximum length of about . The colour may be yellowish-brown, greenish or dark blue, the flanks yellowish grey or white and the belly silvery. There is a distinctive black blotch near the base of each pectoral fin.\n\nWhiting are native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Their range extends from the southeastern Barents Sea and Iceland to Scandinavia, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, Portugal, the Black Sea, the Aegean Sea, the Adriatic Sea and parts of the Mediterranean Sea. They occur on sand, mud and gravel seabeds at depths down to about .\n\nIn 2014, their conservation status was classified at vulnerable in the Baltic Sea.\n\nUntil the late 20th century, whiting was a cheap fish, regarded as food for the poor or for pets. Whiting was also allegedly used as a filler in flour, beit wheat, barley or rye. In times of shortages, particularly in the eighteenth century, millers and bakers were commonly accused of using ground whiting to cut their flour as the costs of the fish was lower than that of the actual grain. The general decline in fish stocks means it is now more highly valued. The other fish that have been given the name whiting are mostly also edible fish. Several species of the drum, or croaker, family (Sciaenidae) are also called whiting, among them the northern kingfish (\"Menticirrhus saxatilis\"). Whiting was used as a fringe plot point and mise-en-scène in the acclaimed crime drama television series The Wire.\n\nWhiting and related cod species are plagued by parasites. These include the cod worm (\"Lernaeocera branchialis\"), a copepod crustacean that clings to the gills or the fish and metamorphoses into a plump, sinusoidal, wormlike body, with a coiled mass of egg strings at the rear.\n\n"}

Both its sources arise in the Taurus Mountains—the northern in the Geyik Mountains and the southern in the Haydar Mountains. Their confluence is south of Mut.\n\nThe river is 260 km long and empties into the Mediterranean Sea 16 km southeast of Silifke (in Mersin province). The delta of the Göksu, including Akgöl Lake and Paradeniz Lagoon, is one of the most important breeding areas in the Near East; over 300 bird species have been observed. Among others, flamingos, herons, bee-eaters, kingfishers, gulls, nightingales and warblers breed here. The endangered Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta) lays eggs here.\n\nDue to demand for summer vacation apartments by the locals, and since necessary precautions are not taken and public attention is minimal in this part of Turkey, the ecosystem around Akgöl Lake and Paradeniz Lagoon is in heavy danger.\n\nIn 1190, while on the Third Crusade, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa drowned in the river, then known by its Latin name \"Saleph\" and located within the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The crusaders had reached Asia Minor in March, where the emperor continued his campaign to the Holy Land. Having plundered the city of Konya and defeated the forces of the Sultanate of Rum at the Battle of Iconium, his forces arrived on the banks of the river on June 10.\n\nSeveral contradictory statements reflect the circumstances of his sudden death, which have not been conclusively established. According to some sources, the emperor was lost in the current when he tried to cross the water near Silifke; other chronicles report he wished to cool down from the heat of the day and suffered a heart attack while taking a bath. The mortal remains were preserved according to the \"Mos Teutonicus\" process and transferred to Tarsus, Antioch and Tyre by his followers.\n\nOnce without a leader, his crusader's army dispersed; the remnants later joined the Siege of Acre. A monument in Barbarossa's honor was erected on the road from Silifke to Mut.\n\n"}

In his will, the British Jewish philanthropist, Sir Ellis Kadoorie donated 1000,000 British pounds to be invested in the development of Palestine. Herbert Samuel established a committee to determine how to use the money. Two agricultural schools named after Kadoorie were built with these funds, one for Arabs and one for Jews. The Khodori Institute in Tulkarm was founded in 1930, and the Kadoorie agricultural school, near Kfar Tavor, was founded in 1933. The Kadoorie agricultural school was reputed to be one of the best schools in Israel during the British Mandate period.\nThe main educational goal was to prepare students for advanced studies in Europe. The first principal was Shelomo Tzemach, who led the \"honour code examinations\" (exams without the attendance of teachers) and concentrated in the subjects of agriculture and security. The second principal was Nathan Fiat, who served as principal from 1937 to 1959 - the legendary principal that became a model to his student.\n\nThe school's nickname during that period was \"the monastery\", due to the place being so secluded and attendance restricted to boys. During the period of the Israeli War of Independence many of the school's students and graduates fought in the Palmach brigades and were an honorable part of its chain of the command. Many of the graduates of Kadoorie school took active part in agricultural settlement throughout the country.\n\nIn 1975, the school became a regional school, although the boarding school is still active. Today over 1,500 students are enrolled in the school: 200 students from all over Israel in the boarding school, and the rest students of the Lower Galilee area. In addition, the school operates a training farm and a technological college.\n\n\n"}

Clinically, precancerous conditions encompass a variety of conditions or lesions with an increased risk of developing into cancer. Some of the most common precancerous conditions include certain colon polyps, which can progress into colon cancer, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which can progress into multiple myeloma or myelodysplastic syndrome. and cervical dysplasia, which can progress into cervical cancer. Pathologically, precancerous lesions can range from benign neoplasias, which are tumors which do not invade neighboring normal tissues or spread to distant organs, to dysplasia, which involves collections of abnormal cells which in some cases have an increased risk of progressing to anaplasia and invasive cancer. Sometimes the term \"precancer\" is also used for carcinoma in situ, which is a noninvasive cancer that has not progressed to an aggressive, invasive stage. As with other precancerous conditions, not all carcinoma in situ will progress to invasive disease.\n\nThe term precancerous or premalignant condition may refer to certain conditions, such as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, or to certain lesions, such as colorectal adenoma (colon polyps), which have the potential to progress into cancer (see: Malignant transformation). Premalignant lesions are morphologically atypical tissue which appear abnormal when viewed under the microscope, and which are more likely to progress to cancer than normal tissue. Precancerous conditions and lesions affect a variety of organ systems, including the skin, oral cavity, stomach, colon, and hematological system. Some authorities also refer to hereditary genetic conditions which predispose to developing cancer, such as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, as a precancerous condition, as individuals with these conditions have a much higher risk of developing cancer in certain organs.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of precancerous conditions differ based on the organ affected. In many cases, individuals with precancerous conditions do not experience any symptoms. Precancerous conditions of the skin or oral cavity often appear as visible lesions without associated pain or discomfort, while precancerous conditions of the hematological system are typically asymptomatic, or in the case of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, may rarely cause numbness and tingling in the hands and feet or difficulty with balance (see: peripheral neuropathy).\n\nIn many cases, risk factors for precancerous conditions and lesions are the same risk factors that predispose individuals to a specific cancer. For example, individuals with cervical or anal infection with oncogenic, or cancer causing, strains of human papilloma virus (HPV) are at elevated risk for cervical and anal cancers, respectively, as well as for cervical and anal dysplasia. Similarly, sun exposure is an important risk factor for both actinic keratosis as well as skin cancer. However, in many cases, precancerous conditions or lesions can be sporadic and idiopathic in nature, meaning that they are not associated with a hereditary genetic predisposition to the particular cancer, nor with a direct causative agent or other identifiable cause.\n\nThe pathophysiology of precancerous lesions is thought to be similar to that of cancer, and varies depending on the disease site and type of lesion. It is thought that cancer is preceded by a clinically silent premalignant phase during which oncogenic genetic and epigenetic alterations accumulate. The duration of this premalignant phase can vary from cancer to cancer and from individual to individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The town lies about 187 km south of Lima in the Lunahuaná valley at the bank of Cañete River. Due to the unique landscape, Lunahuaná is a very popular destination for both Peruvians and foreign tourists. According to the 2017 census, there were 4,393 inhabitants.\n\nIn Lunahuaná you can taste local dishes prepared in clay pots and wooden stoves such as: Shrimp (various styles), chola soup, duck with rice, tamales, chicharrones, adobo pork, carapulcra, pachamanca, guinea pigs and rabbits.\n\nThe history of Lunahuaná dates back to the origins of Peru. There is evidence that the first settlers arrived in this area between 6000 and 2000 BC. However, it was during the expansion of the Inca Empire that Lunahuaná became the second largest city led by Pachacútec.\n\nThe name Lunahuaná might be derived from Quechua (\"runa\" man, mankind, \"wasi\" punishment). The Lunahuaná valley was the target of Inca conquests. First, the Guarco, or Huarco, settled in the valley. Due to the natural obstacles of the wild Cañete River the campaigns of the Inca took three to four years. Still today there are the ruins of the fortress Inka Wasi eight kilometers from the successful conquest. Tupac Yupanqui was part of these campaigns. Lunahuaná was officially founded in 1821 as a market town of Don José de San Martín.\n\nIn the center of the village there is a Catholic church, situated at the main square, which was built by the Order of the Franciscans in 1690. In 1972 the church was declared a historical monument.\n\nThe main attraction of Lunahuaná is the Cañete river. It is a popular destination for whitewater boat tours (rafting). Other popular activities include hiking, mountain biking, paragliding and fishing.\nInka Wasi is situated about eight kilometers from Lunahuaná. The complex is divided into three sections, the area of the Inca (\"El barrio incaico\"), a religious center called Qullqa ) and finally there is the palace of the Inca ().\n\nIn 2015, an official pisco trail started in Lunahuaná which is the first of its kind in the Lima Region. This trail adds to the other four official pisco trails located in Ica, Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna. \nThe trail includes five wineries approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism (Mincetur).\nThe pisco trail first stops at the winery D’La Cruz (kilometer 33, Annex Jerome). This winery was first founded in 2002 by Johan De La Cruz Peña, its annual production is 13,000 liters of pisco.\nThe next stop is Langla, located at kilometer 35.5, at the winery El Sol owned by Marco Martínez. It was founded in the early twentieth century and its annual production is 8,000 liters of pisco.\nThe trail continues to Condoray, located at kilometer 39.5, where Jose Antonio Espinoza Peña continues the family tradition, started by his grandfather Benedicto Peña, in the winery Santa María, which dates back to 1929. This winery reaches a production of 50,000 liters per year.\nWinery de la Motta is next in the trail tour, located at kilometer 40.5. It was created in 2005 by Sergio De La Mota. Its production volume is around 20,000 liters.\n\nThe last stop in this pisco trail is the winery Viña Los Reyes at kilometer 41. It is the oldest winery in Lunahuaná since 1896 and is administered by Isabel Gonzales del Valle, widow of Domingo Alvarado Reyes. It produced 15,000 liters in 2014.\nAll the wineries of this district, Cañete, have tasting rooms, the latest technologies, areas of accommodation and restaurants.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1992770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992770", "title": "Jerry Weintraub", "text": "Jerry Weintraub\n\nJerome Charles Weintraub (September 26, 1937 – July 6, 2015) was an American film producer, talent manager and actor whose television films won him three Emmys.\n\nHe began his career as a talent agent, having managed relatively unknown singer John Denver in 1970, developing Denver's success through concerts, television specials and film roles, including \"Oh, God!\" (1977). Weintraub has been credited with making \"show business history\" by being the first to organize and manage large arena concert tours for singers. Among the other performers whose tours he managed were Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, The Four Seasons, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, Three Dog Night and The Carpenters.\n\nFollowing his years as a concert promoter, he began producing films. Among them were director Robert Altman's \"Nashville\" (1975), Barry Levinson's \"Diner\" (1982), the original version of \"The Karate Kid\" (1984) and its 2010 remake, as well as the remake \"Ocean's Eleven\" (2001), and its two sequels. Later, Weintraub was executive producer of HBO's series \"The Brink\" and HBO's \"Behind the Candelabra\" in 2013, which won an Emmy. In 2014, he won another Emmy as co-producer of \"Years of Living Dangerously\", a television documentary about global warming. In 2011, HBO broadcast a television documentary about Weintraub's life, called \"His Way.\"\n\nWeintraub was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, and raised in the Bronx, the son of Rose (née Bass) and Samuel Weintraub. His father was a gem dealer. While growing up, he worked as a theater usher and as a waiter in the Catskills.\n\nAfter several years at MCA, where he first started work as a mailroom clerk, he left and formed his own personal management company. While at MCA, he was assistant to Lew Wasserman, whom he thought of as a father figure. In the 1960s, he co-founded the vocal group The Doodletown Pipers. Among the acts that Weintraub managed at this time were Paul Anka, Shelley Berman, Pat Boone, Joey Bishop, The Four Seasons, Jackson Browne, Jimmy Buffett and singer Jane Morgan, whom he would later marry.\n\nWeintraub was the manager of singer and actor John Denver whom he signed in 1970. Weintraub first saw Denver performing at a small club in Greenwich Village and liked his easy, \"mountaineer's\" manner. Weintraub produced a dozen television music specials starring Denver, winning an Emmy for one of them. Later, he produced the film \"Oh, God!\" (1977), starring George Burns and Denver. After Denver became a major success as a singer, he bought Weintraub a Rolls-Royce as a thank-you gift. Weintraub said, \"I couldn't help thinking that it wasn't too long ago that neither of us had bus fare.\" Denver and Weintraub's professional relationship ended acrimoniously, however.\n\nIn 1970 Weintraub convinced Elvis Presley and his manager, Col. Tom Parker, to do his first national tour, something they had not considered, as Elvis was by then a successful film star. The tour, with a modern sound system created for it, helped develop Weintraub's career as a concert promoter.\n\nHe next promoted a tour for Frank Sinatra in 1974, whom Weintraub first put in Madison Square Garden's boxing arena. For the previous six years, Sinatra had basically retired due to the failure of his last album. Weintraub convinced him to do a tour, which led to Sinatra's \"transformation from saloon singer to stadium singer,\" writes biographer Will Friedwald. \"When Frank came out of retirement and started doing stadiums, he didn't know if he would draw,\" recalled guitarist Al Viola. \"Weintraub deserves most of the credit (after Sinatra, that is) for pulling this off,\" says Friedwald.\n\nBob Dylan signed with Weintraub in 1978 after watching a Neil Diamond concert in Las Vegas, knowing that Weintraub managed the impressive event. He began a world tour beginning in Japan which continued through Europe and the U.S., in total performing 114 shows in front of two million people.\n\nBiographer David Morrell writes, \"We take this for granted now, but Weintraub's ability to organize these massive concerts made show-business history.\" Led Zeppelin manager, Peter Grant, recalls that Weintraub worked hard at putting on these large shows. \"It was an event,\" Grant says. And \"Jerry Weintraub loved it.\" Weintraub acknowledged his motivations: \"When I believe in something, it's going to get done,\" he wrote in his autobiography.\n\nWeintraub also managed or promoted concerts for such musical acts as Cuba Gooding, Sr., the Main Ingredient, The Carpenters, The Moody Blues, and The Beach Boys.\n\nWeintraub's first film as a producer was Robert Altman's \"Nashville\" (1975). Until then, United Artists producer David Picker had dismissed the script and would not make the film. A short time later, Weintraub was hosting a party for John Denver in New York, and among the guests he invited was Altman, whom he admired but had never met. \"Altman pulled Weintraub aside,\" recalls the film's screenwriter, Joan Tewkesbury, \"and over a shared joint\" Altman told Weintraub about the script. After another meeting with Altman, Weintraub was hooked on the story. However, no studio wanted to work with Altman, telling Weintraub that the director was a \"pain in the ass\". Weintraub eventually managed to find investors and gave Altman the $2 million he needed to make the film. Following \"Nashville\" , Weintraub's credits as producer over the next few years included \"Oh, God!\" (1977), \"September 30, 1955\" (1978), \"Cruising\" (1980), \"All Night Long\" (1981), and \"Diner\" (1982).\n\nThe success of \"The Karate Kid\" (1984), led Kirk Kerkorian, then owner of MGM/UA, to appoint Weintraub as chairman and CEO of the neglected United Artists division, with Weintraub acquiring a minority stake, but clashes between the two men led to Weintraub's departure after five months. \"The Karate Kid\" had several sequels, all produced by Weintraub, \"The Karate Kid Part II\" (1986), \"The Karate Kid Part III\" (1989) and \"The Next Karate Kid\" (1994).\n\nWeintraub formed Weintraub Entertainment Group (WEG) in February 1987 with $461 million in financing from Columbia Pictures, Cineplex Odeon and others. WEG also signed a 20-year distribution deal with Columbia, and planned to release seven or more movies per year. In 1990 WEG filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Weintraub would then produce for Warner Bros. WEG also subsequently settled a suit brought against it by Columbia.\n\nWeintraub's later films as producer were \"Happy New Year\" (1987), \"Pure Country\" (1992), \"The Specialist\" (1994), \"Vegas Vacation\" (1997), \"The Newton Boys\" (1998), \"The Avengers\" (1998), \"Soldier\" (1998), \"Nancy Drew\" (2007), \"The Karate Kid\" (2010), and the 2001 remake of \"Ocean's Eleven\", for which he founded the company JW Productions. In addition to producing the sequels \"Ocean's Twelve\" (2004) and \"Ocean's Thirteen\" (2007), he appeared in all the \"Ocean's\" films. Weintraub had a small role in \"Vegas Vacation\" (1997) as \"Gilly from Philly\" a high roller casino gambler with two pals, and in \"The Firm\" (1993). He revived the acting career of Ellen Barkin who underwent a massive makeover for her role as Al Pacino's casino assistant.\n\nHe was executive producer of HBO's series, \"The Brink\", and HBO's \"Behind the Candelabra\" in 2013, an Emmy-winning drama about the last ten years in the life of pianist, Liberace. In 2014 he also won an Emmy as co-producer of \"Years of Living Dangerously\", a television documentary about global warming.\n\nA television documentary film about Weintraub's life, called \"His Way,\" directed by Douglas McGrath, was broadcast on HBO in 2011. On a 2010 television appearance of \"The View\", Weintraub made a handshake deal with Whoopi Goldberg to play the next God in a future \"Oh, God!\" sequel, should a favorable script become available. Weintraub had agreed to produce a new adaptation of \"The Legend of Tarzan\" for Warner Bros. which was released on July 1, 2016.\n\nWeintraub was a major contributor to many charities, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Music Center, the UCLA School of Dentistry and the Children's Museum of Los Angeles. In 1988, the American Friends of the Hebrew University gave Weintraub and his wife, Jane, the Scopus Award in gratitude for their support. He was also a major supporter of Chabad and was close with the Lubavitcher Rebbe.\n\nHe also began doing charitable work to help stop the ongoing genocide taking place in Darfur in 2007. Weintraub, Matt Damon, George Clooney, Don Cheadle, and Brad Pitt cofounded the nonprofit organization, Not On Our Watch, dedicated to preventing mass killings in Darfur and other areas of the world. They also raised $9.3 million to aid their relief efforts.\n\nWeintraub was married twice. His first wife was Janice Greenberg, a dentist's daughter from his Bronx neighborhood who had been singer Julius La Rosa's secretary. They had a son Michael. Weintraub's second wife was singer and actress Jane Morgan. Their relationship went from professional to personal and the two were married in 1965 when she was almost 41 and he was 28. Because of her age, she was not able to have children and they ended up adopting three daughters. The couple separated in the 1980s, but never divorced. For 20 years until his death, Weintraub had been living with his girlfriend and longtime companion, Susan Ekins.\n\nWeintraub supported both political parties at various times in his life. However, it is widely noted that he was friends with both George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. He also had a strong spiritual side, which he once described to television host Larry King. He was a devotee of The Lubavitcher Rebbe and believed in his mystical powers.\n\nWeintraub died from cardiac arrest in Santa Barbara, California on July 6, 2015, at the age of 77.\n\nFollowing the announcement of his death, celebrities and friends paid tribute to Weintraub. \"Jerry was an American original, who earned his success by the sheer force of his instinct, drive, and larger-than-life personality,\" said former president George H.W. Bush, a longtime friend. \"He had a passion for life, and throughout the ups and downs of his prolific career it was clear just how much he loved show business.\"\n\n\"He was a force of nature,\" said actor and director Carl Reiner. Actor Don Cheadle wrote, \"Jerry was to me equal parts Godfather, rainmaker, caretaker, PT Barnum and friend.\" George Clooney, star of the \"Ocean's\" movies, said that \"in the coming days there will be tributes about our friend Jerry Weintraub. We'll laugh at his great stories, and applaud his accomplishments. And in the years to come the stories and accomplishments will get better with age, just as Jerry would have wanted it. But not today. Today our friend died.\"\n\nHe is interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\n\"All films, he was producer unless otherwise noted.\"\n\n\n\nIn 1986, the National Association of Theater Owners named Weintraub the Producer of the Year. In 1991, he was named to the board of the Kennedy Center. Weintraub was one of the first independent film producers to be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2007, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.\n\n"}

It had attempted to debut in 1993, but did not pass through the qualifying round. In the first three finals that Slovakia participated in, it placed no better than 18th, which it achieved in 1996. Because of its poor results, it was forced to miss a year after each contest and then the country opted not to return for a number of years. It did eventually return to the Contest eleven years later, in 2009, although they withdrew again within 4 years, having failed to qualify to the final every year since their return.\n\nSlovakia had planned on entering the contest at the 1993 contest, but with the introduction of many new countries, a preliminary round was held to trim down the number of new entries. \"Kvalifikacija za Millstreet\" featured seven countries competing for only three places in the final. Slovakia came fourth in the contest, represented by Elán with \"Amnestia na neveru\", and therefore had to wait another year before entering again.\n\nSlovakia's Eurovision entries in the 1990s weren't very successful, finishing 19th (1994), 18th (1996) and 21st (1998). After the 1998 contest, STV decided not to enter again for a number of years.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1998, STV used an internal selection to select the Slovak entry for the contest. In 2009, Slovakia organised a televised national final for the first time. A number of heats preceded a grand final, held on March 8, 2009 and Kamil Mikulčík and Nela Pocisková were chosen with their song \"Leť tmou\". They finished on 18th place out of 19 in semi-final.\n\nSlovakia tried again in 2010 contest with \"Horehronie\" by Kristina with similar result (16th out of 17 places in the Semi Final), despite being a fan and bookmakers favourite.\n\nThough STV originally stated that Slovakia would not take part in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2011, it eventually did appear in Düsseldorf represented by the new national public broadcaster RTVS, which had been created on 1 January 2011. On 18 February 2011, RTVS revealed their choice for Slovakia's Eurovision 2011 entry. The song was \"I'm Still Alive\" and was performed by twin sisters Daniela and Veronika Nízlová better known as the pop duo TWiiNS. They already had some experience at Eurovision before as backing singers and dancers for Tereza Kerndlová, the Czech entry in the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The 2011 entry was the first Slovak entry performed in English. TWiiNS eventually finished 12th in their Semi Final, which meant they did not qualify for the Grand Final, due to the televote that counterbalanced the good jury rehearsal. They provided the best result for their country in many years.\n\nRTVS sent an artist once again to the Contest in 2012, with a song that was selected internally by RTVS. At a press conference on 7 March 2012, the Slovak entry for the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest was announced: Max Jason Mai with a song called \"Don't Close Your Eyes\".\n\nHe performed in the second semi final, that was held on Thursday, May 24, 2012. The song did not qualify in the finals. It was later revealed that the song finished in last place with 22 points.\n\nOn 4 December 2012, RTVS announced its withdrawal from Eurovision Song Contest 2013, and on 9 September 2013 it announced that it wouldn't return at Eurovision Song Contest 2014. It had also been announced that Slovakia would not return at Eurovision Song Contest 2015, citing financial constraints and an incompatibility between the contest and the programming goals of RTVS. However RTVS returned to the Eurovision Young Dancers in 2015, with RTVS explaining that the return of Slovakia to EYD supported domestic production and promoted national culture at a European level. RTVS announced on 28 September 2015 that Slovakia would not participate in the 2016 contest.\n\nRTVS' PR manager, Juraj Kadáš, explained on 12 April 2016 that Slovakia's absence from the contest since 2012 was not due to poor results, but rather the cost associated with participation. Before the cancellation of the 2020 contest, RTVS had confirmed that they would not participate in 2020 due to a lack of interest from the Slovak public.\n\nRadio FM, the fourth channel of the Slovak Radio (now RTVS), has provided talk radio coverage of the contest since 2010 with Daniel Baláž, Pavol Hubinák and invited guests. It will also broadcast the 2019 final.\n\n"}
{"id": "1992785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992785", "title": "Deliberative opinion poll", "text": "Deliberative opinion poll\n\nA deliberative opinion poll, sometimes called a deliberative poll, is a form of opinion poll that incorporates the principles of deliberative democracy. Professor James S. Fishkin of Stanford University first described the concept in 1988.\nThe typical deliberative opinion poll takes a random, representative sample of citizens and engages them in deliberation on current issues or proposed policy changes through small-group discussions and conversations with competing experts to create more informed and reflective public opinion. A typical polling utilizes participants drawn from a random and representative sample to engage in small-group deliberations to create more informed and reflective public opinion. Deliberative polls have been tested around the world, including in the European Union, the United States, China, and Australia.\n\nThe Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford University describes its process as follows:\n\nFishkin argues that during deliberation, discussion among participants should:\n\nLogistically, deliberative opinion polls are very similar to Danish consensus conferences. However, a deliberative poll is larger, from 100 to 200 participants, to increase representativeness. In addition, instead of reaching a consensus, agreement or verdict at the end of deliberation, deliberative polling is interested in measuring opinion change. The goal is to allow the researcher to infer what choices citizens would arrive at if they could undergo an extensive process of deliberation about an issue.\n\nPBS has worked with Fishkin via the \"By the People Program\" on several deliberative opinion polls, including in 2004 when it sponsored several regional deliberative polls around topics related to the 2004 national elections. In June 2011 PBS joined him in hosting What's Next California poll, with the results intend to inform a future California ballot initiative.\n\nInspired by deliberative polling, a group at Carnegie Mellon University created a tool for online deliberation. Their first tool is an Adobe Connect-based discussion tool called PICOLA. The Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford has also conducted online Deliberative Polls such as the 2007 project on dilemmas of citizenship conducted with the PBS Newshour. Recently, PASOK held a deliberative opinion poll to elect the party's candidate for the municipality of Amaroussion.\n\nFishkin and Yale Law Professor Bruce Ackerman have proposed a national holiday called Deliberation Day to allow voters to gather in large and small groups to discuss political issues.\n\nIssues Deliberation Australia/America, a political psychology think-tank, has worked with the Australian government to use deliberative polling for several important local and national issues, including the referendum on becoming a republic in 1999.\n\nDeliberative democracy was also employed in Brazil, in the state of Rio Grande del Sul, where citizens participated collectively for state planning. For two day, 226 Brazilians gathered in Porto Alegre to deliberate career reform in civil service, before actions were passed.\n\nDeliberative polls have been held in China for over five years. The coastal township of Zeguo in Wenling city has a population of 120,000. Fishkin's team selects a sample who is representative of the general population. Deliberative polling takes place over a one- to three-day period, and the local government utilizes the priorities of the group. The experiment worked so well that the topic expanded from evaluating infrastructure projects the first year (prioritizing public works projects) to the entire budget, and the Chinese are considering the process in other municipalities.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, Fishkin managed deliberative opinion polls for eight investor-owned electric utilities in Texas as part of the states integrated resource planning process. The group's recommendations shifted their focus toward energy efficiency and wind power. With good information, there was a large shift in the percentage of customers who agreed that it was worth the higher cost to invest in energy efficiency and renewable resources.\n\nIn a September 2010 Time magazine article, Joe Klein questioned whether regular citizens were capable of making sound decisions on complex and technical issues. Fishkin responded:\n\nParticipants can come to learn and appreciate the circumstances and interests of competing arguments through extended discussions and deliberations. This can be achieved by:\n\nWhile participants become more engaged and knowledgeable, thoughtful conclusions are expected to emerge, leading to a better quality of public opinion. Furthermore, it is also hoped that such poll can help increase deliberation among all members of the public.\n\nDeliberative polling can also solicit input from specialized sub-publics and serve as important input mechanisms upstream in the policy making process.\n\nDeliberative polls may not be suitable for every public concern. For instance, crisis measures that demand instant decisions would not be appropriate.\n\nFurthermore, organizing such a poll costs a substantial sum of money. In particular, televising part of the content through mass media can be very expensive. Therefore, if neither the governing body nor other organizations are willing to fund such a poll, there is no way to get it started.\n\nIt can be expensive to get sufficient numbers of participants to create a good representative sample and improving the odds that members of more marginalized groups will attend. Since it's not a duty like jury duty, studies conducted so far require incentives, with costs that have included paying for the trips, the hotel and the food for each participant, and booking an attractive venue; in any case, hiring the research crew and moderators will incur costs. Additional costs have included paying for participants’ compensation so that the people who are randomly selected can put aside their duties to attend the events (e.g., providing childcare.)\n\nSome critics would say it is hard to ensure that briefing materials provided to participants are balanced and accurate. It is suggested that an advisory committee with a wide range of people are to be constituted; however, it can be challenging to obtain a balanced advisory committee in the first place. In this sense, it gives room for a biased and/or incomplete presentation of information.\n\nDeliberative polling requires those randomly sampled to gather at a single place to discuss the targeted issues. Those events are typically one to three days while online deliberations can take up to four to five weeks. Even though scientific random sampling are used and each person has an equal chance of being selected, not every selected individual will have the time and interest to join those events.\n\nIn real-world settings, attendance is low and highly selective, and there can be self-selection biases. Data supports such concern as only 300 out of 869 respondents took up the invitation to participate in actual deliberative meetings. What is more important is that those who attended and those who did not differed significantly, and some groups in society are found to be significantly more likely to attend public meetings than others. In general, those who participate tend to be those highly motivated and opinionated. In contrast, research papers from Stanford show that in general the samples are representative.\n\nAs both group dynamics and personalities of participants can play an important role in producing different outcomes of discussions, deliberations can inhibit the types of results Fishkin envisions.\n\nAlthough moderators are trained to minimize imbalances in deliberations, in many deliberative forums there is little empirical data on how well they actually facilitate discussions. However, in the deliberative polls, evaluation questions about the moderators are always included and they invariably are evaluated by the participants as being balanced in their facilitation and as not imposing or suggesting their own views.\nCritics might say that careful moderation of discussions might create captive audiences in which participants behave differently from what is likely to occur in real-world settings. However, the point is to create an environment in which people are effectively motivated to consider competing arguments and become informed. Democratic institutions always raise questions of institutional design. This democratic design is intended to produce a representation of informed and thoughtful opinion and that is likely to be different from the inattentive and sound bite driven public opinion found in ordinary life.\n\nDue to the limited number of participants, the general public might not be better informed. Only those drawn in the sample participate. This limitation cannot be solved by televising the events because the public might not even expose themselves to those specific programs. In fact, critics say spillovers from public meetings to broader social discourse are moderate at best.\n\nIn addition, in spite of potentially balanced and structured public meetings, televised coverage critics might say that the discussions produce a situation in which the voices of the most vocal groups were amplified and the perceptions of majority opinions in turn did not reflect real opinion distributions. However, in the Deliberative Poll the opinions before and after deliberation are reported in confidential questions so perceptions of group discussion are not the basis for policy recommendations.\n\nAlthough the researchers claim to be interested in measuring change in public opinion instead of reaching an agreed verdict, such method has been used as inputs into policy-making process. The researchers hold that seeking consensus produces social pressure that distorts the measurement of opinion. Hence confidential questionnaires provide a better basis for measuring considered judgment. Indeed, deliberative polling in Texas has led to the largest-ever investments by Texas in renewable energy, conservation subsidies for low-income consumers, and lower prices for customers buying renewable energy. More recently, Fishkin again claims that deliberation polling should be used in key policy issues like energy. Nonetheless, critics might say that results derived from such public meetings might not reflect lay audiences’ views, and using them \"as gauges of public reactions may produce policy choices that are diametrically opposed to public preferences.\" Defenders of deliberative polling would say that the process measures uninformed and disengaged opinion before deliberation and considered judgments when the public is more informed after deliberation. Public policymakers and the media get both from a deliberative poll and choose which they wish to listen to.\n\n\n\n"}

He was serving at Maafushi Prison for drug offences when he was beaten to death by the NSS personnel of the Security unit during a riot which endangered the lives of the prison security personnel.\n\nEvan attended Majeediyya School for his secondary education. He was jailed several times for drug offences and other related crimes.\n\nOn September 19, 2003, inmates of Evan Naseem's cell crossed the partitions, on two different occasions, to assault a person named Ali Didi who was detained in a different cell. This incident was reported to Maafushi Jail Office by the security unit in writing, along with two separate lists of people who crossed the partitions. Evan's name was not on either of the lists. Later the same day Evan's fellow inmates were throwing objects at other cells. The Officer-in-Charge of the Maafushi Jail Security Unit, Captain Adam Mohamed, exaggerated the matter to police headquarters at Malé. Adam Mohamed was given permission to remove the \"troublemakers\" from the cell (where Evan was) and to keep them handcuffed. \n\nLater the same night a team of five security personnel came to Evan's cell with a list of people who were involved in assaulting Ali Didi and throwing objects at other cells. Though Evan's name was not on the list submitted earlier to Maafushi Jail Office, the new list included his name. As their names were read out, the men came out from the cell. When Evan's name was called out he refused to come out, saying he was not involved in any of the previous unrest or disputes. Upon his refusal one of the security personnel went into the cell and asked him to come out. He still refused to walk out and warned the security person not to come closer or touch him. The security man was attacked twice with a wooden plank as he went towards Evan. Soon after this incident, numerous members of the unit stormed into the cell. Evan then yieldingly walked out of the cell.\n\nAfter being removed from the cell, Evan was taken to a place called \"Range\" where he was kept separate from other inmates. There he was beaten up by 12 Security personnel. He was beaten up with bare hands, wooden planks and riot batons. On various occasions he lost consciousness because of continuous beatings. \nWhen he no longer responded, he was taken to Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in the early morning of September 20, 2003. According to the medical reports he died on September 19, 2003, 2320hrs due to injuries sustained to his lungs.\n\nInmates of Evan Naseem learned of his death the same day. This resulted in a protest which then lead to unrest in Maafushi Prison. To control this unrest NSS personnel at Maafushi shot several unarmed prisoners killing 3 and injuring 17 others.\n\nNews of the death of Evan broke out quickly in the capital city Malé. A large number of people gathered at his burial service. While people were at the cemetery, news of the shooting incident reached the already angry public. Civil unrest in Malé grew with this news. Several police stations were set on fire, government buildings were attacked, and government vehicles were set on fire or destroyed by the angry mob. The government controlled the unrest by around 2300hrs and declared a State of Emergency, for the first time in the country's history, in Malé and nearby islands. A curfew was imposed in Malé.\n\nPresident Maumoon Abdul Gayoom established a Presidential Commission on September 20, 2003 to investigate the death of Evan Naseem and the shooting incident at Maafushi Prison. The findings of the commission were released to the public with the title \"Report on the Death of Hassan Evan Naseem\". However, several sections from the public report were omitted due to national security concerns.\n\n"}

He was the Republican nominee for U.S. Senator from Vermont in 2006, but lost the election to Representative Bernie Sanders. Tarrant and his wife, Deborah, reside in Colchester, Vermont, where he works for his charitable foundation.\n\nTarrant was born in Newark, New Jersey and raised in West Orange, New Jersey.\n\nTarrant initially went to Saint Bonaventure University and was a walk-on with the basketball team. He requested a scholarship but was denied. Tarrant then transferred to Saint Michael's College on a basketball scholarship and was a first-team All-American in his senior year. He led the Purple Knights to the Final Four of the 1965 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament, where they were defeated 93–70 by the University of Evansville, who had Jerry Sloan and Larry Humes, both All-Americans. In the consolation game of the same tournament, Tarrant played against Phil Jackson of North Dakota, who went on to fame as a player, coach, and executive in the National Basketball Association. He was a fourth-round draft pick of the world champion Boston Celtics, but was cut before the first game of the season. Tarrant graduated from Saint Michael's in 1965 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. He then went to work for IBM in Burlington, Vermont, selling computer equipment in the northern part of the state.\n\nIn 1969, Tarrant and his business partners Robert Hoehl and, later, Paul Egerman founded Burlington Data Processing (BDP) with a Small Business Administration loan. The company changed its name to Interpretive Data System (IDS) and later to IDX Systems Corporation. BDP initially provided payroll and claims processing for physicians. By 2005, IDX had contracted with thousands of doctors' offices across the country, and provided computer technology for many of the United Kingdom's medical centers.\nBetween 1995 and 2005, Tarrant was chairman of IDX's board. In 2006, General Electric bought IDX for $1.2 billion. Tarrant now lives in Colchester, Vermont, where he works for his charitable foundation.\n\nTarrant served as a member of the University of Vermont's Board of Trustees for several years and on the Saint Michael's College Board of Trustees. He donated funds to Saint Michael's for a new athletic center that was named in his parents' honor.\n\nTarrant and his wife have created the Richard E. and Deborah L. Tarrant Foundation, which makes grants intended to enrich the quality of life in communities throughout Vermont. Its \"primary areas of focus are basic human services, education and community-based grantmaking.\" In 2005, the Grantsmanship Center listed the foundation as one of the top 40 Vermont foundations in charitable giving. The foundation is prohibited from making any donations to pro-choice groups.\n\nMost recently, Tarrant's foundation invested in the Milton public school system, providing monetary support for a pilot program (\"Home School at School\") that gave students an opportunity to learn at different paces.\n\nIn 2007, Tarrant's foundation gave $1 million toward the creation of a $1.8 million community center in Winooski, Vermont.\n\nOn December 18, 2018, the University of Vermont announced that Tarrant and his family had given $15 million for its new multi-purpose center, which will house the men's basketball team and be called the Tarrant Event Center. It is the second athletic-related facility that bears the Tarrant name in Vermont. In 1994, Tarrant donated $5 million toward the construction of St. Michael's College's student recreation center, which is named in honor of his parents.\n\nIn 2005, Tarrant announced his candidacy for the US Senate seat vacated by the retirement of Independent Senator Jim Jeffords. On September 12, 2006, he won the Republican nomination, defeating US Air Force Lt. Col. Greg Parke and marijuana legalization activist Cris Ericson. Tarrant faced Independent Representative Bernie Sanders in the November general election. Sanders, who won the Democratic nomination but ran as an Independent, defeated Tarrant by 33 percentage points. The race proved to be the most expensive race in Vermont history with both candidates together spending close to $13 million. Tarrant spent roughly $7 million of his own money in the race and Sanders raised roughly $6.5 million and spent most of it. Tarrant's campaign was remarkable for its saturation of radio and television with a serial biography of the candidate and attack ads of Sanders.\n\n"}

In 1997, the NCAA Lacrosse Committee named Gait, along with his twin brother and Syracuse teammate, Paul, to the 25th Anniversary Lacrosse team.\n\nHe played in the NLL for 17 years, winning Rookie of the Year in 1991, earning league MVP honors for five straight years, from 1995 to '99 and winning All-Pro honors each season. Gait led the league in points and goals seven times, won three league championships and finished his indoor career with 1,091 points, a league record at the time.\n\nGait also played five seasons in MLL from 2001 to 2005, winning the league title three times and co-MVP honors in 2005.\n\nHe helped Canada win the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship, the country's first world championship since 1978, by scoring four goals in the final against the United States.\n\nGary Gait and his twin brother Paul played lacrosse for the Syracuse Orange of Syracuse University from 1987 to 1990, where they set numerous records during their time there. Gait was named an All-American by the USILA four times — three times as a First Team selection and once as an Honorable Mention. Gary graduated as Syracuse University's all-time goal leader with 192 career goals. He led the Orange to three NCAA DI Championships and was named the NCAA Player of the Year in 1988 and 1990 and the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA Tournament in 1990. The Gait twins are also widely known for popularizing innovative plays such as behind-the-back passes and shots and the \"Air Gait,\" an acrobatic scoring move where they would jump from behind the goal crease and score a goal in mid-air by dunking the ball over the top goal crossbar and land on the opposite side of the crease. This move was later banned in NCAA play.\n\nGait started playing in the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (later the National Lacrosse League) in 1991. He was drafted by the Detroit Turbos who got both Gait brothers in a slightly controversial double-pick. In this season he won the MILL championship and was given the Rookie of the Year Award. He played with Detroit for one more season before him and his brother were both traded to the Philadelphia Wings in 1993. This trade was highly controversial as the Wings traded all of their draft picks to Detroit for the two players.\n\nGait played five seasons on the Philadelphia Wings. Gait visited the championship his first four years on the Wings and won the title twice (1994 & 1995). He was voted league MVP in 1996 and 1997 and was crowned Championship MVP in 1995. Gait spent more time with the Wings than any other single NLL/MILL team and is where he is most remembered for playing. In 1995 Gary's brother Paul was traded to Rochester, separating the brothers until they played together on the Washington Power in 2001. Gary was traded to Baltimore for the 1998 season so he could play closer to his home.\n\nGait only played two seasons with the Baltimore Thunder. In Gait's first year on the team they went to the Championship which was a new best-of-3 style series. They were defeated two games to zero by his former Philadelphia Wings. Gait was still voted league MVP for the 1998 season for how much he helped Baltimore improve. In 1999, Baltimore went 8-4 in the regular season but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Rochester Knighthwaks. The Baltimore Thunder re-located to become the Pittsburgh CrosseFire in 2000 and so Gary moved with the franchise.\n\nIn Pittsburgh's only season, they went 6-6 and missed the playoffs. This was the first time in Gait's NLL/MILL career that he missed the playoffs, he would only miss 3 times in his entire 18-season career. After a not-so-good first season the CrosseFire re-located to Washington, D.C. where they became the Washington Power.\n\nIn the two seasons the Washington Power existed, they made it to the playoffs. Gary was there for both of these season and so was his brother Paul, re-uniting them for the first time since 1994 when the both played in Philadelphia. In 2001, Washington lost in a semi-final game to Toronto with a final score of 10 to 9. In 2002, Washington beat Philadelphia in the quarter-finals 10–11 before having a rematch with Toronto in the semi-final where the Power was defeated 11–12. The Washington Power faced low attendance and as such re-located to Colorado where they became the Colorado Mammoth. As with the Thunder and CrosseFire, Gait moved along with the franchise as it re-located once again.\n\nGait played with the Colorado Mammoth for three seasons. In his first game of the 2006 season, Gary was honored by the Mammoth. On December 30, 2005, at the Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado, the Colorado Mammoth raised his jersey number (22) to the rafters, making him the second player in NLL history to have his number retired, after Buffalo's Darris Kilgour. They went to the playoffs all three seasons but never advanced to the championship. Gait announced his retirement following the 2005 season. He was then voted into the NLL Hall of Fame along with his brother, Paul. After retiring he became Head coach of the Mammoth for 2006 & 2007, but he stepped down as head coach in August 2007 so he could pursue other interests.\n\nGait returned to the NLL in 2009 when he joined the Rochester Knighthawks. During the 2009 season, Gary was named a reserve to the All-Star game. 2009 would also mark the last time Gary would visit the NLL playoffs as the Knighthawks missed the playoffs in the 2010 and 2011 seasons. Following the 2011 season, Gary announced he was retiring from NLL play for good to pursue a career of lacrosse coaching.\n\nGary Gait had one of the most spectacular NLL careers of any player in league history. He has the second most career goals of any player with 635 and the highest goals per game average in league history with 3.207 goals per game. Gary is also tied with his brother for the most goals in one single game, 10. He had his number retired by Colorado and he is a member of the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame.\n\nGait played in Major League Lacrosse since its inception in 2001. He was a member of the Long Island Lizards. After the first season, Gait was traded to the Baltimore Bayhawks where he served as a player-coach for the next four years. In 2005, Gait won the Steinfeld Cup as a player-coach. He scored six goals in the Championship Game and was named MVP of that game as well as the season.\n\nGait initially retired from MLL play in 2005 but recently returned and signed with the Hamilton Nationals for their inaugural season in 2009.\n\nGait, along with his brother, had outstanding seasons with the Victoria Shamrocks of the Western Lacrosse Association. Gait won the Mike Kelly Memorial Trophy as most valuable player of the Mann Cup as a Shamrock in 1997, and shared the most valuable player award with his brother Paul in 1999.\n\nIn June 2005, Gait was named head coach of his former NLL team, the Colorado Mammoth. After a 10-6 season in which the Mammoth finished second in the Western Division, Gait led them to an overtime 18-17 win over Calgary and a 13-12 win over Arizona before shutting down the East Division champion Buffalo Bandits 16-9 in the Championship game. Gait became the first rookie head coach to win a championship since Tony Resch did it with the Philadelphia Wings in 1994, a team on which Gait played.\n\nIn August 2007, Gait stepped down after two seasons as head coach of the Mammoth and returned to his alma mater Syracuse University, becoming the second head coach in the history of the women's lacrosse program. Prior to this position, Gait had served as an assistant coach for the University of Maryland women's team for nine seasons.\n\nOn February 3, 2011, Gait was announced as a new assistant coach for the Hamilton Nationals of Major League Lacrosse.\n\nGait was a member of the Canadian National Team in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2004, and 2006. In that final year, he led Team Canada to a historic 15-10 victory over the United States in the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship, his last ever international game. Gait scored four goals in the final quarter, marking a fairytale finish to his international playing career as the World title gave him every possible major lacrosse title (three NCAA championships at Syracuse in 1988, 1989, 1990; three NLL titles in 1991, 1994, 1995; three MLL titles in 2001, 2002, 2005; three Mann Cups in 1991, 1997, 1999; the Heritage Cup in 2004; and the International Lacrosse Federation World Championship in 2006).\n\n\nGait also played amateur lacrosse for the storied Mount Washington Lacrosse Club in the 1990s.\n\nReference:\n\nGait set many NLL scoring records during his career.\n\nGait was named NLL MVP six times, including five consecutive seasons. Other than Gary Gait, only John Tavares (3 times) has ever won the award more than once.\n\nHe was also given the NLL Sportsmanship Award twice, in 2004 (tie with Peter Lough) and 2005.\n\nNLL Weekly and Monthly Awards:\n\nGait was named the MLL MVP his final season in 2005, sharing it with Mark Millon. That season he also led the league in goals and points with 42 goals and 21 assists for 63 points.\n\nMLL Weekly Awards:\n\nGary along with his twin brother Paul Gait were inducted into their home province's highest honour in 2011. The BC Sports Hall of Fame will place the legendary brothers into its Hall on September 13, 2011, in a ceremony in Vancouver.\n\nGait lives in Fayetteville, New York with his wife, Nicole, and their children.\n\n"}

It is native to subtropical southeastern China, from Fujian west to southeast Yunnan, and also very locally in northern Vietnam and Laos.\n\nIt is a medium-sized to large tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to , possibly more. The leaves are deciduous, spirally arranged but twisted at the base to lie in two horizontal ranks, long and broad, but long and scale-like on shoots in the upper crown. The cones are green maturing yellow-brown, pear-shaped, long and diameter, broadest near the apex. They open when mature to release the small, long, winged seeds.\n\nIt typically grows in river banks, ponds and swamps, growing in water up to deep. Like the related genus \"Taxodium\", it produces 'cypress knees', or pneumatophores, when growing in water, thought to help transport oxygen to the roots.\n\nThe species is nearly extinct in the wild due to overcutting for its valuable decay-resistant, scented wood, but it is also fairly widely planted along the banks of rice paddies where its roots help to stabilise the banks by reducing soil erosion. There appear to be no remaining wild plants in China and few of those in Vietnam are seed-bearing. A population of Chinese swamp cypress was recently discovered in central Laos. The species is found in several botanical gardens around the world. It was previously reported that there were four specimens of this tree growing in Bank Hall Gardens, Lancashire, United Kingdom, but it has now been confirmed that they are in fact the Swamp or Bald Cypress from south-eastern USA, \"Taxodium distichum\".\n\n"}

Hungary attempted to participate in but failed to qualify from a special qualifying competition set up for seven former eastern bloc countries.\n\nHungary's first contest in 1994 remains its most successful, with Friderika Bayer finishing in fourth place. The country's only other top five result is András Kállay-Saunders' fifth-place in . Their other top ten results are Magdi Rúzsa finishing ninth in , ByeAlex tenth in , and Joci Pápai eighth in , giving Hungary a total of five top ten placements.\n\nThe country's first entry would have been \"Árva reggel\", performed by Andrea Szulák, in , but a qualification round was installed just for former Eastern Bloc countries, and the song did not manage to qualify to the grand final. The first official participation was of \"Kinek mondjam el vétkeimet?\", performed by Frederika Bayer, in . Hungary received the maximum score of 12 points from the first three countries to vote. However, as the competition progressed, it attracted fewer votes, and finished in fourth place.\n\nThe entry was not as successful, garnering only 3 points, narrowly beating last-place Germany. In Hungary again failed to qualify when \"Fortuna\", performed by Gjon Delhusa did not qualify from the pre-qualification round.\n\nHungary withdrew after the contest, returning in , where they finished in 12th place in the final with \"Forogj, világ!\", performed by NOX. However, Hungary withdrew again in , returning in with \"Unsubstantial Blues\", the first Hungarian entry in English, performed by Magdi Rúzsa, the winner of the 3rd season of the Hungarian talent show Megasztár. The song came 9th in Helsinki, receiving 128 points in the final.\n\nAfter coming last in the semi-final in the contest, Magyar Televízió (MTV), the Hungarian broadcaster, confirmed Hungary's participation at the contest in Moscow. After MTV's original choice was revealed to have been released before 1 October 2008, breaking contest rules, it was decided that \"Dance with Me\", performed by Zoltán Ádok, would be Hungary's entry, after MTV's second choice to represent Hungary declined. The song placed 15th in the second semi-final, failing to qualify for the grand final for the second time since the introduction of the semi-finals in .\n\nIn October 2009, MTV confirmed that they would not participate in the contest due to financial limitations in the company which would prevent them from sending an entry to the contest in Bærum, Norway. Duna TV broadcast the event live and applied for EBU membership to send a representative to Düsseldorf in 2011. However, during the EBU's 65th conference, Duna TV's bid to become an active member was rejected. In December 2010, it was confirmed that MTV had agreed to return to the 2011 edition. MTV internally selected the song \"What About My Dreams?\", performed by Kati Wolf. The song placed 7th in the first semi-final with 72 points, and was the first entry representing Hungary to qualify for the final since . In the final, the song placed 22nd with 53 points.\n\nIn , MTV organised a national final, \"A Dal\", to select the Hungarian entry for the contest in Baku. The song \"Sound of Our Hearts\", performed by Compact Disco, was selected. The song placed 10th in the first semi-final with 52 points, and 24th in the final with 19 points. As of 2019, \"A Dal\" has been used as the Hungarian selection process every year since.\n\nIn , Hungary reached the top 10, when the song \"Kedvesem (Zoohacker Remix)\", performed by ByeAlex, placed 10th with 84 points.

MTVA stated that they would \"support the valuable productions created by the talents of Hungarian pop music directly\" instead of participating in the contest.

The film was directed by Don Siegel, based on the short story \"The Road to Carmichael's\" by Richard Wormser.\n\nU.S. Army lieutenant Duke Halliday (Robert Mitchum) is robbed of a $300,000 payroll by Jim Fiske (Patric Knowles). When Halliday's superior, Captain Vincent Blake (William Bendix), suspects him of having taken part in the theft, Halliday has no choice but to pursue Fiske into Mexico. Along the way, he runs into Joan Graham (Jane Greer), who is after the $2000 she loaned to her boyfriend, Fiske. The two join forces, though they are not sure at first if they can trust each other. Fiske stays one step ahead of the couple, while they are in turn chased by Blake. When Halliday is knocked down trying to stop Fiske from getting away, he comes to the attention of Police Inspector General Ortega (Ramon Novarro). Halliday claims to be Blake (using identification he took from the captain after a brawl.) Ortega lets him go after Fiske, but keeps an eye on him. His suspicions are confirmed when the real Blake shows up at his office for help.\n\nHalliday and Graham track Fiske to an isolated house in the desert, where Fiske is meeting with Seton (John Qualen), a fence who offers Fiske $150,000 in untraceable bills in exchange for the payroll. The couple are captured by Seton's henchmen. When Blake shows up, Halliday is initially relieved to be rescued, until he learns that Blake is actually Fiske's partner in crime.\n\nFiske wants to take Graham with him, but Blake makes it clear that he intends to dispose of both her and Halliday. Fiske reluctantly gives in. However, when he starts to leave, Blake shoots him in the back, explaining that his ex-partner, apparently still at large, can take the blame for the missing payroll. Halliday then points out to Seton that if Blake gets rid of him too, he can give the stolen money back to the army \"and\" keep the $150,000 for himself. Taking no chances, Seton pulls a gun on Blake. When Graham creates a distraction, a fight breaks out, which Graham and Halliday win.\n\n\nGeorge Raft originally was meant to play the lead but was replaced by Robert Mitchum in the wake of Mitchum's arrest on September 1, 1948 for possession of marijuana. It's said RKO owner Howard Hughes saw Mitchum's notoriety surrounding the arrest (the actor already seen as a 'bad boy' in Hollywood) as a positive that would boost attention for a rather low-rent - but perhaps profitable - production. It was a proven scheme for Hughes, who, immediately following the arrest, had pushed for another of Mitchum's pictures, \"Rachel and the Stranger\", to be released sooner than was planned in order to capitalize on the headlines. This was done for the film September 18, 1948 and resulted in it becoming one of the biggest hits of the year.\n\nThe movie was filmed in Los Angeles and in Tehuacán, Puebla, Mexico.\n\nChannel 4 film reviews describes the movie as \"Sparkling dialogues, fast-paced chases and the occasional twist make this an at first somewhat confusing but ultimately hugely entertaining film.\"\n\nHal Erickson writing for Allmovie calls the film \"tautly directed by Don Siegel, who manages to pack plenty of twists and turns into the film's crowded 71 minutes.\"\n\n"}

The only way for this to be relieved was for the unfortunate to wear a sack made from linen grown in a field using manure from a farmyard that has not been disturbed for forty years, spun by \"Habetrot\", bleached by an honest bleacher in an honest miller's milldam and sewed by an honest tailor.\n\n\n"}

It was released in March 1984, about a month after the duo (Marc Almond and David Ball) publicly announced they were dissolving the partnership. The album peaked at number 12 in the UK Album Chart, and would be Soft Cell's last album for 18 years.\n\nThe album represents a shift in style from the delicate, erotic, dancefloor-friendly pop of their earlier records and contains a more eclectic mix of styles as well, from the Spanish-influenced \"L'Esqualita\" (inspired by the drag bar in New York City called \"La Escuelita\") to the rockabilly-tinged \"Down in the Subway\". The thematic elements of the songs are also noticeably darker, even for Soft Cell, and center around self-destruction and the breakdown of innocence. \"Meet Murder My Angel\", according to Almond, is about the mind of a murderer before he slaughters his victim, while \"Where Was Your Heart (When You Needed It Most)\" centres on a girl who loses all self-esteem after being raped while intoxicated. The first single from the album was \"Soul Inside\", which reached number 16 on the UK charts in September 1983. \"Down in the Subway\" was released as the second single, peaking at number 24 in March 1984.\n\nThe artwork was originally printed entirely in red and gold ink, down to the liner notes, lyrics, LP labels, and serial number. The album was largely a critical success, but ultimately received little commercial attention, and has since gone out of print. A remastered version with bonus tracks, which included a 12\" single mix of \"Soul Inside\", a cover version of the theme from the James Bond film \"You Only Live Twice\", and \"Her Imagination\", cut during a session at the BBC, was also released, although this too has since gone out of print and copies are quite rare, the full album including extra tracks is however readily available for official download.\n\n\nExtra tracks on remastered CD: Some Bizzare / Mercury (558,267-2, June 1998)\n\n\nwith:\n"}

It is also known as the black chanterelle, black trumpet, trompette de la mort (French), trombetta dei morti (Italian) or trumpet of the dead.\n\nThe Cornucopia, in Greek mythology, referred to the magnificent horn of the nymph Amalthea's goat (or of herself in goat form), that filled itself with whatever meat or drink its owner requested. It has become the symbol of plenty.\n\nA possible origin for the name \"trumpet of the dead\" is that the growing mushrooms were seen as being played as trumpets by dead people under the ground.\n\nThe fruiting body does not have a separation into stalk and cap, but is shaped like a funnel expanded at the top, normally up to about tall and in diameter (but said to grow exceptionally to ). The upper and inner surface is black or dark grey, and the lower and outer fertile surface is a much lighter shade of grey. The fertile surface is more or less smooth but may be somewhat wrinkled.\n\nThe size of the elliptical spores is in the range 10–17 µm × 6–11 µm. The basidia are two-spored.\n\nThis fungus is found in woods in North America, Europe, Japan and Korea. Mainly it grows under beech, oak or other broad-leaved trees, especially in moss in moist spots on heavy calcareous soil. In Europe it is generally common but seems to be rare in some countries such as the Netherlands. It appears from June to November, and in the UK, from August to November.\n\nThe mushroom is usually almost black, and it is hard to find because its dark colour easily blends in with the leaf litter on the forest floor. Hunters of this mushroom say it is like looking for black holes in the ground.\n\n\"Craterellus cornucopioides\" has a smooth spore-bearing surface, but the rare and not very closely related \"Cantharellus cinereus\" has rudimentary gills. The colour and smooth undersurface make \"C. cornucopioides\" very distinctive.\n\nThe forms \"Craterellus fallax\" (with a different spore colour \"en masse\") and \"Craterellus konradii\" (with a yellowish fruiting body) have been defined as separate species, but DNA studies now show that the latter should be considered part of \"C. cornucopioides\" \n\nHorns of plenty are edible and sought after. According to a Portuguese study, 100 grams of dried \"C. cornucopioides\" contain 69.45 g of protein, 13.44 g of carbohydrates (mostly mannitol, a sugar alcohol) and 4.88 g of fat, amounting to 378 calories. They contain fatty acids, primarily of the polyunsaturated variety, as well as phenols, flavonoids and 87 mg of vitamin C.\n\nThey look rather unattractive, but have a very good flavour. When dried their flavour acquires black truffle notes; it this form it can be crumbled as a condiment.\n\nOne French cookbook specializing in mushrooms has eight different recipes for this species, including terrine, soufflé, marinade, tajine, and fricassée.\n\n"}

{"id": "1992983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992983", "title": "Polylogism", "text": "Polylogism\n\nPolylogism is the belief that different groups of people reason in fundamentally different ways (coined from Greek poly=many + logos=logic). The term is attributed to Ludwig von Mises, who claimed that it described Marxism and other social philosophies. In the Misesian sense of the term, a polylogist ascribes different forms of \"logic\" to different groups, which may include groups based on race, gender, class, or time period.\n\nA polylogist would claim that different groups reason in fundamentally different ways: they use different \"logics\" for deductive inference. Normative polylogism is the claim that these different logics are equally valid. Descriptive polylogism is an empirical claim about different groups, but a descriptive polylogism need not claim equal validity for different \"logics\". That is, a descriptive polylogist may insist on a universally valid deductive logic while claiming as an empirical matter that some groups use other (incorrect) reasoning strategies.\n\nAn adherent of polylogism in the Misesian sense would be a normative polylogist. A normative polylogist might approach an argument by demonstrating how it was correct within a particular logical construct, even if it were incorrect within the logic of the analyst. As Mises noted \"this never has been and never can be attempted by anybody.\"\n\nThe term 'proletarian logic' is sometimes taken as evidence of polylogism. This term is usually traced back to Joseph Dietzgen in his 11th letter on logic. Dietzgen is the now obscure philosophical monist of the 19th century who coined the term 'dialectical materialism' and was praised by communist figures such as Karl Marx and V. I. Lenin. His work has received modern attention primarily from the philosopher Bertell Ollman. As a monist, Dietzgen insists on a unified treatment of mind and matter. As Simon Boxley puts it, for Dietzgen \"thought is as material an event as any other\". This means that logic too has \"material\" underpinnings. (But note that Dietzgen's \"materialism\" was explicitly not a physicalism.)\n\nRacialist polylogism is often identified with the Nazi era. It has been proposed that the ferment around Einstein's theory of relativity is an example of racialist polylogism. Some of the criticisms of relativity theory were mixed with racialist resistance that characterized the physics as an embodiment of Jewish ideology. (For example, Nobel Prize winner Philipp Lenard claimed scientific thought was conditioned by \"blood and race\", and he accused Werner Heisenberg of teaching \"Jewish physics\".) However this appears to be an argument ad hominem, not polylogism. Modern examples of supposed racialist polylogism are generally misleading. For example, US Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor has been accused of racialist polylogism for suggesting that a \"wise Latina\" might come to different legal conclusions than a white male. Although generally given the interpretation that life experience can influence one's ability to understand the practical implications of a legal argument, some commentators suggested that Sotomayor supported the idea that Latinas have a unique \"logic\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1992984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992984", "title": "Greensboro sit-ins", "text": "Greensboro sit-ins\n\nThe Greensboro sit-ins were a series of nonviolent protests in February to July 1960, primarily in the Woolworth store, now the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, in Greensboro, North Carolina, which led to the F. W. Woolworth Company department store chain removing its policy of racial segregation in the Southern United States. While not the first sit-in of the Civil Rights Movement, the Greensboro sit-ins were an instrumental action, and also the best-known sit-ins of the Civil Rights Movement. They are considered a catalyst to the subsequent sit-in movement, in which 70,000 people participated. This sit-in was a contributing factor in the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).\n\nIn August 1939, black attorney Samuel Wilbert Tucker organized a sit-in at the then-segregated Alexandria, Virginia, library (now the Alexandria Black History Museum). In 1942, the Congress of Racial Equality sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, as they did in St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. The Dockum Drug Store sit-in in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, was successful in ending segregation at every Dockum Drug Store in Kansas and a sit-in in Oklahoma City the same year led the Katz Drug Stores to end its segregation policy.\n\nThe Greensboro Four (as they would soon be known) were Joseph McNeil, Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair Jr., and David Richmond, all young black students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in their freshman year who often met in their dorm rooms to discuss what they could do to stand against segregation. They were inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr. and his practice of nonviolent protest, and specifically wanted to change the segregational policies of F. W. Woolworth Company in Greensboro, North Carolina. During Christmas vacation of 1959, McNeil attempted to buy a hot dog at the Greensboro Greyhound Lines bus station, but was refused service. Shortly thereafter, the four men decided that it was time to take action against segregation. They came up with a simple plan: they would occupy seats at the local F. W. Woolworth Company store, ask to be served, and when they were inevitably denied service, they would not leave. They would repeat this process every day for as long as it would take. Their goal was to attract widespread media attention to the issue, forcing Woolworth to implement desegregation.\n\nOn February 1, 1960, at 4:30 pm ET, the four sat down at the 66-seat L-shaped stainless steel lunch counter inside the F. W. Woolworth Company store at 132 South Elm Street in Greensboro, North Carolina. The men, Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain and Joseph McNeil, who would become known as the A&T Four or the Greensboro Four, had purchased toothpaste and other products from a desegregated counter at the store with no problems, but were then refused service at the store's lunch counter when they each asked for a cup of coffee. According to a witness, a white waitress told the boys \"We don't serve Negroes here\". Blair responded that he was just served 2 feet away, to which the waitress replied \"Negroes eat at the other end\". An African-American girl who was cleaning behind the counter called them \"stupid, ignorant, rabble-rousers, troublemakers\". Another African-American told them, \"You're just hurting race relations by sitting there\". However, an elderly white women told them, \"I am just so proud of you. My only regret is that you didn't do this ten or fifteen years ago\". Store manager Clarence Harris asked them to leave, and, when they would not budge, called his supervisor, who told him, \"They'll soon give up, leave and be forgotten\". Harris allowed the students to stay and did not call police to evict them. The four freshmen stayed until the store closed that night, and then went back to the North Carolina A&T University campus, where they recruited more students to join them the next morning.\n\nThe next day, on February 2, 1960, more than twenty black students (including four women), recruited from other campus groups, joined the sit-in. This group sat with school work to stay busy from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The group was again refused service, and were harassed by the white customers at the Woolworth store. However, the sit-ins made local news on the second day, with reporters, a TV cameraman and police officers present throughout the day. Back on campus that night, the Student Executive Committee for Justice was organized, and the committee sent a letter asking the president of F.W. Woolworth to \"take a firm stand to eliminate discrimination.\" Upon hearing of the sit-ins, the president of the college, Warmoth T. Gibbs, remarked that Woolwoorth's \"did not have the reputation for fine food\". The students wrote the following letter to the president of Woolworth's:\n\nDear Mr. President:\nWe the undersigned are students at the Negro college in the city of Greensboro. Time and time again we have gone into Woolworth stores in Greensboro. We have bought thousands of items at the hundreds of counters in your stores. Our money was accepted without rancor or discrimination, and with politeness towards us, when at a long counter just three feet away our money is not acceptable because of the colour of our skins...\nWe are asking your company to take a firm stand to eliminate discrimination. We firmly believe that God will give you courage and guidance in solving the problem.\nSincerely Yours, Student Executive Committee\nOn February 3, 1960, the number grew to over 60, including students from Dudley High School. An estimated one third of the protesters were women, many of them students from Bennett College, a historically black women's college in Greensboro. White customers heckled the black students, who read books and studied, while the lunch counter staff continued to refuse service. North Carolina's official chaplain of the Ku Klux Klan (Kludd), George Dorsett, as well as other members of the Klan, were present. The F.W. Woolworth national headquarters said that the company would \"abide by local custom\" and maintain its segregation policy.\n\nOn February 4, 1960, more than 300 people took part. The group now included students from North Carolina A&T University, Bennett College, and Dudley High School, and they filled the entire seating area at the lunch counter. Three white female students from the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina (now University of North Carolina at Greensboro), Genie Seaman, Marilyn Lott, and Ann Dearsley, also joined the protest. Organizers agreed to expand the sit-in protests to include the lunch counter at Greensboro's S. H. Kress & Co. store that day. Students, college administrators, and representatives from F.W. Woolworth and Kress met to discuss, but with the stores' refusal to integrate, the meeting was not resolved.\n\nOn February 5, 1960, a high tension environment at the Woolworth counter emerged when 50 white men sat at the counter, in opposition to the protesters, which now included white college students. Again, more than 300 were at the store by 3:00 pm, at which time the police removed two young white customers for swearing and yelling, and then police arrested three white patrons before the store closed at 5:30 pm. Another meeting between students, college officials, and store representatives took place, and again there was no resolution. The store representatives were frustrated that only certain segregated stores were being protested, and asked for intervention by the college administrators, while some administrators suggested a temporary closure of the counters.\n\nOn Saturday, February 6, 1960, over 1,400 North Carolina A&T students met in the Richard B. Harrison Auditorium on campus. They voted to continue the protests and went to the Woolworth store, filling up the store. More than 1,000 protesters and counter-protesters packed themselves into the store by noon. Around 1 pm, a bomb threat set for 1:30 pm was delivered by call to the store, causing the protesters to head to the Kress store, which immediately closed, along with the Woolworth store.\n\nOn March 16, 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower expressed his concern for those who were fighting for their human and civil rights, saying that he was \"deeply sympathetic with the efforts of any group to enjoy the rights of equality that they are guaranteed by the Constitution.\"\n\nThe sit-in movement then spread to other Southern cities, including Winston-Salem, Durham, Raleigh, Charlotte, Richmond, Virginia, and Lexington, Kentucky. In Nashville, Tennessee, students of the Nashville Student Movement were trained by civil rights activist James Lawson and had already started the sit-in process when Greensboro occurred. The Nashville sit-ins attained desegregation of the downtown department store lunch counters in May 1960. Most of these protests were peaceful, but there were instances of violence. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, tensions rose between blacks and whites and fights broke out. In Jackson, Mississippi, students from Tougaloo College staged a sit-in on May 28, 1963, recounted in the autobiography of Anne Moody, a participant. In \"Coming of Age in Mississippi\", Moody describes their treatment from whites who were at the counter when they sat down, the formation of the mob in the store and how they managed finally to leave. The sit-ins spread to other forms of public accommodation, including transport facilities, swimming pools, lunch counters, libraries, art galleries, parks and beaches and museums, primarily in the South.\n\nAs the sit-ins continued, tensions started growing in Greensboro. Students began a far-reaching boycott of stores with segregated lunch counters. Sales at the boycotted stores dropped by a third, leading their owners to abandon segregation policies. On Monday, July 25, 1960, after nearly $200,000 in losses ($ million in dollars), and a reduction in salary for not meeting sales goals, store manager Clarence Harris asked four black employees, Geneva Tisdale, Susie Morrison, Anetha Jones, and Charles Bess, to change out of their work clothes and order a meal at the counter. They were, quietly, the first to be served at a Woolworth lunch counter. Most stores were soon desegregated, though in Jackson, Tennessee, Woolworth's continued to be segregated until around 1965, despite multiple protests.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 mandated desegregation in public accommodations.\n\nThe International Civil Rights Center & Museum in Greensboro contains the lunch counter, except for several seats which the museum donated to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016 and a four-seat portion of the lunch counter acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1993, displayed in the National Museum of American History.\n\nIn 1990, the street south of the site was renamed February One Place, in commemoration of the date of the first Greensboro sit-in.\n\nIn 2002, the \"February One\" monument and sculpture, depicting the Greensboro Four was erected on North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University's campus.\n\nOn February 1, 2020, Google showed a Google Doodle of a diorama made by Karen Collins to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Greensboro sit-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He attended the \"Gymnasium\" in Cottbus and from 1924 worked for four years on seagoing vessels. He later began an theatrical education in Cottbus and Berlin. During an engagement in Stuttgart, he met the Jewish actress Meta Wolff (1902–1941). They married on 3 May 1930 in Halberstadt, shortly before Hitler came to power. They had a son, Michael, who was born in February 1933.\n\nAfter the Nazi \"Machtergreifung\" in 1933, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels promoted the establishment of the \"Reichskulturkammer\" institution. Actors were required to apply for membership in the \"Theaterkammer\" on presentation of an \"Aryan certificate\" which meant a prohibition (\"Berufsverbot\") to Gottschalk's wife. The couple managed to avoid the anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws and rising tide of anti-semitic violence in Nazi Germany. From 1934 Gottschalk performed at the Schauspielhaus Frankfurt and in 1938 joined the Volksbühne ensemble in Berlin. In the same year he began his film career starring in the romance \"You and I\" directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner, side by side with the popular German actress Brigitte Horney.\n\nWhile World War II began with the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, Gottschalk and Horney appeared as a \"dream couple\" in a string of successful movies. Gottschalk took his Jewish wife to a social function and introduced her to some of the prominent Nazis who were present. Although the Nazis were charmed, Goebbels (a virulent anti-Semite) learned about this incident, and decreed that Gottschalk would be required to separate from his Jewish wife. When Gottschalk refused, Goebbels ordered Gottschalk's wife and child transported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. The minister's Special Representative Hans Hinkel insisted on the divorce and Gottschalk was threatened to play no further roles. Gottschalk insisted on accompanying Meta and Michael to Theresienstadt, but Goebbels ordered Gottschalk inducted into the German Army, the Wehrmacht.\n\nOn 6 November 1941, minutes before the expected arrival of the \"Gestapo\" at their house in Berlin-Grunewald, Gottschalk and his wife committed suicide by gas poisoning after sedating their son, who died with them. They are buried at the Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery. Though warned by Minister Goebbels, Brigitte Horney and Wolfgang Liebeneiner, as well as other artists like Gustav Knuth, Hans Brausewetter, Werner Hinz, and Ruth Hellberg attended the funeral.\n\nGoebbels ordered no further mentions of Gottschalk in the German newspapers, but word got out anyway and millions of German women mourned his death. Because of Nazi censorship, most of his devoted fans did not learn the awful circumstances of his death until after the war. In 1947 Kurt Maetzig directed the DEFA melodrama \"Marriage in the Shadows\" after a novella by Hans Schweikart evoking the couple's fate. The 2002 drama \"Times Like These\" written by John O'Keefe is based on their individual tragedy.\n\n\n\n"}

Funding was obtained from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\n\nOn 13 September 2006, the RepRap 0.2 prototype printed the first part identical to its own, which was then substituted for the original part created by a commercial 3D printer. On 9 February 2008, RepRap 1.0 \"Darwin\" made at least one instance of over half its rapid-prototyped parts. On 14 April 2008, RepRap made an end-user item: a clamp to hold an iPod to the dashboard of a Ford Fiesta car. By September that year, at least 100 copies had been produced in various countries.\n\nIn April 2009, electronic circuit boards were produced automatically with a RepRap, using an automated control system and a swappable head system capable of printing both plastic and conductive solder. On 2 October 2009, the second generation design, called Mendel, printed its first part. Mendel's shape resembles a triangular prism rather than a cube. Mendel was completed in October 2009. On 27 January 2010, the Foresight Institute announced the \"Kartik M. Gada Humanitarian Innovation Prize\" for the design and construction of an improved RepRap.\n\nOn 31 August 2010, the third generation design was named Huxley. It was a miniature of Mendel, with 30% of the original print volume. Within two years, RepRap and RepStrap building and use were widespread in the technology, gadget and engineering communities. \n\nIn 2012, the first successful Delta design, Rostock, had a radically different design. The latest iterations used OpenBeams, wires (typically Dyneema or Spectra fishing lines) instead of belts, and so forth, which also represented some of the latest trends in RepRaps.\n\nIn early January 2016, RepRapPro (short for \"RepRap Professional\", and one commercial arm of the RepRap project in the UK) announced that it would cease trading on 15 January 2016. The reason given was congestion of the market for low-cost 3D printers and the inability to expand in that market. RepRapPro China continues to operate.\n\nAs the project was designed by Dr Bowyer to encourage evolution, many variations have been created. As an open source project, designers are free to make modifications and substitutions, but they must share their improvements.\n\nThere are many RepRap printer designs including:\n\nRepRap was conceived as a complete replication system rather than simply a piece of hardware. To this end the system includes computer-aided design (CAD) in the form of a 3D modeling system and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software and drivers that convert RepRap users' designs into a set of instructions to the RepRap to create physical objects.\n\nInitially, two CAM tool chains were developed for RepRap. The first, called \"RepRap Host\", was written in Java by lead RepRap developer Adrian Bowyer. The second, \"Skeinforge\", was written by Enrique Perez. Both are complete systems for translating 3D computer models into G-code, the machine language that commands the printer.\n\nLater, other programs like slic3r, pronterface, Cura, were created. Recently, the Franklin firmware was created to allow RepRap printers to be used for other purposes such as milling and fluid handling.\n\nRepRapFirmware (RRF) is another popular firmware used on Duet boards. Due to the open-source nature of the firmware, people are now working on porting the RepRapFirmware to Marlin boards like the SKR series.\n\nThe closed source KISSlicer and repetier host are also used.\n\nFree and open-source 3-D modeling programs like Blender, OpenSCAD, and FreeCAD are preferred in the RepRap community, but almost any CAD or 3D modeling program can be used with the RepRap, as long as it can produce STL files (slic3r also supports .obj and .amf files). Thus, content creators make use of any tools they are familiar with, whether they are commercial CAD programs, such as SolidWorks and Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk 123D Design, Tinkercad, or SketchUp along with the libre software.\n\nRepRaps print objects from ABS, Polylactic acid (PLA), Nylon (possibly not all extruders can), HDPE, TPE and similar thermoplastics.\n\nPolylactic acid (PLA) has the engineering advantages of high stiffness, minimal warping, and an attractive translucent colour. It is plant-derived and biodegradable.\n\nThe mechanical properties of RepRap-printed PLA and ABS have been tested and are equivalent to the tensile strengths of parts made by proprietary printers.\n\nUnlike in most commercial machines, RepRap users are encouraged to experiment with materials and methods, and to publish their results. Methods for printing novel materials (such as ceramics) have been developed this way. In addition, several RecycleBots have been designed and fabricated to convert waste plastic, such as shampoo containers and milk jugs, into inexpensive RepRap filament. There is some evidence that using this approach of distributed recycling is better for the environment and can be useful for creating \"fair trade filament\".\n\nIn addition, 3D printing products themselves at the point of consumption by the consumer has also been shown to be better for the environment.\n\nThe RepRap project has identified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a potentially suitable support material to complement its printing process, although massive overhangs can be made by extruding thin layers of the primary printing media as support (these are mechanically removed afterwards).\n\nPrinting electronics is a major goal of the RepRap project so that it can print its own circuit boards. Several methods have been proposed:\n\n\nUsing a MIG welder as a print head a RepRap deltabot stage can be used to print metals like steel.\n\nThe RepRap concept can also be applied to a milling machine and to laser welding.\n\nAlthough the aim of the project is for RepRap to be able to autonomously construct many of its own mechanical components soon using fairly low-level resources, several components such as sensors, stepper motors and microcontrollers cannot yet be made using the RepRap's 3D printing technology and so have to be produced independently. The plan is to approach 100% replication over a series of versions. For example, from the onset of the project, the RepRap team has explored a variety of approaches to integrating electrically-conductive media into the product. This would allow inclusion of connective wiring, printed circuit boards, and possibly motors in RepRapped products. Variations in the nature of the extruded, electrically-conductive media could produce electrical components with different functions from pure conductive traces, similar to the 1940s sprayed-circuit process Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME), by John Sargrove. A related approach is printed electronics. Another non-replicable component is the threaded rods for linear motions. A current research area is in using replicated Sarrus linkages to replace them.\n\nThe \"Core team\" of the project has included:\n\n\nThe stated goal of the RepRap project is to produce a pure self-replicating device not for its own sake, but rather to put in the hands of individuals anywhere on the planet, for a minimal outlay of capital, a desktop manufacturing system that would enable the individual to manufacture many of the artifacts used in everyday life. From a theoretical viewpoint, the project aims to prove the hypothesis that \"rapid prototyping and direct writing technologies are sufficiently versatile to allow them to be used to make a von Neumann universal constructor\".\n\nRepRap technology has great potential in educational applications, according to some scholars. RepRaps have already been used for an educational mobile robotics platform. Some authors have claimed that RepRaps offer an unprecedented \"revolution\" in STEM education. The evidence comes from both the low cost of rapid prototyping by students, and the fabrication of low-cost high-quality scientific equipment from open hardware designs forming open-source labs.\n\n"}

Previously he was Assistant Organist and Choirmaster from 1942 to 1964. In 1969, Dirksen was named the cathedral's Precentor, giving him administrative oversight of all worship services until his retirement in 1991.\n\nDirksen composed extensively, mostly choral and organ works, and his music continues to be regularly featured on broadcasts from the Cathedral. His 1974 opus, \"Vineyard Haven\", has been called \"widely acclaimed as one of the finest hymn tunes of our day\", by editors of hymnology.\n\nDirksen was born in Freeport, Illinois, the eldest son of Richard Watson Dirksen and Maude Logemann. In high school, he played the bassoon and was a drum major. Awarded a scholarship, he then studied organ at Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory under Virgil Fox, graduating \"magna cum laude\" in June, 1942.\n\nWhile still studying at Peabody, Dirksen became assistant organist to Paul Callaway at the Washington National Cathedral in February, 1942. Later that year, he began three-and-a-half years of military service during World War II, resuming his post at the cathedral in December, 1945. In 1949, Dirksen was also appointed director of the glee club at the cathedral's affiliated St. Albans School. In 1969, he was the first lay person in the Anglican Communion to be named a Precentor, meaning he had administrative oversight of all worship services.\n\nDuring his long tenure at the cathedral, he produced ceremonial music and pageants for various occasions, such as the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976 and the consecration of the completed cathedral in 1990, attended by U.S. President George H. W. Bush and other dignitaries. Dirksen was succeeded by Douglas Major as Cathedral Organist and Choirmaster in 1988 and retired as Precentor in 1991.\n\nDirksen was also a composer of almost 300 works, mostly for organ and/or choir or theater.

{"id": "1993094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993094", "title": "Precentor", "text": "Precentor\n\nA precentor is a person who helps facilitate worship. The details vary depending on the religion, denomination, and era in question. The Latin derivation is \"præcentor\", from cantor, meaning \"the one who sings before\" (or alternatively, \"first singer\").\n\nThe chief precentor was the highest position in many ancient Mesopotamian cities (see Music of Mesopotamia).\n\nJewish precentors are song or prayer leaders, leading synagogue music. A Jewish precentor is typically called a hazzan or cantor. In the Middle Ages, women precentors leading prayers in the \"weibershul\" (women's gallery) were known as firzogerin, vorsangerin, foreleiner, zugerin, or zugerke.\n\nA precentor is a member of a church who helps facilitate worship. The role of precentor was carried over from the synagogues into the early church.\n\nThe term \"precentor\" described sometimes an ecclesiastical dignitary, sometimes an administrative or ceremonial officer. Anciently, the precentor had various duties such as being the first or leading chanter, who on Sundays and greater feasts intoned certain antiphons, psalms, hymns, responsories etc.; gave the pitch or tone to the bishop and dean at Mass (the succentor performing a similar office to the canons and clerks); recruited and taught the choir, directed its rehearsals and supervised its official functions; interpreted the rubrics and explained the ceremonies, ordered in a general way the Divine Office and sometimes composed desired hymns, sequences, and lessons of saints. He was variously styled \"capiscol\" (from the Latin \"caput scholæ\", head of the choir-school), \"prior scholæ\", \"magister scholæ\", and \"primicerius\" (a word of widely different implications). Victor of St. Hugo tells us that in the care of the primicerius were placed the acolytes, exorcists, lectors, and psalmists (chanters).\n\nIn the Middle Ages the principal dignitaries of cathedral, collegiate chapters, and monastic orders, imitated the example of St. Gregory the Great in acting as directors of chant-schools. The schola was always in attendance when the bishop officiated in his cathedral, and to the precentor was assigned a place near the bishop and high in dignity. His office was obviously one demanding much learning and executive ability, and his dignity corresponded with his duties.\n\nIn the cathedrals of England, France, Spain, and Germany, a precentor sometimes ranked next to the dean, sometimes next to the archdeacon. In some instances a precentor's sphere of activity was much broader, including the duty of installing deans, canons, and other dignitaries; and in some monasteries, the duties of librarian and registrar. But from the fourteenth century the title and dignity were largely handed over to incumbents whose musical knowledge did not fit them for the duties to which the name of precentor owed its origin; the dignities remained, but the duties became obscured. \"In France, some chapters retain traces of the dignity of Precentor, and one may see sometimes an archdeacon, sometimes a titular or honorary canon, carrying the baton cantoral, the insignia of his office\". This \"baton cantoral\" is a silver or white staff. \"In the dioceses of Aix, Carcassonne, Coutances, Dijon, Metz, Orléans, the dignity of Precentor is still the highest in the chapter... Some chapters have sub-chanters, those of Arras being among the honorary resident canons\", where also the quoted statutes of the Bishop of Dijon may serve to illustrate the modern idea of the office of precentor: \"The Précenteur or Grand Chantre is the head of the choir and ... brings the antiphon to the bishop when officiating pontifically. Sacristans, chanters, choir-boys, and employés of the Cathedral are placed under his surveillance. He will also preserve order and silence in the sacristy\").\n\nA precentor is a person, usually ordained, who is in charge of preparing worship services. This position is usually held in a large church. Most cathedrals have a precentor in charge of the organisation of liturgy and worship. The precentor of a cathedral is usually a residentiary canon or prebendary and may be assisted by a succentor (particularly in the daily task of leading choral singing). In some cathedrals (including Canterbury), the precentor is a minor canon and therefore part of the foundation but not part of the chapter.\n\nTraditionally the precentor's stall (seat) in the cathedral is on the opposite side of the quire from that of the dean, leading to the traditional division of the singers into decani (the dean's side) and cantoris (the precentor's side).\n\nIn Presbyterian churches that worship in the historical fashion (i.e., sing a cappella; see Presbyterian worship), a precentor is a person (man or woman, not necessarily clergy) who leads the singing, often by means of conducting techniques, but sometimes just by singing from amongst the congregation.\n\nChurches that use a repeat-after-me manner of singing called lining out (used primarily when sufficient numbers of psalm books are unavailable, or the congregation insufficiently literate, as was the case in the black church in Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\") are usually led by the precentor, much as with other non-instrumental churches.\n\nThe title \"precentor\" is also used at two English public schools, Radley College and Eton College, and a private school in Sri Lanka, S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, to refer to the head of music. These school precentors have no specific religious duties although, as part of their musical function, they may conduct the college chapel choir. At Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, the precentor's main responsibility is as director of the college choir, which provides music for chapel services.\n"}

{"id": "1993160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993160", "title": "Shi Xie", "text": "Shi Xie\n\nShi Xie () (137–226), courtesy name Weiyan, also known by his Vietnamese name Sĩ Nhiếp, was an official who lived during the Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period of China. He served as the Administrator of Jiaozhi Commandery in present-day northern Vietnam. The third-century historical text \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" (\"Sanguozhi\") is a major source of Chinese traditions concerning Shi Xie's life. He promoted Buddhism throughout his life. After his death, the Vietnamese attached many legends to him and honoured him as King Sĩ (Vietnamese: Sĩ Vương) in some temples.\n\nShi Xie was born in Guangxin Commandery (廣信郡), Jiao Province, which is in present-day Cangwu County, Guangxi, but his ancestral home was around present-day Tai'an, Shandong. His ancestors moved to Jiao Province when Wang Mang usurped the throne and established the Xin dynasty (9–23) with himself as its emperor. Shi Xie's father, Shi Ci (士賜), served as the Administrator of Rinan Commandery (日南郡) during the reign of Emperor Huan () of the Eastern Han dynasty. The Shi family was one of the elite families of Han Chinese origin who later emigrated to present-day Vietnam and played a major role in developing Vietnamese civilisation.\n\nIn his youth, Shi Xie studied the \"Zuo Zhuan\" under the tutelage of one Liu Tao (劉陶) from Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡). Later, he was nominated as a \"xiaolian\" (civil service candidate) and served in the Han central government as a Gentleman of Writing (尚書郎) but was later dismissed because of \"official reasons\". After his father's death, he was nominated as a \"maocai\" (茂才) and was appointed as the Prefect of Wu County (巫縣; present-day Wushan County, Chongqing). In 187, the Han central government reassigned him to be the Administrator (太守) of Jiaozhi Commandery (交趾郡) in Jiao Province.\n\nAround the time, Zhu Fu (朱符) had been appointed by the Han government to serve as the Inspector of Jiao Province. However, the locals in Jiao Province rebelled and killed him after he attempted to extract heavier taxes from them. The Han government then sent Zhang Jin (張津) to replace him, but Zhang Jin was later murdered by his subordinate Ou Jing (區景). When Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, heard about this, he appointed Lai Gong (賴恭) as the new Inspector of Jiao Province without authorisation from the Han central government. At the same time, he also sent his subordinate Wu Ju (吳巨) to replace the deceased Shi Huang (史璜) as the Administrator of Cangwu Commandery (蒼梧郡). To counter Liu Biao's attempts to extend his influence into Jiao Province, the Han central government issued an imperial decree appointing Shi Xie as General of the Household Who Pacifies the South (綏南中郎將) and putting him in charge of the seven commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nAfter Shi Xie sent his subordinate Zhang Min (張旻) to thank the Han central government and pay tribute, the Han central government further promoted him to General Who Stabilises Distant Lands (安遠將軍), in addition to enfeoffing him as the Marquis of Longdu Village (龍度亭侯). Around the time, the Han Empire was in a state of chaos, as various warlords fought for power and territories in northern and central China. Jiao Province, being a remote province in southern China, was not caught up in the chaos. Shi Xie was effectively a warlord in control of Jiao Province even though he was still a nominal subject of the Han Empire. Shi Xie's younger brothers also held important positions in Jiao Province: Shi Yi (士壹), Shi Hui (士䵋) and Shi Wu (士武) were respectively the Administrators of Hepu (合浦), Jiuzhen (九真) and Nanhai (南海) commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nIn 210, Wu Ju got into conflict with Lai Gong and forced him out of Jiao Province. Sun Quan, the warlord who controlled the territories in the Jiangdong region bordering Jiao Province, appointed his subordinate Bu Zhi as the Inspector of Jiao Province to replace Lai Gong. Shi Xie led his followers to submit to Bu Zhi's governorship, but Wu Ju refused and secretly plotted to assassinate Bu Zhi. However, Bu Zhi sensed Wu Ju's intentions and managed to outwit and kill him. Sun Quan later appointed Shi Xie as General of the Left (左將軍) to honour him. At the same time, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government, wanted to gain Shi Xie's support as an ally against Sun Quan, so he conferred the nine bestowments and other honours on Shi Xie in the name of Emperor Xian (the figurehead Han emperor under Cao Cao's control).\n\nIn the years after the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty in 220, Sun Quan declared himself king and established the kingdom (later empire) of Eastern Wu. Shi Xie pledged loyalty to Sun Quan and sent one of his sons, Shi Xin (士廞), as a hostage to Sun Quan to ensure his allegiance towards Wu. He also regularly sent tribute to Sun Quan. During the conflict between Wu and its ally-turned-rival state Shu Han, Shi Xie sided with Wu and instigated Yong Kai (雍闓), a local tribal chief in Shu territory, to rebel against Shu rule and defect to Wu. In recognition of Shi Xie's efforts in inducing Yong Kai to defect, Sun Quan appointed Shi Xie as General of the Guards (衛將軍) and awarded him the title \"Marquis of Longbian\" (龍編侯). Shi Xie died of illness in 226 around the age of 89.\n\n\nShi Xie had at least five sons (in decreasing order of seniority): Shi Xin (士廞), Shi Zhi (士祗), Shi Hui (士徽), Shi Gan (士幹) and Shi Song (士頌).\n\nAfter Shi Xie died in 226, his third son Shi Hui succeeded him as the Administrator of Jiaozhi Commandery (交趾郡) under the Eastern Wu regime. Around the time, the Wu emperor Sun Quan wanted to split Jiao Province and create another province, Guang Province (廣州): Jiaozhi, Jiuzhen (九真) and Rinan (日南) commanderies would remain part of Jiao Province; Cangwu (蒼梧), Nanhai (南海), Yulin (鬱林) and Hepu (合浦) commanderies would form the new Guang Province. Sun Quan then appointed Dai Liang (戴良) and Lü Dai as the Inspectors of Jiao and Guang provinces respectively. Chen Shi (陳時), a close aide of Sun Quan, was to replace Shi Hui as the Administrator of Jiaozhi Commandery.\n\nIn 227, when Shi Hui learnt about the new arrangements, he refused to comply and rebelled against Wu rule by sending his troops to block Dai Liang and Chen Shi from entering Jiao Province. At the time, Huan Lin (桓鄰), one of Shi Hui's subordinates, begged his superior to obey the order and surrender his governorship of Jiaozhi Commandery to Chen Shi. However, Shi Hui refused and had Huan Lin flogged to death. Huan Lin's nephew, Huan Fa (桓發), started a mutiny against Shi Hui and engaged him in a battle that lasted a few months. They made peace after that.\n\nIn the meantime, after learning of Shi Hui's rebellion, Sun Quan ordered Lü Dai, the Inspector of Guang Province, to lead troops to recapture Jiaozhi Commandery. Lü Dai, who was close to Shi Hui's cousin Shi Kuang (士匡; a son of Shi Xie's brother Shi Yi 士壹), sent Shi Kuang to persuade Shi Hui to surrender by promising that he would be spared if he did so. Shi Hui and his brothers then opened the gates of Jiaozhi Commandery and surrendered to Lü Dai. The following day, Lü Dai lured the Shi brothers into a trap during a banquet, had them arrested and then read out a list of Shi Hui's crimes. He then executed all of them and sent their heads to Sun Quan, who was in Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) at the time.\n\nShi Xie's brothers, Shi Yi (士壹) and Shi Hui (士䵋), along with their families, were spared from death but reduced to the status of commoners. Some years later, Shi Yi and Shi Hui were executed for committing crimes.\n\nEarlier in the 220s, Shi Xie had sent his eldest son, Shi Xin (士廞), as a hostage to Sun Quan to ensure the Wu emperor of his allegiance towards him. Shi Xin thus avoided ending up like Shi Hui and his other brothers, who were executed by Lü Dai in 227. Like the rest of the Shi family who survived (e.g. his uncles Shi Yi and Shi Hui 士䵋), he was reduced to the status of a commoner after his brothers' deaths. He died of illness some time later and had no son to succeed him.\n\nSome Chinese heroes were deified in Annam after the fall of the Han dynasty in 220. Among them was Shi Xie, who was deified in the sixth century. As one of the officials who ruled northern Annam in the 1st century, he was given the posthumous name \"Thiên Cảm Gia Ứng Linh Vũ Đại Vương\" () by an emperor of Vietnam's Trần dynasty, as recorded in the \"Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư\" (), and \"History of King Si\" ().\n\nShi Xie is still honoured in some Vietnamese temples today as \"King Si\" (). The Vietnamese history \"Việt Điện U Linh Tập\" (; 1400) adds significantly to the traditions of the Chinese records with local Vietnamese traditions.\n\n\n"}

Hawkins Award from the Association of American Publishers, and was a Book of the Year in \"The Times Literary Supplement\".\n\nJamieson has won teaching awards at each of three universities with which she has been affiliated.\n\nIn this book, Jamieson provides her readers with a new way to interpret political campaigns in an attempt to uncover the truth. She analyzes the various advertising techniques used by candidates, attempting to show themselves in a more positive light than their opponents. Jamieson also provides her readers with many advertising strategies. For example, she explains that many advertisements attempt to impersonate the news, hoping to gain legitimacy.\n\nCovering the media campaigns of America's first presidents to Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, Jamieson looks at the importance of political advertising. In her book, she writes that, \"If political advertising did not exist, we would have to invent it.\" She argues that, although campaigns can be somewhat sleazy and vague, political advertising is a necessity in America, because it reminds voters that they really do have a say in their government.\n\nTogether with Joseph N. Cappella, Jamieson looks at voter turnout and what causes certain people to vote. From their findings, Jamieson and Cappella pioneered the idea that the manner in which the media presents politics leads to some people to choose to not vote. They argue that the media should be focusing on substance, but instead displays politics as more of a game. This, in turn, creates the \"spiral of cynicism\" that leads to the decline of interest and participation in elections.\n\nIn these co-written works with Karlyn Kohrs Campbell, Campbell and Jamieson create a monumental framework for analyzing the rhetoric surrounding presidential oratory. They argue that the presidency is defined by what the president says and how they say it. Through the framework that Campbell and Jamieson create, they describe the different situations and actions in which presidents operate, such as inaugural addresses, special inaugural addresses in the ascension of a vice president, national eulogies, pardoning rhetoric, state of the union addresses, veto messages, the signing statement as the de facto item veto, presidential war rhetoric, presidential rhetoric of self-defense, and the rhetoric of impeachment. This work covers all the presidents up to George W. Bush.\n\nCampbell and Jamieson argue that presidential discourse has had multiple demands of audience, occasion, and institution and in the process of either satisfying or failing, political capital and presidential authority is either supplemented from or depleted to the other branches of government. The original work of \"Deeds Done in Words: Presidential Rhetoric and Genre of Governance\" was updated to address new developments such as the ever-evolving rhetorical strategies and technological advancements in media.\n\nIn \"\", Jamieson applies years of research on elections to the problem of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. She concludes that it is highly probable, but not certain, that the Russians turned the election away from Hillary Clinton to Trump.\n\n\n\n"}

(, 20 June 1211 – 2 March 1282), also known as Agnes of Prague, was a medieval Bohemian princess who opted for a life of charity, mortification of the flesh and piety over a life of luxury and comfort. Although she was venerated soon after her death, Agnes was not beatified or canonized for over 700 years.\n\nAgnes was the daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia, making her a descendant of Saint Ludmila and Saint Wenceslaus, patron saints of Bohemia. Agnes' mother was Constance of Hungary, who was the sister of King Andrew II of Hungary, so Agnes was a first cousin to St. Elizabeth of Hungary.\n\nWhen she was three years old, Agnes was entrusted to the care of St. Hedwig of Andechs, the wife of Duke Henry I the Bearded of Silesia. Hedwig placed her to be educated by a community of Cistercian nuns in a monastery which she herself had founded in Trzebnica. Upon her return to Prague, Agnes was entrusted to a priory of Premonstratensian Canonesses to continue her education.\n\nAt the age of eight, Agnes was betrothed to Henry, son of the Emperor Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Henry was ten years old and had just been crowned King of Germany. According to custom, Agnes should have spent her childhood at her future husband's court. Emperor Frederick, King of Sicily, had his court in Palermo, but his son Henry, King of Germany, lived in Germany at the palace of Archbishop Engelbert in Cologne.\n\nAgnes was sent to the court of Duke Leopold VI of Babenberg. Leopold, however, wanted the young Henry to marry his own daughter, Margaret. After being betrothed for six years, Henry and Agnes's betrothal contract was cancelled. Like other noble women of her time, Agnes was a valuable political pawn. In 1226, Agnes's father Ottokar went to war against the Babenbergs as a result of the cancelled betrothal. Ottokar then planned for Agnes to marry Henry III of England, but this was vetoed by the Emperor, who wanted to marry Agnes himself. \n\nAgnes refused to play any more part in a politically arranged marriage. She decided to devote her life to prayer and spiritual works, for which she sought the help of Pope Gregory IX. Emperor Frederick is said to have remarked: \"If she had left me for a mortal man, I would have taken vengeance with the sword, but I cannot take offence because in preference to me she has chosen the King of Heaven.\"\n\nOn land donated by her brother, Wenceslaus I, King of Bohemia, she founded the Hospital of St. Francis (\"circa\" 1232-33) and two friaries for the Franciscan friars, who had just come to Bohemia at her brother's invitation. Through them, Agnes learned of Clare of Assisi and her Order of Poor Ladies, the monastic counterpart of the friars. She began a correspondence with Clare (which lasted for over two decades), which led to Clare's sending five nuns from the monastery in Assisi to Prague to begin a new house of the order. This was the first Poor Clare community north of the Alps.\n\nAgnes built a monastery and friary complex attached to the hospital. It housed the Franciscan friars and the Poor Clare nuns who worked at the hospital. This religious complex was one of the first Gothic buildings in Prague. In 1235, Agnes gave the property of the Teutonic Knights in Bohemia to the hospital. She herself became a member of the Franciscan Poor Clares in 1236. As a nun, she cooked for and mended the clothes of lepers and paupers, even after becoming abbess of the Prague Clares the following year. As can be seen in their correspondence, Clare wrote with deep maternal feelings toward Agnes, though they never met.\n\nA lay group working at the hospital was organized by Agnes in 1238 as a new military order, dedicated primarily to nursing, known as the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star, following the Rule of St. Augustine. That next year, Agnes handed over all authority over the hospital she had founded to these monastic knights. They were recognized as an order by Pope Gregory IX in 1236-37.\n\nAgnes lived out her life in the cloister, leading the monastery as abbess, until her death on 2 March 1282.\n\nThe Monastery of the Holy Savior, renamed the Convent of Saint Agnes, () began to fall into decline after the Hussite Wars of the 15th century. The community was abolished in 1782. Restored in the 1960s, the building is now a branch of the National Gallery in Prague, featuring the medieval Central European and Bohemian collection.\n\nIn 1874, Pope Pius IX beatified Agnes. Pope John Paul II canonized Blessed Agnes on 12 November 1989. While she was known by her contemporaries because of her supposed visions and healing, such as her prophecy that King Wenceslaus would be victorious in his battle against the Austrians, her canonization was based on her practice of the Christian virtues of faith, hope and charity to an extraordinary degree, and the Church's view is confirmed either through a miracle granted by God in answer to the saint's prayers, or as in this case, by the continuing devotion of the Christian faithful to a saint's example across centuries.\n\nThough Agnes died in 1282, she is still venerated by Christians around the world more than 700 years later. She was honored in 2011, the 800th anniversary of her birth, as the Saint of the Overthrow of Communism, with a year dedicated to her by Catholics in the Czech Republic.\n\nOn the occasion of the eight-hundredth anniversary of St. Agnes’ birth, the Prague Archbishopric in cooperation with the National Gallery in Prague organized an exhibition called \"Saint Agnes of Bohemia – Princess and Nun\" at the national cultural heritage site, the Convent of Saint Agnes in Prague (Old Town). The exhibition was held from November 25, 2011 to March 25, 2012. A similar exhibition, also honoring St. Agnes of Bohemia, took place some 80 years ago. The exposition held about 300 exhibits. Contributing partners included are the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star, the National Archives and Charles University.\n\n\n\n"}

It is about 325 kilometers from Panama City, and is the most extensive of all national parks of Panama and is one of the most important world heritage sites in Central America.\n\nThe Darién National Park is a natural bridge spanning North and South America.\n\nIn 1972 an area of became part of the Alto Darién Protection Forest. In 1980 the area was declared a National Park. In 1983 an area of became a UNESCO biosphere reserve. The park covers .\n\nIt is located in southernmost Panama in Darién province and its southern boundary extends along 90% of the Panama Colombian border. It lies between the Serranía del Darién range, which parallels the Caribbean Sea 16 km to the northeast, and the Pacific Ocean coast. It is adjacent to the Los Katios National Park in Colombia.\n\nThe Darien National Park has a myriad of habitats, ranging from rocky coastlines to sandy beaches to mangroves. The park also has expansive swamps and large areas of tropical forests.\n\nIts most common species include macaw, parrot, and tapirs. The harpy eagle also calls this national park home. It is noted for its incredible genetic value. The park is home to regional endemic species and some that are so rare and endangered that they are on the IUCN Red List. These species include the spotted paca, Mantled howler, night monkey, black-headed spider monkey, jaguar, ocelot, Central American agouti, American crocodile and the capybara.\n\nThe park is one of the few examples remaining in the world of a protected area inhabited by humans. To this day two Native tribes dwell in the park.\n\nVisitors usually fly into El Real, the closest town to the park.\n\nDue to its extreme isolation, the Darién National Park is not very accessible. There are, however, two places where the park is often visited. Santa Cruz de Cana (more simply known as Cana) is one of them. Set in the middle of the park near the eastern slope of Cerro Pirre, Cana is one of Panama's most incredible outdoor areas. It has been called one of the world's ten greatest bird watching spots. There are several trails and a ranger station there.\n\nThe second point of access is Pirre Station. This is an ANAM ranger station set on the opposite side of Cerro Pirre. This area has primary forests and an abundance of wildlife, including several types of monkeys, sloths, and many bird species. There are several trails leading away from the ranger station that can be hiked. Travelers can stay in a basic dormitory at the ranger station.\n\nThe park is also notable for the Darien Gap, the only break in the Pan-American Highway on its intercontinental path from Argentina to Alaska.\n"}

Boole was a professor of mathematics at what was then Queen's College, Cork (now University College Cork), in Ireland.\n\nThe historian of logic John Corcoran wrote an accessible introduction to \"Laws of Thought\" and a point by point comparison of \"Prior Analytics\" and \"Laws of Thought\". According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle’s logic. Boole’s goals were “to go under, over, and beyond” Aristotle’s logic by: \n\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what Aristotle said; Boole’s ‘disagreements’, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotle's logic to formulas in the form of equations—by itself a revolutionary idea. Second, in the realm of logic’s problems, Boole’s addition of equation solving to logic—another revolutionary idea—involved Boole’s doctrine that Aristotle’s rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. Third, in the realm of applications, Boole’s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle’s system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”.\n\nBoole's work founded the discipline of algebraic logic. It is often, but mistakenly, credited as being the source of what we know today as Boolean algebra. In fact, however, Boole's algebra differs from modern Boolean algebra: in Boole's algebra A+B cannot be interpreted by set union, due to the permissibility of \"uninterpretable terms\" in Boole's calculus. Therefore, algebras on Boole's account cannot be interpreted by sets under the operations of union, intersection and complement, as is the case with modern Boolean algebra. The task of developing the modern account of Boolean algebra fell to Boole's successors in the tradition of algebraic logic (Jevons 1869, Peirce 1880, Jevons 1890, Schröder 1890, Huntington 1904).\n\nIn Boole's account of his algebra, terms are reasoned about equationally, without a systematic interpretation being assigned to them. In places, Boole talks of terms being interpreted by sets, but he also recognises terms that cannot always be so interpreted, such as the term 2AB, which arises in equational manipulations. Such terms he classes \"uninterpretable terms\"; although elsewhere he has some instances of such terms being interpreted by integers.\n\nThe coherences of the whole enterprise is justified by Boole in what Stanley Burris has later called the \"rule of 0s and 1s\", which justifies the claim that uninterpretable terms cannot be the ultimate result of equational manipulations from meaningful starting formulae (Burris 2000). Boole provided no proof of this rule, but the coherence of his system was proved by Theodore Hailperin, who provided an interpretation based on a fairly simple construction of rings from the integers to provide an interpretation of Boole's theory (Hailperin 1976).\n\n\n"}

The Guyanese–Surinamese border is the Guyanese river bank (the west bank of the river), Suriname regarded the left bank of the Courantyne as a border, but Guyana disputes this and viewed the center of the river as a frontier, based on the Thalweg Doctrine. This conflict, which has been fueled since the colonial era, was solved in 2007 by a verdict by the Hague Arbitration Court, which settles the border between Guyana and Suriname on the left bank of the river, and the river water body belonging to Suriname. The tribunal that defined the maritime boundary between Suriname and Guyana in 2007 confirmed Surinamese sovereignty over the full width of the Courantyne River.

He is the author of \"Islamic Fundamentalism and the Arab Political Culture\". He specializes in the Arab–Israeli conflict; inter-Arab relations and the Palestinian question; international terrorism and fundamental Islam; theoretical issues and political applications in the Middle East; Asad's foreign policy towards Israel and Lebanon; the culture approach to understanding the Middle-East.\n\nBukay is a supporter of the controversial Huntington thesis of the Clash of Civilisations. He argues that there is a wide gap between what he categorises as \"Western political culture\" and \"the Arab-Islamic political culture\". Bukay also holds controversial opinions in his own right. In a speech to a conference in Jerusalem in 2003, he argued that \"the aggressiveness and fanaticism of Islamic fundamentalism is an existentially lethal phenomenon\". He went on to claim that \"Islam and democracy are totally incompatible, and are mutually inconclusive. The same applies to Modernity, which is perceived as a threat to Islamic civilization\", and that \"Leaders and policy-makers in the West refuse to grasp that the Islamic and Palestinian terrorism embodies the SARS decease: Suicide and Ruin Syndrome of democratic society. Until it is understood that this struggle is the war between the Son of Light against the Sons of Darkness, that they represent the invasion of the Huns, in order to destroy modern culture—the world will continue to face an existential more growing threat\".\n\nIn his book \"Arab-Islamic Political Culture\", Bukay writes: \"This is a culture where rumors are an integral part of social activity, and they quickly become absolute truth that cannot be challenged. It has to do with exaggerations, flights of fancy, and especially, in a society that believes in conspiracies, a society wherein every date is important, that remembers everything and forgives nothing. This is a society wherein the lie is an essential component of behavior patterns, and lying is endorsed by religious sages\".\n\nAccording to an article in \"Haaretz\", Bukay also wrote in the same book: \"There is no condemnation, no regret, no problem of conscience among Arabs and Muslims, anywhere, in any social stratum, of any social position\". The article further alleges that he distributed a document to his students stating that \"when an Arab or a Muslim opens his remarks with the expression wallahi, he is apparently intending to lie\".\n\nThe Arab Association for Human Rights alleged that in the 2004–2005 University of Haifa semester Bukay made a number of offensive and anti-Arab remarks in his lectures, including \"we should shoot terrorists in the head in front of their families\" as a deterrent and \"destroy a whole house, with everyone in it,” in order to get rid of one wanted person, that \"the Arabs are just alcohol and sex\", and that \"the Arabs are stupid and have contributed nothing to humanity.\" Bukay wrote a lengthy article rebutting the claims, insisting that the comments attributed to him had been fabricated. The rector of the University conducted his own investigation and concluded that the alleged remarks \"were not made in the way they were quoted and parts of sentences that were uttered in different contexts were yoked together by manipulation.\" The AAHR also took issue with a number of statements he made in an article titled \"The First Cultural Flaw in Thought: The Arab Character\"; the latter were also criticized by the Anti-Defamation League, which stated they \"fall... into the trap of old and hurtful stereotypes, which express prejudices that are liable to be very destructive...\"\n\n\n"}

His father's cousin was the ghost-story writer M. R. James and the family had links to clergy, lawyers, diplomats, soldiers and sailors who had served across the British Empire. \n\nHaving begun his education in private schools in India, Rhodes James returned to England to attend Sedbergh School and then Worcester College at Oxford University. In 1956, he married Angela Robertson. They had four daughters.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1964, Rhodes James worked in the Clerk's Department (the internal civil service) of the House of Commons, first as a Clerk and then, from 1961, as a Senior Clerk. During this time, his first book, a biography of Lord Randolph Churchill, was published in 1959. His next book, \"An Introduction to the House of Commons\" (1961) was awarded the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. Following two more books\"Rosebery\" (1964), a biography of Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery; and \"Gallipoli\" (published 1965), a reappraisal of the ill-fated Gallipoli Campaignhe became a fellow of All Souls College in Oxford. There, having left his Commons post, in 1964, he engaged in researching the papers of J. C. C. Davidson full-time between 1965 and 1968.\n\nIn 1968, he became Director of the Institute for the Study of International Organisation at the University of Sussex, before moving to work as Principal Officer in the Executive Office of the then Secretary General of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim, in 1973. While at Sussex, he wrote a revisionist biography of Winston Churchill's years between 1900 and 1939, arguing that there were substantial reasons why Churchill's judgement was questioned by his contemporaries. He also edited eight volumes of Churchill's speeches (published 1974).\n\nIn 1976, Rhodes James became a Conservative Member of Parliament after winning the by-election for the marginal seat of Cambridge vacated by David Lane. Despite strong challenges from the Social Democratic Party in the subsequent 1983 and 1987 general elections, he held the seat until his retirement at the 1992 general election.\n\nA self-described moderate one-nation Tory, Rhodes James's views found little favour with Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher and he never progressed beyond the post of Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Foreign Office. He came to resent his lack of promotion and, using the subtitle of his Churchill biography, dubbed his political career \"a study in failure\". He was, however, knighted in 1991.\n\nAmong his works written and published while an MP, Rhodes James wrote two more highly praised biographies, both with official and exclusive access to private papers: \"Anthony Eden\" (1986), a sympathetic biography of the former prime minister; and \"Robert Boothby: A Portrait of Churchill's Ally\" (1991), an account of the life of the maverick backbencher. Several of his biographies, and particularly his edition of the diaries of Sir Henry 'Chips' Channon, were later criticised for suppressing their subject's homosexuality or bisexuality.\n\nIn March 2013, documents released from Margaret Thatcher's private archive included a note from the Government's Chief Whip to the Foreign Secretary describing prevailing attitudes among some Tory MPs at the time. It described Rhodes James as \"hopelessly defeatist, depressed and disloyal\".\n\nAfter standing down from Parliament in 1992, Rhodes James lobbied unsuccessfully for a peerage. He later held several visiting professorships at American universities before his death, aged 66, in 1999.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1993383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993383", "title": "WYCD", "text": "WYCD\n\nWYCD (99.5 FM, \"New Country 99-5 YCD\") is a radio station in Detroit, Michigan. WYCD's offices and studios are located at Entercom's Detroit facility on American Drive in Southfield, Michigan. WYCD's transmitter is located in Royal Oak Township in Oakland County off Wyoming Avenue just north of the Detroit city limits. WYCD can be heard as far north as Peck, MI, and throughout southern Sanilac County, and parts of Tuscola County. It can also be heard in Toledo, OH.\n\nWABX was preceded on the 99.5 frequency in southeast Michigan by WCAR-FM in Pontiac, Michigan, the FM side of WCAR (now WDFN), in 1948. In 1956, WCAR moved from Pontiac to Detroit; the FM signal was dropped, leaving 99.5 FM open in Detroit. (In 1964, WCAR would buy WLIN-FM/92.3 and rechristen that station WCAR-FM; it is now known as WMXD.) \n\nThe station began broadcasting on May 4, 1960, as WABX, beginning as a classical music station before adopting the MOR format in 1964. For a short period beginning in August 1967, the station adopted an all-girl jock policy during the day, playing jazz-oriented pop music and humorous bits. The idea came from Mickey Shorr, who was program manager and creative director of Century Broadcasting Corp., the station's then-owner.\n\nDuring the Fall of 1967, WABX began airing a new music show called \"Troubadour\" from seven to eight in the evening, hosted by station manager John Small. The show featured blues, folk, and rock music. During this time, WABX was still airing an MOR format, with an emphasis on up-tempo music from artists like Mel Tormé, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Wilson, and Joe Williams.\n\nThe strong, positive response generated by \"Troubadour\" was enough to convince the station's owners to adopt a full-time progressive rock format. On February 1, 1968, \"play lists\" of acceptable tunes went out: the DJs picked their own music, and Century Broadcasting Corporation bit its tongue. With a freeform progressive rock format, WABX became a springboard for the new music that no other station in the market (least of all CKLW and the other Top 40 stations) would touch.\n\nThe ABX revolution was one of style as well as sound. The station made itself a community catalyst for fun: free concerts and movies, kite-flys, bike-ins, and conferences. Also, the station played a role in giving many artists the recognition that they did not have at the time, including The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Iron Butterfly, and The J. Geils Band. The success of WABX inspired other Detroit stations such as WKNR-FM and 101.1 WXYZ-FM to adopt the progressive-rock approach. \"Air Ace\" Dave Dixon was a musician himself who co-wrote the Peter, Paul and Mary hit \"I Dig Rock and Roll Music.\"\n\nDuring the 1970s, WABX evolved into a more mainstream album oriented rock station, albeit one that took a softer, more laid-back approach than its competitors. The station was branded as \"WABX 99\" during this era with a logo similar to the one used by the current WABX in Evansville, Indiana, featuring yellow lettering on a black background. The station's studio also moved from its original location in the David Stott Building in downtown Detroit to a new facility in suburban Oak Park during this period. By 1982, WABX was third-ranked out of three AOR stations in Detroit (behind WRIF and WLLZ). Century Broadcasting sold the station to Liggett Broadcasting that year. Under new program director Paul Christy, WABX shifted from AOR to \"Hot Rock,\" a Top 40/rock hybrid (known on the air as \"Detroit's New Music\"), playing a wide variety of new wave, pop, rock and urban product with a slick, CHR-style presentation. However, the station's market share continued to decline throughout 1983, and a little over a year after WABX debuted \"Hot Rock,\" Liggett decided to change the station's format and calls.\n\nOn January 9, 1984, WABX's long-term reign as a high-rolling rock station came to an end with the song \"When the Music's Over\" by The Doors, after which the station became \"Class FM\", WCLS, with a soft rock format. However, the adult contemporary field in Detroit was as crowded as the rock format had become, and \"Class FM\" was not successful. At this same time, the station was sold to Metropolis Broadcasting.\n\nThe following year, the station became WDTX, reverting to a rock-based CHR format meant to be a radio version of MTV. Eventually, the format evolved into mainstream CHR. However, its success against CHR rivals WCZY and WHYT was limited.\n\nIn 1988, shortly after Hoker Broadcasting bought the station, WDTX changed its call letters to WDFX, known as \"99.5 The Fox\". Part of the branding for this format included a logo with red lettering and a fox tail coming off the letter X. A cartoon fox was featured on some logos wearing a checkered shirt reclining on \"The Fox\" logo while holding a keytar. Part of the station's formula also involved taking frequent on-air pot shots at competitors Z95.5 (referring to the station's previous identity as \"Cozy FM\" and for featuring too much talk) and Power 96 (referring to it as \"Disco 96\" for its rhythmic lean). The station had a promising start, rocketing from 15th to third place 12+ in the fall 1988 Arbitron ratings report and leaping ahead of WCZY and WHYT to become the number one hit station in the market. The ratings then cooled off when The Fox tweaked its CHR format into \"Rock 40,\" a variation of Top 40 heavy on hair bands and other rock-oriented acts. Afterwards, The Fox tweaked its format back to mainstream CHR, and at the same time, added some hip hop to compete with Power 96 (Z95.5 had left the CHR format by then to flip to an Adult Top 40 direction). Ratings did improve and the station posted frequent Arbitron top 10 showings in the late 1980s and early 1990s - but advertising revenue was poor and, in September 1990, the station went into receivership. In addition, WDFX's ratings were adversely affected (as were WHYT's) by the debut of modern rock station 89X in 1991. In August 1992, Alliance Broadcasting bought the station.\n\nOn December 24, 1992, WDFX started stunting by having a character named \"Cowboy Hugh Chardon\" (played by Dr. Don Carpenter) play \"Friends In Low Places\" by Garth Brooks repeatedly (for his good buddy Bobby Stalls in Birmingham) and try to kill \"The Fox\" using various methods suggested by \"listeners\". This was followed by an automated countdown that started at Midnight on Christmas Day, beginning with 63,752 and ending with number one on December 28, 1992. (This was apparently done so they could rebuild the studios.) Instead of changing formats when the countdown ended, it stunted for another week with a six-hour loop of novelty songs they called \"goofy loops\" played repeatedly. This continued until the early morning of January 4, 1993 (the first Monday after the holiday week), when the station finally finished changing formats and became \"99-5 WOW-FM\" WOWF (the call letters had actually been in place since October 1992), a news/talk station with broadcasters such as Art Vuolo and Ed Tyll coming to the station. However, by popular demand, the \"goofy loops\" track was brought back at weekends for the life of the station.\n\nWOWF promoted its news/talk format as an alternative to WWJ and WJR by touting the station's FM signal as clear and static-free, including using the Steely Dan song \"FM (No Static at All)\" in their promos. Station brass described the format in radio trade papers as \"hip full service,\" combining approaches of CNN and MTV/VH1, and avoided the label \"news/talk\" as it was thought that such a label branded the station as being \"old\" and \"stodgy.\" However, the station could never make any significant inroads, and in less than five months' time, the news/talk format was abandoned for a new one.\n\nA few months later, on May 28, 1993, at 3 p.m., the station abruptly dropped the talk format in favor of \"Young Country\", with the first song being \"Small Town Saturday Night\" by Hal Ketchum, and adopted the current WYCD call letters. Part of the branding for this format included the logo for Young Country with red and blue lettering and blue background and a star in the middle of the word \"Young\". Dr. Don Carpenter was one of the few airstaff (afternoons) that remained from the \"Wow FM\" format. Other personalities included in the original lineup were Jim \"JD\" Daniels and Katie Marroso (mornings), Mark Elliot (middays), Jyl Forsyth (nights) Dave Fuller (overnights) and Eddie Haskell (weekends). WYCD positioned itself as a younger-leaning alternative to crosstown W4 Country, which had been enjoying massive ratings as the only country station in town, and the 99.5 and 106.7 frequencies, former rock and roll rivals during 99.5's days as WABX, now found themselves warring in the country format. The format kept its talk element and combined it with younger sounding country music and created \"Morning Shows\" all day that highlighted listener calls, tons of requests and fun jock talk. It was all a part of owner Alliance's \"Young Country\" concept that it had on the air in Dallas, Seattle, and San Francisco. While not a powerhouse in those days, WYCD was successful in its quest to cut into W4's massive audience share, and WWWW eventually switched to a classic rock format in September 1999.\n\nIn September 1995, Alliance would be bought out by Infinity Broadcasting (Infinity would be renamed CBS Radio in December 2005).\n\nOn February 16, 2001, WYCD dropped the \"Young Country 99.5\" moniker in favor of \"Country 99.5\". In April 2002, the station rebranded itself as \"99.5 WYCD, Detroit's Best Country.\" and by June 2006, the station refined its branding to simply \"99.5 WYCD.\"\n\nWith the country format all to itself in Detroit from 1999 to 2006, WYCD has consistently been a Top 10-rated station. In the spring of 2006, WYCD had its best ratings book to date when it tied for first place 12+ with hip-hop station FM98 WJLB.\n\nThe high ratings at WYCD are probably what led WDTW-FM to switch formats back to country in May 2006. After three years of competing in the format, WDTW dropped country music for Rhythmic AC, due to low ratings, making WYCD once again the only country station in Detroit until WDRQ flipped to the format in December 2013 as \"Nash FM 93.1\".\n\nIn 2007, WYCD was nominated for the top 25 markets Country music Radio & Records magazine station of the year award . Other nominees included WUSN Chicago, KYGO-FM Denver, KEEY-FM Minneapolis, WXTU Philadelphia, and KSON-FM San Diego.\n\nIn early 2017, WYCD was the first station in Michigan to add the \"Country Fried Mix\" with DJ Sinister to its lineup.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, WYCD tweaked their branding after 19 years to simply \"99-5 YCD, Detroit's #1 For Country\". \n\nOn February 18, 2020, to combat against WDRQ's relaunch as \"New Country 93-1,\" WYCD once again tweaked their branding to \"New Country 99-5 YCD.\" \n\nNew Country 99-5 YCD currently ranks at #13 (3.4) in the Detroit market, according to the Holiday 2019 PPM Rating release.\n\nSince 2000, WYCD has been the hosts for one of the largest free country music festivals in the world. The Hoedown takes place one weekend every May in downtown Detroit's Hart Plaza. It is a major showcase of new upcoming artists and some very well recognized ones as well.\n\nThe Hoedown was established back in 1983 by former Detroit country outlet WCXI/WCXI-FM. Its first event featured artists like Hank Williams Jr., Tanya Tucker and Mel Tillis. This event soon would attract people from all across the country. When WCXI was sold by Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasters to Shamrock Broadcasting, Shamrock's Detroit station W4 Country took over the event.\n\nIn May 2000, WYCD took over hosting the Hoedown. The station's first year hosting saw artists like Trace Adkins, Montgomery Gentry and Rascal Flatts. Over the years, the Hoedown has had its share of very well known artists kicking off their careers at the concert. Some of these include Reba McEntire, Luke Bryan, Travis Tritt, Toby Keith, and Lonestar, and in 1989, came an unknown artist by the name of Garth Brooks.\n\nThe audience at the event has always increased every year. In 2010, the Hoedown saw its biggest audience yet with over 1.3 million people showing up over the three-day period. 2010 would also be the last year the Downtown Hoedown was a free festival. In years after, WYCD would charge $25 to $30 for admittance.\n\nIn 2010, at the 28th annual Downtown Hoedown, WYCD welcomed nationally known recording artists Uncle Kracker, Zac Brown Band, Dierks Bentley, Darryl Worley and Justin Moore, among many others.\n\nIn 2012, due to a big audience, the Hoedown was relocated to in front of Comerica Park. In 2015, it was announced that it would be moving to West Riverfront Park and would be cut down to only two days.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that it would move yet again, this time to DTE Energy Music Theater. The event will also be shortened to a 1-day concert on Sunday July 31, 2016. After moving to DTE Energy Music Theater the \"Downtown Hoedown\" name was dropped and changed to \"WYCD Hoedown\" or \"99.5 WYCD Hoedown\".\n\nThe current lineup (as of April 2020) is as follows:\n\n\n\n"}

During a 15-year big league playing career, Girardi won three World Series championships with the Yankees in the 1990s and served as the catcher for both Dwight Gooden's no-hitter and David Cone's perfect game.\n\nAfter his playing career ended, Girardi became the Yankees’ in 2005; then in 2006, he managed the Florida Marlins and was named the National League (NL) Manager of the Year, though he was fired after the season. Girardi managed the Yankees from 2008 to 2017, winning the 2009 World Series over the Phillies. He served as an analyst for MLB Network and Fox Sports.\n\nGirardi, the fourth son of Jerry, a former blue collar worker and United States Air Force veteran, and Angela Girardi, was born in Peoria, Illinois, and grew up in East Peoria, Illinois.\nHe attended East Peoria's Neil Armstrong grade school; and Peoria's Sacred Heart/Father Sweeney, where he was coached in basketball by his father. He then attended Academy of Our Lady/Spalding Institute in Peoria, Illinois, where he played quarterback for the football team and catcher for the baseball team.. He is of Italian descent. \n\nGirardi enrolled at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he attended from 1983 through 1986. He played for the Northwestern Wildcats baseball team, where he was a two-time All Big Ten selection and a three-time Academic All-American. In 1984, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 1986, he earned a bachelor of science degree in industrial engineering. He was the first freshman to be elected president of a fraternity (Alpha Tau Omega) at Northwestern.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs drafted Girardi in the fifth round of the 1986 MLB draft. He spent four seasons in the Cubs minor leagues system before making his major league debut. In 1986, Girardi batted .309 in 68 games with the Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League. In 1989, he also played for the Águilas del Zulia in the Venezuelan Winter League.\n\nGirardi made his Major League debut for the Cubs on April 4, 1989. During his rookie year with the Cubs, Girardi batted .248 with a home run and 14 runs batted in (RBIs) in 59 games played. In 1990, he played in 133 games, batting .270 with a home run and 38 RBIs. In 1991, he played in only 21 games, batting .191 with 6 RBIs. In 1992, he played in 91 games, batting .270 with a home run and 12 RBIs.\n\nThe Cubs left Girardi unprotected in the 1992 MLB expansion draft and the Colorado Rockies chose him. During his first year with the Rockies in 1993, he played in 86 games batting .290 with five triples, three home runs, and 31 RBIs. In 1994, he played in 93 games batting .276 with four triples, four home runs, and 34 RBIs. In 1995, he played in 125 games batting .262 with a career-high 8 home runs and 55 RBIs.\n\nAfter the 1995 season, the New York Yankees acquired Girardi from the Rockies in exchange for pitcher Mike DeJean. Girardi took the place of Mike Stanley.\n\nOn May 14, 1996, Girardi caught Dwight Gooden's no-hitter. Girardi played in 124 games during the 1996 season, batting .294 with two home runs and 45 RBIs. In Game 6 of the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, Girardi hit an RBI triple against Greg Maddux that helped the Yankees win that game and ultimately the World Series. When the Yankees made 25-year-old prospect Jorge Posada the backup catcher, Girardi became his mentor. The two catchers split time for the Yankees through 1999. In 1997, Girardi played in 112 games batting .264 with one home run and 50 RBIs. During the World Series-winning 1998 season, he played in 78 games batting .276 with three home runs and 31 RBIs. On July 18, 1999, Girardi caught David Cone's perfect game. During the World Series-winning 1999 season, Girardi played in 65 games batting .239 with two home runs and 27 RBIs.\n\nIn 2000, Girardi left the Yankees and returned to the Cubs, where he was named to that year's All-Star team, as an injury replacement for Mike Piazza. During the 2000 season, Girardi played in 106 games batting .278 with six home runs and 40 RBIs. In 2001, he played in 78 games batting .253 with three home runs and 25 RBIs.\n\nOn June 22, 2002, Girardi was asked to speak to the hometown crowd after the Cubs' nationally televised matchup with the St. Louis Cardinals was cancelled by Commissioner Bud Selig, after Cardinals pitcher Darryl Kile was found dead earlier that day. Taking to the field microphone behind home plate, an emotional Girardi fought back tears as he said that \"due to a tragedy in the Cardinal family\" there would be no game that day. He never specified what had happened, instead asking fans to be respectful of the matter as they found out about it on their own and to pray. Overall, during 2002, Girardi batted .226 with a home run and 26 RBIs in 90 games played.\n\nIn 2003, Girardi played for the Cardinals. He appeared in just 16 games, accumulating 23 at bats in which he batted .130 with one RBI and a .361 on-base plus slugging percentage. Girardi retired at the end of the season.\n\nAfter a spring training stint with the Yankees in 2004, Girardi retired and became a commentator for the YES Network. He hosted the youth-oriented \"Yankees on Deck\", received good reviews and was offered a larger role on 2005 Yankee broadcasts. But he rejected that offer, as well as an offer by Florida Marlins to become the bench coach with a guarantee to become the team's manager in 2006, although he subsequently got that job. Instead, he became the Yankees' bench coach. He managed a game during a Joe Torre suspension, a loss to the Kansas City Royals. Girardi remained the host of Kids on Deck in 2005, having shot his shows before spring training. During games, YES promoted Kids on Deck by showing Girardi sitting in the dugout during breaks in the game.\n\nGirardi was a broadcaster for the third, fourth, and fifth games of the 2006 World Series for Fox as part of the network's pregame and postgame team, along with host Jeanne Zelasko and regular analyst Kevin Kennedy.\n\nAfter fielding managerial offers for the 2007 season, Girardi instead came to terms with the YES network to return to the broadcast booth for 60-plus games as a Yankees analyst and co-host a new show on the network, \"Behind The Plate\", with John Flaherty, also a former Yankee catcher. Girardi also served as color commentator for the No.2 booth (usually with Thom Brennaman) on \"Major League Baseball on Fox\".\n\nIn 2018, he joined MLB Network as an analyst.\n\nAfter the 2005 regular season, Girardi was named the manager of the Marlins, replacing manager Jack McKeon. His first notable action as manager was to prohibit facial hair, a policy similar to that of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nThe team had a 78–84 record with Girardi as manager, and was in wild-card contention even though the team had the lowest payroll in Major League Baseball. At $15 million, the Marlins' 2006 payroll was lower than the salaries of several MLB players. However, Girardi was nearly fired on August 6th when he got into an argument with Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria during a game. According to witnesses and video footage, the Marlins owner was heckling home plate umpire Larry Vanover. When the umpire warned Girardi about the harassment, Girardi and his bench coach Gary Tuck then turned to Loria and told him to stop. Loria had to be talked out of firing Girardi immediately after the game.\n\nOn October 3, 2006 the Marlins announced that they had fired Girardi, despite him winning 2006 Manager of the Year. Girardi said only that he appreciated the opportunity to manage the club. Girardi was thought to be among the leading candidates to replace New York Yankees manager Joe Torre after they lost in the 2006 American League Division Series, but Torre remained with the team. Girardi was also a candidate for the Cubs' manager position, to succeed Dusty Baker; he interviewed for the job just days after leaving the Marlins. With his playing experience in Chicago, he was considered a front-runner for the position. However, the Cubs chose to go with veteran manager Lou Piniella. Girardi took himself out of the running for the Washington Nationals' managerial job shortly thereafter and returned to the broadcast booth for the YES Network in 2007. He said taking another managerial job would have meant a third move in as many years for his family. Despite Girardi's firing, he was rewarded for his achievements with the Marlins in 2006 with the National League Manager of the Year Award and Sporting News Manager of the Year Award for the National League.\n\nIn June 2007 after the Baltimore Orioles fired manager Sam Perlozzo, Girardi interviewed for and was offered the position with the Orioles but turned it down.\n\nWhen the Yankees' managerial position became vacant after the 2007 season, the Yankees interviewed Girardi, Tony Peña, and Don Mattingly. On October 29, 2007, Girardi was reported to be the Yankees' choice and the next day he signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth about $7.5 million. Girardi chose to wear number 27 to signify his wish to lead the Yankees to their 27th world championship. Girardi is a health enthusiast and banned sweets such as ice cream and soda in the clubhouse.\n\nOn August 2, 2008, Girardi participated in his first Old Timers' Day, the last such game played at the original Yankee Stadium. Girardi participated in the next Old Timer's Day on July 19, 2009, the first in the new Yankee Stadium, as well as every one since then. Girardi's first year as a Yankees manager was unsuccessful as the team was eliminated from postseason contention for the first time since 1993, finishing 2008 with an 89–73 record, 3rd in the AL East.\n\nIn 2009, his second year as manager, the Yankees were a much improved team. He led the Yankees to their 40th AL pennant and their 27th World Series title (defeating the Philadelphia Phillies), his first World Series title as manager and the Yankees' first since 2000.\n\nBefore the 2010 season, Girardi changed his number to 28. Newly acquired center-fielder Curtis Granderson had worn 28, but agreed to change his number to 14.\n\nFollowing the 2010 season, Girardi and the Yankees agreed to a three-year deal to keep him as the Yankees' manager.\n\nThe Yankees' 2011 season was plagued by injuries that caused disabled list stints for several key players. Despite the setbacks, Girardi managed to lead the team to the AL East title. Rob Parker of ESPN commended Girardi's performance and felt his efforts were deserving of American League Manager of the Year, but felt he would not get the award due to the Yankees high payroll and what Parker alleges is an anti-Yankee bias. The Yankees were defeated by the Detroit Tigers 3–2 in the divisional round.\n\nOn June 15, 2012, Girardi won his 500th game as a manager. The Yankees reached the playoffs and defeated the Baltimore Orioles 3–2 in the ALDS, but were swept by the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS on October 18, 2012. Girardi's 2013 season was marred by numerous player injuries and controversies, resulting in the Yankees finishing 85-77 (tied 3rd in AL East) and missing the postseason for the first time since 2008.\n\nOn October 10, 2013 Girardi signed a four-year deal worth $16 million to remain as manager of the New York Yankees.\n\nIn 2014 the Yankees finished 84–78, (2nd place in AL East) and did not qualify for the postseason for the second straight year. In 2015, the Yankees finished 87–75, (2nd place again in AL East), clinching the top wild card spot which marked the team's first playoff appearance since 2012, but they lost to the Houston Astros in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. On May 21, 2016, Girardi managed his 1,500th game.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs again in 2016, the Yankees finished 91–71 in 2017, second place in the AL East, and qualified for the postseason as the first Wild Card team in the AL. In 2017 he was successful on a higher percentage of replay challenges than any other MLB manager with 10 or more challenges, at 75.0%. The Yankees beat the Twins, 8–4, in the wild card game and advanced to the ALDS, where they played the Cleveland Indians. After falling behind 0–2, amidst a controversial decision to not challenge a potential hit-by-pitch, Girardi's Yankees rallied back to win three games in a row and faced the Houston Astros in the ALCS. The series began in Houston, and after again falling behind 0–2, the team won all three games at Yankee Stadium, but the season ended after losing Games 6 and 7 back in Houston. Afterward, Girardi's contract expired and on October 26, the Yankees announced he would not return as manager, being replaced by Aaron Boone.\n\nOn August 7, 2019, he became the United States national baseball team manager at the 2019 WBSC Premier12.\n\nOn October 24, 2019, the Philadelphia Phillies hired Girardi as their manager, replacing Gabe Kapler.\n\nGirardi and his wife Kim Innocenzi-Girardi live in Purchase, New York, and have three children. Girardi is of Italian descent and is a devout Christian.\n\nWhile driving home after winning the 2009 World Series, Girardi stopped to help a car crash victim on a dangerous blind curve of the Cross County Parkway in Eastchester, New York. Police said Girardi put his own life at risk while trying to help the driver who had just crashed into a wall. The driver said she had no idea who Girardi was until the responding officers identified him. The next day, Girardi said, \"I think the most important thing is that, obviously, there's a lot of joy in what we do, but we can't forget to be human beings when we help others out.\"\n\nOn October 6, 2012, during the 2012 ALDS against the Baltimore Orioles, Girardi's father Jerry Girardi died at the age of 81. He had Alzheimer's disease and spent the past several years in an assisted care facility. His mother had died from cancer while Joe was a student athlete at Northwestern University.\n\n"}

The western terminus of SR 60 is at the \"Sunsets at Pier 60\" site in Clearwater Beach. The eastern terminus is in Vero Beach near the Atlantic Coast just past State Road A1A.\n\nSR 60 is primarily a four lane divided highway from its western terminus through the town of Lake Wales to County Road 630 near Indian Lake Estates; from there it is a two-lane road until reaching Florida's Turnpike at Yeehaw Junction. From there until its eastern terminus it is a divided highway.\n\nIn the Tampa Bay area it is the main route from Tampa to the Clearwater area beaches and from Tampa International Airport to northern Pinellas county. It also provides service from Tampa International Airport to the Suncoast Parkway. It is the main non-limited access route from downtown Tampa to Brandon, paralleling the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway.\n\nAs of 2005, SR 60 briefly divides into two, one-way streets in southern downtown Clearwater. This is a result of the recent realignment of the SR 60 corridor in the area, following the completion of the new Memorial Causeway.\n\nFrom west to east:\n\nOriginally, SR 60 in Clearwater traveled west of Highland Avenue along Gulf-to-Bay Boulevard and Cleveland Street to the Memorial Causeway. When construction of the new Memorial Causeway began in 2001/2002, SR 60 was realigned along Court Street and Pierce Boulevard to the Causeway, with the original alignment downloaded to the city of Clearwater. Between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Pierce, SR 60 is split into two one-way streets—Court Street carrying westbound traffic, and Chestnut Street carrying eastbound traffic.\n\nPrior to the realignment, Court Street east of Missouri Avenue was known as SR 651, while Court and Chestnut Streets west of Missouri was a locally maintained road signed as \"Bypass 60\".\n\nState Road 60A served as a bypass for Bartow, Florida, until SR 60 was realigned to follow that route in 2006. It is briefly cosigned with US 98 during its route. It is mainly known as \"Van Fleet Drive\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1993451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993451", "title": "Battle of La Forbie", "text": "Battle of La Forbie\n\nThe Battle of La Forbie, also known as the Battle of Hiribya, was fought October 17, 1244 – October 18, 1244 between the allied armies (drawn from the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the crusading orders, the breakaway Ayyubids of Damascus, Homs, and Kerak) and the Egyptian army of the Ayyubid Sultan as-Salih Ayyub, reinforced with Khwarezmian mercenaries. The resulting Ayyubid victory led to the call for the Seventh Crusade and marked the collapse of Christian power in the Holy Land. \n\nThe capture of Jerusalem by the Khwarezmians in August had caused great alarm among both the Christian and the Muslim states. Al-Mansur, the Emir of Homs and an-Nasir Dawud, ruling Kerak, joined the Templars, the Hospitallers, the Teutonic Knights, the Order of Saint Lazarus, and the remaining forces of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to take the field against the Egyptian Sultanate.\n\nThe two armies met near La Forbie, a small village northeast of Gaza. On the allied side, Al-Mansur was present in person, commanding about 2,000 cavalry and a detachment of troops from Damascus. The overall Christian command was given to Walter IV of Brienne, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon, although Robert of Nantes, Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Philip of Montfort, Constable of Jerusalem, were also present. The Christian army consisted of about 1,000 cavalry and 6,000 foot soldiers. The Transjordanian forces were under the command of Sunqur al-Zahiri and al-Waziri, and consisted of about 2,000 mounted Bedouin. The Egyptian army was commanded by a Mamluk officer named Baibars which was slightly inferior in strength to its opponents.\n\nAl-Mansur advised the allies to fortify their camp and take the defensive, waiting for the undisciplined Khwarezmians to disperse and leave the Egyptians at a considerable disadvantage. However, Walter, to whom the overall command had been given, was unwilling to refuse battle when he had the advantage of numbers, a rarity for the Christians of Outremer. The allied dispositions were as follows: Christians on the right wing, near the coast, the Emir of Homs and the Damascenes in the center, the Bedouin on the left.\n\nBattle was joined on the morning of October 17, with the Christian knights repeatedly charging the Egyptians and fighting up and down the line. The Egyptian army held its ground. On the morning of October 18, Baibars renewed the fight and threw the Khwarezmians against the Damascene troops in the center of the allied line. The center was shattered by their furious attack, after which they turned on the allied left and cut the Bedouin to pieces. The Emir's cavalry held stubbornly, but they were nearly annihilated; Al-Mansur finally rode from the field with 280 survivors, all that remained of his troops.\n\nThreatened by the Egyptians in front and the Khwarezmians on their flank, the Crusaders charged the Mamluks facing them and were initially successful, pushing them back and causing Baibars some concern. Their assault gradually lost momentum as the Khwarezmid tribesmen attacked the rear and the flanks of the Christian forces, which were defended by disorganized infantry. The well-armed knights fought on doggedly and it took several hours for their resistance to collapse.\n\nOver 5,000 Crusaders died. 800 prisoners were taken, including Walter of Brienne, William of Chastelneuf, Master of the Hospital, and the Constable of Tripoli. Of the troops of the knightly orders, only 33 Templars, 27 Hospitallers, and three Teutonic Knights survived; Philip of Montfort and the Patriarch of Jerusalem Robert of Nantes also escaped to Ascalon. However, Armand de Lavoie, the Master of the Temple, the Marshal of the Temple, the archbishop of Tyre, the bishop of Lydda and Ramla (St. George), and John and William, sons of Bohemond, Lord of Botron, were all killed.\n\nPope Innocent IV at the First Council of Lyon in 1245 called for a new Crusade, the seventh, but the Franks were never again to muster major power in the Holy Land. The Kingdom of Jerusalem suffered worst in the aftermath of La Forbie. It had not been able to put so large an army into the field since the Battle of Hattin, and would never be able to undertake offensive operations again. It brought no lasting success to the Ayyubids; the Khwarezmians were defeated outside Homs by Al-Mansur Ibrahim in 1246 after falling out with the Egyptians. Baibars (not to be confused with Al-Zahir Baibars who became a sultan), joined the Khwarezmians and was later arrested by as-Salih Ayyub and died in prison.\n\nWhile the Battle of Hattin holds great symbolic importance as having led to the fall of Jerusalem, it was La Forbie that truly marked the collapse of Christian power in Outremer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1993488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993488", "title": "Breakneck Ridge", "text": "Breakneck Ridge\n\nBreakneck Ridge is a mountain along the Hudson River between Beacon and Cold Spring, New York, straddling the boundary between Dutchess and Putnam counties. Its distinctive rocky cliffs are visible for a long distance when approached from the south, and together with Storm King Mountain on the opposite bank of the river forms Wey-Gat, or Wind Gate, the picturesque northern gateway to the Hudson Highlands.\nIt has several summits, the highest, some distance inland, reaching approximately 1,260 feet (384 m) above sea level. The southern face of the peak is remarkable for its striking cliffs, the result of quarrying in past years.\nLying within Hudson Highlands State Park, it offers many stunning views of the river and region and is quite popular with hikers, to the point that a rail flag stop has been established on the Metro North line which runs right by the base of the ridge along NY 9D.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, the mountain was also known as St. Anthony's Face or Turk's Face, after a facelike stone formation on the southern cliffs that was destroyed by quarrymen in 1846.\n\nWhile several routes exist, most hikers take the white-blazed route up the mountain's west face that begins on the West (Southbound) side of Route 9D near the tunnel. After circling around to cross above the tunnels, it begins a steep, rocky and challenging climb up to the first bump of the mountain, about 720 feet (219 m) above the river, where there are sweeping views of the river and Highlands. It continues in a similar fashion over the remaining bumps until it reaches the summit, but keeps on going and becomes a trail that travels over several other summits, and eventually peters out. However, there are other small trails that lead down from the white trail, as there are blue, red, and green trails that ascend from the various other summits that the white blazed trail crosses over. They serve as a shortcut to the base of the mountain.\n\n"}

Doughton\n\nRobert Lee \"Bob\" Doughton (November 7, 1863 – October 1, 1954), of Alleghany County, North Carolina, sometimes known as \"Farmer Bob,\" was a member of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina for 42 consecutive years (1911–1953). A Democrat originally from Laurel Springs, North Carolina, he was the Dean of the United States House of Representatives for his last few months in Congress. He is the longest-serving member ever of the United States House of Representatives from the state of North Carolina.\n\nDoughton's father was a captain in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War; he named his son Robert after Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Robert earned the equivalent of a high-school diploma from the Traphill Academy. Although he never attended college, he was awarded honorary bachelor's degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Catawba College during his political career.\n\nDoughton was married twice. His first wife, Boyd Greer, died in 1895 after only two years of marriage. He remarried in 1898 to Lillie Hix; they remained married until her death in 1946. He had two sons and two daughters. His elder brother was Rufus A. Doughton, who was at various times Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives and Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina. Doughton was a member and deacon of the Laurel Springs Baptist Church. After his death in 1954 at the age of 90 he was buried next to his wife Lillie in the church cemetery. In the 1990s Rufus Doughton's former home in Laurel Springs was restored, and it is now a popular bed-and-breakfast for tourists to the region.\n\nThe Robert L. Doughton House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nIn private life, Doughton was a prosperous farmer and banker. By 1900 he owned over of land in his native Alleghany County, North Carolina, where he raised herds of prized Hereford and Holstein cows. He was also the owner and president of the Deposit Savings and Loan Bank in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina; when the bank merged in 1936 with several other banks and formed the Northwestern Bank, Doughton briefly served as the new bank's director. His interest in farming led to his being named to the North Carolina Board of Agriculture in 1903; this marked the beginning of his career in politics. Before being elected to Congress, Doughton served one term in the North Carolina Senate (1908–09) and was director of the state Prison Board (1909–11).\n\nDoughton was for 18 years (1933–1947 and 1949–1953) the Chairman of the powerful U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, and as such he co-sponsored, held hearings on, and oversaw the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935. Doughton was also instrumental in the creation of the Blue Ridge Parkway, America's most-traveled scenic highway. The largest park and recreational area on the parkway is named in his honor. Doughton is also known for introducing the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, which effectively served as a federal ban on marijuana prohibition in the United States in lieu of federal authority to directly regulate medicines or drugs.\n\n\n"}

It operates on St. Clair Avenuebetween Yonge Street and the Line 1 Yonge–University subwayand Gunns Road, just west of Keele Street.\n\nThe Toronto Civic Railways opened the St. Clair streetcar route in 1913 along St. Clair Avenue West between Yonge Street and the Grand Trunk Railway crossing (near today's Caledonia Road) to serve small developed areas in a newly annexed section of the city. Previously, the only streetcar service near this area was the Davenport line of the Toronto Suburban Railway (along Davenport Road) and the Avenue route of the Toronto Railway Company (ending at Avenue Road and St. Clair Avenue). At the east end of the St. Clair line, passengers could connect with the radial cars of the Metropolitan line of the Toronto and York Radial Railway running on Yonge Street. The St. Clair line was double-track but had no loops or wyes; thus, all streetcars were double-ended.\n\nAfter its creation in 1921, the Toronto Transportation Commission took over the assets of the Toronto Civic Railways and the Toronto Railway Company with the goal to connect and integrate the two separate streetcar systems. With respect to St. Clair, the TTC expanded the line eastwards and westwards, adding turning loops at end points and replacing double-ended streetcars with single-ended cars (initially ex–TRC cars). At the east end, the line would continue north from St. Clair Avenue East on Mount Pleasant Road to Eglinton Avenue; however, this portion would later become a separate route that was subsequently converted to bus operation in the 1970s.\n\nBy 1930, the Bay streetcar route was running north on Avenue Road and then west on St. Clair Avenue. Passengers could travel from St. Clair Avenue and Caledonia Road to Bay Street and Queens Quay. By 1932, Earlscourt Loop at St. Clair Avenue and Lansdowne Avenue became the western terminus of the Bay route. With the opening of the Yonge subway in 1954, the Bay route disappeared, and the Earlscourt route was created to replace the St. Clair portion of the former Bay route. The Earlscourt route ran between St. Clair station and Earlscourt Loop overlapping the St. Clair route. About 1978, the Earlscourt route was merged into 512 St. Clair.\n\nWhen first built in 1913, the St. Clair streetcar operated in a dedicated right-of-way in the centre of St. Clair Avenue, similar to today's 512 St. Clair route. A dedicated right-of-way is a lane generally in the centre of the street, reserved for transit vehicles. However, it was removed between 1928 and 1935 and replaced with paved trackage open to mixed traffic.\n\nHowever, since then, road traffic had increased and was degrading the reliability of streetcar service. Given the success of the new 510 Spadina route along dedicated right-of-ways on Spadina and Queens Quay and on portions on several streetcar routes, the TTC proposed to upgrade the St. Clair streetcar line to a dedicated right-of-way. The tracks along the route needed replacement, and the TTC estimated that building a dedicated right-of-way would cost only $7 million more than simply replacing the tracks. Furthermore, St. Clair Avenue is one of the few streets in Toronto wide enough to accommodate a dedicated right-of-way without significantly reducing the width of traffic lanes.\n\nIn 2004, Toronto City Council decided to proceed with the proposal. Construction started on September 25, 2005 and was completed in three stages: From St. Clair station to Vaughan Road on February 18, 2007, to Lansdowne Avenue on December 20, 2009, and finally with full service to Gunns Loop on June 30, 2010. On December 19, 2009, the day prior to the opening of the section from Vaughan Road to Lansdowne Avenue, there was a pre-opening event utilizing the TTC's two remaining PCC streetcars.\n\nFrom July 31, 2005, until September 2, 2017, the TTC ran a pilot project of providing 2-hour time-based transfers on this route as a temporary measure to support business along St. Clair during the construction projects of the new dedicated streetcar right-of-way scheme, under which passengers who took a paper transfer after paying their fares by cash or tokens were allowed to disembark and re-board another 512 streetcar, even one going in the opposite direction, as long as they did so within 2 hours of their original boarding. This meant that one could stop part-way through a journey and then continue, or even make a round trip, without paying multiple fares. From December 14, 2015, until the September 3, 2017, passengers who paid by cash or token were required to obtain a time-based paper transfer as a result of the proof-of-payment (POP) system that had come into effect on all TTC streetcar routes as passengers could have been asked at any time to show POP. At the time, the Presto card readers on the 512 cars were not configured to handle this special route-specific time-based transfer pilot scheme. Presto users who wished to take advantage of the project were required to board at the front door of the vehicle in order to obtain the special paper time-based transfer after tapping their cards on the fare reader there, or else they would have been charged another fare every time they re-tapped on the same route. The pilot program was discontinued on September 3, 2017, the same day the new Flexity Outlook streetcars were deployed on the 512 route, as drivers of the new streetcars are situated inside a fully enclosed cab and are not responsible for handling fare collection or providing paper transfers.\n\nThe TTC reintroduced a 2-hour time-based transfer on August 26, 2018, but this time system-wide rather than for just the 512 route. It is currently available only to Presto card customers who pay single fares with stored card balance.\n\nAbout 2007, two plans had been proposed to extend the St. Clair line west of Gunns Loop, but neither are active today. At that time, transit advocate Steve Munro was of the opinion that extensions west of Gunns Loop may lack the ridership to be justified.\n\nThe first proposal would see Route 512 extended west along St. Clair Avenue West to Runnymede Road, and south underneath the Canadian Pacific Railway Galt Subdivision line to a bus loop at Runnymede Road and Dundas Street West, replacing a portion of route 71A Runnymede. Streetcar tracks would then be extended southeast along Dundas Street West to Dundas West Station where the 504 King and 505 Dundas streetcar routes currently terminate. The tracks on Dundas would be served by a new route replacing the current 40 Junction bus route. While this scheme may not be warranted by potential ridership, it would cut down the amount of deadhead (not-in-service) time required by St. Clair streetcars to get to St. Clair Avenue.\n\nThe other proposal comes as part of Transit City, the Light Rail expansion proposal. It would see route 512 extended west on St. Clair all the way to Jane Street, replacing portions of routes 71A Runnymede (now replaced by route 189 Stockyards) and 79B Scarlett Road, where it would connect with a planned Jane Street LRT.\n\nRoute 512 St. Clair serves St. Clair Avenue between St. Clair station at the east end of the line and Gunns Loop at Gunns Road at the west end. The route passes through St. Clair West station in both directions. The route operates almost entirely within a dedicated streetcar right-of-way, with mixed traffic for a short distance east of Yonge Street and for very short distances at streetcar loops. There are five turning loops along the line; besides the station loops at St. Clair and St. Clair West stations, the other loops are Oakwood Loop at Oakwood Avenue, Earlscount Loop at Lansdowne Avenue and Gunns Loop at Gunns Road. The streetcar tracks along Bathurst Street and Vaughan Road are the only connection between the St. Clair streetcar line and the rest of the Toronto streetcar system.\n\nAccording to the TTC's Trip Planner, it takes about 29 minutes to travel from St. Clair station to Gunns Loop. A 2011 \"Torontoist\" article confirmed this travel time measured shortly after the rush hour.\n\nWith the exception of stops at turning loops, all stops along the route are on-street, surface stops with islands separating the regular traffic from the streetcar tracks, and have streetcar traffic signals, partial shelters, and railings to protect patrons from the traffic. One end of each platform connects to a pedestrian crossing at a signalized street intersection. The other end of the platform has a planter. There are 22 on-street stops serving both directions, and two serving just one direction: Old Stock Yards (eastbound) and Yonge (westbound), both near a terminus.\n\nHalf of the on-street stops have an artwork consisting of vertical panels along the shelter roof. If a on-street stop has both east- and westbound platforms, then only one of the two platforms would display an artwork. Various artists were selected by competition to design the art pieces.\n\n312 St Clair–Junction operates during the overnight period. Buses are used rather than streetcars, however, stopping at the curb (sidewalk), instead of the streetcar islands.\n\nTransfer points on St. Clair Avenue and Junction Road, 312 St. Clair–Junction Blue Night bus:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1993519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993519", "title": "Chen Yonglin", "text": "Chen Yonglin\n\nChen Yonglin () is a former Chinese diplomat who sparked fears of a diplomatic incident through his defection to Australia in the summer of 2005. The episode highlighted the tensions faced by China's trade partners when concerns arise from that nation's human rights record. The episode was compared to the Petrov Affair by such observers as Shadow Minister for Immigration Laurie Ferguson and trade unionist Bill Shorten.\n\nChen had been a university student in Beijing during the pro-democracy movement that ultimately led to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Several of his friends were wounded in the ensuing repression by the government. He was said to have undergone political reeducation after the subsequent crackdown on dissidents, and joined the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1991. This culminated in his posting as the consul for political affairs in the Chinese consulate in Sydney, Australia. In this position, Chen has stated that he was responsible for monitoring Chinese political dissidents, especially Falun Gong, living in Australia. He also reportedly had access to highly classified information on Chinese intelligence activities in Australia. Chen has claimed that he had \"gone easy\" on dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners and had not reported some actions, to protest China's policies towards political dissent. He has also suggested that the Chinese government was becoming suspicious of his activities, and that as a result, he fears for his safety if returned to China. Chen remains unapologetic over his defection, insisting that he betrayed the Communist Party of China, not China.\n\nFactors contributing to the defection, according to Chen, are the torture and death of his father during the Cultural Revolution, his witness of the Tiananmen Massacre and the persecution against the Falun Gong imposed by the Chinese Authorities.\n\nOn 26 May 2005, Chen walked out of the consulate with his wife and daughter. On that day he reportedly met an officer from the Department of Immigration who contacted the Chinese consulate to verify Chen's identity. A Senate inquiry later criticized the government for this action, citing Chen's stated concern that such contact would put his life in danger.\nOn 31 May he met with a representative from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Chen has stated that he was told at this meeting that his request for political asylum had been rejected, but that he could apply for a protection visa. The story broke to the international media on 3 June, when Chen contacted \"The Australian\" newspaper, sparking fears of a serious diplomatic incident between the two nations. Anne Plunkett the director of protocol at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with Chen, who alleges that she repeatedly urged him not to defect.\n\nOn 4 June, though he allegedly feared being kidnapped, Chen came out of hiding to address a rally commemorating the 16th anniversary of the deaths in Tiananmen Square. During his speech, he claimed he would \"reveal everything he knows\". He also claimed that the Chinese government had more than a thousand agents in Australia, and that they were responsible for monitoring and kidnapping Chinese nationals back to China. Furthermore, Chen claimed that in one particular case in early 2000, Chinese agents in Sydney had kidnapped a student to force his father, Lan Fu, a former senior Chinese official to return to China.\n\nAfter the June 4th rally, Chen once again went into hiding, having claimed that he was under constant surveillance and in fear of his life. On 5 June, the Chinese embassy released a statement claiming that Chen was due to return home and had invented allegations of wrongdoing in the hope that he would be allowed to stay. The statement was intended to alleviate fears for Chen's safety if he returned to China.\n\nOn 7 June Chen's claims of a thousand-strong spy network were supported by Hao Fengjun, a former police officer with the 6-10 Office, a special security force established to eradicate Falun Gong by whatever means they deem necessary. The Chinese government responded by claiming that documents seized from Hao's home in China had shown that he was a low-level policeman suspected of corruption. Hao's lawyer, Bernard Collaery, attacked the claims, however, arguing that they were \"standard [Chinese] tactics.\" Hao was granted a protection visa by the Australian government in late July 2005.\n\nOn 7 July, a Chinese defector in Canada using the name Han Guangsheng emerged to support Chen and Hao's spying allegations. During his interview on the ABC show \"Lateline\", Han explained \"I do know that the Communist Party of China sent people to collect intelligence information, including Chinese Embassy and Consulate staff. Some of the reporters coming from state Chinese media and visiting scholars are also given special spying tasks to carry out.\" The fifty-two-year-old defector has been denied political asylum and ruled ineligible to remain in Canada, because the federal Immigration and Refugee Board found him a \"willing accomplice\" in prior human rights abuses. This appears consistent with Han's claim that he was in charge of Shenyang's public security and labor camps before his defection.\n\nChina's ambassador in Canberra, Fu Ying, condemned Chen for \"attacking his motherland\" with \"allegations and noise\" for what she claimed was the sole purpose of living in a wealthier country. She warned that many more would follow Chen, if he was allowed to relocate to Australia.\n\nOn 8 July, Chen Yonglin, his wife, and his 6-year-old daughter were granted permanent protection visas by the Immigration Department, despite the opposition of the Chinese government.\n\nFollowing the granting of protection visas to Chen and his family, he has met with Australian intelligence officials to discuss his earlier claims of a thousand-strong Chinese spy network. On 21 July Chen testified before the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights and International Operations as part of a panel discussing \"Falun Gong and China's Continuing War on Human Rights.\" Here Chen broadened his earlier charges, stating: \"I am aware there are over 1,000 Chinese secret agents and informants in Australia, and the number in the United States should not be less.\" He also testified that \"The United States and Australia are considered by the CPC as the base of the Falun Gong overseas\" and that \"Chinese diplomats are required to denounce the Falun Gong and to distribute anti-Falun Gong materials whenever it is possible.\" \n\nOn 31 July, Chen attended a public seminar hosted by the Victorian Federation of Chinese Associations without invitation. There he defended and repeated his earlier spying allegations, and went on to claim that the VFCA was \"controlled by the Chinese Consulate in Melbourne\". The vice president of the federation, Sheng Wang, denied these claims and accused Chen of damaging the reputation of all Chinese Australians as well as undermining relations between China and Australia.\n\nOn 5 August, Chen was invited to a seminar at the University of Melbourne.\n\nOn 16 August, Chen accused the Chinese government of sending a three-member assassination squad into Australia, claiming he was alerted to their presence by a close friend in the foreign ministry. Chen told ABC TV, \"they want to shut me up and ... they want to send a warning example to others who want to defect.\" Foreign Minister Alexander Downer called this \"highly improbable.\"\n\nIn late September, Chen contended that the man in charge of China's spy network continued to operate out of the consulate-general in Sydney. As reported by \"The Bulletin\", this individual works independently of the consulate, complete with his own budget. Chen did not name this alleged spymaster.\n\nIn October and November, Chen addressed the European Parliament, the Flemish Parliament of Belgium, and the British Parliament on the issue of humans rights in China. The Chinese Mission at the European Parliament sent three diplomats and three official media reporters to hear Chen's testimony at the European Parliament. While Chen was addressing to the British All-Party Parliamentary Group on Human Rights at the Palace of Westminster, President Hu Jintao was visiting Westminster. Prime Minister Tony Blair was forced to raise the human rights issue with Hu under the pressure of overwhelming media attention.\n\nOn 30 March 2006, Chen joined more than 4000 signatories in an open letter to Australian Prime Minister John Howard to question Premier Wen Jiabao regarding the persecution against human rights lawyers in China by the Chinese Authorities and concern about allegations of live organ harvesting at the Shenyang Thrombosis Hospital despite official Chinese denials.\n\n"}

He played college football for Texas A&M University. He was drafted in the first round of the 2003 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots, and also played for the NFL's Denver Broncos.\n\nWarren was raised in Bryan, Texas by his single mother and maternal grandparents. His family was poor, therefore he helped raise his siblings and worked odd jobs from an early age. At the local Boys and Girls Club, he met his wife, Kesha Drayton, with whom he has six daughters, two of them being twins. Warren continues to give back to his hometown. His uncle, Curtis Dickey, was an All-American tailback at Texas A&M (1976–79), where he ranks second on the career rushing list and was selected in the first round of the 1980 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Colts.\n\nWarren attended Bryan High School, where he was a letterman in both football and track. In football, he was a standout at defensive end and finished his career with 22 sacks, 248 tackles (69 for losses), and 90 quarterback hurries. As a senior, he won first team All-State honors and posted nine sacks and 109 tackles. Warren took his first airplane trip when he flew to California to play for an all-star game. Warren graduated from Bryan High in 1999.\n\nWarren attended Texas A&M University, where he majored in agricultural development and played for the Texas A&M Aggies football team from 1999 to 2002. In football, he played across the defensive line in his career, starting games at both defensive end and tackle. After appearing in five games as a freshman in 1999, Warren started the last eight games of his sophomore season in 2000, finishing the year with 38 tackles and five sacks while leading the team in tackles for a loss. He moved to defensive tackle in 2001, starting seven games there en route to an All-Big 12 Conference first-team selection. In his senior season in 2002, Warren moved back to defensive end, starting 10 games and recording 52 tackles. He finished his college career with 144 tackles and 13.5 sacks, plus two blocked field goals.\n\nIn the 2010 NFL offseason, Ty Warren went back to Texas A&M to finish his degree, and graduated in May 2011, becoming the first college graduate in his family.\n\nPatriots head coach Bill Belichick and his scouts were so impressed by Warren's college performance that they made a trade in order to get him at No. 13 in the first round of the 2003 NFL Draft. Warren played in all 16 games in the 2003 season, starting four times and recording 33 tackles and one sack. Warren collected his first career sack when he sacked Miami Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler for a 1-yard loss in the first quarter of the Patriots' 19-13 overtime victory on October 13. Warren earned his first Super Bowl ring playing as a reserve in the Patriots' victory over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII. In the 2004 season, Warren became a starter at defensive end in the Patriots' 3-4 system and played in all 16 games, and recorded 48 tackles and 3.5 sacks. He played in Super Bowl XXXIX against the Philadelphia Eagles and earned his second Super Bowl ring for the Patriots' victory. In 2005, Warren again started all 16 games at defensive end, picking up 68 tackles and 1.5 sacks.\nWarren improved his statistics in 2006, recording a career-high of 84 tackles (56 solo), 1 safety and 7.5 sacks. He was named to \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Peter King's All-Pro team, but not the Pro Bowl. Following the season, Warren was named among the players who should have made the Pro Bowl, and among the more underrated players in the NFL.\n\nWarren's teammates elected him a team captain before the 2007 season. On August 16, 2007, he signed a five-year contract extension with the Patriots through 2013. The contract has a maximum value of $35 million and guaranteed $18 million. In 2007, Warren ranked second in the team in tackles (83), quarterback hits (15), and fumble recoveries (3). He made four sacks.\n\nIn a press conference the week before Super Bowl XLII in February 2008, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick praised Warren's work ethic, attitude, and leadership. Belichick also pointed out that Warren had worked the hardest and had done nothing but work hard to improve since he was drafted in 2003. When Warren received his five-year contract extension, Belichick simply told him \"Congratulations, get back to work.\"\n\nWarren's 2008 season was reduced to 13 games because of a groin injury that caused Warren to miss three games in November and December, only the second season in which Warren had missed time due to injury. Warren finished the season with 41 tackles and two sacks. In early 2009, Warren had surgery to repair the groin injury as well as a prior sports hernia injury.\n\nWarren started the first eight games of 2009 before he missed a Week 10 matchup against the Indianapolis Colts with an ankle injury. He left a Week 14 game against the Carolina Panthers with an ankle injury and did not play in the Patriots' final three games; he started the Patriots' playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens. He finished the regular season with 46 tackles and one sack.\n\nAfter suffering a hip injury during training camp, Warren was placed on injured reserve on August 13, 2010, ending his season. On July 29, 2011, it was announced that Warren had been released by the New England Patriots.\n\nOn August 2, 2011, he was signed by the Denver Broncos. He missed the entire 2011-2012 season with a triceps injury suffered early in training camp. After being asked by the Broncos to take a pay cut, he held out of the team's Organized Team Activities until June 6, 2012, when the Broncos and Warren agreed to a restructured contract. On September 7, 2012 (week 1 of the regular season) he tore his triceps again and missed the rest of the 2012 season. Warren did not sign with any team after the 2012 season.\n"}
{"id": "1993537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993537", "title": "Chief risk officer", "text": "Chief risk officer\n\nThe chief risk officer (CRO) or chief risk management officer (CRMO) of a firm or corporation is the executive accountable for enabling the efficient and effective governance of significant risks, and related opportunities, to a business and its various segments. Risks are commonly categorized as strategic, reputational, operational, financial, or compliance-related. CROs are accountable to the Executive Committee and The Board for enabling the business to balance risk and reward. In more complex organizations, they are generally responsible for coordinating the organization's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach. The CRO is responsible for assessing and mitigating significant competitive, regulatory, and technological threats to a firm's capital and earnings. The CRO roles and responsibilities vary depending on the size of the organization and industry. The CRO works to ensure that the firm is compliant with government regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, and reviews factors that could negatively affect investments. Typically, the CRO is responsible for the firm's risk management operations, including managing, identifying, evaluating, reporting and overseeing the firm's risks externally and internally to the organization and works diligently with senior management such as Chief Executive officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe role of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is becoming increasing important in financial, investment, and insurance sectors. According to Watson, the majority of CROs agreed that having only exceptional analytical skill is not sufficient. The most successful CROs are able to combine these skills with highly developed commercial, strategic, leadership and communication skill to be able to drive change and make a difference in an organization. CROs typically have post graduate education with over 20 years of experience in accounting, economics, legal or actuarial backgrounds.\nA business may find a risk acceptable; however, the company as a whole may not. CROs need to balance risks with financial, investment, insurance, personnel and inventory decisions to obtain an optimum level for stakeholders. According to a study by Morgan McKinley, a successful CRO must be able to deal with complexity and ambiguity, and understand the bigger picture.\n\nJames Lam, a noted risk professional, is credited as the first person to coin the term. Lam is the first person to hold that position at GE Capital in 1993. The position became more common after the Basel Accord, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Turnbull Report.\n\nA main priority for the CRO is to ensure that the organization is in full compliance with applicable regulations and to analyze all risk related issues. They may also be required to work alongside other senior executives such as with a chief compliance officer. They may deal with topics regarding insurance, internal auditing, corporate investigations, fraud, and information security. The responsibilities and requirements to become a chief risk officer vary depending on the size of the organization and the industry, however most CRO's typically have a masters-degree level of education and 10 to 20 years of business-related experience, with actuarial, accounting, economics, and legal backgrounds common. There are many different pathways to become a CRO but most organizations prefer to promote their own employees to the position internally.\n\nA chief risk officer (CRO) is relatively considered a newer position in the board of directors. When comparing the function of a CRO to the rest of the officers, we find that there is a relationship with every other role. In other words, for a process in any department in a firm to be completed it has to be discussed with a CRO to clear it of potential risks. In general, the CRO has many crucial tasks to look for in any organization to better serve its needs and mitigate its risk. According to the Enterprise Risk Management Initiative, CROs need to find a way to balance risks and inventory decisions to obtain an optimum level for stakeholders and maintain a positive reputation regarding the firm. However, the job description of CRO there is more in depth, there are some general tasks which every CRO has to be familiar with, such as, understanding the concept of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).\n\nA Chief risk officer must identify, assess, measure, manage, monitor and report every aspect of the risk function of new implementations of the firm. This task is important when translating business requirements of the firm into business/reporting and system specifications. Also, the CRO's assistance is necessary when it comes to new developments. Risk Chiefs must be leaders in developing and improving management reporting as well as providing user training for in-house developed systems. In addition to developing policies and frameworks, the CRO is responsible for training and supervision of employees. Another important task is managing the development of new risk policies and procedures and participating in local and global discussions to enhance security processes and standards.\nThe role of the CRO is still evolving as the scope of task is constantly changing. The increasing regulatory and legislative requirements of organizational compliance makes the CRO to one of the most important member of the management team. To be able to view risk in the context of the whole company and to organize different risk functions and task through the different entities of the organization, is inevitable to the success of any structural planning.\n\nThe title of a CRO is a fairly new position in a company that is continually evolving. The responsibility of a CRO can be supported by the CEO or CFO. However, having an independent position to mitigate risks close to the executive board is a real asset for the company. Although the title of CRO is fairly new, job titles such as CFOs and CEOs also have functions of a CRO. Related positions of a CRO include CEO, CFO, Chief Risk Management Officer, Risk Manager and Capital Manager. Although these related positions don't necessarily replace a CRO, they do hold job functions that are similar to those of a CRO.\n\nSome names can be cited as examples of Chief Risk Officer. This new position is found in many different industries. The major one is in the financial sector. For instance, Craig Broderick is the CRO of Goldman Sachs in the United States with nine years of experience, Joachim Oechslin works for Credit Suisse in Switzerland as CRO and Thomas Wilson ensures to mitigate risk at Allianz in Germany. Companies in other industries have hired CROs in order to become more competitive. For example, Stefano Rettore is the CRO of Archer Daniels Midland while being a member of the executive board. Vijay Patil has more than ten years of experience in this function and is the CRO of Yamaha.\n\nOn August 1993, James Lam became the first worldwide CRO at GE Capital. He is called the inventor of the ERM model. As a CRO, Lam's responsibilities were to mitigate the risks of the company. He managed the credit risks, market risk, risk transfer and hedge risk. In 1995, a few company executives started to hire CROs in their organizations. But the demand was still low in the CRO position. In 2002, the US government released a new law which influenced the CRO industry significantly. The Sarbanes Oxley Act which gets popular with 2004 says that directors or executive are more severe against counterfeit of financial corporate information. By hiring CROs, companies have started to protect the executives more. Ten years later, 2005, almost all big companies that were making sales over a billion dollar hired a CRO in their enterprise. These companies were almost in a difficult environment and that's why they began to recognize the importance of a CRO. Another boost for the CRO role was the financial crisis in 2008. Many companies became bankruptcy and many jobs were destroyed. After these events, more and more CROs were hired. With the increase in regulation in the economy, the position of the CRO is gaining more importance. The worldwide globalization is also increasing the importance of CROs. As of 2017, there are more than 1000 CROs worldwide. Most of them come from the financial service, energy or commodity industry. In the future, the importance of the CRO will be measured by the complexity of the compliance risk.\n\nThe characteristics and qualifications of a Chief Risk Officer are dependent on the industry and the type of the business they are working in. For example, if the CRO were involved in the finance industry, a postgraduate education along with at least ten years of experience in accounting, economics, internal audit, risk management, strategic planning, or actuarial backgrounds would typically be a common characteristic along with many years in the banking sector. \nAlong with their extensive knowledge of the rules and regulations in finance, they usually would have held a position in the first/mid-level management up to senior executive for their past qualification in the industry. Having to understand the compliance with government regulations such as Sarbanes Oxley of 2002, it is common for CRO's to have also held a Chief Financial Officer position prior to becoming a Chief Risk Officer. With their quantitative background in math, finance, and accounting - making the change to risk management would be a familiar experience. Whether in the technology, retail, healthcare, or finance industry - the qualities of a typical Chief Risk Officer are very similar throughout the industries. Their financial expertise will aid in creating reporting procedures that will monitoring any critical risks an organization may encounter.\n\nChief Risk Officer salaries vary widely, and depend on the company and status the specific CRO achieved.\n\nThe average pay for a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) with Regulatory Compliance skills in the US is about $162,274 per year. Risk Officers who work for banks earn slightly more at $180,970. Those managing risks for private corporations are paid a higher average salary of $216,000 annually.\n\nChief Risk Officers are in the bottom tenth percentile with a salary of $72,750. However, CROs with years of effectiveness and successful developments often pass the quarter million mark annually, so there is no earnings limit.[https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/chief-risk-officer-salary-SRCH_KO0,18.htm <nowiki>[2]</nowiki>][http://www.master-of-finance.org/job-profiles/chief-risk-officer/ <nowiki>[3]</nowiki>]\n\nIn the following some examples are given:\n\nEnterprise Risk Management, ERM, is a fairly new process of managing risk within a company. Although ERM has yet to be widely accepted as an industry standard since there are various definitions as to what ERM exactly is, more recognition and acceptance of ERM has been shown. There are seminars dedicated to ERM explaining the process and providing examples of applications while also discussing advances in the field. Papers on ERM are also beginning to appear in journals and books which are starting to be published. Some universities are even starting to offer courses regarding ERM and the process.\n\nA definition provided by the committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2004 defines ERM as a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be with its appetite, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity objectives.\n\nAnother definition provided by the International Organization of Standardization (ISO 3100) defines ERM as coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk.\n\nAccording to James Lam, the definition of ERM is a value added function can be described as the inclusive and cohesive framework for managing key risks in order to achieve business goals, mitigate unexpected earnings unpredictability, and increase firm value to reduce risk which is a variable that can cause deviation from an expected outcome.\n\nAccording to James Lam, author of the book “Enterprise Risk Management,” there are several primary benefits of using ERM: 1) enhanced organizational effectiveness, 2) increased efficiency in terms of risk reporting, 3) improved business performance.\n\nOrganizational effectiveness helps address special and specific risks by creating the top-down coordination needed to form an integrated team suited to handle both independent risks and interdependencies between risks. Moreover, ERM has been said to increased risk management awareness allowing for more efficient operational and strategic decision making. This is done through the appointment of a chief risk officer and the establishment of an enterprise risk function.\n\nRisk reporting assists both the chief risk officer of an organization and the board of governors in identifying key risk factors that may prove detrimental to the company in both the present and the future. Thus, ERM enables senior management to identify, measure, and limit to acceptable levels the net exposures faced by the firm. Being able to create risk transparency allows a firm to better hedge against those particular risks or avoid them all together.\n\nBetter business performance is yet another benefit of using ERM. Companies that adopt an ERM approach have seen improvements in areas requiring key management decisions from capitol allocations to product development and pricing to mergers and acquisitions. As a result, this leads to the benefits and improvements gained from utilizing an ERM approach can be seen in the form of loss reduction, improved shareholder value, decreased earning volatility, and an increase in the firms’ earnings.\n\nThe ERM model implies the leadership by an individual who is responsible for the development and implication of an ERM strategy and assists the senior management in terms of risk management. In order to do this a CRO sets up a risk management framework and policies based on the ERM strategy. Furthermore, he implements reports and risk indicators to communicate the risk culture throughout the firm. These reports assist the CRO in creating a risk profile. He is communicating the firms risk profile to the key stakeholders such as the CEO, the board of directors and business partners. The optimizing of the risk portfolio is another assigned task by the ERM. He advises for firm projects from a risk management point of view and uses regulations and risk transfer strategies in order to mitigate the risk.\n\nERM vs Silo\n\nERM: An ERM requires an integrated risk organization what normally means, that a centralized risk management unit has to report to the CEO and the board of directors. The Chief risk officer in an ERM is responsible for knowing and gathering information over all the different aspects within an organization. He takes a portfolio view of all types of risks within the company. In an ERM approach the use of insurance and alternative risk transfer products is only considered if the risk seemed undesirable or unwanted to the management. Integration of risk management in the whole company's business process becomes necessary. The ERM optimizes business performance by influencing different aspects like pricing and resource allocation. There are three major benefits connected to the use of the ERM approach and the CRO as liaison: Due to the fact that a CRO and an integrated team can better manage individual risks and interdependencies between these risks, the use of an ERM leads to an increased organizational effectiveness. Apart from this fact, a better risk reporting can be reached by prioritizing the content of risk reporting that should go to the different instances like the senior management or the board of directors. A side effect of this information prioritizing is a much better transparency throughout the whole organization. Last but not least you can also reach a better overall business performance in the company. This is only possible if the risk management team uses an ERM approach and supports key management decisions like pricing, product development or Mergers and Acquisition. Given the support, there will be several benefits like increased earnings and improved shareholder value. An ERM can combine and integrate several risk silos into a firm-wide risk portfolio and can consider aspects as volatility and correlation of all risk exposures. This can lead to a maximization of the diversification's benefits.\n\nSILO: Under a Silo approach, risk transfer strategies are executed under a transactional or individual risk level. As an example insurance can be mentioned, which transfers out operational risk. Risk assessment and quantification processes are not integrated. Value-at-risk models are used to quantify the market risk and credit default models are used to estimate credit risk. Both specific models could be used independently, still: that it is not the case in the Silo approach. There are different effects that can be caused by this less integrative model: Over-hedging and far too much insurance cover can be a result of not incorporating all the different kinds of risk and their wide diversification. Another characteristic of the Silo approach is the continuous fighting of one crisis after another without having an integrative concept or a specific individual that can be held responsible. No one specifically takes responsibility for aspects like the overall risk reporting or other risk-related unit supplies. Further more there is another aspect that shows a weakness of this model: Having different organizational units to address every specific risk that then first has to be segmented in the company definitely speaks for a less effective technique. In the Silo approach the different business units use various methodologies to track counterparty risks. This can become a problem, if you look at the total counterparty exposure: it can get too great to be managed by all the different business units.\n\nRisk Champion:\n\nAfter a near miss or an actual crisis managers are often alarmed and focus more on all aspect of risk during the ongoing inspection. They are looking at aspects like the compliance risk and they are reinforcing important roles for the board. All these actions often lead to the naming of a risk champion who is then responsible for developing and establishing an ERM approach. In many companies the risk champion is becoming more and more a formal senior management position: the CRO. One of the important function of a risk champion that should be mentioned is his/her support to legitimize the implementation of the risk management itself. Apart from this fact he also helps the institution follow its objectives and better site it for the future. Further more he is also responsible for communicating its benefits. Normally a risk champion should have the different characteristics like skills, knowledge and leadership qualities, necessary to handle all the different specific aspects that can occur in the process of risk management. Other aspects that should be mentioned considering the responsibilities of a risk champion is his duty to intervene in instances where risk management efforts are actually disabled. This can be caused by the management itself or a lack of institutional skills. Additional he also provides support to the whole risk management process if a problematic, complicated risk occurs. In this case he can use the multiple participant approach. Assisting the risk owner, but not assuming his or her role to help find a solution for his/her problem is also one of the many duties a risk champion has to face. In some studies the risk champion is described as some kind of troubleshooter who alleviates risk related problems. After all you can summarize that the risk champion hast to be integrated into the company's ERM approach and by this contribute to the institution's goals and objectives.\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a US act of 2002. In response to various financial scandals, the U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This act also can be called Sarbox or Sox. First of all, Sarbanes-Oxley sought to enhance the integrity of corporate financial reporting and better regulate the accounting profession. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies for every company which is registered by SEC; therefore, international companies are included as well.\n\nFurthermore, it regulates and set standards for companies to protect shareholders and the public from accounting errors as well as generates more transparency between reporting and the markets.\n\nThus, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act enhanced corporate financial reports and made several reforms in the accounting profession. Enhancements occurred in the financial statements; therefore, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a company's executive chief officer and chief financial officer to clarify the precision of its financial reports. Moreover, to ensure the mentioned accuracy of financial reports, internal controls are required. Accordingly, each financial report required an internal control report to prevent fraud. Furthermore, the CRO has to be aware of everything occurring in his company on a daily basis, but he must also be current on all of the requirements from the SEC. In addition, the CRO restrains corporate risk by managing compliance.\n\nWhy is a CRO so important in financial institutions?\n\nThere is a report of having a CRO from 93% of all financial institutions that have more complex operations. A few institutions also established a chief compliance officer position. Integrating risk and finance can lead to getting more successful results and achieving strategic goals. Due to the fact that by using both: CRO and CFO, both skill sets are brought together. This can lead to the fact that the CFO's pressure is relieved and he can focus more on helping organizations direct their activities and find new opportunities to growth. The CEO of Zions Bancorporation, Harris Simmons once wrote that there would be an „uncontested need for an independent risk management in large banking organizations“. But in his opinion “covered companies should be allowed a measure of flexibility in determining how such an organization should be structured”. According to Thomas Stanton, author of „Why Some Firms Thrive and Others Fail“, one of the differences between a company that was successful and another one that was not successful during the financial crisis, was their „application of a constructive dialogue“. On the one hand there were the employees who were responsible for making money by selling products and financial services and on the other hand there were the ones responsible for limiting risks.\nDue to the fact that bank regulators have actually encouraged banks now for a longer time to adopt an enterprise risk management approach, the need of a CRO to manage risk across the whole organization has increased. You can see a close coordination between Finance and Risk Management if you take a look at how a risk model is developed. Data of the risk model are often “created by finance” and their outcomes exert influence on the financial reporting. Here you can clearly see the interdependencies. Its no longer the case that risk and finance can be seen independent. The integration between finance and risk platforms may also relax different aspects like calculation or the integration of Data. After all it can be said, that the banking industry would rarely need this systematic approach today if it would have employed more chief risk officers before the financial crisis began.\n\nCOSO, a Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, uses the concept of Enterprise Risk Management for the first time. In this context, they published in 2004 the Enterprise Risk Management—Integrated Framework. In the past years the complexity of risk has changed, and new risks have emerged why COSO published in 2017 the updated framework of ERM. This framework includes five interrelated components which are found in the most ERM frameworks.\n\nGovernance and Culture establishes organizational processes and defines desired cultures to measure and manage risk across the company. The result is a top-down risk management.\n\nStrategy and Objective-Setting formulates business objectives which put strategy into practice. The business objectives are a basis for identifying, assessing, and responding to risk. Also, Strategy and Objective-Setting analyzes business context, defines risk appetite and evaluates alternative strategies.\n\nPerformance identifies, assesses severity, and prioritizes risks which may impact the achievement of strategy and business objectives. Later, the company selects risk responses and develops a portfolio view. In the last step, the results are reported to key risk stakeholders.\n\nReview and Revision consider how well the enterprise risk management components are functioning over time. Also, it reviews risk and performance, and, if necessary, improves the company and their risk management.\nInformation, Communication, and Reporting. To communicate risk information and create reports on risk, culture, and performance to the company's key stakeholders.\n\nCorporate governance\n\nThe Sarbanes Oxley Act, which was created in 2002 to prevent corporate fraud, was the reason for the rise of the importance of corporate governance. Hence the ERM requires that the following management responsibilities be assigned: to define a firm's “risk profile”; this means it is required to evaluate the firm's willingness to take risks and threats and the possible outcomes. This is important to determine proper investment asset allocation. Also, to ensure firm has necessary risk management skills. Risk management skills involves the risk management process which consists of 5 steps: risk assessment, risk analysis, risk treatment, risk acceptance, and risk communication. Thirdly, to establish the organization's structure with all roles and responsibilities. This involves assigning different enterprise risk management roles throughout the organization, and establishing a clear hierarchy structure.\n\nRisk management integration also plays an important role in corporate governance. This means identifying the degree of harm derived from a certain threat or risk and balancing the costs and benefits of the possible methods to eliminate or reduce the risk. It is crucial to establish risk assessment and audit processes to avoid corruption within a corporation's risk management process. There must be auditor's who authorize the decisions of the risk managers before they are implemented.\n\nSetting the risk culture of the firm starting at the top: The CEO is an important step in corporate governance. Establishing a hierarchy chart for the company's risk management roles is a critical step to ensure clear communication of the tasks and duties in the ERM process. It is also important to create an ongoing employee training program; a strong employee training program means there is less employee mistakes therefore less money wasted within the corporation, and this could also avoid big issues such as bankruptcy or bad company reputation.\n\nManagement\" \"\n\nUsing the concept of Line vs Staff Positions in the Firm ERM means that in certain situations the line managers should seek advice from the staff beneath them. Using the Line Vs Staff concept does the following: aligns the production process with the corporate risk policy, incorporates expected losses and cost of risk capital into production pricing and the hurdle rate, and creates an efficient and transparent risk review process to give production managers better understanding of acceptable risks.\n\nThis should help reduce the volatility of the company's earnings, thus enhancing shareholder value. With an organized approach to risk, a firm can better manage its risks and returns to make more informed decisions about capital and investments.\n\nPortfolio management\n\nERM requires that management act as a portfolio fund manager who identifies the firm's risk profile which is essentially a representation at a given point of time of an organization's overall exposure to risks. ERM also requires that management set risk limits within a range of risks. When risk taking is authorized, risk limits are bounds placed on that risk-taking decision.\n\nERM produces diversification benefits for the company. Diversification benefit arises when two processes are not completely dependent on each other, and a bad (good) outcome for one process does not necessarily mean a bad (good) outcome for the other. Dependency and diversification are opposite sides of the same coin; when the strength of a dependency is increased, the level of diversification benefit is reduced.\n\nOne part of the ERM Model is risk transfer. Per the terms and conditions the CRO must decide to spread the risk to an external party or to retain the risks. If he spreads the risk then it moves to an external party, but it can also go to a subsidiary. In general, the companies transfer risk by purchasing different kinds of insurance. The three favorite types of insurance are workers' compensation, general liability, and property / casualty insurance.\n\nStakeholders are all individuals or groups of people who are in contact with the company. As the need for information grows in importance, management must respond to better risk visibility for the stakeholder groups. These include employees, customers, supporters, offerers, business partners, creditors and other stakeholders. Stakeholder managers provide useful information about the risk situation and financial position to stakeholders so that they can make the right investment decisions.\n\nThe chief risk officer (CRO) is a senior executive officer that reports to the CEO and/or the board of directors. The CRO manages the risk management department and provides information to help mitigate internal and external risk factors of the company and ensures that the company is in compliance with government regulations. \n\nThe introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley act (SOX) has promoted the need and adaptation of the CRO role. A main priority of the CRO is to ensure that the company complies with SOX to ensure they are following government regulations. SOX introduced new legal regulations that becomes legal and compliance risk(s) for companies. With the introduction of SOX, the corporate officers could be held liable for failure to produce accurate financial reports and standings in the company. The CRO's job is to help the company become compliant with government regulations, transparent, and help mitigate risk for the company.\n\n\nThe Rise of the CRO in Executive Middle East Magazine, https://web.archive.org/web/20111114213418/http://www.executive-magazine.com/getarticle.php?article=14802\n"}

In the mid-1990s, he switched to painting.\n\nFriedman's work has appeared in such periodicals as \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Newsweek\", \"Time\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The New Yorker\", \"The New Republic\", \"The New York Observer\", \"Esquire\", \"RAW\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"The Village Voice\" and \"Mad\". His works have been anthologized in seven collections, and he has illustrated a number of books, including Howard Stern's \"Private Parts\" and \"Miss America,\" as well as books of portraits released under his own name.\n\nSince the 1990s, Friedman has provided caricature illustrations for mainstream publications. However, he first attracted public attention in the 1980s producing morbid alternative comics stories, sometimes working solo, sometimes with his brother Josh Alan Friedman scripting the panels. These stories portrayed celebrities and character actors of yesteryear in seedy, absurd, tragi-comic situations. The brothers also wrote stories about talk-show host Joe Franklin, including one strip, written by Drew, for \"Heavy Metal\", \"The Incredible Shrinking Joe Franklin\", that prompted Franklin to sue the artist for $40 million. The suit was later dismissed. Novelist Kurt Vonnegut Jr. compared his work to Goya's.\n\nThe Friedman brothers were first published in \"RAW Magazine\". Working with and without his brother, Drew's comics were published in \"Heavy Metal\", \"Weirdo\", \"High Times\", \"National Lampoon\" and other comics anthologies from the 1980s into the early 1990s. The brothers published two collections, \"Any Similarity to Persons Living or Dead is Purely Coincidental\" and \"Warts and All\". In a \"Comics Journal\" interview, Drew Friedman lamented that he and his brother had failed to earn a living creating work that was time- and labor-intensive yet earned little. Josh gave up comics to become a journalist and a musician.\n\nBeginning in 1986, Drew illustrated a monthly feature, \"Private Lives of Public Figures,\" for \"Spy\"; these illustrations were compiled in a book published by St. Martin's Press in 1992. He also provided illustrations for Howard Stern's two best-selling books, \"Private Parts\" and \"Miss America\". Friedman served as comics editor for the \"National Lampoon\" in 1991, introducing the works of Daniel Clowes and Chris Ware to a wider audience. Since 1994, he has provided regular front-page illustrations for the \"New York Observer\".\n\nIn 2006, Friedman published \"Old Jewish Comedians\" (Fantagraphics Books), a collection of portraits of famous and forgotten Jewish comics of film and TV in their old age, about which Steven Heller, in the New York Times Book Review, wrote: \"A festival of drawing virtuosity and fabulous craggy faces... Friedman might very well be the Vermeer of the Borscht Belt.\" A sequel, \"More Old Jewish Comedians\" (Fantagraphics Books), was published in 2008. A collection of newer work, \"The Fun Never Stops!\" was published by Fantagraphics in 2007.\n\nDescribing his illustration style in 2017, Friedman said it might not appeal to \"people who find warts, pimples, wrinkles, flop-sweat, jowls, boils, rosacea, nose hairs, ear hairs, drool, baggy eyes, gin blossoms, moles, liver spots, neck waddles, nasal labia folds, crinkles, furrows, creases, puss, pustules, bumps, lumps, yellowing and/or rotting teeth, missing teeth, gums, dentures, saliva, double chins, triple chins, blotches, scars, lumps, zits, five o’clock shadows, folds, bulbous noses, craters, chapped lips, man-boobs, goiters, pock marks, whiteheads, blackheads, rashes, nose leakages, emasculations, calluses, scabs, balding/bald heads, nodules, freckles, protuberances, welts, carbuncles, papules, festers, and Shemp distasteful,\" adding, \"Liver spots are my Ninas.\"\n\nWhile continuing to accept commercial assignments, Friedman began working as a portrait fine artist. \"It helps if I’m passionate about the subject I’m drawing,\" he said in a 2015 interview. \"As I get older I have less patience to draw someone or something I have no connection to or don’t really like, or hate, even a politician. I just don’t like the idea of staring into the face of someone I detest for several days drawing him or her. It’s unsettling.\"\n\nFriedman was one of the artists photographed in his studio for \"The Artist Within: Book 2: Behind the Lines\" by photographer Greg Preston, published in 2017.\n\nFriedman attended New York's School of Visual Arts from 1978 to 1981. While there, he took classes from (among others) Will Eisner, Harvey Kurtzman, Edward Sorel, Art Spiegelman, Stan Mack and Arnold Roth. During his tenure at SVA, Friedman edited both Eisner and Kurtzman's year-end magazines of student work (\"Will Eisner's Gallery of New Comics\" and \"Kartunz\", respectively) Friedman's classmates at SVA included Mark Newgarden, Mike Carlin and Kaz.\n\nHe is the son of author/satirist Bruce Jay Friedman.\n\nFriedman was recognized for his work with the National Cartoonists Society's Newspaper Illustration Award for 2000, and he was nominated again in 2002 and 2007. That organization also awarded Friedman their Magazine Illustration Award for 2000.\n\n\n"}

The Huffington Post said he \"has a brisk, bold style that gives his city scenes a jolt of painterly drama.\" \"Southwest Art Magazine\" called him \"a chronicler of the fading urban remains of a bygone era.\"\n\nWray was the son of a lieutenant colonel in Army intelligence, and his family moved frequently, living in Germany, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. Wray often read comic books and watched animated cartoons. In 2009, Wray said, \"I was always drawing because I was lonely.\"\n\nAt age 10, his family settled Costa Mesa, California. Wray would later attend and drop out of Orange Coast College — to animate professionally during the day and study art privately weekends and nights with a retired Disney animator. He subsequently animated for Disney, Hanna-Barbera and Filmation.\n\nIn 1985, Wray moved to New York, doing comic book work for Marvel and DC Comics, while studying at New York's Art Students League. A phone call from John Kricfalusi sent him back West from the early 1990s through the 2000s to work on \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\", \"Samurai Jack\", \"The Mighty B!\" and other shows. Since 2010, Wray has worked with Rauch Brothers Animation on animated shorts for StoryCorps.\n\nHis long-run \"Monroe\" series appeared in more than 100 issues of \"Mad\", and he has also co-created Dark Horse Comics \"Hellboy Junior\" with Mike Mignola based on the Hellboy character. His cartoon influences include Hank Ketcham, Harvey Kurtzman, Erich Sokol and Wally Wood.\n\nWray now concentrates on landscape oil paintings of landscapes, figures, and urban settings. Wray has said his attitude and approach to his paintings is an attempt to document aspects of urban California that continue to vanish:\n\nWray's approach to painting was influenced by Edgar Alwin Payne, Emil Gruppe, J. C. Leyendecker and other artists.

His father was a U.S. Air Force meteorologist named Steve Thompson, married to a woman in the United States at the time. Thompson, who had been redeployed to Vietnam before his son's birth, briefly visited young Hideki and his mother a year later, but they would not again meet until after Irabu reached the U.S. major leagues. Hideki's mother, Kazue, a native of Miyako, later married a restaurateur, Ichiro Irabu, from Osaka. Irabu raised Hideki as his son in Amagasaki, Hyōgo Prefecture.\n\nIrabu pitched for the Lotte Orions, who later became the Chiba Lotte Marines, of the Pacific League from 1988 to 1996. He was known as a high-speed pitcher and in 1993, he threw a 158 km/h (98 mph) fastball against Kazuhiro Kiyohara of the Seibu Lions. This was the fastest clocked pitch in all of Japanese Professional Baseball (NPB) until 2005, when the record was broken by Marc Kroon of the Yokohama BayStars.\n\nIrabu led the Pacific League in wins in 1994 (15) and in ERA in 1995 and 1996 (2.53 & 2.40, respectively). He also led the Pacific League in strikeouts in 1994 and 1995 (239 & 167, respectively).\n\nIn 1997, the San Diego Padres purchased Irabu's contract from the Chiba Lotte Marines. The criticisms of this sale from other MLB teams, who wished to bid on Irabu, led to the creation of the posting system currently used by Japanese and MLB teams. Irabu, however, refused to sign with the Padres, saying he would only play with the Yankees. For the negotiating rights to Irabu, the Yankees offered the Padres a choice of one from a list of players including Brian Boehringer, David Weathers, Chris Cumberland, Andy Fox and Matt Luke. The Padres eventually included him as a player-to-be-named-later in a trade that involved Homer Bush and Irabu going to the New York Yankees in exchange for Rafael Medina, Rubén Rivera, and $3 million in cash. The Yankees signed Irabu to a $12.8 million, four-year contract, and after only eight minor league appearances, the Yankees put him in their rotation.\n\nIrabu made his highly publicized debut on July 10, 1997, drawing almost twice as many fans that night as they averaged for weeknight games. He played with the Yankees from 1997 through 1999, winning two World Series rings (1998, 1999) despite only pitching in one postseason game and having no postseason decisions. George Steinbrenner publicly expressed disgust at his weight, at one point calling him a \"fat pussy toad\" after he failed to cover first base on a ground ball during a spring training game. Steinbrenner refused to let Irabu accompany the team to Los Angeles, but two days later, Steinbrenner apologized and allowed Irabu to join the team.\n\n1998 was Irabu's best season in MLB, featuring career bests in games started (28), complete games (2), innings pitched (173), wins (13), and ERA (4.06). Despite his inconsistency, Irabu was twice named the American League's Pitcher of the Month: in May 1998 and June 1999.\n\nAfter the 1999 season, he was traded to the Montreal Expos for Ted Lilly, Christian Parker, and Jake Westbrook. He started only 14 games for the Expos in 2000 and 2001, pitching 71⅓ innings with a 6.69 ERA and only 2 wins against 7 losses.\n\nIn 2002, he signed as a free agent to pitch for the Texas Rangers as a closer.\n\nAt the end of the 2002 season, Irabu moved back to Japan to pitch in the Hanshin Tigers' starting rotation for the 2003 season, helping the team win the Central League pennant for the first time since 1985.\n\nBefore the 2004 season, he pitched 2004 MLB Japan Opening Series exhibition games against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.\n\nOver the course of six MLB seasons, Irabu's career totals are 126 games, 514 innings, 34 wins, 35 losses, 16 saves, 405 strikeouts, and a 5.15 ERA. His Japanese totals for eleven seasons are 273 games, 1,286 innings, 72 wins, 69 losses, 11 saves, 1,282 strikeouts, and a 3.55 ERA.\n\nIn April 2009, Irabu had come out of retirement and made a contract with Long Beach Armada of the independent Golden Baseball League. He posted a 5–3 record in 10 starts, with an ERA of 3.58. In 65 innings Irabu struck out 66 batters while walking just 19. In August, he announced his intention to return to the Japanese professional leagues, and began playing for the semi-professional Kōchi Fighting Dogs.\n\nOn August 20, 2008, Irabu was arrested on the suspicion of assaulting the manager of a bar in Umeda, Osaka. He was upset that his credit card was not accepted in the bar. At the time of the suspected assault, Irabu had consumed at least 20 glasses of beer. Irabu admitted to the assault, the bartender sustained no injuries, and Irabu paid the bill with another credit card.\n\nIrabu was arrested for DUI on May 17, 2010, in Redondo Beach, California. The press release of his arrest stated he resided at the time in Rancho Palos Verdes.\n\nIrabu was found dead in his home in Los Angeles on July 27, 2011. He was reported to have hanged himself. He left behind his wife and two children. Irabu's autopsy showed he was inebriated at the time of his death with both alcohol and Ativan in his system. He was reportedly despondent because his wife had taken their two daughters and left him.\n\n"}
{"id": "1993584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993584", "title": "History of the Catskill Mountains", "text": "History of the Catskill Mountains\n\nThe Catskills began existence as a river delta 350 million years ago. Streams flowing off the then-mighty Acadian Mountains deposited sediment where the river met a sea (now the Allegheny Plateau. Eventually the Taconics eroded to their present size and the waters dried up, leaving a mostly flat plain.\n\nDuring this time period, a meteor is believed to have struck the area. Panther Mountain is the remains of its crater.\n\nTwo hundred million years ago, as continental drift pushed up the Appalachians, the delta region rose almost uniformly into a plateau rather than breaking up into smaller mountains. Streams that formed over time eroded gaps and valleys, leaving today's \"mountains.\"\n\nThe next great change in the Catskill landscape was caused by the most recent of four periods of glaciation, the Wisconsin. Every mountain except Slide (and perhaps West Kill) was covered. The glaciers left behind lakes when they melted, some of which became reservoirs in the 20th century.\n\nSome geologists also believe the glaciers scoured off sedimentary layers that may have contained coal, noting the surfeit of coal to the south in Pennsylvania and that the white quartz pebbles found atop Slide Mountain are often an indicator that one has reached the bottom of a coal bed in those regions.\n\nWhile the matter has yet to be fully researched, there seems to have been no large-scale long-term Native American presence in the mountains. The local Mohican and Munsee tribes used land and water routes through the mountains to get to the places beyond them, hunted the abundant game and used the mountains in some of their rituals, but in general chose not to live there due to the difficulty of farming the land.\n\nRobert Juet, one of Henry Hudson's crew, was the first European to take note of the Catskills on the \"Half Moon\"'s 1609 expedition up the river. Some hardy pioneers, explorers and traders followed over the next several decades, leaving their imprint on the region in placenames, but generally not settling the region to a significantly greater extent than the Indians did.\n\nIn 1667, as a result of the Treaty of Breda which ended the Second Anglo-Dutch War, England's wartime victory was ratified and the British crown took over colonial administration of what was now New York.\n\nOver the next several decades, regular rumors of gold strikes drew more settlers to the region, though none has ever been found. Trade in beaver hats spurred more exploration and settlement of the region.\n\nThe most important event in the history of the colonial Catskills took place in the first decade of the 18th century during Queen Anne's War. In 1706 an ambitious speculator, major Johannes Hardenbergh, and his partner, Jacob Rutsen, petitioned the governor, Edward, Viscount Cornbury, for a land grant in the mountains of Ulster County, attempting to head off another petition by a group of Hurley farmers who wanted pasture in the area yet had not properly purchased the land from the local Indian tribes as the law required.\n\nThe lack of a good survey of the area complicated matters somewhat. After years of arguing, haggling and taking advantage of Cornbury's loose ethics, the Patent was granted on April 20, 1708.\n\nSince they had applied as a corporation, Hardenbergh and Rutsen were exempt from laws limiting any such grant to 2,000 acres (8 km²). Yet they wound up, through what some say was a mistake, with title to a thousand times that land, or practically the entire Catskill region as we know it today, in the form of a rough triangle that started west of Kingston and extended, at least on paper, to the west branch of the Delaware.\n\nSettlement was impeded for the next thirty years due to the lack of a survey. Hardenbergh, however, managed to enrich himself by selling shares in the partnership, much to the consternation of colonial governors who wanted a firmer bulwark against French ambitions in North America. There had been no good survey, and no one knew where the boundaries of the patent lay, much less any subdivisions. Indian tribes upset that rivals had sold their land out from under them and squatters who had moved into the area before sabotaged the Wooster brothers' attempts at a first real survey of the region in the 1740s.\n\nIn his later years Hardenbergh was helped greatly by Robert Livingston, who saw the region's economic potential and would acquire of the Hardenbergh Patent. By the time of Hardenbergh's death in 1745 settlement was at last beginning to get underway. Five years later, when the entire Patent was subdivided and accounted for, the Hardenbergh land company was dissolved.\n\nThe unclear early history of land ownership in the days of the Patent, however, would impact the region for generations to come.\n\nIn 1753 the early American naturalists John Bartram and his son William went to the Catskills as part of their explorations into the colonies' plant life, focusing particularly on the balsam fir, which was known among the colonists as balm of Gilead fir and believed by both them and the Indians to have curative powers. While their explorations were not extensive, the elder Bartram's short written account of the adventure, “A Journey to Ye Cat Skill Mountains with Billy,” was widely read and appreciated both in America and abroad. It is the first literary appreciation of the Catskills as a natural environment.\n\nThe Bartrams were the first to document the wide variety of tree species in the mountains. Officially, the trip was a failure as the balsam seeds they managed to collect failed to flourish in England. But in the course of collecting them they explored the area of the Pine Orchard near North and South Lakes on the Escarpment in Greene County, which would in the next century become the site of the Catskill Mountain House.\n\nRobert Livingston's son gradually took over managing his interest in the lands he had managed to acquire, and saw their future more in terms of the timber on them than the land itself. Drawing on the family's Scottish roots, he sought to rename them the Lothian Hills and envisioned a grand scheme in which castles named after originals in Scotland would be built on the mountaintops and sold to members of the European nobility who wished to have grand manors.\n\nThese plans were put on hold in 1769 when John Bradstreet, a British lieutenant colonel who had fought with distinction in the recent French and Indian War filed papers with the crown charging that the Hardenbergh Patent had been improperly granted and could thus be regranted; he claimed a 50,000 acre (200 km²) slice as was his right as a retired officer. Other officers joined in with additional, smaller claims.\n\nThe colonial governor, John Murray Dunmore, found in 1771 a solution that temporarily settled the issue but pleased no one: he awarded Bradstreet 20,000 acres (80 km²) in what is now Delaware County but said nothing about the legality of the original patent. Back in London the Privy Council urged King George III to block it, and he duly ordered the new governor, William Tryon, not to sign any grant for the land.\n\nBradstreet died in 1774, and his daughters were widely expected to take the fight to court, but very soon that took a backseat to other events.\n\nAs tensions increased between the colonies and Britain during the early 1770s over how to pay for the war, the Catskills saw this divide play out rather sharply. The large landowners like Livingston and the Hardenberghs, fearing Parliament would settle the matter with a land tax that would vastly cut into their wealth, increasingly took stands that would lead to independence. Their tenant farmers, on the other hand, were, as Livingston put it, \"resolved to stand by their King,\" despite their landlords' efforts to drum up revolutionary sentiment among them, in the belief that if it came down to war, the Crown would confiscate the holdings of those who had opposed it and distribute smaller parcels back to those who had been loyal.\n\nThis came to a head in 1777, when Lieutenant Jacob Rose raised an army of several hundred of the region's young men to go fight alongside the British in return for 50 acres (0.2 km²) each. Rose's Rangers, as they were called, had to make its way through the strongly Patriot Hudson Valley to rendezvous with British regulars in New York City, however, and was captured in the vicinity of Schunemunk Mountain in Orange County after a skirmish with local militia. Prisoners were taken to Fort Montgomery and tried for treason against the recently established state of New York. Most were pardoned in exchange for committing to serve in the Continental Army; Rose and a few other holdouts were hanged.\n\nThe failure of Rose's mission and the burning of Kingston by British forces that year severely blunted Tory sentiment in the Catskills, and for the remainder of the war the region posed no threat to the Patriot cause.\n\nThe Catskills became a major resort destination for Jewish New Yorkers in the mid-20th century. Borscht Belt is an informal term for the summer resorts of the Catskill Mountains in Sullivan and Ulster counties in upstate New York which were frequented by Ashkenazic Jews. Changes in vacationing patterns have led most of those travelers elsewhere, although there are still bungalow communities in the towns of Liberty, Bethel, Thompson and Fallsburg catering to Orthodox populations. The term, which derives from the name of a beet soup popular with people of Eastern European origin, can also refer to the Catskill region itself.\n\nIn August, 1969, the Catskills were the site of a music and art festival in the town of Bethel, which had originally been planned for Woodstock, New York. Thirty-three of the best-known musicians of the era appeared during a sometimes rainy weekend in front of nearly half a million concertgoers. The event, featuring liberal drug use and nudity, exemplified the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n"}

Composed of Christy Dignam, Joe Jewell, Billy McGuinness, Alan Downey, Rodney O'Brien and Sean Kelly(harmonica), the band has released six studio albums: \"Feel No Shame\" (1988), \"Goodbye Charlie Moonhead\" (1994), \"Here Comes Lucy Jones\" (1997), \"Waiting For This Madness To End\" (2001), \"For Some Strange Reason\" (2007) and \"Nudie Books and Frenchies\" (2012).\n\nAslan took their name from the fictional lion in C.S. Lewis's series of books chronicling the land of Narnia (Aslan is the Turkish word for \"Lion\"). The band came from the working class areas of Finglas and Ballymun in Dublin's Northside, in the mid-1980s. They released a demo single, \"This Is\", in the spring of 1986. It was a success and a popular single on Ireland's pop radio station, RTÉ 2fm.\n\nIn the summer of 1986, they played a series of shows in the UK and \"Melody Maker\" noted: \"Lucky the label that signs this band!\" Janice Long at BBC Radio 1 recorded Aslan in session and it aired three times in the subsequent weeks. At the end of 1986, Aslan were awarded The Stag/\"Hot Press\" \"Most Promising New Band\" award and signed to EMI.\n\nIn 1988, they recorded their debut album, \"Feel No Shame\", which went to number one on the Irish Albums Chart. Within a couple of months it was certified Gold. However, in August 1988 after the option for their second album had been picked up, Aslan split up. The band recruited Eamo Doyle previously with Dublin band The Lookalikes as lead singer, but as drummer Alan said on the \"Made In Dublin\" DVD that \"it was like U2 trying to go on without Bono...it was just never going to work\". Eamo Doyle went on to play with Les Binks from Judas Priest. The ex-lead singer, Christy, went on to form Dignam & Goff with guitarist Conor Goff and other members went on to form another band, The Precious Stones.\n\nOn 11 July 1993, Aslan played what was planned as a one-time charity performance in Finglas. Rather, they decided to reunite and Aslan landed a new record deal with BMG. The first single \"Crazy World\" entered the Irish Singles Chart at number four and stayed in the chart for three months. \"Crazy World\" also won the \"Single of the Year\" at 1993's \"Hot Press\" Awards. A few months later the follow-up single, \"Where's The Sun\", reached number three on the chart.\n\nThe latter part of 1994 was spent touring in Ireland and recording their album \"Goodbye Charlie Moonhead\", which was released in Ireland at the end of 1994 and charted at number one, going on to be certified Gold weeks later. But by 1995, the band were dropped by their record label BMG.\n\nIn April 1996, Aslan began recording a new album without a record label. This album, \"Here Comes Lucy Jones\" was released in October 1997 and the album went into the Irish Albums Chart at number fourteen. Aslan were nominated in seven categories of the 1997 \"Hot Press\" readers poll.\n\n\"Shame About Lucy Moonhead\", a compilation of the best of Aslan's recorded work on EMI, was released in July 1998. It reached number one in the albums chart and was later certified double platinum.\n\nIn March 1999, Aslan played five sell-out shows at Ireland's Vicar Street venue, during which their live album and video concert movie/DVD \"Made In Dublin\" were recorded. Both reached number one in their first week of release. The album went platinum within three weeks and remained in the top ten for eight weeks. Towards the end of 1999 Aslan sold out Ireland's largest indoor venue (9,000 capacity), the Point Theatre on 26 December, sharing the billing with Picture House.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Aslan toured Australia for the first time to promote the release of the album \"Shame About Lucy Moonhead\" and sold-out shows in Sydney and Melbourne. Aslan ended 2000 by playing for the first time in the Netherlands to a sellout crowd. Afterwards, they returned to Ireland to sell out the Point Theatre on 27 December.\n\nIn early 2001, Aslan recorded a single, \"She's So Beautiful\" (featuring Sinéad O'Connor on backing vocals), which entered the Irish Singles Chart at number nine on the week ending 26 July 2001 and peaked at number eight the following week. The band released the follow-up \"Different Man\", which charted at number seven. In September 2001, Aslan's studio album, \"Waiting for This Madness to End\" entered the Irish Album Chart at number one, and reached platinum sales certification after only four weeks. During Christmas 2001, Aslan again sold out the 9,000 capacity Point Theatre. In 2002 Aslan were nominated for eight categories in the \"Hot Press\" readers' poll.\n\nIn October 2005, the band released a 48-track CD, named \"Platinum\". The album contains the singles, b-sides and rarities of their career. The Platinum collection went into the charts at number three and after several weeks achieved platinum sales. The band played yet another headlining gig at the Point Theatre on 27 December 2005.\n\nThe band helped write and perform \"How Can I Protect You\", the tenth track for Alabama 3 on their 2006 album, \"Outlaw\".\n\nTheir next album, \"For Some Strange Reason\", was released in October 2007 and debuted at number eight in the Irish Albums Chart. This was their first album based solely on new material not to debut in top spot since 1997's \"Here Comes Lucy Jones\". Two singles, \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Jealous Little Thing\" were released prior to the album. Singer Damien Dempsey makes an appearance on the new album on the track \"Bullets and Diamonds\".\n\nOn 15 February 2008, Aslan won the award for Best Irish Band at the 2008 Meteor Awards. Soon afterwards, Tony McGuinness announced on the band's website that he would be moving to Australia for one year with his family, and would be replaced by Rodney O'Brien as bass player for Aslan during that time. On 7 November 2008, Aslan performed \"Always\" on a Balcony overlooking Dame Street, in Dublin for the music viral show \"BalconyTV\".\n\nIn May 2009, Aslan released \"Uncased\" and reached number two in the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nThe band toured Australia in December 2011 playing to large crowds of predominantly expatriates.\n\nTheir album \"Nudie Books and Frenchies\" was released in April 2012 and reached number one in the Irish Albums Chart.\n\nAslan released their next single \"Secret Smile\" on 10 July 2015. They also released their single \"Now I Know\" in 2018, with a 30th anniversary version of \"Feel No Shame\" on vinyl and CD.\n\nIn early 2019, they released a 25th anniversary edition of \"Goodbye Charlie Moonhead\" on vinyl, excluding the track \"Maybe I’m Obsessed\".\n\nCurrent\n\nFormer\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1993641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993641", "title": "Andreas Hammerschmidt", "text": "Andreas Hammerschmidt\n\nAndreas Hammerschmidt (1611 or 1612 – 29 October 1675), the \"Orpheus of Zittau,\" was a German Bohemian composer and organist of the early to middle Baroque era. He was one of the most significant and popular composers of sacred music in Germany in the middle 17th century.\n\nHe was born at Brüx, a small Protestant community in Bohemia, to a Saxon father and a Bohemian mother. In 1626 the family had to flee Bohemia, during the Thirty Years' War, after it had become Catholic; they settled in Freiberg, Saxony, where Andreas must have received his musical education. He probably did not study with composer Christoph Demantius, who was \"Kantor\" at Freiberg and the most significant musician in the city while Hammerschmidt was there; however he may have known him. Many famous musicians of the early Baroque spent time in Freiberg but it is uncertain which of them taught Hammerschmidt; at any rate he received a superb musical training while there.\n\nHammerschmidt left Freiberg in 1633, through his mentor Stephan Otto, taking a post as organist for Count Rudolf von Bünau in Weesenstein, but returned to Freiberg the next year as an organist. He was married shortly after his return there, and of his six children three died in infancy. In 1639 he left Freiberg again, moving to Zittau, where he succeeded Christoph Schreiber as organist; he remained in Zittau at this post for the rest of his life. While musical life in Zittau was severely damaged by the Thirty Years' War, including the decimation of the choirs and general reduction in musical standards, Hammerschmidt survived; after the end of the war in 1648 musical life slowly regained its former high standard.\nExact records of his activities in Zittau are spotty, for the documents were burned in 1757 when the city was destroyed by the Austrians in the Seven Years' War; however Hammerschmidt during this portion of his career became one of the best-known composers in Germany, and the most famous representative of the concertato style of the generation after Heinrich Schütz. While well-respected and called on as an expert in many matters, he seems to have been prone to outbursts of rage, some of which involved him in brawls. He also seems to have profited well from his activities as a musician and civic leader, and evidently lived in some luxury, having a house in town as well as a country estate.\n\nHammerschmidt wrote motets, concertos and arias, and almost all of his output is sacred vocal music in the concertato style. According to Manfred Bukofzer (1947), he \"watered down the achievements of Schütz for the multitude.\" Many of his compositions are in the form of the chorale monody, an adaptation of the early Baroque Italian form to a sacred, and specifically Protestant, purpose. Indeed, Hammerschmidt represents the second generation of composers who distilled a native German Baroque tradition out of forms and styles imported from Italy.\n\nOver 400 works by Hammerschmidt survive, in a total of 14 separate collections. The motets represent a more conservative style, as noted by Hammerschmidt himself, and the concertos—concertato pieces with opposing groups of voices and instruments—are in a current idiom.\n\nSome of his concertos are written for large ensembles, with diverse combinations of instruments and voices (for example, the sets from \"Gespräche über die Evangelia\" of 1655–1656; this was long enough after the war that large ensembles were available again). He wrote these pieces for Sundays and church feast days; their structure and intent foreshadowed the later German church cantata, as exemplified most famously by Johann Sebastian Bach. Even Hammerschmidt's masses conform to the concertato style, and are best seen as concertos.\n\nWhile Hammerschmidt was an organist all of his life, no organ music of his has survived; indeed there is no evidence he published any. Some instrumental music of his has survived in three publications; most of these are suites of dances influenced by the English style which was prevalent in the northern part of Germany at that time.\n\n\n\n"}

JP-7 is the fuel that was developed, which was required by the Pratt & Whitney J58 (JT11D-20) turbojet engine, which was used primarily in the now retired Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. During flight, the SR-71 could attain speeds in excess of Mach 3+, which was the most efficient cruising speed for the J58 engines. However, very high skin temperatures are generated at this speed due to friction with the air. A new jet fuel was needed that was not affected by the heat, so JP-7 jet fuel was developed for this purpose.\n\nThe Boeing X-51 Waverider also uses JP-7 fuel to run the Pratt & Whitney SJY61 scramjet engine, with fuel capacity of some . As with the SR-71, the X-51A design super-cools this fuel (cooled by extended subsonic flight in the stratosphere; prior to acceleration to supersonic speeds); then, when in supersonic flight, the fuel is heated by its circulation through heat exchangers which transfer to it the heat load of the interior spaces of the airframe. The fuel is then pumped through rotating mechanical parts of the engines and auxiliary mechanical equipment, providing both lubrication and cooling. Finally, at a temperature of nearly , it is pumped into the fuel nozzles of the engines.\n\nJP-7 is a compound mixture composed primarily of hydrocarbons; including alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkylbenzenes, indanes/tetralins, and naphthalenes; with addition of fluorocarbons to increase its lubricant properties, an oxidizing agent to make it burn more efficiently, and a caesium-containing compound known as A-50, which is to aid in disguising the radar and infrared signatures of the exhaust plume. The SR-71 Blackbirds used approximately of fuel per hour of flight.\n\nJP-7 is unusual in that it is not a conventional distillate fuel, but is created from special blending stocks in order to have very low (<3%) concentration of highly volatile components like benzene or toluene, and almost no sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen impurities. It has a low vapor pressure, and high thermal oxidation stability. The fuel must operate across a wide range of temperatures: from near freezing at high altitude, to the high temperatures of the airframe and engine parts that are being cooled by it at high speed. Its volatility must be low enough to make it flash-resistant at these high temperatures.\n\nThe very low volatility, and relative unwillingness of JP-7 to be ignited, required triethylborane (TEB) to be injected into the engine in order to initiate combustion, and allow afterburner operation in flight. The SR-71 had a limited capacity for TEB, and therefore had a limited number of available 'shots' of TEB (usually 16) for re-starts, and those had to be managed carefully on long-duration flights with multiple stages of relatively low-altitude air refueling and normal high-altitude cruise flight.\n\nShell Oil developed JP-7 in 1955. Company vice president Jimmy Doolittle arranged for Shell to develop the fuel for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and United States Air Force's (USAF) secret Lockheed U-2 spy plane, which needed a low-volatility fuel that would not evaporate at high altitude. Manufacturing several hundred thousand gallons of the new fuel required the petroleum byproducts Shell normally used to make its Flit insecticide, causing a nationwide shortage of that product that year.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The memoir describes her experiences of being raped and how the experience shaped the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1981, 17-year-old Alice Sebold was living in Syracuse, New York. Sebold was finishing her freshman year at Syracuse University when she was attacked, beaten, and raped while walking home through a park off campus in the early morning hours of May 8. She reported the crime to the police, who remarked that a young woman had once been murdered in the same location. Thus, they told her, she was \"lucky.\"\n\nSebold returned home to Pennsylvania to live with her family for the summer before beginning her sophomore year at Syracuse. After months of no leads by the police, Sebold spotted her rapist while walking down the sidewalk. He smirked at her and remarked that he knew her \"from somewhere\" before continuing on. She called the police, who apprehended him.\n\nAmong her professors at the time was Tess Gallagher, who became one of Sebold's confidantes. Gallagher accompanied Sebold to several legal proceedings. Also among her professors were Raymond Carver, Tobias Wolff and Hayden Carruth.\n\nDuring a lineup, Sebold failed to correctly identify her assailant, as he had brought a friend with him who looked very similar in order to confuse and presumably intimidate Sebold. Finally, he was arrested again and tried for her rape. After he was convicted, Sebold's off-campus apartment was broken into and her roommate was raped and Sebold was forced to relive her own trauma. Though no connection to Sebold's rape case was ever proven, she felt that it was retaliation for her rapist being locked up. Her roommate looked at a photo lineup but ultimately decided not to pursue any further legal action.\n\nSebold has stated that her reason for writing the book was to bring more awareness to rape. \"One of the reasons why I wrote it is because tons of people have had similar stories, not exactly the same but similar, and I want the word 'rape' to be used easily in conversation. My desire would be that somehow my writing would take a little bit of the taboo or the weirdness of using that word away.

He was named by Chinese historians as one of the four greatest generals of the Warring States period, along with Bai Qi, Wang Jian and Li Mu.\n\nIn Lian Po's early years, he had victories in the wars against Qi and Wei. Lin Xiangru, a minister of Zhao, was disliked by Lian Po, because of his rapid rise to power and genius. But Lin Xiangru, in several famous incidents, took great steps to avoid Lian Po; in one case he even turned from Lian Po's carriage rather than block the great general's route. Eventually, all this began to cause shame and embarrassment to Lian Po, and he carried sharp brambles on his shoulder without clothing and asked Lin Xiangru to forgive him. Afterwards, they became good friends.\n\nDuring the Battle of Changping, he became the commander of Zhao. Deciding not to risk his forces by engaging in open battle with the Qin, under their brilliant general Bai Qi, Lian Po instead built a series of forts along the Changping area, successfully stopping the invasion of Qin. However, King Xiaocheng of Zhao (趙孝成王), under the persuasion of many courtiers (most of whom were bribed heavily by Qin spies) became dissatisfied with Lian Po's strategy, and decided to replace him with Zhao Kuo (趙括). Being the son of another famous Zhao general, Zhao She, Zhao Kuo discarded Lian Po's cautious, defensive strategy and attacked with full strength. As a consequence, he was defeated, and Zhao never returned to prominence.\n\nAfter the Battle of Changping, Lian Po became the commander of Zhao army again to stop the invasion of Yan. He defeated Yan army, but in his later years, he was distrusted by the King of Zhao. Therefore, he decided to escape to Wei, and then to Chu.\n\nHe died in Shouchun, the capital of the Chu state, living long enough to see the gradual demise of the country he once served.\n\nIn the Manga and Anime Kingdom, he was shown as a cheerful, but often serious General. He was surrounded by 4 of his best men in battle. He left Zhao after he disagreed with King Daoxiang's method of leadership. He went to Wei, joined battle against Qin, but lost after the puppet leader died. He left Wei, and settled in Shouchun, in Chu. There, he was a \"guest\" in the Chu estate.

{"id": "1993671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993671", "title": "AGIL paradigm", "text": "AGIL paradigm\n\nThe AGIL paradigm is a sociological scheme created by American sociologist Talcott Parsons in the 1950s. It is a systematic depiction of certain societal functions, which every society must meet to be able to maintain stable social life. The AGIL paradigm is part of Parsons's larger action theory, outlined in his notable book \"The Structure of Social Action\", in \"The Social System\" and in later works, which aims to construct a unified map of all action systems, and ultimately \"living systems\". Indeed, the actual AGIL system only appeared in its first elaborate form in 1956, and Parsons extended the system in various layers of complexity during the rest of his intellectual life. Towards the end of his life, he added a new dimension to the action system, which he called the paradigm of the human condition; within that paradigm, the action system occupied the integral dimension.\n\nParsons' theory is a part of the paradigm of action theory. AGIL represents the functional scheme for the whole general action system (including the human condition paradigm), so that AGIL also defines the cultural system, the personality system etc. The social system represent the integral part of the action system and is in this way only a subsystem within the greater whole of systems. For example the order of the cultural system vis-a-vis the AGIL functional scheme is:\n\nA: Cognitive symbolization.\nG: Expressive symbolization.\nI: Moral-evaluative symbolization.\nL: Constitutive symbolization.\n\nSociety, in this paradigm, is defined as prototypical category of the social system, that meets the essential functional prerequisites that define the system's universal attributes. AGIL scheme outlines four systematic, core functions, that are prerequisites for any society to be able to persist over time. It is a misconception that the system functions are \"institutions,\" they exist on a much higher level of theoretical comprehension than institutions yet each system is inhabited by institutions. Institutions have either universal implications or historical implications depending on their form, nature and specification. The system shapes the \"nature\" of its institutions—so that the political system is the orbit of \"political institutions.\" The stock-market is common-sensically not regarded as a political institution yet the stock-market might have political functions (which is a different analytical issue).\n\nAGIL is an acronym from the initials of each of the four systemic necessities. The AGIL system is considered a cybernetic hierarchy and has generally the following order L-I-G-A, when the order is viewed from an \"informational\" point of view; this implies that the L function could \"control\" or define the I function (and the I the G and so on) approximately in the way in which a computer-game-program \"defines\" the game. The program does not \"determine\" the game (which actual outcome would depend on the input of the player, that was what Parsons in a sense called the voluntaristic aspect of action) but it \"determined\" the logical parameter of the game, which lies implicit in the game's concrete design and rules. In this way, Parsons would say that culture would not determine the social system but it would \"define it.\" The AGIL system had also an energy side (or a \"conditional\" side), which would go A-G-I-L. So that the Adaptive level would be on the highest level of the cybernetic hierarchy from the energy or \"conditional\" point of view. However, within these two reverse sequences of the hierarchy Parsons maintained that in the long historical perspective, a system which was high in information (that is, a system that followed the L-I-G-A sequence) would tend to prevail over system which was high in energy. For example in the human body, the DNA is the informational code which will tend to control \"the body\" which is high in energy. Within the action system, Parsons would maintain that it was culture which was highest in information and which in his way was in cybernetic control over other components of the action system, as well as the social system. However, it is important to maintain that all action systems (including social systems) are always depending on the (historically specific) equilibrium of the overall forces of information and condition, which both shape the outcome of the system. Also it is important to highlight that the AGIL system does not \"guarantee\" any historical system survival; they rather specify the minimum conditions for whether societies or action systems in principle can survive. Whether a concrete action system survive or not is a sheer historical question.\n\n\nThese four functions aim to be intuitive. For example a tribal system of hunter-gatherers needs to gather food from the external world by hunting animals and gathering other goods. They need to have a set of goals and a system to make decisions about such things as when to migrate to better hunting grounds. The tribe also needs to have a common belief system that enforces actions and decisions as the community sees fit. Finally there needs to be some kind of educational system to pass on hunting and gathering skills and the common belief system. If these prerequisites are met, the tribe can sustain its existence.\n\nThe four functions of AGIL break into external and internal problems, and further into instrumental and consummatory problems. External problems include the use of natural resources and making decisions to achieve goals, whereas keeping the community integrated and maintaining the common values and practices over succeeding generations are considered internal problems. Furthermore, goal attainment and the integral function belong to the consummatory aspect of the systems.\n\nIt is common to use a table to illustrate the four functions and their differences in spatial and temporal orientation. (The following only addresses the AGIL component examples for the social system—for example, \"political office\" is not a unit for the categories on the action-system level).\n\nEach of the four individual functional necessities are further divided into four sub-categories. The four sub-categories are the same four functions as the major four AGIL categories and so on. Hence one subsystem of the societal community is the category of \"citizenship,\" which is a category we today would associate with the concept of civil society. In this way, citizenship (or civil society) represents according to Parsons, the goal-attainment function within the subsystem of the Societal Community. For example, a community's adaption to the economic environment might consist of the basic \"industrial\" process of production (adaption), political-strategic goals for production (goal-attainment), the interaction between the economical system and the societal community, which integrates production mechanisms both in regard to economic as well as societal factors (integration), and common cultural values in their \"selective\" relevance for the societal-economic interchange process (latency (or Pattern Maintenance)). Each of these systemic processes will (within the scope of the cybernetic hierarchy) be regulated by what Talcott Parsons calls generalized symbolic media. Each system level of the general action-paradigm has each their set of generalized symbolic media (so that the set of generalized symbolic media for the social system is not identical with those of the action system or those of the human condition paradigm). In regard to the social system, there are the following four generalized symbolic media:\n\nA: (Economy): Money. G: (Political system): Political power. I: (Societal Community): Influence. L: (Judiciary system): Value-commitment.\n\nParsons' theory has been criticised as being too abstract to be used constructively in any significant empirical research. While the four functions of the AGIL scheme are intuitive and many social systems can be described according to the paradigm of Parsons' structural functionalism, one can question the utility that such an inspection brings to a scientific sociological study. Defenders of the AGIL scheme respond that there have indeed been situations where social systems, such as some industries, have failed to operate because they have neglected one or more of the four functions. Hence, the AGIL scheme can be tested against political or economical systems in operation to see if they meet the criteria. Defenders also highlight that all theoretical systems are abstract (indeed modern physics uses extremely high levels of theoretical abstractions (without anyone \"protesting\")). Any good theoretical system has to be abstract, since this is the meaning and function of theoretical systems. \nAnother notable criticism attacks the AGIL schemes' failure to take historical change into account. Critics argue that Parsons' theory is inexcusably static and lacks the flexibility to meet instances of social change. While Parsons purports that the AGIL scheme is a general theory of social functions that can be applied to any social system at any time or place in the history of humankind, critics contend that it is basically just a model of the post-war United States, or, moreover, merely an ideal social structure of the middle-class of United States. Parsons' defenders argue that such criticisms are misplaced inasmuch as Parsons tried to identify the most important systemic features of any society whatsoever: \"any\" society would need to meet the functions indicated by AGIL, even if it used different institutions or arrangements for doing so. Moreover, Parsons himself tried to develop a theory of world history, and to explain social change through his system, although his critics have suggested that this amounts to little more than window-dressing. Nevertheless, despite recent sympathetic reappraisals, Parsons no longer dominates Anglophone social theory in the way he once did.\n\n\n\n"}

The name of the ensemble comes from an imaginary radio station in Tarifa, a small town in the Spanish province of Cadiz, Andalusia, the closest part of Spain to Morocco. Instead of simply fusing musical styles as they are currently known, Radio Tarifa went back in time to the common past of those styles, before the final conquest of Granada in 1492, when the Moors and Jews were exiled from Spain. This invented style sheds light upon the real styles of Spain, most notably flamenco, although the band rejected all musical purism, preferring to mix arrangements of traditional compositions with their own melodies and combining instruments from Ancient Egypt, classical Greek and Roman times with modern saxophones and electric bass.\n\nBoth Fain Dueñas (percussion, Spain) and Vincent Molino (flute, France) were students of Moroccan multi-instrumentalist and composer Tarik Banzi of the Al-Andalus Ensemble.

The album was a departure for Dylan, who uses a large pop-rock band including female backing vocalists.\n\nBefore work began on \"Street-Legal\", Dylan's personal life underwent a major change. In February 1977, Dylan spent several days at Gold Star Studios where Leonard Cohen was recording a new album, \"Death of a Ladies' Man\", with Phil Spector and Allen Ginsberg. After one session where Dylan and others indulged in a substantial amount of alcohol, Dylan returned to his Malibu home with an old friend of Cohen's, a woman named Malka. According to a declaration by Sara Dylan's legal representative (publicly released in March 1977), \"On February 22nd...[Sara] came down to breakfast and found Dylan, the children, and a woman named Malka at the breakfast table. She said that it was then that Dylan struck her on the face and ordered her to leave.\" It's unclear whether this statement is true; any additional context or information was sealed by Judge Raffedie. (Judge Raffedie also sealed Dylan's response to his ex-wife's allegations; the order was given before Dylan's response was filed.) The divorce was quickly settled, becoming final in June 1977, with apparently little effort at reconciliation. Sara would receive initial custody of the children.\n\nIn the meantime, Dylan was still editing \"Renaldo and Clara\", an ill-fated film that was shot during the fall of 1975, when Dylan was on the first leg of a tour with the now-defunct Rolling Thunder Revue. With the summer approaching, Dylan took a break from the film and returned to his farm in Minnesota, where he was accompanied by his children and Faridi McFree, with whom Dylan had started a relationship. There he began writing a new set of songs, including \"Changing of the Guards,\" \"No Time to Think,\" and \"Where Are You Tonight?\" At least six of the nine songs ultimately included on \"Street-Legal\" were written during this time.\n\nHis work was disrupted on August 16, 1977 when news broke that Elvis Presley had died at 3:30 p.m. at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. \"I went over my whole life,\" recalled Dylan. \"I went over my whole childhood. I didn't talk to anyone for a week.\"\n\nLater that fall, another custody battle emerged when Sara sought permission from the court to move to Hawaii with the children. It was a major distraction at the time, as Dylan was planning a world tour, his first in twelve years, and the stage was already set when Dylan signed a five-year lease to an old three-story building on the corner of Ocean and Main in Santa Monica, California. Dubbed 'Rundown,' the building was soon converted into a rehearsal space and studio, and by September, he had already staffed it with Joel Bernstein and Arthur Rosato, two engineers who were originally part of Dylan's road crew in 1976.\n\nBefore rehearsals could begin, Dylan had to assemble a band, and he quickly contacted several musicians, including former Rolling Thunder Revue members Steve Soles, David Mansfield, Rob Stoner, and Howie Wyeth. Stoner recalls, \"I thought the \"Hard Rain\" thing was the last I'd ever hear from Bob...Then suddenly I get this call - I think Bob called me up personally...and asked me to bring Howie, and a couple of other people, to L.A. to 'just try some things out.'\"\n\nSoles, Mansfield, Stoner, Wyeth, pianist Walter Davis, Jr., and percussionist Otis Smith arrived in late November and early December. Even with the players assembled, Dylan was not ready to rehearse as the custody battle over his children and the imminent release of \"Renaldo and Clara\" drew most of his attention. (He was still editing \"Renaldo and Clara\" up to the very last minute.) \"Bob kept us sitting around for a week or two,\" recalls Stoner. \"He just never showed up...and [when he finally] drops in, he's distracted...He was really [stressed out]. He was always bummed out. He was chain-smoking and he was really in a bad mood. He was short with people. It just wasn't working out.\"\n\nEventually, a settlement in his custody battle was reached in late December, ensuring that his children would remain in California where Dylan would have access to them. Fallout from the custody battle would keep Dylan and Sara from reaching amicable terms for several years. Meanwhile, \"Renaldo and Clara\" was released to some of the worst reviews of Dylan's career. The negative reaction clearly irritated Dylan, but with the film finally released and his legal matters settled, Dylan was ready to rehearse.\n\nSessions soon began in earnest, but on December 26, Dylan followed the day's rehearsals with a preview of his next album; playing just the piano, Dylan ran down his new batch of songs to Stoner, Soles, and Bernstein, many of which were written that summer at his farm in Minnesota. As rehearsals got underway, it became clear that they weren't \"picking up where the Rolling Thunder Revue left off,\" recalls Mansfield. \"I brought my steel guitar and I had it in rehearsal and every time I'd go to start unpacking it, Bob would go, 'We don't need that.' All of a sudden the instrument that I played all over the place in the previous band, he didn't want to see it, let alone hear it.\"\n\nOne component from the Rolling Thunder Revue left by his own choice. Howie Wyeth was struggling with his own heroin addiction at the time, recalling, \"I knew I couldn't get high once we'd left...I realized I was either gonna get busted or I'd end up being tortured to death. So I literally had to just tell Bob one night, 'I can't do it.' That was terrible. He had his own problems. He felt bad that I wasn't gonna do it, and he called me up when I got home to New York and said, 'Are you sure?'\"\n\nAfter auditioning a number of drummers (\"maybe ten or a dozen\" by Bernstein's estimates), Dylan replaced Wyeth with Denny Seiwell, who briefly played with Paul McCartney and Wings.\n\nWhen rehearsal was held on December 30, the band now included Stoner, Mansfield, Soles, guitarist Jesse Ed Davis, and singers Katey Sagal, Debbie Dye Gibson, and Frannie Eisenberg. This rehearsal was mostly dedicated to rearrangements of classic Dylan compositions, many of which drew heavily on the adult-contemporary pop of the time (Wayne Newton, Barry Manilow, Marvin Hamlisch). As biographer Clinton Heylin writes, \"[Dylan] began to impose a grander vision on whatever sound the Revue veterans had initially conceived. With his love of fatback R&B, it should have come as no surprise that he hankered after a band with a saxophone player and some female singers...the band he assembled in the two months before the 1978 world tour shares many similarities with the big band he had attempted to impose on \"Desire\". The girls/sax/keyboards combination also reflected elements of the extravagantly presented shows Presley had been playing in the 1970's.\"\n\nBy mid-January 1978, Dylan was still unsatisfied with some aspects of the band, and with the first leg of his world tour set for February in Japan, he quickly made some last-minute changes, removing Sagal and Eisenberg and replacing them with novice singer Helena Springs and seasoned professional Jo Ann Harris. (Sagal was not surprised by her dismissal. \"I remember...he'd have three girls all sing a part that was not in our range,\" Sagal recalls, \"and we were too terrified to say anything.\")\n\nIn the meantime, Seiwell was let go; during his brief stint with Wings, he and the rest of Wings were busted for drug possession in Sweden, prompting Japanese officials to deny him an entry visa. A number of auditions were quickly arranged, and according to Stoner, they \"settled\" on former King Crimson drummer Ian Wallace. Though Wallace's drumming would become problematic (\"The man had a beat like a cop,\" recalls Stoner), time had run out as the tour was almost upon them. The Danish/American guitarist Billy Cross was also brought in, and eventually Dylan's touring band was solidified with Cross, Wallace, keyboardist Alan Pasqua, percussionist Bobbye Hall, and saxophonist Steve Douglas, Mansfield, Stoner, Soles, and the back-up singers.\n\nIn the final two weeks of rehearsals, Dylan began settling on new tour arrangements for his classic, earlier recordings. Rob Stoner recalls, \"a telegram arrived from the Japanese promoter, and in it he had a manifest of the songs he expected Bob to do on this tour. In other words he was a jukebox, he was playing requests. We don't want you coming here and doing like your new experimental material, or getting up there and jamming.\" As Heylin writes, \"though the \"idea\" of a big band had always appealed to Dylan, the reality was a whole series of new arrangements, to make each song different and to highlight the band's demonstrable versatility...Often these arrangement ideas came from the band. As Stoner observes, when they put these arrangements to Dylan, 'Sometimes he'd like it and he'd use it, and other times he'd say, Forget it.'\"\n\nThe band flew to Japan on February 16, 1978, and the tour drew considerable praise from the audience and press, in both Japan and Australia. Later documented on \"Bob Dylan At Budokan\", this tour was marked by bold, new arrangements of Dylan's classic recordings. During the course of these two-hour plus shows, Dylan often recast familiar songs in a more 'professional,' contemporary guise. However, some of the band members, including Stoner, were not entirely satisfied with Dylan's new sound. \"He had in mind to do something like Elvis Presley,\" recalls Stoner. \"That size band and the uniforms...he wasn't very sure about it, which is why he opened way out of town. I mean, we didn't go any place close to Europe or England or America [for] forever, man...and I don't blame him. I think he knew, subconsciously, he was making a big mistake.\"\n\nThe tour ended on April 1 at the Sydney Sportsground in Australia. When it was over, Stoner informed Dylan that he was leaving the band. Dylan was planning to record his next album upon returning to Los Angeles, but with Stoner gone, Dylan hired a new bass player, Jerry Scheff. Like Douglas, Scheff was a well-known player in Presley's touring band of the early 70's.\n\nWith Scheff replacing Stoner, Dylan began recording his new material with his touring band. Sessions were held at Rundown, with Dylan renting a mobile truck to record the proceedings. (The mobile truck was equipped with 24-track capabilities, something his studio did not have.) \"I didn't want to do it there,\" Dylan later recalled. \"[I] couldn't find the right producer, but it was necessary to do it. So we just brought in the remote truck and cut it, [and] went for a live sound.\" Dylan would ultimately settle on Don DeVito as his producer, even though he was dissatisfied with DeVito's work on \"Desire\".\n\nDylan already had a European tour scheduled for June, but he still had enough time to record his album; over the course of just four days, Dylan would record nine of his own compositions. Dylan knew exactly which songs he wanted to record, and though three songs written by Helena Springs were also recorded during these sessions (\"Coming from the Heart,\" \"Walk Out in the Rain,\" \"Stop Now\"), there is no indication that these songs were ever serious contenders for the album.\n\nThough the sessions lasted only four days, there were still a number of problems. The first being that it was recorded in a makeshift rehearsal space, and not a studio. \"The biggest problem...was how it was recorded,\" recalls Mansfield, \"with Bob getting impatient with the engineering assistants...baffling and checking levels and getting sounds in sync...and the recording crew just having to scramble to get mikes into place, and get something on tape, while we were playing the thing the few times we were gonna play it. It really was sort of like Bob Dylan meets Phil Spector in the best way...as if it had [just] been recorded so the instruments sounded full and well-blended.\"\n\nAs opposed to previous albums, the outtakes for \"Street-Legal\" are few in number. Only three additional songs were recorded for the album, of which none have seen release. There are two takes of \"Stop Now\", sounding very much like an additional \"Street-Legal\" song, in circulation. The Searchers would record \"Coming From The Heart (The Road Is Long)\" and Eric Clapton would release \"Walk Out In the Rain\" on his album Backless, which also included another song written at this time, \"If I Don't Be There By Morning.\"\n\n\nOther songs written during this time include:\n\nFollowing the twin successes of \"Blood on the Tracks\" and \"Desire\", \"Street-Legal\" was another gold record for Dylan, peaking at No. 11 on the U.S. Billboard charts, making it his first studio album to miss the U.S. Top 10 since 1964. However, it became his best-selling studio album in the UK, reaching No. 2 on the charts (his highest position in eight years) and achieving platinum status with 300,000 copies sold (the only other Dylan album to do this was \"The Essential Bob Dylan\").\n\nWhen \"Street-Legal\" was released, it was dismissed by the American press. \"Crawdaddy!\" critic Jon Pareles remarked that \"Dylan still needs a producer,\" but others found fault with both the songs and the performances. Greil Marcus criticized the singing as \"simply impossible to pay attention to for more than a couple of minutes at a time\" and accused \"Is Your Love in Vain?\" of sexism, claiming Dylan was \"speak[ing] to the woman like a sultan checking out a promising servant girl for VD.\"\n\nIn the UK, reviews were positive, with Michael Watts of \"Melody Maker\" proclaiming it Dylan's \"best album since \"John Wesley Harding\"\". \"NME\"'s Angus MacKinnon hailed it as Dylan's \"second major album of the 70s.\" In contrast to the record's still mixed reputation, Q Magazine has given the album a 5 star rating on re-release on two occasions, pointing out that the original muddiness of the production was part of the reason the record has so long been critically overlooked.\n\nWhen Dylan embarked on his European tour, he would be greeted by a generally warm audience reception, and his single, \"Baby, Stop Crying\" (the lyrics of which were allegedly inspired by Robert Johnson's \"Stop Breaking Down\"), would chart in the top ten throughout Europe, and reached number 13 on the UK Singles Chart with the album peaking at number 2 on the album chart. In the US, however, the single failed to crack the top 100 and the album itself peaked at number 11, ending Dylan's string of number 1 albums in America until 2006's \"Modern Times\". When Dylan continued his tour in America, it would be derided by the American press as the Alimony Tour and later the Vegas Tour, much to Dylan's chagrin.\n\nMany years later, even \"Street-Legal\"'s most ardent admirers would admit some flaws in the album, finding most fault with the production. \"\"Street-Legal\" would be the first in a long line of song collections whose failure to be realized in the studio would lay a 'dust of rumors' over Dylan as an abidingly creative artist that he has never been able to fully shake,\" writes Heylin.\n\nThe original 1978 LP sleeve credits mastering to Stan Kalina at CBS Recording Studios NY; the album was produced by Don DeVito. In 1999, DeVito revisited \"Street-Legal\" and remixed the album with modern, digital techniques in an attempt to improve the mix, producing a richer overall sound at the expense of Dylan's vocals. The remix was also used in a 2003 SACD reissue of \"Street-Legal\". However, in 2013, when \"Street-Legal\" was remastered as part of \"\", the original 1978 Kalina mix was reinstated.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1993708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993708", "title": "Bambiraptor", "text": "Bambiraptor\n\nBambiraptor is a Late Cretaceous, 72-million-year-old, bird-like dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur described by scientists at the University of Kansas, Yale University, and the University of New Orleans.\n\nThe holotype fossil is less than one meter long, although this specimen appears to be a juvenile, and it is possible that \"Bambiraptor\" is a juvenile \"Saurornitholestes\". Because of its small size, it was named \"Bambiraptor feinbergi\", after the popular Disney movie character (the name literally translates to \"Bambi thief\") and the surname of the wealthy family who bought and lent the specimen to the new Graves Museum of Natural History in Florida.\n\nThe \"Bambiraptor\" skeleton was discovered in 1993 by 14-year-old fossil hunter Wes Linster, who was looking for dinosaur bones with his parents near Glacier National Park in Montana, United States. Linster told \"Time Magazine\" that he uncovered the skeleton on a tall hill and was amazed at his discovery. \"I bolted down the hill to get my mom because I knew I shouldn't be messing with it\", he said. The bones that Linster discovered on that hilltop led to the excavation of a skeleton that was approximately 95 percent complete. Because of its completeness Florida Paleontology Institute Director Martin Shugar compared it to the 'Rosetta Stone' that enabled archaeologists to translate Egyptian hieroglyphics. Yale paleontologist John Ostrom, who reintroduced the theory of bird evolution from dinosaurs after his 1964 discovery of \"Deinonychus\" in Wyoming, agreed, calling the specimen a \"jewel\", and telling reporters that the completeness and undistorted qualities of the bones should help scientists further understand the dinosaur-bird link.\n\nThe fossil first was seen as the young of \"Saurornitholestes\" and in 1997 reported as belonging to a \"Velociraptor\" sp. In 2000 it was named and described by David Burnham, Kraig Derstler, Phil Currie, Robert Bakker, Zhou Zhonge and John Ostrom as a separate species: \"Bambiraptor feinbergi\". The generic name is derived from Bambi, in reference to the young age of the specimen, and a Latin \"raptor\", \"seizer\". The specific epithet honours Michael and Ann Feinberg who acquired the specimen from a fossil dealer and made it available to science. In 2000 George Olshevsky suggested the emended epithet \"feinbergorum\", the plural genitive, and this was followed by some authors but such emendations are no longer allowed by the ICZN.\n\nThe holotype specimen AMNH FR 30556 (previously AMNH 001 and FIP 001, sometimes wrongly referred to as AMNH FR 30554), was uncovered in layers of the Upper Two Medicine Formation dating to the late Campanian. It is currently housed at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. It consists of a partially articulated largely complete skeleton with skull of a juvenile individual. Though the right side of the skeleton is damaged, most bones are uncompressed and well-preserved. The end of the tail is lacking. Also a paratype was assigned in 2000, FIP 002-136, consisting of thirty-four skeletal elements of at least two adult individuals found near the holotype. In 2004 an upper jaw bone was referred to the species, specimen MOR 553S-7-30-91-274.\n\nWhile adult specimens are known, only the type specimen, a juvenile, has been described. This juvenile \"Bambiraptor\" has a preserved length of , and an estimated total length of one metre. It perhaps weighed only two kilograms (4.4 lb). In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the adult length at , the weight at five kilogrammes. It had long hindlimbs, indicating it could have been a fast runner. It also had very long arms and a well-developed wishbone.\n\nResearch done by Phil Senter of the Lamar State College in Orange, Texas has indicated that \"Bambiraptor\" may have had mutually opposable first and third fingers and a forelimb maneuverability that would allow the hand to reach its mouth. This would have given the animal the ability to \"hold\" food in its front limbs and place it in its mouth, in a similar manner to some modern-day small mammals.\n\n\"Bambiraptor\" had a brain size in the lower range of modern birds. Because of its enlarged cerebellum, which may indicate higher agility and higher intelligence than other dromaeosaurs, David A. Burnham has hypothesized that \"Bambiraptor feinbergi\" may have been arboreal. Life in the trees may have required evolutionary pressure that resulted in a larger brain. Burnham also offers an alternative hypothesis that a larger brain could be selected for as a result of hunting more agile prey items such as lizards and mammals. The \"Bambiraptor\" holotype had with 14 cm³ the largest brain for its size of any dinosaur yet discovered, although the brain size may be due to its age, because juvenile animals tend to have larger brain-to-body ratios compared to adults.\n\nDuring the conference where \"Bambiraptor\" was first introduced, the dinosaur reconstruction specialist Brian Cooley portrayed \"Bambiraptor\" as having feathers, despite the fact that no feathers were found with the fossil itself. His decision was influenced by the fact that because \"Bambiraptor\" within a cladistic analysis was a member of a group, Paraves, that contained feathered true birds and that was the sister taxon of Oviraptorosauria, a group that also had feathered forms (e.g. \"Caudipteryx\"), \"Bambiraptor\" most likely had feathers too due to phylogenetic bracketing. Most paleontologists support Cooley's view, and subsequent discoveries confirmed that small dromaeosaurid dinosaurs like \"Bambiraptor\" were fully covered in feathers (see Dromaeosauridae for more information).\n\n\"Bambiraptor\" was assigned to the Dromaeosauridae in 2000. Subsequent cladistic analyses differ in the position of \"Bambiraptor\": it has been recovered in the Velociraptorinae, Microraptoria and most recently in the Saurornitholestinae.\n\n\n"}

It lived in the Early Cretaceous, 126 million years ago. It was discovered in China by a team of American and Chinese scientists. \"Liaoceratops\" was much smaller than its later relatives, but offers a glimpse into the early evolution of this group of dinosaurs.\n\n\"Liaoceratops\" was discovered in the famous Liaoning Province of China, where several fossils of feathered dinosaurs have also been collected.\nThe type species \"Liaoceratops yanzigouensis\" was in 2002 named and described by Xu Xing, Peter Makovicky, Wang Xiaolin, Mark Norell and You Hailu. The generic name is derived from Liaoning and the Greek \"keras\", \"horn\" and \"ops\", \"face\". The specific name refers to the town Yanzigou.\n\nThe holotype IVPP V12738 has been found in the Yixian Formation dating from the Barremian. These beds have also yielded fossil insects, fossils of ginkgo trees, and many other dinosaurs, including the early troodontid \"Sinovenator\", also described by Makovicky later in 2005.\n\n\"This area is yielding extremely important information on the evolution of dinosaurs, mammals, insects, and flowering plants. I hope to find even more primitive specimens than \"Liaoceratops\",\" Peter Makovicky said.\n\nThe holotype consists of an almost complete skull. As paratype specimen IVPP V12633 has been referred, the skull of a juvenile. In 2007 another skull, CAGS-IG-VD-002, of an even younger individual was referred. This lacked the skull roof, which has been explained as the result of a predator opening the braincase to eat the contents.\n\n\"Liaoceratops\" is rather small, with a holotype skull length of 154 millimetres, weighing an estimated seven pounds and possessing only jugal horns and a small skull frill, lacking the orbital horns and true neck shield that characterized later ceratopsians. However, these features help understand a major split in the evolution of ceratopsians. Long before the familiar \"Triceratops\" evolved in North America, the ceratopsian lineage branched into two lines: the neoceratopsians, the main lineage that includes the recognizable horned and frilled forms, and of which \"Liaoceratops\" in 2002 was the most basal known member, and the Psittacosauridae, a radiation of smaller, parrot-beaked dinosaurs.\n\n\"\"Liaoceratops\" gives us a great window on the early evolution of horned dinosaurs and tells us that \"Triceratops\" and its relatives evolved from very small Asian ceratopsians. This small, primitive dinosaur is actually more interesting to science in many ways than its larger, more famous relatives because it teaches us more about evolution. Basal dinosaurs are critical because they help us to tie different groups of dinosaurs together and map out evolutionary patterns,\" said Peter Makovicky, Curator of Dinosaurs at the Field Museum in Chicago and a co-author of the paper describing the dinosaur.\n\n\"\"Liaoceratops\" establishes that this split occurred no later than the earliest part of the Cretaceous Period. Also, it indicates that ceratopsians acquired some of their distinctive features earlier and more rapidly than was previously recognized,\" Makovicky said.\n\nIronically, the diminutive \"Liaoceratops\" may also help scientists understand the roles of horns and frills in ceratopsian dinosaurs. First thought of as offensive or defensive organs, these structures are seen by many paleontologists today as display devices used in species recognition and to attract mates. \"Liaoceratops\" has a small jugal horn facing sideways under and behind each of its eyes. As this structure is relatively small and light, Makovicky believed that it was a display organ and had no purpose in defense.\n\n\n"}

He is occasionally referred to as \"\"Mad\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Maddest Writer,\" this being a twist on Don Martin's former status as \"\"Mad\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Maddest Artist.\" DeBartolo served as the magazine's \"Creative Consultant\" from 1984 to 2009.\n\n\"Mad\" has long spaced out DeBartolo's articles to ensure that at least one appears in every issue. As of his byline in issue #547 in 2016, new DeBartolo material has appeared in 445 consecutive issues, dating back to 1966. This is the longest such streak, nine issues ahead of runner-up Sergio Aragonés (whose streak is also active). (Aragonés would be 25 issues ahead of DeBartolo's run if not for a single missed issue, #111.\n\nDeBartolo has written well over 250 television or film parodies for the magazine, easily the most by any \"Mad\" writer.\n\nDeBartolo recounted his first-ever experience submitting material to \"Mad\" in 1961:\n\nDeBartolo was also a writer for several TV game shows, beginning with Barry-Enright before moving on to Goodson-Todman. DeBartolo was on the staff of the original \"Match Game\" in 1962, when the show was cancelled by NBC. In what were supposed to be the final weeks of the program, DeBartolo is credited with coming up with the silly and suggestive style of questions that the show is remembered for, which led to improved ratings and an \"un-cancellation\" that kept the show on the air. At the same time, DeBartolo cast several of the show's panelists and guests in his own 8mm film comedies, which he shot on the studio's rooftop. A rare public showing of those films was held in a Manhattan hotel ballroom in 1964.\n\nDeBartolo told Game Show Network in 2006 that when \"Match Game\" moved its production west to Los Angeles in the 1970s, he stayed in New York and mailed in his questions to the \"Match Game\" staff in Los Angeles. The 1973 West Coast-based version ran for nine more years on CBS and in syndication, with DeBartolo as a long-distance contributor; even writing questions for the \"Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\" on NBC and the 1990 revival on ABC. Besides his experience on the \"Match Game\", DeBartolo served as creative consultant on other Goodson-Todman game shows, such as \"Tattletales\" and \"Super Password\". In 1971, he was able to induce \"Mad\" publisher William M. Gaines to appear on \"To Tell the Truth\" as himself. However, all four panelists failed to pick out the real Gaines. After stumping the panel, Gaines jokingly denied knowing DeBartolo. After the episode, panelist Kitty Carlisle told DeBartolo, \"I never figured it was him. I mean, look at the way he's dressed. I was looking for someone who ran a very successful magazine, so I thought it \"couldn't\" be him!\"\n\nDeBartolo's book, \"Good Days and Mad: A Hysterical Tour Behind the Scenes at Mad Magazine\" (1994), traces his first 30 years at \"Mad\" and details his friendship with publisher William Gaines. Featuring contributions from other \"Mad\" writers and artists, the book recounts memorable anecdotes, notably the ascent that DeBartolo, Gaines, and Gaines' wife Annie once made through the arm of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nDeBartolo was also the author of numerous non-reprint \"Mad\" paperbacks, including \"MAD-vertising\", \"MAD Murders the Movies\", and \"The MAD Book of Sex, Violence, and Home Cooking\". DeBartolo also scripted several of Don Martin's \"Captain Klutz\" adventures, which appeared in Martin's series of paperbacks.\n\nIn February 2006, Dick DeBartolo and Leo Laporte began producing a podcast called The Daily Giz Wiz, a short, daily discussion about technology and gadgets appearing on TWiT.tv. Each episode features one gadget chosen by DeBartolo, except for Tuesdays, when Laporte chose it (Turn The Tables Tuesday). Many times, the gadget is not a fancy mainstream one, but a weird, odd, or extremely simple device. For the Friday episodes, DeBartolo picks the gadget from his Gadget Warehouse, an actual storage facility in NYC he rents for keeping his old gadgets.\n\nFor its 600th episode on June 27, 2008. DeBartolo traveled from NYC to Petaluma, California to do the 600th show with Laporte on TWiT Live; the gadget was \"Fred Lanes\" third hand.\n\nA shorter, weekly version of \"The Daily Giz Wiz\" had formerly appeared on Laporte's syndicated radio show The Tech Guy, but was discontinued after a radio network request to make way for more live callers. But, as of mid-2010, Dick comes on Laporte's radio show on Saturday to discuss a gadget. In 2011, the daily netcast program was refactored into a weekly netcast, therefore retitled \"The Weekly Daily Giz Wiz.\" \n\nOn July 24, 2012, \"The Weekly Daily Giz Wiz,\" changed its day, format, and show title (again). Currently appearing on Thursdays, \"The Giz Wiz\" features DeBartolo and Chad \"OMGChad\" Johnson (or Leo Laporte before January 2014) sharing gadget reviews, a random gadget, and a pick from the \"Gadget Warehouse.\" A new segment, in connection with \"Turn the Table Turkey,\" started on July 31, 2012, features \"Crap We Found in Skymall,\" where the viewers vote on the gadget they want reviewed on the next week's show.

He was a part of the Yankees' 1998 World Series championship over the San Diego Padres.\n\nBush attended East St. Louis High School in East St. Louis, Illinois, and was a standout wide receiver. He is mentioned periodically in a book titled \"The Right Kind Of Heroes\" written by Kevin Horrigan. The book details Coach Bob Shannon and the remarkable success of the East St. Louis Flyers football program in 1989 and 1990. Throughout the book, Bush is referenced as the team's \"go to\" player, as well as a likeable person.\n\nBush still holds the Illinois State High School football records for most touchdowns scored in a single season and most receiving yards in a single season. He was also named to the All-Century team for Illinois High School Football.\n\nBush was recruited by the University of Missouri to play receiver following his high school football career, but opted to pursue baseball as a career.\n\nThe San Diego Padres selected Bush in the 1991 Major League Baseball draft. His first year in the minor leagues he batted .323 with the Arizona Padres of the Rookie-level Arizona League. After batting only .234 in 1992 for the Charleston Rainbows of the Class A South Atlantic League, he batted .322 with 39 stolen bases in 1993 for the Waterloo Diamonds of the Class A Midwest League winning Minor League Player of the Year for the Padres organization. In winter baseball, he played in Australia, hitting .364 and winning the batting title and being named the league MVP. In 1994, Bush split his time between the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the Class A-Advanced California League, where he hit .335, and the Wichita Wranglers of the Class AA Texas League, where he hit .298. He then spent that off-season in the Australian Baseball League with the Brisbane Bandits. In 1995, Bush hit .280 with 34 stolen bases for the Memphis Chicks of the Class AA Southern League, the Padres' new Class AA affiliate. Bush was promoted to the Las Vegas Stars of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League in 1996, hitting .362 before suffering a broken leg. \n\nIn 1997, the Padres traded Bush along with pitcher Hideki Irabu to the New York Yankees for outfielder Rubén Rivera and pitcher Rafael Medina. Bush split time between the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League and the New York Yankees. Bush hit .364 in 11 at-bats with the big league club.\n\nBush made the major league roster with the New York Yankees in 1998, and was part of the team's 1998 World Series championship. During the regular season, he batted .380 and stole six bases in only 45 games. After the 1998 season, Bush was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, along with pitchers Graeme Lloyd and David Wells, for pitcher Roger Clemens.\n\nBush played in Toronto from 1999 until 2002.

He was active as a lyricist of musical theatre, and had columns in various specialized magazines about culture and sports.\n\nMeglin graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a certificate from the School of Visual Arts.\n\nMeglin spent most of his career at \"Mad\", on whose editorial staff he worked for 48 years. His progress can be observed by studying the magazine's masthead, which moved him from \"Ideas\" to \"War Correspondent\" (during an army stint) to \"Editorial Associate\" to \"Associate Editor\" to \"Editor,\" a position which he held for 20 years. His business cards used to identify him as \"Mad\"s Tennis Editor. After retiring from that job in 2004, Meglin was listed as a Contributing Editor. During the course of his career with \"Mad\", he discovered and mentored artists such as Sam Viviano.\n\nAlthough he had fewer than ten official bylines in 48 years, Meglin was a major behind-the-scenes contributor to the satirical magazine's contents and direction. MAD artists had often caricatured themselves and their compatriots, particularly Sergio Aragones and Dave Berg's \"The Lighter Side of\", and Meglin was often portrayed as a tennis player due to his love of the sport.\n\nIn addition to his work on \"Mad\", Meglin wrote for the musical theater.

{"id": "1993765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993765", "title": "Roaring Fork Valley", "text": "Roaring Fork Valley\n\nThe Roaring Fork Valley is a geographical region in western Colorado in the United States. The Roaring Fork Valley is one of the most affluent regions in Colorado and the U.S. as well as one of the most populous and economically vital areas of the Colorado Western Slope. The Valley is defined by the valley of the Roaring Fork River and its tributaries, including the Crystal and Fryingpan River. It includes the communities of Aspen, Snowmass Village, Basalt, Carbondale, and Glenwood Springs. Mount Sopris and the Roaring Fork River serve as symbols of the Roaring Fork Valley.\n\nThe valley was inhabited by the Ute people prior to the coming of the first U.S. settlers over Independence Pass in 1879. The first settlers were prospectors looking for silver in the wake of the Colorado Silver Boom in nearby Leadville. Aspen flourished as a mining community in the late 1880s and early 1890s until the silver crash of 1893. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, coal mining in the valley of the Crystal emerged as an important extractive industry, one that has nearly entirely vanished (coal is still extracted south of McClure Pass in the nearby North Fork Valley).\n\nThe Roaring Fork Valley is part of the larger Roaring Fork Watershed, which includes the Fryingpan and Crystal River valleys. The valley extends for approximately southeast to northwest from Aspen northwest to Glenwood Springs at the mouth of the Roaring Fork on the Colorado River, ranging in width between . It is surrounded by mountains on all sides, in particular on its southwest edge by the high Elk Mountains that are location of the popular Aspen/Snowmass ski resorts. The upper (southeast) end of the valley is sometimes called the Aspen Valley, but locals simply refer to it as \"up-valley\" - Aspen - and \"down-valley\" - Glenwood Springs. Mount Sopris dominates the lower (northwest) end of the valley and serves as an unofficial symbol of the region. Many think the Roaring Fork River, from which the valley was named, is the unofficial symbol of the region.\n\nThe politics of the Roaring Fork Watershed are somewhat complex, arising principally from the fact that the watershed is split awkwardly among four different counties: Pitkin (Aspen), Eagle County (Basalt), Garfield County (Glenwood Springs, Carbondale), and Gunnison County. The fragmented structure is in contrast to the nearby Eagle Valley, which lies entirely within Eagle County. The fragmented governmental structure has made the adoption of a comprehensive land-use and growth policy more difficult, especially in regard to Aspen, which has struggled between the extremes of allowing unbridled growth leading to sprawl and restricting growth altogether. Roaring Fork Conservancy works on river and water issues across these lines and the Roaring Fork Watershed Collaborative works to address regional issues in this geographic area.\n\nThe main economic engine of the valley is the Aspen/Snowmass recreational skiing complex which directly or indirectly drives the related tourism, hospitality, retail, construction, real estate, professional service and property maintenance industries. Although skiing forms the foundation of the economy, other activities increasingly contribute to visitor numbers. Non-winter recreational and cultural activities such as fly fishing on the Fryingpan and whitewater rafting on the Roaring Fork, hiking near the Maroon Bells in the Maroon Bells–Snowmass Wilderness, enjoying the caverns and hot springs in Glenwood Springs, the Aspen Institute and Rocky Mountain Institute conferences, the Aspen Music Festival, and numerous other cultural events attract visitors year-round. \nAlthough the valley floor is largely privately owned, most of the surrounding highlands are within the White River National Forest and are another major source of recreation and tourism. Agriculture, principally livestock raising, plays a very moderate and declining role in the valley's economy. However, the ranches that still cover large parts of the lower valley contribute to tourism as well through their beauty and through events like the Carbondale Rodeo. Potato cultivation has historically been important in the lower valley, but is virtually nonexistent at present.\n\nThe valley has been one of the most rapidly growing areas of Colorado in recent years, not only in the vicinity of Aspen, but notably in the lower end of the valley below Basalt. The communities of Basalt and Carbondale have served as bedroom communities for day workers in Aspen, where high property values have increasingly strained the ability of low and middle-income workers to afford the cost of living, though the affluence that marks the Upper Roaring Fork Valley is gradually leaking into the rest of the Valley. Many employees in Glenwood Springs live further down the Colorado river due to the same acute lack of affordable housing.\n\nState Highway 82 serves as the principal transportation artery of the valley, having many freeway characteristics. The once rural character of much of the valley has been replaced with nearly continuous development linking the region's four main cities. Though parts of the valley are largely rural, the valley is served by an extensive public transportation system called the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority, which provides public transit along the popular commuting route between Aspen and Glenwood Springs.\n\n"}

Sethna\n\nKaikhosru Danjibuoy Sethna (26 November 1904 – 29 June 2011) was an Indian poet, scholar, writer, philosopher, and cultural critic. He published more than 50 books. He was also known as \"Amal Kiran\".\n\nSethna was born as a Parsi in Bombay on 25 November 1904. His father was a physician and specialist eye surgeon. He was a voracious reader and also a bit of a writer, giving his son a lot of support in developing his talents.\n\nAt the age of two and half, Sethna suffered a polio infection crippling his left foot. Three years later, when several therapeutic efforts had failed, his father took him to London for a corrective operation after which Sethna was able to walk straight again, though with a slight limp. \n\nSethna received his early education at the reputed St. Xavier’s College, a Roman Catholic institution run by foreign Jesuit priests. He practically grew up with English as his mother tongue and was less fluent in Parsi Gujarati, also spoken at home. \n\nHe began his literary career very early, publishing book reviews in newspapers and magazines. His first book, titled \"Parnassians\", appeared in 1924. It was a collection of essays on the works of H. G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Gilbert Keith Chesterton and Thomas Hardy. When one of Sethna’s well-wishers sent a copy of the book to Wells, the latter is reported to have commented, “the young man will go far.”\n\nAs a College student, Sethna started reading books on Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga and especially the works of Swami Vivekananda. He also met a saint in Bombay and a yogi in Maharashtra and felt inspired through these meetings. \n\nSome time later Sethna came to know about Sri Aurobindo from a Theosophist and also discovered an article on the Sri Aurobindo Ashram which he read with great interest. After having married his long-term girl friend Daulat, they decided to go to Pondicherry for visiting Sri Aurobindo and the Mother (Mirra Alfassa).\n\nSethna and his wife arrived in the Ashram in December 1927. After having met the Mother and Sri Aurobindo, he decided to join the Ashram along with his wife, who was renamed “Lalita”, which is a name of one of Radha’s companions. Sethna received from Sri Aurobindo the new name “Amal Kiran”, meaning “Pure Ray”.\n\nAs a first work Sethna was given the task of managing the Ashram stores, looking after the various practical needs of the members. Much of his free time he dedicated to developing his poetry, regularly sending his numerous creations to Sri Aurobindo for getting his opinion and corrections. In 1936 Sri Aurobindo started sending him his handwritten texts of his literary main work \"\" for typing. As a result, there also followed a correspondence on Sri Aurobindo’s spiritual poetry, discussing its peculiar characteristics, its style and planes of inspiration. \n\nSome time in 1937, Sethna and his wife got divorced, and he married Sehra, a friend of his youth from Bombay. She remained his companion until her death in 1980.\n\nIn 1949, the journal \"Mother India\" was started by the Ashram. Its purpose was to discuss current topics, both National and International, from a viewpoint which was in line with Sri Aurobindo’s thought, although it was not directly meant to be his mouthpiece. Sethna was appointed its editor, and he sent all his political articles for approval to Sri Aurobindo. However, after Sri Aurobindo’s departure in 1950 the Mother advised Sethna not to touch directly on politics. \n\nThe articles were not only on Sri Aurobindo and his yoga, but also included many other topics in the field of literature, culture and art. The authors were, apart from the editor himself, other members of the Ashram or followers of Sri Aurobindo and sometimes also outsiders.\n\nApart from his contributions in \"Mother India\", Sethna also occasionally published articles in other journals and wrote more than fifty books on Sri Aurobindo, the Mother, integral Yoga, poetry, science, philosophy, ancient Indian history and other subjects. His great sense of humour came out in his title \"Light and Laughter\".\n\nSethna was born a Parsi-Zoroastrian, but discontinued its practice after becoming a disciple of Sri Aurobindo. He celebrated his 100th birthday in 2004. At the time of his death, at the age of 106, he was one of the world's oldest living authors. The last few years of his life he had stayed at the Ashram Nursing Home.\n\n\n\n"}

Audit management helps simplify and well-organise the workflow and collaboration process of compiling audits. Most audit teams heavily rely on email and shared drive for sharing information with each other. Typically task such as submitting client request, sender reminder and following up on findings are all done from using broad tools. Investing in the right software could help save time, reduce errors and save on resources.\n\nAudit management oversees the internal/external audit staff, establishes audit programs, and hires and trains the appropriate audit personnel. The staff should have the necessary skills and expertise to identify inherent risks of the business and assess the overall effectiveness of controls in place relating to the company's internal controls.\n\nInternal audit is a function set up within the organisation to reduce the risk of fraud in the organisation and runs according to the management commands. This is the main difference between internal and external audit where external auditors are independent of management and hence external auditors give an opinion on the financial statements as presented by the management of the organisation. This is performed by the companies internal auditing team, this can help companies improve because strengths and weaknesses are identified. Senior internal audit managers need to manage the responsibilities of what different people want.\n\nLike all supervisor that are part of the business there is a need to:\n\nThe objectives of an external audit or audits being conducted by someone not part of the business, is when one business audits a different business to determine if the accounting records are complete and correctly prepared according to GAAP (GAAP is the highest U.S. power on accounting standards and they must be followed by jurisprudence when preparing financial information for businesses) provisions. The organisations have a formal agreement for the supply of goods and services. External audits make good business exercise.\n\nSmaller businesses benefit from external audit because it can act as an education for small business owners, as many small business owners don't have an in-depth understanding of accounting. Businesses can use external auditor to spot mistakes that might have occurred and went noticed. Errors that occur in accounting statements can lead to businesses making bad decisions. For larger corporation audit provide confidence to the shareholder and investors that the figures shown in the books is reliable. Audit management for external auditors might be surpass than the businesses they work with because they are likely to be investing in the best software possible and are a specialist for that particular area.\n\nCompanies have to appoint an auditor to do an annual external audit on your accounts if your business is:\n\nA third party audit gives feedback to important documents and processes including quality manuals or performance development plan, records including instructing, organisational charts, and examination of the processes within the extent of the audit. A third party audit is conducted by an audit organisation that doesn't have the traditional customer-supplier relationship and does not carry any conflict of interest. Institutions such as registrars (certification bodies) or legislature are usually the types of organisations that perform these types of audit.\n\nTo manage an audit team in a manner to achieve good results, it is important that audit managers have strong leadership skills, workers want to work for someone that has moved up the ranks which shows that the manager they work with has experience doing the job team members are doing. It is important that the teams works efficiently, carrying out audit can be time consuming so being organised and managing different information helps with the productiveness. Auditing involves planning, method, facts, procedures, controls, risk, and management. Communication skills is key to many successful auditors, as you develop through your career getting you message across in your unique way clearly helps project your professionalism. Auditors from different countries may work with each other to help the same client, it is common for auditors to work directly at their client company in their offices.\n\nIt is important that the United Kingdom economy has organised and effective capital markets and there is self-assurance in the business framework through greater transparency.

The oldest professional orchestra in Australia, the MSO is resident at Hamer Hall. The MSO has its own choir, the MSO Chorus, following integration with the Melbourne Chorale in 2008.\n\nThe Orchestra relies on funding by the Victorian State Government and the Federal government and support from private corporations and donors. It is supported by Symphony Services International. Sophie Galaise joined the MSO as its first female Managing Director in 2016. Its current Chairman is Michael Ullmer.\n\nThe MSO's first concert took place on 11 December 1906 under the baton of Alberto Zelman, founder of the MSO, who later became the first Australian conductor to conduct the London and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras. In 1934, the MSO became one of the Australian Broadcasting Commission's radio orchestras. In 1949, the orchestra took on the new name of the Victorian Symphony Orchestra. In 1965, the orchestra's name reverted to the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe MSO's longest serving chief conductor was Hiroyuki Iwaki (1974–1997), who was named Conductor Laureate of the orchestra in 1989 and held the title until his death in 2006. The orchestra's most recent Chief Conductor, Sir Andrew Davis (conductor), was appointed in June 2012. Sir Andrew Davis gave his inaugural concerts as the MSO's Chief Conductor in 2013, having made his debut with the orchestra in 2009.

In January 2000, under the baton of the then Chief Conductor and Artistic Director Markus Stenz, the MSO represented Australasia at the Festival of the Five Continents in the Canary Islands alongside other orchestras such as the Berlin Philharmonic and New York Philharmonic. In January 2007 the Orchestra embarked on its second European tour, visiting five cities in Spain (Castellon, Barcelona, Zaragoza, Pamplona, Madrid), Paris, Berlin and Milan.\n\nSir Andrew Davis became chief conductor in 2013. During his tenure, the MSO made its debut at five of the classical music festivals, including The Proms and the Edinburgh International Festival.

According to some accounts in Hindu mythology, Ketu belongs to Jaimini Gotra, whereas Rahu is from Paiteenasa gotra; hence the two are entirely different entities with distinct characteristics but nonetheless are two parts of a common body. Ketu is generally referred to as a \"shadow\" planet. It is believed to have a tremendous impact on human lives and also the whole creation. In some special circumstances it helps someone achieve the zenith of fame. Ketu is often depicted with a gem or star on his head signifying a mystery light. \n\nAs per Vedic astrology Rahu and Ketu have an orbital cycle of 18 years and are always 180 degrees from each other orbitally (as well as in the birth charts). This coincides with the precessional orbit of moon or the ~18-year rotational cycle of the lunar ascending and descending nodes on the earth's ecliptic plane. Ketu rules the Scorpio zodiac sign together with Mangala\n\nAstronomically, Rahu and Ketu denote the points of intersection of the paths of the Sun and the Moon as they move on the celestial sphere. Therefore, Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south lunar nodes. The fact that eclipses occur when the Sun and the Moon are at one of these points gives rise to the understanding of swallowing of the Sun and the Moon by the snake. Ketu is responsible for causing the Eclipse of the Moon.\n\nIn Hindu astrology Ketu represents karmic collections both good and bad, spirituality and supernatural influences. Ketu signifies the spiritual process of the refinement of materialisation to spirit and is considered both malefic and benefic, as it causes sorrow and loss, and yet at the same time turns the individual to God. In other words, it causes material loss in order to force a more spiritual outlook in the person. Ketu is a \"karaka\" or indicator of intelligence, wisdom, non-attachment, fantasy, penetrating insight, derangement, and psychic abilities. Ketu is believed to bring prosperity to the devotee's family, removes the effects of snakebite and illness arising out of poisons. He grants good health, wealth and cattle to his devotees. Ketu is the lord of three nakshatras or lunar mansions: Ashvini, Magha and Mula.\n\nKetu is considered responsible for \"moksha\", \"sannyasa\", self-realization, \"gnana\", a wavering nature, restlessness, the endocrine system and slender physique.\n\nThe people who come under the influence of Ketu can achieve great heights, most of them spiritual.\n\nRahu, being a karmic planet would show the necessity and urge to work on a specific area of life where there had been ignorance in the past life. To balance the apparent dissatisfaction one has to go that extra mile to provide a satisfactory settlement in the present lifetime. Rahu can remove all negetive quality of every planet while Ketu can emphasis every positive quality of the planet.\n\nRuler of Ketu: According to the most popular astrology text Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, (BPHS) Ketu is related to Matsya.\n\nExaltation and Debilitation: This has been a debatable point in astrology, as per BPHS Ketu is exalted in the sign of Scorpio and debilitated in Taurus, however, many astrologers have disputed this and most modern astrologers now seem to agree that Ketu is exalted in Sagittarius and debilitated in Gemini . This stands to logic as Ketu is a torso and a prominent part of Sagittarius is big horse torso attached to a male upper body.\n\nNegative Significations: While Ketu is considered malefic and has been mostly associated with negative things. Most people consider it a difficult planet as it brings lot of troubles on the material plane. It often brings a sense of complete detachment, losses, mindlessness, wandering, and confusion in one's life. \n\nPositive Significations: There is a much deeper side to Ketu and it has been called the most spiritual of all planets. Ketu has been considered the planet of enlightenment and liberation. As the one who has “lost his head (worldly senses)” Being a personification of renunciation (torso without a head who needs nothing). Ketu the ascetic that wants to go beyond the mundane life and achieve the final liberation.\n\nFriends Planets: Ketu is a friend of Mercury, Venus, and Saturn. Jupiter is neutral in friendship. Sun, Moon, and Mars are Ketu's enemies.\n"}

In 1996 they toured briefly as an opening act for the then-popular band Live but were not received well by the Live fanbase. Thinking Fellers has been largely dormant since 1996, having toured sporadically and released only one full album, \"Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche\", since.\n\nIn 2001, author Jonathan Franzen referenced the band in his novel \"The Corrections\". The character Brian, a snobbish fan of \"west coast underground bands,\" listens to the albums of Thinking Fellers while writing the music software that will make him a young millionaire.\n\nOn January 7, 2011, the All Tomorrow's Parties festival announced a Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 performance at the ATP festival weekend May 13–15, 2011 curated by Animal Collective.\n\nIn 2017, Beverly Williams's book \"Survival Kit's Apocalypse\" quoted the lines \"If the sadness of life makes you tired/And the failures of man make you sigh/You can look to the time soon arriving/When this noble experiment winds down and calls it a day\" from the Fellers' song \"Noble Experiment\" from \"Strangers from the Universe\". In 2019, The National interpolated those same lines in their song \"Not in Kansas\" on the album \"I Am Easy to Find\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the oldest capitals of the Yoruba-speaking people, tracing its establishment to a settlement founded by a descendant of Oduduwa, also known as Odudua, Oòdua and Eleduwa. The regents of the town were traditionally styled \"Alaketu\", and are related directly to Ile-ife in present-day Nigeria.\n\nKetu is one of the sixteen original kingdoms established by the children of Oduduwa in Oyo mythic history, though this ancient pedigree has been somewhat neglected in contemporary Yoruba historical research, which tends to focus on communities within Nigeria. The exact status of Ketu within the Oyo empire however is contested. Oyo sources claim Ketu as a dependency with claims that the Ketu paid an annual tribute and that its ruler attended the Bere festival in Oyo. In any case, there is no doubt that Ketu and Oyo maintained friendly relations largely due to their historical, linguistic, cultural and ethnic ties.\n\nThe kingdom was one of the main enemies of the ascendant kingdom of Dahomey, often fighting against Dahomeans as part of Oyo's imperial forces, but ultimately succumbing to the Fon in the 1880s as the kingdom was ravaged. Many of Ketu's citizens were sold into slavery during these raids, which accounts for the kingdom's importance in Brazilian Candomblé. Ketu is often known as Queto in Portuguese orthography.\n\nEwe traditions refer to Ketu as \"Amedzofe\" (\"origin of humanity\") or \"Mawufe\" (\"home of the Supreme Being\"). It is believed that the inhabitants (or at least some) of Ketu originally belonged to the Oyo people of Nigeria and were pressed westward by a series of wars between the 12th and the 15th centuries. In Ketu, the ancestors of the Gbe speaking peoples (Ewe, Fon, Aja etc.) separated themselves from other refugees and began to establish their own identity, but were pressed even further westward by the Yoruba during the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1993959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993959", "title": "Meng Da", "text": "Meng Da\n\nMeng Da () (died 228), courtesy name Zidu, was a military general of the state of Cao Wei during the early Three Kingdoms period of China. He previously served the warlords Liu Zhang and Liu Bei during the late Eastern Han dynasty before defecting to Wei. In Wei, he served under the first two rulers, Cao Pi and Cao Rui. Around late 227, he started a rebellion in Wei and aimed to rejoin the Shu-Han but the revolt was swiftly suppressed by the Wei general Sima Yi. Meng Da was captured and executed for treason.\n\nMeng Da originally served Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). He defected to another warlord, Liu Bei, when the latter invaded Yi Province in the early 210s and seized control of the province from Liu Zhang. Liu Bei sent Meng Da to guard Jiangling (), and promoted him to Administrator () of Yidu () later after settling Yi Province. Meng Da's original courtesy name was \"Zijing\", but he changed it to \"Zidu\" to avoid naming taboo because \"Zijing\" was also the courtesy name of Liu Bei's uncle.\n\nIn 219, Meng Da was ordered to lead a force from Zigui () to attack Fangling (). After conquering Fangling, Meng Da advanced further north and captured another city, Shangyong (), where he rendezvoused with Liu Feng, Liu Bei's adoptive son. Later that year, when Liu Bei's general Guan Yu was trapped by enemy forces in Jing Province, Guan requested reinforcements from Liu Feng and Meng Da, but they refused. Guan Yu was eventually captured by forces of the eastern warlord Sun Quan and was executed.\n\nMeng Da was afraid that he would be punished for refusing to help Guan Yu. At the time, his relationship with Liu Feng was also strained, hence he brought 4,000 soldiers with him and defected to Liu Bei's rival Cao Pi, who gave him a warm welcome. Meng Da then wrote a letter to Liu Feng, informing the latter that he was in grave danger, because someone close to Liu Bei had spoken ill of him, and he urged Liu Feng to surrender to Wei as well. However, Liu Feng ignored Meng Da's advice and returned to Chengdu, where he was executed by his adoptive father for failing to reinforce Guan Yu and failing to stop Meng Da from defecting.\n\nCao Pi later ended the Eastern Han Dynasty by forcing Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him, after which he became emperor and established the state of Cao Wei, marking the start of the Three Kingdoms period. In Wei, Meng Da received various important appointments and the title of a marquis. Cao Pi merged the three commanderies of Fangling, Shangyong and Xicheng () to form a larger commandery, Xincheng (), and he appointed Meng Da as the Administrator () of Xincheng and tasked him with defending Wei's southwestern border. Meng Da became close friends with the Wei officials Huan Jie and Xiahou Shang.\n\nIn 225, Li Hong (), a former Wei subject who surrendered to Shu Han (a state founded by Liu Bei), came to meet Shu's chancellor Zhuge Liang and the Shu officials Jiang Wan and Fei Shi. Li Hong told them about Meng Da's meeting with a person called Wang Chong (), who told him that Zhuge Liang urged Liu Bei to execute Meng Da's family after Meng defected to Wei, but Liu Bei refused. Meng Da also did not believe Wang Chong.\n\nZhuge Liang attempted to contact Meng Da and induce him to defect back to Shu, despite objection from Fei Shi, who remarked that Meng Da was an untrustworthy traitor. By then, the Wei emperor Cao Pi had died and was succeeded by Cao Rui, who treated Meng Da less favourably. Meng Da's close friends Huan Jie and Xiahou Shang had also died, so Meng Da felt isolated and became increasingly disgruntled with the Wei imperial court. After some exchanging of letters between Zhuge Liang and Meng Da, the latter gradually developed animosity towards Wei and harboured the intention of starting a rebellion.\n\nIn 228, Zhuge Liang launched the first of a series of Northern Expeditions against Wei, and he succeeded in persuading Meng Da to assist the Shu army by rebelling against Wei. However, Meng Da's rebellion plot was leaked out by Shen Yi (), the Administrator of Weixing (), whom Meng Da had a feud with. The Wei general Sima Yi wrote letters to Meng Da to put the latter in a dilemma on whether to rebel or not, and secretly led an army from Wan (in present-day Nanyang, Henan) to attack Meng Da's base in Xincheng. Sima Yi's forces arrived at Xincheng in just eight days and caught Meng Da completely off guard. Meng Da was betrayed by his nephew Deng Xian () and subordinate Li Fu () and his rebellion was swiftly suppressed. He was captured and executed by Sima Yi.\n\nMeng Da appeared as a character in the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\". His courtesy name in the novel is \"Ziqing\" (). His role in the novel is mainly centred on the events in the Xincheng Rebellion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1993973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993973", "title": "Magic: The Gathering core sets, 1993–2007", "text": "Magic: The Gathering core sets, 1993–2007\n\nThe collectible card game \"\" published nine core sets from 1993–2007, also referred to as basic sets and base sets. These sets consisted entirely of reprints, usually focusing on staple cards Wizards of the Coast felt should always be available. These cards were generally simpler than cards in expansion sets, omitting multicolored cards, and used only the original abilities and keywords of \"Magic\" such as , and . As \"Magic\" grew, the base sets were considered descendants of the original \"Limited Edition\", and shaped the default setting and feel of \"Magic\". In contrast, \"Magic\" \"expansion sets\" usually chose a particular theme, such as artifacts for \"\". All cards were given a white border to mark them as reprints, with a few exceptions (\"Tenth Edition\", foil cards in \"Seventh\"-\"Ninth\" Editions). From \"Fourth Edition\" in 1995 onward, a new base set would come out once per two years in the spring or early summer; for tournament play, that set would be legal for two years in the Standard format until the next core set replaced it.\n\nEarly in the history of \"Magic\", the sets sold out nearly instantaneously, and supplying the game's growing fan base proved tricky. Sales were also concentrated on the West Coast of the United States, where Wizards of the Coast was based. The earliest base sets—\"Unlimited\", \"Revised\", and \"Fourth Edition\"—helped provide the first experience with \"Magic\" for many players in areas where \"Magic\" had never been sold before, enabling them to catch up on the base game with cards that, while technically reprints, had never been available to them before. As the market became saturated, the base sets took on a changed role; they began to be marketed as the entry point for new \"Magic\" players, with less interest expected from dedicated \"Magic\" players who likely owned many of the cards already. \"Seventh Edition\", released in 2001, was sold both as a \"Basic\" and an \"Advanced\" product, with the expansion sets of the time marked as \"Expert.\" \"Eighth\" and \"Ninth\" editions were marketed similarly. However, sales were disappointing, an alarming problem for Wizards, as some entry point for newer players was required to keep \"Magic\" alive. In 2009, Wizards of the Coast changed their policy for core sets, and began making smaller core sets that included new cards, starting with the \"Magic 2010\" set. According to Wizards of the Coast, the previous core sets had \"been completely marginalized by the enfranchised player base\", and change was required to make the Core Sets of interest to players of all skill levels once more.\n\nUnlimited Edition, occasionally referred to as Second Edition, was the second \"Magic: The Gathering\" set. It was released on December 1, 1993, after \"Beta\" had sold out as quickly as \"Alpha\" had; this time the run was 40 million cards, the largest yet. \"Unlimited Edition\" contains exactly the same cards as \"Limited Edition Beta\", including the Power Nine cards, and the three sets are usually considered as a single set. \"Unlimited\" cards have white borders rather than black, however. This precedent that white borders implied a reprint was honored until the 2007 release of \"Tenth Edition\", which returned to black borders.\n\n\"Unlimited\" was sold in starter packs of 60 cards and booster packs of 15 cards. It was the first set to be officially titled as something other than just \"Magic: The Gathering\". The \"Unlimited Edition\" label appears on the booster boxes, decks, and booster packs. While it is possible to distinguish \"Unlimited\" cards from \"Revised\" cards by just looking at the text (wording and type set) the cards from both sets are more easily distinguished by comparing the borders of the cards. The picture frame of \"Unlimited\" cards has a beveled edge which \"Revised\" cards have not.\n\nRevised Edition (also simply known as \"Revised\") was the sixth set and third core set released for \"Magic: The Gathering\". Like previous core sets, it had no expansion symbol. \"Revised Edition\" cards are white-bordered and generally known for their washed-out look. The set was released in April 1994 and contained 306 cards. It was the first base set to contain cards from black-bordered sets other than \"Alpha\" and \"Beta\".\n\nPrinting of \"Revised\" began in early April 1994 and continued until April 1995, when \"Fourth Edition\" was announced. It is estimated that about 500 million cards of the set were produced, which fully eliminated the distribution problems of earlier sets. The cards of \"Revised\" were still widely available even well into 1996.\n\nThe cards of \"Revised\" like the cards of the preceding \"Unlimited Edition\" all had white borders, no expansion symbol, and the artist credit at the bottom left. However, the cards were far paler than their \"Unlimited\" counterparts, and the three-dimensional beveling of the cards was cropped out. This gave the cards an appearance that was widely criticized as \"washed out\" and even unprofessional. The beveling was returned in \"4th Edition\", and the colors were much more vibrant in that set. The large print run meant that \"Revised\" basic lands were so numerous and common that it was uncommon to find any other lands in decks until several years later.\n\nThe collation of the cards made it possible for a basic land card to appear in the common and uncommon slots of a pack. This was intentional; the land cards were printed on the common and uncommon print sheets. Basic lands would get their own full print sheets in \"4th Edition\", making \"Revised\" the last tournament-legal set until \"Seventh Edition\" in which basic lands could be found in booster packs. Basic lands returned as a card slot in the \"Shards of Alara\" block of 2008.\n\nOne card-printing error of note appeared on the card . This blue creature card was misprinted with a green border and a picture of another card, . The name, mana cost and rules text were all correct, though. The Revised version is now the most common due to the limited print run of the original, intended versions.\n\n\"Revised\" was the first base edition of the game to be sold in multiple languages. Black bordered, limited editions were produced in French, German, and Italian. Unlimited, white bordered editions in the same languages were produced after the limited editions had sold out.\n\nThe printing of \"Revised\" cleared up a number of rules problems that the \"\" and \"\" rules had. Two changes had a large effect on game play. First, the rule that \"multiple effects resolve simultaneously unless a conflict arises\" was changed to \"effects always resolve \". The concept was later refined and then referred to as the \"stack,\" an idea taken from computer programing's stack. Second, the rule for Protection from was changed from \"the creature ignores all effects\" to the more precise \"the creature cannot be blocked or targeted by sources, reduces damage to zero, and cannot be enchanted by enchantments.\"\n\nThe most visually obvious of \"Revised\"'s changes was the elimination of the Mono/Poly/Continuous qualifiers to artifacts. With the advent of the game's first tap symbol (a \"T\" turned forty-five degrees clockwise in a light gray circle), the qualifiers used to differentiate when and how often an artifact could be used were no longer needed. Artifacts that were previously classified as Mono artifacts were given the new tap symbol, while Poly and Continuous artifacts were simply re-templated without the tap symbol.\n\nThe Summer Magic print run of \"Revised Edition\" were printed in the summer of 1994. This print run intended to fix some of the errors with \"Revised\", including the washed-out color. As it turned out, the \"Summer Magic\" run had problems of its own. The colors were considered too dark and the artist credited for stayed uncorrected as well as the artist credited for Serendib Efreet, although the Efreet had received its original color and art again. Also a famous new misprint occurred with the card ; the so-called \"blue Hurricane\" is one of the rarest and most sought-after cards in the entirety of \"Magic\" because of its misprint with a blue border. On the secondary market it sells for thousands of dollars. The print run was recalled and destroyed; however, about 40 booster boxes that were shipped to England and Tennessee survived. No more than 11 or 12 of each rare exists.\n\nThis print run is known primarily for its extremely scarce and valuable cards and packs. Cards are distinguished by dark coloring and a 1994 copyright date displayed at the bottom, along with the artist credit. Booster packs look identical to normal \"Revised Edition\" packs, and as such, telling them apart is impossible without opening them. No starter decks were made.\n\nTwenty \"Revised\" cards were originally in the \"\" expansion, and another nineteen were originally in the \"\" expansion. Thirty-five cards that were in \"Unlimited\" were not in \"Revised\", including the Power Nine. A few of the cards that were removed from the base set reappeared in later sets, such as , which would be reprinted in \"\". A few others would be reprinted in \"Eighth Edition\" to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary. Cards removed were generally thought to either be confusing, or to have power level issues.\n\nNotable cards include:\n\nThe Fourth Edition of \"Magic: The Gathering\" was the tenth set released for the game, and the fourth base set. The set was released in April 1995 and contained 378 cards. It was the first set to reprint cards from the expansions \"\" and \"\". \"Fourth Edition\" cards have white borders. The set has no expansion symbol.\n\n\"Fourth Edition\" was the first \"Magic\" set to be printed in Asian languages. It was published in English, French, German, Italian, and as a first for a \"Magic\" set in Japanese, traditional Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese, which was printed primarily for the Brazilian market. Korean and Chinese \"Fourth Edition\" cards have been made with black borders, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish cards exist with white and black borders.\n\n\"Fourth Edition\" included the beveled border missing from the previous core set, \"Revised\". The colors were also much brighter and crisper than \"Revised's\" wash-out appearance. This set was also the first core set to include a Wizards of the Coast copyright notice at the bottom of the card, in addition to the standard illustration credit.\n\nBooster packs, for the first time in a core set, came in packs with cropped card art on the packaging. Up to this point, \"\", \"\", \"Unlimited\", and \"Revised\" all had a common-looking booster pack packaging. The cards Brass Man, Hurloon Minotaur, Mana Vault, Mesa Pegasus, and Spirit Link were shown on the booster packs. Starter packs were also improved, with mana symbols replacing the simple pentagram pattern present on the card back. Finally, an overall red theme was given to the packaging, which would persist for \"\" before changing to green in \"\".\n\nStarter decks in this set included an additional rare, bringing the total to three. However, the starter decks contained fewer uncommons, going down to nine from the previous thirteen. Booster Packs included one rare, three uncommons, and eleven commons. \"Fourth Edition\" was the first set to offload its land printings to a dedicated land sheet. This freed up room on the other card sheets to include more spells. As a result, booster packs could now be produced without any lands, which Wizards decided to do. \"Fourth Edition\" lands were only available in starter decks. The change was mostly seen as a positive, since by this time lands were ubiquitous and players were unhappy to find a land in place of a \"real\" card.\n\n\"Fourth Edition\" introduced the modern turned arrow tapped symbol, replacing the rotated \"T\" that had been introduced in \"Revised\". This symbol was first used in an expansion with \"\", which was released in the summer. Current cards still use the turned arrow, albeit with a slightly different illustration.\n\nLike the previous core set and all core sets since, several cards were removed and new ones were added from \"Fourth Edition\". Among those cards removed were those that had attracted controversy from those outside the game. Most of the cards whose art depicted nude or near-nude humanoid forms (including and ) were excised, as were many that had overtly religious themes (including and ), though one demon, , remained. One card, Unholy Strength had its artwork altered to remove a flaming inverted pentagram in the background (as compared to this). Also removed were the original ten \"dual lands\" (one for each pair of ). With the ability to tap for one mana of either of two colors, they were deemed too powerful. A number of other cards would also be pruned from the set for being too powerful, but some (such as ) would appear in future sets.\n\nWizards has used Cartamundi as their card printer since \"\". For some undocumented reason, during the production of \"4th Edition\", the company experimented with using other vendors. Some cards were printed by the United States Playing Card Corporation, and had a thicker stock along with a glossy overcoat on the back. While these cards were not intended to be released, some starter packs were leaked out into public circulation. The cards do not glow under blacklight, unlike normal cards, and did not have the normal dot design on the back.\n\n\nFifth Edition was the seventeenth \"Magic: The Gathering\" set, released in March 1997. It contained 449 cards, counting multiple illustrations of the basic lands, making it the largest card set in the game's history. It was the first edition of the core set to reprint cards from \"\", \"\", and \"\".\n\nLike its predecessors, \"\" and \"\" Editions, \"Fifth Edition\" made numerous changes to the game's rules and card mix. The set's designers stated in \"The Duelist\" that they wanted to prune from the base set cards that were too powerful or too weak. Many overpowered cards from \"Limited\" and \"Unlimited\" Editions that had survived the past two rotations were removed from \"Fifth\", but a handful, including , still survived. Unlike its predecessors, though, \"Fifth Edition\" also removed many cards that \"Magic\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Design and Development team saw as just a little bit too good, but not quite so powerful as to heavily disrupt tournaments, including , , and . Many of these cards were brought back in later sets after the designers had re-evaluated their impact on play. A few cards that were in \"\" but had been cut from \"\" were brought back as well.\n\n\"Fifth Edition\" also set a new precedent by changing the artwork and/or flavor text on many cards, especially the five basic lands, each of which was given four new illustrations to replace its original three. This was done so that WotC would not have to continue to pay for the use of many arts done for earlier sets, as originally artists were paid royalties for their artwork being used, instead of a flat fee as is done today for new Magic art.\n\n\"Fifth Edition\" was the first version of the base set to reprint cards from the \"\" and \"\" expansion sets; it also reprinted more cards from those sets than any other version of the base set has. Because those expansion sets were perceived by some players as weak, there was some dissatisfaction with the \"Fifth Edition\" card mix. However, many of the reprinted cards were good enough to be used in tournaments, and at least one \"Ice Age\" card, , was later considered so overpowered as to merit banning from a number of sanctioned tournament formats.\n\n\"Fifth Edition\" was the first version of the base set to use the cosmetic changes that were introduced in the \"\" expansion (including a slightly expanded text box and bolder, more visible power/toughness numbers) It was also the last version of the base set to use what are sometimes referred to as the \"old rules\". The rules were drastically changed in \"\".\nSixth Edition, also known as Classic, was released on April 27, 1999. It contains 350 cards including both reprints of cards from previous core sets as well as new reprints from expansion sets through the \"Weatherlight\" expansion. The name \"Classic\" was prominently featured on cases of packs of the set, and the set was referred to by both titles by both Wizards of the Coast and players.\n\n\"Sixth Edition\" was the first base set to have its artist information centered on the card (a printing practice started in \"\"). It was also the first base set to have collectors' numbers (which also originated in \"Exodus\"). The rules text on basic lands was also replaced with just a mana symbol, as featured in the \"\" starter sets of 1997 and 1998.\n\nPerhaps the biggest cosmetic change to the base set, however, was the expansion symbol. \"Sixth Edition\" was the first core set to have an expansion symbol, which was necessary to show the cards' rarities (another practice that originated in \"Exodus\"). The set's expansion symbol was the Roman numeral VI, or 6. (This change had occurred slightly earlier in the Traditional Chinese version of \"Fifth Edition\", which used a Roman Numeral 'V' as the expansion set. The Traditional Chinese version came out notably later than the English version, by which time Wizards of the Coast had decided the feature was necessary.)\n\nThe release of \"Sixth Edition\" brought a new version of the rules. Notable changes included:\n\nSeventh Edition was a \"Magic: The Gathering\" set released on April 2, 2001. It is the only core set since the original \"\" to have introduced all-new art for every card. The set contained 350 cards. The expansion symbol was a stylized 7.\n\nDespite being an \"Advanced\" level set, \"Seventh Edition\" contained a separate basic subset for new players similar to the products that were previously offered as Starter 2000. Cards that appeared in the Seventh Edition Starter special pre-constructed theme decks did not appear in boosters. This would be the last starter level product released by Wizards of the Coast.\n\n\"Seventh Edition\" was the last base set printed in the 'old' frame; \"Eighth Edition\" introduced the modern card frame. \"Seventh\" was the first base set to contain foil cards, which were printed with black borders. It was the last base set to be released prior to the final expansion of the then-current block (\"Seventh Edition\" was released before \"Apocalypse\"). Starting with \"Eighth Edition\", the base set editions (which, with 8th, would become known as Core Set editions) were released after the last expansion of the then-current block and before the first expansion of the subsequent block.\n\nUnusually for a core set, \"Seventh\" featured a loose storyline that tied together most of the cards in a core set, a practice usually reserved for expansion sets. The story involved a conflict between the North, South, East, and West Paladins. \"Magic Origins\", 14 years later, would also feature a loose story.\n\nEighth Edition, also known as Core Set, was a \"Magic: The Gathering\" set released on July 28, 2003. Its expansion symbol is the number 8 with 3 cards behind it. \"Eighth Edition\" was released to coincide with the 10th Anniversary of the original release of \"Magic\". Every previous expansion had at least one card reprinted in \"Eighth\" that had not been reprinted in the base set before, with a series of votes on the Wizards website deciding what got reprinted. \"Eighth\" was also the first base set with a promotional card given to players who played in a prerelease tournament. \"Eighth\" features many cards from older base sets and expansions. While many of these cards were powerful during their original print run, on the whole they were not perceived as measuring up to the power in Standard at the time, known for \"Affinity\" decks powered by cards from the \"Mirrodin\" block. Thus, few cards in \"Eighth Edition\" saw tournament play.\n\nA new card face was introduced in \"Eighth Edition\". The colored frames around the edges of the card were redesigned and narrowed, boxes were placed around card names and creatures' power and toughness, card names were printed in a new font (Matrix Bold, rather than Goudy Medieval), artifacts switched from a brown background to a silvery-white background, and mana symbols appearing in the text box were no longer colored. The later two changes themselves were changed shortly thereafter; in \"Fifth Dawn\", the artifact face was darkened to be more distinguishable from white cards. In \"Champions of Kamigawa\", Wizards restored colored mana symbols in card text boxes.\n\nSeveral tournament staples which had appeared in 7th Edition, including , , , and , were not present in \"Eighth Edition\". The Circle of Protection series, a perennial core set entity, remained in the set but changed from common to uncommon. A number of simple cards, such as , were reprinted only for products directed at new players and were not present in booster packs.\n\nNinth Edition was a \"Magic\" set released on July 29, 2005. It continued \"Eighth Edition\"'s terminology change of referring to itself as a core set. \"Ninth Edition\" contained 350 cards available in booster packs, all reprints from earlier \"Magic\" sets. Similar to \"Eight Edition\", the \"Ninth Edition\" Core Game contained 9 \"starter cards\", labeled with the collector numbers S1 through S10 (there is no card labeled S6, however), which were not available in booster packs. These were simple \"vanilla\" creatures, such as , which were designed to introduce new players to the game.\n\n\"Ninth Edition\" features only mechanics present in previous expansions. However, \"Ninth Edition\" does modify the list of mechanics considered suitable for base sets. The trample and protection mechanics were included after being removed from \"Classic Sixth Edition\" and later base sets. Equipment, first introduced in the \"Mirrodin\" set, is also in \"Ninth Edition\", although it was moved up in rarity. Furthermore, all mechanics now have reminder text; mechanics such as flying and trample did not in earlier sets. \"Ninth Edition\" is also the first set to be printed using the new template for enchantments. Previously, enchantments that were played on other permanents were called \"local enchantments\" and were printed with the type \"Enchant creature,\" \"Enchant land,\" etc. With the \"Champions of Kamigawa\" set, Wizards of the Coast made an effort to simplify the type line, which had contained rules interactions that were not written on the card. \"Enchant [entity]\" was changed to \"Enchantment - Aura\" and the targeting restriction moved to the text box. Mark Gottlieb explained the changes in the article \"Aura Hygiene\". Errata was issued to make all such cards conform to this template, and \"Ninth Edition\" became the first set where the cards were actually printed with this changed wording.\n\nWith \"Ninth Edition\" came a redesign of \"Fat Packs\", special products that came with an array of both booster packs and side \"Magic\" items such as life counters. The Fat Pack consisted of two boxes wrapped around by a card box wrapper featuring new art. The player's guide was also reduced in size but was now sturdier. Also added were 6 divider pieces with artwork for inside the boxes.\n\nAs of 2013, \"Ninth Edition\" is the last \"Magic\" set to be printed with white borders. The set's premium foil cards were printed with black borders. Cards made available in Cyrillic when \"Ninth Edition\" was marketed in Russia also were black-bordered; this marked the first time a new language had been printed for the game since Simplified Chinese was added to \"Fifth Edition.\"\n\nTenth Edition was a \"Magic\" set released on July 13, 2007, replacing \"Ninth Edition\" as the core set of cards for standard tournament play. The symbol for \"Tenth Edition\" is the Roman numeral \"X.\" As part of their \"Selecting \"Tenth Edition\"\" promotion, Wizards of the Coast gave fans the chance to manage a part of the set's brand. The results gave the Roman numeral \"X\" over the number \"10,\" along with many other card, art, and flavor text choices. \"Tenth Edition\" was the first core set since \"Beta\" to be printed with black-bordered cards, rather than white-bordered ones. Tenth Edition is also the first core set to include legendary creatures (two of each color), bringing back flavorful relics of Magic's past such as , and .\n\nAs with \"Eighth\" and \"Ninth Edition\", part of the development process for \"Tenth Edition\" included allowing fans to select certain cards for inclusion in the set. This process began in mid-June 2006 and continued for 10 weeks. \"Tenth Edition\" starter packs include land cards from Magic's next set, Lorwyn.\n\nFoil cards in \"Tenth Edition\" do not have reminder text. Many use the extra space to add flavor text that does not appear on the nonfoil versions. Others, such as , simply center their existing text in the text box for added impact.\n\nThe keywords defender, double strike, equip, fear, first strike, flash, flying, haste, landwalk, lifelink, protection, reach, regeneration, shroud, trample, and vigilance are in \"Tenth Edition\". Of these, defender, double strike, flash, lifelink, reach and shroud appeared in core sets for the first time. \"Tenth Edition\" also reprinted several cards from previous sets with changed rarity, such as and .\n\n"}

{"id": "1993979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993979", "title": "Tian Feng", "text": "Tian Feng\n\nTian Feng (died 200), courtesy name Yuanhao, was an official and adviser serving under the warlord Yuan Shao during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China.\n\nThere are two accounts of Tian Feng's origins: One said that he was from Julu Commandery (), which is around present-day Julu County, Hebei; the other claimed that he was from Bohai Commandery (), which is around present-day Nanpi County, Hebei. He lost his parents at a young age and lived a rather unhappy life. However, he was known for being well-read, knowledgeable and intelligent. He started his career probably sometime during the reign of Emperor Ling ( 168–189) as a minor official in the office of the Grand Commandant (). Later, he was nominated as a \"maocai\" (茂才; outstanding civil service candidate) and promoted to an Imperial Clerk (). When the eunuch faction dominated the imperial court, Tian Feng felt so disillusioned with politics that he resigned and returned home.\n\nAround 190, the warlord Yuan Shao joined a coalition of warlords in a campaign against the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian. He had heard of Tian Feng and wanted to recruit him as an adviser, so he sent Tian Feng expensive gifts and wrote him a letter in a humble and sincere tone. Tian Feng accepted the invitation because he saw it as an opportunity for him to serve the Han Empire and save it from collapse. Yuan Shao appointed him as an Attendant Officer ().\n\nAround 195, Tian Feng advised Yuan Shao to welcome Emperor Xian to Ji Province so that he could control the Emperor and use him as a \"trump card\" against rival warlords. However, Yuan Shao refused after listening to his other advisers. Eventually, Yuan Shao's rival Cao Cao welcomed Emperor Xian to his base in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) and established the new imperial capital there.\n\nThroughout the 190s, Yuan Shao engaged Gongsun Zan in a war for supremacy over northern China. During the Battle of Jieqiao in 192, when Yuan Shao came under attack by Gongsun Zan, Tian Feng urged him to take cover behind a wall, but Yuan Shao threw his helmet to the ground and said it would be cowardly of him to hide behind a wall. Nevertheless, Yuan Shao heeded Tian Feng's advice and managed to defeat Gongsun Zan at the Battle of Yijing in 199. After securing his control over the four provinces in northern China, Yuan Shao prepared to wage war against Cao Cao and launch an attack on the imperial capital Xu. Tian Feng and Ju Shou advised Yuan Shao to adopt a slow, steady and step-by-step approach, so as to gradually wear out Cao Cao's forces. However, Yuan Shao heeded the advice of Guo Tu and others instead, and chose to start an all-out war against Cao Cao immediately.\n\nIn 200, when Cao Cao was away attacking Liu Bei in Xu Province, Tian Feng urged Yuan Shao to seize the opportunity to launch an attack on Cao Cao's base at Xu. However, Yuan Shao refused and said that he was more concerned about his son, who was sick. The frustrated Tian Feng hit the ground with his staff and said, \"What a pity that he let a rare opportunity slip by just because of a child's illness!\" In the meantime, Cao Cao defeated Liu Bei and retook Xu Province. Liu Bei fled north after his defeat and took shelter under Yuan Shao.\n\nLater in 200, before the Battle of Guandu, Tian Feng analysed the situation, advised Yuan Shao to fight a long-term war against Cao Cao and pointed out how it would work to Yuan Shao's advantage. When Yuan Shao refused to listen, Tian Feng repeatedly attempted to push his ideas through. Yuan Shao, thinking that Tian Feng was trying to dampen his troops' morale, became furious and ordered Tian Feng to be put in chains and thrown into prison.\n\nAfter Yuan Shao lost the Battle of Guandu against Cao Cao, someone told Tian Feng, \"Your talents will be put to good use again.\" Tian Feng, however, replied, \"If our army won the battle, I will survive; if they lost, I will die.\" Previously, Tian Feng was not on good terms with Pang Ji, one of Yuan Shao's other advisers. After the battle, Pang Ji lied to Yuan Shao that Tian Feng clapped his hands and rejoiced upon hearing of their defeat. Yuan Shao became so angry that he ordered Tian Feng's execution.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1993982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993982", "title": "Tripp Eisen", "text": "Tripp Eisen\n\nTripp Eisen (born Tod Rex Salvador; June 29, 1965), is an American musician and convicted child sex offender, best known as the former guitarist of the industrial metal band Static-X. He is the guitarist for Face Without Fear and a former member of Dope, Murderdolls, Fractured Mirror (Ace Frehley tribute band), and Roughhouse (formerly Teeze)\n\nDope was formed in 1997, when Eisen met with brothers Edsel and Simon Dope. Eisen brought in friend Preston Nash to play drums, and the band worked the NYC club circuit. In 1998, Dope was signed to Flip/Sony records, and Eisen moved from bass guitar to lead guitar, bringing in Acey Slade—who had first referred Eisen to Dope a few years earlier—to play bass.\n\nAfter the release of the album \"Felons and Revolutionaries\" (1999) the band toured extensively throughout the U.S. and Canada with acts such as: Sevendust, Kid Rock, Static-X, Slipknot, Disturbed, Chevelle, Fear Factory, Staind, and Alice Cooper. During this time, Eisen met Wayne Static and Joey Jordison, with whom he would later work. Eisen appeared in the Dope videos for \"Sick\" and \"Everything Sucks\", and gained much notoriety from his wild antics and stage persona. He split with the band in late 2000 due to personal and creative differences.\n\nThe debut album sold in excess of 250,000 copies.\n\nA side project formed by Joey Jordison of Slipknot and Tripp Eisen of Dope/Static-X. Circa 1999–2002. The seeds of this project were sown years beforehand, in the mind and garage of Joey Jordison, under the name The Rejects. This was long before Slipknot, and the nu-metal genre they identified with, rose to popularity. The Rejects would eventually morph into Murderdolls, and to Joey, this is no mere side-project.\n\nMurderdolls began to become more than just a figment of Joey's imagination (in 1999) when Slipknot toured with New Yorker's Dope, who had Eisen in their line-up at the time. The two bonded over a mutual love of such bands as Manowar, The Ramones and The Plasmatics.\n\nTripp Eisen said of musician Joey Jordison, \"I had spent my whole life being kind of a glam guy, but also digging the heavy, heavy music...It's rare to find someone who can relate to both, and that's what drew me to Joey. He's into Slayer and Twisted Sister with equal intensity, and there's not many people like that.\" To Tripp, there's not all that much difference between the two. Both metal and glam are escapist and theatrical in nature, and he points out Mötley Crüe and Slayer both used pentagrams on their albums. Together, during the off time from their respective bands, Joey and Tripp dug up some of Joey's old Rejects songs and dusted them off.\n\nIn 2000, they played several shows in Iowa, with original vocalist Dizzy, and also featuring a friend of Tripp's, drummer Racci Shay (who went on to play in the band Dope, and was part of the 2010 lineup of Murderdolls). In 2001 the band continued to evolve, and added another acquaintance of Tripp's, Wednesday 13 on bass guitar (whom Tripp befriended while on tour with Dope). A few more live shows followed, and the name was changed to Murderdolls. Soon after, the decision was made to move Wednesday into the frontman position. The recording of the album was moved into high gear. Wednesday brought several of his own songs with him. Then, after the album was finished, the line-up was completed by Griffin and Graves.\n\nEisen was still very much a part of Static-X, who were wrapping up their touring scenario for 2002 and imminently began writing their third album. Singer Wednesday 13, recruited to replace original Rejects singer Dizzy. The two newest members are Ben and Eric, friends of Tripp's from LA. They do not play on the record, and both were struggling musicians who felt left out by the prevalence of post-grunge and down-tuned rap-rock. They were working in shops on trendy Melrose Avenue when Tripp gave them a call. Murderdolls released their debut album \"Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls\", on August 19, 2002 via Roadrunner. The album featured Tripp's lead guitar work, and he appeared in the band's debut video, \"Dead in Hollywood\". Eisen ultimately parted ways with the band due to Static-X's recording schedule so he could fully contribute to the band's third album, \"Shadow Zone.\"\n\nEisen replaced original Static-X guitarist Koichi Fukuda. Fukuda had left the band due to creative differences with lead singer Wayne Static. Eisen did not contribute to Static-X's 2001 album machine, contributing only as a touring guitarist. Eisen contributed to Static-X's third album Shadow Zone and their fourth album Start a War. Eisen was fired from Static-X in 2005 for two charges of sexual assault with a minor.\n\nIn April 2019, Eisen announced a new project named Face Without Fear was announced through a short promo video. The group features Ken \"Mantis\" Hoyt (CRUSHPILE) on vocals, TJ Cooke (METHODICAL) on drums, and Dante on guitar. The band released Deliverance, their first single, on 2nd June 2019. FWF played their live debut in August at Newark's QXT, New Jersey, on 25/08/2019. An EP is due to be recorded during summer 2019.\n\nWhile a member of Static-X, Eisen was arrested on February 10, 2005 on a felony charge in Orange County, California for having sexual intercourse with an underage girl. He was released on bail after only a few hours in custody. Just two weeks later, on February 24, 2005, Eisen was arrested again in California by New Jersey detectives for the alleged kidnapping and sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl from Sayreville, New Jersey.\n\nUpon hearing of the arrests, Static-X replaced Eisen with the original guitarist Koichi Fukuda (whom Eisen had replaced after Fukuda left the band in 2001). On June 24, 2005, Eisen pleaded guilty of the charges in California and was sentenced to a year in state prison. After spending late February to late September 2005 in California prison, he was released and due for an October 7, 2005 arraignment in New Jersey on the February 24 charges.\n\nEisen was back in jail on December 10, 2008, following a parole violation. He was released on October 19, 2009.\n\nOn February 23, 2017, Eisen gave his first interview in more than a decade. Talking to Totally Driven Radio he spoke about his arrest and subsequent release from prison:\n\n\"There were two cases [involving two separate girls]. I had to deal with both things. And I got through it. Yeah, there was two cases. People can... It's been out there. It's been so long ago. That's why it's kind of hard to talk about it. But I'm here, I'm alive, I'm well, I survived it, and the fact that... It was difficult.[...]\"\n\n\"Horrible judgment. What happened to me was really bad judgment, terrible mistakes that I made, and I paid a price for 'em.\"\n\nIn 2004 to 2005 BC Rich guitars produced a Tripp Eisen signature model of their Wave guitar. It featured in Gun metal gray, with two BDSM closed humbuckers, his signature on the back of the headstock and the Static-X symbol inlaid 12th fret. In 2005 Epiphone produced a prototype ES-335 signature model, with EMG Pickups, locking nut, and no f-holes. The ES-335 was, however, never commercially manufactured. After Eisen's return to performing from 2017 he has continued using his B.C. Rich Wave guitar.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently the co-host, with Jackie O, of the weekday morning radio program \"The Kyle and Jackie O Show\" on Sydney's radio station KIIS 106.5.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Sandilands served as a judge on \"Australian Idol\". In 2008, he became the host of \"Big Brother\", alongside Jackie O. In 2010, he became a judge on \"Australia's Got Talent\" and also on Australia's version of \"The X Factor\".\n\nSandilands has become known for controversial on-air stunts and offensive comments. This has led to companies removing their advertisements, findings of serious breaches of the Industry Codes of Practice and Guidelines, and led to him being sacked from \"Australian Idol\".\n\nSandilands and co-host Jackie O moved to new station KIIS 106.5 in 2014 with their show, \"The Kyle and Jackie O Show\", to the ARN (Australian Radio Network).\n\nIn 2014, Sandilands made his first appearance in a motion picture in \"Fat Pizza vs. Housos\". The film was first shown in Australian cinemas on 27 November 2014.\n\nSandilands has appeared on \"The Morning Show\", \"Ready, Steady, Cook\", \"Studio 10\", \"All Star Family Feud\" and \"Hughesy, We Have a Problem\".\n\nSandilands landed his first radio job in 1992, at the age of 21, at 4TO Townsville where he was employed to drive the station's promotional vehicle. Within weeks he had declared his willingness to do whatever it took to get ahead: to work anywhere, in any time slot. He took gigs in Cairns, and then Darwin, before joining Austereo's Triple M in a Brisbane station by using a false resumé to impress one of the station's executives. In 1999, he moved to Sydney, and commenced at 2Day FM as host of the \"Hot30 Countdown\", replacing \"Ugly Phil O'Neil\", a former husband of Henderson (Jackie O). Sandilands attributes his radio career taking off to being told by then Group Program Director Jeff Allis to \"do whatever you want, just win\". Sandilands was paid $255,000 per year while working on the \"Hot30\".\n\nMuch media coverage of Sandilands has focused on the negative aspects of his personality and behaviour, notably his widely publicised clashes with and criticism of other media figures, his intemperate on-air outbursts and his alleged \"out of control\" ego. In September 2006, Sandilands was named the most hated Australian identity in a \"Zoo Weekly\" article, although on 14 October 2006, Sandilands and Henderson were named \"Best On-Air Team\" at the Australian Commercial Radio Awards. Sandilands and Jackie O were again named \"Best On-Air Team\" at the Australian Commercial Radio Awards in 2007, 2011, and 2015.\n\nIn August 2009, \"The Kyle and Jackie O Show\" was put into \"indefinite recess\" by the Austereo network as a result of a controversial on-air stunt on his morning show on 29 July 2009. He returned to his radio show on 18 August 2009 but was suspended on 9 September 2009 due to on-air comments relating to Magda Szubanski. In the same year he was again named the most hated by \"Zoo Weekly\". Sandilands and Henderson were the hosts of the nationally syndicated chart show \"The Hot Hits\", before swapping host roles with Andrew Günsberg in December 2009, who had previously hosted \"Take40 Australia\", but left the show at the end of 2011.\n\nIn 2005, Sandilands replaced Ian \"Dicko\" Dickson as one of the judges on Network Ten's \"Australian Idol\". He continued as a judge on \"Idol\" until, just before the premiere of its seventh season, he was dropped from the show in August 2009. He was involved in a number of controversies relating to remarks to contestants as his stint as a judge. In October 2005, he referred to the eventual 2005 \"Idol\" winner Kate DeAraugo's arms as \"tuckshop lady arms\". In September 2006, Sandilands told 2006 runner-up contestant Jessica Mauboy to lose her \"jelly belly\". A year later, Sandilands referred to contestant Bobby Flynn as a \"mong\" – a derogatory slang term for mongoloid, referring to people suffering from Down syndrome. Sandilands claimed that he meant no disrespect to those with Down syndrome. On 3 August 2009, Network Ten issued a press statement announcing that Sandilands had been sacked from \"Australian Idol\", citing the network's view that the \"Kyle and Jackie O Show's\" content was incompatible with the family-oriented image of \"Idol\".\n\nIn 2002, Sandilands competed in the only Australian series of \"Celebrity Big Brother\". He finished 3rd on day 23.\n\nOn 14 July 2008, two weeks before the season finale, Sandilands appeared on the 2007 Australian season of \"Big Brother\". In an attempt to boost poor ratings and to promote the 2007 season of \"Australian Idol\", Sandilands entered the Gold Coast compound and was due to conduct his radio program in house on that Monday morning. However, after a heated verbal exchange with Big Brother, Sandilands reportedly required anti-nausea injections for migraines and began vomiting every 30 minutes. He left the house soon after. In 2008, Sandilands and Henderson became the hosts of the 2008 season of \"Big Brother\" replacing Gretel Killeen. The ratings for the launch of the 2008 series were the lowest in the show's history, and Network Ten ultimately confirmed that it would not continue past the current season.\n\nIn January 2010, it was announced that Sandilands and Brian McFadden would be the new judges on the fourth season of \"Australia's Got Talent\", replacing former judges Tom Burlinson and Red Symons. During one of the show's auditions, Sandilands was involved in another controversy relating to a contestant on the show. He had asked contestant Heather Cook, \"Are you male or female?\" When Cook tried to make light of the question, Sandilands then made a joke about her weight, saying, \"You're a belly full of laughs\". Sandilands added he wasn't hired to be \"bland and boring\", and that he was just being honest.\n\nIn May 2010, it was announced that Sandilands would become one of the new judges as also the fourth judge on the second season of \"The X Factor Australia\", alongside other new judges Ronan Keating, Guy Sebastian and Natalie Imbruglia who replaced John Reid, Mark Holden and Kate Ceberano. On 16 March 2011, Sandilands announced on his breakfast radio show that he would not be returning as a judge in the third series of \"The X Factor\". He was replaced by Mel B.\n\nIn 2017, Sandilands narrated the reality television program \"Meet the Hockers\", a show similar to \"Pawn Stars\", which he also produced. The series debuted on 9Go! on 16 May 2017, and attracted very low ratings of just 98,000 viewers, being beaten by numerous other multichannel programs in the same timeslot.\n\nIn 2018, Sandilands appeared in a pilot for a possible television series, \"Trial By Kyle\", on Network Ten. The reality show is set in a court room with Sandilands passing judgement across a whole range of real life cases. Helping him analyse the evidence is former \"The Bachelor Australia\" contestant and criminal lawyer Anna Heinrich. The pilot proceeded to a series in 2019.\n\nIn July and August 2005, Sandilands was accused of \"cooking the charts\" by giving airplay to \"Ooh Ahh\" (a song by his then-girlfriend, Tamara Jaber). The allegations were made on TV current affairs program \"Today Tonight\". In 2006 Sandilands won a defamation suit, with the court ruling that \"Today Tonight\" had defamed the radio host.\n\nOn 2 July 2007, Sandilands and Jackie O were involved in an on-air clash with Australian music personality Molly Meldrum, who described Sandilands as \"arrogant\", \"fat\" and \"talentless\".\n\nOn 20 August 2007, \"Media Watch\" examined Sandilands' on-air comments asserting that smoking was not as harmful to people as many institutions would lead people to believe and that the statistics presented by these institutions are falsified. These comments led to the Cancer Institute of New South Wales pulling their \"13-QUIT\" advertisements off the network. \n\nOn 22 August 2007 Sandilands was interviewed by Andrew Denton for \"Enough Rope\". During the interview Sandilands said he wanted to \"punch Dave Hughes in the throat\" next time he saw him. This was in response to Hughes' reference to Sandilands as a \"dickhead\" on another program. A subsequent article in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" cited unspecified reports which claimed that Sandilands was left in a \"hostile state\" by Denton's questions about Sandilands' need to take personal responsibility for the results of his actions on air.\n\nOn 29 July 2009, a radio segment involved a distressed teenager who was asked to discuss her sexual history live on air, and in front of her mother. After initially sounding very uncomfortable with the questioning, the girl began crying and said she had been raped when she was 12, and that her mother was already aware of this. Sandilands replied: \"Right... is that the only experience you've had?\" The stunt was cut short and co-host Jackie O was quick to apologise; however, several of the show's prominent advertisers quickly withdrew sponsorships. In the following days, media commentators, psychologists and rape crisis workers condemned the stunt while expressing deep concern for the well-being of the teenager.\n\nOn 3 August 2009, Network Ten issued a press statement announcing that Sandilands had been sacked from \"Australian Idol\", citing the network's view that the \"Kyle and Jackie O Show\"s content was incompatible with the family-oriented image of \"Idol\". Guest judges replaced him for the rest of the season. It was also announced that the \"Kyle and Jackie O Show\" on 2Day FM and \"The Kyle and Jackie O Hour of Power\" would be in recess until a review was completed. A Network Ten spokesman said of Sandilands' firing: \"\"Idol\" has remained a family-focused show, even more so this year with the 6.30 pm Sunday timeslot. His radio persona has taken on a more controversial position... which is not in the interest of the show.\"\n\nResponding to his firing, Sandilands said in a statement, \"I'm disappointed at Channel 10's decision to remove me from \"Australian Idol\". I have truly loved being a part of the show.\" Network Ten had held crisis talks with advertisers in the days prior to his firing amid concerns Sandilands would damage their brands. \"Idol\" creator Simon Fuller reportedly gave Ten his blessing to fire Sandilands. It was believed Sandilands earned A$1 million of his estimated annual A$2.8 million income from \"Idol\". The suspension of the radio show was announced on Sunday 2 August 2009. The show's usual 6:00 am to 9:00 am slot on 3 August was filled by Chris Page who announced that \"They have not been suspended ... the show has not finished.\" Page then re–read Austereo general manager Jenny Parkes' statement on air just after 6:30 am:\nKyle Sandilands's management has advised Austereo that he is unable to perform his duties on-air at this time. Further, following a great deal of consideration and having consulted Jackie O and all stakeholders, Austereo has formed the view that it is in the interest of all parties for the [program] to go into recess until we have completed an across-the-networks review of the principals [sic] and protocols of our interaction with our audience.\n\nSandilands' comments about disability have outraged Australian disability groups. He called a child with disability a \"spider baby\" in 2012, and using terms like \"spastics\" and \"retards\". He said he would donate $35,000 to family of a child with disability in 2009; however, he donated only $20,000, but he later gave the full amount. In 2006, Sandliands referred to an \"Australian Idol\" contestant as a \"mong\", a term that has been used in the past as a label for people with Down syndrome.\n\nOn 19 September 2019, Sandilands commented on air that the Mother of Jesus was a \"liar who got knocked up behind a camel shed\" (a sceptical reference to the virgin birth of Jesus), among other related comments. Sandilands later apologised for the remarks; but this did not pacify protesters, who on 23 September called for Sandilands to be sacked, likening the situation to the sacking of Israel Folau earlier that year. The Kyle and Jackie O Show returned to air on 30 September 2019 following a week off air.\n\nOn various occasions, including in the \"Enough Rope\" interview, Sandilands has spoken to the media of his difficult childhood. Growing up in Wynnum, Brisbane, he was deeply affected by his parents' divorce, which happened when he was 10. At 15 his mother and stepfather threw him out of their house after he held a party and damaged their car while they were absent. He never went back, alternating between friends' houses and living on the streets. At 17 his father sent him to live in Townsville with his aunt, Jill Stevens. Interviewed in 2005, Stevens recalled for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" that the young Sandilands:used to listen to that Tammy Wynette song D-I-V-O-R-C-E and just cry and cry. He's never gotten over his parents' divorce... When he was living on the streets, he used to sit outside his father's house at night and watch the lights go out.On 26 September 2008, Sandilands married pop singer Tamara Jaber and the couple shared a house in St Ives, located in Sydney's Upper North Shore. However, on 12 July 2010 it was reported the couple had split.\n\nSince March 2012, it was reported that Sandilands was in a relationship with model Imogen Anthony. They split up in 2019.\n\nSandilands is a monarchist.\n\nOn 13 August 2015, Sandilands took his shirt off during a live broadcast of \"The Morning Show\", after claiming he has been \"fat-shamed\" by the media, and afterwards admitted \"I think I'm going to have to do something about the weight. I've got the high blood pressure, the sleep apnoea, I'm a mess.\" He also confirmed he was to have a hernia operation in December 2015.\n\n"}
{"id": "1993989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993989", "title": "Jiang Wan", "text": "Jiang Wan\n\nJiang Wan (died November or December 246), courtesy name Gongyan, was a regent and military general of the state of Shu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty, Jiang Wan initially served as a scribe, county chief and county prefect under the warlord Liu Bei, who later became the founding emperor of Shu. After Liu Bei's son Liu Shan succeeded his father as emperor in 223, Jiang Wan gradually rose to prominence under the regency of Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu. Between 228 and 234, while Zhuge Liang was away leading Shu forces on the Northern Expeditions against Shu's rival state Wei, Jiang Wan took charge of internal affairs and provided logistical support to the Shu forces at the frontline. After Zhuge Liang's death in 234, Jiang Wan succeeded him as regent and did well in gaining the Shu people's confidence and leading them into a post-Zhuge Liang era. During this time, he considered that the land-based route through the Qin Mountains used by Zhuge Liang during the Northern Expeditions was too difficult for navigation and transportation of supplies. He thus came up with a plan to switch to a water-based route along the Han River targeting Wei territories in present-day southern Shaanxi and northwestern Hubei. However, the Shu government rejected his plan as they thought it was too risky. In 243, due to poor health, Jiang Wan relocated from Hanzhong near the Wei–Shu border to Fu County (present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). Towards the final years of his regency, as his health worsened, Jiang Wan gradually relinquished his powers to his deputies Fei Yi and Dong Yun but he continued to rule as regent in name. He died in 246 and was succeeded by Fei Yi.\n\nJiang Wan was from Xiangxiang County (), Lingling Commandery (), which is present-day Xiangxiang, Hunan. He and his maternal cousin, Liu Min (), were already quite well known in Lingling Commandery before they even reached the age of adulthood.\n\nAround 209 or 210, Jiang Wan came to serve under the warlord Liu Bei, who was also then the Governor of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), and held the position of a scribe. In 211, he accompanied Liu Bei to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). After Liu Bei seized control of Yi Province in 214, he appointed Jiang Wan as the Chief of Guangdu County (廣都縣; northeast of present-day Shuangliu District, Chengdu, Sichuan).\n\nOn one occasion, when Liu Bei visited Guangdu County, he saw that Jiang Wan was not only dead drunk, but had also been neglecting his duties as a county chief. He was so angry that he wanted to execute Jiang Wan for negligence, but his chief adviser Zhuge Liang stopped him and said: \"Jiang Wan is an important pillar of society and his talents are far greater than that required to govern an area of just 100 \"li\". His style of government focuses on bringing peace and stability to the people; he does not see the superficial aspects as a priority. I hope that you, My Lord, will examine this issue more closely.\" Liu Bei respected Zhuge Liang's opinion so he did not punish Jiang Wan. However, he still hastily removed Jiang Wan from office.\n\nAfter his dismissal, Jiang Wan dreamt of an ox's head hanging on a door with blood dripping down. He hated his dream so he asked Zhao Zhi (), a fortune teller, to explain its meaning. Zhao Zhi told him: \"One who sees blood is also one who has a keen sense of judgment. The ox's horns and nose form a shape resembling the character \"gong\" (公; literally 'duke'), so you, Sir, will rise to a position equivalent to that of a duke in the future. It is a highly auspicious omen. Not long later, Jiang Wan was summoned back to serve as the Prefect of Shifang County.\n\nIn 219, after Liu Bei declared himself \"King of Hanzhong\" () following his victory in the Hanzhong Campaign, he appointed Jiang Wan as an official in his royal secretariat.\n\nIn 223, Liu Shan became the emperor of the state of Shu following the death of his father Liu Bei. As Liu Shan was still underage at the time, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu, served as the regent. After creating a personal staff to assist him in administering state affairs, Zhuge Liang employed Jiang Wan to serve as an assistant official in the east bureau of his office.\n\nJiang Wan was later nominated as a \"maocai\" () but he declined the honour and offered it to others such as Liu Yong, Yin Hua (), Pang Yan () and Liao Chun. Zhuge Liang stopped him and said: \"You left your family and home, and travelled a long way to serve the people. We feel for you. There are also people who may not understand your good intentions. That is why all the more you should accept this honour to showcase your merits and contributions. It will also highlight the integrity and rigour of the process of selecting \"maocai\"s.\" Jiang Wan was promoted to serve as an Army Adviser () under Zhuge Liang.\n\nIn 227, Zhuge Liang mobilised military forces from throughout Shu in preparation for a large-scale campaign against Shu's rival state Wei in the following year. He then moved to the staging area in Hanzhong Commandery while leaving behind Jiang Wan and his chief clerk Zhang Yi to take charge of his office in the Shu capital Chengdu.\n\nIn 230, following Zhang Yi's death, Jiang Wan replaced him as Zhuge Liang's chief clerk and was given an additional appointment as General Who Pacifies the Army ().\n\nBetween 228 and 234, while Zhuge Liang was leading Shu forces on a series of military campaigns against Wei, Jiang Wan provided logistical support by ensuring that reinforcements and supplies reached the Shu army at the frontline in timely fashion.\n\nZhuge Liang once said: \"Gongyan's ambition is to serve the State with the utmost loyalty and integrity. He will be someone who can work with me to accomplish our State's great mission.\" He also secretly told Liu Shan: \"If I pass away, Jiang Wan can succeed me.\"\n\nIn 234, when Zhuge Liang became critically ill at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains, he told Li Fu that Jiang Wan was the most suitable candidate to succeed him as regent and that Fei Yi could succeed Jiang Wan in turn.\n\nAfter Zhuge Liang's death in 234, Jiang Wan succeeded him as regent and held the office of Prefect of the Masters of Writing (). He was subsequently appointed as acting Protector-General (), granted imperial authority, and given the gubernatorial appointment of Inspector of Yi Province ().\n\nIn May 235, Jiang Wan relinquished his position as Prefect of the Masters of Writing to his deputy Fei Yi, got promoted to General-in-Chief () and received an additional appointment as Manager of the Affairs of the Masters of Writing (). He was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Anyang Village ().\n\nAt the time, as Zhuge Liang's death was still quite recent, the people of Shu felt deeply troubled by his passing and began to fear for the future of their state. After Jiang Wan took charge as regent, he demonstrated his talents and skills in leading Shu into a post-Zhuge Liang era. He showed neither sadness nor joy, maintained his composure, and performed his duties as before. Over time, he gradually gained the Shu government and people's confidence in him as their new leader.\n\nIn 238, the Shu emperor Liu Shan issued an imperial decree to Jiang Wan as follows: \"The enemy has yet to be defeated. Cao Rui is arrogant and vicious. The people in the three commanderies in Liaodong have long suffered from tyranny so they have decided to band together and break free from Wei rule. Cao Rui has sent an army to attack Liaodong and suppress the rebellion. In the past, the fall of the Qin dynasty started with an uprising led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang. The rebellion in Liaodong is a Heaven-granted opportunity for us. You should prepare the troops for battle, mobilise them and get them ready in Hanzhong. Once Wu makes a move, both the east and west will launch a coordinated attack on Wei and seize the opportunity to secure victory.\"\n\nLiu Shan then granted Jiang Wan permission to create a personal staff to assist him in administering state affairs. In April or May of the following year, he gave Jiang Wan an additional appointment as Grand Marshal ().\n\nJiang Wan considered that one reason for the failure of Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions against Wei was that he chose the difficult route through the Qin Mountains; the mountainous terrain had made it difficult for the Shu army to navigate their way and transport their supplies to the frontline. Jiang Wan then thought of switching from the land-based route to a water-based one. According to his plan, the Shu forces would construct more warships and sail along the Han River to attack the Wei-controlled Weixing () and Shangyong () commanderies in present-day southern Shaanxi and northwestern Hubei.\n\nHowever, due to poor health, Jiang Wan was unable to set his plan into motion. When his plan was put up for discussion in the Shu imperial court, many officials objected to it and pointed out that the water-based route was too risky and not viable in the long term. The main reason was that if the Shu forces failed to capture Weixing and Shangyong commanderies, it would be much more difficult for them to retreat back to Shu along the Han River than if they were to retreat via a land-based route. The Shu emperor Liu Shan then sent Fei Yi and Jiang Wei to Hanzhong Commandery to meet Jiang Wan and present their case for rejecting Jiang Wan's plan.\n\nIn response, Jiang Wan wrote a memorial to Liu Shan as follows: \n\nIn late October or November 243, Liu Shan approved Jiang Wan's request to relocate from Hanzhong Commandery to Fu County (涪縣; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan).\n\nIn late November or December 243, as his health deteriorated, Jiang Wan relinquished his positions as General-in-Chief () and Manager of the Affairs of the Masters of Writing () to Fei Yi, thus making the latter the \"de facto\" head of the Shu government. In the following year, Dong Yun succeeded Fei Yi as Prefect of the Masters of Writing ()\n\nJiang Wan's health continued to worsen over time until he died sometime between 26 November and 25 December 246. Liu Shan honoured him with the posthumous title \"Marquis Gong\" (恭侯; literally \"respectful marquis\").\n\nChen Shou, the third-century historian who wrote Jiang Wan's biography in the \"Sanguozhi\", praised Jiang Wan for his success in maintaining order and stability in Shu, and noted that he had the image of a dignified authority figure. He gave credit to Jiang Wan and his successor Fei Yi for following in Zhuge Liang's footsteps and pointed out that in doing so they managed to secure Shu's borders and maintain peace and harmony within Shu. However, he also criticised them for not putting in their best to govern a small state like Shu and keeping it safe.\n\nThe fifth-century historian Pei Songzhi, who annotated the \"Sanguozhi\", disagreed with Chen Shou's point of view. He argued that Jiang Wan and Fei Yi did well during their regencies when they refrained from making risky moves that could jeopardise Shu's future and when they successfully countered a Wei invasion and maintained peace within Shu's borders. He also pointed out that readers may find Chen Shou's concluding remarks confusing because Chen Shou did not provide any evidence to support his claim that Jiang Wan and Fei Yi did not put in their best to govern Shu and keep it safe.\n\nYang Xi was known for being curt and terse when speaking to others. There were times when he completely ignored Jiang Wan while the latter was talking to him. Someone once told Jiang Wan: \"Sir, when you speak to Yang Xi, he completely ignores you. He is so rude and disrespectful to you. Isn't that too much?\" Jiang Wan replied: \"People have different personalities in the same way they have different appearances. The ancients had long cautioned us about people who pretend to be nice in front of you and speak ill of you behind your back. Yang Xi never intended to praise me. If he openly disagreed with me, he would reveal my weaknesses. That was why he ignored me. That's how he's being honest with me.\"\n\nYang Min () once criticised Jiang Wan for being \"muddleheaded\" and \"inferior compared to his predecessor\". When an official suggested conducting an investigation and taking disciplinary action against Yang Min, Jiang Wan said: \"I am indeed inferior compared to my predecessor. Why is there a need to investigate?\" He turned down the official's repeated calls to make a case against Yang Min. When the official sought permission to ask Yang Min to produce evidence to substantiate his claims, Jiang Wan said: \"If I am inferior compared to my predecessor, then I am being unreasonable in how I handle issues. If I am unreasonable in the way I handle issues, then I am indeed muddleheaded. Why do you need to ask him?\" When Yang Min committed an offence later and ended up being imprisoned, his colleagues feared the worst for him. However, Jiang Wan did not hold a grudge against Yang Min and even helped him obtain a pardon.\n\nThese two incidents showed that Jiang Wan was a reasonable and well-meaning person.\n\nJiang Wan's elder son, Jiang Bin (), inherited his father's peerage and became the next Marquis of Anyang Village (). Like his father, he served as a general in Shu and held the rank of General of Pacifying Martial Might () and appointment of an Army Protector () in Hancheng County (漢城縣; present-day Mian County, Shaanxi).\n\nIn 263, during the Wei invasion of Shu, when Wei general Zhong Hui and his troops approached Hancheng County, he wrote a letter to Jiang Bin as follows: \"There are many talented and virtuous people in Shu. People like you and Zhuge Siyuan are like me and there are so many others like you too. It has been our ancestors' practice to pay respects to great sages of the past. Today, when I come to Shu, I want to visit your father's tomb, clean it up, and pay my respects to him. I hope you will tell me where it is.\"\n\nJiang Bin replied: \"I know that you are someone who understands me and I hope to become friends with you. Now that you have made such a polite request, it would be rude of me to reject you. My late father fell sick and passed away in Fu County. After the fengshui masters said that Fu County was a good location, we had him buried there. Sir, you came all the way to Shu for the purpose of visiting his tomb and paying your respects. Yan Hui also showed his virtuous character when he treated Confucius like his father. Now, after receiving your letter, I feel deeply saddened and I miss my father even more.\"\n\nZhong Hui felt impressed by Jiang Bin's honourable character after receiving his reply. He then headed to Fu County, found Jiang Wan's tomb, and paid his respects there. After the fall of Shu in late 263, Jiang Bin went to Fu County to meet Zhong Hui and became friends with him. He was killed by mutinying soldiers in March 264 when Zhong Hui started a rebellion in Chengdu against the Wei regent Sima Zhao.\n\nJiang Wan's younger son, Jiang Xian (), served as an attendant to the Shu crown prince Liu Xuan. Zhong Hui also appreciated Jiang Xian for his talent and befriended him as well. Jiang Xian died together with his brother during the chaos caused by Zhong Hui's rebellion in March 264.\n\n\n"}

In the 2000 Canadian federal election, Laframboise was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Bloc Québécois candidate in the riding of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel. He was easily re-elected in the 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections, however he was defeated in the 2011 election by NDP's Mylène Freeman. A former notary, he was the Bloc critic to the Minister of Transport and later to the Minister of Infrastructure. He was also vice-president of the federal permanent committee of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.\n\nLaframboise was the Coalition Avenir Québec candidate for the June 11, 2012 by-election in the provincial riding of Argenteuil. He came in third. He was again defeated by Richer in the 2012 general election. In the 2014 general election he switched to the riding of Blainville, where he was elected.\n\nDuring his tenure as MP his priorities were centered on the local economy which is especially dominated by the forestry, tourism and agriculture sectors especially in the Petite-Nation region. When the Conservative government of Stephen Harper was elected to power after the 2006 election, Laframboise urged them to adopt a motion by the Bloc Québécois that would have modified the Employment Insurance Bill which would have helped workers who've lost their jobs - at that time a local Thurso sawmill closed in early 2006.\n\nHe mentioned that the Conservatives had promised during the election to create an independent employment insurance program. The MP and his party also wanted measures to help more aged workers when they lost their jobs.\n\nDespite its support over the Kyoto Accord, Laframboise also supported the completion of Autoroute 50 between Gatineau and Lachute in the Laurentians which has been planned for years in order to provide an alternative way to the dangerous Route 148 which was the scene of numerous fatal accidents over the years in the Petite-Nation region. During his mandates, he criticized the lack of participation of the federal government (during the Liberal era) over the construction of it. However, the lack of funding forced the Quebec government to build only a Super-2 highway, while Laframboise wanted a four-lane traditional Autoroute to facilitated a triangular corridor formed by Montreal, Gatineau and the Mont-Tremblant ski resort in the Laurentians. He mentioned that a two-lane highway would become as dangerous as the Route 175 that crossed the Laurentians Wildlife Reserve north of Quebec City.\n"}
{"id": "1993994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993994", "title": "Operations management", "text": "Operations management\n\nOperations management is an area of management concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. It involves the responsibility of ensuring that business operations are efficient in terms of using as few resources as needed and effective in terms of meeting customer requirements. Operations management is primarily concerned with planning, organizing and supervising in the contexts of production, manufacturing or the provision of services. \n\nIt is concerned with managing an entire production or service system which is the process that converts inputs (in the forms of raw materials, labor, consumers, and energy) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services for consumers). Operations produce products, manage quality and create services. Operation management covers sectors like banking systems, hospitals, companies, working with suppliers, customers, and using technology. Operations is one of the major functions in an organization along with supply chains, marketing, finance and human resources. The operations function requires management of both the strategic and day-to-day production of goods and services.\n\nIn managing manufacturing or service operations several types of decisions are made including operations strategy, product design, process design, quality management, capacity, facilities planning, production planning and inventory control. Each of these requires an ability to analyze the current situation and find better solutions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of manufacturing or service operations.\n\nThe history of production and operation systems began around 5000 B.C. when Sumerian priests developed the ancient system of recording inventories, loans, taxes, and business transactions. The next major historical application of operation systems occurred in 4000 B.C. It was during this time that the Egyptians started using planning, organization, and control in large projects such as the construction of the pyramids. By 1100 B.C., labor was being specialized in China; by about 370 B.C., Xenophon described the advantages of dividing the various operations necessary for the production of shoes among different individuals in ancient Greece:\n\nIn the Middle Ages, kings and queens ruled over large areas of land. Loyal noblemen maintained large sections of the monarch's territory. This hierarchical organization in which people were divided into classes based on social position and wealth became known as the feudal system. In the feudal system, vassals and serfs produced for themselves and people of higher classes by using the ruler's land and resources. Although a large part of labor was employed in agriculture, artisans contributed to economic output and formed guilds. The guild system, operating mainly between 1100 and 1500, consisted of two types: merchant guilds, who bought and sold goods, and craft guilds, which made goods. Although guilds were regulated as to the quality of work performed, the resulting system was rather rigid, shoemakers, for example, were prohibited from tanning hides.\n\nServices were also performed in the Middle Ages by servants. They provided service to the nobility in the form of cooking, cleaning and providing entertainment. Court jesters were considered service providers. The medieval army could also be considered a service since they defended the nobility.\n\nThe industrial revolution was facilitated by two elements: interchangeability of parts and division of labor. Division of labor has been a feature from the beginning of civilization, the extent to which the division is carried out varied considerably depending on period and location. Compared to the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery were characterized by a greater specialization in labor, which was a characteristic of the growing cities and trade networks of Europe. An important leap in manufacturing efficiency came in the late eighteenth century as Eli Whitney popularized the concept of interchangeability of parts when he manufactured 10,000 muskets. Up to this point in the history of manufacturing, each product (e.g. each musket) was considered a special order, meaning that parts of a given musket were fitted only for that particular musket and could not be used in other muskets. Interchangeability of parts allowed the mass production of parts independent of the final products in which they would be used. An entire new market to fill the need for the sale and manufacturing of muskets began at this time. \n\nIn 1883, Frederick Winslow Taylor introduced the stopwatch method for accurately measuring the time to perform each single task of a complicated job. He developed the scientific study of productivity and identifying how to coordinate different tasks to eliminate wasting of time and increase the quality of work. The next generation of scientific study occurred with the development of work sampling and predetermined motion time systems (PMTS). Work sampling is used to measure the random variable associated with the time of each task. PMTS allows the use of standard predetermined tables of the smallest body movements (e.g. turning the left wrist by 90°), and integrating them to predict the time needed to perform a simple task. PMTS has gained substantial importance due to the fact that it can predict work measurements without observing the actual work. The foundation of PMTS was laid out by the research and development of Frank B. and Lillian M. Gilbreth around 1912. The Gilbreths took advantage of taking motion pictures at known time intervals while operators were performing the given task.\n\nService Industries: At the turn of the twentieth century, the services industries were already developed, but largely fragmented. In 1900 the U.S. service industry consisted of banks, professional services, schools, general stores, railroads and telegraph. Services were largely local in nature (except for railroads and telegraph) and owned by entrepreneurs and families. The U.S. in 1900 had 31% employment in services, 31% in manufacturing and 38% in agriculture.\n\nThe idea of the production line has been used multiple times in history prior to Henry Ford: the Venetian Arsenal (1104); Smith's pin manufacturing, in the Wealth of Nations (1776) or Brunel's Portsmouth Block Mills (1802). Ransom Olds was the first to manufacture cars using the assembly line system, but Henry Ford developed the first auto assembly system where a car chassis was moved through the assembly line by a conveyor belt while workers added components to it until the car was completed. During World War II, the growth of computing power led to further development of efficient manufacturing methods and the use of advanced mathematical and statistical tools. This was supported by the development of academic programs in industrial and systems engineering disciplines, as well as fields of operations research and management science (as multi-disciplinary fields of problem solving). While systems engineering concentrated on the broad characteristics of the relationships between inputs and outputs of generic systems, operations researchers concentrated on solving specific and focused problems. The synergy of operations research and systems engineering allowed for the realization of solving large scale and complex problems in the modern era. Recently, the development of faster and smaller computers, intelligent systems, and the World Wide Web has opened new opportunities for operations, manufacturing, production, and service systems.\n\nBefore the First industrial revolution work was mainly done through two systems: domestic system and craft guilds. In the domestic system merchants took materials to homes where artisans performed the necessary work, craft guilds on the other hand were associations of artisans which passed work from one shop to another, for example: leather was tanned by a tanner, passed to curriers, and finally arrived at shoemakers and saddlers.\n\nThe beginning of the industrial revolution is usually associated with 18th century English textile industry, with the invention of flying shuttle by John Kay in 1733, the spinning jenny by James Hargreaves in 1765, the water frame by Richard Arkwright in 1769 and the steam engine by James Watt in 1765.\nIn 1851 at the Crystal Palace Exhibition the term American system of manufacturing was used to describe the new approach that was evolving in the United States of America which was based on two central features: interchangeable parts and extensive use of mechanization to produce them.\n\nHenry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903, with $28,000 capital from twelve investors. The model T car was introduced in 1908, however it was not until Ford implemented the assembly line concept, that his vision of making a popular car affordable by every middle-class American citizen would be realized. The first factory in which Henry Ford used the concept of the assembly line was Highland Park (1913), he characterized the system as follows:\n\nThis became one the central ideas that led to mass production, one of the main elements of the Second Industrial Revolution, along with emergence of the electrical industry and petroleum industry.\n\nThe post-industrial economy was noted in 1973 by Daniel Bell. He stated that the future economy would provide more GDP and employment from services than from manufacturing and have a great effect on society. Since all sectors are highly interconnected, this did not reflect less importance for manufacturing, agriculture, and mining but just a shift in the type of economic activity.\n\nAlthough productivity benefited considerably from technological inventions and division of labor, the problem of systematic measurement of performances and the calculation of these by the use of formulas remained somewhat unexplored until Frederick Taylor, whose early work focused on developing what he called a \"differential piece-rate system\" and a series of experiments, measurements and formulas dealing with cutting metals and manual labor. The differential piece-rate system consisted in offering two different pay rates for doing a job: a higher rate for workers with high productivity (efficiency) and who produced high quality goods (effectiveness) and a lower rate for those who fail to achieve the standard. One of the problems Taylor believed could be solved with this system, was the problem of soldiering: faster workers reducing their production rate to that of the slowest worker.\nIn 1911 Taylor published his \"The Principles of Scientific Management\", in which he characterized scientific management (also known as Taylorism) as:\n\nTaylor is also credited for developing stopwatch time study, this combined with Frank and Lillian Gilbreth motion study gave way to time and motion study which is centered on the concepts of standard method and standard time. Frank Gilbreth is also responsible for introducing the flow process chart in 1921. Other contemporaries of Taylor worth remembering are Morris Cooke (rural electrification in the 1920s and implementer of Taylor's principles of scientific management in the Philadelphia's Department of Public Works), Carl Barth (speed-and-feed-calculating slide rules ) and Henry Gantt (Gantt chart). Also in 1910 Hugo Diemer published the first industrial engineering book: Factory Organization and Administration.\n\nIn 1913 Ford Whitman Harris published his \"How many parts to make at once\" in which he presented the idea of the economic order quantity model. He described the problem as follows:\nThis paper inspired a large body of mathematical literature focusing on the problem of production planning and inventory control.\n\nIn 1924 Walter Shewhart introduced the control chart through a technical memorandum while working at Bell Labs, central to his method was the distinction between common cause and special cause of variation. In 1931 Shewhart published his Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product, the first systematic treatment of the subject of Statistical Process Control (SPC).\n\nIn the 1940s methods-time measurement (MTM) was developed by H.B. Maynard, JL Schwab and GJ Stegemerten. MTM was the first of a series of predetermined motion time systems, predetermined in the sense that estimates of time are not determined in loco but are derived from an industry standard. This was explained by its originators in a book they published in 1948 called \"Method-Time Measurement\".\n\nUp to this point in history, optimization techniques were known for a very long time, from the simple methods employed by F.W.Harris to the more elaborate techniques of the calculus of variations developed by Euler in 1733 or the multipliers employed by Lagrange in 1811, and computers were slowly being developed, first as analog computers by Sir William Thomson (1872) and James Thomson (1876) moving to the eletromechanical computers of Konrad Zuse (1939 and 1941). During World War II however, the development of mathematical optimization went through a major boost with the development of the Colossus computer, the first electronic digital computer that was all programmable, and the possibility to computationally solve large linear programming problems, first by Kantorovich in 1939 working for the Soviet government and latter on in 1947 with the simplex method of Dantzig. These methods are known today as belonging to the field of operations research.\n\nFrom this point on a curious development took place: while in the United States the possibility of applying the computer to business operations led to the development of management software architecture such as MRP and successive modifications, and ever more sophisticated optimization techniques and manufacturing simulation software, in post-war Japan a series of events at Toyota Motor led to the development of the Toyota Production System (TPS) and Lean Manufacturing.\n\nIn 1943, in Japan, Taiichi Ohno arrived at Toyota Motor company. Toyota evolved a unique manufacturing system centered on two complementary notions: just in time (produce only what is needed) and autonomation (automation with a human touch). Regarding JIT, Ohno was inspired by American supermarkets: workstations functioned like a supermarket shelf where the customer can get products they need, at the time they need and in the amount needed, the workstation (shelf) is then restocked. Autonomation was developed by Toyoda Sakichi in Toyoda Spinning and Weaving: an automatically activated loom that was also foolproof, that is automatically detected problems. In 1983 J.N Edwards published his \"MRP and Kanban-American style\" in which he described JIT goals in terms of seven zeros: zero defects, zero (excess) lot size, zero setups, zero breakdowns, zero handling, zero lead time and zero surging. This period also marks the spread of Total Quality Management (TQM) in Japan, ideas initially developed by American authors such as Deming, Juran and Armand V. Feigenbaum. TQM is a strategy for implementing and managing quality improvement on an organizational basis, this includes: participation, work culture, customer focus, supplier quality improvement and integration of the quality system with business goals. Schnonberger identified seven fundamentals principles essential to the Japanese approach:\n\nMeanwhile, in the sixties, a different approach was developed by George W. Plossl and Oliver W. Wight, this approach was continued by Joseph Orlicky as a response to the TOYOTA Manufacturing Program which led to Material Requirements Planning (MRP) at IBM, latter gaining momentum in 1972 when the American Production and Inventory Control Society launched the \"MRP Crusade\". One of the key insights of this management system was the distinction between dependent demand and independent demand. Independent demand is demand which originates outside of the production system, therefore not directly controllable, and dependent demand is demand for components of final products, therefore subject to being directly controllable by management through the bill of materials, via product design. Orlicky wrote \"Materials Requirement Planning\" in 1975, the first hard cover book on the subject. MRP II was developed by Gene Thomas at IBM, and expanded the original MRP software to include additional production functions. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is the modern software architecture, which addresses, besides production operations, distribution, accounting, human resources and procurement.\n\nDramatic changes were occurring in the service industries, as well. Beginning in 1955 McDonald's provided one of the first innovations in service operations. McDonald's is founded on the idea of the production-line approach to service. This requires a standard and limited menu, an assembly-line type of production process in the back-room, high customer service in the front-room with cleanliness, courtesy and fast service. While modeled after manufacturing in the production of the food in the back-room, the service in the front-room was defined and oriented to the customer. It was the McDonald's operations system of both production and service that made the difference. McDonald's also pioneered the idea of franchising this operation system to rapidly spread the business around the country and later the world.\n\nFedEx in 1971 provided the first overnight delivery of packages in the U.S. This was based on the innovative idea of flying all packages into the single airport in Memphis Tenn by midnight each day, resorting the packages for delivery to destinations and then flying them back out the next morning for delivery to numerous locations. This concept of a fast package delivery system created a whole new industry, and eventually allowed fast delivery of online orders by Amazon and other retailers.\n\nWalmart provided the first example of very low cost retailing through design of their stores and efficient management of their entire supply chain. Starting with a single store in Roger's Arkansas in 1962, Walmart has now become the world's largest company. This was accomplished by adhering to their system of delivering the goods and the service to the customers at the lowest possible cost. The operations system included careful selection of merchandise, low cost sourcing, ownership of transportation, cross-docking, efficient location of stores and friendly home-town service to the customer.\n\nIn 1987 the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), recognizing the growing importance of quality, issued the ISO 9000, a family of standards related to quality management systems. There standards apply to both manufacturing and service organizations. There has been some controversy regarding the proper procedures to follow and the amount of paperwork involved, but much of that has improved in current ISO 9000 revisions.\n\nWith the coming of the Internet, in 1994 Amazon devised a service system of on-line retailing and distribution. With this innovative system customers were able to search for products they might like to buy, enter the order for the product, pay online, and track delivery of the product to their location, all in two days. This required not only very large computer operations, but dispersed warehouses, and an efficient transportation system. Service to customers including a high merchandise assortment, return services of purchases, and fast delivery is at the forefront of this business. It is the customer being in the system during the production and delivery of the service that distinguishes all services from manufacturing.\n\nRecent trends in the field revolve around concepts such as:\n\n\nA production system comprises both the technological elements (machines and tools) and organizational behavior (division of labor and information flow). An individual production system is usually analyzed in the literature referring to a single business, therefore it's usually improper to include in a given production system the operations necessary to process goods that are obtained by purchasing or the operations carried by the customer on the sold products, the reason being simply that since businesses need to design their own production systems this then becomes the focus of analysis, modeling and decision making (also called \"configuring\" a production system).\n\nA first possible distinction in production systems (technological classification) is between continuous process production and discrete part production (manufacturing). \n\nAnother possible classification is one based on Lead Time (manufacturing lead time vs delivery lead time): engineer to order (ETO), purchase to order (PTO), make to order (MTO), assemble to order (ATO) and make to stock (MTS). According to this classification different kinds of systems will have different customer order decoupling points (CODP), meaning that work in progress (WIP) cycle stock levels are practically nonexistent regarding operations located after the CODP (except for WIP due to queues). (See Order fulfillment)\n\nThe concept of production systems can be expanded to the service sector world keeping in mind that services have some fundamental differences in respect to material goods: intangibility, client always present during transformation processes, no stocks for \"finished goods\". Services can be classified according to a service process matrix: degree of labor intensity (volume) vs degree of customization (variety). With a high degree of labor intensity there are Mass Services (e.g., commercial banking bill payments and state schools) and Professional Services (e.g., personal physicians and lawyers), while with a low degree of labor intensity there are Service Factories (e.g., airlines and hotels) and Service Shops (e.g., hospitals and auto mechanics).\n\nThe systems described above are ideal types: real systems may present themselves as hybrids of those categories. Consider, for example, that the production of jeans involves initially carding, spinning, dyeing and weaving, then cutting the fabric in different shapes and assembling the parts in pants or jackets by combining the fabric with thread, zippers and buttons, finally finishing and distressing the pants/jackets before being shipped to stores. The beginning can be seen as process production, the middle as part production and the end again as process production: it's unlikely that a single company will keep all the stages of production under a single roof, therefore the problem of vertical integration and outsourcing arises. Most products require, \"from a supply chain perspective\", both process production and part production.\n\nOperations strategy concerns policies and plans of use of the firm productive resources with the aim of supporting long term competitive strategy. Metrics in operations management can be broadly classified into efficiency metrics and effectiveness metrics. Effectiveness metrics involve: \n\nA more recent approach, introduced by Terry Hill, involves distinguishing competitive variables in order winner and order qualifiers when defining operations strategy. Order winners are variables which permit differentiating the company from competitors, while order qualifiers are prerequisites for engaging in a transaction. This view can be seen as a unifying approach between operations management and marketing (see segmentation and positioning).\n\nProductivity is a standard efficiency metric for evaluation of production systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume many specific forms, for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=inventory turnover). It is also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total time) and yield η (ratio between produced volume and productive time) to better evaluate production systems performances. Cycle times can be modeled through manufacturing engineering if the individual operations are heavily automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include: time and motion study, predetermined motion time systems and work sampling.\n\nABC analysis is a method for analyzing inventory based on Pareto distribution, it posits that since revenue from items on inventory will be power law distributed then it makes sense to manage items differently based on their position on a revenue-inventory level matrix, 3 classes are constructed (A, B and C) from cumulative item revenues, so in a matrix each item will have a letter (A, B or C) assigned for revenue and inventory. This method posits that items away from the diagonal should be managed differently: items in the upper part are subject to risk of obsolescence, items in the lower part are subject to risk of stockout.\n\nThroughput is a variable which quantifies the number of parts produced in the unit of time. Although estimating throughput for a single process maybe fairly simple, doing so for an entire production system involves an additional difficulty due to the presence of queues which can come from: machine breakdowns, processing time variability, scraps, setups, maintenance time, lack of orders, lack of materials, strikes, bad coordination between resources, mix variability, plus all these inefficiencies tend to compound depending on the nature of the production system. One important example of how system throughput is tied to system design are bottlenecks: in job shops bottlenecks are typically dynamic and dependent on scheduling while on transfer lines it makes sense to speak of \"the bottleneck\" since it can be univocally associated with a specific station on the line. This leads to the problem of how to define capacity measures, that is an estimation of the maximum output of a given production system, and capacity utilization.\n\nOverall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is defined as the product between system availability, cycle time efficiency and quality rate. OEE is typically used as key performance indicator (KPI) in conjunction with the lean manufacturing approach.\n\nDesigning the \"configuration of production systems\" involves both technological and organizational variables. Choices in production technology involve: dimensioning capacity, fractioning capacity, capacity location, outsourcing processes, process technology, automation of operations, trade-off between volume and variety (see Hayes-Wheelwright matrix). Choices in the organizational area involve: defining worker skills and responsibilities, team coordination, worker incentives and information flow.\n\nRegarding \"production planning\", there is a basic distinction between the push approach and the pull approach, with the later including the singular approach of just in time. Pull means that the production system authorizes production based on inventory level; push means that production occurs based on demand (forecasted or present, that is purchase orders). An individual production system can be both push and pull; for example activities before the CODP may work under a pull system, while activities after the CODP may work under a push system.\n\nRegarding the traditional pull approach to inventory control, a number of techniques have been developed based on the work of Ford W. Harris (1913), which came to be known as the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning of inventory theory, which includes the Wagner-Within procedure, the newsvendor model, base stock model and the Fixed Time Period model. These models usually involve the calculation of cycle stocks and buffer stocks, the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model only in that it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.\n\nJoseph Orlickly and others at IBM developed a push approach to inventory control and production planning, now known as material requirements planning (MRP), which takes as input both the master production schedule (MPS) and the bill of materials (BOM) and gives as output a schedule for the materials (components) needed in the production process. MRP therefore is a planning tool to manage purchase orders and production orders (also called jobs).\n\nThe MPS can be seen as a kind of aggregate planning for production coming in two fundamentally opposing varieties: plans which try to chase demand and level plans which try to keep uniform capacity utilization. Many models have been proposed to solve MPS problems:\n\nMRP can be briefly described as a 3s procedure: sum (different orders), split (in lots), shift (in time according to item lead time). To avoid an \"explosion\" of data processing in MRP (number of BOMs required in input) planning bills (such as family bills or super bills) can be useful since they allow a rationalization of input data into common codes.\nMRP had some notorious problems such as infinite capacity and fixed lead times, which influenced successive modifications of the original software architecture in the form of MRP II, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and advanced planning and scheduling (APS).\n\nIn this context problems of scheduling (sequencing of production), loading (tools to use), part type selection (parts to work on) and applications of operations research have a significant role to play.\n\nLean manufacturing is an approach to production which arose in Toyota between the end of World War II and the seventies. It comes mainly from the ideas of Taiichi Ohno and Toyoda Sakichi which are centered on the complementary notions of just in time and autonomation (jidoka), all aimed at reducing waste (usually applied in PDCA style). Some additional elements are also fundamental: production smoothing (Heijunka), capacity buffers, setup reduction, cross-training and plant layout.\n\nA series of tools have been developed mainly with the objective of replicating Toyota success: a very common implementation involves small cards known as kanbans; these also come in some varieties: reorder kanbans, alarm kanbans, triangular kanbans, etc. In the classic kanban procedure with one card:\n\nThe two-card kanban procedure differs a bit:\n\nSince the number of kanbans in the production system is set by managers as a constant number, the kanban procedure works as WIP controlling device, which for a given arrival rate, per Little's law, works as a lead time controlling device.\n\nIn Toyota the TPS represented more of a philosophy of production than a set of specific lean tools, the latter would include: \n\nSeen more broadly, JIT can include methods such as: product standardization and modularity, group technology, total productive maintenance, job enlargement, job enrichment, flat organization and vendor rating (JIT production is very sensitive to replenishment conditions).\n\nIn heavily automated production systems production planning and information gathering may be executed via the control system, attention should be paid however to avoid problems such as deadlocks, as these can lead to productivity losses.\n\nProject Production Management (PPM) applies the concepts of operations management to the execution of delivery of capital projects by viewing the sequence of activities in a project as a production system. Operations managements principles of variability reduction and management are applied by buffering through a combination of capacity, time and inventory.\n\nService industries are a major part of economic activity and employment in all industrialized countries comprising 80 percent of employment and GDP in the U.S. Operations management of these services, as distinct from manufacturing, has been developing since the 1970s through publication of unique practices and academic research. Please note that this section does not particularly include \"Professional Services Firms\" and the professional services practiced from this expertise (specialized training and education within).\n\nAccording to Fitzsimmons, Fitzsimmons and Bordoloi (2014) differences between manufactured goods and services are as follows:\nThese four comparisons indicate how management of service operations are quite different from manufacturing regarding such issues as capacity requirements (highly variable), quality assurance (hard to quantify), location of facilities (dispersed), and interaction with the customer during delivery of the service (product and process design).\n\nWhile there are differences there are also many similarities. For example, quality management approaches used in manufacturing such as the Baldrige Award, and Six Sigma have been widely applied to services. Likewise, lean service principles and practices have also been applied in service operations. The important difference being the customer is in the system while the service is being provided and needs to be considered when applying these practices.\n\nOne important difference is service recovery. When an error occurs in service delivery, the recovery must be delivered on the spot by the service provider. If a waiter in a restaurant spills soup on the customer's lap, then the recovery could include a free meal and a promise of free dry cleaning. Another difference is in planning capacity. Since the product cannot be stored, the service facility must be managed to peak demand which requires more flexibility than manufacturing. Location of facilities must be near the customers and scale economics can be lacking. Scheduling must consider the customer can be waiting in line. Queuing theory has been devised to assist in design of service facilities waiting lines. Revenue management is important for service operations, since empty seats on an airplane are lost revenue when the plane departs and cannot be stored for future use.\n\nThere are also fields of mathematical theory which have found applications in the field of operations management such as operations research: mainly mathematical optimization problems and queue theory. Queue theory is employed in modelling queue and processing times in production systems while mathematical optimization draws heavily from multivariate calculus and linear algebra. Queue theory is based on Markov chains and stochastic processes. Computations of safety stocks are usually based on modeling demand as a normal distribution and MRP and some inventory problems can be formulated using optimal control.\n\nWhen analytical models are not enough, managers may resort to using simulation. Simulation has been traditionally done through the discrete event simulation paradigm, where the simulation model possesses a state which can only change when a discrete event happens, which consists of a clock and list of events. The more recent transaction-level modeling paradigm consists of a set of resources and a set of transactions: transactions move through a network of resources (nodes) according to a code, called a process.\n\nSince real production processes are always affected by disturbances in both inputs and outputs, many companies implement some form of quality management or quality control. The Seven Basic Tools of Quality designation provides a summary of commonly used tools:\n\n\nThese are used in approaches like total quality management and Six Sigma. Keeping quality under control is relevant to both increasing customer satisfaction and reducing processing waste.\n\nOperations management textbooks usually cover demand forecasting, even though it is not strictly speaking an operations problem, because demand is related to some production systems variables. For example, a classic approach in dimensioning safety stocks requires calculating the standard deviation of forecast errors. Demand forecasting is also a critical part of push systems, since order releases have to be planned ahead of actual clients’ orders. Also, any serious discussion of capacity planning involves adjusting company outputs with market demands.\n\nOther important management problems involve maintenance policies (see also reliability engineering and maintenance philosophy), safety management systems (see also safety engineering and Risk management), facility management and supply chain integration.\n\nThe following organizations support and promote operations management:\n\nThe following high-ranked academic journals are concerned with operations management issues:\n\n\n"}

She is best known for presenting \"The Hot Hits Live from LA\", \"Hot30 Countdown\", \"Take 40 Australia\", two series of \"Australian Princess\", and \"The Kyle and Jackie O Show\" (with co-host Kyle Sandilands).\n\nShe has also hosted celebrity prank show \"Surprise Surprise Gotcha\" and appeared on the 2007 comedy series \"The Nation\" on the Nine Network. She also was the co-host of \"Big Brother\" (alongside Kyle Sandilands) after Gretel Killeen, the original host, resigned from the series.\n\nOn 1 November 2013, Jackie and co-host Kyle Sandilands announced they would not be returning in 2014 to host their 2Day FM breakfast show, which at that time was generating around 30 million AUD in advertising revenue yearly. On 29 November 2013, Kyle and Jackie O announced their move to rival radio network ARN and show on new 106.5 station, coming in 2014 with a nightly \"Best Bits\" program networked around ARN stations Australia-wide.\n\nIn 2018, Jackie O recorded a song titled \"Honey Money\" after being dared by Sandilands; it later reached number one on the Australian iTunes chart, with all proceeds being donated to Australian farmers affected by drought.\n\nJackie O originally had no intentions to become a radio personality until meeting Phil O'Neil while he was the night host at the Gold Coast's Sea FM in early 1993. At the time, she had worked as an office girl and sandwich hand at a delicatessen. She moved to Canberra with O'Neil a few months later, after he accepted an offer to join FM104.7. After initial rejections by management to have her as his 'phone girl', they finally agreed, although no remuneration was offered.\n\nSoon after, O'Neil accepted an offer to join Triple M Adelaide but only on condition that Jackie was to be his co-host and it was at this time that she adopted the stage name \"Jackie O\". When the next survey result came out, the duo's ratings had doubled, easily beating their main rivals SAFM in the same time slot. After another ratings rise in the following survey, Phil and Jackie were snapped up by Fox FM in Melbourne. Soon after, their show was networked (Hot 30) after their move to 2Day FM in Sydney. \n\nThe duo co-hosted a Network Ten music show called \"Ground Zero\" and the Hot 30 radio show during the late 1990s until the couple divorced and O'Neil relocated to the United Kingdom. Henderson's career on radio rose to new heights after she was partnered with \"shock jock\" Kyle Sandilands on the Today Network (broadcasting from Sydney station 2Day FM). The pair moved from \"drive time\" to breakfast at the beginning of 2005. They continued to host the countdown show \"The Hot Hits\" until August 2009.\n\nIn addition to radio, TV and advertising appearances, Henderson has also done voice-over work for the animated movie \"Robots\", voicing the character \"Loretta Geargrinder\" in the Australian release.\n\nIn August 2013, Kyle and Jackie O announced that they would be moving from 2Day FM to KIIS 106.5FM. By March 2014 they had more than doubled the number of breakfast listeners at KiiS FM, with their show being the most popular FM show in Sydney with 532,000 listeners, while 2Day FM lost 242,000 listeners during the move.\n\nIn 2018, Sandilands dared Jackie O to write and record a song in one day; the result, \"Honey Money\", written by Avalonia and produced by KIIS FM producer Kian Oliver (who also provided a rap), went to number one on the Australian iTunes chart (#13 on the ARIA Digital Sales chart, spending one week within the Top 50), with all proceeds being donated to Drought Angels, a charity set up to help drought-affected Australian farmers. The song was later removed due to a copyright infringement issue with the artwork, as Jackie O's face had been hastily Photoshopped onto that of Iggy Azalea's. Jackie O announced her intention to reupload the song for free.\n\nJackie O has hosted a variety of television shows, most prominently the \"Popstars\" series, in which televised auditions were held to select members of a vocal group. In 2005, Jackie O also hosted the Network Ten reality show, \"Australian Princess\", in which they transformed a group of women to sophisticated \"princesses\". A second series of \"Australian Princess\" had gone to air during the non-ratings summer period on Network 10 starting in December. No reason was given by the Network as to why it was shown out of the official ratings period.\n\nIn June 2007, she was a cast member of \"The Nation\" airing on the Nine Network.

{"id": "1994008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994008", "title": "Unconscionability", "text": "Unconscionability\n\nUnconscionability (sometimes known as unconscionable dealing/conduct in Australia) is a doctrine in contract law that describes terms that are so extremely unjust, or overwhelmingly one-sided in favor of the party who has the superior bargaining power, that they are contrary to good conscience. Typically, an \"unconscionable\" contract is held to be unenforceable because no reasonable or informed person would otherwise agree to it. The perpetrator of the conduct is not allowed to benefit, because the consideration offered is lacking, or is so obviously inadequate, that to enforce the contract would be unfair to the party seeking to escape the contract.\n\nUnconscionability is determined by examining the circumstances of the parties when the contract was made, such as their bargaining power, age, and mental capacity. Other issues might include lack of choice, superior knowledge, and other obligations or circumstances surrounding the bargaining process. Unconscionable conduct is also found in acts of fraud and deceit, where the deliberate misrepresentation of fact deprives someone of a valuable possession. When a party takes unconscionable advantage of another, the action may be treated as criminal fraud or the civil action of deceit.\n\nFor the defense of unconscionability to apply, the contract has to have been unconscionable at the time it was made; later circumstances that make the contract extremely one-sided are irrelevant. There are generally no standardized criteria for determining unconscionability; it is a subjective judgment by the judge, not a jury, and is applied only when it would be an affront to the integrity of the judicial system to enforce such a contract. Upon finding unconscionability a court has a great deal of flexibility on how it remedies the situation. It may refuse to enforce the contract against the party unfairly treated on the theory that they were misled, lacked information, or signed under duress or misunderstanding; it may refuse to enforce the offending clause, or take other measures it deems necessary to have a fair outcome. Damages are usually not awarded.\n\nThere are several typical examples in which unconscionability are most frequently found:\n\n\n\"Procedural unconscionability\" is seen as the disadvantage suffered by a weaker party in negotiations, whereas \"substantive unconscionability\" refers to the unfairness of terms or outcomes. Most often the former will lead to the latter, but not always. The existence of the procedural unconscionability without substantive unconscionability may be sufficient to set aside a contract, but the latter, by itself, may not. As with issues of consideration, the court's role is not to determine whether someone has made a good or bad bargain, but merely whether that party had the opportunity to properly judge what was best in their own interests.\n\nThe leading case for unconscionability in the United States is \"Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.\", in which the defendant, a retail furniture store, sold multiple items to a customer from 1957 to 1962. The extended credit contract was written so that none of the furniture was considered to be purchased until all of it was paid for. When the plaintiff defaulted and failed to make payments on the last item of furniture, the furniture store attempted to repossess all of the furniture sold since 1957, not just the last item. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals returned the case to the lower court for trial to determine further facts, but held that the contract could be considered unconscionable and negated if it was procured due to a gross inequality of bargaining power.\n\nIn the United States, the concept as applied to sales of goods is codified in Section 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nUnder the Second Restatement of Contracts, a party may assert a claim for relief from unilateral mistake regarding the terms or conditions of a contract or a liquidated damages clause. Relief for unilateral mistake may be granted if the mistake would render enforcement of the contract unconscionable. The Restatement considers factors such as: 1) absence of reliance by the promisee; and 2) gross disparity in values exchanged.\n\nDespite the indication of these considerations, however, most challenges to liquidated damages clauses survive legal challenges based on unconscionability.\n\nThe Restatement also has a separate provision on unconscionability at §208, \"Unconscionable Contract or Term,\" which broadly allows a court to limit the application of an unconscionable term or contract in order to avoid an unconscionable result.\n\n\"Inequality of bargaining power\" is a term used in English law to express essentially the same idea as unconscionability, which can in turn be further broken down into cases on duress, undue influence and exploitation of weakness. In these cases, where someone's consent to a bargain was only procured through duress, out of undue influence or under severe external pressure that another person exploited, courts have felt it was unconscionable to enforce agreements. Controversy exists as to whether a contract should be voidable simply because one party was pressured by circumstances wholly outside the other party's control.\n\nThe leading case on undue influence is considered to be \"Lloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy\"; the case is remarkable in that judgment was put forth that English law should adopt the American approach that all impairments of autonomy should fall under the single principle of \"inequality of bargaining power\". In this case, Bundy agreed to increase the mortgage on his farmhouse in order to maintain the line of credit being extended to his son's business. The question was whether the contract leading to the repossession of Bundy's farmhouse was voidable due to pressure brought by the bank. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales ruled that since the amount of the loan was already higher than the existing mortgage, Bundy received no direct benefit from the agreement to increase the mortgage amount; that the bank failed to notify him of the true financial condition of his son's business, and that it threatened to call in his son's loan if Bundy did not agree to the increase. Furthermore, since Bundy relied upon Lloyd's for the mortgage and his son's line of credit, the bank-customer relationship was found to have created a fiduciary duty; hence, the bank should have recommended that he seek independent legal advice. Lord Denning MR found that the contract was voidable owing to the unequal bargaining position in which Bundy had found himself, in that he had entered into the contract without independent advice and that unfair pressures were exerted by the bank. Essentially, the court ruled that only the bank benefitted from the agreement to raise the amount of the mortgage, and that it had exploited Bundy's weakness. The transaction was found to be unconscionable and Bundy only had to honor the lower mortgage amount.\n\nIt is notable that Denning's judgment did not represent the law in \"National Westminster Bank plc v Morgan\", in which a family home was likewise subjected to a second mortgage to secure a loan on the husband's business with Abbey National Bank. The Morgans got into arrears on the loan, and National Westminster Bank, commonly known as \"NatWest\", offered a rescue package to help the couple save their home, where they would pay off the existing mortgages and give the couple a bridge loan for the purposes of aiding the husband's business. In the limited time the NatWest manager spent alone with Mrs. Morgan, she stated that she did not want to be exposed to any extra risks, as she had no faith in her husband's business ability. The bank manager assured her that the risks were limited and did not advise her to get independent legal advice. She signed the contract, and the bank later called in the loan when the Morgans defaulted. Mrs. Morgan's defense was that the bank manager had exercised undue influence over her in procuring her signature. Unlike \"Lloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy\", it was found that there was no undue influence since the transaction was not a \"manifest disadvantage\" to the couple, and that Mrs. Morgan had not established a relationship of trust and confidence in the brief time she spent with the NatWest manager.\n\nUnconscionability is also an important element of the English law of trusts. A constructive trust arises, by operation of law, when the conscience of a legal owner is affected meaning they cannot deny the equitable interest of the beneficiary for whom they consequently hold the property as trustee. Additionally, unconscionability is a necessary element to the finding of proprietary estoppel.\n\nThe doctrine of unconscionability is well-established in Canada, where it has branched from the older and more settled doctrine of undue influence, and is generally defined as taking undue advantage of an inequality in bargaining power.\n\nIn the case of \"Harry v. Kreutziger\", Harry was a First Nations Aboriginal with a congenital partial hearing defect. A commercial fisherman, he had a grade 5 education and was not widely experienced in business matters. He owned a boat worth only $1,000, but it came with a fishing license: since the British Columbian government had ceased issuing new licenses, one could only be obtained through transferral. Due to this limitation and recent excellent salmon harvests, licenses were worth around $15,000, meaning that the total value of Harry's boat was $16,000. Kreutziger first offered Harry a check for $2,000, which he returned through his brother. Kreutziger gave him back the cheque several times, assuring Harry that as an Aboriginal he would easily be able to get another license. Harry finally agreed to sell for $4,500, but then Kreutziger unilaterally reduced the price by $570, deducting the cost of conversion of the boat license from an \"AI\" license (available only to Aboriginal peoples) into an \"A\" license. Harry then applied for another license, but was rejected on the grounds that he had left the fishing industry when he sold the boat. Harry sued to have the sale set aside, but was unsuccessful at trial.\n\nThe British Columbia Court of Appeals found there was a clear inequality between the parties due to Harry's lack of education and physical handicap, as well as the difference in class, culture, and economic circumstances between the two parties. Kreutziger's actions clearly demonstrated his power; he was very aggressive in the negotiations and was able to unilaterally modify the price for his own benefit. Kreutziger was also unable to demonstrate that the deal was in any way fair, as the price was one-quarter of the true value of the boat and license. The court rescinded the contract because of the unconscionability of the underlying transaction, ruling that the buyer was trying to take advantage of the seller's lack of knowledge of the value of the license, and ordering Kreutziger to return the boat and license to Harry, and Harry to return the payment of $3,930 to Kreutziger.\n\nHowever, severe undervaluation of property and sorely inadequate consideration in and of itself is not a determination of whether a transaction is unconscionable. For example, in an Ontario case, a property owner agreed to sell an option for the sale of his property for the sum of $1.00. The owner later learned that options to purchase property usually sell for more than nominal sums. The court enforced the contract in favour of the option holder, ruling that the negotiations over the price of the option and the price the option holder would pay for the house if he chose to buy were both fairly negotiated and that the seller had adequate opportunity to investigate the market and simply did not do so.\n\nThe leading Australian case is \"Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio\", in which an elderly Italian migrant couple guaranteed their builder son’s business debts to the Commercial Bank. At the time the mortgage was executed, the bank manager was aware of the son's precarious financial position and knew that the Amadios, who did not speak English well, were not so informed, but did nothing to further explain the situation to them or suggest they get independent advice. In addition, the bank did not advise the Amadios that there was no limit on their liability under the guarantee; the Amadios believed their liability was limited to $50,000.\n\nWhen the son's business failed, the Amadios had the contract set aside due to unconscionable dealing by the bank. The court held that the bank manager knew about the “special disability” of Amadios, referring to their advanced age, lack of business acumen, lack of fluency in written English, and their reliance on their son's [inadequate] disclosure of his finances. A special disability is one which seriously affects the ability of the person subject to it to make sensible decisions of their own best interest. This \"disability\" was sufficiently evident to the bank, as the stronger party, to make their acceptance of the weaker party's assent to the transaction manifestly unfair. The bank did not ensure that the Amadios fully understood the nature of the transaction; therefore the bank’s taking advantage of the opportunity that presented itself was unconscionable.\n\nWhile \"Amadio\" is the leading authority on unconscionable dealing in Australia, courts have frequently relied upon other cases to help define what constitutes special disability. Courts have extended the scope of what is special disability to include infatuation causing vulnerability and mental disorder. In \"Louth v Diprose\", the Respondent, a solicitor, was infatuated with Louth. He provided her with a multitude of gratuitous gifts and a marriage proposal, which Louth declined. Louth suffered from depression and threatened to commit suicide if she were to become evicted. In response, the Respondent bought her a house and put it in Louth’s name. Following a deterioration of the relationship, the Respondent requested Louth to transfer the property in his name, which Louth refused. The Respondent initiated legal proceedings to recover the property, alleging he had suffered a special disability entitling rescission of the contract. Deane J, in the majority, held that Diprose’s infatuation placed him in a position of emotional dependence which placed Louth in a position of ascendancy and influence. Louth was found to be aware of the special disability she had deliberately created and exploited it for her benefit, even though Louth articulated her lack of romantic interest in Diprose on numerous occasions.\n\nIntoxication is generally not regarded as a special disability, although in \"Blomley v Ryan\" it was found that the severity of Ryan's drunkenness, in combination with Blomley's knowledge of his alcoholism, was enough to warrant special disability. In \"Blomley v Ryan,\" the Plaintiff purchased a property from the Defendant at a very low price. During the transaction, the Defendant was of old age and heavily intoxicated which was conspicuous to the Plaintiff. After the transaction, the Defendant refused to perform the transfer of property and so the Plaintiff sought specific performance while the Defendant sought to set aside the contract. The Court ruled that ‘mere drunkenness’ is not a defence to resist a contract. However, it stated that where there is knowledge of one party that the other party is seriously inebriated and that party takes advantage of such inebriation, equity will intervene to refuse specific performance.\n\nCourts have also frequently relied upon the observation of the majority of the High Court in \"Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd\" when considering the amount of knowledge that can be imputed to a company.\n\nBased on this case, the new concept of \"unconscionability\" in general and contractual law was passed by Australian legislation, defining it in two ways: \n\n\"Amadio\" and other cases have seen a greater willingness by courts to set aside contracts on the grounds of unconscionability. This has been partly influenced by recent statutory developments.\n\n"}
{"id": "1994010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994010", "title": "External auditor", "text": "External auditor\n\nAn external auditor performs an audit, in accordance with specific laws or rules, of the financial statements of a company, government entity, other legal entity, or organization, and is independent of the entity being audited. Users of these entities' financial information, such as investors, government agencies, and the general public, rely on the external auditor to present an unbiased and independent audit report.\n\nThe manner of appointment, the qualifications, and the format of reporting by an external auditor are defined by statute, which varies according to jurisdiction. External auditors must be members of one of the recognised professional accountancy bodies. External auditors normally address their reports to the shareholders of a corporation. In the United States, certified public accountants are the only authorized non-governmental external auditors who may perform audits and attestations on an entity's financial statements and provide reports on such audits for public review. In the UK, Canada and other Commonwealth nations Chartered Accountants and Certified General Accountants have served in that role.\n\nFor public companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) has imposed stringent requirements on external auditors in their evaluation of internal controls and financial reporting. In many countries external auditors of nationalized commercial entities are appointed by an independent government body such as the Comptroller and Auditor General. Securities and Exchange Commissions may also impose specific requirements and roles on external auditors, including strict rules to establish independence.\n\nIn some countries, audit firms may be organized as LLCs or corporate entities. The organization of audit firms has been a subject of debate in recent years on account of liability issues. For example, there are rules in EU member states that more than 75% of the members of an audit firm must be qualified auditors. In India, audit firms can only be partnerships of qualified members of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n\nIn the USA, the external auditor also performs reviews of financial statements and compilation. In review auditors are generally required to tick and tie numbers to general ledger and make inquiries of management. In compilation auditors are required to take a look at financial statement to make sure they are free of obvious misstatements and errors. An external auditor may perform a full-scope financial statement audit, a balance-sheet-only audit, an attestation of internal controls over financial reporting, or other agreed-upon external audit procedures.\n\nExternal auditors also undertake management consulting assignments. Under statute, an external auditor can be prohibited from providing certain services to the entity they audit. This is primarily to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise. The independence of external auditors is crucial to a correct and thorough appraisal of an entity's financial controls and statements. Any relationship between the external auditors and the entity, other than retention for the audit itself, must be disclosed in the external auditor's reports. These rules also prohibit the auditor from owning a stake in public clients and severely limits the types of non-audit services they can provide.\n\nThe primary role of external auditors is to express an opinion on whether an entity's financial statements are free of material misstatements.\n\nInternal auditors who are members of a professional organization would be subject to the same code of ethics and professional code of conduct as applicable to external auditors. They differ, however, primarily in their relationship to the entities they audit. Internal auditors, though generally independent of the activities they audit, are part of the organization they audit, and report to management. Typically, internal auditors are employees of the entity, though in some cases the function may be outsourced. The internal auditor's primary responsibility is appraising an entity's risk management strategy and practices, management (including IT) control frameworks and governance processes. They are also responsible for the internal control procedures of an organization and the prevention of fraud.\n\nIf an external auditor detects fraud, it is their responsibility to bring it to the management's attention and consider withdrawing from the engagement if management does not take appropriate actions. Normally, external auditors review the entity's information technology control procedures when assessing its overall internal controls. They must also investigate any material issues raised by inquiries from professional or regulatory authorities, such as the local taxing authority.\n\nAuditors may be liable to 3rd parties who are damaged by making decisions based on information in audited reports. This risk of auditors' liability to third parties is limited by the doctrine of privity. An investor or creditor, for instance, can not generally sue an auditor for giving a favorable opinion, even if that opinion was knowingly given in error. \n\nThe extent of liability to 3rd parties is established (in general) by 3 accepted standards: Ultramares, restatement, and foreseeability.\n\nUnder the Ultramares doctrine, auditors are only liable to 3rd parties who are specifically named. The Restatement Standard opens up their liability to named \"classes\" of individuals. The foreseeability standard puts accountants at the most risk of liability, by allowing anyone who might be reasonably foreseen to rely on an auditor's reports to sue for damages sustained by relying on material information. \n\nWhile the Ultramares doctrine is the majority rule, (to the relief of many new and budding accountants pursuing an auditing career!) the restatement standard is preferred in several states and is growing in popularity. The foreseeability standard will not likely be widely adopted anytime soon because the cost (time and financial) of litigation would be enormous.\n\nCFOs, company accountants, and other employees are not provided the same luxuries of the doctrine of privity. Their material actions and statements open them (and their companies) up to liability from third parties damaged by relying on these statements.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1994016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994016", "title": "Sylvia (ballet)", "text": "Sylvia (ballet)\n\nSylvia, originally Sylvia, ou La nymphe de Diane, is a full-length ballet in two or three acts, first choreographed by Louis Mérante to music by Léo Delibes in 1876. \"Sylvia\" is a typical classical ballet in many respects, yet it has many interesting features that make it unique. \"Sylvia\" is notable for its mythological Arcadian setting, creative choreographies, expansive sets and, above all, its remarkable score.\n\nThe ballet's origins are in Tasso's 1573 play \"Aminta\", which provides the basic plot of Delibes' work. Jules Barbier and Baron de Reinach adapted this for the Paris Opera. The piano arrangement was composed in 1876 and the orchestral suite was done in 1880.\n\nWhen \"Sylvia\" premiered on Wednesday, June 14, 1876, at the Palais Garnier, it went largely unnoticed. In fact, the first seven productions of \"Sylvia\" were not commercially successful. It was the 1952 revival, choreographed by Sir Frederick Ashton, that popularized the ballet. Ashton's success set the stage for the 1997, 2004, 2005 and 2009 productions, all of which were based on his 1952 choreography.\n\nIn 1875, the Paris Opera chose Barbier and Reinach's libretto for \"Sylvia\". Mérante was also chosen to choreograph \"Sylvia\" based primarily on his extensive experience in the field and position as the \"premier maître de ballet\" at Paris Opera. All other reasonable choreographers were at the time unavailable.\n\nRehearsals for \"Sylvia\" begin on August 15, 1875, with only the first third of the music intact. Throughout the rehearsal period the score was under constant revision by Delibes, often with the \"aid\" of Mérante and Rita Sangalli who would each dance a lead rôle. This development of the score was a grueling process of many revisions and restarts. Mérante was especially demanding of Delibes and would regularly request changes to the score to accommodate his choreography, yet Léo Delibes made the changes requested of him in a timely fashion.\n\n\"Sylvia, ou la nymphe de Diane\", as it was originally titled, was the first ballet to be shown at the newly constructed Opera Garnier and it did so with extravagance. This approach proved at times excessive. The lavish scenery of Jules Chéret was poorly lit, detracting from the quality of the production. The costumes designed by Lacoste were well appreciated, however. In the end it was Delibes' score that saved the production. Without such highly esteemed music, the ballet would have soon drifted into obscurity.\n\nAt the age of 27, Rita Sangalli was the principal ballerina at the Opéra, and thus the obvious choice to star as Sylvia. Sangalli was described as having a \"superb physique\", but not spectacular dancing skills. Nonetheless, she was the only ballerina taught the rôle, and on one occasion the ballet had to be temporarily closed when she injured herself.\n\nAmong the first important versions of \"Sylvia, ou la nymphe de Diane\" following the original production of 1876 was a production presented by the Imperial Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia on . The ballet had been performed in Russia before: in 1886 the ballerina Antonietta Dell'Era (noted for creating the rôle of the Sugarplum Fairy in \"The Nutcracker\" in 1892) performed excerpts from the ballet at the Arcadia Theatre of St. Petersburg, and in 1892 the ballerina Carlotta Brianza (noted creator of the rôle of Princess Aurora in \"The Sleeping Beauty\" in 1890) performed the full-length work at the Fantasia Theatre in Moscow.\n\nThe Mariinsky Theatre's production was originally planned for the 1900–1901 season in a staging supervised by Sergei Diaghilev, with décors and costumes designed by Alexandre Benois and choreography by the brothers Sergei and Nikolai Legat. But differences between Diaghilev and the director of the Imperial Theatres, Prince Volkonsky, led to the project's cancellation as well as the end of Diaghilev's association with the Imperial Theatres, an event that led Diaghilev to eventually form the original Ballets Russes in 1909. Nevertheless, the ballet was rescheduled for the 1901–1902 season in a version mounted by the Imperial Theatre's \"Deuxieme Maître de Ballet\" Lev Ivanov, whose death in December 1901 caused the director to hand the project over to the noted \"Premier danseur\" Pavel Gerdt. Perhaps Ivanov's most lasting contribution to the ballet's history was the change of title from \"Sylvia, ou la nymphe de Diane\" to simply \"Sylvia\".\n\nThe cast included the great \"Prima ballerina\" Olga Preobrajenska in the title rôle and the danseur Sergei Legat as the shepherd Aminta. Also included among the ballet's secondary characters was a young Agrippina Vaganova as a nymph of the Goddess Diana, and Pavel Gerdt in the rôle of Orion.\n\nAlthough the dances of the ballerina Preobrajenska were a great success, the first performance was not. The editor-publisher of the Saint Petersburg Gazette, Sergei Khudekov, himself a ballet expert and noted for co-authoring the librettos for several ballets staged at the Mariinsky, was one of several critics who complained that the Ivanov/Gerdt choreography was of poor quality, and that the libretto was extremely slight. Another element that contributed to the ballet's failure was the fact that the direction did not allow any new décors to be created, and instead sets were utilized from works that were no longer being performed. After only five performances \"Sylvia\" was taken out of the company's repertory. In spite of this, excerpts from the ballet were included in gala events.\n\nThe ballerina Anna Pavlova occasionally included many of these extracts from the 1902 production on her world tours in a revised staging by balletmaster Ivan Clustine. In attendance for one of her London appearances was a young Frederick Ashton, whose memories of Pavlova's performance would inspire him to create his own renowned version for the ballerina Margot Fonteyn in 1952.\n\nAshton re-choreographed \"Sylvia\" in 1952. As the story goes, what sparked Ashton's interest in \"Sylvia\" was a dream he had in 1946. In the dream, Delibes charged Ashton with revitalizing his under-appreciated ballet and Ashton, upon waking, took up the task. The master choreographed \"Sylvia\" with a strong emphasis on the lead rôle; in fact he designed the entire ballet as a tribute to Margot Fonteyn, a dancer with whom he worked. Clive Barnes, an American drama critic, noted, \"the whole ballet is a garland presented to the ballerina by her choreographer.\" This \"garland\" was produced by The Royal Ballet and it was first performed at The Royal Opera House in London on September 3, 1952. Ashton also tweaked Barbier's libretto for the premiere to maximize interest in the story.\n\nMargot Fonteyn played the lead rôle of Sylvia when this version opened. Aminta was played by Michael Somes, Orion by John Hart and Eros by Alexander Grant.\n\nWhen the San Francisco Ballet opened their production of \"Sylvia\" in April 2004, it was the first time that the full ballet was shown in the United States. This production is also the only recent one not to be based on Ashton's work. At the request of Helgi Tomasson, Mark Morris choreographed it based on the original 1876 production and adhered quite closely to Mérante's methodology and style. As Morris said, \"I'm using the score and libretto exactly as they're built\". Morris's reasoning behind this is quite simple: the nature of the music is inextricably intertwined with Louis Mérante's choreography, a consequence of the circumstances of composition. Because of this, Morris's revival of \"Sylvia\" is very true to the original, more so than any other recent production. The San Francisco Ballet performed \"Sylvia\" from April 21 through May 7, 2006, after successful runs in 2004 and 2005. At the premiere in 2004, the lead was Yuan Yuan Tan.\nThis production of \"Sylvia\", the Royal Ballet's third, performed November 4 to December 3, 2004, as a part of the \"Ashton 100\" celebration, a season dedicated to the company's founder. The ballet was recreated by Christopher Newton who (from both mental and visual records) reconstructed Ashton's original choreography and staged it for the Royal Ballet. While it ran, there were three different casts. The first consisted of Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope, the second of Zenaida Yanowsky and David Makhateli and the third of Marianela Núñez and Rupert Pennefather.\n\nAshton's \"Sylvia\" was also recently re-staged by Christopher Newton for The Metropolitan Opera House, where it was recently performed by the American Ballet Theatre. Newton's version is shortened (originally the ballet included some music from \"La Source\") to be shown in two acts, with a musical break in place of the second intermission.\nThe last production at the Metropolitan Opera, as of June 4, 2005, had Paloma Herrera cast as Sylvia, Angel Corella as Aminta, Jesus Pastor as Orion, Craig Salstein as Eros and Carmen Corella as Diana.\n\n\"Sylvia\" is generally considered a classical ballet. It features a nondescript mythical setting and a late nineteenth-century score, both of which give it an old-fashioned feel. In many ways, however, it was quite revolutionary for its time. The score was and still is recognized for its greatness. Delibes' work is certainly the best appreciated aspect of the ballet for its innovation, creativity, and maturity. Frederick Ashton's choreography complements the music very well in this respect, staying true to the spirit of the original production while incorporating modern techniques and adding his own unique touch.\n\n\"Sylvia\", and \"Coppélia\" before it, are often touted as two of the first modern ballets for their novel scores. Tchaikovsky himself remarked to fellow composer Sergei Taneyev upon the ingenuity of \"Sylvia\", calling it \"... the first ballet, where the music constitutes not only the main, but the only interest. What charm, what elegance, what richness of melody, rhythm, harmony.\" While this statement may be a little hyperbolic, it says something very important about the uniqueness of the ballet. \"Sylvia\"s score is varied and rich, and it stands out, drawing the focus from the sets, the dancers, the costumes. Instead of receding into the background, setting only the mood, Delibes' score sets the action. The music of \"Sylvia\" was also notable for its new, more developed use of leitmotifs. Such a stylistic choice is characteristic of Delibes, who was a great admirer of Wagner. Indeed, echoes of Wagner's influence are quite obvious in the music such as its \"symphonic\" nature, as described by Ivor Forbes Guest in the 1954 edition of \"The Ballet Annual\".\n\nAnother interesting choice of Delibes was his pronounced use of brass and wind instruments, especially in the characteristically powerful \"prelude\". Delibes was also one of the first composers to write for the alto saxophone, an instrument used extensively in the heavier wind sections such as the barcarolle in Act III.\n\nThe prelude to the first act and the \"pizzicati\" in the third are the significantly more famous sections of this already notable score. The latter, the more famous, is a well-known example of pizzicato style. This section is, according to \"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", \"traditionally played in a halting, hesitant style that appears to have been no part of Delibes's conception.\"\n\nTchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" was written just before \"Sylvia\" was released and is generally considered one of the best ballets of the era. However, Tchaikovsky himself preferred \"Sylvia\" to his own work, calling his own masterpiece \"poor stuff in comparison\". Tchaikovsky said to Sergei Taneyev, \"I was ashamed. If I had known this music early then, of course, I would not have written \"Swan Lake\"\".\n\nChoreographically, \"Sylvia\" was also ahead of its time. Merante's 1876 choreography (and all subsequent) was considered quite rebellious for casting ballerinas as masculine huntresses, unheard of at the time. Despite such innovations, the original choreography for \"Sylvia\" was still very much of late Romantic-era ballet.\n\nAshton's \"Sylvia\" is much more contemporary, and while retaining a classic feel, it has been modernized. In the 1952 choreography, \"Sylvia\" incorporated new and interesting techniques such as the blending of mime and dance and more intricate footwork, as are typical of Ashton's works. As writer Arnold Haskell said, \"he accepts the challenge in Sylvia of coping with period music without descending to pastiche; and never once does the movement he provides strike us as modern or as 'old world'\". Gillian Murphy, the lead rôle in the 2005 ABT production, noted this choreography was very challenging. Ashton designed the ballet specifically around Margot Fonteyn's talent and skill. Thus, any who play the part must be able to do everything she could, and at the time \"the range of her dancing [was] unequalled\"(Barnes).\n\nIt is notable that this choreography features a few difficult \"pas de deux\", including a spectacular one in the third act, which constitutes the climax of the ballet.\n\n —Sir Frederick Ashton, who choreographed \"Sylvia\" in 1952.\n\nThe libretto of \"Sylvia\" is often regarded as one of the ballet's weak points. The simple plot does not allow for much acting nor is it especially gripping. Indeed, when Frederick Ashton rechoreographed the ballet in the 1950s, he tried to rework the story to be more interesting (while still retaining its classical themes) because he recognized this aspect of the ballet as a potential pitfall. Morris simplified the story — for his 2004 production — for the same reasons. He called it, \"a big wonderful mishmash of mythology and history\", so he changed it to make it more, \"clear and beautiful\".\n\nThe ballet begins with a scene of worship as creatures of the forest dance before Eros. Aminta, a lowly shepherd, stumbles in on them, disrupting their ritual. Now Sylvia, the object of Aminta's desire, arrives on the scene with her posse of hunters to mock the god of love. Aminta attempts to conceal himself, but Sylvia eventually discovers her stalker and, inflamed, turns her bow towards Eros. Aminta protects the deity and is himself wounded. Eros in turn shoots Sylvia. She is hit, and though not badly wounded, the injury is enough to drive her offstage.\n\nA hunter, Orion, is revealed to also have been watching Sylvia, when he is seen celebrating the unconscious Aminta. Orion conceals himself again as Sylvia returns; this time she is sympathetic towards Aminta. As the huntress laments over her victim, she is kidnapped by Orion and carried off. Peasants grieve over Aminta's figure until a cloaked Eros revives the shepherd. Eros reveals his true identity and informs Aminta of Orion's actions.\n\nCaptive in Orion's island hideout, Sylvia is tempted by him with jewels and wine to no avail. Sylvia now grieves over Aminta, cherishing the arrow pulled from her breast nostalgically. When Orion steals it from her, Sylvia gets her captor drunk until he is unconscious, whereby she retrieves her arrow and appeals to Eros for help. Sylvia's invocations are not in vain, for Eros quickly arrives and shows his summoner a vision of Aminta waiting for her. The duo depart for the temple of Diana, where Sylvia's love awaits.\n\nAminta arrives at the temple of Diana to find a bacchanal but no Sylvia, who will soon arrive with Eros. After a few moments of mirth at the reunion, Orion shows up, seeking Sylvia. He and Aminta fight; Sylvia barricades herself in Diana's shrine and Orion attempts to follow. The goddess of the hunt, outraged at this act, smites Orion and denies Aminta and Sylvia congress. Compassionate Eros gives Diana a vision. The goddess reminisces over her own young love of Endymion, also a shepherd. Diana has a change of heart and repeals her decree. Aminta and Sylvia come together under the deities' good will.\n\nTaken from the original 1876 theatrical program of the Paris Opéra.\n\nAct I\nAct II\n\nAct III\n\n\n\nThis list mentions only full-length or otherwise significant productions; however, there have been many performances of short excerpts, especially in London.\n\nIn the 1892 novel written by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith \"The Diary of a Nobody\", Carrie Pooter practises the Sylvia Gavotte on the Pooters' new cottage piano, 'bought on the three years system, manufactured by W.

The label of the Cutty Sark bottle is his creation. Clarke was born in Mamaroneck, New York. He resided in Seaford, Delaware.\n\nClarke's style in \"MAD\" was distinctive, showing a mastery of line and an eye for the humorous side of things. \"I was known as the \"thing\" artist,\" said Clarke. \"Whether it was a telephone or a slot machine or whatever, I would draw the things.\" \"MAD\" editor Al Feldstein called Clarke \"a singular valuable asset to \"MAD\" ... his arrival upon the scene was a godsend.\" Feldstein's successor John Ficarra said of Clarke, \"He was a great designer, and he also was a terrific mimic of other people’s styles... And if there was a problem you could give it to Bob, and he could usually solve it for you.”\n\nClarke's earliest professional job was at the age of 17, as an uncredited assistant on the \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\" comic strip. Ripley traveled the world collecting his fantastic trivia tidbits and sent them back to Clarke who drew them, captioned them and circulated them among the vast number of magazines and newspapers who carried the strip. Years later, he illustrated \"MAD\"'s occasional \"Believe It or Nuts!\" parody. After two years with Ripley, Clarke joined the army, where he worked for the European edition of \"Stars and Stripes\" and met his wife. Clarke remained with \"Stars and Stripes\" after being discharged as a civilian contributor, before eventually returning to America and joining the advertising firm Geyer, Newell, and Ganger. That job would prepare Clarke well for his \"MAD\" work: \"I learned about typefaces and layouts, how to prepare comps in the styles of many artists and cartoonists.\" Clarke was among the GNG artists who designed the box for the children's game Candyland.\n\nClarke was one of the artists who took up the slack after original editor Harvey Kurtzman left \"MAD\", taking two of its three primary artists (Will Elder and Jack Davis) with him. In his first year at \"MAD\", Clarke illustrated 24 separate articles; he would eventually draw more than 600. Clarke was a mainstay of the magazine as it rose in circulation, being one of four general-purpose artists who took \"MAD\" through the late 1950s and earliest 1960s, the others being Wallace Wood, George Woodbridge and Joe Orlando (Jack Rickard's work appeared in mid-1961, while Don Martin, Mort Drucker and Dave Berg produced more specialized topics or features).\n\nOf the Wood-Orlando-Woodbridge-Clarke quartet, Bob Clarke had the most cartoon-like style. This was exploited by the two circus panoramas that ran in \"MAD\" #41; the first depicted an old-time circus done by Wallace Wood, a breathtakingly elaborate vision of impossible spectacle. The circus drawn by Clarke was simple and uncluttered, showing small routine acts. The point of the article was the decline of the circus, and the artistic contrast sold the premise.\n\nBut the versatile Clarke was also able to provide intricate detail. In a 1999 interview, he remembered one challenging \"MAD\" assignment:\n\nLike many of MAD's contributors, Clarke occasionally appeared in the humorous photos that appeared in the magazine. His most revealing pose was for a 1989 MAD Special for which he'd been assigned to create an actual pair of men's boxer shorts with a repeating pattern of Alfred E. Neuman's face. Clarke impishly arrived at MAD's offices while wearing the underpants, and from there, it took little convincing to get him to model them on the cover of the Special.\n\nOf Clarke's 600+ \"MAD\" articles, his favorite was \"A MAD Look at the Joys of Scuba Diving,\" a collaborative 1966 piece that came together with writers Dick DeBartolo and Al Jaffee during a staff trip to San Juan. \"We wrote it underwater,\" recalled Clarke.\n\nHe died of pneumonia on March 31, 2013.\n\n\n"}

His signature \"Duck Edwing\" is usually accompanied by a small picture of a duck, and duck calls are heard on his answering machine. \"Mad\" editor John Ficarra said, \"He's exactly how people picture a \"Mad\" magazine writer.\" In 2007, Edwing told an interviewer, \"I always believed that when you choose your field, you should specialize. You never deviate. I chose 'sick puppy'.\"\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Edwing began drawing at age nine. He started making the rounds with his cartoons after leaving the Navy in 1958, receiving $5 for his first sale in 1960. His 49-year tenure with \"Mad\" spanned six decades, beginning with his first two gag cartoons for the magazine: an installment of the recurring \"Scenes We'd Like to See\" feature and a sequence called \"Nuclear Jitters,\" both from \"Mad\" #70 (April 1962). His last piece appeared in the 515th issue in 2012.\n\nBefore drawing his own cartoons, Edwing was the uncredited writer for many of Don Martin's cartoon gags. During Don Martin's final decade with \"Mad\", Edwing began receiving a writer's byline for many of Martin's cartoons, as well as new material from Martin's paperback books. An example from 1986 is \"Early One Evening In Las Vegas,\" in which a man finds that the only way to summon the fire department is to put a dollar bill in an alarm box which is built like a gambler's slot machine. With the exception of a single page of art, Edwing was exclusively a writer at \"Mad\" for more than a dozen years before becoming an occasional illustrative contributor in the early 1980s. After Martin left \"Mad\" in late 1987, Edwing effectively replaced him as the magazine's one-page gag cartoonist.\n\nFollowing Martin's death in 2000, Edwing was asked about their working relationship:\n\nEdwing also wrote \"Spy vs. Spy\" for about 12 years, as well as the \"Spy vs. Spy\" syndicated comic strip, along with his own feature, \"Tales from the Duckside.\" As \"Mad\"'s \"bizarre biz-artist\" he authored and drew 17 \"Mad\" paperbacks. He also wrote three \"Spy vs. Spy\" books and Don Martin's \"Captain Klutz\" material.\n\nEdwing collaborated with Paul Coker Jr. on two comic strips, \"Lancelot\" and \"Horace and Buggy\". His cartoons have appeared in \"Playboy\", \"Look\", \"The Saturday Evening Post\" and other magazines. Interviewed in 2002, Edwing was asked about his work outside \"Mad\":\n\nThe short-lived \"Spy vs. Spy\" comic strip was a full-color Sunday strip syndicated by Tribune Media Services as part of \"Mad\"'s year-long 50th-anniversary celebration. Charter subscribers included \"The Los Angeles Times\", \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", \"Denver Post\" and \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\". TMS Director of Creative Services Fred Schecker commented, \"We're excited to represent a comic that so many newspaper readers already know and love. It is still as fresh and appealing as ever. In fact, it's aged a whole lot better than I have.\"\n\nDon met Clair, who was known as Cluck Edwing, in Virginia in the late 1970s. They married and moved to Florida, where they lived together until her death in 2008. He created the Golden Gator Award which is given to the wives of cartoonists. In 2003, he began designing slot machines for International Game Technology, the world's largest slot machine developer.\n\n"}

{"id": "1994032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994032", "title": "Artel", "text": "Artel\n\nAn artel () was any of various cooperative associations that existed in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. They began centuries ago but were especially prevalent from the time of the emancipation of the Russian serfs (1861) through the 1950s. In the later Soviet period (1960s–1980s), the term was mostly phased out with the complete monopolization of the Soviet economy by the state.\n\nArtels were semiformal associations for craft, artisan, and light industrial enterprises. Often artel members worked far from home and lived as a commune. Payment for a completed job was distributed according to verbal agreements, quite often in equal shares. Often artels were for seasonal industry; fishing, hunting, harvesting of crops, logging, and gathering of wild plants, berries, and mushrooms were prime examples of activities that were in many cases seasonal (although not invariably).\n\nIn a 1918 article on Russian education and social structures (as of the late period of the Russian Empire, just before the Soviet Union took shape), Manya Gordon described the artel as follows: \nThe Artel (association) is another term for the collective ownership and operation of industry. It is one of the oldest and most widespread institutions in Russia. The most ancient of these is the famous fishing Artel of the Cossacks of the Ural. This association had a membership of 15,000 to 20,000 men whose work was carried on under conditions of absolute equality. The fishing-waters, as well as the necessary equipment, were owned in common. The proceeds were divided equally among the members without regard to special skill or any other considerations. The association as a whole was divided up into groups, or minor Artels, of perhaps a score of workers. Each group had its \"Elder\" who supervised the work and looked after the accounts. The various branches had complete freedom of action, though they shared expenditures and profits. \nThe organization of the Artel was much simpler than that of the Mir [village collective]. There were no written agreements. Slacking was dealt with by admonition and in chronic cases by expulsion from the Artel. No admission fees were required. All that was required was the capacity and willingness to work. A rather disjointed organization, one would say. On the contrary, it was almost militaristic in the unquestioning obedience rendered to the Elder who was elected annually. Apart from the duties he owed to the Artel, every member was a free agent. \nI have described the most powerful of the Artels. But this scheme of association was by no means restricted to the fishing industry. As a rule, small groups of men engaged in active labor organize themselves into an Artel. Although the various Artels prefer the communal mode of living, their general characteristics vary. Some associations, unlike the one I have described, do not own their equipment. In that case, by general agreement the wealthier members of the Artel, who supply the necessary implements, receive extra recompense for their property. Again, there is the Artel which is hired by an employer, or a person who supplies the capital. The Artel members share their earnings in common.\n\nIn the later portion of the era of artels, some formalized types of artels emerged, with internal hierarchy and legal agreements. By the 1960s, Soviet reality had mostly killed the original spirit of the artel institution, such that in Yuri Krotkov's 1967 memoir, the term \"artel\" is defined for English-language readers in a footnote as \"a small workshop, ostensibly co-operative, but actually under government control.\"\n\nIn present-day Russia, there is no legally defined business term \"artel\" as a type of association; however, some companies use the word \"artel\" in their name, especially in areas traditionally handled by artels.\n\n\n"}

His father had a grocery store in Moeringgasse. Following Nazi Germany's invasion of Austria, his parents sent him and his older brother Kurt to the Château de la Guette de Germaine de Rothschild, a children's camp near Paris, in March 1939. In 1940–41 he wandered through the French countryside alone at the age of 13 to avoid capture by the Nazis. Sixty-seven years later, Porges remembered, \"It was fantastic! But don't tell anyone!\"\n\nPorges was ultimately captured and interned in a deportation camp. He escaped by hiding in a garbage collection, and was smuggled to Switzerland along with other juvenile refugees in 1942. The Swiss authorities discovered them and sent all but Porges back to France; he was spared because he was the only one younger than sixteen. He remained there for the rest of the war, attending art school (today: ), receiving his \"certificat d'etude\", and meeting his future wife, Lucie Eisenstab. The two had been born months apart in the same hospital back in Vienna.\n\nPorges's brother Kurt had managed to reach England, and eventually joined the U.S. Army. After the war, he obtained a visa for Paul to come to America. He also got visas for their parents, both of whom had been sent to a concentration camp but survived.\n\nPorges's wedding to Eisenstab was delayed by a stint in the army during the Korean War. While in uniform, Porges drew cartoons for army newspapers. After being discharged, he began to establish himself as a gag cartoonist for magazines.\n\nAfter a few sales, he became a regular contributor to \"Mad\" magazine in 1971. His first contribution to \"Mad\" was the cover idea for issue #106, in 1966. Over the next four decades he contributed over 200 articles to \"Mad\". Porges was primarily a writer for the first seven years, but \"Mad\" began using his artwork more regularly in 1978; between 1986 and 1993, he appeared in 52 consecutive issues. His last feature appeared in \"Mad\" #500.\n\nThough he used different illustrative styles in his career, he is perhaps best known for an energetic line combined with monochrome wash.\n\nIn 2000 the Jewish Museum Vienna presented a double personal exhibition named \"Style and Humor\", which attracted 64,000 visitors.\n\nIn 2001 this exhibition was shown in New York.

{"id": "1994038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994038", "title": "Shredded wheat", "text": "Shredded wheat\n\nShredded wheat is a breakfast cereal made from whole wheat formed into pillow-shaped biscuits. It is commonly available in three sizes: bite-sized (¾×1 in), miniature (nearly half the size of the bite-sized pieces), and original. Both smaller sizes are available in a frosted variety, which has one side coated with sugar and usually gelatin. Some manufacturers have produced \"filled\" versions of the bite-size cereal containing a raisin at the center, or apricot, blueberry, raspberry or cranberry filling.\n\nIn the United States, shredded wheat is most heavily advertised and marketed by Post Foods, which acquired the product in 1993 through its parent company, Kraft Foods, buying it from its long-time producer Nabisco. Kellogg's sells eight varieties of miniature, or bite-sized, shredded wheat cereal. Natural and organic manufacturer Barbara's Bakery makes an all-natural version of shredded wheat. In the United Kingdom, the Shredded Wheat brand is owned by Cereal Partners, a Nestlé/General Mills company, although there are many generic versions and variants by different names. It was first made in the United States in 1893, while UK production began in 1926.\n\nHenry Perky invented shredded wheat cereal in Denver, Colorado, in 1890, as well as founding the Cereal Machine Company. In 1895, Perky received United States Patent Number 548,086, dated 15 October 1895. The biscuits proved more popular than the machines, so Perky moved East and opened his first bakery in Boston, Massachusetts and then in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1895, retaining the name of The Cereal Machine Company, and adding the name of the Shredded Wheat Company. Inspired by his observation of a dyspeptic diner blending wheat with cream, he developed a method of processing wheat into strips that were formed into pillow-like biscuits. The wheat is first cooked in water until its moisture content reaches about 50%. It is then \"tempered\", allowing moisture to diffuse evenly into the grain. The grain then passes through a set of rollers with grooves in one side, yielding a web of shredded wheat strands. Many webs are stacked together, and this moist stack of strands is crimped at regular intervals to produce individual pieces of cereal with the strands attached at each end. These then go into an oven, where they are baked until their moisture content is reduced to 5%.\n\nPerky first sold his shredded wheat cereal to vegetarian restaurants in 1892, distributing it from a factory in Niagara Falls, New York. A health-oriented publication, \"The Chicago Vegetarian\", recommended the use of shredded wheat biscuits as soup croutons. At the same time, Perky leased cereal-manufacturing machines to bakers in Denver and Colorado Springs through his Cereal Machine Company and sold wheat processors. \n\nOne of his wheat-processor buyers, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, admired Perky's manufacturing process for his shredded wheat cereal. Kellogg declined to purchase Perky's patent on it, however, considering it too weak in taste, \"like eating a whisk broom.\" However, after co-founding the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company — later the Kellogg Company cereal manufacturer — with his brother Will Keith Kellogg in 1906, John Kellogg observed the success of Perky's product and offered to buy its patent from him, but at too low a price to pique Perky's interest.\n\nPremiering to the public at Chicago's World Columbian Exposition in 1893, shredded wheat cereal was then manufactured by The Natural Food Company in Niagara Falls, New York in 1901. It became the Shredded Wheat Company in 1904. It was bought by Nabisco (National Biscuit Company) in December 1928. \n\nUnited States production of Shredded Wheat moved to Naperville, Illinois in 1954, where it is still made. In 1993, Nabisco sold the brand to Kraft General Foods, but it was still under the Nabisco name until 1999, whereupon it was sold under the slogan \"Nabisco brought to you by Post.\"\n\nCanadian production has been at Niagara Falls, Ontario, since 1904 due to nearby hydro-electric power. United States production is also at Niagara Falls, Ontario. Until recently, United States production took place in Niagara Falls, New York, but that factory was closed when production was consolidated on the Canadian side of the border.\n\nIn 1920, Henry Perky's son, Scott Henry Perky, developed a round shredded wheat cereal, which he named Muffets. The Muffets Corporation was sold to the Quaker Oats Company in 1927. The cereal is still marketed in Canada as Muffets, but in the U.S. is now sold as Quaker Shredded Wheat.\n\nThe original company opened a factory in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire in 1926 at which time Welgar was its registered trade mark, which became part of Nabisco in 1928. The tall concrete cereal silos that form part of the factory are a local landmark and are listed structures. The first 18 storage units were completed in 1926 with a further 27 constructed in 1938, in both instances they were built by Peter Lind & Company of London who continue in business today. In 1988, Nabisco sold the UK site to Rank Hovis McDougall (who made own-label cereals for supermarkets), whose breakfast cereals division briefly became the \"Shredded Wheat Company\". In 1990, RHM sold the site to Cereal Partners. Now, all Shredded Wheat is made at Staverton, Wiltshire near Bath, Somerset, as the Welwyn Garden City site was shut down in 2008. Also, \"Bitesize\", \"Fruitful\" and \"Honey Nut\" Shredded Wheat are made in the UK.\n\nShredded Wheat has a particular place in UK popular culture due to a long-running television advertising campaign. The campaign in the 1970s featured Linda Hoyle, singing the lyrics:\n\nThe \"Three Shredded Wheat\" campaign, which came later, suggested that the cereal was so nourishing that it was impossible to eat three. Even a black hole was shown as exploding when the third biscuit was sucked into it. Phrases such as \"I bet you can't eat three\" and \"He must have eaten three\" were in common use as humorous remarks in the 1970s and 1980s, with celebrities such as Brian Clough, Peter Shilton, Richard Kiel and Ian Botham all 'unable' to eat three. A later UK poster advertisement for Carling Black Label showed a bowl with four Shredded Wheat and the caption \"I bet he drinks Carling Black Label.\"\n\nAfter Henry Perky died in 1908 and the patent on his Shredded Wheat biscuit expired in 1912, John Harvey Kellogg saw that as an opportunity for Kellogg's to sell its own version of the product. Kellogg obtained a patent on the biscuit in 1915, and Kellogg's Shredded Wheat was born. This provoked National Biscuit Company to sue Kellogg for trademark infringement, attempting to enjoin him from using \"Shredded Wheat\" as a trade name and from manufacturing the cereal in its pillow-shaped form. This series of litigations led to the United States Supreme Court case \"Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.\" in 1938. The Supreme Court ruled that \"shredded wheat\" was generic and not trademarkable; and that in any case, when the first patent for shredded wheat machinery expired in 1912, the right to apply the name \"shredded wheat\" to the product passed into the public domain along with that patent.\n\nShredded wheat consists entirely of whole wheat. Two biscuits (47 g.) contain 160 calories, 1 g. of fat and 6 g. of dietary fiber (12.8% by weight).\n\n\n"}

Siegel became an Army Rifleman and decorated war hero who received a Purple Heart, Bronze Star Medal, American Theater Ribbon, EAME Theater Ribbon with two Bronze Stars, Victory Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, and a Good Conduct ribbon.\n\nAfter the war ended, Siegel enrolled at the University of Illinois on the G.I. Bill. He wrote for the school humor magazine, \"Shaft\", for two years. He became editor of the publication when his predecessor, Hugh Hefner, graduated, a college connection that would influence his future comedy career. While at college, Siegel had stories published in \"Fantasy and Science Fiction\" and \"American Legion Magazine\". Siegel graduated and returned to his family in New York in 1950.\n\nIn 1955, while on vacation in Nantucket, Siegel fell in love with Helen Hartman, an aide in the office of United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld in New York. He proposed on their first date and they were married until Siegel's death.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Hugh Hefner would enter his life once again when Siegel found work as Eastern Promotion Manager for Chicago-based \"Playboy\". Siegel started writing humorous articles and satirical pieces for \"Playboy\", \"Humbug\" and \"Mad Magazine\". He wrote nearly 300 articles for the latter, which appeared in more than 150 issues. Siegel's output for \"Mad\" included nearly 80 movie and television parodies, including \"The Oddfather,\" \"Balmy and Clod\" and \"Flawrence of Arabia\" as well as a dozen \"primers,\" and several imaginary magazine parodies on topics ranging from medicine, to 1960s protesters, to \"gun nuts.\" Siegel also wrote song parodies, including several of those in the \"Mad\" special issue which ultimately provoked a failed lawsuit by Irving Berlin and other composers which established certain copyright law protections that endure to this day.\n\nIn 1965, at the behest of composer Mary Rodgers and \"Mad\" publisher William Gaines, Siegel collaborated with Stan Hart on \"The Mad Show\".\n\nThe world-wide success of \"The Mad Show\" brought the Siegel and Hart families to Los Angeles in 1968. There, they wrote a Flip Wilson special for NBC and a pilot for 20th Century Fox producer David Gerber called \"Oh Nurse!\"\n\nIn 1970, Siegel was hired by producer George Schlatter to write for \"Laugh-In\". He later broke contract to write for Carol Burnett with Stan Hart. The team spent three years with Burnett, during which they won two Emmys and were nominated for another. Siegel and Hart parted from the Burnett show in 1974, and Siegel helped launch \"That's My Mama\" on ABC. He returned for the final season of Carol Burnett's show in 1977 and won a third Emmy.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Siegel was hired as part of a team of writers to pen a sequel of sorts to the hit LP record \"The First Family\". Titled \"The First Family Rides Again\" and highlighting mimic Rich Little, the follow-up dealt with the life of Ronald Reagan.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Siegel spent three years teaching comedy writing at UCLA before turning to acting and joining the Screen Actors Guild. He did commercials for companies including IBM and Northwest Airlines and also performed in stage musicals in the Los Angeles area. At the age of 87, Siegel was still doing improvisational comedy, writing, and performing in sketches for shows at the Broad Theater in Santa Monica, California. He died on August 20, 2019 at the age of 93.\n\n"}

It is operated as part of Florida's Turnpike Enterprise system of limited-access expressways. The Polk Parkway mainly serves as a beltway around Lakeland forming a semicircle, which along with I-4 circumscribes most of the city limits of Lakeland.\n\nAs part of Florida's Turnpike network, SunPass, E-Pass, and LeeWay electronic toll collection are recognized along with coin collection at toll plazas and interchange ramps. The Polk Parkway does not, however, employ open road tolling like numerous other toll roads in Florida.\n\nThe Polk Parkway provides easier access to Interstate 4 from Polk County cities Lakeland, Winter Haven, Bartow, Mulberry, and Auburndale, as well as providing quick routes from city to city. The road is signed east–west, although the section from SR 540 (exit 14) to the eastern I-4 junction runs nearly south to north. The control cities for the highway's signage are Tampa (westbound) and Orlando (eastbound). The Polk Parkway is a four lane divided expressway for most of its length, although between Old Dixie Highway (Exit 18) and south of Pace Road (exit 23), the highway is a two-lane expressway, with one lane in each direction. As of 2015, the toll is $1.25 cash or $1.06 with SunPass at the three mainline toll plazas and $0.00-0.75 cash or $0.00-$0.53 with SunPass at junctions. The maximum toll for any trip along the Polk Parkway is $3.75 cash or $3.18 with SunPass.\n\nThe Polk Parkway begins at Interstate 4 near the Hillsborough-Polk County line west of Lakeland. Until reaching Harden Boulevard (exit 5), the Polk Parkway passes through mostly undeveloped land. Just east of Airport Road (exit 3), the highway passes a large building with a green glass facade, which is the corporate headquarters for Publix Supermarkets. Before reaching exit 4, the highway runs a half mile northeast of Lakeland Linder International Airport—a large general aviation airport—passing beneath the path of air traffic on Runway 5/23. Between Harden Boulevard (exit 5) and South Florida Avenue (exit 7), the Polk Parkway was built along the alignment of Drane Field Road, which is now truncated at Harden Boulevard and continues to South Florida Avenue as frontage roads along the Polk Parkway. The first mainline toll plaza is located between South Florida Avenue and Lakeland Highlands Road. The eastbound exit and westbound entrance at SR 540 (exit 1) are located at the Central Toll Plaza. After crossing De Castro Road, the Polk Parkway curves to the north, passing the only operating landfill in Polk County. Along the curve is the westbound exit and eastbound entrance of the SR 540 junction, which is the location of the planned interchange with the future Central Polk Parkway. The Polk Parkway continues north for the remainder of its length. A segment between Old Dixie Highway and Pace Road is a two-lane highway; the only overpass along this segment was built to accommodate a second carriageway west of the current highway. About midway between Old Dixie Highway and Pace Road is the Eastern Toll Plaza. The Pace Road interchange collects tolls with SunPass only and was added to the highway in 2011 to provide access to Florida Polytechnic University, located on the southwest corner of the I-4/Polk Parkway interchange.\n\nThe Polk Parkway was originally conceived in the 1950s as a circumferential route around Lakeland, and after several delays in planning due to funding shortfalls, it was revived as the Imperial Parkway by the Polk County Commission in 1986. Due to the delays, a proposal in the 1970s/1980s that would have connected the parkway with the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway never came to fruition. In the spring of 1990, the Florida Legislature led by Senate leader and Winter Haven resident Bob Crawford, incorporated the Polk Parkway into the Turnpike Expansion Program, a part of Senate Bill 1316.\nThe Parkway's groundbreaking was on January 25, 1996. The western of the Parkway opened to traffic on August 9, 1998. The central section, approximately in length, opened to traffic on 2 August 1999. The easternmost of road opened to traffic on 12 December 1999, completing the highway at a cost of $490 million.\n\nIn the late summer of 2009, the Turnpike began widening the Polk Parkway from Interstate 4 at Polk City south to Pace Road from two lanes to four lanes. This $48 million design-build project includes construction of a SunPass-only interchange at Pace Road (exit 23), featuring a modified cloverleaf design, with a 25 cent toll for the to-and-from the east (north) movement. The to-and-from the west (south) movement is not tolled as there is a mainline plaza to the west where the toll will be collected. The interchange opened on November 10, 2011, providing access to the new Florida Polytechnic University campus. The project is a public-private partnership between the Florida Department of Transportation—Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise, USF Polytechnic, the Polk County Board of County Commissioners and The Williams Company.\n\nThe 1998 Florida Legislature designated the western of the Polk Parkway (between Interstate 4 and South Florida Avenue (State Road 37)) as the James Henry Mills Medal of Honor Parkway. Mills was the only native of Polk County to receive a medal of honor in World War II, in recognition of his heroic actions in Cisterna, Italy.\n\nThe Polk Parkway has become an important part of Polk County's transportation infrastructure as traffic has increased in the growing county.\n\nThere have been several plans presented to the public since the early 2000s regarding a proposed Heartland Parkway which would be a roughly parkway extending from the Polk Parkway to Southwest Florida near Ft. Myers.\n\nThere has also been a proposal to construct an extension from the Polk Parkway encircling Winter Haven and connecting with I-4 near the Polk-Osceola county line. Another proposed parkway would connect the southeast corner of the Polk Parkway with State Road 60 east of Lake Wales. These will be realized as the Central Polk Parkway (SR 570B), which is currently in the design phase.\n\n"}

He also captained Otago in the National Provincial Championship (NPC) at the age of 19. His All Black debut was versus Italy 'A' at the age of 20, and his test debut versus Fiji, age 22. In his time as an All Black he scored 12 tries for a total of 60 points.\n\nRandell excelled as a rugby player, cricketer, and student at Lindisfarne College near Hastings and in 1992 he went to the University of Otago where he completed degrees in law and commerce. He played for Otago in the National Provincial Championship and the Otago Highlanders in 1996 in the opening season of the Super 14\n\nRandell played his first game for the All Blacks in 1995 against an Italy A selection.\n\nRandell was 21 when he first captained the All Blacks in South Africa in 1996 in four non-test games and only 23 when he first captained the All Blacks vs England in 1998. Randell was selected as captain to replace Sean Fitzpatrick by new coach John Hart. At the time there was some controversy about this selection as Randell was quite young and inexperienced and it is not clear that he himself wanted to be captain.\n\nIn 1999, Randell captaining the Otago Highlanders to an 8–3 regular season record and subsequently to the 1999 Super 12 Final where they lost to the Canterbury Crusaders in a closely fought match 24–19.

{"id": "1994095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994095", "title": "Colorado State Highway 82", "text": "Colorado State Highway 82\n\nState Highway 82 (SH 82) is an state highway in the U.S. state of Colorado. Its western half provides the principal transportation artery of the Roaring Fork Valley on the Colorado Western Slope, beginning at Interstate 70 (I-70) and U.S. Highway 6 (US 6) in Glenwood Springs southeast past Carbondale, Basalt and Aspen. From there it continues up the valley to cross the Continental Divide at Independence Pass. On the Eastern Slope, it follows Lake Creek past some of Colorado's highest mountains to Twin Lakes Reservoir, where it ends at US 24 south of Leadville.\n\nAt above sea level, the traverse of Independence Pass is the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in North America, and the highest paved through road on Colorado's state highway network. The pass is closed during the winter months, isolating Aspen from the east and making Highway 82 the only way to reach the popular ski resort town by road. A private foundation has worked with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), which maintains the road, to undo environmental damage to the alpine tundra created when a disused stagecoach route built across the pass during the Colorado Silver Boom of the 1880s became Highway 82 in the early 20th century.\n\nWest of Aspen the highway follows the route of an early Colorado Midland Railroad route from the city to Glenwood Springs. Paved during the 1930s, this road has been gradually expanded to four lanes over the course of the 20th and early 21st centuries. The increased traffic resulting from Aspen's economic rebirth as a resort town has required high-occupancy vehicle lanes, bypasses and the replacement of at least one old bridge. More improvements are planned for both Aspen and Glenwood Springs.\n\nFrom its western terminus to Aspen, Highway 82 is a four-lane road, frequently divided. As it leaves Aspen, it narrows to two lanes and remains that way to its eastern terminus. Two sets of gates on either side of Independence Pass allow the road to be closed in winter.\n\nHighway 82 begins at Exit 116 from I-70 in Glenwood Springs, just 300 ft (100 m) east of the Roaring Fork's confluence with the Colorado River. It follows Laurel Street north for one block, then turns east on Sixth Street for another block, after which it turns south on Grand Avenue. From there it crosses both I-70 and the Colorado River on a viaduct past the train station into downtown Glenwood Springs.\n\nIt continues south through blocks of small-scale dense urban development to 14th Street. Glenwood Springs High School is on the west just past the intersection heralds the end of downtown. For two blocks the land around the road becomes a commercial strip with large parking lots. At Hyland Park on the east just afterwards, the land across the road is devoted to larger houses on larger lots. Strip development resumes on the west side south of 19th Street, two blocks west of Valley View Hospital. At 23rd Street, Highway 82 turns southeast to follow South Glen Avenue, paralleling the adjacent Rio Grande rail trail. Development along the highway becomes predominantly commercial, and south of 27th Street a continuous strip begins on the east side as the valley narrows. After passing Rosebud Cemetery on the west side, Highway 82 turns more to the southeast and draws alongside the Roaring Fork as it reaches the city limits.\n\nFollowing the river's bend, the road returns to its southern heading as most development focuses around Glenwood Springs Municipal Airport on the opposite bank. At its next easterly turn, the landscape around the road becomes more rural, with farms and golf courses appearing. The terrain remains generally level, at about above sea level.\n\nA mile south of the airport, at a signalized intersection with Old State Route 82, the road divides. Highway 82 turns eastward again, returning to its southerly heading after another mile when Spring Valley Road turns off to the Glenwood Springs campus of Colorado Mountain College in the mountains to the north. A half-mile (1 km) beyond that junction, at the headquarters of the Garfield County Road and Bridge District, the highway begins a long stretch with a southerly heading.\n\nAfter two miles, the road bends to the southeast amidst a valley with occasional subdivisions. Two more miles down the highway, at a rest area, Highway 82 turns east as it enters the city of Carbondale across the river. A mile from the rest area, a traffic signal controls the intersection with State Highway 133, the only other state highway to intersect 82 for its entire length. From Carbondale, Highway 133 leads south to Redstone and McClure Pass along the valley of a tributary of the Roaring Fork, the Crystal River. To the south the Mount Sopris dominates the view.\n\nA mile east of Highway 133, the valley floor widens, filled with farms and subdivisions as the road gently trends to the south. Five miles (8 km) east of Carbondale, Highway 82 crosses into Eagle County. Subdivisions begin to increase in the surrounding valley and the road soon turns to the south again as it passes a built-up area and then crosses the Roaring Fork. A mile and a half after that Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork, and then enters Pitkin County at the small unincorporated community of Emma.\n\nBasalt is one mile due east. The intersection with Basalt Avenue, the main route into that town from Highway 82, has a signal. Between Glenwood Springs and Basalt, Highway 82 climbs in elevation. As it alternately tracks southeast and south over the next towards Aspen, it begins to climb more noticeably and the valley narrows. Development becomes less dense, with many small ranches located aside the road and along the river. Three miles (5 km) south of Basalt, after another crossing of the Roaring Fork, the right lanes in both directions are marked with diamonds indicating they are high-occupancy vehicle lanes during peak hours. The median is soon replaced with a guardrail, then a brief retaining wall where the eastbound roadway is slightly elevated.\n\nThe ascent continues near Woody Creek. As Aspen–Pitkin County Airport appears on the west of the road, three miles (5 km) south of Woody Creek, the roadways merge as development around the highway increases.\n\nBeyond the airport, Highway 82 turns due south. It bends to the southeast to cross the new Maroon Creek Bridge, with the original, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, immediately to its south. At this point, with a golf course on the north side, the Aspen city limit begins to follow the road, and by the time it goes through a roundabout and passes the Holden/Marolt Mining and Ranching Museum to the south it is fully in the city of Aspen. Another stream crossing, Castle Creek, brings the highway into the developed portion of the city.\n\nFrom Basalt, Highway 82 has climbed . It levels out at Aspen, entering the city's residential West End along West Hallam Street. A block east of Castle Creek, it turns south on North Seventh Street; the intersection's southwest corner has been rounded to smooth the traffic flow, leaving a triangular traffic island in the middle of the road. Two blocks further south, at another intersection with a rounded corner, SH 82 turns east to follow West Main Street across Aspen.\n\nFive blocks east, at Garmisch Street, it becomes East Main Street. The buildings gradually change from residential to commercial, and at Mill Street Highway 82 passes one of Aspen's major landmarks, the Hotel Jerome, also listed on the National Register. Two blocks further is another listed landmark, the Pitkin County Courthouse, between Galena and Hunter streets.\n\nAfter the Spring Street intersection another two blocks past the courthouse, Main Street curves to the south, narrowing in the process. It is now a two-lane road. Two blocks to the south, SH 82 turns east again to follow East Cooper Avenue, crossing the Roaring Fork again after another two blocks. The highway curves southward, leaving Aspen three-quarters of a mile (1.1 km) further east.\n\nThe valley narrows into a canyon as the road begins to climb again, closely hugging the north wall. Four miles (6.4 km) east of the city, just past Targert Lake Road, it passes the gates where the road is closed in wintertime. Past this point development along the road abates as most of the land alongside the road is part of White River National Forest. On the north side of the road are some of Aspen's more popular climbing cliffs; on the south side are many small parking areas for trailheads, campgrounds, and popular swimming holes along the Roaring Fork like Devil's Punchbowl.\n\nThere are several short sections where past rockslides have forced the road to narrow to one lane. Access is controlled via traffic lights. The remaining log cabins and other structures of the ghost town of Independence, also listed on the National Register, are visible in the valley below at east of Aspen.\n\nShortly afterwards, Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork for the last time, a few miles below its source at Independence Lake. The road then turns along the canyon's headwall to the south. After a switchback to the north, it climbs above tree-line and into the high-elevation alpine tundra landscape of Independence Pass, from Aspen.\n\nThe road levels out to a parking area on the south side. A U.S. Forest Service sign indicates the Continental Divide and gives the elevation as . The Divide also marks the Lake County line. A paved path leads to a scenic overlook with views to Mount Elbert () and La Plata Peak (), respectively the highest and fifth-highest peaks in Colorado and the Rocky Mountains. An old road leads south along the ridge to summits to the south.\n\nBeyond the pass, the road descends through three more long switchbacks to the floor of the Lake Creek valley. From there it heads south at first but quickly curving to the east. As it assumes that heading it passes the other set of gates, just west of the very small settlement of Everett, near where Lake Creek's North Fork joins the main stream.\n\nFrom there the road heads east for the next four miles, passing trailheads for both of the fourteeners on either side and other San Isabel National Forest facilities. Just before the creek widens and empties into Twin Lakes Reservoir, the road curves quickly to the south and then heads more to the northeast along the lake shore. A mile past that bend Highway 82 reaches the small community of Twin Lakes, also listed on the National Register as a historic district as an early tourist town.\n\nThe highway continues northeast for another mile beyond Twin Lakes and then turns east, with a continuous view of the lakes on the south. Shortly past this turn, the Colorado Trail crosses the road and then runs closely parallel to it along the south side. Forest Service roads go down that direction to access points along the lake. After another mile, Highway 82 turns southeast for its next mile. Below the lakes' outlet, it crosses Lake Creek for the last time and then ends at US 24 from Independence Pass and just below the confluence of the creek and the Arkansas River. Leadville is to the north; in the opposite direction it is to Buena Vista.\n\nBecause of the high altitude of Independence Pass, winter weather there begins well before the season itself starts. The snow falls deep through the season, and remains so throughout the spring. The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) therefore closes the gates at both ends of the stretch of Highway 82 leading over the pass during those months. Typically it is closed by November 7 or the first significant winter snowfall, if that comes earlier. The pass is usually reopened just before Memorial Day weekend at the end of May after CDOT has cleared the snowpack and repaired the road. Some years when the snowfall has been lighter, the reopening has occurred several weeks earlier.\n\nThe narrow roadway, switchbacks, steep 6% grades and steep, sometimes unguarded dropoffs on either approach to the pass have also led CDOT to post advisory speeds at the turns. Some types of vehicles are banned from the pass year-round. Oversized and overweight vehicles are prohibited, as well as any vehicle or vehicle combinations longer than . As a practical matter this includes tractor trailers, buses and recreational vehicles.\n\nSome truck drivers have used the pass despite the prohibition. They are generally either unaware of the restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices, or aware of it and willing to risk the fine for the sake of the time and distance saved. The resulting accidents have forced the closure of the pass. CDOT has put in larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction. Aspen officials have suggested the fines be increased as well.\n\nIndependence Pass is popular with bicyclists, and since 2011 it has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge around Colorado. Racers cross the pass during a stage from Gunnison to Aspen. The highway is closed for the race from its western terminus to the end of the stage.\n\nBoth halves of the road trace their origins to the early days of Aspen's settlement in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.\n\nThe future eastern half of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached Aspen. A private company improved it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race to make the first rail connection, which displaced the toll road as the primary route to Aspen within a decade. Later, the railroad's right-of-way would serve as the basis for the highway.\n\nOn July 4, 1879, the settlement of Independence was established just west of the pass, taking its name from the Independence Day holiday, and soon lending it to the pass among other natural features in the area. Independence's gold deposits were quickly opened by miners. By the following year the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company had improved the path through the pass, which followed a route close to Highway 82's present alignment, to the point that horses could make the trip.\n\nThe company's goal was to continue down the valley and connect to some existing mining camps such as Ashcroft. Miners had preferred to take a longer route there from Leadville, via Cottonwood and Taylor passes to the south. A viable route over Independence Pass would shorten that journey by .\n\nSettlement continued to follow the river down the valley. At the confluence with Castle Creek, the valley widened and offered a flood plain conducive to the development of a town. The slopes of the surrounding mountains proved to have the silver deposits the prospectors had anticipated, and very soon the mining camp became a small city, named Aspen after the trees that filled the surrounding forests. It grew rapidly, becoming the seat of the newly created Pitkin County, named after the governor its earliest settlers had disobeyed by coming there.\n\nWith more and more people coming to Aspen, a better road from the east was needed. An early investor in the city, B. Clark Wheeler, put up the money needed to improve the path over the pass to a stage road. It opened in November 1881, just as winter was beginning. The tolls, 25 cents for saddle horses and twice that for stages ($ and $ in modern dollars respectively) were primarily spent hiring a large crew of men who kept the pass clear in winter with snowshovels. They were able to keep the road through the pass open during its first five winters. In deep enough snow passengers switched to sleighs; in summer, dogs ran in advance to warn oncoming traffic through the pass itself as the stages took the switchbacks at full speed. It usually took a stage 10–25 hours and five changes of horses to reach Aspen from Twin Lakes.\n\nThe road over the pass was barely capable of handling the massive amounts of silver ore coming out of Aspen's mines. At first they had to be taken to Leadville by mule train to be smelted. Plants were built in the city soon afterwards, but it was still difficult and expensive to transport the silver obtained. The market was growing in the wake of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the U.S. government to buy the metal on a regular basis.\n\nA railroad link to Aspen was therefore likely to be highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.\n\nNew leadership at both companies started the race to Aspen. James John Hagerman joined the Midland in 1885, refreshing the company coffers with his mining fortune. A year later the railroad had laid of track from Colorado Springs to Leadville and crossed the Continental Divide via the Hagerman Tunnel, then the world's highest. It got to Glenwood Springs and began working its way up the valley to Aspen.\n\nDavid Moffat became the Rio Grande's president in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives to go ahead with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.\n\nThe opening of the rail connections was a death blow to the stage road. Gold production in Independence had declined sharply after 1884, and many of the town's early settlers had moved down the valley to Aspen. With the corresponding reduction in stage traffic and tolls, the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company could not afford to keep the road clear over the winter of 1886. Two years later, after the railroads began service, the company folded and abandoned the road. Independence itself met the same fate a decade later when its remaining population decamped to Aspen during the severe winter of 1899, leaving its buildings standing as a ghost town (one remaining resident lingered until 1920).\n\nOn the other side of Aspen, the railroads initially enjoyed great success. The Rio Grande line was upgraded to standard gauge in 1890, and for the next several years both it and the Midland were at capacity. But when the Panic of 1893 began, Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, instantly collapsing the silver market. Many Aspen mines closed, and miners left the city for new boomtowns like Cripple Creek. The ensuing decades saw a steady decline in Aspen's population, a period referred to as the \"quiet years\" of the city's history.\n\nThere was still enough mining to keep the railroads busy, but not for long. In 1897 the Midland went bankrupt. It continued operating, and a new company formed under the same name to take over. In 1919 Smuggler Mine, the city's largest and oldest, shut down most of its operations and several others closed. The second Midland again succumbed to bankruptcy; there was no second resurrection. Its tracks and right-of-way, including the bridges, were abandoned.\n\nThey soon reverted to state ownership. The Colorado Highway Commission used them to realize plans it had made a decade earlier, when it first designated the future Highway 82 through the Roaring Fork Valley. With the Midland's tracks unused, it now had a graded route that could easily be adapted for highway purposes.\n\nBefore developing the route west of Aspen, the state turned its attention the other way. In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated it part of Highway 82, closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs. Most of it followed the original route; however in some places it deviated. The largest section of the original remains three miles (5 km) below the pass on the east approach. The foundation of the gatekeeper's house remains, as well as some of the original toll gate.\n\nDuring the Depression, the state sought to ease unemployment through public works projects as an economic stimulus. It applied this to the new Highway 82. First it converted the Maroon Creek Bridge for automotive traffic by widening it with a timber deck, which was then paved and supported with outriggers. In 1937, four miles (6.4 km) between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale was paved; the remainder of the road to Aspen was oiled the following year.\n\nIt had been the hope that the improvements in the valley's road transportation would benefit the remaining mines. While the ranchers were able to get their products to market faster, the new road would catalyze Aspen's economic revival in an industry that had not existed when the Depression began: recreational downhill skiing. As Highway 82 was being improved, skiing enthusiasts from both the U.S. and Central Europe were cutting trails and building on the mountain south of town. The 1940 census recorded an increase in Aspen's population, the first in a half-century.\n\nFurther development was halted during the war years afterward, although the Tenth Mountain Division, which trained at nearby Camp Hale, came to appreciate Aspen and its skiing. Many of them came back to Aspen after the war, helping to expand and staff the ski resort. Coincidentally, Walter Paepcke, head of the Container Corporation of America, visited Aspen with his wife Elizabeth in the late 1940s, and found it an ideal place to establish a music festival they were planning. He invested heavily in the city's redevelopment, and people began coming to Aspen again to live, work and play. While the Rio Grande's trains still ran, many new visitors and arrivals preferred to drive.\n\nBy 1960 the population of Pitkin County had increased by 44%, the second-fastest growth rate on the Western Slope. The Aspen Skiing Company built two additional resorts, Buttermilk and Snowmass, to the west, contributing to traffic on the highway. In 1962 the Colorado Department of Highways, began a 12-year project to expand Highway 82 to four lanes between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale. The Maroon Creek Bridge was widened in 1963 to handle its increased traffic.\n\nOn the east, the road over Independence Pass was paved in 1967. The Rio Grande discontinued passenger train service to Aspen in 1969. It was soon replaced the next year, when the completion of Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon connected the western terminus of Highway 82 to the larger Interstate Highway System.\n\nIn the 1980s, it became apparent that four lanes at the western end was not enough. Several safety improvement areas were identified and projects implemented. In 1988 the Basalt Bypass relocated the highway off its original alignment through that town (currently Two Rivers Road), to a new two-lane road to the south of it that crossed the Roaring Fork to the east of the town.\n\nAt the end of the decade, the Independence Pass Foundation (IPF) was formally incorporated in Aspen. Its founder, environmental activist Bob Lewis, had been organizing efforts to revegetate the slopes alongside Highway 82 going up to the pass, in order to repair damage that had been done the road's construction. In cooperation with the Highway Department, the U.S. Forest Service and the county, the IPF rebuilt a curve along the road near the Weller Lake trailhead that year.\n\nSafety improvements continued in the 1990s. A five-mile (8 km) stretch just west of Aspen was resurfaced in 1991. A special skid-resistant treatment was added to the areas that receive no sun in the winter due to shade from Shale Bluffs. The next year, in 1992, three two-year projects began expanding Highway 82 to four lanes between Carbondale and Basalt, including the new bypass. An old truss bridge near Wingo Junction was replaced in 1995; it was followed over the remainder of the decade by widening most of the remaining sections between Basalt and Aspen. At the Maroon Creek Bridge outside Aspen, a pedestrian bridge was built to the north to take foot traffic off the older bridge in an effort to relieve congestion.\n\nThe high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes were designated in 1998. When they opened, they were the first anywhere in a rural area of Colorado. In a departure from the usual practice, the diamonds were painted in the right lanes rather than the left, so that Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) buses could get to and from their stops more easily.\n\nEast of Aspen, the IPF began holding its annual Ride for the Pass bicycle race fundraiser in 1994. The race has been held almost every year since on the weekend before CDOT opens the pass. It follows a course from the gate to Independence. Two years after the first one the IPF began the project Lewis had always envisioned for it—restoring the Top Cut, the section just below the pass on the east, where the environmental damage, especially erosion, had always been most evident.\n\nIn the new century CDOT began the projects that would complete the four-lane expansion. It took one year to finish the expansion from Aspen Airport Business Center to Buttermilk. Three years later, in 2004, the section in Snowmass Canyon was expanded to four lanes at a cost of $100 million.\n\nHighway 82 was now a four-lane road all the way from Glenwood Springs to Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was functionally obsolete and structurally deficient. Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway, it could not be expanded any further.\n\nA 1990 CDOT design proposal for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen and the town of Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.\n\nThe new bridge cost $14 million and was opened in the middle of 2008. The old bridge remains in place next to it as a pedestrian walkway and historic landmark. The National Segmental Bridge Institute recognized CDOT and the new bridge with a Bridge Award for Excellence in 2010.\n\nColorado State Highway 82 Business (SH 82 Bus.) was an east–west state highway in the U.S. state of Colorado. SH 82 Bus.'s western terminus was at SH 82 west Basalt, and the eastern terminus was at SH 82 in Basalt. It is now locally maintained as Two Rivers Road. SH 82 Bus. was created in 1988 when the SH 82 bypass was completed around the south side of Basalt, and SH 82 Bus. was ran along the former routing through Basalt. SH 82 Bus. was turned back to local control between 2005 and 2007.\n\nWith the widening of the highway to four lanes between Glenwood Springs and Aspen complete, CDOT has turned its attention to the ends of that corridor.\n\nBy the 21st century, Highway 82 had grown to four lanes. It was easier for traffic to get to Aspen but did not resolve the congestion that developed when it got there. Since the 1970s various plans to alleviate the congestion had been put forth, some involving ballot initiatives decided by the voters of the city and/or county. In 1998 CDOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), after considering all the proposals and taking public input, released a Record of Decision. The preferred alternative combined highway and intersection improvements, mass transit and incremental transportation management.\n\nSome of the recommended improvements, such as the roundabout, replacement Maroon Creek Bridge, and improvements to the intersections along Highway 82 between the city and the airport, have been implemented. Right-of-way easements have been acquired for a new two-lane parkway, as authorized by voters, that would cross the Holden/Marolt property via a cut and cover tunnel to reconnect to the existing highway at Main and Seventh streets. City voters also authorized light rail for that route.\n\nIf built, the light rail would have as its western terminus a maintenance facility across Highway 82 from the airport. It would include a stop at Buttermilk and parallel the highway, using the old Maroon Creek Bridge, until it reached Monarch Street downtown. There it would turn south to its eastern terminus at Rubey Park. If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail, it could be built as bus lanes at first.\n\nProposed transportation management strategies are aimed at keeping traffic into Aspen at the baseline 1993 level through 2015. There are three levels or strategic response: The first would be when that baseline is equaled or slightly exceeded. It would consist of promoting ride sharing and more extensive transit use, among other informational measures. At Level 2, when traffic reaches a few percentage points above that level, more transit service would be added, and parking rates raised slightly to fund the additional buses required to reduce headways. Level 3 would be implemented when traffic levels had exceeded the baseline by 5–10%, and would use more forceful measures such as steeper increases in parking fees, deliberately limiting the number of spaces available, and making some parts of downtown Aspen car-free zones.\n\nThe current bridge along Grand Avenue over the Colorado River and I-70 just east of the highway's western terminus dates to 1953. It was built as a two-lane bridge with shoulders; expansion since then has added a second lane in either direction. By the early 21st century it, like the Maroon Creek Bridge, was carrying more traffic than it had ever been expected to and was in poor structural condition.\n\nIn the early 2000s CDOT began considering plans for a replacement bridge. The major issue was whether a new bridge should be built along the same alignment as the existing bridge, or instead curve westward to make a more direct connection with the interstate's Exit 116. After a public hearing in August 2012, the agency announced that the latter seemed to be overwhelmingly preferred. It remained to decide whether to have a signalized intersection or a roundabout at the intersection of Sixth Street and Laurel Avenue.\n\nSome residents of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, as it did in Basalt. They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.\n\nThe Grand Avenue Bridge functionally opened to the public November 6, 2017. It is the largest construction project completed on the Western Slope of Colorado in the past 25 years.\n\n"}

The Centre was operational between 1839 and 2011 with a number of breaks in between, and was re-opened in September 2016. Initially established as Berrima Gaol, the facility closed in 1909 and reopened in 1949 as the Berrima Training Centre. The Centre is the oldest Australian correctional facility in operation. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nThe old Berrima Gaol was built in 1835-9 of local sandstone at a cost of £5,400. Convicted London joiner and carpenter James Gough (1790-1876) who arrived on the Earl Spencer in 1813 and gained his conditional pardon in 1821, was awarded the construction of Berrima Gaol in partnership with John Richards in 1834; much of the construction work was done by convicts in irons. It initially comprised 34 cells accommodating 66 prisoners. The design was adopted by the Governor, Richard Bourke, from the SIPD (Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline) pamphlet. Conditions at the gaol were harsh, prisoners spent most of their days in cells and the only light was through a small grate set in the door. It was originally designed to hold prisoners from the surrounding areas, but Goulburn Gaol took over this role and it became a subsidiary prison housing sick and aged convicts from other gaols.\n\nAustralia's first serial killer John Lynch was hanged here in 1842. Another of the notable trials held in the nearby Berrima Court House was that of Lucretia Dunkley and her lover Martin Beech. Both were hanged in 1843 for the murder of Dunkley's husband. Dunkley was the only woman hanged at Berrima Gaol.\n\nIn 1866 the Gaol was renovated to the standards described by the prison reform movement for a \"model prison\", enlarging the prison such as to provide separate cells for 110 prisoners. However, Berrima Gaol had solitary confinement cells which measured 8 feet by 5 feet, some smaller, where it was intended that all prisoners spent one year. In 1877 a Royal Commission was held to investigate allegations of cruelty by the prison authorities, but the complaints were not upheld.\n\nIn 1898, a residence for the governor (or superintendent) of the jail was built next door to the gaol. In the 1930s it was used as a police station. A house for the deputy superintendent was built on the other side of the gaol.\n\nThe gaol was closed in 1909. During World War I the army used Berrima Gaol (in conjunction with an adjacent area, now known as the Berrima Internment Camp Huts Area) as a German-prisoner internment camp. Most of the 329 internees were enemy aliens from shipping companies. There were German officers from Rabaul, German New Guinea (what is now Papua New Guinea) and also officers from the light cruiser SMS \"Emden\".\n\nBetween the wars the gaol was opened for public inspection as a place of historic interest. From 1944 to 1949, the whole gaol was rebuilt by prison labour at a cost of 18,000 pounds. Only the entrance and outer walls of old Berrima Gaol were left standing. In 1948 the Berrima Training Centre, a minimum security correctional centre opened at the Berrima Gaol.\n\nBetween 1970 and 2001, the Centre was classified as minimum/medium security for male inmates. Most inmates were permitted to work outside of the Centre on the local market gardens managed by Corrective Services NSW. Some detainees were permitted to maintain local parks and gardens and also assist with duties in the community such as fighting fires with the local firefighters.\n\nIn 2001 the Centre changed its name to Berrima Correctional Centre and, after one hundred and sixty six years as a men's prison, the Centre became a woman's prison, with a capacity of fifty-nine inmates.\n\nImmediately prior to its closure in 2011, the Centre was an all-female low-to-medium-security prison, and was responsible for the administration of a periodic detention centre and court cells at Wollongong. In the 2011 NSW State Budget, the Government announced that the centre would be closed, which took effect on 4 November 2011.\n\nThe Centre was re-opened on 27 September 2016 as part of a statewide initiative to add 1400 beds to the New South Wales prison population. It is expected to house 75 minimum security prisoners.\n\nBerrima Gaol is one of the few remaining compounds dating from pre 1840. It is an early example of the application of model prison layouts. Associated with the development of Berrima, and the adjacent courthouse, the Gaol is significant for its phases of use.\n\nBerrima Correctional Centre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\n\n\n"}

A woman's reformatory with a well-patronised laundry was constructed in 1883-84 by Richard Godsall outside the prison walls and opened in 1869. On 14 Sep 1898 the prison was proclaimed a prison for females only.\n\nThe gaol was closed in 1903 after the prisoners were transferred to Boggo Road Gaol and demolition commenced.

It was founded by J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd. and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1962, with the English-born dancer, teacher, repetiteur and director Dame Peggy van Praagh as founding artistic director. Today, it is recognised as one of the world's major international ballet companies.\n\nThe roots of the Australian Ballet can be found in the Borovansky Ballet, a company founded in 1940 by the Czech dancer Edouard Borovansky. Borovansky had been a dancer in the touring ballet company of the famous Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova and, after visiting Australia on tour with the Covent Garden Russian Ballet, he decided to remain in Australia, establishing a ballet school in Melbourne in 1939, out of which he developed a performance group which became the Borovansky Ballet. The company was supported and funded by J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd from 1944. Following Borovansky's death in 1959, the British dancer and administrator Dame Peggy van Praagh DBE was invited to become artistic director of the company. J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd decided to disband the Borovansky Ballet in 1961.\n\nIn 1961, J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust received federal subsidy towards the establishment of a national ballet company. These organisations established the Australian Ballet Foundation to assist with the establishment of a new company, which in 1962 became the Australian Ballet. Peggy van Praagh, who had been kept on a retainer by J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd through the intervening year between the disbanding of the Borovansky Ballet and the establishment of the Australian Ballet, was invited to become the founding artistic director of the company. The majority of the dancers employed by the fledgling company were drawn from former members of the Borovansky Ballet.\n\nThe first performance by the Australian Ballet was Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", staged at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney on 2 November 1962. The principal dancers in the first season were Kathleen Gorham OBE, Marilyn Jones AM OBE and Garth Welch AM. Van Praagh also invited the Royal Ballet's Ray Powell to temporarily became the company's first ballet master, with Leon Kellaway (brother of Cecil Kellaway), a former dancer with the Covent Garden Russian Ballet, as the company's first ballet teacher. In later years Sir Robert Helpmann CBE, Marilyn Jones AM OBE and Maina Gielgud AO made major contributions as Artistic Directors of the Australian Ballet.\n\nIn 1964 van Praagh established the Australian Ballet School, which was formed specially to train dancers for the company and remains the company's associate school to this day. Dame Margaret Scott AC DBE was the founding director of the school, followed by Gailene Stock CBE AM, Marilyn Rowe AM OBE, and now Lisa Pavane, all three former company principal artists.\n\nToday the company is based in Melbourne; its Southbank headquarters is the Primrose Potter Australian Ballet Centre, named after its long term supporter Lady (Primrose) Potter. The company tours to mainland state capital cities within Australia, with annual seasons in Melbourne at the State Theatre (accompanied by Orchestra Victoria) and in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House accompanied by the Opera Australia Orchestra. Other venues are the Lyric Theatre at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Brisbane, and the Adelaide Festival Centre in Adelaide. The company also tours internationally, and performs annually in an intimate outdoor setting on Hamilton Island.\n\nThe Australian Ballet works in close cooperation with the Australian Ballet School, of which many of the company's dancers are graduates. Giving approximately 200 performances a year, the Australian Ballet claims to be the busiest ballet company in the world. With a vast repertoire which includes the major classical and heritage works as well as contemporary productions, it follows its artistic vision of \"Caring for Tradition, Daring to be Different\". Each year, the company also presents an extensive national education and outreach programme including STEAMDANCE- a STEM-based dance curriculum, created and run by Head of Education Katy McKeown, a teacher education program and digital resources, to further inspire and educate its audiences. It's Dance Education team performs and teaches over 40,000 children per year with culturally relevant content.\n\nBox office sales, derived from its strong and loyal audience base, are the foundation of the company's income stream. The Australian Ballet also receives funding from the Australian, Victorian and New South Wales governments, corporate sponsors, private donors and bequests.\n\nThe company's current artistic director is David McAllister AM, who was a principal dancer until 2001. The company's previous artistic directors were: Ross Stretton (1996–2001); Maina Gielgud AO (1983–96); Marilyn Jones AM OBE (1979–82); Anne Woolliams (1976–77); Sir Sir Robert Helpmann CBE (1965–76) and the founding artistic director, Dame Peggy van Praagh DBE (1962–74; 1978)\nThe most recent appointment to the position of executive director (July 2013) is Libby Christie, former Managing Director of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Her predecessor was Valerie Wilder, who succeeded Richard Evans. In March 2020, David Hallberg, a resident guest, was announced as the new artistic director of the company. He will take up this position in January 2021.\n\nThe Music Director and chief conductor of The Australian Ballet since 2003 has been Nicolette Fraillon, the world's only woman chief conductor of a ballet company.\n\nDancers with The Australian Ballet are:\n\n\nThe Telstra Ballet Dancer Awards have been made annually since 2003, in support of the aspirations of The Australian Ballet's elite young dancers.

It is situated at a distance of 127 km from Shivpuri, 37 km from Lalitpur, 55 km from Ashok Nagar and about 46 km from Isagarh. It is surrounded by hills southwest of the Betwa River. Chanderi is surrounded by hills, lakes and forests and is spotted with several monuments of the Bundela Rajputs and Malwa sultans. It is famous for ancient Jain Temples.\nIts population in 2011 was 33,081.\n\nChanderi is a block in Ashok Nagar District. Chanderi is located strategically on the borders of Malwa and Bundelkhand. History of Chanderi goes back to the 11th century, when it was dominated by the trade routes of Central India and was proximate to the arterial route to the ancient ports of Gujarat as well as to Malwa, Mewar, Central India and the Deccan. Consequently, Chanderi became an important military outpost. The town also finds mention in Mahabharata. Shishupal was the king of Chanderi during the Mahabharata period.\n\nChanderi is mentioned by the Persian scholar Alberuni in 1030.\nGhiyas ud din Balban captured the city in 1251 for Nasiruddin Mahmud, Sultan of Delhi. Sultan Mahmud I Khilji of Malwa captured the city in 1438 after a siege of several months. In 1520 Rana Sanga of Mewar captured the city, and gave it to Medini Rai, a rebellious minister of Sultan Mahmud II of Malwa. In the Battle of Chanderi, the Mughal Emperor Babur captured the city from Medini Rai and witnessed the macabre Rajput rite of jauhar, in which, faced with certain defeat and in an attempt to escape dishonor in the hands of the enemy, women with children in their arms jumped in a fire pit to commit suicide, which was made for this specific purpose, against the background of vedic hymns recited by the priests. Jauhar was performed during the night and in the morning the men would rub the ashes of their dead women folk on their forehead, don a saffron garment known as kesariya, chew tulsi leaves (in India tulsi leaves are placed in the mouth of a dead body), symbolizing their awareness about impending death and resolve to fight and die with honour. This method of fighting & dying for the cause of retaining honour was called \"SAKA\".\n\nIn 1540 it was captured by Sher Shah Suri, and added to the governorship of Shujaat Khan.\nThe Mughal Emperor Akbar made the city a \"sarkar\" in the \"subah\" of Malwa. According to Ain-e-Akbari, the autobiography of Akbar, Chanderi had 14000 stone houses and boasted of 384 markets, 360 sapcious caravan sarais (resting place) and 12,000 mosques.\n\nThe Bundela Rajputs captured the city in 1586, and it was held by Ram Sab, a son of Raja Madhukar of Orchha. In 1680 Devi Singh Bundela was made governor of the city, and Chanderi remained in the hands of his family until it was annexed in 1811 by Jean Baptiste Filose for the Maratha ruler Daulat Rao Sindhia of Gwalior.\nThe city was transferred to the British in 1844.\nThe British lost control of the city during the Revolt of 1857, and the city was recaptured by Hugh Rose on 14 March 1858. Richard Harte Keatinge led the assault, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. The city was transferred back to the Sindhias of Gwalior in 1861, and became part of Isagarh District of Gwalior state.\n\nAfter India's independence in 1947, Gwalior became part of the new state of Madhya Bharat, which was merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956.\n\nChanderi is located at . It has an average elevation of 456 metres (1496 feet).\n\n India census, Chanderi had a population of 28,313. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%.\n\n\nThere is a good roadway network in Chanderi. The town lies at State Highway 20 with connections to Ashoknagar, ISHAGARH, Lalitpur etc.\nThere is no Railway line in Chanderi neither nearby. A proposed Railway line was enacted in 2014 as Pipraigaon-Chanderi-Lalitpur line of Northern Railways, Which will be in progress soon.\n\nOne can easily visit Chanderi via\n\nThe Chanderi area has been a major center of Jain culture. It was a major center of the Parwar Jain community. There are a number of Jain places nearby- Gurilagiri (7 km), Aamanachar (29 km), Bithala (19 km), Bhamon (16 km), Khandargiri (2 km), Thuvanji (22 km) and Bhiyadant (14 km), and Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh (20 km, across the border).\n\nAt a distance of 19 km from present Chanderi town is situated the Buddhi (old) Chanderi. Buddhi Chanderi is situated on the banks of Urvashi river. It is believed that the Chaidnagar mentioned in Puranas is same as Buddhi Chanderi. There is a myth that when Raja Nala left Damayanti asleep in the forests of Narwar she moved through dense forests and reached Chaidnagar protecting herself from wild animals. The route through forests from Narwar to Chanderi is very short. A number of 9th and 10th century Jain temples are there in Buddhi Chanderi attracting thousands of Jain pilgrims from all over the country.\n\nThe Jain Bhattarakas of Mula Sangh, Balatkara Gana had a center at Chanderi that flourished for several centuries.

Phulachandra Shastri is as following:\n\n\nA branch of this lineage continued at Sironj.\n\n\nList of Jain temples at Chanderi:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the episode of 1st, 2nd and 3rd January 2020 respectively, they telecast Chanderi's places which filmed in Chanderi's palace, Jageshwari mandir, Laxman mandir, panbeshwar talab and Kuku Taal(Kuku talaiya).\n\n\n\n"}

It is placed under a table covered with a cloth that extends to the floor to provide heat for people sitting at the table. This arrangement is similar to the Japanese \"kotatsu\" or Iranian \"korsi\". Modern \"braseros\" are electric, but in the past they have been coal fired.\n\nThe \"brasero\" was considered a dangerous piece of furniture inside a house, because the embers it generated were not retained. Many accidental fires have been ignited by fabric coming in contact with \"braseros\". Because a \"brasero\" is covered, combustion occurred with small quantities of oxygen, and instead of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide was generated. Carbon monoxide poisoning often killed silently while the victims slept, especially when habitations were poorly ventilated.\n\nThe modern \"brasero\" is an electric heater with a thermostat attached to guard against too much heat being generated. Most homes in Spain had a \"brasero\" until modern heating systems were installed in newly built homes over the last 15 years. The \"brasero\" is making a comeback due to rising heating prices and the economic crisis. \n\nIn South America, notably Argentina, a \"brasero\" is a small grill attached to a box with coals used to serve sizzling hot meats at an asado.\n"}

His grandfather was Sir Charles des Voeux, 1st Baronet. His great-grandfather was a Huguenot from Normandy, France, who settled in Ireland in the early 18th century.\n\nDes Vœux attended a public school in London before starting his studies at Charterhouse School (1845–1853) and Balliol College, Oxford (1854–1856), but left without a degree after his father gave him the choice of finishing his degree and become a clergyman or seeking his fortune in the colonies. \nDes Vœux then moved to Canada, where he finished his BA at the University of Toronto and became a barrister in Upper Canada in 1861.\n\nDes Vœux became stipendiary magistrate and superintendent of rivers and creeks in British Guiana from 1863 to 1869, where he championed native causes. He reorganised and codified old French system of law when he was the Administrator and Colonial Secretary of St. Lucia between 1869 and 1880. Afterwards, Des Vœux was appointed Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific from 1880 to 1885. He was appointed Governor of Newfoundland from 1886 to 1887.\n\nBased on his experience in Guiana where he witnessed many instances of cruel and unjust treatment of indentured servants by plantation owners and managers, des Vœux wrote a 10,000-word report in 1869 to Lord Granville, the Secretary of State for the Colonies in which he detailed many abuses. When the contents of the report were published, there was a great outcry and the Commission of Inquiry into the Treatment of Immigrants was conducted. Des Vœux gave testimony before the commission in Georgetown and its report led to many improvements in the workers' treatment.\n\nDes Vœux served as the tenth Governor of Hong Kong from 1887 to 1891. This was the last post he held in the Colonial Services. During his tenure, in 1888, the Peak Tram began operation, providing relatively affordable transportation for people living on The Peak, an area he segregated, together with effectively all the elevated areas of Hong Kong Island, from crowded Chinese-style tenements by the enactment, in November of that year, of the European District Reservation Ordinance. A year before he left office, the newly established Hong Kong Electric Company began providing electricity to Hong Kong Island.\n\nAfter Des Vœux's time as Governor of Hong Kong ended, he entered retirement. He was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1893. In 1903, he published his memoirs called \"My colonial service in British Guiana, St. Lucia, Trinidad, Fiji, Australia, Newfoundland and Hong Kong, with interludes\".\n\nOn 24 July 1875, Des Vœux married Marion Denison Pender (1856–1955), daughter of submarine telegraphy pioneer John Pender. They had two daughters and five sons, three of whom died in infancy. Des Vœux died in Brighton, England, on 15 December 1909.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Meigs syndrome resolves after the resection of the tumor. Because the transdiaphragmatic lymphatic channels are larger in diameter on the right, the pleural effusion is classically on the right side. The causes of the ascites and pleural effusion are poorly understood. Atypical Meigs syndrome, characterized by a benign pelvic mass with right-sided pleural effusion but without ascites, can also occur. As in typical Meigs syndrome, pleural effusion resolves after removal of the pelvic mass.\n\nMeigs syndrome may mimic other conditions, since it is tumor arising from ovaries, pathology of any organs present in the abdomen may show a similar set of symptoms. These include various gynecological disorders of the uterus such as endometrial tumor, sarcoma, leiomyoma (pseudo-Meigs syndrome); fallopian tube disorders such as hydrosalpinx, granulomatous salpingitis, fallopian tube malignancy; ovarian disorders such as serous, mucinous, endometrioid, or clear cell carcinoma, Brenner tumor, granulosa cell tumor, stromal tumor, dysgerminoma, fibroma, or metastatic tumor to the ovary.\n\nMeigs syndrome is characterized by the presence of a benign solid ovarian tumor associated with ascites and right hydrothorax that disappear after tumor removal. Non-gynecological manifestations include: \nascites, portal vein obstruction, inferior vena cava obstruction, hypoproteinaemia, thoracic duct obstruction, tuberculosis, amyloidosis, pancreatitis, ovarian hyperstimulation, exudate pleural effusion, congestive heart failure, metastatic tumors to the peritoneal surfaces, collagen-vascular disease, and cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nThese entities must be clinically excluded.\nClinical condition characterized by ovarian mass, ascites, and right-sided pleural effusion.Ovarian malignancy and the \nother causes (see “Differential Diagnosis”) of pelvic mass, ascites, and pleural effusion to be considered, History of early satiety, \nweight loss with increased abdominal girth, bloating, intermittent abdominal pain, dyspnea, nonproductive cough may help in differentiating potential local factor causing such symptoms.\n\nTreatment of Meigs syndrome consists of thoracentesis and paracentesis to drain off the excess fluid (exudate), and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or wedge resection to correct the underlying cause.\n\nMeigs syndrome is named for Joe Vincent Meigs.\n"}

Its plot follows a nerdy college student who blackmails a group of young men with his knowledge that they have cheated throughout college, and uses it to get closer to a young woman he is obsessed with.\n\nDave Goodman, Sam Schecter, and Jeff Davis are best friends who have spent almost four years at Holden University scamming their way through college. During one exam scam in their final semester Dave discovers Angela, and asks her out while writing his phone number on her exam sheet. Ethan Dulles (who calls himself \"Cool Ethan\"), a classmate obsessed with Angela to the extent of collecting loose hairs and making a hair doll and having surveillance photos and a shrine to Angela setup in his dorm room, takes her exam question sheet after Angela leaves and uses it to repeatedly confront and then blackmail the guys into setting up a successful date with Angela for him in exchange for his silence on the matter. The guys set Ethan up in multiple situations in an attempt to convince Angela to like him, while Dave tells Sam during their work researching her that Angela is no more important to him as any other scam they have done. Ethan fails to attract her after frequent confrontations based on his delusional behavior, immaturity and ignorance of social norms. Though Ethan seems a lonely harmless nerd, he is scheming, psychotically obsessive and hopelessly socially incompetent.\n\nWhile trying to convince Angela to go out with Ethan, Dave and Angela grow a mutual attraction to each other. After telling Ethan that he has failed to convince Angela to go out with him, Ethan reveals to Dave that he has been obsessing over Angela for quite some time. He reminds Dave that he still intends to get Dave and his friends expelled if they fail him. Angela and Dave go on an impromptu date after a study session. Ethan finds out and follows and records them. Dave and Angela share a romantic swim and lovemaking session, which causes Ethan to storm around the campus in an obscene and childish tantrum (thus showing that while Ethan is lonely, he is in no way ready for a relationship). In revenge, he shows the tape of Dave and Angela making love to Sam and Jeff to establish that Dave intends to keep Angela for himself. Sam and Jeff, unhappy with Dave's dishonesty, hand over their research on Angela. Ethan uses that file to prove to Angela that Dave and his friends were actively stalking her. This causes Dave to punch Ethan in the face. But as far as Ethan is concerned he has won and Angela is his.\n\nAfter a falling out with everyone, Dave returns to the dorm and admits to Sam and Jeff that he honestly cares for Angela. After making amends, the guys sabotage Ethan's job interview with a law firm and, during the final exam, while Dave is telling the truth to Angela in front of the whole class about his entire dishonest college career of cheating, Jeff plants an answer key in Ethan's backpack while tipping off the teaching assistant proctoring the exam. In the end the guys get expelled, but Dave and Angela get back together and Sam ends up in a relationship with Angela's roommate, Reanna Cass while Jeff falsifies their diplomas from Holden University after Angela and Reanna graduate. Ethan, now miserable that he lost Angela forever and having also been expelled from college after it was revealed he was stalking her, continues to work at the restaurant. The movie ends with him singing his love of Angela and his hatred for Dave.\n\nThe film has a few tracks from Handsome Boy Modeling School (Prince Paul & Dan The Automator), including \"Holy Calamity\" and \"Rock & Roll (Could Never Hip-Hop Like This)\". It has a symphonic instrumental performance of \"Baba O'Riley\" from The Who playing over the opening credits, as well as an A Capella performance of \"The Sign\" by Ace of Base (sung by a college choir) during a scene.\n\nAs of June 2015, based on 105 reviews collected by the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Slackers\" has received an overall rating average of 10%, with an average score of 3.1 out of 10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Another teen comedy with little on its mind but moving to the next gross-out gag, \"Slackers\" strains for laughs and features grating characters.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 12/100 based on 28 critics, meaning “overwhelming dislike”. A few critics noted the dialogue as a positive, but not sufficiently good to warrant attention.\n\n\"Slackers\" opened at #11 in the box office with $2,785,283, the 11th highest-grossing opening film of the weekend, and lasted only two weeks in theaters before it closed on February 14, 2002, with a domestic total of $5,285,941 and $1,127,974 internationally, for a worldwide total of $6,413,915.\n\n\"Slackers\" was marketed as a raunchy comedy primarily, rather than as a romantic comedy, which was fair to the content; Philip French commented that \"\"Slackers\" makes \"American Pie\" look like \"The Importance of Being Earnest\".\"\n\nRoger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a zero out of four stars and described the film as \"a dirty movie. Not a sexy, erotic steamy or even smutty movie.\" \n\n"}

It was formerly named red-breasted blackbird but is not closely related to the red-winged blackbird group.\n\nThe red-breasted meadowlark is resident from south-western Costa Rica, which it has recently colonised, and Trinidad, south to north-eastern Peru and central Brazil. In 2008, it was sighted for the first time in Nicaragua.\n\nLike other meadowlarks, it is a bird associated with open country, including moist grasslands, pasture and cultivation, preferably with the odd bush or fence post for males to use as a songpost. In display the male flies up to in the air, then parachutes down on folded wings whilst singing a wheezing song, \"ti-ti-pee-pee-KWAAAAAA\". The call is a short \"tsip\".\n\nThe red-breasted meadowlark builds a deep grass-lined open cup nest on the ground amongst tall grasses, with several nests often close together. The normal clutch is two to four reddish brown-blotched cream eggs.\n\nThe red-breasted meadowlark is a small icterid, long and weighing . Males are larger than females. The male has mainly black plumage, apart from a bright red throat, belly and wing epaulets. This striking \"redcoat\" plumage gives rise to the specific name \"militaris\" and the Trinidadian name \"soldier bird\".\n\nThe female has buff edged dark brown upperpart feathers, buff underparts with a reddish tinge, and pale streaks through the crown and eye. Juveniles resemble the female, but are paler and lack the reddish tint to the underparts.\n\nThis species is very closely related to the white-browed meadowlark, \"S. superciliaris\" which breeds further south, and was formerly considered to be subspecies of red-breasted meadowlark. The male white-browed is easily distinguished by his bright white supercilium, but females of the two species are almost identical. Female red-breasted meadowlarks are longer billed, smaller, and shorter winged than their relative, with more red and less streaking on the underparts.\n\nThis gregarious bird feeds mainly on insects and some seeds, including rice, and forages on the ground like a bobolink.\n\nThe red-breasted meadowlark has benefited from the more open habitat created by forest clearance and ranching, and is extending its range. It is uncertain whether sightings on Tobago represent a small breeding population or wanderers from Trinidad or South America.\n\n"}
{"id": "1994211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994211", "title": "Operation Musketoon", "text": "Operation Musketoon\n\nOperation Musketoon was the codeword of a British–Norwegian commando raid in the Second World War. The operation was mounted against the German-held Glomfjord power plant in Norway from 11 to 21 September 1942.\n\nThe raiders consisted of two officers and eight men from No. 2 Commando and two men of the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile who were part of the Special Operations Executive. Crossing the North Sea by submarine, on arrival in Norway they attacked and damaged the plant, which was closed for the rest of the war.\n\nTo evade German search parties, the commandos split into two groups. One group of four men reached Sweden and were eventually repatriated to the United Kingdom. The second group was captured; one man died of wounds and the other seven were taken to Germany, interrogated and then executed at Sachsenhausen concentration camp.\n\nAfter the British Expeditionary Force had been evacuated from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo in 1940, the Prime Minister Winston Churchill called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale. Churchill told the joint Chiefs of Staff to propose measures for an offensive against German-occupied Europe, \"They must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class who can develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\". A staff officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke, had submitted a proposal to General Sir John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who approved Clarke's proposal. Three weeks later, the first commando raid took place. The raiders failed to gather any intelligence or damage any German equipment but killed two German sentries.\n\nNo. 2 Commando was a commando unit of the British Army. The original No. 2 Commando, unlike the other commando units, was formed from British volunteers and was always intended to be a parachute unit. On 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando was turned over to parachute duties and on 21 November, was renamed the 11th Special Air Service Battalion and eventually 1st Parachute Battalion. After its renaming as the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, a second No. 2 Commando was formed. This new No. 2 Commando was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Augustus Charles Newman, Their first action was when two Troops supported No. 3 Commando in the Vaagso Raid (Operation Archery) in December 1941, followed by the St Nazaire Raid in March 1942. The next action involving men of No. 2 Commando was Operation Musketoon. The objective was to destroy the Glomfjord power plant, south of Narvik, which supplied an aluminium plant in the area.\n\nGlomfjord power station was built at the end of Glomfjord in 1918 on a plateau dropping straight down to the sea. The plant comprised three buildings, the longest was the machinery hall, the middle building housed the control room and offices and the last building was three-storeyed and known as the apparatus house. It was a hydroelectric power station supplied by two water pipes coming down the mountain from inland lakes. Apart from the aluminium factory, the station supplied power to local villages.\n\nTwo officers and eight men from No. 2 Commando and two Norwegian corporals from the Norwegian Independent Company 1, part of the Special Operations Executive were selected for Operation Musketoon. The raid was commanded by Captain Graeme Black, from Ontario in Canada and the second in command, Captain Joseph Houghton. The other men from No. 2 Commando were Company Sergeant Major Miller Smith, Lance Sergeant Richard O'Brien, Lance Bombardier William Chudley and privates John Fairclough, Cyril Abram, Eric Curtis, Reginald Makeham and Fred Trigg. The two Norwegian corporals were Erling Djupdraet and Sverre Granlund. Before leaving for Norway, the team trained for a fortnight on a large country estate in Scotland. During the planning the commandos were supposed to be picked up after the raid by a Short Sunderland flying boat but this was cancelled before the mission, due to the risk to the aircraft and the party was to head for neutral Sweden instead. Each man was issued with special equipment, including a silk map of Norway and Sweden, a rice paper map of Russia and Norwegian Kroner notes. They also carried two compasses (one sewn into each collar tab) a hacksaw blade, a fighting knife and a Colt M1911 pistol. The only other small arm taken was a suppressed Sten gun, carried by Captain Houghton.\n\nTo transport the raiders across the North Sea, a , , belonging to the Free French Navy was used, under the command of Commander Querville. \"Junon\" was selected because in silhouette it had the appearance of a German U-boat, which could be advantageous if sighted on the surface. The submarine left the Orkney Islands at 11:40 on 11 September 1942, under escort in British waters by , and \"Thunderbolt\". \"Junon\" crossed the North Sea undetected and near Glomfjord, rose to periscope depth and discovered that a fishing boat was trailing them. The boat crash-dived but this sighting does not appear to have compromised the operation. The commander of the raid, Captain Black, had decided against a frontal assault since he suspected any German defences would expect one. The submarine entered the Bjaerangsfjord just south of Glomfjord on 15 September.\n\nThe submarine settled on the bottom of the fjord until darkness and surfaced at 21:15 to put the commandos ashore by dinghy. Reaching the shore, they hid their dinghy under some stones and moss, then set out across the mountains to Glomfjord, reaching the Black Glacier undetected. Houghton and Granlund, a Norwegian, went ahead to reconnoitre the area before the party began to climb the mountain. At one stage they had to traverse a near vertical rock face before reaching the summit. The commandos did not know that their presence was suspected. A German topographical party was in the area and its commander, \"Leutnant\" Wilhelm Dehne, had spotted some unidentified figures above the Glomfjord. Later he discovered some Player's cigarette packs and the remains of a camp. Fortunately for the commandos, his route back to Glomfjord took him away from their new camp overlooking the power station.\n\nResting in their hideout for the following day, the commandos went over their plan of attack and withdrawal from the area. They left their encampment at 20:00 (8:00 P.M.) on 17 September, to begin the attack. On their approach they detected a small craft on the fjord; fearing they would be spotted, they decided to postpone the action and return to camp. By dawn they had not been able to reach their hideout; while they were in an exposed location they still decided it would be best to stay put until nightfall. Reaching their hideout again on the night of the 18th. At this point however, the commandos were running short on supplies and Black ordered the attack to proceed the following night, 19/20 September, no matter what.\n\nThe commandos were divided into two groups for the attack. One group consisting of Lance Sergeant O'Brien, Lance Bombardier Chudley and Private Curtis were to attack two high-pressure water pipes in diameter, leading from the top of the mountain into the plant. Reaching their objective, they planted plastic explosives in a round pattern to blow a hole in the pipes. Attaching a 30-minute delayed fuse, they waited to hear the sound of explosives going off inside the plant, which was the signal to activate their fuse.\n\nThe other nine commandos had set out for the rear of the power plant; seven entered the machinery hall, leaving two commandos on guard. The commandos in the power station discovered that the Germans had left the control room and only a Norwegian engineer was on duty. Sergeant Smith and Private Fairclough were detailed to plant their explosives amongst the machinery in the power house and the other commandos located the area where the Norwegian work force worked and slept. The workers were gathered up and ordered to leave the station via an access tunnel over long, which was the only land route between the station and the villages in the fjord. On their approach to the tunnel, a German guard was killed by Granlund and another managed to run off down the tunnel to raise the alarm. As to delay German reinforcements, the commandos left smoke bombs inside the tunnel. By this time the commandos in the station had set their plastic explosives with 10-minute delay fuses on both turbines and generators.\n\nUpon hearing the explosions at the power plant, O'Brien's group detonated their explosives and both groups withdrew to the hills, just as German reinforcements were arriving at the plant. The Germans were unwilling to enter the tunnel, fearing it might be booby trapped and used boats belonging to the villagers to bypass the tunnel and reach the station. Granlund had pressed on ahead of the main group trying to find a foot bridge to aid their escape. He found a mountain hut occupied by three Norwegians whom he asked for directions; the best they could do was draw him a map. Granlund left to look again but returned to the hut soon after, being unable to find it in the dark at the same time as Houghton and the other Norwegian, Djupdraet. Unknowingly while Granlund had been away two Germans had arrived at the hut and were busy questioning the occupants. In the ensuing fight, one of the Germans was killed and the other wounded. Djupdraet was also wounded, stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet.\n\nThe remaining commandos arrived at the scene and administered first aid to Djupdraet. His wound was so severe that they decided to leave him behind to get treatment. The remaining commandos now split into two groups to evade German search parties and made their way further up the mountain. One group, consisting of O'Brien, Granlund, Fairclough and Trigg, went north around the mountains. The second group of Black, Houghton, Smith, Chudley, Curtis, Abram and Makeham, took the southern route. The second group were discovered by the Germans who opened fire, wounding Houghton in the right arm; surrounded, they were forced to surrender. The O'Brien group split up, Granlund setting off by himself; they eventually reached Sweden without further incident and all four were repatriated by aircraft to RAF Leuchars. Djupdraet died of his wounds in hospital, three days after the raid. The other seven prisoners of war were sent to Germany.\nThe unwounded prisoners sent to Colditz Castle and put into the solitary confinement, where Black managed to make contact with Flight Lieutenant Dominic Bruce RAF (known as The Medium Sized Man) giving him and others their names which were passed on to MI5 in London. Bruce was the last British person to speak to Black; on 13 October 1942 they were taken to the \"SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt\" (RHSA) headquarters in Berlin, where they were interrogated one by one by \"Obergruppenführer\" Heinrich Müller. They remained in Berlin until 22 October, when they were taken to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. On the next day, 23 October, they were shot in the back of the neck and their bodies cremated. These commandos were the first to die under the Commando Order issued on 18 October 1942 by Adolf Hitler, which called for the execution of all captured commandos. The official German story given to the Red Cross was that the seven men had escaped and not been recaptured.\n\nThe raid was considered a great success as it seemed likely that the power station would be closed for the duration of the war. After returning to the United Kingdom and a debriefing, O'Brien was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and Trigg and Fairclough were awarded Military Medals. Granlund was killed in February 1943, along with one British and four Norwegian commandos as part of Operation Seagull, when the Norwegian submarine sank off the Norwegian coast. Trigg was killed in Italy and is buried at the Cassino memorial; O'Brien and Fairclough survived the war.\n\nOn 15 November 1945, Black was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Houghton the Military Cross backdated to 22 November 1942. Black and Houghton and the other five men of Operation Musketoon are commemorated on the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp memorial plaque and the Brookwood Memorial. The Brookwood memorial is for men and women of the British and Commonwealth armies who died during the Second World War and have no known grave.\n\nThe German commander in Norway, \"Generaloberst\" Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, was captured after the war and tried by a British military court, for his part in carrying out the Commando Order. Found guilty on all eight charges of urging the forces under his command to kill men captured in commando raids or handing prisoners of war over to the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD) for execution, he was sentenced to death, which was later commuted to life imprisonment. He was released in 1953 and died in 1968.\n\n\n"}

CL Financial then became one of the largest local conglomerates in the region, encompassing over 65 companies in 32 countries worldwide with total assets exceeding US$100 billion.\n\nHowever, CL Financial experienced a liquidity crisis that resulted in a \"bail out\" agreement by which the government of Trinidad and Tobago loaned the company funds ($7.3 billion as of December 2010) to maintain its ability to operate, and obtained a majority of seats on the company's board of directors. As of late 2010, the company remained in a tenuous position amid tense negotiations with the government, and as of February 2011, the company's web site (www.clfinancial.com) was no longer functioning.\n\nCL Financial started out as a holding company for Colonial Life Insurance Company (Trinidad) Limited (Clico) in 1993.\n\nIn a \"Trinidad Guardian\" press release on January 30, 2009, it was announced that the TT Government would \"bail out\" CL Financial, the parent company of Clico, Angostura and several other local and regional businesses. Key points disclosed were:\n\nDuring a press conference held later the same day, Central Bank Governor Ewart Williams released a statement revealing that the Bank and the Ministry of Finance had taken control of the assets and liabilities of Colonial Life Insurance Company, Clico Investment Bank (CIB) and Caribbean Money Market Brokers (CMMB). The statement explained that liquidity challenges which CIB had been facing for some weeks came to a head when an unusually high level of withdrawal requests put a strain on available liquid resources. Clico was also facing liquidity problems, to a lesser extent. On January 13, 2009, Clico's Chairman formally raised the issue of possible financial assistance from the Central Bank.\n\nThe statement highlighted the contagion risks that financial difficulties in CL Financial Group could have on the overall financial system of Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean region: The Group controls over TT$100 billion of assets in at least 28 companies located throughout the Region and the world. The Group's financial interests cover several industry sectors including banking and financial services, energy, real estate and manufacturing and distribution. The four largest financial institutions in the Group manage assets of over TT$38 billion, over 25 percent of the country's GDP. The Group's holdings include the British American Insurance Company Limited, one of the main insurance companies in the Eastern Caribbean.\n\nIn the Bank's view, the financial difficulties being faced by CIB and Clico resulted from: \n\nAccording to the statement, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and the CL Financial Group have agreed to a strategy intended to deal with the liquidity challenges of CIB and Clico, and to address the underlying problems that gave rise to the current financial stress. The principal objectives are to ensure that resources are available to meet withdrawals of third-party CIB depositors and Clico policy holders, protect the funds of the depositors and policy holders, maintain public confidence in Clico and reinforce public confidence in the financial sector as a whole:\n\nThe Central Bank will: \n\nAlso, CL Financial will divest additional assets to help fund Clico's existing Statutory Fund deficit. In exchange for collateral and an equity interest in Clico, the Government will provide any additional funding needed to eliminate this deficit, and will \"act as a catalyst\" for Clico to implement changes to its business model and corporate governance structure - \"The intention will be to return Clico to its original moorings\".\n\nMr Williams emphasized that CIB depositors' funds are safe, and assured Clico's policy holders that the long-term future of Clico will be guaranteed. He also emphasized the tremendous strength of the TT financial system, \"the envy of the region\", and pointed out that, in contrast to the illiquidity of CIB, the rest of the TT banking system is experiencing excess liquidity, an impressively low percentage of non-performing loans, and a more than adequate level of provisions against bad loans.\nMr Williams acknowledged the cooperation received from Mr. Duprey and the CL Financial Group, recognized First Citizens Bank for its role, cautioned the entire financial sector to \"let competition take a back seat\" and support the Government in keeping Clico as a functioning entity, and called for the support of the community of depositors and policyholders.\n\nMrs Karen Nunez-Tesheira, T&T Minister of Finance, also made a statement describing the urgency with which the government and the Bank is pursuing changes to the regulatory framework governing financial institutions, and reiterating government's commitment to protecting depositors.\n\nA memorandum of understanding (MOU) describing the intended actions, also dated January 30, was signed by the Minister of Finance (on behalf of the Government) and Lawrence Duprey (acting for CL Financial Limited and its affiliates). According to the MOU, the threat was the financial condition of three companies: Colonial Life Insurance Company Trinidad Limited (CLICO Trinidad), CLICO Investment Bank Limited (CIB) and British American Insurance Company Trinidad Limited (BA Trinidad). In return for Government protection of the interest of depositors, policy holders and creditors of these three institutions, CL Financial agreed to sell its Republic Bank shareholdings, its MHTL shareholdings, its CMMB Shareholdings, and any other assets as required.\n\nAccording to the Trinidad Express, Winston Dookeran, Congress of the People (COP) leader and former Central Bank governor, said Central Bank Governor Ewart Williams, First Citizens CEO Larry Howai, CL Financial chairman Lawrence Duprey and Finance Minister Karen Nunez-Tesheira had \"delivered a damning indictment of their collective stewardship while trying to distract the nation with a pathetic display of self congratulation at their ability to speak with the same forked tongue\". He expressed concern that the Governor was unable to state the size of the financial hole to be plugged at CLICO. The Trinidad Express also noted that the \"meltdown\" leaves the TT $12 billion Essar Steel Caribbean Limited (ESCL), an India-based foreign investment project, in limbo - including the associated natural gas supply contract which was expected to boost revenues of the National Gas Company by eight per cent.\n\nThe Jamaica Observer report on the rescue noted that in 2008 CL Financial purchased an 86.6 per cent stake in Lascelles de Mercado (parent company of Appleton Jamaica Rum), and also bought a 40 per cent stake in Caribbean Money Market Brokers from Jamaica Money Market Brokers.\n\nIn Barbados, the Nation Newspaper reported that Leroy Parris, chairman of CLICO Holdings Barbados Limited,\nsought to allay fears among policyholders and other investors. Parris said what had occurred in Trinidad \"had no effect on Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean\". Parris stressed that the Bajan company was autonomous and its management structure, balance sheets and auditing were totally separate. \"CLICO in Barbados is separate from the Trinidad and Tobago operation which is supervised by the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance. In Barbados, CLICO is supervised by the Supervisor of Insurance and the Ministry of Finance. We are regulated by Barbados and the Barbados Government,\" he stated.
