Like many young activists of his generation he attended the Central Labour College in London from 1923–25, where he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. During the 1926 General Strike he was imprisoned for three months in Swansea Prison for his trade union activities in the Nottinghamshire coalfield.\n\nOnce back at the pits, he became chairman and then checkweighman of the Cambrian Lodge of the South Wales Miners Federation. Although often seen as a lesser post to that of Lodge Chairman, in a time of industrial unrest the checkweighman was a vital part of the miners' protection against employers using piece work rules to drive down wages, and it was a role in which Jones was likely to routinely come into conflict with management.\n\nIn 1929, he resigned, refusing to work with 'scab' (non-unionised) labour. He remained unemployed for the rest of his life, although, he was likely to be permanently busy on political business. He was extremely popular amongst the rank-and-file Party members, but his association with \"Hornerism\" (Communists working within established trades unions), his turbulent private life and his distrust of the cult of personality (he was sent home from the Soviet Union for ignoring a standing ovation to Joseph Stalin) meant that he was repeatedly suspended and disciplined by the Party. As the Welsh organiser for the National Unemployed Workers Movement, widely regarded as a Communist front, he led the 1932, 1934 and 1936 hunger marches to London. Also in 1936, he was elected as one of the two Communist members on to the Glamorgan County Council. In South Wales at this time his attachment to the Communist Party would not have harmed his reputation as a political activist and leader.\n\nLewis Jones died on 27 January 1939 at the end of a day in which he addressed over 30 meetings in support of the republican side of the Spanish Civil War. He is buried at \"Trealaw Cemetery\" in Trealaw.\n\nHis books provide a description of life in a Welsh mining community of their time; there is an awareness of the crisis of masculinity that mass unemployment brought home to those communities, and the description of workers in struggle with their employers is unflinching in its acknowledgement of defeat as well as victory.\n\nBy Lewis Jones:\n\nOn Lewis Jones:\n\n"}

His family moved to Albany, New York in 1866. Starting at a young age, Ochtman worked as a draftsman at a wood-working firm in Albany. In 1879, Ochtman moved from Albany to New York City where he roomed with fellow painter, Charles Warren Eaton.\n\nIn New York City, Ochtman worked with a group of artists who were important in the development of the impressionist movement in the United States. Although he took classes at the Art Students League of New York in 1879, he was primarily self-taught. For several years Ochtman's studio in New York City was located in the same building as that of George Inness, the dean of the Tonalism movement, and the two painters admired each other's work. In 1882 he began to exhibit landscapes at the National Academy of Design. He traveled to Europe in 1886, where he was influenced by the Dutch Hague School painters Jacob Maris and Anton Mauve. He returned to New York in 1887. He became a National Academician in 1904. His most characteristic pictures are scenes on Long Island Sound and the Connecticut countryside.\n\nOchtman and his wife, the accomplished American Impressionist painter Mina Fonda Ochtman (1862–1924), moved to Mianus, Connecticut in 1891, where they became founding members of the Cos Cob Art Colony.

Many of these channels share common programs. Rogers TV broadcasts in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario. Rogers TV is available only in communities served by Rogers' cable and telecom division, and is not carried by other television services providers. Its French counterpart is TV Rogers.\n\nRogers TV serves over 2.3 million cable subscribers. Programming on the channels is produced with the assistance of volunteers and community partners and associations, who assist, with the production and content of these programs.\n\nHistorically Rogers TV channels have been run as local public-access television channels; whereas some stations are still run as community access, most stations are run as community stations where production is done in-house with community involvement, or produced by local production studios that provide their shows to be aired by Rogers TV.\n\nIn April 2008, the company re-branded itself from Rogers Television to the simpler Rogers TV (TV Rogers for the French-language stations). As with most re-branding initiatives, it included a new logo (seen to the side), a revamped website, on-air graphics elements and new paint schemes for the network's large fleet of production vehicles. Some media critics speculated that the name change was done to bring the cable channels into line with the rest of Rogers Communications' media properties, notably Omni Television and the Citytv network. \n\nIn 2017 Rogers TV stations in the Greater Toronto Area closed as part of budget reallocations; this came in response to new CRTC regulations, allowing companies that co-own broadcast stations and cable providers in a metropolitan market to divert the mandatory funding for community channels to support local news operations for their broadcast stations.\n\nThis programming was created in response to older Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations which previously required that cable companies produce content reflecting the local community. Rogers TV annually receives applications from the community for new shows, and are reviewed by individual station managers and producers to access which programs can be produced with given production capabilities, likelihood of sponsorship, willingness of community involvement, and uniqueness of programming as major considerations. And because of CRTC requirements, the majority of the programs are produced in the local region of the station, while others are produced in neighbouring studios.\n\nSome programs feature local journalists from radio, print and TV media. The programs are occasionally derivative of mainstream commercial fare with emphasis on the communities the stations are in.\n\nIn New Brunswick, Rogers TV operates nine distinct community channels. Rogers offers French-language community channels (TV Rogers) in Edmundston, Bathurst, the Acadian Peninsula and Moncton, as well as English-language community channels in Fredericton, Saint John, Moncton, Miramichi and Bathurst. The programming shown on Rogers TV channels is a mix of access programming produced by the general public, and licensee programming originating from Rogers staff. Topics include political programming, sports coverage, live bingo shows, entertainment series, election coverage, telethons, municipal council coverage, documentaries and specials.\n\nNotable examples of past successes include Acadieman – the world’s first animated Acadian superhero; the Afternoon News with Tom Young – a simulcast of the popular Rogers Radio show; 2 Bon’Heures – the region’s only early-morning French-language studio talk show; and First Local – a live, daily 15 minute news show with stories from around the province.\n\nCable companies have been offering community channels in New Brunswick for 40 years. Fundy Cable started setting up community channels in Saint John and Edmundston in the early 1970s. Shaw Cable acquired the New Brunswick cable licenses from Fundy Cable in 1998. Rogers TV in New Brunswick was formerly known as TVNB, a group of local community programming stations that became in 1998 the first provincial programming network in Canada not owned by a provincial government. Rogers and Shaw exchanged assets in the year 2000, and the stations were re-branded to Rogers Television shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\nSome programming is also available on the digital \"Rogers On Demand\" service.\n\n\n\n\nRogers also owns a stake in Cable 14, a community channel in Hamilton, Ontario co-owned with Cogeco and Source Cable.\n\n"}

Wessem is a part of the municipality of Maasgouw. As of 2002, Wessem had a population of 1,750.\n\nHistorical Wessem is more than a thousand years old.\n\nLittle is known about the early history. The name sounds Frankish and excavation show that it was inhabited in pre-Roman times. It was inhabited in that time by the Eburones, a Belgic tribe based on north-eastern Gaul in the 1st century BC. Julius Caesar described them as being of Germanic origin. They are believed to have lived between the Meuse and Rhine rivers. Ambiorix, an Eburonian chief, is known for having led a rebellion against the Romans in 54 BC. Because of this rebellion the Eburones were all but exterminated by the Romans and their land was destroyed. They were replaced by the Tungri, a Germanic tribe that was Celticised but in villages on the other side of the river Meuse the Eburones continued to exist what would explain the fact that the Limburgs language spoken on the west bank of the river Meuse still has some traces of the old Celtic language spoken by the Eburones.\n\nThe first written proof of Wessem's existence found, according to Baron Louis de Crassier in his \"Dictionnaire\" is in a Charter of 946, when Emperor Otto I confirmed to the abbey of Gembloux, the possession in Wessem of a mill and a brewery.\n\nThere was also a relationship with the abbey of St. Pantaleon in Cologne since bishop Bruno left all his assets, rights and possessions in the \"hof Wessem\" to the abbey in his last will and testament in 946.\n\nIn 946 Wessem acquired the right to make their own coins, collect taxes and to choose a guardian and a mayor. In the 12th century BC, Wessem received full city rights and from then on suffered the same fate as so many small communities in Limburg. Through marriages, agreements, war and inheritancies and legacies, Wessem was owned by one noble family after another. For example, in 1219 Willem I van Horn acquired Wessem as a guardian. The reign of the van Horne’s lasted until 1568 when Philips van Montmorency together with Lamoraal van Egmond were decapitated in Brussel by Spanish noblemen.\n\nIn style with local customs at the time the executors received the victims' possessions and Wessem became Gelders. The Lords of Gelre en Gulick received all possessions of the Lords of Horne. Horn in contemporary Dutch and Hör in Limburgs, is still a small town very near to Wessem on the banks of the river Meusenad even the castle still exists and descendants of the noble family still live there.\n\nIn this period Wessem was a small town with fortifications. It had its own courtroom and jurisdiction, and being the main town in the \"Land van Horne\" (The land of the Lords of Horne), it had jurisdiction over most of the other towns in the Land van Horne.\n\nIn 1609 the confiscations granted to the lords of Gelre en Gulick expired. The princes of Chimay took possession of Wessem in 1620, a reign that would until the French Revolutionary Army arrived in 1790.\n\nSituated strategically on the banks of the busy river Meuse and on most main roads in Limburg, Wessem's economy boomed in the 17th century. It was an important centre for trade and shipping. Relics from that time can still be seen in the form of big warehouses and storage-barns. The old city centre is well preserved and show Wessem's riches in those days.\n\nThe arrival of the French in 1790 preluded a harsh time for Wessem. The government and jurisdiction were changed at the will of the new rulers. The community had a love-hate relationship with the French Empire and flourished until in the years after the downfall of Emperor Napoleon I, Wessem became a part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, a status it still has nowadays with a short interval in the years 1830-1839, when it chose the side of the Belgians in their independence struggle against the deceitful Dutch. The Dutch occupied Wessem because of its strategic importance and Wessem became a part of the Netherlands.\n\nWessem was a separate municipality until 1991, when it was merged with Heel.\n\nAll in all, Wessem had a very quiet history, which can be seen by walking through the old centre with a unique network of little streets paved with maaskeitjes (small square stones found in the river Meuse).\n\nA must-see in Wessem is the former city hall with Wessems main square. A mosaic of maaskeitjes shows the city-crest. The Roman church, built in 964, was destroyed by the Germans in 1914, but has been restored to its former glory.\n\nWessem still has one of the best sjutterie (schutterij in Dutch, Schützenverein in German), a club of riflemen, in the world and participate in the OLS (Old Limburgs rifleshooting-fair), a big, annual cultural event for Limburgian-people from every country where every Limburgian village sends a delegation, every year. In 2004 they won the OLS, and in 2005 they organised it.\n\nThe table tennis club (Westa), the soccer club (R.K.S.V.W.) and the volleyball team (VC Maasdal) belong to the top in the Netherlands.\n\n"}

A celebration of nature and culture, the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail is part of a strategy to protect and connect people to the largest group of freshwater lakes on earth. It is a legacy project of the Waterfront Regeneration Trust, a charity, and its community partners. Through Toronto, the trail is called the Martin Goodman Trail. The Waterfront Trail is also used by commuters in parts of Southern Ontario.\n\nIn October 2013, Premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne announced government support for expansion of the trail system to better connect the 2015 Pan Am Games venues and community.\n\n\"I want to ensure that all of the people of this province benefit from our investments in the Pan Am and Parapan Am Games, because that is how we can grow as One Ontario. Extending our trails system and connecting more communities is a great way for the excitement of the Games to live on well beyond 2015.\" \n\nThe announcement ensures that \"the province will work with First Nation and Métis communities and organizations to incorporate Aboriginal markers along the trails to honour the history and culture of Aboriginal communities in Ontario.\"\n\nTrails will connect to four major Pan Am and Parapan Am Games venues – CIBC Pan Am/Parapan Am Athletes' Village, CIBC Pan Am Park, CIBC Hamilton Soccer Stadium and Pan Am/Parapan Am Fields.\n\nAll consultations related to Pan Am/Parapan Am trails will address accessibility requirements under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.\n\nIn November 2013, two waterfront-design firms were selected to reimagine the space at the former Ontario Place grounds in Toronto to incorporate a broader mandate for greenspace and parkland.\n\nSince 2013, the Trail has been growing radically, with expansions along the shores of Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Georgian Bay and Lake Huron's north channel, adding over 2000km to its length.\n\nThe rising cost of automobiles and gasoline mean a heavier burden on the trail system from multiple uses.\n\n\nControversial decisions to limit some e-bike and mobility scooters have been underway along portions of the trail.\n\nRegional Municipalities connected by the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail\n\nThe rise of social travel and photography have parallelled with the rise of smaller wearable technological advancements that permits travelers along the trail a variety of activities and destinations.\n\n\nThe jewel of the Waterfront Trail lies at the Toronto Islands Ferry Terminal where trail users can catch a ferry to the expansive Toronto Islands including Centre Island and\nHanlon's Point Beach. In 2015, the Waterfront Trail is expected to connect to the huge underground Toronto PATH system. Cyclists and skaters are encouraged on the peaceful island where only utility vehicles are permitted.\n\nAmong the artistic touches of this portion of the trail include the architecturally renowned Wave Decks, designed by West8.\n\n\nThe Beaches community in eastern Toronto is an important location on the trail, being one of the only neighbourhoods in Toronto with residential homes next to the lakeshore. The Beach itself is a popular destination, hosting games of beach volleyball, and attracting many cyclists and rollerbladers. North of the waterfront are many small stores and restaurants along Queen Street and The Danforth. From the Beaches, the trail, called the Martin Goodman Trail, runs west along the Toronto waterfront for its entire length, with only a few sections on city streets. Currently, there isn't any path running east along the waterfront from the Beaches.\n\nSugar Beach is a former parking lot located at Lower Jarvis Street and Queen's Quay—the park is now a non-swimming beach on the south-eastern edge of South Core, Toronto.\n\n\nPort Credit straddles the Credit River with a mix of residential and commercial development along the trail. Most of the trail is separated from traffic with the exception of some residential streets at the east end near the Adamson Estate.\n\n\nSpencer Smith Park at Burlington is a prime example of the evolution of mixed-use development and city planning in the Greater Toronto Area. In 2006, the park became a symbol of the ongoing effort to reclaim the Lake Ontario shoreline after the latest phase of redevelopment featured the opening of Spencer's, an upscale restaurant on grounds once occupied by the Mohawk Canoe Club. In 2013, a new pier was opened by the City of Burlington that anchors the trail along the shores of the lake.\n\nIndividuals and groups can sometimes be seen performing yoga, T'ai chi and other arts at the public gazebo here. In addition, Spencer Smith Park hosts the annual Sound Of Music festival, a longtime tradition and celebration for Halton and surrounding areas.\n\nThe 1000 Islands Bikepath is a 37 kilometre trail running parallel to the Parkway between Gananoque and Brockville, forming a section of the Waterfront Trail.\n\nIn July 2014, the provincial government of Ontario announced a $100 million renovation plan that will see the transformation of Ontario Place from an entertainment venue into a huge mixed-use park that will anchor the trail in this section.\n\nNot all sections of the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail are off-road. The route is designated with existing infrastructure in place with the goal of future improvements, including a legacy goal of a completely off-road trail, as close to the water's edge as ecologically feasible. There is an effort by the Waterfront Regeneration Trust, the charity leading the partnership of communities the Trail connects, to expand and improve the route. Their partnership with local, regional, and Provincial governments has yielded several successes, including the Ministry of Transportation's addition of paved shoulders on roughly 50km of Highway 17 between Sault Ste Marie and Greater Sudbury, where the route could use no other roads.\n\n\"The Waterfront Regeneration Trail is focused on creating a cycling route around the Great Lakes, and has big expansion plans and dreams for the coming years to increase significantly its mileage.\n\nSome of the biggest deterrents for cycle tourists are poor road conditions that force cyclists into traffic and a lack of good signage.\"\n\nLength \nIncludes\n\n\n"}

Any cut determines a cut-set, the set of edges that have one endpoint in each subset of the partition. These edges are said to cross the cut. In a connected graph, each cut-set determines a unique cut, and in some cases cuts are identified with their cut-sets rather than with their vertex partitions.\n\nIn a flow network, an s–t cut is a cut that requires the \"source\" and the \"sink\" to be in different subsets, and its \"cut-set\" only consists of edges going from the source's side to the sink's side. The \"capacity\" of an s–t cut is defined as the sum of the capacity of each edge in the \"cut-set\".\n\nA cut formula_1 is a partition of formula_2 of a graph formula_3 into two subsets \"S\" and \"T\".\nThe cut-set of a cut formula_1 is the set formula_5 of edges that have one endpoint in \"S\" and the other endpoint in \"T\".\nIf \"s\" and \"t\" are specified vertices of the graph \"G\", then an \"s\"–\"t\" cut is a cut in which \"s\" belongs to the set \"S\" and \"t\" belongs to the set \"T\".\n\nIn an unweighted undirected graph, the \"size\" or \"weight\" of a cut is the number of edges crossing the cut. In a weighted graph, the value or weight is defined by the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the cut.\n\nA bond is a cut-set that does not have any other cut-set as a proper subset.\n\nA cut is \"minimum\" if the size or weight of the cut is not larger than the size of any other cut. The illustration on the right shows a minimum cut: the size of this cut is 2, and there is no cut of size 1 because the graph is bridgeless.\n\nThe max-flow min-cut theorem proves that the maximum network flow and the sum of the cut-edge weights of any minimum cut that separates the source and the sink are equal. There are polynomial-time methods to solve the min-cut problem, notably the Edmonds–Karp algorithm.\n\nA cut is \"maximum\" if the size of the cut is not smaller than the size of any other cut. The illustration on the right shows a maximum cut: the size of the cut is equal to 5, and there is no cut of size 6, or |\"E\"| (the number of edges), because the graph is not bipartite (there is an odd cycle).\n\nIn general, finding a maximum cut is computationally hard.\nThe max-cut problem is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems.\nThe max-cut problem is also APX-hard, meaning that there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme for it unless P = NP.\nHowever, it can be approximated to within a constant approximation ratio using semidefinite programming.\n\nNote that min-cut and max-cut are \"not\" dual problems in the linear programming sense, even though one gets from one problem to other by changing min to max in the objective function. The max-flow problem is the dual of the min-cut problem.\n\nThe sparsest cut problem is to bipartition the vertices so as to minimize the ratio of the number of edges across the cut divided by the number of vertices in the smaller half of the partition. This objective function favors solutions that are both sparse (few edges crossing the cut) and balanced (close to a bisection). The problem is known to be NP-hard, and the best known approximation algorithm is an formula_6 approximation due to .\n\nThe family of all cut sets of an undirected graph is known as the cut space of the graph. It forms a vector space over the two-element finite field of arithmetic modulo two, with the symmetric difference of two cut sets as the vector addition operation, and is the orthogonal complement of the cycle space. If the edges of the graph are given positive weights, the minimum weight basis of the cut space can be described by a tree on the same vertex set as the graph, called the Gomory–Hu tree. Each edge of this tree is associated with a bond in the original graph, and the minimum cut between two nodes \"s\" and \"t\" is the minimum weight bond among the ones associated with the path from \"s\" to \"t\" in the tree.\n\n"}

INCITS policy is to adopt as \"Identical\" American National Standards all ISO/IEC or ISO standards that fall within its program of work, with exceptions as outlined in our procedures. Accordingly, INCITS will adopt as \"Identical\" American National Standards all ISO/IEC or ISO standards that fall within its program of work. Similarly, INCITS will withdraw any such adopted American National Standard that has been withdrawn as an ISO/IEC or ISO International Standards.\n\nINCITS was established in 1961 as the Accredited Standards Committee X3, Information Technology'and is sponsored by Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), a trade association representing providers of information technology products and services then known as the Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (BEMA) and later renamed the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers' Association (CBEMA).

The area was first developed between the mid-1980s and early 1990s as an expansion of the Darnytsia neighborhood of the city. The name is rather symbolic than historic: it simply indicates that the area lies en route to the city of Kharkiv.\n\nThe neighborhood was a part of the \"Kharkivskyi Raion\" (administrative district) of the city until 2004, along with the neighboring areas Osokorky, Poznyaky, Bortnychi and Chervonyi Hutir - which was and still is a little ambiguous. In 2004 all these neighborhoods were included in the \"Darnytsia Raion\".\n\nLocated on the south end of the Dnieper river's left bank, the Kharkivskyi was constructed following similar apartment block plans as the Obolon district. The very same method of sand-depositing was used to level and elevate the low-land meadows. The neighborhood has many lakes and the beaches are a popular attraction. However, the trees are rare and weak (because of the sand soil) despite intensive efforts of the residents.\n\nOriginally located relatively far from the metro, the neighborhood was not seen as prestigious, but the long waiting list for apartments caused quick settlement. \nAt the time of initial development, the area contained relatively tall buildings, anywhere from nine to sixteen stories.\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s, the metro was extended to better cover the neighbourhood. Osokorky () station was opened in 1992 and Kharkivska () station was opened in 1994 .\n\nLike in other areas of Kiev, additional development began in Kharkivskyi in 2000. Modern, Western-style apartment buildings were built around the lakes, usually further towards the south and east ends of the neighborhood. The prestige of the area was also increased with the opening of shops, restaurants and cafes on and around the lakes as well as on the ground floors of apartment buildings. The metro is being extended deeper into the neighborhood, with new Boryspilska station opened in 2005, and a few more stations which were added subsequently.\n\nKharkivskyi is a 'dormitory' area specially designed as such. The only businesses found there are retail and entertainment, with no industry present.\n"}

He supported the candidature of the Orléanist Louis, Duke of Nemours, and joined in the proposal to offer the crown to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, being one of the delegates sent to London.\n\nWhen the \"Eighteen Articles\" of the Treaty of London were replaced by the Twenty-four less favorable to Belgium, he insisted on the necessity of compliance, and in 1839 he faced violent opposition to support the territorial cessions in Limburg and Luxemburg, which had remained an open question so long as the Netherlands refused to acknowledge the \"Twenty-four Articles\".\n\nHis \"Essai historique et politique sur la révolution belge\" (1838) won for him the praise of Palmerston and the cross of the Legion of Honor from French king Louis Philippe.

The Magical Girl Squad and Lennon are invited by Atelia, who demands the True Book of Spells from them. She reveals that she broke the law of the witches and had a son named Lennon by Jidan, who stole the True Book of Spells 14 years ago, much to Arusu's shock.

In 2009, a complete collection for both the TV series and the OVA called \"Tweeny Witches: True Book of Spells\" was released. In 2010, a complete collection only for the TV series called \"Tweeny Witches: Core Collection\" was released. In 2012, a complete collection for both the TV series and the OVA called \"Tweeny Witches: Complete Collection\" was released.\n\nThe anime has received mixed feedback from reviewers: Ain't It Cool News said that the anime can be thought of as a \"There will be blood\" type as well as being \"Spicy\" structurally. The review goes on to say that the anime fan should \"at least give it a try\" and \"warrants appreciation\". Rachael Carothers and Ronald J Duncan from Anime News Network both gave a good review. Ronald said that while the idea of a character traveling to another world and gaining the ability to do magic isn't original, the series is different. He stated the episodes were well paced, had a fun main character, and the artwork was beautiful. Rachael praised the art as \"extremely beautiful animation\" and background music that \"fits in so well\". Theron Martin from Anime News Network gave the first DVD a B rating for both the sub and dub and went on to say that it was a \"fresh twist on a well-established genre\" but it raised animation shortcuts to annoying new levels. Chris Beveridge from Mania.com gave the DVD a mixed review with a C rating. Chris went on to say that the story was \"slow moving and stilted\"; however, he went on to say that his eight-year-old daughter was \"plenty fascinated by it\", something the creator was aiming at. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network gave the 2nd DVD a B− for both the sub and dub and went on to say that the animation was great and the lead character was \"lively\" but that the direction was \"cold and over complex\". The third DVD received a C+ rating from him for both dub and sub, again the artwork was praised but the story was lacking a great deal. For the OVA Carl gave it a B− rating again for both sub and dub. The OVA was praised for its fast pace, action, and adventure, but is \"too somber and slow\".\n\nChris Beveridge from Maina.com gave the 2nd DVD a better review stating that the \"imagery presented, especially towards the end, was very grandiose and epic\" but again cited the pacing of the story as a flaw. For the 3rd and final DVD Chris stated that the ending felt \"pretty complete\" and was \"fairly predictable\". He later went on to say that the best moments tended to come with the secondary characters but overall did not capture or hold his attention. Chris rated the OVA as being lighter and more accessible nut at times going over the top, in all the review was good. Chris has placed the anime at #4 of the 10 most underrated anime. Mark Thomas from Mania.com said it is something that parents could get into with their children, and a \"little bit of Harry Potter, mixed with some Don Bluth, add a dash of Ralph Bakshi.\" makes it an odd, but fun, combination.\n\n"}
{"id": "2180530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180530", "title": "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", "text": "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\n\n\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" is an article, written in 1991 by U.S. investigative journalist Richard Behar, which is highly critical of Scientology.\n\nIt was first published by \"Time\" magazine on May 6, 1991, as an eight-page cover story, and was later published in \"Reader's Digest\" in October 1991. Behar had previously published an article on Scientology in \"Forbes\" magazine. He stated that he was investigated by attorneys and private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology while researching the \"Time\" article, and that investigators contacted his friends and family as well. Behar's article covers topics including L. Ron Hubbard and the development of Scientology, its controversies over the years and history of litigation, conflict with psychiatry and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the suicide of Noah Lottick, its status as a religion, and its business dealings.\n\nAfter the article's publication, the Church of Scientology mounted a public relations campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in \"USA Today\" for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on \"Nightline\" about what he considered to be an objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued \"Reader's Digest\" in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.\n\nBehar received awards in honor of his work on the article, including the Gerald Loeb Award, the Worth Bingham Prize, and the Conscience-in-Media Award. The article has had ramifications in the current treatment of Scientology in the media, with some publications theorizing that journalists are wary of the litigation that Time Warner went through. The article has been cited by Anderson Cooper on CNN, in a story on \"Panorama\" 2007 program \"Scientology and Me\" on the BBC, and has been used as a reference for background on the history of Scientology, in books from both the cult and new religious movement perspectives.\n\nBefore penning \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\", Behar had written a 1986 article in \"Forbes\" magazine, \"The Prophet and Profits of Scientology\", which reported on the Church of Scientology's business dealings and L. Ron Hubbard's financial success. Behar wrote that during research for \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\", he and a \"Time\" contributing editor were themselves investigated by ten attorneys and six private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology. According to Behar, investigators contacted his friends and previous coworkers to ask them if he had a history of tax or drug problems, and obtained a copy of his personal credit report that had been obtained illegally from a national credit bureau. Behar conducted 150 interviews in the course of his research for the article.\n\nBehar wrote that the motive of these operatives was to \"threaten, harass and discredit him\". He later learned that the Church of Scientology had assigned its head private investigator to direct the Church's investigation into Behar. \"Anderson Cooper 360°\" reported that Behar had been contacted by Church of Scientology attorneys numerous times while doing research on the article. The parents of Noah Lottick, a Scientologist who had committed suicide, cooperated with \"Time\" and \"Reader's Digest\".\n\nThe full title of the article is \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power: Ruined lives. Lost fortunes. Federal crimes. Scientology poses as a religion but is really a ruthless global scam — and aiming for the mainstream\". The article reported on the founding of the Church of Scientology by L. Ron Hubbard and controversies involving the Church and its affiliated business operations, as well as the suicide of a Scientologist. The article related the May 11, 1990, suicide of Dr. Edward Lottick's son Noah Antrim Lottick. Lottick was a Russian studies student who had taken a series of Scientology courses; he died after jumping from a hotel tenth floor window. The Church of Scientology and Lottick's family have differing positions on the effect Scientology coursework had on him. While none of the parties assigned blame, they expressed misgivings about his death. Initially, his father had thought that Scientology was similar to Dale Carnegie's self-improvement techniques; however, after his ordeal, the elder Lottick came to believe that the organization is a \"school for psychopaths\". Mike Rinder, the head of the Church of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs and a Church spokesman, stated \"I think Ed Lottick should look in the mirror ... I think Ed Lottick made his son's life intolerable\".\n\nThe article outlined a brief history of Scientology, discussing Hubbard's initial background as a science fiction writer, and cited a California judge who had deemed Hubbard a \"pathological liar\". The Church of Scientology's litigation history was described, in addition to its conflicts with the Internal Revenue Service, with countries regarding whether or not to accept it as a religion, and its position against psychiatry. Behar wrote of the high costs involved in participation in the Church of Scientology, what he referred to as \"front groups and financial scams\", and harassment of critics. He estimated that the Church of Scientology paid US$20 million annually to over one hundred attorneys. Behar maintained that though the Church of Scientology portrays itself as a religion, it was actually a \"hugely profitable global racket\" which intimidated members and critics in a Mafia-like manner.\n\nCynthia Kisser, then director of the Cult Awareness Network, was quoted: \"Scientology is quite likely the most ruthless, the most classically terroristic, the most litigious and the most lucrative cult the country has ever seen. No cult extracts more money from its members\".\n\nThe Church of Scientology responded to the publication of \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" by taking out color full-page ads in \"USA Today\" in May and June 1991, on every weekday for twelve weeks, denouncing the \"Time\" magazine cover article. Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled \"Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991, Issues of \"Time Magazine\"\", and \"The Story That \"Time\" Couldn't Tell\". Prior to the advertising campaign, Scientologists distributed 88-page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar's article. The \"Fact vs. Fiction\" piece was a booklet, which criticized Behar's article and asserted \"Behar's article omits the information on the dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists ... which have been acknowledged by community officials\". One of the advertisements in \"USA Today\" accused \"Time\" of promoting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, and featured a 1936 issue of \"Time\" which had Hitler's picture on the front cover. The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning \"Time\" \"horrible history of supporting fascism\", and said that the article was written because \"Time\" had been pressured by \"vested interests\". When asked by the \"St. Petersburg Times\" whether this was the case, \"Time\" Executive Editor Richard Duncan responded \"Good Lord, no\". Heber Jentzsch, at the time president of Church of Scientology International, issued a four-page news release which stated \"Advertising is the only way the church could be assured of getting its message and its side of the story out to the public without the same vested interests behind the Time article distorting it\".\n\nAfter the advertising run critiquing \"Time\" magazine in \"USA Today\" had completed, the Church of Scientology mounted a $3 million public relations campaign about Scientology in \"USA Today\", in June 1991. The Church of Scientology placed a 48-page advertising supplement in 1.8 million copies of \"USA Today\". In a statement to the \"St. Petersburg Times\", Scientology spokesman Richard Haworth explained \"What we are trying to do is put the actual facts of Dianetics and Scientology out there\".\n\nIn response to the Church of Scientology's claims of inaccuracies in the article, a lawyer for \"Time\" responded \"We've reviewed all of their allegations, and find nothing wrong with the \"Time\" story.\" In June 1991, \"Newsweek\" reported that staffers for \"Time\" said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a paralegal for \"Time\", who asked them if they had signed a confidentiality form about the article. \"Time\" editors sent staffers a computer memo, warning them about calls related to the article, and staffers told \"Newsweek\" that \"sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time\". A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims \"scurrilous\".\n\nOn February 14, 1992, Scientology leader David Miscavige gave Ted Koppel his first interview on Scientology on the ABC News program \"Nightline\". The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar's 1991 article. Behar appeared on the program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the organization's \"ulterior motive\" is really to get people to take high-priced audit counseling. Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records. Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the \"Time\" magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in \"USA Today\". Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the \"Time\" article, and the rest of the twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the \"Time\" article, and Miscavige called Behar \"a hater\". Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the \"Time\" piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to \"kidnap Scientologists out\". Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was \"missing the issue\", and said that his real point was that he thought the article was not an objective piece.\n\nMiscavige alleged on \"Nightline\" that the article itself was published as a result of a request by Eli Lilly and Company, because of \"the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac\". When Koppel asked Miscavige if he had affidavits or evidence to this effect, Miscavige responded \"You think they'd admit it?\" Miscavige stated that \"Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750,000 copies of \"Time\" magazine before it came out\", and that his attempts to investigate the matter with Eli Lilly and associated advertising companies were not successful.\n\nThe Church brought a libel lawsuit against Time Warner and Behar, seeking damages of $416 million. The Church alleged false and defamatory statements were made concerning the Church of Scientology International in the \"Time\" article. More specifically, the Church of Scientology's court statements claimed that Behar had been refining an anti-Scientology focus since his 1986 article in \"Forbes\", which included gathering negative materials about Scientology, and \"never accepting anything a Scientologist said and uniformly ignoring anything positive he learned about the Church\". In its initial complaint filing, the Church quoted portions of the Behar article that it alleged were false and defamatory, including the quote from Cynthia Kisser, and Behar's own assertion that Scientology was a \"global racket\" that intimidated individuals in a \"Mafia-like manner\".\nNoah Lottick's parents submitted affidavits in the case, in which they \"affirmed the accuracy of each statement in the article\"; Edward Lottick \"concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations, and that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral\" of their son. During the litigation, the Church of Scientology attempted to subpoena Behar in a separate ongoing lawsuit with the Internal Revenue Service, and accused a federal magistrate of leaking information to him. Behar was questioned for over 190 hours during 30 days of depositions with Scientology attorneys in the libel case. One question was about Behar's life in his parents' home while he was still inside the womb. \"St. Petersburg Times\" explained that this question was prompted by Scientology teachings that certain problems come from prenatal memories. Behar told the \"St. Petersburg Times\" he \"felt it was extremely excessive\". In a countersuit, Behar brought up the issues of Church of Scientology private investigators and what he viewed as harassment. By July 1996, all counts of the libel suit had been dismissed. In the course of the litigation through 1996, Time Warner had spent $7.3 million in legal defense costs. The Church of Scientology also sued several individuals quoted in the \"Time\" article.\n\nThe Church of Scientology sued \"Reader's Digest\" in Switzerland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany for publishing a condensed version of the \"Time\" story. The only court to provide a temporary injunction was in Lausanne, Switzerland. In France, Italy, and the Netherlands, the courts either dismissed the Church of Scientology's motions, or set injunction hearings far beyond the date of actual publication. The company defied the injunction and mailed copies of the article, \"Scientology: A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream\", to their . Worldwide editor-in-chief of \"Reader's Digest\", Kenneth Tomlinson, told \"The New York Times\" that \"a publisher cannot accept a court prohibiting distribution of a serious journalistic piece. ... The court order violates freedom of speech and freedom of the press\". The Church of Scientology subsequently filed a criminal complaint against the \"Digest\" in Lausanne, and Mike Rinder stated it was in blatant violation of the law. By defying the Swiss court ban, the \"Reader's Digest\" risked a fine of about $3,400, as well as a potential three months' jail time for the Swiss \"Digest\" editor-in-chief. A hearing on the injunction was set for November 11, 1991, and the injunction was later lifted by the Swiss court.\nIn January 2001, a United States federal appeals court upheld the dismissal of the Church of Scientology International's case against Time Warner. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" with an actual intent of malice, a standard that must be met for libel cases involving individuals and public groups. On October 1, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church's libel case \"Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner Inc.\", 00-1683. Time Warner said it refused to be \"intimidated by the church's apparently limitless legal resources.\" In arguments presented to the Supreme Court, the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had \"committed improper acts\" in the past, but also claimed that: \"allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted, the result of the misunderstanding, suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion\". Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they \"provide a safe harbor for biased journalism\". Behar commented on the Church of Scientology's legal defeat, and said that the lawsuit had a chilling effect: \"It's a tremendous defeat for Scientology ... But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass, not to win, so from that perspective they hurt us all. They've had a real chilling effect on journalism, both before and after my piece\".\n\nAs a result of writing the piece, Behar was presented with the 1992 Gerald Loeb Award for distinguished business and financial journalism, the Worth Bingham Prize, the Conscience-in-Media Award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors, awarded to \"those who have demonstrated singular commitment to the highest principles of journalism at notable personal cost or sacrifice,\" and the Cult Awareness Network's Leo J. Ryan Award, in honor of Congressman Leo J. Ryan. Paulette Cooper was also awarded the 1992 Conscience-in-Media Award by the American Society of Journalists and Authors, for her book \"The Scandal of Scientology\". This was the only time in the history of the American Society of Journalists and Authors that the award was presented to more than one journalist in the same year.\n\nIn a February 1992 issue of \"Time\", editor Elizabeth Valk congratulated Behar on his Conscience-in-Media Award, stating \"Needless to say, we are delighted and proud\". Valk noted that the honor had only been awarded seven times in the previous seventeen years of its existence. Managing editor Henry Muller also congratulated Behar in an April 1992 issue of \"Time\".\n\n\"Insane Therapy\" noted that Scientology \"achieved more notoriety ... with the publication of the journalist Richard Behar's highly critical article\". \"Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality\" described the cover design of the article as it appeared in \"Time\", writing that it \"shouted\" the headline from the magazine cover. In a 2005 piece, \"Salon.com\" magazine noted that for those interested in the Church of Scientology, the \"Time\" article still remains a \"milestone in news coverage\", and that those who back the Church believe it was \"an outrageously biased account\".\n\nThe Church of Scientology's use of private investigators was cited in a 1998 article in the \"Boston Herald\", and compared to Behar's experiences when researching \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\". After the paper ran a five-part series of critical articles in 1998, Church of Scientology President Heber Jentzsch confirmed that a private investigative firm was hired to look into the personal life of Joseph Mallia, the reporter who wrote the articles. In a later piece titled \"Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter—Investigation follows pattern of harassment\" this investigation was likened to Behar's assertions of harassment, as well as other reporters' experiences from 1974, 1988, and 1997.\n\nBecause of the history of conflict between \"Reader's Digest\" and Scientology, the writer of a 2005 cover story on Tom Cruise agreed to certain demands, including giving Scientology issues equal play in the writer's profile of Cruise, submitting questions for Cruise to Church of Scientology handlers, and sending the writer of the article to a one-day Church immersion course. Also in 2005, an article in \"Salon\" questioned whether the tactics of the Church's litigation and private investigations of Time Warner and other media sources had succeeded in decreasing the amount of investigative journalism pieces on Scientology in the press. A 2005 article in \"The Sunday Times\" cited the article, and came to the determination that the Church of Scientology's lawsuit against Time Warner \"served to warn off other potential investigations\", and that \"The chill evidently lingers still\".\n\n\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" continues to be used today by journalists in the media, as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology. In April 2007, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper interviewed former Office of Special Affairs director Mike Rinder, in a live piece on \"Anderson Cooper 360°\" titled \"Inside Scientology\". The CNN story was prompted by the May 2007 airing of a BBC \"Panorama\" investigative program, \"Scientology and Me\". In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" article, when asking Rinder about the history of Operation Snow White, and if those tactics were currently used by the Church. Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was \"ancient history\". Cooper then again referenced the \"Time\" magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article. Cooper questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against Time Warner, and Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually rejected.\n\nThe article has been cited as a reference used for background on Scientology in books which take a critical look at cults such as \"Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality\" and \"Insane Therapy: Portrait of a Psychotherapy Cult\", those that analyze new religious movements including \"Understanding New Religious Movements\" and \"The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements\", and in a work that includes researchers from both schools of thought, \"Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field\".\n\n"}

A tweener has a set of skills that do not match the traditional position of his physical stature.\n\nNBA.com's definition of \"tweener\" is as follows:\n\nA player who is ideally suited to play two positions is sometimes referred to as a swingman, although that term is more commonly reserved specifically for those who are suited to play small forward and shooting guard.\n\nThis tweener has the skills of either a center or a power forward, but is usually stronger than traditional power forwards and quicker and often more skilled than traditional centers, and is generically called a \"big\" or \"big man\" in American basketball, where the distinction between power forwards and centers has become increasingly blurred. Many times C/PF tweeners are used to create match-up problems. Usually, this tweener will have a power forward’s inside shooting abilities and a center’s height or blocking abilities. Amar'e Stoudemire is an example of a tweener. Other prominent NBA players who switch between power forward and center are Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Pau Gasol, Chris Bosh, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, David Lee, and Anthony Davis, among others. A good example of such a Euroleague player is Mike Batiste.\n\nTraditionally, a SF/PF tweener refers to a basketball player whose physical attributes and skills render him/her unsuited to play either the small forward position or the power forward position exclusively. For example, the player may be not athletic enough or perhaps lacking proper ball handling/shooting skills to play small forward; while lacking sufficient strength or height to play the power forward position effectively. On the other hand, the player may have the skills to play either forward position, but does not necessarily fit either of them exclusively. They can be too big for most opposing small forwards to guard them and have a skill set that small forwards traditionally have (ex. outside scoring ability).\n\nSome examples of current and former players in the NBA are Draymond Green, Xavier McDaniel, Andre Roberson, James McAdoo, Michael Beasley, Lamar Odom, Josh Smith, Thaddeus Young, Shawn Marion, Antoine Walker, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Keith Van Horn, Rashard Lewis, Antawn Jamison, Gerald Wallace, Al Harrington, Carmelo Anthony, and Kevin Durant. Typical examples of European combo forwards with careers on both sides of the Atlantic are the now retired Toni Kukoč and Andrei Kirilenko. A good example of such a player in the Euroleague is Panayiotis Vasilopoulos, just like Fragiskos Alvertis used to be during his playing years with Panathinaikos BC. Another example is Spanish player Jorge Garbajosa. Perhaps the archetypal \"cornerwoman\" in women's basketball is Candace Parker, who was listed on the roster of her college team as a center, forward, and guard.\n\nThis tweener is not suited to exclusively play either at shooting guard or small forward. For example, he may be too short to play small forward, but lacks a guard's jumper or ball-handling skills to play the two-man. To counter this, this tweener could play as a swingman.\n\nSome swingmen have been known to play both the small forward and shooting guard position effectively, having the size and strength to play the small forward position, as well as the outside jump shot and quickness to play the shooting guard position, such as Kobe Bryant, Jimmy Butler or Michael Jordan. These tweeners are known to cause match up problems, and have proven to be very difficult to guard. Such NBA players are Kobe Bryant, Jimmy Butler, Josh Howard, Andre Iguodala, Jason Richardson, Manu Ginóbili, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Shane Battier, Jaylen Brown, and Tracy McGrady. One WNBA example is Elena Delle Donne, who has been listed as a guard and forward throughout her WNBA career despite being similar in size to most of the league's centers (6'5\"/1.96 m). A good such example for a Euroleague player is Ramūnas Šiškauskas.\n\n\"Tweener\" may also describe a player who combines the attributes of a shooting guard and point guard, but does not fit the prototype of either position. Such guards usually play a shooting-guard-type game (looking more to score than to pass) but lack the height to guard opposing shooting guards effectively and some of the skills to direct an offense that a \"pure\" point would display. Such players are also known as \"combination (or combo) guards\". However, after the success of Dwyane Wade during the 2004-05 NBA season, there has been less stigma attached to the term and many current elite prospects are combo guards, such as Derrick Rose, Randy Foye, Eric Gordon, O. J. Mayo, Goran Dragić, and Russell Westbrook. Most commonly, shooting guards are called \"tweeners\" when considered too short for NBA-level starting competition at the position. This generally is applied to shooting guards that are 6'3\" and below in height. Conversely, they lack the full skillset of a point guard. These players are often referred to as being \"a shooting guard trapped in a point guard's body.\" Some good examples of this are Allen Iverson, Victor Oladipo, Kirk Hinrich, Stephon Marbury, Delonte West, Monta Ellis, Gilbert Arenas, Jason Terry, Ben Gordon, Jamal Crawford, Juan Dixon, Steve Francis, Calvin Murphy, Eddie House, John Paxson, Steve Kerr, Danny Ainge, Aaron Brooks and Luther Head. This is in stark contrast to pass-first type point guards who traditionally play the position such as Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Isiah Thomas, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Deron Williams and Ricky Rubio. Some players, for example Tyreke Evans, Greivis Vasquez, James Harden, and Rodney Stuckey, have the requisite size for a shooting guard (around 6'5\" or 6'6\"), but because of their above-average passing and playmaking ability, they are used as combo guards.\n\nSome NBA players, most notably players like Luka Doncic, Boris Diaw, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen, Grant Hill, Lamar Odom, Magic Johnson, Draymond Green, James Johnson, Blake Griffin, LeBron James, Nicolas Batum, Gordon Hayward, Ben Simmons, Pascal Siakam, and Giannis Antetokounmpo, possess the size, strength and rebounding skills to play a forward position, yet they also have the passing and ball-handling skills, along with the \"basketball IQ\", to perform at the point guard position. These players often cause match-up problems on both ends of the court, because while the tall, strong point forward can dominate a traditional point guard on the offensive end of the court, he is sometimes at a disadvantage on the defensive end against smaller, quicker guards.\n"}

The cases formula_2 and formula_3 were proved by Tibor Radó and Edwin E. Moise in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively.\n\nAn obstruction to the manifold version was formulated by Andrew Casson and Dennis Sullivan in 1967–69 (originally in the simply-connected case), using the Rochlin invariant and the cohomology group formula_4.\n\nA homeomorphism formula_5 of \"m\"-dimensional piecewise linear manifolds has an invariant formula_6 such that for formula_7, formula_8 is isotopic to a piecewise linear (PL) homeomorphism if and only if formula_9. In the simply-connected case and with formula_7, formula_8 is homotopic to a PL homeomorphism if and only if formula_12.\n\nThe obstruction to the manifold Hauptvermutung is now seen as a relative version of the triangulation obstruction of Robion Kirby and Laurent C. Siebenmann, obtained in 1970. The Kirby–Siebenmann obstruction is defined for any compact \"m\"-dimensional topological manifold \"M\"\nagain using the Rochlin invariant. For formula_14, the manifold \"M\" has a PL structure (i.e., it can be triangulated by a PL manifold) if and only if formula_15, and if this obstruction is 0, the PL structures are parametrized by formula_16. In particular there are only a finite number of essentially distinct PL structures on \"M\".\n\nFor compact simply-connected manifolds of dimension 4, Simon Donaldson found examples with an infinite number of inequivalent PL structures, and Michael Freedman found the E8 manifold which not only has no PL structure, but (by work of Casson) is not even homeomorphic to a simplicial complex.\n\nIn 2013, Ciprian Manolescu proved that there exist compact topological manifolds of dimension 5 (and hence of any dimension greater than 5) that are not even homeomorphic to a simplicial complex. Thus Casson's example illustrates a more general phenomenon that is not merely limited to dimension 4.\n\n"}

In addition to playing the role of the likable but naive, checker-playing Abner (who worked with Lum at the \"Jot 'Em down Store\" in fictitious Pine Ridge), Goff co-wrote the earliest episodes with Lauck, and played many of the other recurring characters, including postmaster Dick Huddleston (named after a real life friend in Mena), con-man Squire Skimp, Mousy Gray, and in the sentimental annual Christmas show, Doc Miller.\n\nGoff and Lauck also guest starred as Lum and Abner on radio series such as Bing Crosby's \"Kraft Music Hall\"; Goff also made a handful of solo appearances, notably guesting as the father of Andy Devine in an episode of \"The Jack Benny Program.\" Goff reprised his role as Abner for seven films between 1940 and 1956. Unlike Lauck, who virtually retired outside of playing Lum, Goff continued to make occasional guest appearances on television in the 1960s.

Sprang (July 28, 1915 – May 10, 2000) was an American comic book artist and penciller, best known for his work on the superhero Batman during the period fans and historians call Golden Age of Comic Books. Sprang was responsible for the 1950 redesign of the Batmobile and the original design of the Riddler, who has appeared in film, television and other media adaptations. Sprang's Batman was notable for his square chin, expressive face and barrel chest.\n\nSprang was also a notable explorer in Arizona, Utah, and Colorado, whose discoveries included \"Defiance House,\" a previously unrecorded ancestral Puebloan structure. Sprang's voluminous correspondence, journals, and thousands of photographs are archived at Northern Arizona Universities Cline Library Special Collections in Flagstaff, Arizona. A small amount of material is at the Utah Historical Society in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nDick Sprang was born in Fremont, Ohio, and became a professional illustrator at an early age, painting signs and handbills for local advertisers. According to comics historian Jerry Bails, Sprang worked throughout the 1930s for Standard Magazines, \"screening scripts\" as an editor, as well as contributing artwork to Standard, Columbia Publications and Street and Smith, while still in high school. He joined the staff of \"the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain in Toledo, Ohio\" shortly after graduating (circa 1934), continuing to produce magazine work concurrently. Sprang described his early career and work ethic, in 1987:\nHe left the newspaper in 1936 to move to New York City, where he began \"illustrating for the pulp magazines — the Western, detective, and adventure magazines in the era of the late 1930s\".\n\nFrom the late 1930s to the early 1940s, Sprang continued to work as a freelance illustrator, primarily for such pulp magazines as \"Popular Detective\", \"Popular Western\", \"Phantom Detective\", \"G-Men\", \"Detective Novels Magazine\", \"Crack Detective\" and \"Black Hood Detective\"/\"Hooded Detective\", for which last he also wrote some stories. Between 1937 and 1938, Sprang provided assistance on the King Features Syndicate comic strips \"Secret Agent X-9\" (layouts) and \"The Lone Ranger\" (pencil assists). In 1938, he also wrote briefly for the \"Lone Ranger\" radio series.\n\nLate in the decade, with the pulp magazines in decline, Sprang gravitated toward comic-book illustration. With Norman Fallon and Ed Kressey, he co-founded the studio Fallon-Sprang at \"a little studio loft on 42nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Grand Central\" Terminal and with a contact address of 230 West 101st Street in Manhattan. A promotional flier advertises the studio as comics packagers for such \"supermen\" features as \"Power Nelson\" (introduced in \"Prize Comics\" #1, March 1940) and \"Shock Gibson\"; \"human interest\" features such as \"Speed Martin\"; and the \"interplanetary\" feature \"Sky Wizard\" and detective feature \"K-7\" (both introduced in Hillman Periodicals' \"Miracle Comics\" #1, Feb. 1940, and attributed to Emile Schurmacher).\n\nContinuing to seek comic-book work, Sprang submitted art samples to DC Comics editor Whitney Ellsworth, who assigned him a \"Batman\" story in 1941. Anticipating that Batman creator Bob Kane would be drafted to serve in World War II, DC inventoried Sprang's work to safeguard against delays. Sprang's first published Batman work was the Batman and Robin figures on the cover of \"Batman\" #18 (Aug.-Sept. 1943), reproduced from the art for page 13 of the later-published \"Detective Comics\" #84 (Feb. 1944). Sprang's first original published Batman work, and first interior-story work, appeared in \"Batman\" #19 (Oct.-Nov. 1943), for which he penciled and inked the cover and the first three Batman stories, and penciled the fourth Batman story, inked by Norm Fallon. Like all Batman artists of the time, Sprang went uncredited as a ghost artist for Kane. In May of 1944, Sprang married commercial artist and photographer Lora Ann Neusiis in New York City. The couple moved west to Sedona, Arizona, in 1946. They were divorced in 1951 and Lora returned to New York City. \n\nSprang thereafter worked almost entirely on Batman comics and covers and on the Batman newspaper strip, becoming one of the primary Batman artists in the character's first 20 years. In 1955, Sprang got the chance to draw Superman, when he replaced Curt Swan as the primary artist for the Superman/Batman team-up stories in \"World's Finest Comics\", on which he worked until his retirement in 1963. Sprang also worked on a couple of stories for the main \"Superman\" comic, \"including the tale that introduced the first, prototype Supergirl\".\n\nSprang's work was first reprinted in 1961, and \"nearly all subsequent Batman collections have contained at least one of his efforts.\" However, his name never appeared on his Batman work during his career, due to stipulations in Bob Kane's contract. These stated that Kane's name would remain on the strip, regardless of whether he drew any particular story, and this restriction remained in place until the mid-1960s. It was subsequently revealed, however, that Sprang was Kane's favorite \"ghost\".\n\nComics historian Les Daniels wrote that Sprang's \"clean line and bold sense of design\" set him apart as \"the supreme stylist\" of the early Batman artists. Sprang used to study the way children read comics in order to experiment with page layouts and panel to panel transitions, hoping to create \"the most suspense and the most fluidity to keep the pages turning\". Daniels singles out Sprang's work on the 1948 debut of the Riddler as \"a superb example of story breakdown and page design\". The tardiness of Sprang's friend and frequent collaborator Bill Finger sometimes produced situations in which he would have to send in pencils for a story before the ending had been written, actions that \"required some careful figuring\". In \"Batman #34\", \"Sprang drew Batman and Robin capering across...Mount Rushmore\", over a decade before Alfred Hitchcock filmed a similar scene in North by Northwest. One story drawn by Sprang, \"Joker's Millions\", was adapted into an episode of \"\".\n\nDuring the time that Dick Sprang began illustrating Batman, he taught his wife — Lora A. Sprang — to letter, and she subsequently lettered most (and colored some) of his subsequent work under the pen name \"Pat Gordon\". In addition to lettering (and coloring) her husband's artwork, Lora Sprang also worked freelance as a photographer for \"Film Fun\" magazine, \"hand-lettered titles for industrial films,\" worked on the titles of Navy training films during World War II, and produced theatrical posters for 20th Century Fox.\n\nDuring the 1950s, \"Gordon\" continued to letter for DC on stories featuring \"Superman\", \"Batman\", \"Superboy\" and others, before leaving the company circa 1961.\n\nThe Sprangs moved to Sedona, Arizona in 1946, where he became interested in western pioneer trails. He spent much of his spare time between 1946 and 1963 surveying the northern Arizona and southern Utah area, especially Glen Canyon (before it was flooded). Sprang's first river trip in Glen was in 1950, and he and Lora divorced in 1951. Also in 1951, Dick made a two week river trip and a five week river trip, both in Glen Canyon. In 1952 on a six week Glen Canyon river trip along with Harry Aleson and Dudy Thomas, Sprang discovered the \"Defiance House\", an ancestral Puebloan structure believed to have been previously unseen by non-Natives. Dudy Thomas had explored the western United States extensively and accompanied Sprang and Aleson on multiple trips through Glen Canyon by raft in the early-mid 1950s. Thomas and Sprang were married in 1956. In 1956, he and Dudy moved to Torrey, Utah, and the next spring moved to nearby Fish Creek Ranch on where they ran cattle. Dudy passed away in January of 1958 and Sprang remarried that year to Elizabeth Lewis. In 1959, the two made a six week river run of Glen Canyon. They ran Glen one more time in 1961 before Glen was flooded by the reservoir named Lake Powell, created by Glen Canyon Dam. Sprang was also interested in photography and became a noted expert in the field of western pioneer trails; Sprang's voice can be heard on several National Park Service oral history tapes. \n\nIn 1963, Sprang retired from full-time comics illustrating. He and Elizabeth were divorced in 1972 and Sprang relocated from Utah to Prescott, Arizona that year. Sprang married Marion Lyday in 1973 and the two remained in Prescott until his death in 2000. Marion Sprang died in 2001.\n\nMostly unknown to comics readers during his career — uncredited on \"Batman\" and \"Superman\"; Sprang placed his name only on a handful of other stories that he drew, such as in \"Real Fact Comics\" — Sprang began to receive notice from comics fandom in the 1970s, when he became a regular attendee at comic conventions and later began drawing and selling reproductions of his Golden Age comics covers. During the 1980s (c. 1984–87) he devoted some of his time to recreating comic book material for the burgeoning collector's market, before returning to comics in 1987 for \"occasional assignments\". In 1990, he did the covers for \"Detective Comics\" #622–624. In 1995 and 1996, he produced two limited-edition lithographs depicting the Batcave (\"Secrets of the Batcave\") and the Batman cast of characters (\"Guardians of Gotham City\").\n\nInterior pencil work includes:\n\n\n\n\nSprang received an Inkpot Award at the San Diego ComiCon in 1992, and inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\n"}

Sometimes called \"the twin caves\" because they are within of each other, the two caves maintain a year-round temperature of 58 °F, contain more formations per foot than any other caves in Arkansas, and are open for public tours year-round except during the January flooding season.\n\nA third cave on the site, Not Much Sink cavern, has been deemed too dangerous to allow public tours.\n\nMystic Caverns, which has operated commercially since the late 1920s, is older than any other commercially operated cave in Arkansas, with the exception of Onyx Cave in Eureka Springs, and perhaps nearby Diamond Cave in Jasper, which has been toured since 1925. Crystal Dome was discovered in the mid-1960s during landscaping operations at Dogpatch USA. Great care was taken to preserve this pristine cave, and as a result 90% of it is still being formed. Tours began in the Crystal Dome in 1981.\n\nThe area was settled in the 1830s and named \"Wilcockson\". At that time the entrance to the as-yet-unnamed Mystic Caverns was a sinkhole which led to a drop into the cave itself. It is likely that settlers became aware of the cave and visited it prior to the 1850s. However, the first known visitor to the cave carved his name and the date on one of the formations:\n\"Adam Kolbe\"\n\"Wilcockson\"\n\"April 16, 1919\"\nThe cave was first given the name \"Mansion Cave\", date unknown, for its huge open chambers, and around 1928 the first commercial tours were offered to the public. Owned by Jim and Bob Gurley, who constructed a wooden ladder down into the sinkhole and leveled the floor for trails, the tours were guided by the use of kerosene lanterns for illumination. They renamed the cave \"Wild Horse Cavern\" and stationed a hand carved horse next to the ticket booth.\n\nIn 1930 the cave was purchased by a man named Singer who continued to operate it commercially, and issued each visitor a pair of coveralls and a kerosene lantern. Most of the soot damage to the cave was caused during this period. From 1937 to 1938 the cave was owned by Jerry Cannon and managed by Mose Arnold, who replaced the ladder with concrete steps and hung a rope next to the steps to aid visitors as they descended into the cave.\n\nIn 1938 commercial visitation to the cave was halted by an unidentified Arkansas state official; the dangerous condition of the steps and the probability of rock slides near the entrance to the cave were the likely reasons. From 1938 until 1949 the cave was unsupervised and frequently visited by the local residents. During this period the cave was damaged to a great extent by vandals who carried away pieces of the formations and sold them to commercial rock dealers.\n\nIn 1949 the cave was bought by Albert Raney Sr., who owned a nearby trout farm. The local highway was being paved for the first time, and Raney, who saw great potential for the cave as a tourist attraction, removed all the accumulated debris that had gathered over the years, created a safer spiral path down the sinkhole entrance to the cave and added steps where the path became too steep. He also added hand rails, leveled the trails and covered them with lime which hardened to provide better footing, installed the first electric lighting system inside the cave, and built a new ticket booth (which was eventually destroyed in a fire in 1984). The cave was renamed \"Mystic Caverns\" and reopened for public tours in 1950. In 1959 Albert Raney Sr. handed the responsibility of the enterprise to his son Albert Raney Jr. He would continue to manage the cave's operations with the help of his family and friends until 1984.\n\nIn 1966, the cave was purchased, along with the Raney's trout pond, by the developers of Dogpatch USA, a theme park based on Al Capp's Li'l Abner comic strip, and was intended to be incorporated into the park's attractions. Development of the area began around and within the cave. Jim Schermerhorn, an experienced caver, and original shareholder of Dogpatch, supervised the work.\n\nOriginally, the cave had some potentially dangerous problems. The first visitors had to hike up and down Mill Creek canyon to reach the entrance. Later, a rickety swinging bridge had been constructed over the canyon eliminating the exhausting hike, but creating a new danger. Also, the sinkhole entrance was still quite dangerous. Schermerhorn would have a safer road across the canyon built and a new man-made entrance to the cave constructed. Other improvements included a new parking lot, landscaping around the cave, and a new ticket office and gift shop. The trails within the cave were slightly altered and replaced with stone. Also, pipe welded hand rails, and a new indirect lighting system was added.\n\nDuring construction of the new parking lot, while Jim Schermerhorn was operating a bulldozer, a new sinkhole opened up leading to an enormous previously unknown cavern. The cave was named \"Old Man Moses Cave\" after a Li'l Abner cartoon character. Being an experienced caver, Schermerhorn realized the importance of preserving the pristine cave never before seen or touched by human hands. He camped out at the entrance of the cave until it could be blocked off from visitors.\n\nIn 1968, Mystic Caverns reopened under the name \"Dogpatch Caverns\". \"Old Man Moses Cave\" was supposed to open eventually as well as a part of Dogpatch, but like many planned projects of the park, it would never happen. In 1981, Dogpatch sold the caves and they continued to be managed by Bruce Raney, son of Albert Raney Jr. During this time, the Old Man Moses Cave project was completed. It has since been renamed Crystal Dome and opened to the public. Omni Projects bought the two caves in 1984 and hired Burt Allen to manage the property. In 1988, Steve Rush purchased the property and it was managed by Jennifer Updegraff, Steven Rush and Marcia Johnson. Mystic Caverns, Inc bought the property in 1997 and owns it currently.\n\nToday Mystic Caverns and Crystal Dome are managed by Steve Rush, and guided tours, which include both caves, are conducted every 35 to 45 minutes and last about an hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn late 2008, Rush put the caverns up for auction on eBay. The minimum bid was first set at $1.2 million, but later reduced to $899,900. Rush said he is selling the attraction because he has \"tired of trying to entertain people\" in his role as tour guide. Once a buyer is found for the caverns, Rush plans to become involved in Christian ministries.\n\nMystic Caverns averages about 15,000 visitors each year, Rush told an Associated Press reporter.\n"}

In 1833 he became a lieutenant in the guards of Queen Isabella II, and during the Carlist War from 1833 to 1840 he became general of division in the latter year at the early age of twenty-six. The Moderate party made him war minister in 1847 and sent him to Catalonia, where his efforts to put down a Carlist rising were not attended with success. He had been made a senator in 1845, and marquis in 1848.\n\nHe was sent out to Manila in 1852 as governor-general of the Philippine Islands. In April 1854 he crushed with much sternness a formidable insurrection and carried out many useful reforms. On his return to Spain he married the Countess of Santa Isabel, and commanded the reserves in the Peninsula during the war with Morocco. He refused the war portfolio twice offered him by Marshals O'Donnell and Narvaez and in 1864 was briefly president of government (prime minister) at the head of a cabinet of conservative-liberal Moderates; his government lasted but a few days.\n\nHe volunteered to crush the insurrection in Madrid on 22 June 1866, and when the revolution broke out in September 1868 accepted the command of Queen Isabella's troops. He was defeated by Marshal Serrano at the bridge of Alcolea on 28 September 1868, and was so badly wounded in the face that he was disfigured for life.\n\nHe kept apart during the revolution of 1868, but instead was instrumental in installing the conservative military dictatorship of 1873 that ended the First Republic. It was Pavía who, after 3 January 1874, summoned Marshal Serrano back from France as dictator to the military republic.\n\nAfter the coup of December 1874 restored the liberal monarchy, Pavía went to meet King Alfonso XII of Spain when he landed at Valencia in January 1875. The Restoration made the Marquis de Novaliches a senator, and the new king gave him the Golden Fleece. He died in Madrid on 22 October 1896.\n"}

The small linear leaves with pale undersides and down-rolled margins grow in whorls of four or five on the wiry stems. The inflorescence is a fat, leafy spike with a few long-stalked, globular flowers; these are pink or lilac and have brown stamens that protrude from the open mouths. The flowering period is from July to September.\n\nIn Great Britain it is only found on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall, where the unusual geology gives rise to the acid soils that it favours. It was voted the County flower of Cornwall in 2002 following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife. It is often considered the Cornish floral emblem. According to one story this is because when Joseph of Arimathea first arrived in Cornwall looking for tin he had nowhere to stay, so he spent his first night on a bed of Cornish heather. In thankfulness, he blessed the plant and it has been a blessed plant ever since.\n\nLike almost all plants in the heath family (Ericaceae), \"E. vagans\" requires an acidic or, at the very least, neutral soil to thrive. In areas with alkaline (basic) soil, this can be achieved by planting \"E. vagans\" in containers with ericaceous compost. Numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of flower colours in white, pink, mauve and purple.

Former members include multi-instrumentalist William Henshall (credited as Willy M); George Chandler (formerly a founding member and frontman of Olympic Runners); Marc Goldschmitz (subsequently a member of the band Leash) and Myles Kayne\n\nLondonbeat's career started in the Netherlands where \"There's a Beat Going On\" reached the Top 10, and then \"9 A.M (The Comfort Zone)\" which subsequently became a modest success in the United Kingdom. They are best known for their song \"I've Been Thinking About You\", which hit Number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in 1991, and for their close harmonies. Their follow-up single, \"A Better Love\", became a \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top 20 hit, and they returned to Number 1 on the dance chart with \"Come Back\" (Hot 100 number 62).\n\nA demo of \"I've Been Thinking About You\" surfaced on audio cassettes and circulated amongst record companies around the time Londonbeat released their début in 1988. \"I've Been Thinking About You\" was originally intended for release on \"Speak\". However, record labels advised the band to hold off releasing the song on their debut LP so that the band could, as labels said, \"...find its footing; develop an audience\". The demo recording, originally completed in late 1987, is currently circulating on the Internet, and originally brought to public attention in a link on a German message board in 2006. German magazines, however, reported on the song just as \"Speak\" was being released in 1988.\n\nIn 1995, Londonbeat entered the UK heats of the Eurovision Song Contest with \"I'm Just Your Puppet on a ...

However, they were not selected to enter the main contest (losing out to rap group Love City Groove) and the single stalled at Number 55 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn 2003, Londonbeat re-grouped with a new lineup and signed to German record label Coconut.

His middle name, 'McLaren', was a tribute to the family's landlord Mrs McLaren, who had helped his mother during his birth. His father, John Lambden Ross, was a ship merchant of Scottish blood, but born in Cuba, whose Scottish father traded in Cuba, the West Indies and the United States, and his mother, from an Anglo-Indian family of English blood, was described as 'a magnificent Indian lady and the obvious source of his male beauty'. Maclaren-Ross was largely educated in the South of France, though his memoir \"The Weeping and the Laughter\" (1953) principally concerns his boyhood in the Southbourne district of Bournemouth. In 1943 he was discharged from the army, having been found at home with a female acquaintance while AWOL.\n\nMaclaren-Ross was a frequent contributor to literary journals, such as \"The London Magazine\" and \"Horizon\". He was known to be a sympathiser of the Labour Party, and though he never dealt with explicitly political themes in his stories, the backdrop of inter- and post-war social strife was always intimated. Maclaren-Ross was fictionalised as novelist X. Trapnel in Anthony Powell's \"A Dance to the Music of Time\" and as Prince Yakimov in Olivia Manning's \"The Balkan Trilogy\" and was the subject of a 2003 biography \"Fear and Loathing in Fitzrovia\" by Paul Willetts. John Betjeman described him as 'one of our very best writers'.\n\nHis reputation as a dandy in post-war London Bohemia to some extent exceeds the actual stature of his recognised works. His turbulent life and pivotal role in the Fitzrovian milieu has ensured continued interest in his work. Debt, alcoholism and a love of debauched living all featured heavily in his life. His biographer referred to him as the 'mediocre caretaker of his own immense talent'.\n\nIn its review of the posthumously published \"Memoirs of the Forties\", \"The Times\" on 23 September 1965, opined that MacLaren-Ross's army stories and \"Of Love and Hunger\" were 'small classics' but said that his writing had gone downhill in the Fifties. However, the paper considered his memoirs a return to form, saying, 'He wrote with economy and a formal elegance that marvellously suited his detached attitude to whatever in his surroundings seemed odd, ridiculous or wild; down it all went in curt graphic dialogue and deadpan description. There is nothing else that so conveys the atmosphere of bohemian and fringe-literary London under the impact of war and its immediate hangover. The book is comic, nostalgic and at times even moving, all without the least sense of strain.'\n\nIn his \"Times\" obituary on 6 November 1964 the paper said MacLaren-Ross 'was a dedicated and highly professional writer who never quite found the right vein for his talents.' It added that his short stories:\n'took him into the wartime literary world, where he became a conspicuous figure in Soho and Fitzrovia, blossoming out after his demobilization as a tall, slightly theatrical-looking gentleman with a silver-knobbed stick. This appearance, and the formal manners that went with it, were somewhat misleading. His stories of Soho, though aimed at a less important target than their predecessors, were still ironic, often tightly compressed and usually very funny. At the same time he was starting to work as a script-writer in films, a subject which always passionately interested him. Then he turned his attention further back: first to his unhappy prewar period as a salesman, which became the subject of his one really serious novel \"Of Love and Hunger\" (1947) then to his childhood as son of a none too prosperous Scottish father, dividing his retirement between France and a melancholy-refined English seaside. \"The Weeping and the Laughter\", the first volume of this autobiography, appeared in 1953 and only took him up to the age of 11; unfortunately it was never followed by others, and from then on he was driven to do a great deal too much occasional work to fulfil his very real potentialities. Unfortunately for him perhaps, he was an admirable contributor of occasional articles and parodies to \"Punch\" and a valued reviewer for \"The Times Literary Supplement\", \"The Sunday Times\", and, more recently, \"The London Magazine\". He also did occasional film work and at least two thriller-serials for the Light Programme of the B.B.C. But in spite of his interest in, and encyclopaedic knowledge of, the thriller form in both novel and film his own incursions into the medium were never really successful, either in the artistic or in the commercial sense. His reviews made more demands on him; at least they showed his very wide literary knowledge and interests, which included much that was relentlessly highbrow in both French and English. It was only quite lately that his publisher managed to induce him to embark on \"Memoirs of the Forties\", of which an admirably promising instalment appeared in \"The London Magazine\" for November. It was about half finished at the time of his death. For his best and profoundest book was \"Of Love and Hunger\", which was recently republished as a paperback. It is a short, tragic work somewhat in the vein of Patrick Hamilton, but deserves to live in its own right. The army stories were collected in \"The Stuff to Give the Troops\" (1944): they are minor historic documents as well as very funny stories. Apart from the autobiography none of his seven other books comes up to this level, but anything he wrote has a certain distinction. His manuscripts were unforgettable, tiny neat writing with a slight slope and the odd baroque decoration, written perhaps in the Mandrake Club or in a pub. Ironic, self-controlled, slightly stilted, yet giving nothing away, they were very like the man himself.'\n\n\n\n"}

The duo's first Columbia album, \"Get Right with the Man\", produced a Top Ten country hit in \"Help Somebody.\"\n\nJohnny recorded as a member of the 1980s southern rock band The Johnny Van Zant Band which released albums in 1980, 1981 and 1982. The band shortened its name to Van Zant for the release of its fourth album in 1985, the eponymous \"Van Zant\" on Geffen Records. This album saw chart success with \"You've Got to Believe in Love\" and \"I'm a Fighter\", both of which peaked on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

This album accounted for their fourth charted rock single in \"Get What You Got Comin'.\"\n\nIn 2005, the duo crossed over into country music, releasing \"Get Right with the Man\" on Columbia Records. The album produced a Top 10 country single in \"Help Somebody\", followed by the No. 16 \"Nobody Gonna Tell Me What to Do\" and No. 59 \"Things I Miss the Most.\" The album also earned RIAA gold certification. The Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal in 2005 began with an investigation of an installation of the CD \"Get Right with the Man\".\n\nIt was not possible to import the CD into iTunes because of a glitch created by Sony's digital rights management software.

Upon completing that mission, the ship returned to Funafuti on 26 February, only to sail three days later for Majuro.\n\nWhile she was serving there, Service Squadron (ServRon) 4 was absorbed by ServRon 10. There, she and repaired combatant ships through the Hollandia strikes and during preparations for the Marianas campaign. On 13 June, she sailed for Eniwetok to help set up an advance repair base where she labored through August, at one time working extensive jobs on 19 cruisers and nine battleships.\n\nLate in August, bacillary dysentery broke out among the crew and soon reached epidemic proportions. The ship was quarantined on 1 September and detached on 9 September to proceed to Kwajalein to combat the epidemic. Quarantine ended on 10 October, and \"Ajax\" steamed to Ulithi to resume repair work and to handle her first major battle damage job. Severely damaged during a torpedo attack off Formosa, received sufficient temporary repairs alongside \"Ajax\" to enable the cruiser to continue on to Manus. The repair ship continued her work at Ulithi in support of operations in the Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.\n\nOn 25 May 1945, \"Ajax\" headed for San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, to help prepare for the final assault on Japan, spending July repairing typhoon-battered . The job consisted of rebuilding the forward section of her flight deck and required assistance from , , and .\n\nUpon learning of Japan's capitulation on 15 August, \"Ajax\" began readying amphibious and transport ships to carry occupation forces to the Japanese home islands. On 20 September, she sailed for Guiuan, Samar; embarked troops for passage to Okinawa; and once there, repaired other typhoon-damaged ships. Ironically, while she was carrying out this task, typhoons forced her to go to sea herself on 28 September and on 7 October. But for these two incidents, her work at Okinawa was uninterrupted until 28 November, when she sailed for the United States with 800 passengers. She arrived at San Diego on 18 December and, three days later, entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for a six-week overhaul.\n\nThe yard work ended on 23 February 1946, and \"Ajax\" sailed via Pearl Harbor for the Bikini Atoll to participate in the atomic bomb tests to be held there in July. The first bomb was dropped 8 miles away from the ship, the second only 6 miles away. The crew men were instructed to stand on the deck. It was reported that each man saw the skeleton of the man in front of him. Following the tests, she returned to San Diego on 8 October. For the next few years, she tended ships primarily at San Diego.\n\nThe repair ship got underway on 2 April 1951 for the first of many postwar cruises to Japan and arrived at Yokosuka on the 18th. She headed for Sasebo on 1 May and spent the rest of the year and early 1952 engaged in repair services in those two ports.\n\n\"Ajax\" returned to San Diego on 26 April and devoted the next four and one-half months to operations in various shipyards and ports along the coast of California. She made five more cruises to Japan before 1960, each time operating out of Sasebo and Yokosuka and in every instance returning to San Diego.\n\nWhile in Sasebo on November 30, 1952 the ship that the Ajax was moored next to, the USS Ashtabula ( AO -51) exploded! The resulting casualties for the Ajax were two dead and three wounded.[1]\n\nOn her 1953-1954 cruise to the Far East, \"Ajax\", in addition to her operations out of Sasebo and Yokosuka, participated in the two-month operation \"Passage to Freedom\", providing support for a group of U.S. Navy ships sent to carry refugees from the Hanoi/Haiphong area of Communist North Vietnam, down to Saigon. During this operation Ajax was stationed at Touraine Indochina, a French port that later became DaNang, South Vietnam.\n\nShe returned to San Diego on 21 November 1954, along with several attack transports.\n\n\"Ajax\" returned from the United States to Japan in February 1960 and in June received orders changing her home port from San Diego to Sasebo. She then became the permanent flagship of ServRon 3 in the Far East. She moved to Yokosuka in August to begin her first yard overhaul in the Orient. Among her alterations was the installation of flag office spaces for ServRon 3 staff. Following refresher training, underway replenishment, and towing exercises with , \"Ajax\" returned to Sasebo on 17 December.\n\nEarly in 1961, she became an ambassador of goodwill on a cruise in which she entertained local dignitaries as well as the local populace during visits to Kure, Beppu, Kagoshima, Iwakuni, and Kobe, Japan; Hong Kong; Keelung and Kaoshiung, Taiwan; Subic Bay; and Buckner Bay, Okinawa. A scheduled two-day visit to the last port became a three-week stay in March and April when \"Ajax\" remained there as backup repair ship in the event that President John F. Kennedy's strong diplomatic resistance to communist aggression in Laos would involve the American Navy in hostilities.\n\nWhen , the first nuclear submarine to put into a Japanese port, arrived at Sasebo on 12 November 1964, \"Ajax\" served as a press platform for radio and television reporters who came to report the event.\n\nOn 10 January 1968, \"Ajax\" sailed for Subic Bay where she remained until mid-March, before returning to her home port. On 3 June, the repair ship headed for South Vietnam and arrived at Vung Tau on 9 June. Although that port was a rest and recreation center for the allied forces, \"Ajax\" worked without break for 13 days making badly needed repairs and providing services to ships and small craft operating in the Mekong Delta, as well as to various Army and Air Force equipment ashore. The ship got underway for Subic Bay on 22 June, arrived on 25 June, and undertook a repair job of considerable significance—the regunning of 4 × mounts on . The repair ship's technicians worked around the clock for seven days to complete the job and return \"Boston\" to her ready status. After her arrival in Sasebo on 23 July, \"Ajax\" provided routine repairs and service support for ships there and in Yokosuka for the remainder of the year and the beginning of 1969.\n\n\"Ajax\" continued her usual routine of servicing ships in Sasebo, Yokosuka, and Subic Bay during 1969, including a two-week stay in Vung Tau from 27 September to 10 October. As 1970 began, she received word that her home port would revert to San Diego effective 1 June. Prior to that date, \"Ajax\" continued servicing Vung Tau from 18 April to 11 May in support of the Cambodian Campaign. relieved \"Ajax\" as flagship on 10 July; and, on the 15th, the latter headed for San Diego where she arrived on 6 August.\n\nOn 14 June 1971, following a year's service on the California coast, the ship once again steamed toward Japan and arrived in Sasebo on 5 July. Commander, Service Group (ComServGru) 3, embarked; and \"Ajax\" commenced business as usual. The ship spent September in Vung Tau, but her month of hard work there was followed by five days of rest and relaxation in Hong Kong before she returned to Sasebo on 1 October. However, the vessel soon again proceeded to Vung Tau and worked diligently for the first three weeks in November. Next came a three-day rest in Keelung and Taipei, Taiwan, before a run back to Sasebo to prepare for the voyage home. On 27 January 1972, ComServGru 3 shifted his flag to \"Hector\"; and \"Ajax\" steamed via Pearl Harbor to San Diego where she arrived on 16 February and served for the remainder of the year.\n\n\"Ajax\" again got underway westward on 16 January 1973 and stopped at Pearl Harbor before arriving in Sasebo on 6 February to relieve \"Jason\" as flagship. The ship made two rest and relaxation cruises, one in April to Keelung and the other in July to Hong Kong. Typhoon Dot complicated the second cruise by closing Hong Kong harbor and causing \"Ajax\" to circle in rough waters for two extra days before pulling into port. Her return to Sasebo on 25 July was uneventful; and, after being relieved by \"Hector\" on 7 August, the ship headed home, arrived at San Diego on 29 August, and remained in California for the rest of the year and the first six months of 1974. On 6 July of that year, she got underway in company with and steamed for Yokosuka which she reached on 27 July. She operated there until 8 November when she headed for Subic Bay to provide fleet repair services. She labored in the Philippines for a month before proceeding to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, where she ended the year.\n\n\"Ajax\" returned to San Diego on 15 February 1975. On 5 October, she got underway for a two-month visit to Pearl Harbor to provide repair support in the middle Pacific. She departed Hawaii on 8 December and arrived in her home port on the 15th in time for a holiday in a leave and upkeep period. \"Ajax\" remained in or near San Diego for the entire year 1976.\n\nDuring the first half of 1977, \"Ajax\" made ready for another deployment. The ship departed San Diego with on 24 August and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 31 August. The following morning, \"Ajax\" got underway for Japan and six months in Yokosuka. A series of labor strikes by Japanese employees gave the repair ship's crew members the opportunity to prove their expertise and capabilities. Besides carrying out their normal duties, they helped run the base utilities and acted as firemen, bus drivers, and skilled practitioners of many other occupations to aid the naval activity. She visited Taipei, Taiwan, in December and spent four days in January 1978 in Pusan, Korea. On 5 February, she headed via Pearl Harbor for San Diego, where she arrived on 24 February.\n\nExcept for two days of sea trials in April, \"Ajax\" remained at San Diego until mid-1980. During this period she received an overhaul there by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company which lasted from 21 September 1978 to 21 July 1979.\n\nOn 20 May, she sailed for the Orient and reached Subic Bay on 17 June. Three days later, the ship got underway and steamed via Sri Lanka to Diego Garcia where she arrived and relieved on 6 July. During her busy three months in the Indian Ocean servicing 31 ships, \"Ajax\" made a brief visit to Port Louis, Mauritius, for recreation. On 12 October, after being relieved by , \"Ajax\" sailed eastward; stopped in Bunbury and Sydney, Australia; Pearl Harbor; and finally reached San Diego on 20 November.\n\nWith the exception of two three-day visits to San Francisco and two days of training in the local operating area, \"Ajax\" remained in San Diego throughout 1981. One notable occurrence during the year was the reporting on board for duty of the ship's first 30 enlisted women. While the women became accustomed to shipboard routine, \"Ajax\" underwent inspections and training. On 16 October, the ship reached another milestone in the Women at Sea program when Ens. Dale Norris became the first woman officer on board \"Ajax\" to become surface warfare qualified.\n\nOn 22 January 1982, \"Ajax\" got underway for training and a brief port visit to Mazatlan, Mexico, and arrived back home on the last day of the month. Pre-overseas movement preparations throughout the next few months ensured that the repair ship was ready for her 2 April departure for the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. After a four-day stopover in Pearl Harbor, the ship headed for Subic Bay, where she arrived on 1 May and spent three weeks providing fleet repair services before continuing on to Diego Garcia where she arrived on 1 June. During that deployment, \"Ajax\" visited Berbera in Somalia, Singapore, and Pattaya in Thailand, before she returned—via Pearl Harbor—to San Diego. The repair ship entered San Diego on 21 October and commenced post-deployment standdown.\n\nHer leave and upkeep period came to an end in November, and \"Ajax\" set about her repair work once again. Over the next seven months, the ship provided repair services for units of the Pacific Fleet at San Diego, served as a training facility for naval reserve detachments undergoing their annual two weeks of active duty, and made preparations for a regular overhaul. She also put to sea infrequently for trials and, on one occasion in May and June 1983, to carry her repair services to Bremerton, Wash. \"Ajax\" returned to San Diego from that mission on 10 June 1983 and, the next day, began a month of final preparations for overhaul. On 11 July, her crew moved to living spaces on board a non-self-propelled barracks ship, and the overhaul began in earnest.\n\nReceiving repair services, rather than extending them to others, occupied her time for the rest of 1983 and during the first two months of 1984. On 1 and 2 March, she put to sea to conduct post-overhaul trials and, on the 3d, resumed repair services to other units of the Pacific Fleet. During the last week in March, she was frequently at sea in the local operating area carrying out independent ship's exercises. From the beginning of April to late June, \"Ajax\" performed repair missions at San Diego. On 27 June, the repair ship stood out of San Diego and, after a day of independent ship's exercises in the local operating area, shaped a course for the Naval Air Station, Alameda, where she moored on 29 June. \"Ajax\" carried out repair assignments at Alameda until the third week in September. On 16 September, she got underway to conduct exercises and then head back to San Diego. The repair ship tied up at pierside at the Naval Station, San Diego, on 19 September. Except for two periods at sea in October for refresher training, \"Ajax\" spent the rest of 1984 in port repairing ships of the Pacific Fleet.\n\nShe continued so engaged into January 1985, though she interrupted those efforts from the 19th to the 21st to carry out sea trials in the southern California operating area. The first three weeks of February brought more repair work; however, on the 22nd, she put to sea again bound for Long Beach. \"Ajax\" reached her destination on 27 February and set about her work almost immediately. She spent the next five months—save for five days underway locally in May—performing repairs at Long Beach. On 31 July, the repair ship embarked upon the final overseas assignment of her Navy career.\n\nHer last deployment afforded \"Ajax\" a real opportunity to carry out the function for which she had been designed and built. Continually moving, she performed repairs at widely separated locations. Steaming by way of Hawaii and Guam, she arrived in the Philippines at Subic Bay on 31 August. From Subic Bay, she voyaged to Singapore where she stopped between 24 September and 3 October. Leaving Singapore, \"Ajax\" headed through the Malacca Strait into the Indian Ocean. She arrived at isolated Diego Garcia Island on 11 October but resumed her voyage again on the 13th. The repair ship dropped anchor at Al Masirah, an island in the Arabian Sea just off the east coast of Oman, on the 19th and carried out repair work there until the beginning of November. On the 2d, she headed back to Diego Garcia where she arrived on the 9th. Her crew performed repairs on and before \"Ajax\" put to sea to return to Al Masirah. After conducting availabilities for ships of the Middle East Force at Al Masirah from 22 November to 5 December, she put to sea to avoid a large dust storm. While still underway, she laid in a course for Singapore on 7 December. The ship reached her destination on 20 December. Following repairs on , \"Ajax\" set sail once again on 31 December bound for Diego Garcia Island. She arrived at Diego Garcia on 7 January 1986 and provided repair services there for a fortnight. On 22 January, the ship left Diego Garcia in her wake and set course for Pattaya, Thailand, where she spent most of the first week in February. On 12 February, \"Ajax\" stood into Subic Bay where she was relieved by \"Hector\".\n\nThe repair ship embarked upon the long voyage across the Pacific Ocean on 21 February. She stopped at Pearl Harbor between 8 and 10 March and arrived back in San Diego on the 18th. Following the usual leave and upkeep period, \"Ajax\" resumed her repair services. That activity lasted until the second week in September when she began preparations to go out of service. \"Ajax\" was decommissioned at San Diego on 31 December 1986.\n\nStruck from the Navy list on 16 May 1989, \"Ajax\" was finally sold for scrapping by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service on 23 May 1997.\n\nAwards, Citations and Campaign Ribbons\n \nThe above list is incomplete. \nUSS Ajax was awarded the following Awards in order of precedence: \nTop Row - Navy Unit Commendation - Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation - Navy Battle \"E\" Ribbon\nSecond Row - Navy Expeditionary Medal (Iran/Indian Ocean) - American Campaign Medal - Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal\nThird Row - World War II Victory Medal - Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp) - National Defense Service Medal (2)\nFourth Row - Korean Service Medal (4) - Vietnam Service Medal (5) - Philippines Liberation Medal\nFifth Row - United Nations Service Medal - Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal - Republic of Korea War Service Medal (retroactive)\n\n1.

She has won four American Music Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and a Grammy Award nomination with the group.\n\nUpon C+C Music Factory's emergence onto the scene in late 1990, Davis was marketed as the principal vocalist of the ensemble—despite there having been several other female vocalists, in addition to her, who had provided the vocals to various tracks on the group's debut album, \"Gonna Make You Sweat\". Davis appeared in the music video for the album's number-one Hot 100-charting title track, where she lip-synched to vocals which had, in fact, been sung by Martha Wash.\n\nWash (who had also provided vocals to Black Box during the same period, and also saw that group use models to lip-sync to her voice in the music videos) did not appreciate the perception of Davis being the voice behind the hit song, and proceeded to file a lawsuit against the group. With this happening during the height of the Milli Vanilli lip-synching scandal, Davis found herself being accused of being a \"no talent\" who was being featured by the group only because of her looks — despite her having actually performed a number of songs on their studio album \"Gonna Make You Sweat\".\n\nIn 1992, she made an appearance on the American sitcom \"Blossom\".

It is dedicated to \"Our Lady of Kazan\", one of the most venerated icons in Russia.\n\nConstruction of the cathedral started in 1801 and continued for ten years under the supervision of Alexander Sergeyevich Stroganov. Upon its completion in 1811, the new temple replaced the Church of Nativity of the Theotokos, which was disassembled when the Kazan Cathedral was consecrated.\n\nThe architect Andrey Voronikhin modelled the building on St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Some art historians assert that Emperor Paul (reigned 1796-1801) intended to build a similar church on the other side of Nevsky Prospect that would mirror the Kazan Cathedral, but such plans failed to materialize. Although the Russian Orthodox Church strongly disapproved of the plans to create a replica of a Catholic basilica in Russia's then capital, several courtiers supported Voronikhin's Empire Style design.\n\nAfter Napoleon invaded Russia (1812) and the commander-in-chief General Mikhail Kutuzov asked \"Our Lady of Kazan\" for help, the church's purpose altered. The Patriotic War over, Russians saw the cathedral primarily as a memorial to their victory over Napoleon. Kutuzov himself was interred in the cathedral in 1813; and Alexander Pushkin wrote celebrated lines meditating over his sepulchre. In 1815 keys to seventeen cities and eight fortresses were brought by the victorious Russian army from Europe and placed in the cathedral's sacristy. In 1837, Boris Orlovsky designed two bronze statues of Kutuzov and of Barclay de Tolly which stand in front of the cathedral.\n\nIn 1876 the Kazan demonstration, the first political demonstration in Russia, took place in front of the church. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 the authorities closed the cathedral (January 1932). In November 1932 it reopened as the pro-Marxist \"Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism\". or, as one contemporary writer put it more baldly, \"Leningrad's largest antireligious museum\", complete with Spanish Inquisition waxworks . Services resumed in 1992, and four years later the cathedral was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. it functions as the mother cathedral of the metropolis of St. Petersburg.\nThe cathedral's interior, with its numerous columns, echoes the exterior colonnade and is reminiscent of a palatial hall, being 69 metres in length and 62 metres in height. The interior features numerous sculptures and icons created by the best Russian artists of the day. A wrought-iron grille separating the cathedral from a small square behind it is sometimes cited as one of the finest ever constructed.\n\nThe cathedral's huge bronze doors are one of four copies of the original doors of the Baptistery in Florence, Italy (the other three are at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, United States, at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, United States, and at the Florence Baptistery itself).\n\nThe Kazan Cathedral is considered to be the model for the neoclassical style of Helsinki Cathedral, one of the most iconic landmarks of Helsinki, Finland.\n\n"}

Additionally, the rhyme of \"-don dwelling\" with \"a colonelling\" is strained to the point of breaking, again for humorous effect. Further, the rhyme scheme in a Hudibrastic will imply inappropriate comparisons.

The temple is now mostly in ruins, and a collection of its sculptures is housed in the Sun Temple Museum, which is run by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nKonark is also home to an annual dance festival called Konark Dance Festival, devoted to classical Indian dance forms, including the traditional classical dance of Odisha, Odissi.

Some of the wheels are 3 meters wide. Only six of the seven horse still stand today. The temple fell into disuse after an envoy of Jahangir desecrated the temple in the early 17th century.\n\nAccording to folklore, there was a diamond in the centre of the idol which reflected the sun rays that passed. In 1627, the then Raja of Khurda took the Sun idol from Konark to the Jagannath temple in Puri. The Sun temple belongs to the Kalingan school of Indian temple architecture. The alignment of the Sun Temple is along the east–west direction. The inner sanctum or \"vimana\" used to be surmounted by a tower or \"shikara\" but it was razed in the 19th century.

{"id": "2180706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180706", "title": "History of the British farthing", "text": "History of the British farthing\n\nThe British farthing (derived from the Old English feorthing, a fourth part) was a British coin worth a quarter of an old penny ( of a pound sterling). It ceased to be struck after 1956 and was demonetised from 1 January 1961.\n\nThe British farthing is a continuation of the English farthing, struck by English monarchs prior to the Act of Union 1707, which unified the crowns of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain. Only pattern farthings were struck under Queen Anne as there was a glut of farthings from previous reigns. The coin was struck intermittently under George I and George II, but by the reign of George III, counterfeits were so prevalent the Royal Mint ceased striking copper coinage after 1775. The next farthings were the first struck by steam power, in 1799 by Matthew Boulton at his Soho Mint under licence. Boulton coined more in 1806, and the Royal Mint resumed production in 1821. The farthing was struck fairly regularly under George IV and William IV. By then it carried a scaled-down version of the penny's design, and would continue to mirror the penny and halfpenny until after 1936.\n\nFarthings were struck in most years of Queen Victoria's long reign. The coin continued to be issued in most years of the first half of the 20th century, and in 1937 it finally received its own reverse design, a wren. By the time the coin bore the portrait of Elizabeth II in 1953–1956, inflation had eroded its value. A fall in commercial demand also contributed to its demise.\n\nThe British farthing is a continuation of the farthing series begun in silver under the English king Henry III in the 13th century and first struck in copper in the early 17th century under James I of England. Britannia first appeared on the coin in 1672, under Charles II. Issuance of farthings had not been necessary during most of the reign of Queen Anne (1701–1714) due to a surplus of English farthings, which continued in circulation. But beginning in 1713, there was a shortage of copper coin (the halfpenny and farthing). The Royal Mint planned to issue farthings in 1714, but this was thwarted by the death of the Queen that year. The 1714 farthing, weighing 4.8–5.8 grams and of 21–22 millimetres diameter, is deemed a pattern. It contained about a farthing's worth of copper, as Sir Isaac Newton was Master of the Mint, and he believed coins should contain their value in metal. Some Anne farthings escaped into circulation, and there was a persistent and incorrect legend that they were of immensely high value. Britannia is said to bear the likeness of Queen Anne, and according to the numismatic writer Kerry Rodgers, \"it was at this point that the blending of the female personification of Britain with the image of the reigning Queen takes firm hold.\" Newton had strong views about the quality of the coinage, and the Anne farthing displays advances, such as greater consistency in striking, over that of William III.\n\nThe need for a copper coinage was no less after the accession of King George I (1714–1727), but the Anne halfpennies and farthings (made with metal prepared at the Royal Mint) had failed tests for purity, and it was not until 1717 that Newton tried to coin those two denominations again, this time from copper strip purchased from a contractor. The price of metal had risen, so the new farthings were lighter than the Anne coins, at 4.5–5.3 grams. The farthings struck in 1717 were smaller and thicker than the 1714 coins, with a diameter of 20–21 millimetres, and they are known as \"dump\" farthings. Farthings of 1719–1724 are slightly larger, at 22–23 millimetres, but are of the same weight. The coins were in high relief, and the Royal Mint had trouble transferring the design to the blanks, resulting in myriad flaws. The coin features the right-facing head of King George and the inscription on the obverse, and for the reverse a design identical to that of the Anne farthings: Britannia with the inscription and the date in the exergue below. Farthings were for sale at the Mint's premises at the Tower of London in packets of five and ten shillings; the Treasury refused to allocate funds for provincial distribution. The farthing's designs were by John Croker, possibly assisted by Johann Rudolph Ochs Sr, and were struck in every year from 1717–1724. The Mint had contracted for strip for seven years; when the contract ended, the coinage stopped.\nGeorge I died in 1727, the same year as Newton, and the king's son King George II succeeded to the throne, reigning until 1760. Croker engraved the new King's head for the coinage; the Britannia design was not changed. Farthings with Croker's design for George's head were minted in 1730–1737 and 1739. A bust showing an older King by John Sigismund Tanner was used on the farthing in 1741, 1744, 1746, 1749, 1750, and 1754, though the 1754 coin was probably minted at least until 1763. All George II farthings weighed 4.5–5.3 grams and had a diameter of 22–23 millimetres. Both obverses showed left-facing heads of King George and the inscription , and on the reverse, Britannia with the inscription and the date in the exergue. The farthing was made in relatively small number compared to the halfpenny (struck every year from 1730–1754); in no year were even half as many farthings coined, and in most years, far fewer.\n\nThe 1754 stoppage was due to a glut of coppers, and was done at the urgent request of merchants. Even then, a different problem—counterfeiting—had emerged. Lightweight counterfeit halfpennies and farthings (the penny was then made of silver) had been seen as early as 1725, and in the following decades, they became a flood. The laws at the time made counterfeiting copper coin merely a misdemeanour, punishable by a fine or a short term in gaol, while counterfeiting of gold and silver was dealt with severely. The counterfeits were especially prevalent in rural areas where regal issues, with no organised plan of distribution, were rarely seen. No farthings were coined after 1754, with the exception of 1754-dated later issues which may have been due to the Royal Mint using up stocks of copper. To make the counterfeiting uneconomical, in 1755 the Mint Board proposed reducing the value of the farthing to pence and the halfpenny to , but the Government refused.\n\nThe first halfpennies and farthings with the head of George II's grandson and successor, King George III (1760–1820), were issued in 1771, the year Parliament made it a felony to counterfeit copper coin. This had little effect; large quantities were melted down for lightweight imitations, though the farthing was less counterfeited than the halfpenny. This first series of George III farthings, struck in 1771 and 1773–1775, had a weight of 4.3–5.3 grams, with diameter 23–24 millimetres. The obverse, designed by Richard Yeo or Thomas Pingo depicts a right-facing bust of the king, with the inscription , while no significant change was made to the reverse. Despite the counterfeiting, the Mint ceased striking coppers in 1775 on the ground that there were sufficient legal farthings and halfpennies in commerce. The farthing would not be struck again by the Royal Mint until 1821.\n\nFrom 1775, most copper coins in circulation were counterfeit. The private sector eventually reacted, filling the gap with private tokens starting in 1787, and the Treasury awarded a contract to Matthew Boulton to strike copper coins in 1797. At his Soho Mint near Birmingham, Boulton produced the well-known Cartwheel pennies and twopences, so named for their appearance, the first official British coins struck by steam. The contract did not include producing farthings, though Boulton prepared several patterns. In 1799, Boulton was given a licence to produce halfpennies and farthings. In the meantime the price of copper had risen, and a more conventional coin was struck.\n\nThe 1799 farthing broke new ground in two areas: the reverse was inscribed , the first time the name of a denomination had ever appeared on an English or British coin, and it was also the first British coin to have the date on the same side as the monarch's head. The inscription on the obverse became , and the reverse depicts a redesigned left-facing seated Britannia holding a spray and spear, with the inscription . In 1806–1807 a further 22.5 tons of copper was struck into farthings by Boulton, but the price of copper had risen again and the weight was less than the 1799 issue. Farthings of the 1799 issue weigh 5.8–6.6 grams, with a diameter 23–24 millimetres, while the later Boulton issue weighs 4.7–4.8 grams with a diameter 21–22 millimetres. For the 1806–1807 issues, the denomination was removed from the coin, was abbreviated as , and the image of Britannia was slightly modified. Copper farthings and halfpennies from before 1797 were called in by proclamation dated 5 December 1817, and were redeemed by weight.\nThe currency was reformed in the 1810s with the Great Recoinage of 1816. The production of copper coins did not resume until after George III's death in 1820 and the accession of King George IV (1820–1830). Farthings were produced in 1821, Britannia maintaining her place on the reverse. These pieces were made current by a proclamation of 14 November of that year, that made them legal tender to sixpence. The original coinage portrait of the King, by Benedetto Pistrucci, attracted strong royal dislike, but was used on the farthing in 1821 and in 1823–26. By then, Pistrucci had been barred from work on the coinage for refusing to copy the work of another artist. William Wyon was given the task of engraving what became the more flattering \"bare head\" type of 1826. The issue of coppers in 1826 was because of the withdrawal of separate issues for Ireland; the Irish penny had been valued at of its British equivalent. The reverse was redesigned slightly, but remained more or less the same. The Pistrucci-designed farthings weighed 4.5–4.8 grams, with a diameter of 22 millimetres; the later ones by Wyon (issued each year from 1826–1830) weighed 4.6–4.9 grams with a diameter of 22 millimetres. Both Pistrucci's and Wyon's designs were produced in 1826. The Pistrucci obverse shows a left-facing bust of King George IV with the inscription , while the reverse shows a right-facing helmeted Britannia seated to the left of the coin, holding a shield and trident, with the inscription and the date in the exergue under Britannia. The Wyon obverse shows a laureate bust of King George IV, facing left, with the inscription , while the reverse inscription is unchanged.\n\nThe death of King George in 1830 brought his brother, King William IV (1830–1837) to the throne. Wyon, by then Chief Engraver, left the reverse of the farthing unchanged, and for the obverse engraved a portrait of King William by Sir Francis Chantrey. The inscriptions were unchanged, except that (William IV) was substituted for on the obverse. The farthing was produced in 1831, and 1834–1837, the final issue being struck during the year of King William's death.\n\nFarthings bearing the portrait of Queen Victoria, by Wyon, were struck beginning in 1838; no change was made to the reverse other than substituting the abbreviation (Regina, or Queen) for (King), indicating there was now a reigning Queen. The farthing remained the same size it had been since 1826. From 1838, the farthing was struck every year of Victoria's long reign except 1870, 1871 and 1889 (the 1877 issue was only in proof and may have been made at a later date). The same obverse dies were used for the copper farthing and the sovereign and most likely were used for the gold coin first. This contributed to a high level of defects in the farthing series, but ensured that they were struck every year, as was the popular gold coin. In Victorian times, a farthing could buy three oysters, with bread and butter, from an oyster-seller walking the streets of London. The coin would be enough to purchase a sparrow at a market in London's East End.\n\nIn 1859, the Government decided the poor state of the copper coinage demanded its withdrawal. Bronze was deemed a suitable replacement. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed the penny, halfpenny and farthing to be struck from an alloy of metals. Large quantity of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings were struck beginning in 1860 not only by the Royal Mint but by two Birmingham firms under contract. Although the weight of the penny was halved, the farthing was lightened by a bit less than that lest it be too small. The farthing was virtually identical to the penny and halfpenny but for minor details. The new bronze coinage went into circulation in December 1860; the old copper pieces were demonetised after 31 December 1869 in Britain (though the Mint would still accept them until 1873) and at the end of 1877 for the colonies.\nThe new bronze farthings weighed 2.8–3.0 grams, were 20 millimetres in diameter, and were made of an alloy of 95% copper, 4% tin and 1% zinc. Disregarding minor changes in alloy, these would remain the farthing's specifications until abolition after 1956. They read on the reverse, with the date in the exergue beneath Britannia. The obverse features the \"Bun head\" or \"Young head\" of Victoria; both sides of the coin were designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, William's son. The inscription on the obverse was . An \"H\" mintmark underneath the date can be seen on some 1874–1876 and 1881–1882 farthings; they were struck at the Heaton Mint in Birmingham. Although the Bun farthing series produced several varieties, they are not as extensive as for the penny and halfpenny. The farthing tended to have the lowest mintages of the three bronze coins, between 1 and 6 million being struck in most years in the late Victorian era; more halfpennies were struck than farthings, and mintages of the penny were regularly exceeding 10 million by the 1890s. Although fewer farthings were struck, a larger percentage has survived due to the sentimental attachment of the British people to the coin lowest in denomination.\n\nIn 1896, a new obverse was introduced to the bronze coinage showing Victoria as an elderly woman. The obverse was designed by Thomas Brock and engraved by George William de Saulles. The farthing continued to display it until the year of the Queen's death, 1901. De Saulles also revised the reverse; the most significant change was the deletion of the lighthouse and ship on either side of Britannia; they would never return to the farthing. The inscription on the Old Head farthing was . Beginning in 1897, farthings were issued artificially darkened; this was to avoid confusion of bright new farthings with the half sovereign; the bronze farthing and the gold piece were the same size.\n\nThe farthing of King Edward VII (1901–1910), Victoria's son and successor, was struck in every year from 1902–1910; it was still artificially darkened. Mintages ranged from 2.6 million (1910) to 8.9 million (1908) at a time when the penny's mintage never dropped below 12 million and rose to 47 million in 1907. A total of £1,021,013 in pennies were struck bearing Edward's portrait, and £222,790 in halfpennies, but only £45,429 in farthings. But for the statement of the coin's value, the designs on the penny, halfpenny and farthing are effectively identical as De Saulles used a Janvier reducing lathe to convert models to dies. The new obverse was his work, showing the king's right-facing bust, with the inscription .\n\nThe farthings of Edward's son and successor, King George V, resulted in a new left-facing portrait by Sir Bertram Mackennal and the continuation of the Britannia design. Farthings bearing King George's portrait were produced every year of his reign but 1910 and 1936. Other than substituting (George V) for , no change was made to the inscription. In 1917, the Mint ceased to darken farthings as the half sovereign was no longer being minted. In common with the penny and halfpenny, the King's head was made slightly smaller in 1926. The depiction of Britannia was also slightly adjusted in that year. A total of £5,710,748 in pennies, £1,039,704 in halfpennies and £222,643 in farthings were struck for the reign.\n\nThe Edward VIII farthing is a pattern which was awaiting royal approval at the time of the abdication in December 1936. There was a movement afoot for more modern coinage designs; the Irish Free State had in 1927 adopted a series of coins depicting animals and some of the colonies had redesigned their coinages. King Edward was also interested in a move away from the heraldry that marked British coinage, showing foreign coins on his watch chain to the Deputy Master of the Mint, Robert Johnson, and asking for more like those. King Edward eventually gave in on the question, fearing that such designs would be unacceptable to the British people, but non-heraldic themes for the halfpenny (a sailing ship) and farthing survived. The selected design for the farthing, a wren, placed the smallest British bird on the British coin smallest in value. In an attempt to break the deadlock between King and Mint, artist Wilson Parker had prepared a series of coinage designs based on what were loosely deemed royal animals: eagle, dove, stag, sturgeon, swan and wren, which though liked by the Advisory Committee (including a young Kenneth Clark) did not receive their endorsement due to their preference for heraldry. Another reason for the change was that the Britannia design, reduced from a model, was difficult to appreciate given the coin's small size. The obverse was designed by Humphrey Paget. King Edward got his way on one matter; his portrait faced left on the patterns, whereas by tradition a monarch faces in the opposite direction from the last reign, and George V had faced left. Edward insisted as he considered his left profile his better side. The only change to the inscription was the substitution of (Edward VIII) for .\nThe wren design was approved for the coinage of Edward's brother and successor, King George VI (1936–1952); it would stay on the coin for its remaining twenty years. Paget redesigned his obverse to include the new king's left-facing bust, and the wording was adjusted to include . The coin was struck each year from 1937. In 1949, following the independence of India, was removed from the obverse. The accession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 brought a new portrait to the farthing the following year, designed by Mary Gillick. The obverse inscription was in 1953, and thereafter. This change was a recognition that some of the nations of the British Commonwealth were republics.\n\nIn the years after the Second World War, the farthing had seen more use, as the standard one-pound (454 g) bread loaf had its price set by government, and the price included an odd halfpenny; thus a cash transaction for the purchase of a half-pound loaf by itself required a farthing, either with the payment or change. By the 1950s, due to inflation, the purchasing power of the farthing had dropped, as had commercial demand. Letters to \"The Times\" reflected this reality: one correspondent reported being refused when offering eight farthings to a bus conductor for a twopenny fare, and a vendor becoming abusive when offered six farthings for a newspaper. This occurred even though, as a later letter noted, the coin was still legal tender to a shilling. Demand continued to dwindle, and production of the farthing was discontinued after 1956. Eliminating the farthing from commerce also made way for a possible smaller penny and halfpenny that Royal Mint officials contemplated proposing. The farthing ceased to be legal tender after 31 December 1960.\n\n\n\n"}

Remaining population in overwhelmingly Hindu.\n\nZaidpur was a Musalman military colony founded in 462 Hijri (1070 AD) by Abdullah Zar-baqsh, an immigrant from Qom, Persia. The settlement was named for Zar-Baksh's only son, Zaid (b. 462 Hijri (1070 AD)).\n\nZar-baqsh was a descendant of the prophet Muhammad through his daughter, Fatimah and her husband, Ali, and thus was of the Rizvi family, in the 14th generation from Muhammad. Zar-baqsh's father was Yaqoob and his grandfather was Ahmad (924–969 AD), a naqib (official investigator) of Qom.\n\nThe list below describes the descendants of Muhammad to Zaid, after whom Zaidpur was named.\n\n\nZar-baqsh was born and raised in Qom. He later moved to Jajarm, now in current day North Khurasan, Iran. He was a scholar and a spiritual figure with miracles attributed to him. For example, under his spiritual power, gold fell from the sky, leading to his name \"Zar-baqsh\", the \"one who gives gold\". Due to persecution of the Saiyeds, (descendants of Muhammad), Zar-baqsh went to Lahore, Hindustan and from there, he travelled east, reaching a place in a forest, with a well, where he founded Zaidpur. This location was from the fort of Dawood Ghazi of Satrikh, an earlier immigrant, regional Muslim ruler, and a general of the sultan, Mahmood Ghaznavi.\n\nZar-baqsh married Bibi Yadgaar Bano, daughter of Dawood Ghazi. Dawood Ghazi's \"Mazaar\" (mausoleum), the \"Budhe Baba Ki Mazaar\" is in Satrikh, Barabanki district. Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud (1015–1032CE), the son of Dawood Ghazi and Sitr-e-Mu’alla (the sister of the Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi ), is entombed in Bahraich. Zar-basqh retired to a quiet spiritual life at the Dada Abdullah Ka Talaab well (known locally as the \"Dada Dullan Ka Talab\"). Later, a nearby village was founded and named Abdallahpur after Zar-baqsh.\n\nIn 1089CE, Zar-baqsh set out on a three-year-long, holy pilgrimage to Mecca. In 493 Hijri (1099CE), he left again. In 493 Hijri (1100CE), in Jajarm, in North Khorasan Province, Iran. Zar-baqsh died of an illness and is buried there.\n\nZaid, the son of Zar-baqsh, was a saintly scholar to whom miracles have been attributed. At eighteen, he married Bibi Kaneez Bano, the daughter of Sulaiman of Satrikh for whom the town, \"Sulaimanabad\" is named. Sulaiman was the nephew of Dawood Ghazi.\n\nBefore Zar-baqsh left on his pilgrimage, he gave to his son, Zaid, the hereditary and traditional family lore. He also asked that his first born grandson be named Mahmood. The child was born in 1100 AD and a village near Zaidpur was named Mahmoodpur after the boy.\n\nAfter the death of Zar-baqsh, Zaid retired to a life of solitude and devotion in the mohalla Gadhi-Qadeem in Zaidpur. Zaid died on 16th Rabi-us-Sani, 526 Hijri, 6 March 1132 AD at age 64 and was buried by his mother's side, near the Dada Abdullah Ka Talaab well on the outskirts of Zaidpur.\n\nMembers of the Saiyyed families of Zaidpur, the Badis and the Chotis became Taluqdars (feudal lords) of Awadh province.\n\nIn about 840 Hijri (1436 AD), Ali-ud-deen, son of Saif-ud-deen Saani, migrated from Zaidpur to Jaunpur. Ali-ud-deen's younger brother, Ziya-ud-deen (Ziya) remained in Zaidpur. Ali-ud-deen's son, Khair-ud-deen was a prosperous man who lived in Nahthor, Bijnaour district. His son, Dawood (Pyaare), grandson, Mohammad (Mangan) and great grandson, Mohammad Saeed also lived in Nahthor. Khair-ud-deen's great great grandson, Mohammad Ashraf (1557-1644 AD) was born in Nahthor. Mohammad Ashraf later moved to Amroha where he died in 1644 AD.\n\nMohammad Ashraf was a scholar who advocated the use of the intellect in everyday life as a way to find balance and reduce anxiety and extravagances. The Moghul emperor, Barbar, honoured Mohammad Ashraf with the title, \"Danishmand\".\n\nIn 1811 AD or earlier, a congregation hall (\"azakhana\" or \"imambarah\") and a mosque were built at Danishmandaan, Amroha, by Musammat in memory of her daughter. Further construction was done by Mehdi Raza Taqvi in 1946. Among eight structures at the azakhana, one was a school of Islamic theology, the Noor Ul Madaris.\n\nGhulam Husain was an historian, antiquarian and archaeologist. \"Salim\" was his \"Takh-al-lus\" (pen name). After moving to Malda, Salim became a \"dak munshi\" (post master) under George Udney, the English commercial resident of Malda. Salim was also a keen student of history. He deciphered inscriptions attached to Mosques and other monuments. He also visited Gaur and Pandua, the two Sultanate capitals of Bengal where most of the monuments were located. In 1786 AD, Udney asked Salim to write the history of Muslim rule. The \"Riyaz-us-Salatin\" (\"Garden of Kings\"), dated 1788 AD, was the first complete history of Muslim rule in Bengal. The book was written in Persian. It describes Muslim rule from Bakhtiyaar’s conquest of Nadia in 1204 and 1205 AD to the battle of Palasi in 1757 AD. Salim lived in a house which later became a charitable dispensary in Malda. Salim died in 1233 Hijri (1817 AD) and is buried in the Chak Qurban Ali quarter of Malda.\n\nKaram Ali of Zaidpur, the original owner of the Gotia Estate, was a Saiyed, an \"hakeem\" (a physician) and a land owner. The last owner of the estate was Haider Abbas Rizvi, a brigadier general of the 1st Punjab Regiment of Her Majesty's Royal Indian Army. He had inherited the land from his father, Mohammad Askari. At the time of Partition, Rizvi retired to Sialkot, in Punjab, Pakistan.\n\n\nEnterprises in Zaidpur include a postal service; bank; school; an LPG gas agency; sugar cane farming equipment sales; winnowing fan sales; cinema halls; medical services; and small scale textile manufacturing and hub for export quality handloom products and produced a lot of exporters (for example, Dinesh Enterprises scarves and cotton stoles from a tradition of hand-loom weaving).\n\nNoor Muhammad Inter College was founded by Noor Mohammad Seth. In 2007, a modern zaidpur gate with a height of 40 ft was designed and installed by his nephew, Fakhruddin Usmani and his daughter, Sabra Fakhruddin, during a visit from Karachi, Pakistan. also it consist of some private schoolMeritorious Kid's Dream Campus specially for (Playgroup to 5th )and colleges.\n"}

{"id": "2180722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180722", "title": "Endymion (poem)", "text": "Endymion (poem)\n\nEndymion is a poem by John Keats first published in 1818 by Taylor and Hessey of Fleet Street in London. It begins with the line \"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever\". \"Endymion\" is written in rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter (also known as heroic couplets). Keats based the poem on the Greek myth of Endymion, the shepherd beloved of the moon goddess Selene. The poem elaborates on the original story and renames Selene \"Cynthia\" (an alternative name for Artemis).\n\nIt starts by painting a rustic scene of trees, rivers, shepherds, and sheep. The shepherds gather around an altar and pray to Pan, god of shepherds and flocks. As the youths sing and dance, the elder men sit and talk about what life would be like in the shades of Elysium. However, Endymion, the \"brain-sick shepherd-prince\" of Mt. Latmos, is in a trancelike state, and not participating in their discourse. His sister, Peona, takes him away and brings him to her resting place where he sleeps. After he wakes, he tells Peona of his encounter with Cynthia, and how much he loved her.\n\nThe poem is divided into four books, each approximately 1,000 lines long. \"Book I\" gives Endymion's account of his dreams and experiences, as related to Peona, which provides the background for the rest of the poem. In \"Book II\", Endymion ventures into the underworld in search of his love. He encounters Adonis and Venus—a pairing of mortal and immortal—apparently foreshadowing a similar destiny for the mortal Endymion and his immortal paramour. \"Book III\" reveals Endymion's enduring love, and he begs the Moon not to torment him any longer as he journeys through a watery void on the sea floor. There he meets Glaucus, freeing the god from a thousand years of imprisonment by the witch Circe. \"Book IV\", \"And so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain.\" Endymion falls in love with a beautiful Indian maiden. Both ride winged black steeds to Mount Olympus where Cynthia awaits, only for Endymion to forsake the goddess for his new, mortal, love. Endymion and the Indian girl return to earth, the latter saying she cannot be his love. He is miserable, 'til quite suddenly he comes upon the Indian maiden again and she reveals that she is in fact Cynthia. She then tells him of how she tried to forget him, to move on, but that in the end, \"'There is not one,/ No, no, not one/ But thee.'\"\n\n\"Endymion\" received scathing criticism after its release, and Keats himself noted its diffuse and unappealing style. Keats did not regret writing it, as he likened the process to leaping into the ocean to become more acquainted with his surroundings; in a poem to J. A. Hessey, he expressed that \"I was never afraid of failure; for I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest.\" However, he did express regret in its publishing, saying \"it is not without a feeling of regret that I make [\"Endymion\"] public.\"\n\nNot all critics disliked the work. The poet Thomas Hood wrote 'Written in Keats' \"Endymion\"', in which the \"Muse... charming the air to music... gave back Endymion in a dreamlike tale\". Henry Morley said, \"The song of \"Endymion\" throbs throughout with a noble poet's sense of all that his art means for him. What mechanical defects there are in it may even serve to quicken our sense of the youth and freshness of this voice of aspiration.\"\n\nThis poem is quoted by Monsieur Verdoux in Charlie Chaplin's homonymous film, before committing a moonlit murder. \"Our feet were soft in flowers...\". \n\nThe first line (\"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever\") is quoted by Mary Poppins in the 1964 Disney movie, while she pulls out a potted plant from her bag. It is also referenced by Willy Wonka in the film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" upon introducing the Wonkamobile, and in the 1992 American sports comedy film \"White Men Can't Jump\", written and directed by Ron Shelton.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2180724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180724", "title": "Cymru Fydd", "text": "Cymru Fydd\n\nThe Cymru Fydd (Young Wales; ) movement was founded in 1886 by some of the London Welsh, including J. E. Lloyd, O. M. Edwards, T. E. Ellis (leader, MP for Merioneth, 1886–1899), Beriah Gwynfe Evans and Alfred Thomas. Initially it was a purely London-based society, later expanding to cities in England with a large Welsh population. \n\nThe founders of Cymru Fydd were influenced by the nationalist movement in Ireland, although the movement also drew upon other ideas, including a sense of imperial mission as preached by John Ruskin and a programme of social and political reform promoted by Arnold Toynbee and the Fabian Society. This was therefore in stark contrast to Irish Nationalism, under Charles Stewart Parnell and others, which sought separation from British political structures. The movement resembled the cultural nationalism found in parts of continental Europe, and heavily influenced by members of the intelligentsia such as O. M. Edwards and J. E. Lloyd.\n\nFrom 1892 branches were organised in Wales itself, the first being formed at Barry by W. Llewelyn Williams.\n\nIts main objective was to gain self-government for Wales. The movement lost some of its impetus following the withdrawal of T. E. Ellis to join the Government in 1892, after which the leadership of Cymru Fydd was taken over by David Lloyd George and Herbert Lewis (MP for Flint Boroughs). Cymru Fydd was re-launched on a narrower, more political basis.\n\nAfter an initial period of success in 1894–95, in which time it merged with the North Wales Liberal Federation (18 April 1895) to form the Welsh National Federation, it met with fierce opposition from the South Wales Liberal Federation, led by the Federation President, David Alfred Thomas (MP for Merthyr Tydfil 1889–1910).\n\nOn 16 January 1896, the proposal to merge the South Wales Liberal Federation with the Welsh National Federation was put to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the South Wales Liberal Federation, held at Newport, Monmouthshire. Lloyd George was howled down and refused permission to speak. After Robert Bird, a senior Cardiff alderman, declared his determination to resist \"the domination of Welsh ideas\", the merger proposal was defeated. Cymru Fydd collapsed soon afterwards. The effect of this collapse was particularly severe on the Women's Liberal Associations, all but 15 of which collapsed. Lloyd George switched his attention to British matters, next coming to prominence as an opponent of the Boer War.\n\nThe movement was supported by the magazine \"Young Wales\", edited by John Hugh Edwards between 1895 and its collapse in 1896. An earlier magazine, \"Cymru Fydd\", ceased publication in 1891.\n\n"}

{"id": "2180735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180735", "title": "True Crime: New York City", "text": "True Crime: New York City\n\nTrue Crime: New York City is a 2005 neo-noir open world action-adventure video game developed by Luxoflux for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube. It was ported to Microsoft Windows by Aspyr, and to mobile by Hands-On Mobile. It was published on all systems by Activision. The PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube versions were released in November 2005, the PC version in March 2006, and the mobile version in March 2007. It is the second entry in the \"True Crime\" franchise, after the 2003 \"\".\n\nThe game tells the story of Marcus Reed, a former New York City gang member turned police officer. On his first night on the job after receiving a promotion to detective in the Organized Crime Unit, Reed witnesses the death of his mentor. Helped by an FBI agent who is investigating a mole in the OCU, Reed sets about finding out who killed his friend and bringing down the mole. The game features a recreation of the borough of Manhattan, with most street names, major landmarks and highways reproduced with GPS accuracy.\n\n\"New York City\" received mixed reviews, with reviewers citing numerous technical and graphical glitches, leading many to speculate the final stages of development had been rushed. The game was also a commercial failure, selling only 72,000 units across all platforms in its first two weeks of release in North America, much less than \"Streets of LA\". Its lackluster critical response and poor sales figures partially contributed to the abandonment of the \"True Crime\" franchise. Originally intended as the first of a two-part series set in New York and featuring Marcus Reed, after the game's poor performance, Activision scrapped the direct sequel and put plans for future \"True Crime\" games on hold. In 2007, they hired United Front Games to develop an open world game set in Hong Kong. By 2009, this game had become \"True Crime: Hong Kong\". However, in 2011, the game was canceled. The publishing rights were picked up by Square Enix several months later, and \"True Crime: Hong Kong\" was ultimately released as \"Sleeping Dogs\", which has no connection to the \"True Crime\" series. In 2014, Activision dropped the \"True Crime\" trademark completely.\n\n\"True Crime\" is an open world action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, in which the player controls Detective Marcus Reed of the PDNY. There are four \"major cases\" in the game; the Magdalena Cartel, the Palermo Mob, the Presidents Club, and the Shadow Tong. When the game begins, only the Magdalena Cartel case is available for play, but once that case has been closed, the player is free to play the remaining three cases in any order they wish.\n\nThe game falls into the subgenre of \"Grand Theft Auto\" clones as the core gameplay and game mechanics are very similar to 2001's \"Grand Theft Auto III\", 2002's \"\", and 2004's \"\". The player can travel across the city freely, commandeer vehicles, do whatever they want in terms of attacking and/or killing innocent civilians, progress through the storyline at their own leisure, spending as much time traversing the city as they wish, and engage in minigames and sidequests. The three main sidequests are a street racing circuit, an underground fight club tournament, and securing confidential informants.\n\nA major difference from previous open world action-adventure video games, including the game's predecessor, \"\", is that many buildings throughout the city, beyond those related to the game's story, are accessible to the player. These include pharmacies, where the player can purchase medicine, and delis, where they can purchase food (both of which restore lost health), clothing stores where they can purchase new outfits, car dealers where they can purchase new cars, dojos where they can purchase new fighting techniques, record stores where they can purchase new songs for the game's soundtrack, gun stores where they can purchase new weaponry and ammunition, and other random buildings such as hotels, nightclubs, restaurants, and apartment buildings. Players can also purchase food from hot dog stands. In most business interiors, players can extort the owner for extra cash and/or plant evidence to make an arrest.\n\nAnother new addition to the \"True Crime\" franchise is the ability for the player to traverse the city not just on foot or by car, but by using public transport. The New York City subway system is available for use, and the player can also hail yellow taxis at any time, requesting transport to any point on the map. Both modes of transportation require a minimal fee.\n\nThe main game involves three main types of mission, each with its own unique gameplay; shooting, fighting and driving.\n\nDuring shooting missions, the game auto-targets the closest opponent. If the player wishes to switch target to another opponent, they must do so manually. When the player is in shooting mode, they can enter \"Precision Targeting\" at any time. At this point, the game switches to first-person, zooms in on the target, and goes into slow motion momentarily. While in Precision Targeting, if the targeting reticule turns blue, the player can hit the enemy with a neutralizing, non-lethal shot. If the player fires when the reticule is red, the enemy will be killed instantly. Players can also take cover during shootouts, firing from behind cover when the opportunity presents itself. Players are also free to pick up any weapons dropped by enemies. Once the ammo of these weapons is depleted, however, Reed will drop the weapon and revert to his standard issue .38 ACP handgun, which, although it does need to be reloaded, never runs out of ammo.\n\nIn hand-to-hand combat, the player has three main attacks; light attack, heavy attack, and grapple. When the player grapples an opponent, they are free to throw them, or hit them with a number of light and/or heavy attacks. At certain points during combat, the enemy will be stunned, and a meter will appear on-screen prompting the player to press either the heavy attack or light attack button as much as possible within a set time. The more times the player presses the button, the more devastating the resulting special attack. The player can also toggle between different fighting styles, and switch to using a melee weapon at any time.\nDriving missions can involve either trying to catch another car, or escape from another car. At all times, when the player is in a car, their car's condition is shown on screen. If the car's health meter empties, the car is close to destruction. As with \"Streets of LA\", during normal driving missions, the player can solve random crimes given by the radio dispatcher, although, unlike in the first game, these crimes can now take place inside buildings as well as on the streets. Additionally, the map is divided up into twenty different neighborhoods. When Reed solves a random crime in a particular area, the crime rate in that area drops. After he has solved a set number of crimes in one area, that area is considered \"clean,\" and crime rates will not increase (although random crimes will still occur within the area). If Reed continues to ignore random crimes in a given area before it is clean, the crime rate in that area will increase, leading to stores closing, dirtier streets, boarded up buildings, more aggressive civilians, and resulting in more random crimes needed to clean the area up.\n\nUnlike \"Streets of LA\", where the player could purchase upgrades at the costs of reward points and upon completion of a challenge, upgrades in \"New York City\" simply cost money, with no points system and no challenge in place. Upgrades become available for purchase as the player moves up through five grades of promotion. Money in the game can be earned legitimately by collecting wages, or illegitimately by selling evidence at pawn shops and/or extorting business owners.\n\nThe player also has a \"Good Cop/Bad Cop\" meter. If the player arrests criminals, solves crimes, shoots opponents with neutralizing shots, and knocks out rather than kills opponents, they will get Good Cop points. If, however, they kill civilians, kill unarmed criminals, shoot armed criminals in the head, fail to identify themselves as a police officer before opening fire, extort businesses, or sell evidence to pawn stores, they will get Bad Cop points. The player's status as a Good Cop or a Bad Cop will affect the game's ending. If the player performs actions that lead to Bad Cop points, it will also fill a rogue meter and when it gets too high, the player is considered to have \"gone rogue,\" and other police officers will begin to attack Reed.\n\nThe game begins in December 2000, with gangster Marcus Reed (voiced by Avery Waddell) arriving at the home of an associate who has betrayed him. Reed had been placed in charge of the organized crime empire run by his father, Isaiah \"The King\" Reed (Laurence Fishburne), who has been in prison for fifteen years. As an attempted hit was carried out on Reed in New York, someone stabbed Isaiah in jail. However, both father and son survived, and Reed now kills everyone who betrayed him. PDNY detective Terry Higgins (Mickey Rourke) then arrives on the scene. He is a close friend of Isaiah, and Reed's godfather, and he offers to cover up the killings, on the condition that Reed gets his life together.\n\nFive years later, Reed is now a PDNY officer, working as a beat cop under the command of Lt. Deena Dixon (Mariska Hargitay). However, he has applied for and been accepted into the Organized Crime Unit run by Chief Victor Navarro (Esai Morales), where he is partnered with Higgins. On Reed's first night, Higgins heads for a meeting at a warehouse, telling Reed he doesn't need to know the details. Moments after Higgins enters the building, it explodes, killing Higgins. In the aftermath, Navarro returns Reed to Dixon's command. She tells him he can keep his recently earned promotion and work plainclothes, but is not to investigate Higgins' death, as Navarro wants the investigation to remain internal to OCU. Shortly thereafter, Reed is contacted by FBI Special Agent Gabriel Whitting (Christopher Walken), who informs him there is a mole in the OCU. Whitting believes Higgins was about to reveal the identity of the mole, which is why he was killed. Prior to his death, Higgins told Whitting to bring Reed into the investigation should anything happen. All Whitting knows about the mole is that they are in contact with four major crime organizations in Manhattan.\n\nReed's first investigation is the Magdalena Cartel, believed to be responsible for 75% of New York's cocaine trade. Higgins had made contact with socialite and philanthropist Teresa Castillo (Socorro Santiago), who he believed may be able to help him get inside the cartel. She gives Reed information leading him to the Magdalena safe house, where he chases down their leader, Rey (Paolo Andino). However, Rey turns out to be head of the Latin Lords, the main rival of the Magdalena Cartel; the Cartel was using Reed to take out their competition. Reed discovers Teresa's real name is Magdalena Rojas, and she runs the cartel. He arrests her, but she tells him she doesn't know who the mole is, only that as their information was always accurate, she knows it is someone high up in the OCU.\n\nReed next goes after the Palermo Mob. Whitting tells him that when the last Don was imprisoned in 1995, the mob went into decline. Recently, however, the remnants have begun to organize. Whitting believes a new Don has emerged, but is unsure who it may be. After taking down the mob's lucrative illegal organ operation and interrogating the new don's right-hand man Alfie, Reed is led to the family's don, Vincent Tuzzi (Fred Berman). When Reed interrogates him, he says he never met the OCU mole; all their business was conducted over the phone. All Tuzzi knows is that he has a Spanish accent.\n\nReed next investigates the Presidents Club; a gang run by five men using pseudonyms of former Presidents of the United States. They control the supply of a new drug called \"Pop\", a combination of ecstasy and cocaine. Four of the leaders call themselves Lincoln, Hamilton, Jackson and Grant. The overall leader is called Benjamin, who takes ironic pride in the fact that Benjamin Franklin was never President. Whitting sends Reed to a drug den in Harlem run by Lincoln (Phil Morris). Lincoln leads Reed to Hamilton (Richard Yearwood), who tells him the Yakuza have declared war on the Presidents, and Jackson is on his way to kill the Yakuza's leader, Kobi (Jeanne Mori). Reed saves Kobi from a drive-by shooting, and kills Jackson. Kobi tells him Benjamin's real name is Lionel Jones (Cornell Womack), a famed rapper and music producer. Reed heads to Jones' factory, arriving in time to see Kobi's men killed by Grant (Greg Eagles). Grant leads Reed to Jones' building, where Reed fights through Jones' men to his zen garden on the roof, seeing him kill Kobi. He interrogates Jones, who tells him he doesn't know who the mole in the OCU is, except that he calls himself \"El Jefe.\"\n\nReed next goes after the Shadow Tong, a Triad outfit run by Leeland Shen (Jerry Ying). Whitting has only one way for Reed to make contact with Leeland; his step-sister, Vivian (Jennifer Chu) recently ran away, and Shen has been unable to find her. Witting tells Reed where she is, and Reed returns her to Leeland, pretending he wants to cut a deal for The King to distribute Leeland's merchandise in Harlem. Leeland puts Reed in contact with Lin (James Hong), who handles local distribution. However, Leeland discovers Reed is an undercover cop and orders Lin to kill him. Reed survives, and based on the information Lin has given him, goes to a Chinese dock ship where their human smuggling operation takes place. After he takes down the captain of the ship and interrogates him, Reed heads to Leeland's headquarters, where Leeland tells him he doesn't know who the mole is, but he does know a bribe is set to be picked up at a locker in Grand Central Station.\n\nReed calls Whitting, telling him he believes Navarro is the mole, and asking for a search warrant for the locker. Inside, they find the money, although Navarro claims he has been set up. Whitting arrests him, and, thinking the case closed, Reed heads home. However, in the subway, he is approached by Higgins. Reed immediately realizes Higgins was the mole all along; he knew Whitting was getting close to him so he faked his own death and then set up Navarro to take the fall. Higgins asks Reed to join him, offering him a bribe and threatens to expose his role in the massacre 5 years ago, but Reed refuses. He pursues Higgins through a subway car, eventually killing him. As a reward for Reed's work, Whitting promises to pull some strings to get Isaiah a hearing with the DA.\n\nIn an alternate \"Bad ending,\" Navarro kills Whitting when he tries to arrest him, and Reed pursues him into the subway, killing him. As Reed heads home, he is approached by Higgins. Reed is unsurprised, having realized Higgins had faked his own death. Higgins asks Reed to join him in Mexico, but Reed kills him. The game ends with Reed sitting in the subway station contemplating what to do with Higgins' money.\n\nThe game was first announced on July 21, 2004, when Activision CEO Ron Doornink announced plans for \"sequels to \"\", \"Call of Duty\", \"Spider-Man\", \"Tony Hawk\", \"Shrek\", and \"Quake\".\" However, nothing more was heard about the game for almost a year; until May 2005, when Activision revealed that the game was so big, developers Luxoflux had drafted in staff from another Activision owned developer, Z-Axis. The game, under the provisional title \"True Crime 2\", was unofficially scheduled for a third quarter release, and was expected to be unveiled at the upcoming E3 event. Doornink stated \"In the third quarter, we plan to release our strongest and most diverse lineup ever--specifically, brand-new games for \"Tony Hawk\", \"Call of Duty\", \"\", \"True Crime\", \"Quake\", and \"Shrek\". Each of these franchises is targeted at a different consumer.\"\nOn May 18, Activision debuted a trailer for the game. The trailer revealed nothing about the plot or the location, but simply featured Marcus Reed arresting some criminals. Attached to the trailer was a competition called \"\"True Crime\": Guess the City and Win Marcus' Ride.\" Players were encouraged to go to the game's official website and guess in which city they think the game is set. The competition's winner would win a Chrysler 300, Reed's car when the game begins. At the E3 event, Activision dedicated a large part of their booth to the upcoming game, but no footage was made available, nor was any plot information, or even a title, with the game now going by \"True Crime 2005\". The Chrysler available in the competition was present, as were DJs playing songs which would be featured in the game. All that was confirmed at E3 was that the game would definitely be released on current generation systems.\n\nOn June 22, 2005, \"True Crime\"s official website revealed the game would take place in New York City, with an image of the Manhattan skyline appearing as the site's wallpaper. In August, IGN published an interview with former NYPD detective Bill Clark, who had previously served as executive producer and technical advisor of \"NYPD Blue\", and was now working as head technical advisor for \"True Crime: New York City\". Clarke has been with the NYPD for twenty-five years, seventeen in homicide. During his time on the force, he was involved in such major cases as the Son of Sam investigation, and the collapse of several of the \"Five Families\". Of his involvement with the game, Clarke stated\n\nIn his efforts to help Activision make the best game they could, Clarke found a compromise had to be reached between reality and the nature of videogaming;\n\nA work-in-progress build of the game was first shown on September 7. Activision revealed the basic plot and announced the branching storyline system from \"Streets of LA\" was not being used. Instead, when the player fails a mission, they would simply be given the option to replay it, meaning story content wouldn't be missed. They also announced several features new to the game, including a continuous day/night cycle, a more populated city than Los Angeles in \"Streets of LA\", a much darker palette than the first game, more cars and vehicles, the ability to travel by taxi or subway, and the ability to enter buildings beyond those related to plot. They also explained the precinct component of the game; if the player ignores random crimes in particular areas, shops will begin to close down, the city streets will become dirtier and buildings will be boarded up. It was also revealed the playing area would be .\nThe following week, the main voice cast was announced, including Laurence Fishburne, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, Mariska Hargitay, Esai Morales, and Traci Lords. Marcus Reed would be voiced by Avery Waddell. Details of the soundtrack were released a week later. The soundtrack's headliner was Redman, who was recording an original song for the game, and would also be an unlocakble character with his own minigame, much as Snoop Dogg had in \"Streets of LA\". Tim Riley, worldwide executive of music at Activision, stated \"As an East Coast artist who paid his dues performing in the clubs of New York City, Redman's inspired rhymes bring the gritty realism of the city to life in our game. His bold lyrics and hard-edged funk beats capture the vibes of the city, from Washington Heights to Harlem and all the way down to Battery Park.\" Activision also announced that although the game had only one original song, it would feature over eighty licensed tracks from artists such as Jay Z, Fat Joe, A Tribe Called Quest, The Ramones, The Velvet Underground, My Chemical Romance, The Bravery, and Bob Dylan.\n\nAs part of the video game's launch, PUMA announced a unique sneaker mission within the game, and the production of a special edition sneaker. In the game, if players find all of the True Crime RS-100 sneakers throughout the city and return them to real New York City retailers featured in the game, the player unlocks an exclusive PUMA outfit for Reed. In addition, players could purchase the limited-edition True Crime RS-100 sneakers within the same New York City stores in the real world.\n\nOn September 26, 2005, Raymond Kelly (New York City Police Commissioner) and Patrick Lynch (president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New York) called for a boycott of the game, citing its depiction of law-breaking police officers as damaging and offensive. In an interview with the \"New York Daily News\", Kelly stated \"It's an outrage. I think it disrespects all police officers.\" Although the game was made in conjunction with two former NYPD detectives, Bill Clarke and Tom Walker (author of \"Fort Apache: The Bronx\"), and although the police force in the game is called the PDNY (as opposed to the real life NYPD), Kelly stated \"It's totally inappropriate. It's a tough job, a dangerous job, and this undermines what police officers try to do. I'm saddened that some former members of the department are linked to that video game.\" Lynch said of Clarke, \"The cop who worked on this video should look in the mirror. He makes it harder for everyone working the job.\" Clark responded by commenting that police unions \"should stop worrying about video games and spend more time getting cops more than a $25,000 starting salary.\"\n\n\"True Crime: New York City\" received \"mixed or average reviews\" across all systems; the PlayStation 2 version holds an aggregate score of 60 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on forty-seven reviews; the Xbox version 60 out of 100, based on forty-three reviews, the GameCube version 59 out of 100, based on twenty-five reviews; and the PC version 54 out of 100, based on twelve reviews.\n\nIGN's Chris Roper scored the console versions 7.8 out of 10, praising \"how well your general duties as a cop are tied into the game, working very well alongside your own personal investigations,\" and finding the gameplay and game mechanics superior to \"Streets of LA\". His main criticism was \"it doesn't really take any risks [...] it doesn't feel like it's an altogether new gaming experience.\" However, he wrote \"\"True Crime\"s strengths lie in the solid ways that everything is put together.\" He concluded \"it's a solid title through and through, but you won't find a whole lot of water cooler moments in there [...] If you're tired of the whole \"GTA\" thing and want more substance, this may not be the game for you. For everyone else though, \"TC: NYC\" is definitely worth checking out.\" He scored the PC version 6.5 out of 10, and was critical of Aspyr's work on the port; \"it seems the company did little more than get the game up and running on the PC and didn't bother to fine-tune a few of the controls for the system.\" He was highly critical of the graphics; \"Pop-up is a major problem [...] LOD on characters is also pretty screwy, with entirely mis-matched low-res models filling in for some characters [...] shadows and such pop in and out of view, camera movement during cutscenes would cut at odd times or display the wrong angle for a split second, etc. etc. It simply feels unpolished.\"\n\nEurogamer's Jim Rossignol scored the PlayStation 2 version 6 out of 10, writing \"\"True Crime\" trips over its own inflated Nikes with just a few too many moments of lamentable emptiness.\" He was critical of the AI; \"The perps you take down never suggest that they are anything other than mindless automata ready to be slain, and exhibit an artificiality that could never be described as 'intelligence'.\" He also compared the game unfavorably to \"\"; \"while artistically more accomplished, \"New York City\" lacks the personality of the big daddy. And there is little in the way of humour.\"\n\nGameSpy's Sterling McGarvey scored the PlayStation 2 version 2.5 out of 5, writing Luxoflux have \"turned a slightly above-par \"GTA\" clone into a sub-par franchise.\" He was critical of the recreation of New York; \"textures look rather drab and plain, and the draw distance looks blurry and uninteresting [...] it really feels as though the development team failed to capture one of New York's most distinctive traits: the raw humanity of it all.\" Of the graphics, he wrote, \"the frame rate has a knack for chugging. Considering it's a console and not a five year-old PC running this game, it's unacceptable. Out of nowhere, the frame rate will completely bottom out while Marcus patrols the streets.\" He concluded by criticizing the game for being unfinished, arguing anyone who buys it will \"have dropped their hard-earned money to beta test a truly unfinished game.\"\n\nGameSpot's Greg Mueller was extremely unimpressed, scoring the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions 4.6 out of 10, and the Xbox version 4.3 out of 10. He accused the game of being \"so riddled with problems that it feels like it was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays.\" He cited \"bugs that will make you randomly fall through the ground into a bunch of nothingness, bugs that make textures change when you get in and out of a car, bugs that cause you to inadvertently break a scripted sequence, thus making it impossible to complete a mission. There are also collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck on the edge of a platform. That's not all--the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too.\" He concluded \"\"True Crime: New York City\" should be avoided regardless of whether or not you enjoyed the first \"True Crime\". The gameplay has a few almost-decent spots, but the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try.\" He scored the PC version 5.2 out of 10, writing, \"while it manages to address some of the more egregious glitches that appeared in the console versions of the game, it still doesn't feel like a finished product.\"\n\n\"True Crime: New York City\" did not sell well, falling considerably short of Activision's expectations. In North America, \"True Crime: Streets of LA\" sold over 300,000 units across all platforms in its first week. By the end of its first month, it had sold over 600,000 units. Ultimately, it went on to sell over 3 million units worldwide across all platforms. By contrast, \"New York City\" sold only 72,000 units in its first two weeks, earning only $3.6 million.\n\nAt the 2005 Spike Video Game Awards, \"True Crime\" was nominated for four awards; \"Cyber Vixen of the Year\" (Traci Lords as Cassandra Hartz), \"Best Supporting Male Performance\" (Christopher Walken as Gabrial Whitting), and two \"Best Supporting Female\" nominations (Traci Lords as Cassandra Hartz and Mariska Hargitay as Deena Dixon). It won \"Best Supporting Male Performance\" and Lords won \"Best Supporting Female Performance.\" Cyber Vixen of the Year was won by Maria Menounos as Eva in \"James Bond 007: From Russia with Love\".\n\n\"True Crime: New York City\" was originally intended to have been the first part of a two-part series set in New York and featuring Marcus Reed, but the second part was never made.\n\nDue to the game's critical and commercial failure, Activision dropped plans for any future \"True Crime\" games. However, towards the end of 2007, they approached United Front Games to develop an open world game for next generation consoles set in Hong Kong, and unrelated to the \"True Crime\" series. Originally called \"Black Lotus\", the game went into production in early 2008. A year into development, Activision proposed that \"Black Lotus\" be incorporated into the \"True Crime\" franchise, due to the similarities in their designs and plots; all three games were set in open worlds with narratives centered on an undercover cop in a criminal organization. Activision hoped the new ideas brought to the table by United Front could help revitalize the \"True Crime\" franchise. At the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, Activision debuted the game as \"True Crime: Hong Kong\". Although originally slated for a Fall 2010 release, in May 2010, Activision announced the game had been pushed back to early 2011 \"in order to give the development team more time to deliver the high-quality entertainment experience they envision for the game.\"\n\nIn February 2011, however, Activision cancelled \"True Crime: Hong Kong\", claiming that due to \"quality issues,\" further investment would not make the game competitive in the open world genre. United Front executive producer Stephen Van Der Mescht expressed disappointment with Activision's decision, stating the game was \"playable from start to finish and virtually complete in terms of content.\" In June, Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg explained that an escalating budget and development delays were the main contributing factors in the game's cancellation. Hirshberg stated that the increase in budget and subsequent delays meant the game would have to be \"a pretty incredible success in order to be worth the investment that it was taking to get it done.\" Due to competition posed by other titles, particularly \"Grand Theft Auto\" and \"Red Dead Redemption\", and the fact that the previous game in the \"True Crime\" series had been a critical and commercial failure, Activision's view was that the game would not be able to compete.\n\nHowever, in August, Square Enix acquired the publishing rights to the game, although they did not buy the rights to the \"True Crime\" franchise, which were retained by Activision. Ultimately, the game was renamed \"Sleeping Dogs\" and released in August 2012. In December 2014, Activision abandoned the \"True Crime\" trademark completely.\n"}

Stetson, John Wanamaker, Henry W. Breyer, Jay Cooke, William Lukens Elkins and Peter A.B. Widener. In the later 20th century it was home to Ralph J. Roberts, co-founder of Comcast, as well as to the Gimbels family, founders of the department store chain.\n\nToday it remains home to many gilded age mansions such as Lynnewood Hall, a 110-room, neoclassical estate, the Elkins Estate presently being restored as a hotel-spa, distillery and events center and the Henry West Breyer Sr. House, the former residence of the ice cream magnate which now serves as the Cheltenham Township Municipal building.\n\nElkins Park is notable for its varied architectural styles (among them: Modern, American colonial and Dutch colonial, Queen Anne, English Cottage and Tudor) its wealth of homes designed by renowned 19th and 20th century architects such as Horace Trumbauer, Louis Kahn and Robert A.M. Stern and its diversity of religious institutions. With six synagogues it also makes up the foundation of the \"Old York Road Corridor\" of the Philadelphia area Jewish community, supported by the approximately 25,000 Jews in the Cheltenham-Jenkintown-Abington region.\n\n\nElkins Park is split between Cheltenham and Abington Townships in the suburbs of Philadelphia.

If the intersection form is positive (negative) definite, it can be diagonalized to the identity matrix (negative identity matrix) over the .\n\nThe theorem was proved by Simon Donaldson. This was a contribution cited for his Fields medal in 1986.\n\nDonaldson's proof utilizes the moduli space formula_1 of solutions to the anti-self-duality equations on a principal formula_2-bundle formula_3 over the four-manifold. By the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, the dimension of the moduli space is given by\n\nwhere formula_5, formula_6 is the first Betti number of formula_7 and formula_8 is the dimension of the positive-definite subspace of formula_9 with respect to the intersection form. When formula_7 is simply-connected with definite intersection form, possibly after changing orientation, one always has formula_11 and formula_12. Thus taking any principal formula_2-bundle with formula_14, one obtains a moduli space formula_15 of dimension five. \n\nThis moduli space is non-compact and generically smooth, with singularities occurring only at the points corresponding to reducible connections, of which there are exactly formula_16 many. Results of Clifford Taubes and Karen Uhlenbeck show that whilst formula_15 is non-compact, its structure at infinity can be readily described. Namely, there is an open subset of formula_15, say formula_19, such that for sufficiently small choices of parameter formula_20, there is a diffeomorphism\n\nThe work of Taubes and Uhlenbeck essentially concerns constructing sequences of ASD connections on the four-manifold formula_7 with curvature becoming infinitely concentrated at any given single point formula_23. For each such point, in the limit one obtains a unique singular ASD connection, which becomes a well-defined smooth ASD connection at that point using Uhlenbeck's removable singularity theorem.\n\nDonaldson observed that the singular points in the interior of formula_15 corresponding to reducible connections could also be described: they looked like cones over the complex projective plane formula_25, with its orientation reversed.\n\nIt is thus possible to compactify the moduli space as follows: First, cut off each cone at a reducible singularity and glue in a copy of formula_25. Secondly, glue in a copy of formula_7 itself at infinity. The resulting space is a cobordism between formula_7 and a disjoint union of formula_16 copies of formula_25 with its orientation reversed. The intersection form of a four-manifold is a cobordism invariant up to isomorphism of quadratic forms, from which one concludes the intersection form of formula_7 is diagonalisable.\n\nMichael Freedman had previously shown that any unimodular symmetric bilinear form is realized as the intersection form of some closed, oriented four-manifold. Combining this result with the Serre classification theorem and Donaldson's theorem, several interesting results can be seen:\n\n1) Any non-diagonalizable intersection form gives rise to a four-dimensional topological manifold with no differentiable structure (so cannot be smoothed).\n\n2) Two smooth simply-connected 4-manifolds are homeomorphic, if and only if, their intersection forms have the same rank, signature, and parity.\n\n\n"}

It was first presented to the press at a Paris restaurant named \"Les Ambassadeurs\" on 17 June 1953 and went into production the following year. In 1959 it was replaced by the Panhard PL 17.\n\nPanhard was one of the world's oldest auto manufacturers and since 1945 had become known for producing economical cars. Panhard, like Citroën, considered itself a leader, not a follower of automotive trends, and the Dyna Z featured an impressive array of unusual engineering choices.\n\nIn 1955 Citroën had taken a 25% holding in Panhard's automobile business and during the next two years the national dealership networks of the two businesses were integrated. This gave Citroen and Panhard dealers an expanded market coverage, incorporating now a small car, a medium-sized saloon and a large car range. It gave the Panhard Dyna Z, during its final years in production, a level of market access that its predecessor had never enjoyed. Sales benefited.\n\nThe Dyna X was replaced by the more streamlined Dyna Z in 1954. This was later developed into the similar PL 17, launched in 1959, in an attempt to conform to the styles of the time.\n\nLike its predecessor the Dyna X and the Panhard Dynavia concept that influenced its design, the Dyna Z's body was originally aluminium with steel tube subframes front and rear joined by steel plate reinforcements in the sills. The decision to use aluminium sheeting for car bodies had been taken at a time when a sudden drop off in demand for fighter planes had left the producers with a glut of the metal, but in subsequent years the relative cost advantage of sheet steel had increased steadily. Other sources emphasize an underlying error with the original costings for the model which had taken no account of the off-cuts from the aluminium coils after the blanks for the body panels had been cut from them. 's explanation to a sympathetic interviewer concludes with the observation that \"nobody wanted to buy offcuts except at a ridiculously low price, this difference was our profit margin.\" In Summer 1954 the cost penalty of persisting with aluminium bodywork had become financially unsustainable, and from September 1955 the Dynas Type \"Z1\" switched to steel bodywork, even though the door shells, trunk/boot and hood/bonnet were at this stage still made of aluminium. The switch to a sheet-steel body shell, attributed to \"various setbacks\" (\"\"nombreuses déboires\"\") with the aluminium body of the earlier Type Z1, imposed an instant weight penalty of 123 Kg. and had to be accompanied by a substantial redesign of the front suspension and a change to the shock absorbers, though cost savings were too late to avoid the need for Panhard to sign their ultimately suicidal refinancing \"agreement\" with Citroën in April 1955.\n\nBy 1958, only the bumpers, the fuel tank, the engine cooling shroud and most of the engine and transaxle cases were aluminium, but the weight was still quite low for a relatively comfortable six-seater saloon, when compared with narrower competitor models from Peugeot and Simca. Its unusual and very modern design gave it a unique combination of space, ride comfort, performance and fuel economy at a very competitive price. But reliability suffered and fuel prices were not high enough, even in France, for people to put energy efficiency first. The car also suffered from some engine and wind noise. The Tiger version had a racing inspired engine and a full cooling shroud.\n\nΕnhanced specification/performance version as sold in the US:\n\n\n"}

He was the older brother of wrestlers Paul and Vivian Vachon, and the uncle of wrestler Luna Vachon.\n\nVachon started his career as an amateur wrestler, participating in the 1948 Summer Olympics and winning a gold medal at the 1950 British Empire Games. He made the switch to professional wrestling and spent time in various promotions in the United States while occasionally teaming with his brother Paul. In Portland, Oregon, he received the name \"Mad Dog\" Vachon. In the early 1960s, Vachon became a main eventer in the American Wrestling Association. He was one of the promotion's all-time great heels, known for his wild style and intense interviews. He was a five-time AWA World Heavyweight Champion. Starting in the 1970s, Vachon became a fan favourite, particularly in his home province of Quebec.\n\nAfter a stint in the World Wrestling Federation, Vachon retired from the business in 1986. The following year, he was struck by a hit-and-run driver, resulting in the amputation of one of his legs. Vachon was highly influential, especially in Canada, and was inducted into numerous professional wrestling Halls of Fame.\n\nJoseph Maurice Régis Vachon was born on September 14, 1929. The godfather was Maurice Picard, his uncle and the godmother was Victoria Ouellet, his maternal grandmother; he was the second child of 13 children of Montreal policeman Ferdinand Vachon and Marguerite Picard. He grew up in the district of Ville-Émard, a working-class borough southwest of Montreal, Quebec. As a child, he regularly attended wrestling shows at the nearby Montreal Forum, where he grew up idolizing local ring legend Yvon Robert; and at just 12 years old, he had already begun grappling at the area's YMCA. At the YMCA he was coached by Frank Saxton, a former coach of the Canadian amateur team. Vachon entered a wrestling course advertised at the back of a comic book, and he began training under Chief Jim Crowley. He trained hard and even worked in the docks and on the canal to build up his muscle. By age 14, Vachon eventually established himself among Canada's premier amateur grapplers.\n\nAt the age of 18, he competed in the 1948 Olympic Games in London, where he pinned the Indian champion in 54 seconds. Vachon ultimately finished in seventh place at 174 pounds after losing to eventual silver medalist Adil Candemir of Turkey. Moreover, it was at the 1948 Olympics where Vachon first encountered an American Greco-Roman competitor named Verne Gagne. He rebounded to win the gold medal at the 1950 British Empire Games in New Zealand. He then spent several years working as a bouncer at a Montreal nightclub, where he gained a reputation of being willing to fight anyone, before he was encouraged to join the pro wrestling circuit in 1951.\n\nVachon initially debuted as a junior heavyweight for Ontario booker Larry Kasaboski; and during his first year as a pro, he won a tournament in Sudbury to claim the North American Junior Heavyweight Title. However, Vachon soon encountered a roadblock when powerful Montreal promoter Eddie Quinn was hesitant to use him for fear that Vachon would dethrone Yvon Robert, who was still his top drawing card. Consequently, Vachon then took to the road; and in April 1955, he teamed with Pierre LaSalle to capture the NWA Texas Tag Team Titles.\n\nDespite his exceptional grappling ability, Maurice Vachon nonetheless struggled to distinguish himself from the myriad of image-less grapplers during his early years. As a result, he soon took radical measures to differentiate his persona, bulking up to a more plausible 225 pounds while also shaving his head bald and growing a long goatee. In addition, Vachon would frequently buy local TV time prior to a weekend event, which he then used to boldly proclaim his supremacy while also deprecating his opponent. Such acts of bravado were considered revolutionary at the time, though it was successful in that it attracted attention to Vachon's new character as well as drawing additional fans to the arena. As a result, Vachon subsequently established himself as a major heel while also portraying a wrestling beast inside the ring who would freely stomp, bite, and pound his opponent into submission. According to Vachon, the name \"Mad Dog\" was given to him in 1962 by Portland promoter Don Owen after a particularly violent match. \"During the match I went outside the ring and started to turn everything upside down. A policeman tried to stop me and I hit him too,\" said Vachon. Afterwards Owen told him, \"You just looked like a real mad dog out there.\"\n\nBefore long, \"Mad Dog\" Vachon consequently developed a reputation as perhaps the most feared rulebreaker in all of wrestling. Furthermore, Maurice's younger brother Paul - ultimately known as \"The Butcher\" - soon also made his debut and on February 17, 1959 the Vachon brothers teamed to defeat Chico Garcia and Chet Wallick for the NWA Canadian Tag Team Titles. Vachon's tendency to hurt his opponents with foreign objects, filed fingernails and teeth, and the multiple use of his signature finishing move, the Piledriver, to end matches made him notorious in the business and caused him to be banned in three U.S. states. But it also made his popularity soar among the fans.\n\nHe also met his future wife Kathie Joe at a wrestling event, after spitting a shoe string he had used for choking his opponent at her, as she was sitting in the audience.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Mad Dog Vachon was then recruited to the Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association by his old Olympics acquaintance Verne Gagne, who had replaced Tony Stecher as the region's chief promoter in 1960 and who also served as its centerpiece champion. Upon debuting, Vachon immediately established himself among the promotion's top box-office draws as fans despised his vicious, mauling tactics; and he thus made the perfect opponent for the All-American Gagne, as the two rivals soon commenced an ongoing battle that would persist on for nearly 20 years. On May 2, 1964, Vachon stunned audiences when he upset Gagne for the AWA World Heavyweight Title, and although Gagne regained the belt just two weeks later, Mad Dog again recaptured the title when he defeated Gagne on October 20 in Minneapolis. Between 1964–67, Mad Dog Vachon would ultimately hold five reigns as the AWA World Champion while taking on all comers within the promotion's massive territory, including Gagne, Mighty Igor Vodic, as well as the legendary powerhouse duo of Crusher Lisowski and Dick the Bruiser.\n\nMad Dog Vachon's final AWA title reign came to an end on February 26, 1967, at the hands of his nemesis Verne Gagne; and he then briefly left the promotion in order to return to his native Montreal territory, where he captured two reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight Champion while feuding against Johnny Rougeau and Hans Schmidt. Moreover, Vachon would also leverage his close friendship with Montreal Canadiens legend Jean Beliveau to convince the authorities of the Montreal Forum to grant him a promoting license (despite the protests of Johnny Rougeau and Bob Langevin, who had taken over the region from Eddie Quinn during the mid-1960s). Nevertheless, Vachon would soon return to the AWA, where he resumed his fierce battles with The Crusher and Dick the Bruiser, regarded by some as the greatest tag team of all-time, while forming a highly successful and dangerous tandem with his brother Paul \"Butcher\" Vachon. On August 30, 1969, the Vachons defeated Crusher & Bruiser for the AWA World Tag Team Titles; and the following year, the two battled again in a famous steel cage match at Chicago's Comiskey Park (where the Vachons again emerged victorious), as their violent fights ultimately served as the precursor for a new brand of sadistic and vicious brawling that would spawn future mayhem stars like Abdullah the Butcher, Bruiser Brody, Stan Hansen, and others.\n\nOn July 14, 1973, Vachon had a match with Killer Kowalski for Grand Prix Wrestling at Montreal's Jarry Park. The match drew a crowd of 29,127, which is the largest wrestling crowd in Quebec history. Prior to the match, Vachon had vowed to commit suicide if he didn't win. Following Vachon's victory, the headline of a Montreal newspaper read \"Vachon triumphs in front of 30,000 people and gives up on suicide!\"\n\nThe Vachon family became prominent in the AWA with sister Vivian dominating the women's scene, while Maurice and Paul ruled the men's division. In the early 1970s he even appeared alongside Vivian in the motion picture \"Wrestling Queen\". After two decades as one the wrestling's most evil characters, the fans began to rally behind the \"Mad Dog\" in the late 1970s when he formed an unexpected and odd friendship with ex-archrival Verne Gagne. The unlikely partners made for an impressive tag team, and on June 6, 1979, they beat Pat Patterson & Ray Stevens to capture the AWA tag titles, which they held for over a year before losing to Jesse Ventura & Adrian Adonis. When the AWA began looking to younger stars like Rick Martel and Curt Hennig, Vachon jumped to the World Wrestling Federation in 1983. While his age and lack of size did not make for a good mix in the emerging \"Hulkamania\" era, the now-face (fan favorite) Vachon was usually included at WWF house shows (wrestling cards) in the Midwest and Quebec. He wrestled for the WWF in Canada regularly until 1986, and even contributed to the WWF's French programming by doing a weekly interview segment in French titled \"Le Brunch a Mad Dog\". While contracted with the WWF, Vachon was allowed to participate in events not featuring the WWF while in Canada.\n\nIn 1985, he appeared as cornerman for AWA World Champion Rick Martel when Martel was challenged by Boris Zhukov in several title bouts in Canada, getting involved in one match on September 19, 1985 in Winnipeg and fighting off Zhukov and his manager, Chris Markoff, after Markoff interfered and helped Zhukov attack Martel, while in a later rematch between Martel and Zhukov held in a steel cage on November 14, 1985 in the same city, Markoff was neutralized by being handcuffed to Vachon. Vachon received a retirement show in his native Montreal in September 1986, and he left the sport as one its most beloved fan favorites after spending almost his entire career as a sadistic villain. His innovative portrayal of a snarling, bloodthirsty monster would inspire a myriad of future \"psychotic\" wrestlers. According to the WWE, \"In later years, Mad Dog's legacy was carried on by his niece, the memorably twisted Luna Vachon, and notable brawlers who adopted Vachon's wild ring style like Bruiser Brody and George \"The Animal\" Steele.\"\n\nVachon was known for his wild personality and uncontrollable character, as well as his unique interview style. \"He was the first wrestler to understand the power of television. He was the first wrestler to speak to the camera. That was never done before.\" said Yves Theriault, who directed a documentary on Vachon in 2009. Vachon was also very influential in his home province of Quebec. Pat LaPrade, author of the \"Mad Dogs, Midgets and Screw Jobs\", a book on Quebec wrestling history, considers Vachon one of the two most important Quebec wrestlers along with Yvon Robert. He added, \"[Vachon is] the best-known Quebec wrestler outside of Quebec. A legend.\"\n\nIn the book \"The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Canadians\", author Greg Oliver ranks Vachon fourth amongst Canadian wrestlers, behind Whipper Billy Watson, Yvon Robert and Killer Kowalski. Vachon was also included in Oliver's book on villainous wrestlers and was ranked fourth.\n\nUpon retiring, Vachon settled in Carter Lake, Iowa with his third wife Kathy Joe. Tragedy struck in 1987 when Vachon was struck by a hit-and-run driver, resulting in the amputation of one of his legs. It was later revealed that he had been struck by a developmentally challenged male driving the country roads looking for cans to recycle while Vachon was out for a morning jog. The man apparently had no insurance and was never charged. The Vachons moved to Omaha shortly thereafter. He later turned to acting in beer commercials and was a restaurant critic for a Quebec City television station.\n\nHe appeared at the WWF pay-per-view , that was held in Omaha. He was sitting in the front row near ringside, when his artificial leg was ripped off by wrestler Diesel and used as a weapon by Shawn Michaels. In addition, he and longtime rival The Crusher made an appearance at the 1998 Over the Edge pay-per-view, in a segment where the two legends were mocked by Jerry Lawler, including Lawler trying to steal the artificial leg. Crusher and Mad Dog then punched Lawler out of the ring. He had knee surgery in 2008. On March 27, 2010, he was inducted into the 2010 WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nVachon, who in his last years suffered from diabetes and was confined to a wheelchair, died in his sleep on November 21, 2013, at the age of 84. He had six children, seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. His remains were cremated.\n\nOn November 28, 2018, Vachon was posthumously inducted into the Omaha Pro Wrestling Hall Of Fame at the PWP Live \"Wrestlerama\" event at The Waiting Room Lounge in Omaha.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2180818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180818", "title": "All Star Wrestling", "text": "All Star Wrestling\n\nAll Star Wrestling is a British Professional wrestling promotion also known as All Star Promotions, Superslam Wrestling and Big Time Wrestling and originally known as Wrestling Enterprises (of Birkenhead), run by Brian Dixon and based in Liverpool, England. Dixon's promotion tours theatres, leisure centres, town halls and similar venues, many of them old venues for televised wrestling in the UK in the 1950s-1980s, as well as holiday camps. It is the oldest active wrestling promotion in the UK, and furthermore the longest-running UK wrestling promotion ever - a record it has held since September 2013, when it eclipsed the 42 years and 11 months lifespan of Joint Promotions/Ring Wrestling Stars (March 1952– February 1995). It is also the third oldest professional wrestling promotion still in existence in the world, after Mexico's CMLL (founded 1933) and America's WWE (founded 1963 as WWWF).\n\nAll Star contributed to the final two years of ITV's regular televised wrestling programme in the UK in 1987-1988 and some of their matches were included on VHS and DVD compilations and repeated as part of the World of Sport programming on The Fight Network, formerly The Wrestling Channel, until it stopped transmission in 2008. They were then repeated on the now defunct Men & Movies channel.\n\nBrian Dixon, a wrestling referee and former head of the Jim Breaks Fan Club, established Wrestling Enterprises in October 1970 initially as a vehicle for his girlfriend (and later wife) British Ladies' Champion Mitzi Mueller, who was having difficulty getting bookings from Joint Promotions. One of the company's earliest claims to fame was rebranding Martin Ruane (formerly Luke McMasters in the WFGB in the late 1960s) as new character \"Giant Haystacks\", originally \"Haystacks Calhoun\" patterned after the US superheavyweight wrestler of the same name and similar image about whom Dixon had read in imported American wrestling magazines. Haystacks would go on to achieve household fame in the UK after he moved to Joint Promotions in 1975 as the tag team partner - and later the archenemy - of Big Daddy.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Wrestling Enterprises held regular major shows at the Liverpool Stadium and organised a version of the World Middleweight Title after the previous version became extinct with the collapse of the Spanish wrestling scene c. 1975. This title continued until champion Adrian Street emigrated to America in 1981. Wrestling Enterprises also collaborated heavily with another independent promoter, former middleweight star Jackie Pallo. Neither promoter was able to gain a slice of ITV coverage however, as the 1981 contract renewal negotiations resulted in a five-year extension on Joint Promotions' exclusive monopoly of ITV wrestling.\n\nBy the early 1980s there was increasing dissatisfaction among both fans and wrestlers with the direction of Joint Promotions (which was increasingly centred on Big Daddy), which resulted in a steady flow of top UK talent into All Star Wrestling (as it was by then renamed) and away from Joint and the TV spotlight. Title-holders such as World Heavyweight Champion Mighty John Quinn, rival claimant Wayne Bridges, British Heavyweight Champion Tony St Clair, World Heavy-Middleweight Champion Mark Rocco, British Heavy-Middleweight Champion Frank 'Chic' Cullen and World Lightweight Champion Johnny Saint all defected to All Star taking their titles with them, as did many non-titleholders. By the mid-1980s All Star was running shows head-to-head with Joint Promotions and had its own TV show on satellite channel Screensport.\n\nWhen Joint's five-year extension on its monopoly of ITV wrestling expired at the end of 1986, All Star, along with the WWF, was also given a share of the televised wrestling shows for the two years 1987-88. The beginning of this period coincided with the return to full-time action for legendary masked wrestler Kendo Nagasaki under the All Star banner. At the end of 1988, Greg Dyke cancelled wrestling on ITV after 33 years. Whereas Joint dwindled downwards as a touring vehicle for Big Daddy (and later Davey Boy Smith) before finally folding in 1995, All Star had played its cards well with regard to its two years of TV exposure, using the time in particular to build up a returning Kendo Nagasaki as its lead heel and establishing such storylines as his tag team-cum-feud with Rollerball Rocco and his \"hypnotism\" of Robbie Brookside.\n\nThe end of TV coverage left many of these storylines at a cliffhanger and consequently All Star underwent a box office boom as hardcore fans turned up to live shows to see what happened next, and kept coming for several years due to careful use of show-to-show storylines. Headline matches frequently pitted Nagasaki in violent heel vs heel battles against the likes of Rocco, Dave 'Fit' Finlay, Skull Murphy and even Giant Haystacks.\nAll Star's post-television boom wore off after 1993 when Nagasaki retired for a second time. However, the promotion kept afloat on live shows at certain established venues and particularly on the holiday camp circuit. Since the mid-1990s, the promotion has mainly been focussed on family entertainment. After the demise of Joint/RWS, All Star's chief rival on the live circuit was Scott Conway's TWA (The Wrestling Alliance) promotion, founded as the Southeastern Wrestling Alliance in 1989. By the late 1990s, many smaller British promoters were increasingly abandoning their British identity in favour of \"WWF Tribute\" shows, with British performers crudely imitating World Wrestling Federation stars.\n\nAlthough All Star never descended into a full-fledged 'tribute show', by the turn of the millennium, many of these tribute acts such as the \"UK Undertaker\" and \"Big Red Machine\" were nonetheless headlining All Star shows. Disaffected with this and other matters (such as the inclusion of former WWF World Champion Yokozuna on advertising posters over a year after he had died, the continued advertising of Davey Boy Smith months after his planned tour fell through and the use of a photo of the original WWF Kane to depict the tribute performer \"Big Red Machine\"), Conway cut his links with All Star and declared a promotional war. He began to promote his TWA as an alternative, featuring more serious wrestling (in much the same way as All Star had previously targeted Joint fans disaffected with Big Daddy). All Star duly adapted to meet the challenge, recruiting a new generation of wrestlers such as Dean Allmark and Robbie Dynamite and signing up such stars as \"American Dragon\" Bryan Danielson. The promotional war came to an abrupt end in 2003 when Conway relocated to Thailand, closing down the TWA (which he briefly tried to transplant to his new country as the \"Thai Wrestling Alliance\").\n\nIn recent times, All Star has reached new heights of activity not seen since the post-television boom of the early 1990s, reactivating many more old TV venues, and in the summer 2008 season revived the old tradition of wrestling shows at Blackpool Tower, with a Friday night residency there. All Star has re-established old links with promoters in France, Germany, Japan and Calgary. All Star wrestlers have been widely used to represent Britain by major American promoters, for example the Team UK in TNA's 2004 X Cup which featured four All Star Wrestling regulars James Mason, Dean Allmark, Robbie Dynamite and Frankie Sloan. Mason would also guest on \"WWE Smackdown\" in 2008, defeating MVP.\n\nThe promotion also runs a wrestling school in Birkenhead, Merseyside, with Allmark and Dynamite as chief trainers. Dixon and Mueller's daughter Laetitia, a popular ring announcer for the promotion, is married to Allmark and the couple have one son, Joseph, the first grandchild of Dixon and Mueller.\n\nIn April 2014, ASW established a relationship with Japanese promotion Wrestle-1.\n\nThe Mountevans committee was an independent committee which met in 1947 to establish a set of rules and championships for the British professional wrestling scene. Four of the six current titles listed above were set up by the committee. All Star Wrestling hosted many other such championships in the past, some of which have since been moved to or revived by other promotions.\n\n\"(The below list of various championships previously featured on All Star shows but not recognised under the UK's Mountevans Committee rules include company-only championships as well as titles from American promotions defended by visiting champions. As with the previous list, some of these remained active outside of All Star)\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2180824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180824", "title": "Austen submachine gun", "text": "Austen submachine gun\n\nThe Austen (from \"Australian Sten\") was a 9×19mm Australian submachine gun derived from the British Sten gun developed during the Second World War. In total 19,914 Austens were produced during the war by Diecasters Ltd of Melbourne and W. T. Carmichael Ltd of Sydney.\n\nWith the war in Europe demanding most of the available material for the British, Australia was not in a position to purchase weapons from the United Kingdom or the United States, and so they had to develop their own submachine guns. The British Sten submachine gun was taken as the basis for the Austen. The barrel, body (receiver) and trigger mechanism of the Mark II Sten were copied, while the folding stock and bolt, with separate firing pin and telescopic cover over the return spring, were copied from the German MP40. The folding stock also included a screwdriver and a cleaning rod which both unscrewed from the tubes of the stock. The weapon also featured twin pistol-style grips; the latter containing a small spare parts container inside. The weapon had a selective-fire feature permitting the firer to fire single shots or fully automatic at 500 rounds per minute.\n\nAn interesting production feature of the Austen was that some parts were manufactured by the diecasting process. These parts were the magazine housing, part of the mechanism for the stock and the forward half of the magazine. The magazine loader was also diecast. The two firms manufacturing the Austen were specialist diecasting companies.\n\nThere was a suppressed version made for use by Z Special Force.\n\nAn improved version, the Mark II Austen, was introduced but was not ready until 1946, after the end of the Second World War. This model made even more extensive use of diecasting; the large grip assemblies at both the front and back of the gun were produced in this way. 200 examples were built, and these were both adopted and declared obsolete in August 1946.\n\nThe Austen never achieved the level of popularity that the Owen gun achieved. This was largely because the Owen was a very reliable weapon and although the Austen was an improvement on the basic Sten, it was never able to achieve the Owen's reliability. Additionally, it has been asserted that the Owen was much more suited to jungle warfare. No doubt the Austen's side-mounted magazine and bolt proved a hindrance to soldiers in the jungle, as this aspect necessarily meant that the working parts were more exposed to dirt and therefore prone to fouling due to the cocking slot's position on the right-hand side of the body.\n\nRegarded as obsolete by 1945, the Austen was rarely used in subsequent decades. In contrast, the Owen was widely used by the Australian Army until the 1960s.\n\n"}

Knopf from a screenplay by Helen Deutsch. The music score is by Bronislau Kaper, the cinematography by Arthur E. Arling, the art direction by Daniel B. Cathcart and Cedric Gibbons and costume design by Walter Plunkett and Helen Rose.\n\nThe film stars Leslie Caron as Cinderella, and Michael Wilding as the Prince, with Keenan Wynn, Estelle Winwood, Elsa Lanchester, Barry Jones, Lurene Tuttle, Liliane Montevecchi and Walter Pidgeon as Narrator.\n\nThe film received its network television premiere divided into two episodes on the 1967 ABC-TV anthology series \"Off To See The Wizard\".\n\nElla is a lonely and misunderstood young woman who lives in a European duchy who has become a lowly servant to her stepmother, the Widow Sonder, and stepsisters, Birdena and Serafina. She is shunned by the townspeople because of her anti-social behavior and nicknamed \"Cinderella\". In the face of ridicule, Ella boasts that she will live in the palace one day (as a fortune-teller once told her late mother).\n\nPrince Charles, son of the Duke who rules the principality, has been studying abroad for years; his return being celebrated by three days of festivities and a ball on the final day. He starts to recall old memories he had of growing up there, including a small girl with unbearably sad eyes whom he saw when he was just a boy.\n\nAfter getting into a spat with her stepfamily, Ella runs away to her favorite place, a small secluded pool on the Palace grounds. There she meets the eccentric town vagrant Mrs. Toquet who becomes her first friend.\n\nThe next day she returns to the spot, hoping to meet Mrs. Toquet, but instead finds Charles and his friend Kovin. Ella asks them where they are from and they tell her that they come from the Palace and that Charles is the son of the Chief Cook. Charles then recognizes Ella's eyes as those belonging to the girl he saw years ago. Ella thinks that he is making fun of her and pushes him into the pool. \n\nThe Sonder home is visited by their wealthy Cousin Loulou. Ella is supposed to be cleaned up to receive their guest, but her stepfamily is scandalized when they discover that she is barefoot. Ella remembers that she left her shoes at the pond and runs off to collect them, where she finds Charles waiting for her. Ella apologizes for pushing him into the water and he apologizes for hurting her feelings. Charles gives her an invitation to the Ball and a quick dancing lesson. After a waltz Charles steals a kiss and Ella runs away.\n\nAfter the Widow Sonder, Birdena, and Serafina leave for the ball, Mrs. Toquet arrives, bringing a pair of glass slippers and one of Cousin Loulou's fancy ballgowns, claiming she has \"borrowed\" it for Ella's use. She has also arranged for a coach to take Ella to the palace and warns her to leave by midnight so as not to inconvenience the coachman's other clients.\n\nAt the Ball, Ella is besieged by young men wanting to dance with her, but she refuses to speak to anyone, trying to reach the Palace kitchens to find Charles. Charles learns of her presence and waltzes with her, revealing his true identity. The other guests note the unknown newcomer's exotic appearance and surmise (because of her short hair) that she is an Egyptian princess. As the clock strikes midnight, Ella runs off to escape her suspicious stepfamily, leaving one of her glass slippers behind, which is then picked up by Charles. While fleeing the palace, Ella's coach overturns and she is knocked unconscious; lying next to her on the ground are a pumpkin and several mice. Ella wakes up back home and is greeted by Mrs. Toquet, who informs Ella that everything she borrowed is back where it belongs. \n\nPrince Charles informs his father that he has met the woman he wants to marry. Kovin, picking up on what he's overheard at the ball, hurriedly \"explains\" that Ella is an Egyptian princess. By the next morning, everyone has heard that the Prince has chosen an Egyptian Princess to be his bride. When Ella hears this news, she is devastated and decides to run away, first stopping at her favorite place to see Mrs. Toquet, to whom she bids farewell. Ella throws herself on the ground sobbing, until she looks up and sees the Prince, holding her lost glass slipper, which he declares will fit the foot of the princess he intends to marry. A crowd of gatherers, including Ella's stepmother and stepsisters, bow to Ella as she and the Prince ride off to the palace together. Mrs. Toquet, revealed to be Ella's fairy godmother, vanishes, returning to where she came from.\n\n\nEleanor and Herbert Farjeon had written a 1944 play about Cinderella, \"The Glass Slipper\". MGM bought the film rights in 1953 as a vehicle for Leslie Caron.\n\nCaron had just had a big hit at the studio in \"Lili\" so MGM reunited her with that film's producer and director for \"Glass Slipper\". Anatole de Grunwald was assigned to write the script. However eventually script duties went to Helen Deutsch, who wrote \"Lilli\".\n\nThe Farjeons are not credited on the final film. Deutsch claimed her script was basically an original work:\nMGM gave me one word, 'Cinderella'. That's how it started. I read practically everything written about this famous waif, rejection most conceptions of the character. Actually my Cinderella of the 18th century is not based definitely on anyone's ideas but my own. Waifs have intrigued the reading public for generations; they were popular characters in the early movies - the Gish era - then gave way to more worldly females. I first revived the waif successfully in \"Lili\". \n\"Lili\" had a hit song \"Hi Lili Hi Lo\", lyrics by Helen Deutsch; the same team wrote one for \"Glass Slipper\", \"Take My Love\". Deutsch also wrote the libretto for the ballet scenes.\n\nThe male lead was given to Michael Wilding, who was then married to MGM contract star Elizabeth Taylor and was under contract to the studio himself.\n\nTaina Elg was to have made her dramatic debut in the film but in the end MGM decided to only use her as a dancer. Eventually it was decided that Elg would debut in \"The Prodigal\" and not appear in \"Glass Slipper\" at all. She was replaced by Liliane Montevecchi. The Ballet de Paris appeared in some scenes.\n\nKeenan Wynn was withdrawn from \"Deep in My Heart\" to appear in the film.\n\nThe score was composed by Bronislau Kaper and conducted by Miklós Rózsa, with orchestrations by Robert Franklyn. Additional recording sessions were conducted by Johnny Green. Helen Deutsch wrote lyrics for the song \"Take My Love\" to music by Kaper. Vocals for actor Michael Wilding were performed by Gilbert Russell.\n\nThe complete score, including alternate versions of the three ballets by Kaper, was released in 2005 on compact disc on the Film Score Monthly label.\n\nThe choreography was by Roland Petit.\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $1,363,000 in the US and Canada and $1,589,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $387,000.\n\n\n"}

Success finally comes at the expense of the suicide of another female singer at the club (named Rosa), but then Yorgos is exiled for political reasons, and she and Babis leave for other venues. Although Marika carries a torch for Babis, their relationship never seems to work out, and after many years and World War II go by, she sends her daughter away to a convent school (to later become a dancer in a cabaret, much to Marika's chagrin) and goes on a tour in America. She then returns to Greece to find herself supplanted by a younger singer named Matina who has caught the attention of Babis. Near the end of the movie, she is stabbed in the stomach the night of her reunion concert. Marika dies of her wounds and is buried by the people she sang with as they sing in her memory at the cemetery.\n\nThere have been hypotheses that the story is based on the life of Marika Ninou with Babis playing the part of Vasilis Tsitsanis. However, there are glaring differences between the film and the real life of Marika Ninou.\n\nMarika Ninou only began singing after World War II. While she went to America, she never went with Vasilis Tsitsanis but in fact went with Kostas Kaplanis. She then returned to Greece and died of cancer. The film mentions a conflict with a singer named Rosa (Roza Eskenazi?) but no such incident has ever been documented.\n\n\"Rembetiko\" was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival in 1984, and won the Silver Bear. Sotiria Leonardou won the prize for \"Best Actress\" at the 1983 Thessaloniki Film Festival for her portrayal of Ninou and the film itself tied for \"Best Picture\", and won three other awards as well (two \"Best Supporting Actor\" prizes, and one for music).\n\n"}

He is best known as the co-creator of Robin and the Joker and for his work on behalf of creators' rights.\n\nHe was inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nJerry Robinson was born in Trenton, New Jersey, the son of Mae and Benjamin Robinson. He was of Russian Jewish descent. He attended Columbia University, but did not graduate.\n\nRobinson was a 17-year-old journalism student at Columbia University in 1939 when he was discovered by Batman creator Bob Kane, who hired him to work on that fledgling comic as an inker and letterer. Kane, with writer Bill Finger, had shortly before created the character Batman for National Comics, the future DC Comics. Robinson rented a room from a family in The Bronx near Kane's family's Grand Concourse apartment, where Kane used his bedroom as an art studio. He started as a letterer and a background inker, shortly graduating to inking secondary figures. Within a year, he became Batman's primary inker, with George Roussos inking backgrounds. Batman quickly became a hit character, and Kane rented space for Robinson and Roussos in Times Square's Times Tower. In addition to Batman, Robinson and Roussos did inks and backgrounds on \"Target and the Targeteers\" for Novelty Press. Roussos recounted of his collaboration with Robinson:\n\nIt was hard to make the deadlines, because Jerry was a heavy sleeper. I used to have to go to the Bronx to get him to come to work. I'd go and wake him up 2 o'clock in the afternoon so we could work all night. ... We were committed to do about 13 pages a week. Jerry was always behind - he was always whiting out things and re-inking them. Bob's stuff was so sketchy, Jerry had to do a lot of work.\n\nApproximately a year and a half after Robinson, Roussos, and Finger were hired by Kane, National Comics lured them away, making them company staffers. Roussos has claimed that their work on \"Target and the Targeteers\" made the series look \"almost identical to Kane's Batman\", and National hired them as staffers because they saw that it had become a significant competition for Batman. Robinson recalled working in the bullpen at the company's 480 Lexington Avenue office, alongside \"Superman\" creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, as well as Jack Kirby, Fred Ray, and Mort Meskin, \"one of my best friends, who[m] I brought up from MLJ\".\n\nBy early 1940, Kane and Finger discussed adding a sidekick. Robinson suggested the name \"Robin\" after Robin Hood books he had read during boyhood, saying (in a 2005 interview) that he was inspired by one book's N.C. Wyeth illustrations. The new character, orphaned circus performer Dick Grayson, came to live with Bruce Wayne (Batman) as his young ward in \"Detective Comics\" #38 (April 1940). Robin would inspire many similar sidekicks throughout the remainder of the Golden Age of Comic Books.\nBatman's nemesis, the Joker, was introduced around the same time, in \"Batman\" #1 (Spring 1940). Though Kane claimed he and writer Bill Finger came up with the idea for the Joker, most comic historians credit Robinson for the iconic villain, modeled after Conrad Veidt in the 1928 film, \"The Man Who Laughs\". Credit for that character's creation, however, is disputed. Robinson has said he created the character. Kane's position was that:\n\nRobinson, whose original Joker playing card was on public display in the exhibition \"Masters of American Comics\" at the Jewish Museum in New York City, New York, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007, and the William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta, Georgia from October 24, 2004 to August 28, 2005, has countered that:\n\nFinger provided his own account in 1966:\n\nRobinson was also a key force in the creation of Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, and the villain Two-Face.\n\nIn 1943, when Kane left the Batman comic books to focus on penciling the daily \"Batman\" newspaper comic strip, Robinson took over the full penciling, along with others such as Dick Sprang. Only Kane's name appeared on the strip.\n\nFrom 1944 to 1946, Robinson and his friend Meskin formed a studio which produced material for the short-lived Spark Publications. Robinson worked on numerous other characters for several publishers, at one point doing freelance illustrations for a textbook publisher. After leaving superhero comics, he became a newspaper cartoonist and created \"True Classroom Flubs and Fluffs\", which ran during the 1960s in the \"New York Sunday News\" (later incorporated into the \"Daily News\"). Robinson also did a political satire cartoon panel feature, \"Still Life\" which began national syndication on June 3, 1963.\nRobinson never saw himself only as a comic-book artist. In the 1950s, he started drawing cover illustrations for \"Playbill\" and tried his hand at political sketches, producing what he considered his best work: \"I did 32 years of political cartoons, one every day for six days a week. That body of work is the one I'm proudest of. While my time on Batman was important and exciting and notable considering the characters that came out of it, it was really just the start of my life.\"\n\nRobinson was president of the National Cartoonists Society from 1967 to 1969 and served a two-year term as president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists starting in 1973.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, Robinson was a crucial supporter of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in their long struggle with DC Comics to win full recognition and compensation as the creators of Superman. With comics artist and rights advocate Neal Adams, Robinson organized key support around Siegel and Shuster, to whom DC, in December 1975, granted lifetime stipends and a credit in all broadcast and published Superman works. In 1978, he founded CartoonArts International, which as of 2010 has more than 550 artists from over 75 countries.\n\nDuring 1999, Robinson created an original manga series, \"Astra\", with the help of manga artist Shojin Tanaka and Ken-ichi Oishi. This was later on released in English through Central Park Media by their manga line CPM Manga as a comic book miniseries and then a trade paperback.\n\nOn May 26, 2007, DC Comics announced that Robinson had been hired by the company as a \"creative consultant\". The press release accompanying this announcement did not describe his duties or responsibilities.\n\nRobinson was among the interview subjects in \"Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle\", a three-hour documentary narrated by Liev Schreiber that premiered posthumously on PBS in October 2013.\n\nRobinson died in his sleep at age 89 on the afternoon of December 7, 2011 in Staten Island. His survivors were his wife, Gro (née Bagn) and two children.\n\nIn 1974, Robinson wrote \"The Comics\", a comprehensive study of the history of newspaper comic strips.\n\nRobinson won the National Cartoonists Society Award for the Comic Book Division in 1956, their 1963 Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for \"Still Life\", their 1965 Special Features Award for \"Flubs and Fluffs\" and their Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. Robinson was inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2004. Robinson received the Sparky Award for lifetime achievement from the Cartoon Art Museum at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International.\n\n\n"}

Initially greeted with scorn by critics and newspaper editors in the city of its gaze (The \"Chicago Daily News\" famously called it a \"Case for Ra(n)t Control\"), it is now widely regarded by scholars as the definitive prose portrait of the city of Chicago, although it has never rivaled the literary status of Carl Sandburg's 1916 poem \"Chicago\". Algren leans heavily on the imagery and themes developed by Sandburg, to whom Algren dedicated the book. Curiously, he also quietly leans upon a poem about New York called \"The City\" by Ben Maddow, from whom Algren lifted powerful images of urban life. Subsequent portraits of Chicago, such as Studs Terkel's 1985 \"Chicago\", have likewise leaned heavily upon Algren's work.\n\nIn the 12,000-word lyrical essay, Algren summarizes 120 years of Chicago history as a tangle of hustlers, gangsters, and corrupt politicians, but he ultimately declares his love for the city with these famous lines from Chapter 2: \"It's every man for himself in this hired air. / Yet once you've come to be part of this particular patch, you'll never love another. Like loving a woman with a broken nose, you may well find lovelier lovelies. But never a lovely so real.\" Algren locates the city's heart in the \"nobodies nobody knows,\" the ginsoaks, stew bums, and shell-shocked veterans who lurk in the alleys and linger in the weedy wastes underneath the 'L' tracks. Unrivaled in its depiction of Chicago's downtrodden, the essay recounts the repeated ways Chicago sells out its dreams and disappoints its dreamers, including the 1919 Black Sox scandal, in which eight Chicago White Sox players were accused of accepting bribes to throw the world series. Indeed, Algren writes, the whole city has always been \"a rigged ball game.\"\n\nThe University of Chicago Press issued a new edition of the essay upon its 50th anniversary in 2001, and it remains one of Chicago's most popular local books. Nostalgia for Chicago's colorful history may explain the essay's continued success. In a 2002 reassessment of the essay, University of Chicago scholar Jeff McMahon wrote, \"Why does Algren's textual Chicago continue to resonate with Chicago readers today? In sentences that assess Algren's legacy as a Chicago writer — sentences in which Algren serves as subject, Chicago as object — one verb often recurs. As Mike Royko writes in 'Algren's Golden Pen,' Algren \"captures\" Chicago. From the discourse on this essay emerges the argument that the text contains some captured aspect of Chicago that still applies to the city today.\"\n\n\n"}

It began broadcasting on October 16, 1962. It was the network's only station in West Texas until 1978, when KCOS was established in El Paso. KCOS and KTTZ would remain the only PBS member stations in the West Texas region north of I-20 until KPBT-TV was established in Odessa in 1986, followed by KACV-TV in Amarillo in 1988.\n\nThe station's former analog channel 5 was added to the FCC table of allotments in 1952 as a commercial channel. Plains Broadcasting Company received a construction permit for channel 5 in 1953. The station planned to locate on then-rural land at 74th Street and College Avenue (now University Avenue). That site is today used for KLBK-TV (channel 13) and virtual sister station KAMC (channel 28).\n\nKTXT-TV signed on from a converted building (the former Agriculture Pavilion) and a tower located at the new studios. The station installed a six-bay RCA antenna, used dual 1-5/8\" feed lines, and a 500 watt RCA TT-500BL transmitter for an ERP of about 2,500 watts visual. In 1966, a grant bought the station a TT-6EL transmitter which raised power to 25,700 watts. In 1982–83 the station received a donated tower (former KAMR-TV Amarillo tower) and 12 bay antenna. This allowed the station to raise power to 60,600 watts visual. A Harris transmitter was installed in 1984 and the station converted to BTSC (stereo TV audio) operation.\n\nKTXT has broadcast solely digitally since 4:30 p.m. on February 5, 2009.

The abbot of the monastery of La Case Dieu and the count of Pardiac had invited Guichard de Marciac with the hope he would ensure a safe place for Marciac's citizens and guarantee the prosperity of the city for years to come.\n\nA great emphasis is placed on jazz in the town, which is taught as a regular subject in local schools. The town itself is known for its annual Jazz in Marciac festival, held for a fortnight in August. A marquee (\"le chapiteau\") capable of seating 6,000 is erected on the rugby field, with concerts hosted there every night for the duration of the festival, and free music from 11:00 till 20:00 every day.

{"id": "2180852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180852", "title": "Nobel Foundation", "text": "Nobel Foundation\n\nThe Nobel Foundation () is a private institution founded on 29 June 1900 to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The Foundation is based on the last will of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite.\n\nIt also holds Nobel Symposia on important breakthroughs in science and topics of cultural or social significance.\n\n, born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm Sweden, was a chemist, engineer, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the inventor of dynamite. He owned Bofors, a major armaments manufacturer, which he had redirected from its original business as an iron and steel mill. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. Nobel amassed a sizeable personal fortune during his lifetime, thanks mostly to this invention. In 1896 Nobel died of a stroke in his villa in San Remo, Italy where he had lived out the last years of his life.\n\nNobel's will expressed a request, to the surprise of many, that his money be used for prizes in physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine and literature. Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died, and signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895. Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million Swedish \"kronor\", to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes. (As of 2008 that equates to 186 million US dollars.)\n\nThe executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organize the prizes. Although Nobel's will established the prizes, his plan was incomplete and, because of various other hurdles, it took five years before the Nobel Foundation could be established and the first prizes could be awarded on 10 December 1901 to, among others, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. As of 31 December 2015, the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 4.065 billion Swedish \"kronor\" (approx. US$443 million as of 12 December 2016).\n\nThe Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organisation on 29 June 1900 specifically to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. It is based on Nobel's last will and testament. At the time Nobel's will led to much skepticism and criticism and thus it was not until 26 April 1897 that his will was approved by the Storting. Soon thereafter they appointed the members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that was to award the Peace Prize. Shortly after, the other prize-awarding organizations followed; Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June. The next thing the Nobel Foundation did was to try to agree on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900 the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.\n\nIn 1905 the Union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved which meant the responsibility for awarding Nobel Prizes was split between the two countries. Norway's Nobel Committee became the awarder of the Peace Prize while Sweden became the awarder of the other prizes.\n\nIn accordance with Nobel's will, the primary task of the Nobel Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left after him in a fund. Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to represent the Nobel Prize to the outside world and to take charge of informal activities and issues related to the awarding of the Nobel Prizes. The Nobel Foundation is not involved in any way in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates. In many ways the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company in that it invests money in various ways to create a solid funding base for the prize and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953). Since the 1980s the Foundation's investments began to earn more money than previously. At the beginning of the 1980s the award money was 1 million SEK but in 2008 the award money had increased to 10 million SEK.\n\nAccording to the statutes the Foundation should consist of a Board with its seat in Stockholm. It should consist of five men. The Chairman of the board should be appointed by the King in Council. The other four members should be appointed by the trustees of the prize awarding institutions. The Board's first task was to choose an executive director from among the board members. A deputy director should be appointed by the King in Council and two deputies for the other members were appointed by the Trustees. However, since 1995 all the members of the board have been chosen by the Trustees and the Executive Director and the deputy Director appointed by the board itself.\n\nApart from the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up by the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly, the Swedish Academy and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions and auditors.\n\nIn 1965, the Foundation initiated the Nobel Symposia, a program that holds symposia \"devoted to areas of science where breakthroughs around the world are occurring or deal with other topics of primary cultural or social significance.\" The symposia has covered topics such as prostaglandins, chemical kinetics, diabetes mellitus, string theory, cosmology, and the Cold War in the 1980s. The Nobel Symposium Committee consists of members from the Nobel Committees in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine; the Prize Committee for Economics; the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation; and the Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nIn 2007, the Nobel Charitable Trust, founded by Michael Nobel, Gustaf Nobel, Peter Nobel, and Philip Nobel, announced their plans to establish a new Nobel prize, the Michael Nobel Energy Award, that will award innovations in alternative energy technology. It will be the first new Nobel prize established by the Nobel family since Alfred Nobel established his prizes. However, it will be awarded by the Nobel Charitable Trust and not by the Nobel Foundation, although both are organisations founded by the Nobel family.\n\nThe plan was announced at nanoTX 07. The Nobel Foundation quickly reacted by threatening legal action for \"clear misuse of the reputation and goodwill of the Nobel Prize and the associations of integrity and eminence that has been created over time and through the efforts of the Nobel Committees\". The Director, Michael Sohlman, of the Nobel Foundation and the elected head of the Nobel family disapproved to the institution of the so-called 'Dr. Michael Nobel Award' as well as the Nobel Charitable Trust (NCT) and Nobel Family Benevolent society.\n\n\n"}

The paper, whose staff numbered five, including its founder Gebran Tueni, was started with a capital of 50 gold pieces raised from friends, and a circulation of a mere 500 copies. Tueni served as the chief editor of the paper until his death in 1949. His son, Ghassan Tueni, and grandson, also named Gebran Tueni, were subsequent editors and publishers.\n\nGhassan Tueni was publisher and editor-in-chief of the paper from 1948 to 1999 when he retired. On 19 December 1976, Syrian forces occupied the offices of the daily. Upon this incident Ghassan Tueni suspended the publication for a while and left Lebanon for Paris. In 1977, several journalists writing for the daily were detained.\n\nGhassan's son, Gebran Tueni, was the editor-in-chief of the paper from 2003 to 2005. He was elected to parliament for a Beirut constituency in the 2005 elections, but was assassinated on 12 December 2005 in Mkalles near Beirut in a car bomb explosion. A fiery critic of Syria and its hegemony in Lebanese affairs, Gebran had just returned on the eve of his assassination from Paris where he had been living for fear of assassination. After Gebran's assassination on 12 December 2005, his father Ghassan took over the paper again until his death on 8 June 2012.\n\nSaudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal has a stake in the paper. The 2009 Ipsos Stat survey revealed that the paper is the most popular newspaper in Lebanon and one of the five most popular in the Middle East.\n\n\"An-Nahar\" is the first Arab paper which regularly covers news on environmental issues. Since 1997, the daily contains a daily page for the environment.\n\n\"An-Nahar\" provided a platform for various freethinkers to express their views during the years of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. The paper can be best expressed as centre-left, though its writers' views range across the political spectrum.\n\nJournalist Charles Glass argues that \"An-Nahar\" is Lebanon's equivalent of \"The New York Times\".\n\nAnother Lebanese daily, \"As-Safir\", is cited as the rival of \"An-Nahar\". In the mid-1990s the latter was described as a moderate and right-of-center paper, while the former as a left-of-center paper. In the 2000s these papers were again supporters of two opposite poles in Lebanon, in that \"An-Nahar\" is a supporter of March 14 alliance, whereas \"As-Safir\" supported March 8 alliance.\n\nProminent writers for \"An-Nahar\" have included novelist and critic Elias Khoury, who used to edit its weekly cultural supplement \"Al Mulhaq\" (which appears on Saturdays) and, until his assassination, historian, journalist and political activist Samir Kassir. Walid Jumblatt worked as a reporter at the daily in the 1980s. Leading caricaturist Pierre Sadek also worked for the daily.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the paper had the highest circulation in Lebanon. However, its circulation in the beginning of the 2000s was 45,000 copies, making it the second after \"As-Safir\". In 2012, the Lebanese Ministry of Information stated that \"An-Nahar\" has a circulation of 45,000 copies.\n\nThe paper's online version was the 13th most visited website for 2010 in the MENA region.\n\nIn addition to its native readers in Lebanon, the daily is read by officials, intellectuals and activists outside Lebanon.\n\nThe paper was closed for ten days on 3 May 1961 due to the publication of a cartoon depicting Lebanon as a province of Syria. Syria banned mass circulation of the daily in 2005, while its online edition was not banned. In March 2006, the Damascus correspondent of \"An-Nahar\" was charged in Syria with publishing \"false information harmful to national security\" after writing about the intelligence services of the country.\n"}

They were staunchly Pagan and dedicated to the worship of such deities as Odin and Thor. They reputedly would fight for any lord able to pay their substantial fees and occasionally fought alongside Christian rulers. Although they were Pagan, the institutions of the Jomsvikings in some ways foreshadowed those of the Christian Knightly Orders of the later Middle Ages.\n\nThe legend of the Jomsvikings appears in some of the Icelandic sagas from the 12th and 13th centuries. According to the sagas (particularly the \"Jómsvíkinga saga\", \"King Olaf Tryggvasson’s Saga\", and stories found in the Flatey Book), their stronghold Jomsborg was located on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, but the exact location is disputed by modern historians and archeologists. Most scholars locate it on the hill Silberberg, north of the town of Wolin on Wolin island in modern day Poland. Jomsborg is thought by some researchers to be identical with Jumne, Julin and Vineta, which are mentioned in both Danish and German records from the Middle Ages.\n\nHistorians still debate the accuracy of the accounts of the Jomsvikings. Since the site of their headquarters has never been conclusively located, confirming the tales of their exploits is somewhat difficult. The location of Jomsborg is a matter of debate in historical circles, due to the scarcity of primary sources. There are no contemporary sources mentioning the names \"Jomsvikings\" and \"Jomsborg\", but there are three contemporary runestones. Reference also appears in Old Norse poetry and Lausavísur which refer to their battles.\n\nThe \"Saga of the Jomsvikings\" relates that the Jomsvikings were highly selective in deciding whom to admit to their order. Membership was restricted to men of proven valor between 18 and 50 (with the exception of a boy named Vagn Åkesson, who defeated Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson in single combat at the age of 12). In order to gain admission, prospective members were required to prove themselves with a feat of strength, often taking the form of a ritual duel, or \"holmgang\", with a Jomsviking.\n\nOnce admitted, the Jomsvikings required adherence to a strict code of conduct in order to instill a sense of military discipline among its members. Any violation of these rules could be punished with immediate expulsion from the order. Each Jomsviking was bound to defend his brothers, as well as to avenge their deaths if necessary. He was forbidden to speak ill of his fellows or to quarrel with them. Blood feuds between members were to be mediated by Jomsviking officers. Jomsvikings were forbidden to show fear or to flee in the face of an enemy of equal or inferior strength, though orderly retreat in the face of vastly outnumbering forces appears to have been acceptable. All spoils of battle were to be equally distributed among the entire brotherhood. No Jomsviking was permitted to be absent from Jomsborg for more than three days without the permission of the brotherhood. No women or children were allowed within the fortress walls, and none were to be taken captive. It is unclear, however, whether members were forbidden marriage or liaisons with women outside the walls.\n\nThere are different accounts for the origins of the order. \"Gesta Danorum\" (book 10) tells that a settlement named Julinum was conquered by the King of Denmark, Harald Bluetooth, who gave it to the Swedish prince Styrbjörn the Strong. Harald then provided Styrbjörn with a strong force with which Styrbjörn terrorized the seas. The \"Knýtlinga saga\" agrees by giving Harald as the founder of the Jomsvikings, but the story of Styrbjörn is not connected to the Jomsvikings. The \"Jómsvíkinga saga\" says that the settlement was founded by Palnatoke, receiving the location from the mythical Wendish ruler Burislav. \"Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa\" and \"Eyrbyggja saga\" agree with all previously mentioned versions by making Styrbjörn take command of the Jomsvikings after they already had been established. \"Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa\" also tells that among the Norse there were many men from the \"East land\" arriving at Jomsborg, suggesting that it was a settlement of mixed ethnicity. Jomsviking chieftains included Palnatok, Styrbjörn the Strong, Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson, Thorkell the High, and Hemeng.\nAccounts of their size vary. In various sources, Jomsborg was supposed to have held anywhere from 30 to 300 ships in its harbor. However some historians believe Jomsborg was largely a market center with its Danish garrison imposed on the Wends.\n\n\"Gesta Danorum\" (book 10), \"Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa\" and \"Eyrbyggja saga\" relate that in the early 980s, the exiled Swedish prince Styrbjörn the Strong brought the Jomsvikings to a devastating defeat against Styrbjörn's uncle King Eric the Victorious at the Battle of the Fýrisvellir, Uppsala, in 984 or 985, while trying to take the crown of Sweden by force of arms. The fact that the Jomsvikings lost was attributed to a pact which the Swedish king Eric made with Odin. Three runestones from this time, the Högby Runestone (\"the brave champion Asmund fell on the Fyrisvellir\"), one of the Hällestad Runestones, labelled DR 295 (\"he did not flee at Uppsala\"), and the Sjörup Runestone (\"He did not flee at Uppsala, but slaughtered as long as he had a weapon\"), relate to deaths with honour at Uppsala, probably three Jomsvikings. The battle is also commemorated, in poetry, by the Icelandic skald Þórvaldr Hjaltason, who took part in the battle on the Swedish side.\n\"Jómsvíkinga saga\" tells that in 986, they attacked Haakon Jarl in Norway and were defeated in the Battle of Hjörungavágr. The saga recounts that Jomsvikings captured by the Norwegians and about to be executed exhibited courage and defiance, some being eventually spared by their captors. The \"Jómsvíkinga saga\" ends with a brief explanation of the battle's aftermath and, in fact, points to this battle as the beginning of the end for the Jomsvikings.\n\nAfter these two decisive defeats, the power of the Jomsvikings waned, but \"Olaf Trygvasson's Saga\" relates that they played a decisive, if treacherous, role in the Battle of Svolder in 1000. At Svolder, a Jomsviking force led by Sigvald Jarl abandoned King Olaf of Norway and joined forces with his enemies to annihilate his fleet. This action may have been intended to fight the Christianization of Scandinavia, which had been forcibly promoted by Olaf. As it happened though, the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard, who won the Norwegian throne when the sea battle ended, was (at least nominally) a Christian. He and his father, King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, are reported to have been baptized in 965. Their decline continued over the next few decades.\n\nAccording to the \"Heimskringla\", King Magnus I of Norway decided to put an end to the Jomsviking threat. As part of consolidating his control of Denmark, he sacked Jomsborg, destroyed the fortress and many of the inhabitants were killed in 1043.\n\nA golden disc bearing the name of Harald Bluetooth and Jomsvikings stronghold seat Jomsborg appeared in Sweden in autumn 2014. The disc, also called the Curmsun Disc, is made of high gold content and has a weight of 25.23 grams. On the obverse there is a Latin inscription and on the reverse there is a Latin cross with four dots surrounded by an octagonal ridge. The inscription reads: \"+ARALD CVRMSVN+REX AD TANER+SCON+JVMN+CIV ALDIN+\" and translates as \"Harald Gormsson king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, town Aldinburg\".\nIt is assumed that the disc was a part of a Viking hoard found in 1840 in the Polish village Wiejkowo near the town of Wolin by Heinrich Boldt, the maternal great-great-grandfather of Hollywood actors and producers Ben Affleck and Casey Affleck.\n\n\n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2180858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180858", "title": "Maroon Bells", "text": "Maroon Bells\n\nThe Maroon Bells are two peaks in the Elk Mountains, Maroon Peak and North Maroon Peak, separated by about half a kilometer (one-third of a mile). The mountains are on the border between Pitkin County and Gunnison County, Colorado, United States, about southwest of Aspen. Both peaks are fourteeners. Maroon Peak, at , is the 27th highest peak in Colorado. North Maroon Peak, at , is the 50th highest (depending on how they are counted). The view of the Maroon Bells to the southwest from the Maroon Creek valley is very heavily photographed. The peaks are located in the Maroon Bells–Snowmass Wilderness of White River National Forest. Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness was one of five areas in Colorado designated as wilderness in the original Wilderness Act of 1964. The Wilderness area surrounds the extremely popular Maroon Bells Scenic Area, which is a major access point for Wilderness travel.\n\nUnlike other mountains in the Rockies that are composed of granite and limestone, the Bells are composed of metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that has hardened into rock over millions of years. Mudstone is weak and fractures readily, giving rise to dangerously loose rock along almost any route. A US Forest Service sign on the access trail warns would-be climbers of \"downsloping, loose, rotten and unstable\" rock that \"kills without warning\". The mudstone is also responsible for the Bells' distinctive maroon color. The Bells got their \"deadly\" reputation in 1965 when eight people died in five separate accidents.\n\nMaroon Lake elevation occupies a basin that was sculpted by Ice-Age glaciers and later dammed by a landslide and rockfall debris from the steep slopes above the valley floor.\n\nThe Maroon Bells are an increasingly popular destination for the day and overnight visitors; around 300,000 people visit the Bells every season. Due to the volume of people, a bus service runs every day from 8am-5pm from mid-June through the first weekend in October. During these times, and with just a few exceptions, personal vehicle access is limited to those with handicap placards or disability license plates. The bus runs from Aspen Highlands to Maroon Lake every 20 minutes. The Maroon Bells scenic area features several hiking trails ranging from short hikes near Maroon Lake to longer overnight backpacking trips into the Maroon-Snowmass Wilderness.\nNot only is the use of trails and other outdoor recreational space growing, the overall population of Colorado is growing as well. It is expected that 100,000 people will move to Colorado each year for the next two decades. By 2050,the population of Colorado is expected to increase from 5.5 million to 8.5 million, and with this population growth recreational tourism will continue to grow. In 2017, 1 in 4 of Colorado's 86 million visitors spent most of their trip in mountain towns and resorts. This rapid growth poses challenges for Forest Services to properly maintain natural areas, and if changes are not made to how the recreational space is utilized, wilderness areas like the Maroon Bells–Snowmass Wilderness trails will feel the impacts of human traffic.\n\nBecause the Maroon Bells area receives such high levels of visitor use, the USFS has established a long-term plan to protect and preserve the scenic area and larger wilderness areas. Solutions include the required use of bear canisters for backcountry campers, management of day and overnight use, leashed dog education and ticketing, reduction of heavy horse use in high use areas, and prohibiting overnight camping and excessive day use at particular sites.\nRecently, the US Forest Service (USFS) has come up with a paid permit plan to aid preservation efforts. The permit system was created to allow visitors to stay overnight while mitigating environmental damage and preserving the highly visited area. A permit is required year-round, and limits campers to stay in the Conundrum Creek Valley area from Silver Dollar Pond to Triangle Pass. Campsite limits range from 2 to 6 people, depending on the campsite location. The USFS limits the number of permits to 2 permits per person per calendar year and the maximum stay from June 1- September 1 is 3 nights; the maximum stay for the rest of the year is 7 nights. The Conundrum Hot Springs alone can attract up to 300 people a night.\nSpecific environmental impacts can occur due to the high number of visitors the Maroon Bells experiences each year. See below for more information. \nThe Maroon Bells Recreation area is surrounded by Maroon Creek, which feeds into Crater Lake and Maroon Lake. These natural freshwater ecosystems fill from snowmelt from the surrounding peaks and precipitation, and are major sources of water for the city of Aspen,CO. According to the study \"Environmental Impacts of Tourism on Lakes\", water pollution can occur through indirect and direct methods. Direct pollution to these natural bodies of water occurs when visitors choose to wade or throw items into these bodies of water, disrupting the fragile biodiversity. An increase in human-traffic,such as the increase in the number of visitors who drive up Maroon Creek Road, is an example of indirect pollution. This constant vehicular traffic releases pollutants such as nitrogen and sulfur dioxide into the water and air. \n\n<br> \nU.S. Forest Service officials were concerned about the high nitrogen compound levels in the waters at the Maroon Bells in 2003. Officials mentioned that the increase in population and recreation in Colorado as well as an increase in the number of vehicles could be a cause of the elevated nitrogen compound levels, as these sources emit pollutants. When precipitation forms over peaks like the Maroon Bells, these pollutants fall back to the Earth's surface and can travel into the river and lakes, harming fish, insects, and plants, particularly because of high levels of nitrogen. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency further supports the relationship between pollutants and their negative impacts on lakes, streams, and rivers.\n\nAnother impact of overcrowding in the Maroon Bells trail erosion due to the overwhelming number of visitors. High-traffic hiking can lead to negative environmental outcomes such as “soil disruption, loss of native plant species, vegetation, introduction of weeds and pathogens.” Maroon Bells offers several trails for day-use as well as overnight use; however, many visitors that see the Maroon Bells will make the trek on popular trails surrounding Maroon and Crater Lake. When hikers stray from these highly trafficked trails, they end up establishing “social trails.” These hiker-created trails are not designed to be sensitive to the fragile ecosystem, and often further hurt the natural beauty of the area by damaging vegetation. A recent project to \"rope off\" sensitive areas to prohibit social trails was implemented in 2018 well.\n\nWith an increase in human traffic on trails and in wilderness areas, human waste has become a serious issue. Areas surrounding Condunrum Hot Springs, the Maroon Bells, and the Maroon-Bells Wilderness area has dealt with visitors not practicing proper human waste disposal. Besides the foul smell, human waste can contaminate local water systems and spread disease. It is necessary to use facilities when available as human waste can contain harmful bacteria that can put populations at risk if exposed to it. For those visitors who go further into the backcountry, taking necessary steps to reduce this contamination is critical. In addition to this report, the book \"Colorado Recreation Guide, Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests\" mentions the importance of if an individual must “go in the woods” to make sure to stay away from vegetation as the acidity in urine can impair plant growth.\nIn an attempt to mitigate some of the human waste concerns, the Forest Service recently implemented a human waste awareness campaign (launched around the same time as the paid permit plan). The awareness campaign included educational information on responsible waste disposal (including how to dig cat holes to dispose human feces) as well as the allocation of free portable toilets, called “wag bags,” for all visitors. The Forest Service announced a decline in improperly disposed human waste since the campaign began; however, it is important to continue these efforts.\n\nNoise pollution is defined as “regular exposure to elevated sound levels that can be adverse in humans and other living organisms”,and can have negative impacts on the environment and wildlife. With an increased number in visitors,noise pollution has become a concern when visiting the Maroon Bells. According to a study done by the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University in 2017, noise can alter communication between wildlife and insects as well as change their behaviors and patterns.This study also found that noise pollution can disrupt organisms that play a role in pollination as these animals can hear and are impacted by the noise.\n\nStudies have shown increased levels of pharmaceutical elements (for example, insect repellant), hormones, and related chemicals in waterways downstream from areas of high backpacker use. Additionally, a 2016 study of water and sediment samples from wilderness areas in Colorado found notable levels of anthropogenic bioactive chemicals, which indicates human sources of contamination. This contamination can become a danger to human health, especially during summer storm season, as water flows into sources that are used for human consumption – both within the wilderness area and in downstream communities such as Aspen, CO – and agriculture.\nCampsites set up by backcountry backpackers can also lead to soil compaction and reduced vegetative cover, especially in wilderness areas. Higher erosion levels can occur in the backcountry if backpacker campsites are not properly set-up and taken down. This can cause an increase in water turbidity and some water quality indicators including a strain of E.Coli; further supporting higher erosion level from degraded soils.\nTime spent in the outdoors, including engaging in activities such as hiking, has been shown to have a positive impact on human health. By being active in the outdoors, people can experience health benefits ranging from increased Vitamin D levels to lower rates of obesity; improvements in mental health, such as reduced levels of depression have also been observed. However, trail overuse and overcrowding can affect these benefits. Indeed, experiential sentiments such as solitude, remoteness, naturalness, and artifactualism are often cited key benefits of time spent in the outdoors. However,overcrowding threatens this positive experience. Some have noted that environmental health and human health are deeply intertwined, and, as such, should be duly protected and sustained.\n\nTrail education and much needed enforcement of regulations established to protect this popular destination can help address these human and environmental impacts. Below are a few key ways that we can protect Maroon Bells going forward. \n\n\n"}

He spent five years with Everton, but made just one appearance, while playing on loan at nine different clubs. Ruddy was signed by Paul Lambert to play for Norwich City in 2010 and, in his first season, was part of the team that finished second in the Championship, gaining promotion to the Premier League.\n\nThe following year, Norwich finished twelfth in the Premier League, and Ruddy was selected by new England manager Roy Hodgson for the squad for Euro 2012. However, on 25 May 2012, he was ruled out after breaking his finger during training. He made his debut in a 2–1 win against Italy in August 2012. He suffered a long term thigh injury in November 2012, but returned to help Norwich to an 11th-place finish at the end of the 2012–13 Premier League season. After 243 appearances for Norwich, he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2017.\n\nBorn in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, Ruddy began his career at Cambridge United and made his professional debut in the final match of the 2003–04 season at Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road stadium on 8 May 2004, keeping a clean sheet and saving a penalty. Ruddy earned his place as Cambridge's first choice keeper in the 2004–05 season, making 38 appearances in a season that saw the U's relegated from league two after finishing bottom with 30 points. This was despite Ruddy's tremendous efforts, which included keeping 9 clean sheets and conceding just 45 goals.\n\nRuddy had a trial at Manchester United in November 2004, before moving to Everton in the summer of 2005 for a fee of around £250,000 that would rise depending on appearances.\n\nRuddy was called into the England Under-19 squad in 2005 after being scouted by England goalkeeping coach Ray Clemence and was touted by his manager David Moyes as a future England goalkeeper.\n\nIn September 2005, Ruddy signed for Walsall on loan, making four appearances in League One before returning to Everton. Loan spells with Rushden & Diamonds and Chester City followed.\n\nRuddy made his first and only appearance for Everton in February 2006 in unusual circumstances. Nine minutes into the match against Blackburn Rovers, Iain Turner was sent off for handling outside the area. Since Turner was substituting for injured first- and second-choice keepers Nigel Martyn and Richard Wright, it meant that Ruddy was the only keeper left who could play. Ruddy went on to keep a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory.\n\nIn September 2006, Ruddy went on loan again. A one-month deal was agreed with Stockport County, which was extended to three months after some impressive performances. He then agreed a one-month loan with Wrexham in February 2007, but failed to establish a place in the team during his time at the Racecourse Ground and the Red Dragons decided against extending the loan beyond the initial month. On 21 April 2007, Ruddy completed an emergency one-week loan to League One club Bristol City, and helped them move closer to promotion, by playing one match – a 3–1 win over Carlisle United, and later joked he would ask if he were eligible for a runners-up medal as City finished second and won promotion. In January 2009, he went out on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season to Crewe Alexandra.\n\nOn 24 July 2009, Ruddy joined Scottish Premier League club Motherwell on a six-month loan deal, to vie with Michael Fraser and Sebastian Kosiorowski for a place in goal. Ruddy kept clean sheets during a 0–0 home draw against Rangers on 12 September 2009 and a 0–0 away draw against Celtic on 17 October 2009. He also saved a Barry Robson penalty in a 3–2 loss to Celtic on 12 December 2009. When the original loan deal expired in January 2010, the Fir Park club decided that they wanted to keep Ruddy for longer and an extension of a month was agreed with Everton. On 27 January 2010, it was announced that both Ruddy and Everton teammate Lukas Jutkiewicz were to extend their stay at the Scottish Premier League club until May 2010. Ruddy finished the Scottish Premier League season with 15 clean sheets from 34 appearances.\n\nOn 5 July 2010, Ruddy signed for Championship club Norwich City for an undisclosed fee, which Ruddy revealed in 2017 to have been £250,000. In 2012, Paul Lambert revealed that on two earlier occasions he had considered signing Ruddy for clubs he'd previously managed: \"It is funny but ... [I] ... went to watch him for Crewe at MK Dons ... but he had an absolute stinker. We also saw him when he was at Stockport and ... I decided against him at that time, but when Fraser went and it was clear we wouldn't be able to get him back again I knew John had had a really good season at Motherwell. There was that clamour to sign Fraser, but with the finances we just couldn't do that. I wanted somebody with the same stature, a big goalkeeper, and John had that.\"\n\nRuddy made his debut for City against Watford in the opening fixture of the 2010–11 season which Norwich lost 3–2 at Carrow Road. He kept his first clean sheet of the season in a 1–0 away win against Scunthorpe United on 14 August 2010, following this up with another clean sheet against Swansea on 21 August 2010 which included a penalty save that atoned for his error that led to it. In Ruddy's first season for Norwich, he played 45 out of the 46 league matches, helping City to the Premier League, keeping a clean sheet during the 1–0 away win against Portsmouth on 2 May 2011 which sealed promotion for the Canaries.\n\nRuddy started the 2011–12 season as the first choice keeper again for Norwich, starting the 1–1 draw at the DW Stadium against Wigan Athletic. He followed this up by making numerous good saves during Norwich's first home premier league match in seven years in a 1–1 draw against Stoke, including a penalty stop against Jon Walters and a save denying Matthew Etherington from a direct free kick. During the next match, he received his only red card of the season in the match against Chelsea after a foul on Ramires that led to a penalty. However, Ruddy's fortunes were reversed during the return fixture against Chelsea on 21 January 2012 when he kept his first clean sheet of the season during a 0–0 draw at Carrow Road, making several impressive stops from Fernando Torres. Ruddy was voted Player's Player of the Season following Norwich's 12th-place finish, this was a testament to Ruddy's performances for a highly attacking Norwich team, leading to suggestions that he should be called up for Roy Hodgson's England Euro 2012 squad. Ruddy's claim for a squad place was only strengthened by his excellent performance during the 2–0 home win against Aston Villa on the final day of the season.\n\nFor the 2012–13 season Ruddy found himself first choice again ahead of Declan Rudd, Jed Steer and new goalie Mark Bunn. Once again, he saved a penalty during Norwich's first home Premier League fixture of the season during a 1–1 draw with Queens Park Rangers, although Bobby Zamora scored the rebound. He kept memorable clean sheets against Arsenal and Manchester United as Norwich won 1–0 on both occasions, both occurring during an outstanding run of form that saw him keep four clean sheets and concede just two goals in six matches. Unfortunately this great run of form came to an end during a 1–1 draw against his former club Everton when he suffered a thigh injury. He later underwent surgery, ruling him out for three months. However, Ruddy's injury later worsened, with the expectation that he would not be fit again until April. Ruddy returned to action on 7 May 2013 in Norwich's 4–0 Premier League win over West Bromwich Albion, which confirmed mathematical safety from relegation. He also played in Norwich's final match of the season on 19 May 2013, a 3–2 away win against Manchester City.\n\nDespite the previous long term injury, Ruddy started the 2013–14 season as Norwich's first choice keeper in the 2–2 draw with Everton at Carrow Road on 17 August 2013. Ruddy had a tough start to the season which included mistake riddled performances against Spurs, Chelsea and Manchester City. However, since the 5–1 away thrashing at Liverpool Ruddy has been in fine form keeping four clean sheets in nine matches, conceding just seven goals. During this spell Ruddy produced some outstanding performances, including the 2–0 away win against West Bromwich Albion on 7 December 2013 where he saved eight shots, including a brilliant tip around the post from a close range Shane Long header.\n\nIn May 2017, it was announced that Ruddy would be released when his contract expired. All the players who were being released were given the option of whether or not they chose to be available for selection in the one remaining match of the season. In the end, Ruddy was the only one of the seven who played in the match, being made team captain for the day (he had previously captained the side for one match in the 2013–14 season when Sébastien Bassong and Russell Martin were both absent) and saw out his time with the club by keeping a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over Queens Park Rangers.\n\nOn 10 July 2017, Ruddy signed a two-year contract with Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers. His signing came days after the club's previous number one Carl Ikeme was diagnosed with acute leukaemia. On 6 April 2018, Ruddy saved an injury time penalty from Gary Madine away at Cardiff City in a 1–0 win, in a victory that took Wolves nine points clear of Cardiff. Ruddy became the team's main goalkeeper and was part of the team that won promotion to the Premier League as champions. He was named in the division's PFA Team of the Year and was awarded the EFL's Golden Glove Award for the most clean sheets with 24.\n\nIn August 2018 he extended his contract with Wolves, signing a deal due to last until summer 2020, despite having fallen behind new addition Rui Patrício as the club's first-choice goalkeeper.\n\nOn 16 May 2012, Ruddy received his first senior international call-up when Roy Hodgson selected him as a member of the England squad for UEFA Euro 2012. However, a broken finger ruled him out of the tournament, and Jack Butland was called up to replace him. Ruddy was called up for the friendly against Italy in Bern, Switzerland, on 10 August 2012, along with Butland and Joe Hart. He came on for Butland at half-time to make his senior England debut, and made some key saves as England won the match 2–1, keeping a clean sheet in his first England appearance after Butland conceded in the first half.\n\nRuddy was not included in Hodgson's World Cup squad, with Joe Hart, Fraser Forster and Ben Foster selected instead.\n\nRuddy married his wife Laura on 2 June 2012. Prior to the Euro 2012 tournament, he jokingly cited breaking his finger as the reason he was able to have his wedding on that date. He is nicknamed \"The Iceman\".\n\nNorwich City\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

{"id": "2180869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180869", "title": "Convention of 1833", "text": "Convention of 1833\n\nThe Convention of 1833 (April 1–13, 1833), a political gathering of settlers in Mexican Texas, was a successor to the Convention of 1832, whose requests had not been addressed by the Mexican government. Despite the political uncertainty resulting from a recently concluded civil war, 56 delegates met in San Felipe de Austin to draft a series of petitions to the Government of Mexico.\n\nThe volatile William H. Wharton presided over the meeting. Although the convention's agenda largely mirrored that of the Convention of 1832, delegates also agreed to pursue independent statehood for the province, which was at the time part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas. Under the guidance of Sam Houston, former governor of the US state of Tennessee, a committee drafted a state constitution to submit to the Mexican Congress. The proposed constitution was largely patterned on US political principles, yet retained several Spanish customs. Delegates also requested customs exemptions and asked that a ban on immigration into Texas be lifted.\n\nSome residents complained that this convention, like its predecessor, was illegal. Nevertheless, Stephen F. Austin journeyed to Mexico City to present the petitions to the government. Frustrated with the lack of progress, in October Austin wrote a letter encouraging Texans to form their own state government. This letter was forwarded to the Mexican government and Austin was imprisoned in early 1834. During his imprisonment, the federal and state legislatures later passed a series of measures to placate the colonists, including the introduction of trial by jury. Austin acknowledged that \"[e]very evil complained of has been remedied.\"\n\nMexico won its independence from Spain in 1821. After the new country's monarchy was overthrown, the Constitution of 1824 established a federalist republic composed of multiple states. Sparsely populated provinces were denied independent statehood and instead merged with neighboring areas. Mexican Texas, which marked the country's eastern border with the United States, was combined with Coahuila to form the new state Coahuila y Tejas. To facilitate government of the large area, the state was subdivided into several departments; all of Texas was included in the Department of Béxar.\n\nTexas was part of the Mexican frontier, and settlers faced frequent raids by native tribes. Bankrupt and unable to provide much military assistance, in 1824 the federal government legalized immigration from the United States and Europe, hoping that an influx of settlers would discourage raiding. As the number of Americans living in Texas increased, Mexican authorities became apprehensive that the United States intended to annex the area, possibly by force. To curb the perceived threat, the Mexican government passed the Law of April 6, 1830, which restricted immigration from the United States into Texas and called for the first enforcement of customs duties. The new laws were unpopular with both native Mexicans in Texas (\"Tejanos\") and recent immigrants (Texians).\n\nIn 1832, General Antonio López de Santa Anna led a revolt against President Anastasio Bustamante's centralist government. Under the pretext that they supported Santa Anna, a small group of Texians armed themselves and overthrew the commander of the garrison that was enforcing the new customs duties. Other settlers followed their example, and within weeks all Mexican soldiers in eastern Texas had been forced to leave.\n\nBuoyed by their military success, Texians organized a political convention to persuade Mexican authorities to weaken the Laws of April 6, 1830. Although the two municipalities with the largest \"Tejano\" populations, San Antonio de Béxar and Victoria, refused to participate, 55 delegates met in October for the Convention of 1832. They adopted a series of resolutions that requested changes in the governance of Texas. The most controversial item was for Texas to become an independent state, separate from Coahuila. After approving the list of resolutions, delegates created a seven-member central committee to convene future meetings.\n\nBefore the list of concerns could be presented to the state and federal governments, Ramón Músquiz, the political chief of the Department of Béxar, ruled that the convention was illegal. The law directed that citizens should protest to their local \"ayuntamiento\" (similar to a city council), which would forward their concerns to the political chief. The political chief could then escalate the concerns to the appropriate governmental authority. Because this process had not been followed, Músquiz annulled the resolutions.\n\nThe previous convention's lack of \"Tejano\" representation fostered a perception that only newcomers to Texas were dissatisfied. The president of the Convention of 1832, Stephen F. Austin, traveled to San Antonio de Béxar to garner support for the changes the convention had requested. Austin found that the \"Tejano\" leaders largely agreed with the result of the convention but opposed the methods by which the resolutions had been proposed. They urged patience; Bustamante was still president and would not look favorably on a petition from settlers who had recently sided with his rival, Santa Anna.\n\nAs a compromise, the \"ayuntamiento\" of San Antonio de Béxar drafted a petition containing similar language to the convention's resolutions. Following legal norms, they submitted this to Músquiz, who forwarded it to the Mexican Congress in early 1833. At this time, the federal and state governments were in flux. Bustamante had resigned the presidency in late December 1832 as part of a treaty to end the civil war. There was no effective state government. The governor of Coahuila y Tejas had died in September 1832, and his replacement, federalist Juan Martín de Veramendi, immediately dissolved the state legislature, which had centralist leanings. Veramendi called elections to seat a new government in early 1833. Due to the political uncertainty, Austin urged that the federal government be given several months to address the petition. If no action was eventually taken, he advised that Texas residents would form their own state government, essentially declaring independence from Coahuila, if not from Mexico.\n\nAustin's timeframe was endorsed by \"Tejano\" leaders, but it did not pacify the Texian settlers. Towards the end of December, the central committee called for a new convention to meet in San Felipe de Austin in April 1833. Elections were scheduled for March. This action disturbed the \"Tejano\" leaders, who saw it as a violation of their agreement with Austin.\n\nCommunities in Texas elected 56 delegates for the new convention. In a departure from the previous election, San Antonio de Béxar also sent delegates, including James Bowie, the son-in-law of Governor Veramendi. Bowie, like many of his fellow delegates, was known as an agitator who wanted immediate change. The majority of the delegates to the previous convention had been more cautious.\n\nThe Convention of 1833 was called to order on April 1, 1833, in San Felipe de Austin. By coincidence, on that day Santa Anna was inaugurated as the new President of Mexico. Delegates elected William H. Wharton, a \"known hothead\", as president of the convention. Wharton had lost his bid to be president of the previous convention. Historian William C. Davis describes Wharton's election as \"a public declaration that while Austin was still respected, his moderate course would no longer be followed\".\n\nOn the first day, several delegates addressed the convention to justify the recent Texian actions. Many argued that the expulsion of most garrisons in the region was not an act of disloyalty to Mexico, but instead resistance to a particular form of governance. Sam Houston, who represented Nacogdoches, commented that \"Santa Anna was only a name used as an excuse for resistance to oppression\". Several delegates argued that the recently concluded civil war had left Mexico in too much turmoil to provide effective rule for Texas. Echoing the American Revolution slogan \"no taxation without representation\", one delegate insisted that Texas was not bound by Mexican laws since its settlers had no representation. This delegate overlooked the fact that Texas had been granted two representatives to the Coahuila y Tejas legislature.\n\nAustin presented an overview of the events that had occurred in Texas and in the rest of Mexico over the previous year. He enumerated several grievances against the political and judicial systems and concluded that Texas needed to become an independent state. This could be justified, in his opinion, by language in the Constitution of 1824.\n\nBy the second day of the convention, delegates were in agreement to pursue separate statehood. Austin wrote to a friend, \"We are now able to sustain A State Govt. and no country ever required one more than this\". Houston was named chairman of a committee to draft a new state constitution. Although Houston had not lived in Texas for very long, he was well-known, having served as governor of Tennessee and as a member of the United States Congress.\nThe new constitution was based on a copy of the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution provided by one of the committee members. The proposed document also drew from the constitutions of other states in the United States, including Louisiana, Missouri, and Tennessee. It provided \"meticulous detail\" for the new system of government. The executive branch structure, proposed by Austin, called for a governor who would serve two-year terms. The state would have a bicameral legislature and a three-tier judiciary system, with local and district courts ultimately kept in check by a state supreme court.\n\nA 27-article bill of rights, containing, according to historian Howard Miller, an \"impressive list\" of protected rights, was included. This document aligned closely with contemporary American political ideals, especially the notion that all men had a right to liberty. Much of the language and concepts were drawn from the first eight amendments to the United States Constitution. The document called for trial by jury, a distinct departure from Mexican law, which required that trials be heard by the local \"alcalde\". Defendants would be granted counsel and would have the right to examine any evidence against them. They would be protected from excessive bail or cruel and unusual punishments. Civil authorities would take priority over military authorities. Delegates also agreed to protect \"free communication of thoughts and opinions\", a phrase carefully drafted to imply freedom of speech, of assembly, and of the press. Although it could also be interpreted to imply freedom of religion, delegates were unwilling to explicitly grant that right, knowing that it would cause an uproar in Catholic Mexico.\n\nA few of the rights were drawn from Spanish practices. The proposed constitution forbade the English practices of primogeniture and entailment, following a change made to Spanish law in 1821. Delegates retained the traditional Spanish prohibition against seizing a debtor's physical property and extended it to forbid imprisonment as a punishment for debt. This was a novel idea. In the United States, nine states had enumerated certain conditions under which a debtor could not be imprisoned, but no state had an unqualified prohibition on the practice.\n\nBorrowing from the resolutions of the Convention of 1832, delegates wrote into the constitution a guarantee of free public education. They further banned unsecured paper currency and insisted the state economy should be based solely on hard currency. When the constitution was completed, David G. Burnet headed a subcommittee to craft a letter to Mexican authorities to explain the merits of the proposal.\n\nIn addition to the development of a state constitution, delegates passed a series of resolutions that asked Mexican authorities for reforms. Several of these echoed resolutions passed at the previous year's convention. Delegates again insisted that the ban on immigration should be repealed and that customs duties be lifted. Resolutions also requested additional protection from raids by native tribes, and that the government implement a more efficient mail delivery system.\nOne of the resolutions would have been more suited for passage by a state legislature than a group of concerned citizens. Perhaps to atone for some of the more revolutionary items they had requested, as one of their final acts delegates passed a resolution that condemned the slave trade within Texas. The Constitution of 1824 had already abolished the slave trade, and the constitution of Coahuila y Tejas had forbidden the importation of slaves into the state. Most settlers in Texas ignored the restrictions and instead converted their slaves to servants indentured for 99 years. African slaves were still imported into Texas occasionally, and a ship carrying slaves docked in Galveston Bay as the convention met. This ship, like most others used to import slaves, came from Cuba, which was a possession of Spain. Because Spain did not officially recognize Mexican independence, delegates considered this trade treasonous to Mexico.\n\nDelegates ordered that the resolution be printed in newspapers in the Mexican interior and in New Orleans. It was not printed in Texas, clearly indicating that it was intended to influence public opinion in the Mexican interior rather than in Texas. The resolution was not binding, and slaves continued to be imported to Texas through Cuba.\n\nDespite a vocal minority advocating for the unilateral implementation of the proposals, delegates agreed to present the requests to the Mexican Congress for approval. They did agree to take action if it appeared their demands would be ignored. As their last act, delegates elected Austin, James Miller, and Erasmo Seguín to deliver their petitions to Mexico City. Seguin, a prominent citizen of San Antonio de Béxar, had not attended the convention. Delegates hoped Austin could persuade Seguin to accompany him, thus implying that \"Tejanos\" supported the resolutions.\n\nWhen the convention adjourned on April 13, Austin went directly to San Antonio de Béxar to meet with Seguin. Seguin called a series of meetings, held from May 3 to 5, for prominent locals to discuss the convention proceedings. He was the only Béxar resident to fully support separate statehood. Other residents suggested that the capital of Coahuila y Tejas should be moved to San Antonio de Béxar, giving Texas more power. There was precedent for this; under Veramendi, the capital had just been moved from Saltillo to Monclova. If the legislature rejected the move, these residents vowed to support separate statehood.\n\nThe third group of residents believed that the convention, like its predecessor, was illegal. Under their interpretation of the laws, only the state legislature would be able to petition the Mexican Congress for such a drastic change. Austin argued that the laws meant that no one could petition on behalf of the people unless the people had been consulted, and the convention served as that consultation. The meetings ended with no agreement on how to proceed. Austin wrote that \"the people here agree in \"substance\" with the rest of Texas, but differ as to the manner, and will express no opinion for, nor against\".\n\nSeguin declined to accompany Austin. Miller also withdrew. Texas was in the throes of a cholera epidemic, and Miller, a physician, felt it his duty to stay and tend the sick. Austin then visited Goliad but was unable to attract any more \"Tejano\" support. He chose to go to Mexico City alone; he had visited several times and had established a good reputation among government officials. Although he was warned that his reception would likely be poor, he ignored suggestions to delay his journey.\n\nWithin the Mexican interior, rumors abounded that Texas was on the verge of revolution. Many citizens in Matamoros believed Texians had already declared independence and were raising an army. Santa Anna was infuriated, especially at the involvement of Houston, a former officer in the United States military.\n\nImmediately after Santa Anna had taken office in April, he had handed over all decision-making authority to his vice president, Valentín Gómez Farías, and retired to the countryside. Farías enacted many federalist reforms, which angered citizens and army leaders. Much of the country was clamoring for a return to centralism, yet Texians wanted to take further steps toward self-rule. By the time Austin arrived in Mexico City on July 18, several Mexican states had engaged in minor revolts against Farías's reforms. Although Texians had expelled troops within their province before Santa Anna and Farías took office, many officials identified the province with the other rebellious states and were suspicious of Austin's intentions.\n\nThe cholera epidemic reached Mexico City within days of Austin's arrival, prompting Congress to adjourn before Austin could present the convention's resolutions. As he waited for the legislature to reconvene, Austin heard rumors that Texians were planning a third convention to unilaterally declare themselves a separate state. Although Austin was also frustrated at the lack of progress, he disapproved of this drastic proposal. In an attempt to quell the more radical groups in Texas, in October Austin sent a letter to the \"ayuntamiento\" in San Antonio de Béxar in which he proposed that all of the \"ayuntamientos\" should jointly form a new state government. In what could be interpreted as an inflammatory gesture, Austin signed his letter \"\"dios y Tejas\"\" (\"God and Texas\") rather than the traditional Mexican closing \"\"dios y libertad\"\" (\"God and liberty\"). A few days after he had posted the letter, the immigration ban was repealed, assuaging one of the major Texian concerns.\n\nAustin had expected the letter to reach his friend Músquiz, who could be trusted to determine when or if it was appropriate to publicly disclose its contents. The letter arrived while Músquiz was out of town and was read by an unsympathetic \"ayuntamiento\" member. At this member's request, the \"ayuntamiento\" of San Antonio de Béxar forwarded the letter to state officials in Coahuila. The new governor, Francisco Vidaurri y Villaseñor, ordered Austin's arrest. Austin was arrested in December on suspicion of treason. He was imprisoned through all of 1834 and remained in Mexico City on bond until July 1835.\n\nDuring Austin's imprisonment, the government addressed several more of the convention's proposals. At Santa Anna's urging, the Coahuila y Tejas legislature enacted several measures to placate the Texians. In early 1834, Texas gained an additional seat in the state legislature. An American immigrant was named state Attorney General, and, for the first time, foreigners were granted explicit permission to participate in retail trade. Several American legal concepts, including trial by jury, were introduced to Texas, and English was authorized as a second language. Finally, the state created four new municipalities in Texas: Matagorda, San Augustine, Bastrop, and San Patricio. In a letter to a friend, Austin wrote \"Every evil complained of has been remedied. This fully compensates me for all I have suffered.\"\n\n\n"}

He is also well known for his tenure in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling) under the ring name Rockstar Spud.\n\nDuring his first decade, Curtin worked in the British independent circuit, winning several championships in promotions like (IPW:UK), One Pro Wrestling (1PW), Revolution Pro Wrestling (RPW), and XWA Wrestling. In 2012, he appeared in the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) program British Boot Camp, winning the competition and being signed to a contract with the promotion. In TNA, he was a two-time impact X Division Champion.\n\nHe would leave impact wrestling in October 2017 and signed a contract with WWE that same month. He would be named as the on-screen General Manager of 205 Live, the brand created by WWE for the cruiserweight division (205 lbs. and under), and served for a brief time as the manager of AOP on \"Raw\". In 2019, he became more active as an in-ring competitor, where he was a six-time WWE 24/7 Champion. He was released from the company in April 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic cutbacks. WWE still allowed Curtin to compete in the NXT Cruiserweight Championship interim tournament.\n\nJames Michael Curtin was born in Birmingham on 30 January 1983. He was originally trained by Jack Storm and Chris Gilbert at the K-Star Wrestling promotion in the Perry Barr area of Birmingham, before eventually coming under the tutelage of \"Charming\" Don Charles at the SAS Wrestling Academy. Under the ring name Spud, he went on to perform in many independent promotions within the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. While on the independent circuit, Spud's first major appearances came with the Revolution British Wrestling promotion in 2003. On 30 August 2003, Spud defeated Jack Hazard to become RBW's first British Welterweight Champion, a title he held for several months before losing it to \"The Gift\" Ross Jordan in an Iron Man match in December 2003.\n\nSpud began working for Frontier Wrestling Alliance in 2004, and was brought up into the main roster to be used as a jobber for a short time, competing against many larger opponents. During the start of 2005, however, FWA began showcasing their flyweight division; later that year, Spud entered into a tournament to crown a Flyweight Champion. He made it to the tournament final, where he was defeated by Ross Jordan, who became the first FWA Flyweight Champion. However, Jordan was only awarded the match after the referee stopped the contest due to a kayfabe injury to Spud's leg. The pair continued to feud for over 14 months, with Jordan repeatedly attacking Spud in attempts to re-injure his leg. The feud ended when Spud defeated Jordan in a Last Man Standing match at \"FWA Last Fight at the Prom\" on 30 September 2006.\n\nFollowing a talent trading agreement with the FWA, Spud made his first US appearance in April 2006, competing for Ring of Honor during their two-night \"Weekend of Champions\" shows. Spud appeared during ROH's first tour of shows in the UK in August 2006, \"Unified\" and \"Anarchy in the UK\". He competed under the FWA banner during the British Under 23's Championship event, being FWA's entry into the tournament to crown the first champion under 23 years of age. However, Spud lost to the tournament's eventual winner Sam Slam in the first round.\n\nUpon the FWA's relaunch, Spud performed under his Rockstar gimmick with an over-the-top entrance including a female security guard, a band, and a groupie. At the comeback show, New Frontiers, Spud was placed into the FWA Flyweight Championship Tournament and won the qualifying fatal four-way match. He lost in the next round to Jonny Storm. In 2010, Spud became locked in a war of words with Storm and would take part in multiple FWA Flyweight Championship tournaments. His feud with Storm culminated in a match at New Frontiers 2011, which ended in a no contest.\nSpud competed regularly for the promotion right from its creation in 2004. Through 2005, Spud had a high-profile feud with Jack Storm, which culminated in a street fight in January 2006. While in IPW:UK, Spud became one half of the tag team \"Dragon Hearts\", with fellow wrestler Dragon Phoenix. On 24 September 2006, Dragon Hearts defeated The Untouchables in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to become IPW:UK Tag Team Champions. The Dragon Hearts also got involved with IPW:UK's inter-federation feud with Frontier Wrestling Alliance, and even though Spud is a regular for that promotion he wrestled on the side of IPW:UK in a match against Team FWA. The Dragon Hearts teamed up with Leroy Kincaide to face off against Iceman, Jonny Storm, and Jorge Castano in a match that saw both Phoenix and Spud suffer injury. Phoenix suffered a deep wound to his head while Spud suffered what appeared to be a separated or dislocated shoulder due to a dropkick at the hands of Storm. Storm and Spud faced off in a grudge match in early 2007 with Spud picking up the win.\n\nSpud went on to represent IPW:UK in the joint FWA vs IPW:UK Final Frontiers show losing to Hade Vansen. After a losing effort against IPW:UK Tag team champions Swiss Money Holdings in IPW:UK's debut in Liverpool, Luke Dragon Phoenix left the promotion disbanding The Dragon Hearts. Back to singles action, Spud went on to face Big Brother contestant Billi Bhatti in a losing effort thanks to the Hated Heroes. Spud recently defeated Dave Moralez and Eamon O'Neill to advance in the opening rounds of the British National Championship but was defeated by Sam Slam in the Quarter Finals. Spud's last recent appearances for IPW:UK have seen him in losing efforts to former Gladiator's and current TNA star Magnus Nick 'Oblivion' Aldis.\n\nSpud returned to the promotion after 6 months under his \"Rockstar\" character and defeated Lion Kid to become the IPW:UK Cruiserweight Champion. Spud has appeared for the London and Midlands based promotion SAS Wrestling since its establishment in 2005. He has waged war with long-time nemesis Jack Storm after he turned on him in the \"Bring Your Jeans\" show of November 2005. Spud battled against Team Charming members for nearly a year to get his hands on Jack Storm. He faced him eventually in the final of the first SAS UK Wrestling Championship tournament by pinning his foe after a hard-fought encounter thought by many as UK Match of the Year in 2006. Spud lost the championship a month later thanks to Jack Storm's manager Charming Don Charles, and in another long feud eventually wrestled him in a one on one Bring Your Jeans Streetfight match pinning him with one foot after a steel chair shot to the head.\n\nSpud became SAS UK Champion once again by defeating Jack Storm in April 2008 in a steel cage match. Recently Spud turned his back on the fans by attacking Phil Bedwell, citing the fans not caring about him as much as they do about the former alcoholic as his motivation, and evolved into his 'Rockstar' persona. Spud defended the championship for most of 2009 against Derise Coffie and Bubblegum before finally losing the championship to Bubblegum in a Steel cage match in June 2010. Spud would continue to sporadically appear of IPW before leaving for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.\n\nAfter the feud between FWA and IPW:UK ended, the XWA promotion was founded from the remains of the FWA. Spud feuded with XWA Flyweight Champion El Ligero, defeating him in a last man standing match to become champion with help from The Kartel and Martin Stone to form 'The Firm' faction. Spud won the annual Goldrush rumble to become the No 1 Contender to the XWA Heavyweight Championship while still the XWA Flyweight Champion, which he succeeded in doing after beating Sam Slam at the 2009 Last Fight at the Prom. However, Curtin was stripped of the XWA Flyweight Championship due to his lack of defences and also lost the XWA Heavyweight Championship later in the year to Johnny Phere. Spud, since losing the XWA Heavyweight Championship, suffered a number of defeats and was then injured in September 2010 in a match with Nathan Cruz. Spud made his return in February 2011, confronting Cruz and his former allies Team Rockstar for abandoning him in the annual XWA Goldrush Rumble.\n\nPro Wrestling Guerrilla made their first tour of the UK in February 2006 where Spud teamed with Topgun Talwar and Aviv Maayan faced Excalibur, Disco Machine and Ronin in a 6-man tag team match where Spud was pinned by Excalibur. At PWG's second UK show in October 2007 Spud faced off against Joey Ryan. Ryan pinned Spud after a Superkick. Spud also became one of the top British stars in the One Pro Wrestling roster since its inception in 2005. Still competing under the out matched underdog gimmick, Spud had a longtime feud with American wrestler Sterling James Keenan and the super heavyweight Abyss. Spud and partner Luke Dragon Phoenix resurfaced in 1PW to win the Tag Team Titles in their debut as a team, but Spud left the promotion in the Winter of 2007 after losing the 1PW Tag Team Titles to The Damned Nation along with partner Luke Dragon Phoenix. Spud later returned to 1PW at The 3rd Year Anniversary, as Hubba Bubba Lucah's mystery tag team partner to finally cause the disbanding of the Damned Nation. On 15 November 2009, he defeated Darkside to win the 1PW Openweight Championship. On 20 September 2014, Spud made his debut for Chikara, losing to Juan Francisco de Coronado.\n\nOn September 5, 2012, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) announced that it had completed filming of British Boot Camp that began airing on 1 January 2013, it also including Spud. Spud won the competition and earned a spot in the TNA roster. Spud made his debut on 7 February episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", in an interview segment that was interrupted by Robbie E and Robbie T and ended with Spud attacking Robbie E. Spud made his in-ring debut on 21 February episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", defeating Robbie E.\n\nSpud returned on 18 July episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", when he took part in the Destination X episode of \"Impact Wrestling\" and entered a tournament to determine the new X Division Champion; he was defeated by Greg Marasciulo in his first round three-way match, which also included Rubix.\n\nThen, Spud was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling, TNA's developmental territory and made his debut on 13 March 2013 episode of \"OVW\". He defeated Cliff Compton for the OVW Television Championship, making him the first man to win the title in his debut match. He would go on to defend the title for 59 days and making several successful weekly defences before losing it to Randy Royal.\n\nOn 28 November episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Spud returned as Dixie Carter's new Chief of Staff. Later on the night, he hosted an in-ring Thanksgiving dinner with the entire heel roster only to be interrupted by Kurt Angle and the faces of TNA which ended in a brawl. On 30 January 2014 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", he attempted to interrogate The Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) over who The Investor was, only to get beaten down. After Team Dixie was defeated by Team MVP at Lockdown, MVP, having become the Director of Wrestling Operations, abolished the position of Chief of Staff.\n\nHowever, when his TNA contract was up for renewal in April 2014, Carter, upon her return, awarded him a 'substantial contract extension' in reward for his loyalty to her, and also retained his position as her Chief of Staff. Through TNA's relationship with Wrestle-1, Spud made his debut for the Japanese promotion in Tokyo on 6 July, teaming with Ethan Carter III in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Tajiri and Yusuke Kodama. On 4 September episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Spud came out to the ring with Ethan Carter III and cut a promo about Carter's anger at those who he held responsible for TNA President and his aunt Dixie Carter getting put through a table.\n\nOn 8 October episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Ethan Carter III called him out and gave him a chance to make amends. Carter condemned Spud for his failure to stop Bully Ray from putting his aunt, TNA President Dixie Carter, through a table, EC3 would then publicly humiliate Spud by calling him a loser and slapping him in the face. In the end, Spud fought back and immediately punched Carter, and turning face in the process. Rather than physically retaliating, EC3 fired him from his position as the Carters' chief of staff. On 22 October episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Spud teamed up with Eric Young in a losing effort against EC3 and EC3's new ally Tyrus in a Tag Team tournament.\n\nOn 23 January 2015 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Spud won the Feast or Fired match with an opportunity for the TNA X Division Championship. On 13 March episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Spud's feud with Carter ended in a Hair vs. Hair match, which Spud lost. The following week on 20 March episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Spud defeated Low Ki to win the X Division Championship. On 27 March episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", he successfully defended his title against Low Ki in a rematch. On the 1 May episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Spud lost his X Division Championship against Kenny King in a ladder match, also involving Tigre Uno and Mandrews. However, Spud won the title back on the 29 May episode of \"Impact Wrestling\" during a Gauntlet match.\n\nOn 10 June episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Spud vacated the title to gain a title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship. That same day, Spud faced Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship but failed to win the title. Later, he began feuding with Austin Aries. He defeated him on 5 August episode of \"Impact Wrestling\" in a name vs. career match, ending Aries's career at TNA.

Curtin reportedly requested the release himself after Impact told him the promotion would reduce his salary.\n\nCurtin signed with WWE in October 2017, but had to postpone his debut until his U.S. work visa was renewed. On 30 January 2018, Curtin debuted under the name Drake Maverick and was appointed the new General Manager of \"205 Live\".

While acting as a heel on the main roster, Maverick remained acting as a face General Manager on \"205 Live\". In a dark match before the 9 April episode of \"SmackDown\", Maverick managed EC3. However, the owner of WWE Vince McMahon was reported to have disliked the match and manager spots, so the partnership was not brought to television.\n\nSince the introduction of the WWE 24/7 Championship, Maverick has chased the current holder of the championship on \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\" and \"205 Live\", becoming more active as a wrestler. During his title pursuit, Maverick would create flyers of whoever the current champion was and handed them out to fans, backstage personnel, and superstars in various places. WWE management liked Maverick's ideas and, in regard, gave him a little push. On 29 May edition of \"SmackDown\", R-Truth and Maverick interrupted the Shane McMahon Appreciation Night in an impromptu match for the title, which Maverick lost. On 18 June, Maverick (disguised as R-Truth's manager Carmella) surprised R-Truth in the parking lot of the arena, pinned him for the title and immediately drove off in the referee's car. This marked his first championship win in WWE. Maverick also became the second holder - after R-Truth - to hold the title for over one day. However, he lost the title to R-Truth during his wedding, two days later. During the following episode of \"Raw\", Maverick had a rematch against R-Truth for the title, but he was quickly defeated. On 1 July episode of \"Raw\", Maverick attacked R-Truth with a suitcase and pinned him in the backstage area, while the latter was fleeing from a mob of wrestlers to become a two-time 24/7 Champion. However, Maverick lost the title to Truth 14 days later when Truth pinned him on his hotel room bed during his honeymoon. The following weeks, he would win and lose the title four times.\n\nAs part of the draft, Maverick was drafted to SmackDown brand, though he will still serve as General Manager of 205 Live. On April 12, 2020, Maverick was announced as a participant in the Interim NXT Cruiserweight Title tournament, representing Group A in the tournament. On April 15, 2020, Maverick was released from his WWE contract as part of budget cuts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, he was still expected to compete in the Interim Cruiserweight Title tournament. Maverick's release was put into his storyline for the tournament, as he continuously stated that he was not going to leave WWE without the Cruiserweight Championship. He lost his first match in the tournament against Jake Atlas, but defeated Tony Nese in his second match. On May 20, Maverick defeated Kushida, leaving his record at 2–1, tying with Atlas and Kushida.

Despite being tall and athletic, Johnson struggled to find a place on a high school basketball team. His freshman year was split at two schools (Pacific Hills, Narbonne), neither of which featured him on the court. From there, he enrolled at Verbum Dei High School, where he enjoyed a solid inaugural season of high school basketball as a sophomore in 2002–03. He then transferred to Westchester High School but was forced to sit out his junior year of 2003–04. He made up for lost time as a senior in 2004–05 as he was named the 2005 California Mr. Basketball after leading Westchester to a state title. He was subsequently named a McDonald's All-American and appeared in the 2005 Boys Game.\n\nConsidered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Johnson was listed as the No. 7 power forward and the No. 29 player in the nation in 2005.\n\nDespite committing to play for the University of Louisville, Johnson decided to skip college and declared for NBA draft.\n\nJohnson was selected by the Detroit Pistons with the 56th overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft. He is the last direct from high school player to be selected in the NBA draft (until 2015 with Satnam Singh Bhamara), as the NBA instituted a rule prior to the 2006 draft that requires American players to be at least one year removed from the graduation of their high school class to be eligible.\n\nAs a rookie for the Pistons, Johnson appeared in just three games during the 2005–06 season. He scored his first NBA basket on a windmill dunk against the Minnesota Timberwolves on January 24, 2006. On February 27, 2006, he was assigned to the Fayetteville Patriots of the NBA Development League. After appearing in 18 games for the Patriots, he was recalled by the Pistons on April 17, 2006.

In 22 games for the Skyforce, Johnson averaged 18.9 points, 9.7 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.2 steals and 3.1 blocks per game, while shooting 62.3% from the field. Despite his strong D-League play, Johnson managed just eight games for the Pistons in 2006–07, averaging 5.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game.\n\nOn July 12, 2007, Johnson re-signed with the Pistons to a three-year, $12 million contract. Over the next two seasons, Johnson played a total of 124 games for the Pistons as he became a valuable asset off the bench. He averaged 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds in 2007–08, and 3.5 points and 3.7 rebounds in 2008–09.

Moments later, Johnson was removed from the bench and returned to the locker room. Johnson was not active for the game. At the post game press conference, Embiid stated that Johnson’s daughter was very ill and he just looked at the message.

{"id": "2180910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180910", "title": "Return to Innocence", "text": "Return to Innocence\n\n\"Return to Innocence\" is a song by German musical group Enigma. It was released on 4 January 1994 as the lead single from their second album, \"The Cross of Changes\".\n\nIt became the project's most successful international single after \"Sadeness (Part I)\", reaching number one in over 10 countries (including Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Zimbabwe), number three on the UK Singles Chart, and the top five in several countries, including Canada, Germany and New Zealand. It also reached the top 20 in France and number two on the Eurochart Hot 100. \"Return to Innocence\" was the project's biggest hit in the United States, reaching number two on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart, number four on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and number six on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Top 40.\n\nThe song's melodic and talking vocals in English are provided by Angel X (Andreas Harde), and a short talking vocal by Sandra (\"It's not the beginning of the end, it's the return to yourself, the return to innocence\"), while an Amis people chant (\"Elders' Drinking Song\") is repeated, which opens the song. Difang and Igay Duana, from the Amis, were in a cultural exchange program in Paris in 1988 when their performance of the song was recorded by the Maison des Cultures du Monde and later distributed on CD. The producer of Enigma, Michael Cretu, later obtained the CD and proceeded to sample it. In addition, the drum beat of the song was sampled from the Led Zeppelin song \"When the Levee Breaks\", played by John Bonham.\n\nThe song was used to promote several types of media in the mid-1990s, including film and TV commercials. In autumn 1994, the song was featured in an episode of the TV show \"My So-Called Life\". In 1995, the song was used as the closing theme in Disney's live-action film \"Man of the House\", as well as in the opening and closing of an \"Outer Limits\" episode. In 1996, the song was further popularised when it was used in a television advertisement to promote the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\nJulien Temple directed the video, which depicts a man's life in reverse, starting with him dying and ending with his baptism as a baby. (See also List of Enigma videos#The Cross of Changes).\n\nLarry Flick from \"Billboard\" wrote that Enigma \"resurfaces with a far more accessible, but no less cool pop/hip-hop kicker. The track's insistent beat is good bait for a song that is chock-full of unusual male chants and breathy female vamping. Somewhere between the two is an irresistible hook and melody that assures much-deserved success at both radio and club level.\" \"Cashbox\" noted, \"Now, experts at the Virgin Records hitmaking laboratory have concocted a new, even more startling scenario: Enigma as hit song-makers! Wild, but true. The life's work of one Michael Cretu, a zealous Romanian attempting to go where no new age musician has gone before. Enigma is threatening to break free of the genre's tacky shackles, making the world safe for ambient artists everywhere.\" Jonathan Riggs from \"Idolator\" commented, \"If all of human existence across time were a movie, \"Return to Innocence\" is the song that should play over the end credits.\" He added, \"\"Return to Innocence\" was then and remains now universally epic, instantly recognizable, largely incomprehensible and endlessly moving. Like us. Like life.\" John Kilgo from \"The Network Forty\" described the song as a \"melodramatic chant\". Richard Paton from \"Toledo Blade\" said that it \"captures that melange of sounds, the intensity of the beat, and the wafting vocals and chant\"\n\nIn March 1998, Difang and Igay Duana sued Cretu, Virgin Records, and a number of recording companies for unauthorised usage of their song without credit. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money and all further releases of the song were credited (including royalties) to the Duanas, aka the Kuos — their Chinese name. The Kuos were an indigenous Taiwanese couple from the Ami tribe. Cretu has stated that he had been led to believe that the recording was in the public domain and that he did not intentionally violate the Kuos' copyright.\n\n4-track CD single\n\n5-track CD single\n"}

The relation of the literary references to an \"asherah\" and archaeological finds of Judaean pillar-figurines has engendered a literature of debate.\n\nThe asherim were also cult objects related to the worship of Asherah, the consort of either Ba'al or, as inscriptions from Kuntillet ‘Ajrud and Khirbet el-Qom attest, Yahweh, and thus objects of contention among competing cults. In translations of the Hebrew Bible that render the Hebrew \"asherim\" into English as \"Asherah poles,\" the insertion of \"pole\" begs the question by setting up unwarranted expectations for such a wooden object: \"we are never told exactly what it was\", observes John Day. The traditional interpretation of the Biblical text is that the Israelites imported pagan elements such as the Asherah poles from the surrounding Canaanites. In light of archeological finds, however, modern scholars now theorize that the Israelite folk religion was Canaanite in its inception and always polytheistic and it was the prophets and priests who denounced the Asherah poles who were the innovators; such theories inspire ongoing debate.\n\nAsherim are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the books of Exodus, Deuteronomy, Judges, the Books of Kings, the second Book of Chronicles, and the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Micah. The term often appears as merely \"אשרה\", (\"Asherah\") referred to as \"groves\" in the King James Version, which follows the Septuagint rendering as ἄλσος, pl. ἄλση and the Vulgate \"lucus\", and \"poles\" in the New Revised Standard Version; no word that may be translated as \"poles\" appears in the text. Scholars have indicated, however, that the plural use of the term (English \"Asherahs\", translating Hebrew \"Asherim\" or \"Asherot\") provides ample evidence that reference is being made to objects of worship rather than a transcendent figure.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible suggests that the poles were made of wood. In the sixth chapter of the Book of Judges, God is recorded as instructing the Israelite judge Gideon to cut down an Asherah pole that was next to an altar to Baal. The wood was to be used for a burnt offering.\n\nDeuteronomy 16:21 states that YHWH (rendered as \"the \") hated \"Asherim\" whether rendered as poles: \"Do not set up any [\"wooden\"] Asherah [\"pole\"] beside the altar you build to the your God\" or as living trees: \"You shall not plant any tree as an Asherah beside the altar of the Lord your God which you shall make\". That Asherahs were not always living trees is shown in 1 Kings 14:23: \"their asherim, beside every luxuriant tree\". However, the record indicates that the Jewish people often departed from this ideal. For example, King Manasseh placed an Asherah pole in the Holy Temple (2 Kings 21:7). King Josiah's reforms in the late 7th century BC included the destruction of many Asherah poles (2 Kings 23:14).\n\nExodus 34:13 states: \"Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherim [Asherah poles].\"\n\nSome biblical archaeologists have suggested that until the 6th century BC the Israelite peoples had household shrines, or at least figurines, of Asherah, which are strikingly common in the archaeological remains.\n\nRaphael Patai identified the pillar figurines with Asherah in \"The Hebrew Goddess\".\n"}

The song was released as the third single from \"The Cross of Changes\".\n\nThe song can be regarded as a remixed version of an earlier Enigma song, \"Carly's Song\", where the song was originally more laid back and goes at a slower pace. The vocals in the song are whispered by Sandra Cretu.\n\nThe haunting chant in this song is of Mongolian origin and has a tinge of Gregorian chanting in it. It is from the Mongolian traditional long song, \"Tosonguyn Oroygoor\", sung by Dechinzundui Nadmid. For the \"Enigmatic Club Mix\", the beat of the song was pushed up a notch and laced generously with beeps of morse code throughout the song. The morse code spells out \"I love you\". For the \"Jam & Spoon Remix\", the song starts off with a short and relaxing piano piece. Although included in the \"Age of Loneliness\" single, it is exactly the same one found in the \"Carly's Song\" single.\n\nIn the music video for the song, the scene is set in New York City and entirely filmed in sepia. People are seen floating through the air weightlessly but remain unseen by the surrounding people.\n\nThe background of the single cover is mostly white (or beige) and has a tarot card placed in the centre. The figure in the card might be seen as a wizard at first glance, but the person is actually a thin Santa Claus conjuring up toys. The number \"7\" which appears at the four corners of the card indicates that the song is the seventh track in \"The Cross of Changes\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2180939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180939", "title": "Alpha 66", "text": "Alpha 66\n\nAlpha 66 is an anti-Castro paramilitary organization that operates in the Southern United States. The group was originally formed by Cuban exiles in the early 1960s and was most active in the late 1970s and 1980s. Although its base of support has greatly eroded due to the end of the Cold War and the thawing of relations between the United States and Cuba, Alpha 66 is still active today and is recognized as a terrorist organization by state governments and research groups alike.\n\nAlpha 66 was founded by Cuban exiles in the early 1960s to act as an anti-Castro, paramilitary group. Although it has undergone changes in personnel and leadership, it still exists today and is based out of Florida. Alpha 66 was most active during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but remains active in the Miami area. At the height of its power, Alpha 66 operated at a level similar to Abdala, Brigade 2506, Omega 7, and the FLNC (Cuban National Liberation Front) amongst other Cuban-exile paramilitary groups. It claimed to have sixty-three chapters in operation during 1977.\n\nLike many other Cuban exile paramilitary groups, Alpha 66 presented itself as a patriotic organization that wished to undo the betrayal to the revolution that was Fidel Castro's government. Alpha 66's founding members included many Cubans who had fought as revolutionaries against the Batista government alongside Fidel Castro and Alpha 66's anthem directly references Fidel Castro as having betrayed the ideals that the group's members originally fought for. Alpha 66's anti-communist rhetoric and staunch opposition to the Cuban government earned it the overwhelming support of the Miami exile community as well as the sympathy of a select few anti-communist American politicians.\n\nAlpha 66 had multiple founders including Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo, who had served twenty years in a Cuban prison for counterrevolutionary activities, and Antonio Veciana. Early on, some members of Alpha 66 also partook in the United States-sponsored Volunteer Program, which allowed Cuban exiles to form all-Cuban military units within the United States Army. Additionally, members of Alpha 66 received limited funding and training from the CIA; however, this support did not last. The CIA found that it had little control over the actions of Alpha 66 and, in many cases, Alpha 66 carried out operations without the CIA's approval or consultation, leading to the CIA ending its involvement with the group, which in turn caused many Alpha 66 members to become disillusioned with the United States government for its lack of support. Despite the lack of government support, Alpha 66 still managed to train its members throughout the everglades of Florida.\n\nAs hope for a United States-led invasion of Cuba died down amongst exiles, a growing number of Cuban exiles began to promote reconciliation between the United States and Cuba as well as peaceful methods of change within Cuba. In Alpha 66's case, some members broke off and started a group known as Cambio Cubano (Cuban Change). Notably, Gutierrez Menoyo and Antonio Veciana became strong advocates for national dialogue between Cuba and the United States. By 1974, most Cuban exiles figured that the Cuban government could not be overthrown by a militant group and instead decided to support cooperation between the United States and Cuba. The Cuban exiles were labeled “dialogueros” as opposed to the “hardliners” who still wished to overthrow Cuba's communist regime and the Castro government by force. One Miami Herald poll found that only twenty-eight percent of the Cuban exile population in the area supported dialogue between the United States and the Castro government.\n\nAlthough the United States was originally unable to halt Alpha 66's terrorist operations due to issues arising between United States Customs and the Department of Justice, there were other reasons for its lack of action on the issue of Alpha 66. At the time of Alpha 66's founding, the United States was committed to overthrowing Fidel Castro's communist government, which further complicated the efforts of the United States to stop Alpha 66's activities because both actors were momentarily aligned in their goal. However, as time passed, and tensions eased between the United States and Cuba, the United States government began to specifically target paramilitary exile groups and other terrorist cells, making clear its lack of support for the illegal activities that many militants attempted to undertake. By the 1980s, the United States organized special task forces to further crack down on the terrorist activities of groups like Alpha 66. This, and the growing support for the “dialogueros” movement, led most Cuban exile paramilitary organizations to breakup by the mid 1980s.\n\nAlthough Alpha 66's power began to wane in the early 1980s, it never formally disbanded and still maintains a weak presence in the Southern United States. The Miami area is home to some of the last active Alpha 66 cells. There are many Alpha 66 websites in operation today, however; most are old and have not been updated since the 1990s or early 2000s. One such website can be found in the \"External References\" section of this page. Alpha 66's doctrine of violent change in Cuba has largely been overturned in favor a peaceful reforms and coexistence between the Cuban government and Cuban exiles. Alpha 66 is an acknowledged terrorist organization and as such has no official sponsor, nor is there an official figurehead for the group. The end of the Cold War, death of Fidel Castro, and warming of relations between the United States and Cuba has made Alpha 66's reason for existing largely nonexistent, especially when paired with the change in popular opinion as to how to bring about change in Cuba. Despite appearing as though Alpha 66 will be on the way out, it has managed to maintain some level of relevance and appears in local news every now and again, but this source of publicity and relevance is also beginning to dry up, leaving Alpha 66 to quietly dissolve like so many other anti-Castro organizations created after 1959.\n\n\n"}

It was produced by Lorimar Productions for 20th Century Fox, and released theatrically on August 15, 1986.\n\nThe film stars Lucy Deakins as 14-year-old Milly Michaelson, Jay Underwood as Eric Gibb, a boy with autism, Bonnie Bedelia as Milly's mother, Fred Savage as Milly's little brother, Colleen Dewhurst as a teacher, Fred Gwynne as Eric's uncle, Janet MacLachlan, and Mindy Cohn. After the suicide of her terminally ill father, Milly becomes friends with Eric, who lost both of his parents to a plane crash. Together, Eric and Milly find ways to cope with the loss and the pain as they escape to faraway places.\n\nFourteen-year-old Amelia \"Milly\" Michaelson (Deakins) and her family move into a new suburban home shortly after the death of her father. Milly makes friends with her new neighbor Geneva, and Milly and her eight-year-old brother Louis (Savage) have difficulty adjusting to their new schools, while their mother Charlene (Bedelia) copes with a demotion at work and her inability to learn how to use a computer. Louis is also plagued by bullies down the street who won't let him get around the block. During the first night at the house, Milly is in her bedroom talking to her pet bird. Something flies past the window, but when Milly goes to investigate she sees nothing.\n\nMilly and Geneva observe Eric Gibb (Underwood), an autistic boy living next door with his alcoholic uncle Hugo (Gwynne). Eric has never spoken a word in his life, doesn't like to be around people and exhibits bizarre behavior related to flying. Milly hears that Eric's parents died in a plane crash. Later that night, Milly and her family watch as Eric and three adults appear outside with Eric in a straitjacket and being restrained by two men. Milly later reveals to Geneva one night when Milly's mother is out for the evening that she finds Eric attractive.\n\nAlthough Eric cannot communicate with anyone, he begins to react to Milly. Mrs. Sherman observes this interaction and asks Milly to keep an eye on Eric, explaining that because of Uncle Hugo's drinking, Eric is in constant danger of being taken by authorities and placed in a hospital. Milly works with Eric over the course of the school year and takes notes on his progress, which is slow at first. Milly notes excitedly the first time Eric smiles on his own rather than merely copying her own smile. Eric does nothing when Milly throws balls to him, except for one day when he spontaneously reaches out and catches a stray baseball flying toward Milly's head.\n\nStrange occurrences, like Eric's apparent ability to appear in his own window one instant and in Milly's the next without any link between their homes, begin to make Milly question reality. \n\nOn a school field trip, with no one present except Eric, Milly falls off a bridge while trying to pick a rose. Knocked unconscious, she dreams that she wakes up in the hospital, with Eric sitting on the windowsill. After a conversation with him (albeit wordless on Eric's part), she becomes convinced he can fly. Eric gives her the rose she was trying to reach and then, taking her hand, leads her out of the window and the two begin flying. The two watch a fireworks display from a cloud before they share a kiss and return to the hospital window. After watching Eric fly off, Milly's dream becomes a nightmare as she sees her Dad in a hospital bed, dead, with a girl called Mona throwing a volleyball at her which knocks her out of the window.\n\nMilly then wakes up in a hospital and tells her mother that Eric can fly and that he caught her as she fell. A shrink, Dr. Grenader, talks to Milly and tells her that Eric caught her as she only has a concussion and no serious injuries. Dr Grenader, however, puts forth a more logical explanation and explains her belief that Eric can fly may be due to stress caused by the death of her father as he died from cancer.\n\nUpon returning home, Milly notices the rose on her windowsill and becomes convinced that Eric can fly. When she shouts to Uncle Hugo about Eric's whereabouts, he replies by saying the institute has taken him away as Hugo was found drunk again. Despite the efforts of Milly and her family, they are not allowed to see Eric. As they leave, Eric tries to force the window open and is restrained by two men who try to sedate him. Another attempt by Louis to get around the block fails as the bullies tear his tricycle apart and to make matters worse, his dog Max is hit by a passing car and is taken to an animal hospital.\n\nLater that evening, Milly thinks she spots Eric on his roof during a thunderstorm and after climbing into the attic, she finds Eric, who is soaked from the rain and shivering with cold. As Milly pulls a blanket around him, he pulls out a box and from within it, he takes out a ring which he gives to Milly.\n\nWhen the authorities arrive at Eric's house the next day, Milly sneaks Eric out, and the police chase them to the roof of the school during a carnival. Eric turns to Milly and speaks her name, the first word he has spoken thus far. Milly asks Eric if he really can fly, and he smiles and nods his head. He holds her hand and the two fall off the building. Just before hitting the ground, Milly and Eric begin flying in plain view of the crowd around the carnival, which follows Milly and Eric down the streets of their town, shocking Charlene, Louis, Geneva, and Uncle Hugo. Eric brings Milly to her own window, tells her he loves her, and kisses her before he says goodbye and flies away.\n\nMilly is heartbroken, but quickly realizes why Eric had to leave: Over the following weeks, spectators, policemen, and scientists mob the town, looking for an explanation and taking all of Eric's belongings away to be analyzed. Milly speculates that Eric too would have been taken by scientists had he remained. It is revealed that Milly's father knew he had cancer, but kept it a secret from his family because he did not want them to worry. Rather than seek treatment, he said goodbye and committed suicide. \n\nEric's uncle beats his drinking problem and gets an excellent job. The Michaelsons' dog Max gets better. Louis dominates the bullies down the street using a water gun full of urine. Charlene masters the computer at work. Milly regains interest in her life and relationships with those around her. The movie ends with Milly looking out the window waiting for Eric. As the sun sets, she throws out a paper airplane which flies ever upward.\n\n\"The Boy Who Could Fly\" currently holds a 63% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews.\n\nThe movie debuted at No. 4.\n\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton. Varèse Sarabande released a re-recording of highlights in 1986 on LP and cassette (later reissued on compact disc as part of the Varese Encore line), performed by the Sinfonia of London and conducted by the composer; in 2002 Percepto released the film recordings of Broughton's music as a limited edition promotional release. Intrada Records issued the complete score in 2015, including Stephen Bishop's \"Walkin' On Air\" (written and recorded for the film's end credits in lieu of Broughton's unused end title cue) and the brief song \"Back Of The Bus\" (written by screenwriter Nick Castle and Broughton).\n\nThe band The Coupe de Villes (composed of Nick Castle, horror director/composer/screenwriter/musician John Carpenter and director Tommy Lee Wallace) appear in a cameo on a television in a scene in the film playing their original song \"Back on the Bus\". The band is known today for their theme song \"Big Trouble in Little China\" for the movie with the same name directed by Carpenter, and their 1985 album \"Waiting Out The Eighteens\".\n\n\n\n\nThe band Thrice released a song based on the film, titled \"A Song For Milly Michaelson\" on their 2007 LP \"The Alchemy Index Vols. III & IV\". So did the Vandals, on the album \"Hitler Bad, Vandals Good\".\n\n"}

In the early 1980s, she started performing around the Harlem area in clubs as the lead singer of a band called Nythjar. After meeting her husband, she relocated to England in the late 1980s, and retired from the music scene to take care of her daughter Rikki.\n\nGordon resumed her singing career in 1988 singing lead vocals for club-oriented acts such as Offshore, Deja Vu and most notably, House ensemble Quartzlock, releasing the singles \"No Regrets\", \"Love Eviction\" and \"You Make Loving Fun\". In 1989, she contributed lead vocals to Simon Harris' cover of the On the House song \"(I've Got Your) Pleasure Control\", which became her first charting single in the UK. The record brought her to the attention of Supreme Records, who offered her a deal in 1989.\n\nThe first single on the Supreme label, a cover of First Choice's \"Let No Man Put Asunder\" (re-titled \"It's Not Over (Let No Man Put Asunder)\"), was a club hit but did not translate into pop success. For her next single, \"Happenin' All Over Again\", Gordon collaborated with British hitmaking team Stock Aitken & Waterman. The song had originally been written for Donna Summer, but Gordon was offered the track as Summer never found the time to get back to London for recording and had had a long association with the record label dating back to 1985 with the Supreme act Princess. The single was released in January 1990. It peaked at No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart, and became a huge hit around Europe.\n\nThe planned follow-up single, the uptempo \"How Could He Do This To Me\", was scrapped (and was never released until years later), and the ballad \"Beyond Your Wildest Dreams\" was released instead in August 1990. The single peaked at No. 48. In November 1990, Gordon released her debut album's title track \"If I Have To Stand Alone\", which had a similar sound to \"Happenin' All Over Again\". The single charted at No. 68 in the UK. Her debut album, \"If I Have To Stand Alone\", only received a limited release in Europe, Australia (where it peaked at No. 173 on the ARIA Albums Chart) and Japan but to rave reviews.\n\nIn 1991, Gordon flew to Italy and recorded the song \"Gonna Catch You\", written and produced by the Italo house group Black Box. It was released as a single in the UK where it became a top 40 hit, peaking at No. 32. Due to its inclusion in the Vanilla Ice film \"Cool As Ice\", the song became her debut release in the U.S., where it peaked at No. 1 on the U.S. Dance charts and at No. 79 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. This was Gordon's last release with Supreme Records.\n\nSigned to SBK Records, Gordon released her second album \"Bad Mood\" in 1993. The album included two further U.S. No. 1 Dance singles, \"Bad Mood\", and a re-recorded \"Happenin' All Over Again\", which also peaked at No. 98 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. A follow up single, \"Do You Want It\", also did well on the dance charts in 1994.\n\nGordon has hit the U.S. dance chart two more times in 1996, with the songs \"Dirty Love\" on Geffen Records, which peaked at No. 6, and \"If You Really Love Me\" released on Big Bang Records, which peaked at No. 42. In 2000, she released the compilation album \"No Regret\", which included many of her singles and album highlights, as well as two new songs. A cover of \"He Lives in You\", was released as its lead single. Also, in 1997, Lonnie Gordon worked with European dance producers P.O.F., Roland Michael and Demetrius Ross and remixed the single, If You Really Love Me originally written and recorded by Stevie Wonder.\n\nIn 2002, Gordon starred as the lead vocalist and narrator for \"Zumanity\" another side of Cirque du Soleil, in Las Vegas. Working with Cirque du Soleil and moving to Las Vegas, was a bold career move that provided an opportunity for Gordon to showcase her strong vocals and incredible stage presence. After leaving Cirque du Soleil, Gordon made her way back to London, England and constantly toured, working with uk based company Allaboutdivas.com\n\nIn 2007, Gordon established her own label Gordon Records, from which she released four compilation albums including several new songs. She also exhibited her paintings around this time in Las Vegas.\n\nA remastered special edition CD of her unreleased UK 1990 album, \"If I Have To Stand Alone\", was released in April 2009 on the Cherry Pop record label, with additional unreleased mixes from PWL's vaults.\n\nIn 2009, \"Catch You Baby\", a re-recording of the 1991 hit, \"Gonna Catch You\", was released by Positiva/EMI as a digital-only download in early August 2009, with a host of mixes, including by a mixes by Pete Hammond and 7TH Heaven.\n\nIn 2010–2011 Gordon again toured the UK and Europe to much acclaim as well as giving her time to perform at major H.I.V / A.I.D.S benefits worldwide.

He was the son of Stu and Helen Hart and the younger brother of Smith, Bruce, Keith and Wayne, as well as older brother of Ellie, Georgia, Bret, Alison, Ross, Diana and Owen Hart. Dean was widely regarded as the most handsome of the Hart brothers. He died at the age of 36 in 1990, from a heart attack induced by kidney failure.\n\nHe was of Greek descent through his maternal grandmother and Irish through his maternal grandfather. His father was mainly of Scots-Irish descent but also had Scottish and English ancestry. Hart was a dual citizen of Canada and the United States thanks to his mother Helen, who was born in New York.\n\nHe was nicknamed Bizz (or Biz) by his siblings. His sister Diana has claimed that it was because he was always so busy with working on something, but his brother Bret said in his that it was because he was always up to some mischievous business. As a child he once accidentally started a fire in the Hart House while playing in the top floor.\n\nHart was a good fighter and was the first of his siblings to win an amateur wrestling championship at high school.\n\nBorn to Stu and Helen Hart, Dean Hart began wrestling in his father's Stampede Wrestling promotion along with younger brothers Bret and Owen Hart during the 1970s. Dean was widely regarded as the most handsome of the Stu Hart's sons. He also helped out behind the scenes for Stampede later on but remained mostly preoccupied with other endeavours during the 80s. Hart worked together with his brothers Bret and Bruce in Dory Funk's Amarillo wrestling promotion in Texas during the very early 70s. They were invited to travel to Amarillo due to the fact that they and Funk had become very good friends. The three of them traveled there alone and Bruce Hart described the journey as something akin to \"Stand By Me\" as they ran into several misadventures along the way, including getting chased by people who mistook them for hippies due to their long hair.\n\nDean regularly filled in as a referee for his older brother Wayne when Wayne was sick, Dean portrayed his character as a less traditional sympathetic light than Wayne, being more a competent, strict and fair judge as opposed to a heroic one, to differentiate their characters more as Wayne was Stampede's main \"babyface\" referee. On one occasion in 1988, Hart was forced to judge a match alone without a partner as Jurgen Hermann, who was meant to be the main referee of the match, was absent from the show for unknown reasons, and Wayne was out with a knee injury. The match was a Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship match between Chris Benoit and Johnny Smith. Hart ended up accidentally botching the finish of the match, leading to Benoit regaining the title from Smith. This was not meant to happen as Dean was supposed to notice that Benoit's manager had thrown in an object for him to use in the ring to cheat, but Hart did not know this part of the match as he had not been told about it so he failed to disqualify him and Benoit won the title. This resulted in the promotion having to issue a rematch on 6/24 in Calgary.\n\nHart vacationed many times and lived in Hawaii for lengthy times and befriended many wrestlers there, among them Prince Sui who later worked for his Stampede Wrestling on recommendation from Hart. Hart was also later associated with Lia Maivia and Peter Maivia's Hawaii promotion, which was under the National Wrestling Alliance. While in Hawaii he became close to Maivia's grandson Dwayne Johnson (later known under the ringname The Rock). Despite this he remained one of the Hart children with the least involvement with the wrestling business.\n\nHart began promoting music shows at a very young age and held the first ever outdoors concert in Calgary when he was nineteen years old, the event was called \"Fantasy Park\" and featured people such as Charlie Rich and comedian Billie Holiday as well as model Barbi Benton as a special guest.\n\nHart regularly promoted music concerts in Clearwater Beach, which was owned by his father. He booked musical acts such as The Doors and Joe Cocker. Some time during the 80s he and his brother Bruce booked the band Iron Butterfly to perform on the beach this proved lead to difficulties when some of the band members got intoxicated.\n\nSome of Hart's rock concerts on the beach ended up being mismanaged and did not turn a profit. This led to payment issues and resulted in the area being burned down.\n\nAt some point in the early 80s Hart, perhaps unwittingly, got involved in the Samoan mafia, he helped transport some boxes which contained weapons. Later the gangsters threatened Hart's life since they believed that he would testify against them in court when they were facing murder charges.\n\nHart and his girlfriend Tammy had a daughter named Farrah Hart, born in April 1990.\n\nHe suffered serious injuries in 1978 when struck by a city bus, the accident severely damaged his kidneys. He told his family very little of the accident. Diagnosed with Bright's disease during the late 1980s, he died of a heart attack on November 21, 1990 at the Hart family mansion. He was cremated. Dean's death had a severe effect on his brother Bret, making him extremely distraught as he felt that they had grown apart too much in their later years. He was unsatisfied with how their last interactions had ended up, leaving him feeling like their relationship never got to recover like he wanted, and that in difference from their younger brother Owen, who died in 1999, affected things between them that could have been said and sorted out, but never were. Bret was also never offered time off by WWF or Vince McMahon, and he wrestled the next day. Family friend and fellow wrestler Dory Funk Jr. was also very affected, stating that he felt like he had lost one of his own children since their families had always been so close.\n\nDean was the first of the Hart family to suffer an early death. Dean's death shook the family's feeling of aplomb and the sense of invincibility that they had developed as a tight knit group, semi-isolated from mainstream society outside of the wrestling business. His sister, Diana Hart, stated in her book that had any members of the Hart family been tested as a compatible donor, a kidney transplant might have saved his life. However, this option was never properly discussed by the family. His brother Bret has stated that the family was aware of the possibility of a transplant but that Dean had not been following the doctor‘s instruction about his diet and not done his daily dialysis as he had been told, this resulted in Dean dying unexpectedly at home before he could be taken to the hospital by their father.\n\nHis death was the day before the WWF Survivor Series that year, and commentator Roddy Piper stated that Bret dedicated his match to Dean. Bret stated in a 2015 \"Sports Illustrated\" interview that the match felt important to him despite him losing it.\n\nHart's older brother Smith named two of his sons (Chad and Matt) Dean in middle name in honour of him. His sister Diana dedicated a chapter in her book \"Under the Mat\", named \"Dean\", to him. There is also a tribute video to Hart in his brother Bret's DVD documentary \"\". A segment on the Hart family DVD \"\" released by WWE is called \"A letter from Dean\" and focuses on his life and death.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2180967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180967", "title": "Milton Keynes Lightning", "text": "Milton Keynes Lightning\n\nThe Milton Keynes Lightning are a semi-professional ice hockey team founded in 2002 in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. The Lightning play in Britain's tier-2 National League, a division within the National Ice Hockey League (NIHL), since the 2019–20 season. The Lightning previously competed in the tier-3/tier-2 English Premier Ice Hockey League (EPIHL) from 2002–2017 and the top tier Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) from 2017–2019. Their home rink is 2,200-seat Planet Ice Arena Milton Keynes, known locally as the MK Arena or the Thunderdome.\n\nFounded in 2002, MK Lightning moved into the empty space left by the departure of the Milton Keynes Kings. The MK Kings were involved in a dispute with rink operators Planet Ice, which led to their relocation to Solihull in May 2002. There they became the Solihull MK Kings before being wound up in April 2003, after a single season.\n\nThe demise of the Ice Hockey Superleague in 2002/03 led to major restructuring of Ice Hockey in the UK. The Milton Keynes Lightning became a founding member of the new Elite Ice Hockey League but competed in the lower English Premier Ice Hockey League. The first Lightning squad was made up mainly of young local players, one Finnish import, Mikko Skinnari and three Canadian imports, Nick Poole as Player Coach, Claude Dumas, and Dwayne Newman. Lightning finished their maiden season in 2nd place, behind Peterborough Phantoms. The two teams met again in the playoff final, with Lightning winning. A rivalry quickly grew between them as they continued to dominate EPL Ice Hockey, MK Lightning were crowned league champions in 2003–04 and 2004–05 as well as dominating the Playoffs until 2006. During this period there was a heavy reliance on Player Coach Nick Poole and Telford born Gary Clarke for points scoring.\n\nThe 2006–07 season saw Lightning struggle for the first time. A lack of quality new players, core older players leaving, predictable tactics and an improved opposition being the main drivers. The team ended the season in 5th place and were eliminated from the Playoffs in the first round. 2007/08 saw the situation worsen, with a league finish of 6th. This resulted in a roster overhaul for the new season.\n\nThe Lightning squad for the 2008–09 season included several experienced ex-Elite League players, young British talent and new European imports including Lukas Zatopek, Andre Smulter and Joakim Wiklander as an injury replacement for Ales Perez whose career was ended by a serious shoulder injury. After a slow start the team dominated the second half of the season and finished runners-up behind Peterborough. They then met again in the playoff final with the Phantoms winning the encounter. Lightning became the team to beat in 2009–10, despite Elite league Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix joining the EPIHL. Further squad strengthening in the form of former AIK player Monir Kalgoum and the addition of netminder Alex Mettam helped Lightning dominate and a home win against Swindon Wildcats in March 2010 saw the EPIHL league trophy return to Milton Keynes.\n\nDespite the addition of Slovenian International Blaz Emersic, an inconsistent 2010–11 season saw Lightning finish 5th in the league and lose the play off final to Guildford Flames. 2011–12 fared no better, with the team again finishing 5th; having led the league in December. The team lost in the playoff quarter finals to eventual winners Slough Jets, despite taking a three-goal lead into the away leg. The 2012–13 season brought upheaval when just ten games into the season marque signing Adam Calder suffered a catastrophic hip injury which ended his career. Then in January 2013 Nick Poole who was by now considered a Milton Keynes Lightning legend unexpectedly announced his immediate retirement from playing. Lightning finished in 4th place and lost to Guildford Flames in the play off semi-finals.\n\nThe disruption continued in 2013–14 as home games were played in Coventry due to the renovation of the Milton Keynes rink. Due to a lack of practice ice time, the team struggled for consistency but finished in a credible 4th place. They were also the runners up to Basingstoke Bison in the cup. The 2014–15 season started with Lightning continuing to play out of Coventry. Indifferent early form left the team languishing near the bottom of the league. The refurbishment of the Milton Keynes rink was completed a month into the season and the first game back on home territory was played on 18 October 2014 against Sheffield Steeldogs in front of a capacity crowd of 2,500. Despite the return to home ice; Lightning continued to perform poorly. The loss of key players through roster changes and a series of injuries increased pressure on an already struggling team saw Lightning finish the season in 7th place, their lowest ever position. Despite poor league performances, Lightning defeated Guildford in the playoff quarter finals before losing to Manchester Phoenix in the semi final game.\n\nAt the end of the 2014–2015 season it was announced that head coach Nick Poole would take over the duties of General Manager from Vito Rausa and be replaced by Team GB coach Peter Russell. This was shortly followed by the announcement in May 2015 that Milton Keynes Lightning would be forming a partnership with Elite League side the Coventry Blaze. This partnership lasted just one season. The 2015–16 season also saw a change from the traditional white, black, and gold colours to a white, black, and blue combination which reflected the sponsorship of local company Smith Recycling. Despite a promising start, the season ended with MKL managing just a slight improvement on their previous years final position, finishing 5th. Lightning went on to qualify for the Play Off final, losing to Guildford Flames 6–2. At the end of the season it was also announced that from the start of the 2017–2018 season, Milton Keynes Lightning would play in the Elite Ice Hockey League.\n\nIn November 2016, Nick Poole stepped down from the role of General Manager, citing that he wanted to pursue new challenges with his family outside of hockey. Lightning secured a 2nd place league finish in their final EPL season and on 18 March 2017 won their first EPL cup in a penalty shootout against Peterborough. In the playoff campaign, Lightning finished 2nd in their group, winning 5 out of 6 games to qualify for the finals weekend. Lightning would then go on to win their 5th playoff title, beating Guildford 8–3 in the semi-final and then defeating Telford in the final 7–2.\n\nFollowing the announcement in May 2015, Milton Keynes Lightning formally joined the Elite League for the 2017–2018 season. With this also came a change in ownership. Planet Ice, the Milton Keynes rink operators who had run the franchise since its temporary use of the Coventry Sky Dome during the 2013–2014 season sold the club to the Midlands-based husband and wife team of Graham and Monica Moody. Lightning's inaugural season in the Elite League had a promising start but poor away form and a series of disappointing results left them languishing near the bottom of the table at the turn of the new year. The situation worsened in January when US Import Matt Nickerson had his contract terminated after an altercation with a Guildford Flames fan when leaving the ice. In February 2018 it was announced that Coach Peter Russell would be leaving the club by mutual consent at the end of the season and replaced by Canadian Doug McKay. The team finished 11th in the league and outside of the play off places.\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2018–19 season, with the team languishing at the bottom of the league, Doug McKay himself parted company with Milton Keynes Lightning in November 2018 citing 'personal reasons'. Coaching responsibilities initially passed to players Ryan Lannon and Tim Wallace, with Wallace taking sole charge for the remainder of the season in January 2019. In March 2019 it was announced that MK Lightning's two-year stay in the Elite League would come to an end and that from the 2019–2020 season the team would complete in the new National Hockey League, a two import league equivalent in the British ice hockey structure to the defunct English Premier Ice Hockey League (EPIHL). The reason behind this return to the second tier of UK Ice Hockey was financial. Lightning finished the season a disappointing 11th, 24 points behind 10th placed Dundee Stars.\n\nSoon after the completion of the 2018–2019 season and the decision to leave the Elite League, Milton Keynes Lightning announced that Lewis Clifford would be the Head Coach for the inaugural season of the new NIHL National league. Clifford had been a stalwart of the Milton Keynes Thunder team, Assistant Coach to Nick Poole at Lightning and then Head Coach at Thunder. However, before the commencement of the season, preparations were thrown into disarray with revelations of unpaid wages/reimbursements for both former players and off ice staff, outstanding debts to suppliers and poor stewardship by the owners. This led to the majority of the clubs sponsors publicly denouncing the situation and declining to provide further support.\n\nThe rink operators Planet Ice also decided not to award the ice contract for the 2019–2020 season to Graham and Monica Moody but to the Supporters-based consortium formally known as the Milton Keynes Ice Hockey Club and colloquially as 'Lets Play Hockey' for them to ice a team in the NIHL National League. This consortium had been set up after the announcement that Milton Keynes Lightning would no longer ice in the Elite League and had, with the backing of Planet Ice unsuccessfully applied to operate a Milton Keynes Elite League franchise for the 2019–20 season. Shortly after the announcement, the English Ice Hockey Association confirmed that the team under the management of the Lets Play Hockey consortium had been accepted into the new NIHL National League. Once confirmation of the league place had been made, clarification was provided that Lewis Clifford would continue to be the coach under the new ownership regime. The new owners also confirmed that the team would continue using the Milton Keynes Lightning name. The 2019/20 season ended prematurely due to the Covid-19 pandemic with the team sitting in sixth position.\n\nIn March 2013, Milton Keynes Council approved plans to redevelop the Leisure Plaza after failed attempts in 2006 & 2011. The development of the arena was funded by Morrisons Supermarkets and took 17 months to complete. This forced Lightning to play their home games at the Coventry Sky Dome during the 2013/2014 season & part of the 2014/2015 season. The team returned to the redeveloped rink which had been renamed the \"MK Arena\" on 18 October 2014 against Sheffield Steeldogs, in front of a sell out crowd in excess of 2,500.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As of December 2018, all former locations have been closed.\n\nJillian's was founded in 1985 as a billiards club located near Fenway Park in Boston by Stephen Foster. The club was named after a woman named Jillian Foster, who is the spouse of the establishment's founder. The couple later founded the chain Lucky Strike Lanes. Within several years, the owners opened another branch in Seattle. By the early 1990s, it had become a competitor of Dave & Buster's, expanding its locations to include restaurants, video game arcades, bowling alleys, nightclubs, and conference rooms. By 2000, there were roughly 30 locations in the U.S. and one in Montréal, Canada. \n\nIn August 2001, the LA area Jillian's was seen on GSN as Jeffrey Ross hosted in between episode spots for one week during GSN's Let's Make a Deal-a-thon, the week GSN started airing LMAD reruns. In 2004, Jillian's Entertainment Holdings, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and arranged to sell its assets. Nine of the Jillian's locations and the Jillian's tradename were sold to Dave & Buster's. At least some of these locations were eventually converted to operation under the Dave & Buster's name, and some were rebranded as \"Dave & Buster's Grand Sports Cafe\". In 2009, D&B, which itself was going through the process of being sold from one venture capital firm to another, sold the rights to the name to Gemini Investors. That company later established JBC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. to operate these locations.\n\nMany of the locations no longer exist: the location at Neonopolis in downtown Las Vegas (which closed in 2008 after also being used as a concert venue) and the location at Peabody Place in Memphis, Tennessee, which shut down in 2009, and the Jillians of Youngstown, Ohio at the Southern Park Mall was closed down on January 30, 2011 but for reasons unknown of the old Woolworth building. The location in Charlotte, North Carolina closed down in February 2010. The Cleveland Heights, Ohio location also closed on February 20, 2011 and was converted into Myxx, a tapas bar, by its owner. The location in Seattle was closed in 2012. The location in Peoria, Illinois closed May 2013. The location in Chesapeake, Virginia was closed July 28, 2014, then reopened as GameWorks on August 1, 2014. On January 6, 2016, Inside Universal reported that the Jillian's Hi-Life Lanes location in Universal City has closed its doors and will be replaced by Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville. In 2017, the Worcester, Massachusetts location closed, and the original Jillian's in Boston was converted into Lucky Strike Social, even though it kept the Jillian's branding. In 2018, the San Francisco Jillian's was converted into Tabletop Tap House, a hipster-styled similar joint.\n\n"}

It is the district capital of Mpwapwa District. According to the 2012 Tanzania National Census, the population of Mpwapwa (Mpwapwa Mjini ward) was 21,337.\n\nIt is one of the oldest colonial districts in Tanzania, boasting local German colonial government headquarters, or \"bomas\", in the early 1890s, and British administrative offices after World War I. It has long been an important educational town, with the oldest teachers' training college in Tanzania (Mpwapwa TTC) and a secondary school dating back to the turn of the century that was originally called the central primary school. This was the only school for local residents who would form the work force for the colonial administration. The school was renovated during colonial rule to become a secondary school for boys. The school had the first African secondary school headmaster in the country, Mr Matthew Ramadhani, a Zanzibari, who died in an underground (subway) accident in the UK while on a study tour. Mpwapwa had one of the oldest veterinary research institutes in Tanzania, at Kikombo, which was later moved to Temeke in Dar es Salaam in the late 1950s. Mpwapwa was a resting post for the reporter/explorer Henry Morton Stanley, where he is believed to have etched a note (in remembrance of W. L. Farquhar) on a rock that is still present near the Anglican missionary Cathedral (All Saints') at Ving'hawe. The district is populated by the Gogo (ethnic group) ethnic group in the center and north, and the Hehe ethnic group in the south bordering Iringa region. It is located at , with a population of about 40,000 serving an area about the size of Wales. \n\nWhile traditional ways abound with the fabric of society still enriched by a strong embodiment of the predominant Gogo culture, the district is pretty cosmopolitan in its population. Several tribes have made Mpwapwa their home, like the Bena, Nyasa and a few Chaga. The south is populated by the Hehe and the eastern region by the Kaguru.\n\nMpwapwa is a fairly mountainous area and takes many hours to travel by car from north to south along the dirt roads that serve the district. The one-time well-kept main road north from Mpwapwa town to Kongwa eventually links to the tarmac road that connects Dar es Salaam to Dodoma. The central line, the railroad from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma and western Tanzania passes directly through Mpwapwa District, at Gulwe station approximately 12 miles south of Mpwapwa town. On June 24, 2002, the Igandu train disaster occurred along the central line at Igandu station close to Dodoma town when a runaway passenger train with over 1,200 people on board rolled downhill into a stationary goods train, killing 281 people, the worst railroad accident in Tanzanian history; many of the injured were treated at the small district hospital in Mpwapwa town. This hospital was opened in 1964 at the behest of the first member of parliament, Ali Saidi Mtaki. He was instrumental in rebuilding the current downtown shortly before independence. Kongwa, a nearby town, had all the amenities left behind after the failed groundnuts scheme in the late forties and early fifties. During the project, Kongwa had a robust European community with schools and paved roads, the remnants of which can be seen in Kongwa today. After independence, Mtaki managed to bring the main electrical power station to Mpwapwa and the current hospital. The hospital was opened in 1964 by Saidi Maswanya, who was then minister of health.\n"}

It is approximately south of Denali, the highest peak in North America. \"Begguya\" means child (of Denali) in the Dena'ina language. Mount Hunter is the third-highest major peak in the Alaska Range.\n\nMount Hunter has a complex structure: it is topped by a large, low-angled glacier plateau, connecting the North (Main) Summit and the South Summit (). Long, corniced ridges extend in various directions; between them are exceptionally steep faces.\n\nThe native name for the mountain is Begguya, meaning \"Denali's Child\". Early prospectors referred to the mountain as Mount Roosevelt. In 1903, Robert Dunn, a reporter for the \"New York Commercial Advertiser\", visited the area as part of Frederick Cook's attempt to climb Mount McKinley. He bestowed the name of his aunt Anna Falconnet Hunter (1885–1941), who financed his trip, on a high nearby mountain, prominent from the northwest. This was, in fact, a different peak, now known as Kahiltna Dome. The name Hunter was mistakenly applied to the present-day Mount Hunter by a government surveyor in 1906.\n\nIn October 2010, the South Summit was named Mount Stevens, after Ted Stevens (1923–2010), a former senator of Alaska.\n\nDespite being much lower in elevation than Denali (formerly Mount McKinley), Mount Hunter is a more difficult climb, due to its steep faces and corniced ridges; it also sees far less traffic than its larger neighbor.\n\nFred Beckey, Heinrich Harrer and Henry Meybohm completed the first ascent in 1954, via the long West Ridge; this was a great accomplishment for the time, and used techniques such as extensive front-pointing which were unusual in the climbing world.\n\nBeginning in 1977, with Michael Kennedy and George Lowe's climb of a route on the northwest face of Mount Hunter, this steep rock and ice face has been the scene of many landmark hard climbs.\n\n\n\n"}

This single is the fourth and last single released from the band's second album, \"The Cross of Changes\". The single cover art is a simplified version of \"The Cross of Changes\".\n\nThe song employs a more traditional rock format compared to Enigma's hallmark electronica sound. The song contains a sample from A Positive Life's \"The Calling\". Michael Cretu provides vocals here.\n\nThe lyrics of the second verse are the same as the ones of The Cross of Changes' opening track \"Second Chapter\".\n\nThe video was shot and produced in London; diving equipment supply, supervision and dressing was provided by Michael Last and Jeff Grey.\n\nIn the music video for the song, helmed by Venezuelan director Angel Gracia (who, in tandem with Cliff Guest, won MTV's Make My Video competition for Madonna's \"True Blue\" song in 1986), a diver comes upon an Atlantis-like submerged ancient city (underscored by sound effects resembling a sonar's echo) and takes a tour around the city, similar to the video clip for \"Sadeness (Part I)\". Soon he realizes he can breathe without the scaphander, and is attracted by a series of lively murals (paintings or mosaics) combining Pompeii and Byzantine features. Eventually driven to try to make contact with a woman of strange beauty, as their fingertips touch, all the figures come alive resuming what presumably were their last actions. But so does the being responsible for the city's doom - a Poseidon reminiscent of the Sistine Chapel's angry Jehovah - reenacting the catastrophe and the spell. All of the newly liberated beings return to their mural condition. Sadly enough, the spell also befalls the diver - which admits, however, a glimpse of hope: the figures are now in slightly different positions as a consequence of their progress during their brief period of freedom, and the intrepid diver has left his imperishable mark, as a mural in his likeness - the background music featuring, for a last time, the chorus: \"That's why we are here\".\n\n"}

It joins rail services from south of Dublin to Connolly Station and lines north. \n\nDesigned by John Chaloner Smith (engineer to the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway), the bridge was built between 1889 and 1891. It consists of wrought iron lattice girders on a double row of piers with five spans. The viaduct is approximately six metres above street level and supports two railway tracks.\n\nDuring original planning and construction (in the late 19th century) the project was subject to much opposition and controversy, because the structure blocks the view down river to The Custom House. However, the bridge was deemed necessary as a rail link between north and south Dublin, and to facilitate the movement of transatlantic mail coming from Kingstown (Dún Laoghaire) and Queenstown (Cobh).\n\n100 years later, the visage of the bridge remains the subject of some debate. Already arguably less attractive than some of Dublin's other bridges, the façades of the Loopline have been used by Iarnród Éireann for billboard advertising. , the company has scaled back the bridge's use for this purpose to reduce impact on the city skyline, following input from An Bord Pleanála and Dublin City Council.\n\nA prominent feature in the city landscape since 1891, the Loopline Bridge appears in one of the most famous literary works associated with Dublin:\n"}

According to Amnesty International, most of women are trafficked from Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine.\n\nIn the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report, Kosovo was identified as transit and destination country for woman and children, victims of the human trafficking, especially the forced prostitution.\n\nHuman trafficking in Kosovo has seen \"a steep rise\" since NATO troops and UN administrators took over Kosovo. According to Amnesty International, NATO servicemen and UN staff \"generate 80% of the income\" for pimps and human traffickers. UN Department of peacekeeping claimed that \"peacekeepers have come to be seen as part of the problem in trafficking rather than the solution\".

He is best known as the drummer for the British rock band Motörhead from 1991 until the band disbanded in December 2015, due to the death of founder and frontman Lemmy. Dee is currently the drummer for the German rock band Scorpions with whom he became a permanent band member in September 2016.\n\nDee was born in Gothenburg, Sweden, to a Greek father and a Swedish mother.\n\nHe began his musical career with local bands Nadir and Geisha. His favourite drummer is Ian Paice. Other influences include Brian Downey, Neil Peart and Steve Smith. Dee also gives credit to Buddy Rich.\n\nHaving moved to Copenhagen to play with Geisha, in 1985 Dee joined King Diamond who were looking for additional members to complete their line-up. Dee played on the King Diamond recordings \"Fatal Portrait\" (1986), \"Abigail\" (1987), and \"\"Them\"\" which followed in 1988. King Diamond himself was becoming quite popular and the musicians backing him were taking a secondary role in the writing and decision making, often Diamond was the only person answering for the whole group in magazine interviews, etc. After the completion of the supporting tour for \"Them\", Mikkey Dee decided to leave the band, as he felt he was becoming more of a back-up musician, rather than an equal contributing songwriter. However, he was rehired to play session drums for the recording of the band's follow-up album Conspiracy (1989), after which he was replaced by Snowy Shaw.\n\nHe joined Don Dokken for his solo album, \"Up from the Ashes\" (1990), with the music videos for the songs \"Stay\" and \"Mirror Mirror\" receiving airplay on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. The band headlined their own tour, as well as opened for Judas Priest. During this time, Dee also filled in a short time playing for World War Three (WWIII).\n\nWhile King Diamond was touring with Motörhead, Lemmy repeatedly asked Dee to join his band. In 1992 Dee accepted, replacing Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor. On his replacement of a longstanding member, Dee said in 2006:\n\nPhil Taylor was great when he was good... so I could never have filled that space. It's like when you get married and have kids; no one can take my father's place… I could never be Phil Taylor, so I had to introduce Mikkey Dee into Motörhead.\n\nDee's first gig with the band was on 30 August 1992 at Saratoga Performing Arts Center in New York, but he did not have much input on that year's \"March or Die\" as this had been recorded with Tommy Aldridge prior to Dee joining. He played on the albums \"Hellraiser\" and \"Hell on Earth\", from the soundtrack for \"\".\n\nAlthough Aldridge recorded most of the drum tracks, Dee's photo appeared on the rear album sleeve. Aldridge said that Dee could take credit for the playing, but Dee declined, as their styles are very different.\nEpic Records dropped the band after its release and the group continued recording with SPV GmbH. The band also started a label called \"Motörhead\", which was copyrighted and distributed through Warner-Chappell and ZYX, Dee's first album for this label being 1993's \"Bastards\".\n\nDee also played drums on Helloween's 2003 album \"Rabbit Don't Come Easy\", stepping in for Mark Cross.\n\nIn April 2006 King Diamond reunited with Dee at a sold-out gig at Kåren in Gothenburg, Sweden. In 2001 King referred to Dee as \"one of the best [drummers] of all time and that's something that has bothered us since he left.\"\n\nDee played the drums for Martin \"E-Type\" Eriksson in the Swedish pre-qualification to the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, as well as on E-Type's 2003 Eurometal tour.\n\nDee is famous for lengthy drum solos, often lasting between five and fifteen minutes. These appeared halfway through \"Sacrifice\", then \"In the Name of Tragedy\" and latterly \"The One to Sing the Blues\".\n\nDee is an ice hockey fan and a supporter of the Frölunda HC team from Gothenburg. The rumour that Dee was in a Swedish National Youth Hockey team (stemming from an interview on Motörhead's \"Stage Fright\" DVD) has been rebutted by Dee himself, who attributed it to, \"In the end of the 80s and a bit into the 90s, I played for a team called Team Sweden in southern California.\" \n\nA contestant on series 1 of \"Kändisdjungeln\" on TV4 in 2009, Dee was eliminated in the 15th episode. His place was filled on a US tour by Matt Sorum, who said, \"I thought either Mikkey would die in the jungle or I would die on the Motörhead tour.\"\n\nOn 29 December 2015, following Lemmy's death a day earlier, Dee announced that Motörhead had disbanded.\n\nIn January 2016, Dee joined Thin Lizzy to play on their anniversary shows. However, on 19 April it was announced that Dee would not be participating. On 28 April 2016, it was announced that Dee would be filling in for James Kottak with the Scorpions on 12 North American headlining dates, including a run of shows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas dubbed \"Scorpions blacked out in Las Vegas\". On 12 September 2016, Dee joined the band permanently.\n\nDee uses Sonor drums, Paiste cymbals, Evans drumheads, and Wincent Drums sticks. He was endorsed by Vic Firth, but recently switched to Wincent, with whom he has his own signature model. He also used Remo heads in the past. His main kit is a Sonor SQ2 Vintage Maple Custom Finish set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181011", "title": "Practice chanter", "text": "Practice chanter\n\nA bagpipe practice chanter is a double-reed woodwind instrument, principally used as an adjunct to the Great Highland bagpipe. As its name implies, the practice chanter serves as a practice instrument: firstly for learning to finger the different melody notes of bagpipe music, and (after a player masters the bagpipes) to practice new music. \n\nThe practice chanter is essentially a long, thin piece of wood or plastic (in two parts) with a small-diameter hole bored lengthwise through the centre. Air is directed into and through this bore hole and passes through a reed, the vibration of which causes the sound. On the lower portion of the chanter, holes are bored into the instrument at right angles to the central bore hole. These holes are then covered or uncovered to produce the melody.\n\nPractice chanters can be made out of various materials and come in various sizes: short chanters are designed for the smaller hands of a child; regular chanters (as shown in the photo at right) are the same size is the traditional chanters; long chanters are also available, with the added length allowing a melody hole spacing identical to that of the bagpipe chanter itself. On some long chanters, the melody holes are also countersunk so that the outside face of the melody holes will have the same diameter as the bagpipe chanter holes.\n\nPipe Chanters and practice chanters are typically made out of a hard wood such as African Blackwood; before the expansion of the British Empire, native woods were used, and are still used in many folk instruments. In the 1960s African Blackwood was in very short supply, and Ireland's only bagpipe maker, Andrew Warnock of The Pipers Cave in Northern Ireland, began making chanters from polyoxymethylene (also known by several names), an extremely strong and durable machinable plastic which at the time was used for making police batons. The Gibson and Dunbar chanters are made out of polyoxymethylene. It is a material that can be machined and polished much like soft metals. Since there is no danger of splitting with a plastic chanter, there is no need for a sole (see below), although some models retain it for decorative purposes.\n\nThe practice chanter can be played either sitting or standing.\n\nThe practice chanter consists of a top section with mouthpiece, a lower portion with finger holes, and a reed. \n\nThe top section consists of the mouthpiece (the uppermost portion) and the reed cover (the thicker portion). The player blows into the mouthpiece. It can be made of nylon, wood, or plastic. The reed cover channels the air over the reed causing it to vibrate and produce the sound. The ring at the base of the reed cover is a ferrule, and is purely decorative. It can be made out of ivory, imitation ivory, plastic, nylon, or a metal such as silver.\n\nThe reed can be made of cane or plastic. The two blades of the double reed vibrate against one another when air passes over them, and the sound is channeled down into and through the bottom section of the chanter. \n\nThe bottom section of the chanter is the portion which produces the melody which results from the covering and uncovering of small holes drilled into the core of the chanter at precisely determined intervals. The top of this section is the stock into which the reed is inserted. The stock is tightly fitted into the top section of the practice chanter, and is usually wrapped with hemp, plumbers tape, etc. to ensure an airtight seal. The base of the bottom section may contain another ring called the sole. On a wooden chanter the sole keeps the wood from splitting. With the advent of plastic chanters, \"sole-less\" designers are more common.\n\nThe practice chanter is, as the name implies, used to practice playing the bagpipes in place of the full instrument. The practice chanter is significantly quieter and better suited for the indoors, and requires less blowing than the bagpipes, making it physically easier to play.\n\nIn Gaelic-speaking areas of Scotland, musicians traditionally constructed their own practice chanters out of reed (Scottish Gaelic: \"cuilc\") and barley (Scottish Gaelic: \"eòrna\") stalks. The reed was hollowed out with a wire heated over a peat fire, and holes were burned in the reed in the same way, to form the body of the chanter. A short piece of barley stalk was then shaped in the mouth to function as a sounding reed. These home-made chanters were called \"feadanan Gàidhealach\" (Highland or Gaelic chanters; singular, \"feadan Gàidhealach\") and were distinguished from manufactured practice chanters as \"feadanan Gallda\" (foreign chanters). The sound of the \"feadan Gàidhealach\" is quite sweet and it appears that these homemade chanters were not just used for practice, but considered a proper instrument in their own right and played in traditional house cèilidhs in the Western Isles of Scotland.\n\n"}

{"id": "2181020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181020", "title": "New York Cancer Hospital", "text": "New York Cancer Hospital\n\nThe New York Cancer Hospital (NYCH) in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City was a cancer treatment and research institution founded in 1884. The building was located at 455 Central Park West between West 105th and 106th Streets, and built between 1884 and 1886 with additions made between 1889 and 1890; it was designed by Charles Coolidge Haight in the Late Gothic and French Chateau styles – inspired by the chateaux of the Loire Valley. It was the first hospital in the United States dedicated specifically for the treatment of cancer, and the second in the world after the London Cancer Hospital. After outgrowing the original building and moving, it became what is today known as Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nAround 1955, the hospital became Towers Nursing Home, and the building began its decline. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1976, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and was converted into luxury condominium apartments in 2001-05 designed by Perkins Eastman Architects.\n\n\"In the summer of 1884, former President Ulysses S. Grant developed throat cancer. He lived in a brownstone at 3 East 66th Street, and his ensuing decline caught the attention of the nation. Considered incurable, as well as contagious and shameful, Grant's death the following year brought awareness of the disease. Although his cancer was inoperable, others were more fortunate, since the development of anesthesia in the mid-19th century had finally given doctors a surgical treatment for cancer.\n\nIn the year of Grant's diagnosis, John Jacob Astor III, Elizabeth H. Cullum, John E. Parsons, Thomas A. Emmet, Joseph W. Drexel and other prominent New Yorkers laid the cornerstone for the New York Cancer Hospital, the country's first to devote itself exclusively to the care of cancer patients. Designed by Charles C. Haight and completed in 1887, the first portion of the hospital, designated solely for women, was at the southwest corner of 106th and Central Park West. At the dedication, Grant's physician, Fordyce Barker, said that cancer was \"not due to misery, to poverty, or bad sanitary surroundings, or to ignorance or to bad habits, but a disease afflicting the cultured, the wealthy and the inhabitants of salubrious localities.\"\"\n\nIn 1890 the hospital was expanded south, and in both sections Haight designed circular wards, about in diameter, in part to facilitate better observation by a nurse at a central desk and in part because the design offered more space between the heads of the beds. Ventilation was a key concern, so a duct ran up the centers of the wards to remove what was said to be \"intense odors\" caused by the disease. Haight worked the round wards into the exterior architecture, which he executed in deep red brick and soft brown Belleville brownstone, with great conical towers irregularly placed on the three fronts.\n\nThe big, broad towers gave the hospital the character of a French château, like the Château de Chambord at Chambord, Loir-et-Cher, France, and made it one of the most important pieces of institutional architecture in New York even until today. It is widely said it \"would much more readily be taken for an art museum than for a hospital.\"\n\nDuring the hospital's inauguration, treatment for cancer was mostly palliative. The hospital offered what was considered the best treatments available for that time. Cancer treatment then meant, at best, easing pain and making the sufferer as comfortable as possible. Many patients came to the New York Cancer Hospital, in effect, to die, assuaged by morphine. Other forms of relief included carriage rides in Central Park and Sunday services in the hospital's Chapel of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, patron saint of the suffering.\n\nFrom its beginnings, the NYCH seemed fraught with misfortune. Just months after laying the cornerstone to the new hospital, one of its primary benefactors, Elizabeth Hamilton Cullum, succumbed to uterine cancer. Coincidentally, John Jacob Astor's wife, Charlotte Augusta Astor also died of uterine cancer just a week shy of the hospital's grand opening in December 1887, missing her chance to be presumably cured. Due in part to his generous financial contributions to the facility, the New York Cancer Hospital's first wing was appropriately dedicated the \"Astor Pavilion\".\n\nInspired as much by modern medical theory as by 16th-century French châteaux, the architect Charles Haight's round towers were designed to deter germs and dirt from accumulating in sharp corners, which at the time was considered a harboring ground for disease. An air shaft ran vertically through the center of each tower to prevent air from stagnating in the wards. This design was considered the very latest in 19th-century ventilation technology: The New York Times commented in 1888 that \"altogether, the[se] features marked a new departure in hospital construction and make this admirable structure a model of its kind.\"\n\nThe 20th century brought new techniques in cancer treatment, including radiation therapy. In 1921, Marie Curie visited the New York Cancer Hospital, by then renamed the General Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases, to see the brick and steel vault where the hospital kept its four grams of radium—at the time the largest accumulation in the world. Dr. Edward H. Rogers, who was escorting her, assured The Times that \"there is no case on record of anyone being injured in health by radium.\" He denied that Curie had been harmed by the radioactive material, saying she had been ill recently only from anemia. In this period the hazards of radium were beginning to emerge, sparking defensive claims by its proponents. She died in 1934, unsurprisingly due to radium poisoning. In retrospect, early radiation treatments were often worse than the disease they were meant to cure. Radiation caused severe burns and, in some cases, additional cancers. New York Cancer Hospital may have been hailed a success for its good intentions, but there was no end to the suffering of those within. Plagued by the growing death rate, the NYCH had its own crematorium located in the basement of the facility, all the more dreadful by the vision, through its gothic windows, of the tall smokestack to the west of the main building.\n\nLargely because cancer remained so deadly, the hospital soon ran into financial troubles. It came to be known as \"the Bastille,\" a place to be feared and avoided by patients and patrons. At the turn of the century, administrators of the beleaguered hospital changed its name to the General Memorial Hospital, and again in the early 1920s to the General Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases. Through the decades, the hospital endured its arduous dedication for its principle grounds of finding a cure for cancer.\n\nIn 1955, the General Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases moved out of the outdated Central Park West facility to its new location on the East Side. There it grew to become what is present day Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. It was during this time that the former New York Cancer Hospital building began its decline. Under the new ownership of nursing home magnate Bernard Bergman, it was turned into a facility called Towers Nursing Home. The nursing home later became infamous for its negligence and lack of standards. The elderly patients testified to \"atrocious conditions,\" including inadequate heat, pest infestations, physical abuse and negligence. The patients weren't the only ones being neglected either. The old facilities were unkempt, filthy, and a \"pungent odor\" filled the air. The once immaculate building became a sad derelict place. A state and federal investigation ensued following a probe into allegations of Medicaid and tax fraud that ultimately caused the home to close its doors in 1974. The former New York Cancer Hospital was left in such a disastrous condition following the closure of the nursing home that there were talks of demolition before the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the hospital building a historic landmark in 1976.\n\nThe medical hospital, neglected, lay overgrown and vandalized for many decades. In the neighborhood the building become popularly known as \"the castle\" due to its gothic round towers. Through the years, many promising developers expressed interest in the decaying property. Among some of them were hotelier and real-estate developer Ian Schrager, best known as part owner of Studio 54, whose attempt to renovate the landmark into luxury apartments failed. The old hospital lay abandoned for nearly three decades until March 2000, when the Chicago-based developer MCL Companies became involved. With generous financing, Daniel E. McLean, president and chief executive of the MCL Companies bought the property for $21 million and began construction. But like numerous predecessors he was forced to halt the work due to financial holdups following the September 11 attacks. McLean envisioned a plan that called for massive renovation of the old hospital remnant into modern luxury condominiums, including a new modern 26-story tower adjacent to the landmark building. Among the new tenants would be Columbia University, who bought several entire floors to use as residence to house senior faculty and visiting dignitaries. The purchase by Columbia, as well as a new construction loan, allowed McLean's project to get back on track after work was halted due to lack of money following 9/11.\n\nBy early 2005, conversion of the old landmark hospital into condominiums, now called 455 Central Park West, was completed, with units selling for as much as $7 million. The new apartments in the old hospital building highlight its distinct features, most notably cavernous circular rooms with lofty ceilings, while those in the new tower have splendid views overlooking Central Park. Tenants enjoy such amenities as a spa, indoor pool, and 24-hour concierge service. The building was, even then, reputed to be haunted.\n\n\n"}

Metzger\n\nBruce Manning Metzger (1914–2007) was an American biblical scholar, Bible translator and textual critic who was a longtime professor at Princeton Theological Seminary and Bible editor who served on the board of the American Bible Society and United Bible Societies. He was a scholar of Greek, New Testament, and New Testament textual criticism, and wrote prolifically on these subjects. Metzger was one of the most influential New Testament scholars of the 20th century.\n\nMetzger was born on February 9, 1914, in Middletown, Pennsylvania, and earned his BA (1935) at Lebanon Valley College. Metzger had strong academic training in Greek before enrolling in Princeton Seminary, and in the summer prior to entering the Seminary, he completed reading through the entire Bible consecutively for the twelfth time. He received his ThB in 1938 at Princeton Theological Seminary, and in the autumn of 1938 began teaching at Princeton as a Teaching Fellow in New Testament Greek. On April 11, 1939, he was ordained in the United Presbyterian Church of North America, which has since merged and is now known as the Presbyterian Church (USA). In 1940, he earned his MA from Princeton University and became an instructor in New Testament. Two years later, he earned his PhD (\"Studies in a Greek Gospel Lectionary (Greg. 303)\"), also from Princeton University.\n\nIn 1944, Metzger married Isobel Elizabeth Mackay, daughter of the third president of the Seminary, John A. Mackay. That year, he was promoted to Assistant Professor. In 1948, he became Associate Professor, and full Professor in 1954. In 1964, Metzger was named the George L. Collord Professor of New Testament Language and Literature. In 1971, he was elected president of both the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas and the Society of Biblical Literature. The following year, he became president of the North American Patristic Society. Metzger was visiting fellow at Clare Hall, Cambridge in 1974 and Wolfson College, Oxford in 1979. In 1978 he was elected corresponding fellow of the British Academy, the Academy's highest distinction for persons who are not residents in the United Kingdom. At the age of seventy, after teaching at Princeton Theological Seminary for a period of forty-six years, he retired as Professor Emeritus. In 1994, Bruce Metzger was honoured with the Burkitt Medal for Biblical Studies by the British Academy. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Lebanon Valley College, the Findlay College, the University of St Andrews, the University of Münster and Potchefstroom University. \"Metzger's unrivaled knowledge of the relevant languages, ancient and modern; his balanced judgment; and his painstaking attention to detail won him respect across the theological and academic spectrum.\" Conservative evangelical scholar Daniel B. Wallace described Metzger as \"a fine, godly, conservative scholar, although his view of biblical authority is not quite the same as many other evangelicals.\"\n\nShortly after his 93rd birthday, Metzger died in Princeton, New Jersey, on February 13, 2007. He was survived by his wife Isobel and their two sons, John Mackay Metzger and James Bruce Metzger.\n\nMetzger edited and provided commentary for many Bible translations and wrote dozens of books. He was an editor of the United Bible Societies' standard Greek New Testament, the starting point for nearly all recent New Testament translations. In 1952, he became a contributor to the Revised Standard Version (RSV) of the Bible, and was general editor of the \"Reader's Digest Bible\" (a condensed version of the RSV) in 1982. From 1977 to 1990, he chaired the Committee on Translators for the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) of the Bible and was \"largely responsible for ... seeing [the NRSV] through the press.\" He considered it a privilege to present the NRSV—which includes the books referred to as Apocrypha by Protestants, though Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox consider them deuterocanonical—to Pope John Paul II and Patriarch Demetrius I of Constantinople.\n\nCentral to his scholarly contribution to New Testament studies is his trilogy: \"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration\" (1964; 2nd ed., 1968; 3d enlarged ed., 1992); \"The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission, and Limitations\" (1977); \"The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance\" (1987). The first volume of a series that he founded and edited, \"New Testament Tools and Studies,\" appeared in 1960.\n\nMetzger's commentaries often utilize historical criticism and higher criticism, which attempt to explain the literary and historical origins of the Bible and the biblical canon. For instance, Metzger argues that the early church which assembled the New Testament did not consider divine inspiration to be a sufficient criterion for a book to be placed in the canon. Metzger says that the early church saw it as very important that a work describing Jesus' life be written by a follower of or an eyewitness to Jesus, and considered other works such as \"The Shepherd\" of Hermas and the \"Epistles of Clement\" to be inspired but not canonical.\n\nIn discussing the canon, Metzger identifies three criteria “for acceptance of particular writings as sacred, authoritative, and worthy of being read in services of worship…”, criteria which were “generally adopted during the course of the second century, and were never modified thereafter”, namely, orthodoxy (conformity to the rule of faith), apostolicity, and consensus among the churches. He concludes that, “In the most basic sense neither individuals nor councils created the canon; instead they came to recognize and acknowledge the self-authenticating quality of these writings, which imposed themselves as canonical upon the church.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181036", "title": "National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena", "text": "National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena\n\nThe National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) was an unidentified flying object (UFO) research group most active in the United States from the 1950s to the 1980s. It remains active primarily as an informational depository on the UFO phenomenon.\n\nThough NICAP was a non-profit organization, the group faced financial collapse many times in its existence, due in no small part to business ineptitude among the group's directors. Following a wave of nationally publicized UFO incidents in the mid-1960s, NICAP's membership spiked dramatically, and only then did the organization become financially stable. However, following publication of the Condon Report in 1968, NICAP's membership declined sharply, and the organization again fell into long-term financial decline and disarray.\n\nDespite these internal troubles, NICAP probably had the most visibility of any civilian American UFO group, and arguably had the most mainstream respectability; Jerome Clark writes that \"for many middle-class Americans and others interested in UFOs but repelled by ufology’s fringe aspects, it served as a sober forum for UFO reporting, inquiry, investigation, and speculation\". NICAP advocated transparent scientific investigation of UFO sightings and was skeptical of \"contactee\" tales involving meetings with space visitors, the alien abduction phenomenon, and the like. The presence of several prominent military officials as members of NICAP brought a further measure of respectability for many observers.\n\nThroughout its existence, NICAP argued that there was an organized governmental cover-up of UFO evidence. NICAP also pushed for governmental hearings regarding UFOs, with occasional success.\n\nThough any UFO-related group attracts a number of uncritical enthusiasts along with a small percentage of cranks, astronomer J. Allen Hynek cited NICAP and Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) as the two best civilian UFO groups of their time, consisting largely of sober, serious-minded people capable of valuable contributions to the subject.\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, NICAP gave little attention to close encounters of the third kind (where animated beings are purportedly sighted in relation to a UFO). However, longtime NICAP member Richard H. Hall related privately that this position was \"tactical and not doctrinaire.\" In other words, NICAP did not necessarily dismiss occupant reports out of hand, but elected to focus on other aspects of the UFO phenomenon which would be perceived by mainstream observers as less outlandish. The attention given to the contactees of the 1950s (who typically claimed ongoing contact with benevolent \"Space Brothers\") was almost certainly a factor in NICAP's reluctance to study UFO occupant reports too closely. But with the 1964 Lonnie Zamora UFO encounter — regarded by researchers as one of the most reliable UFO occupant reports — NICAP loosened its restrictions on studying UFO occupant reports.\n\nNICAP was founded on October 24, 1956, by inventor Thomas Townsend Brown. The board of governors included several prominent men, including Donald Keyhoe, Maj USMC (Ret.), and former chief of the Navy's guided missile program RADM Delmer S. Fahrney USN (Ret.)\n\nBy early January 1957, however, Brown had proved so financially inept that the board asked him to step down. Fahrney replaced him, then convened a press conference on January 16, 1957, where he announced that UFOs were under intelligent control, but that they were of neither American or Soviet origin. The press conference received major attention, doubtless aided by Fahrney's stature.\n\nIn April 1957, Fahrney resigned from NICAP, citing personal issues. It was later disclosed that his wife was seriously ill. Fahrney was bothered by the whispers and ridicule his UFO interests generated among many of his peers in the military.\n\nKeyhoe became NICAP's director. He established a monthly newsletter, \"The U.F.O. Investigator\". Another prominent figure joined NICAP's board of governors: Keyhoe's Naval Academy classmate VADM Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, USN (Ret.) He had been Director of Central Intelligence and first head of the Central Intelligence Agency. Another important name on the letterhead was that of Gen. Albert Coady Wedemeyer USA (Ret.)\n\nThe organization had chapters and local associates scattered throughout the United States. Many of their members were amateurs, but a considerable percentage were professionals, including journalists, military personnel, scientists and physicians. One of NICAP's prime goals was thorough field investigations of UFO reports. They would eventually compile a significant number of case files and field investigations which Clark characterises as \"often first rate\".\n\nBy 1958, NICAP had grown to over 5000 members. Keyhoe's financial management and business skills were only slightly better than Brown's, and NICAP hobbled along throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, facing collapse on several occasions. For most of his tenure as director, Keyhoe sent irregular letters to NICAP's members, warning of the organization's imminent collapse, and soliciting funds to keep NICAP going. According to Jerome Clark (see sources below), Keyhoe often paid for much of NICAP's operating expenses himself.\n\nThe 1960s found much of the American public keenly interested in UFOs, and NICAP's membership crested at 14,000. This influx of members greatly improved the group's finances.\n\nHillenkoetter left the board in 1962.\n\nIn 1964, NICAP published \"The UFO Evidence\", edited by Richard H. Hall, a summary of hundreds of unexplained reports studied by NICAP investigators through 1963. Sightings were systematically broken down by witness category and special types of evidence. For example, individual chapters were devoted to sightings by military personnel, pilots and aviation experts, and scientists and engineers. Another chapter was devoted to evidence of intelligent control and yet another to physical evidence or interactions, such as electromagnetic effects, radar tracking, photographs, sound, physiological effects, and so on. Another section examined observed patterns, such as descriptions of shape, color, maneuvers, flight behavior, and concentrations of sightings. The book is still considered an invaluable reference source in the field.\n\nWhen the United States Air Force, in collaboration with the University of Colorado, established the Condon Committee (1966–68) to study UFOs, NICAP initially aided its investigations, but Keyhoe quickly became disenchanted, limiting NICAP's role. NICAP formally severed ties with the Condon Committee in early 1968. Following the Condon Committee's report (which concluded there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs), public interest in the subject abated, and NICAP's membership dropped to about 5000.\n\n1969 saw the last NICAP efforts of any significance, two monographs: \"Strange Effects from UFOs\" and \"UFOs: A New Look\".\n\nNICAP's membership plummeted in the late 1960s, and Keyhoe faced charges of financial incompetence and authoritarianism. By 1969, Keyhoe turned his focus away from the military and focused on the CIA as the source of the UFO cover up. By December 1969, NICAP's board, headed by Colonel Joseph Bryan III, forced Keyhoe to retire as NICAP chief. Under Bryan's leadership, NICAP disbanded its local and state affiliate groups . Afterwards, John L. Acuff became NICAP's director.\n\nNICAP's membership continued to drop as it was led by Acuff and then Alan Hall. By now, the organization was all but paralyzed by infighting, including unsubstantiated charges that the Central Intelligence Agency had infiltrated NICAP. In fact, several persons with CIA ties had joined NICAP; however, their motives and reasons for joining NICAP have been the subject of some debate.\n\nOne person specifically named as a suspected CIA infiltrator was retired Air Force Colonel Joseph Bryan III. His son, writer C. D. B. Bryan, dismisses this idea, suggesting that \"Anyone who knows anything about the history of NICAP knows that the group didn’t need \"anybody's\" help in its disintegration; it simply self-destructed.\" As to his father's involvement as an alleged CIA agitator, Bryan writes, \"my father’s unswerving, outspoken faith in UFOs ... was, I felt, something of an embarrassment ... I do not believe it was the sort of public position an agent would take whose covert goal was to smother interest in UFOs.\"\n\n1980 saw the last publication of NICAP's newsletter; the organization dissolved later that year. NICAP's archive of UFO sighting case files was subsequently purchased by the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS).\n\n\n\n\n"}

For years, he competed as Mr. X, a masked wrestler while also working as a referee.\n\nAs a referee, Davis played the role of a crooked referee that showed blatant favoritism toward certain wrestlers, with the storyline that this eventually led to his removal as a referee. He then helped manage The Hart Foundation and began wrestling as \"Dangerous\" Danny Davis. He competed at several major WWF events, during which his team won a six-man match at WrestleMania III and advanced to the semi-final round at King of the Ring 1987. He was later reinstated as a referee and remained with the company until the mid-1990s.\n\nDanny Davis started out in 1981 in the World Wrestling Federation as a referee under his birthname ring name Danny Davis. He also wrestled from 1984 to 1986 as the masked Mr. X, working masked so that the fans did not realize it was a referee in the ring. The Mr. X character was a jobber who won very few matches. He wrestled some of the WWF's top stars, including former WWF Champions Pedro Morales and Bruno Sammartino. He also participated in the 1986 King of the Ring tournament. He was given a bye to the second round but lost his match to Billy Jack Haynes. His biggest win as Mr. X came on the October 28, 1986 episode of \"WWF Prime Time Wrestling\" when he defeated fellow jobber Rudy Diamond.\n\nStarting in 1986, Davis was involved in a storyline that saw him act biased in some matches and had him involved in several controversial matches in which he was thought to favor the heel (villain) wrestlers. To push the idea that he was a crooked referee Davis would often make fast pinfall counts in the side of heel wrestlers and disqualified face (fan favorite) wrestlers with little or no provocation. WWF commentator Gorilla Monsoon accused Davis of accepting bribes, pointing to Davis' wealth as evidence as a means to make the fans dislike Davis. Davis involved himself in a steel cage match between face Hulk Hogan and heel Paul Orndorff. When both wrestlers escaped the cage at the same time, Davis declared Orndorff the winner, while referee Joey Marella stated that Hogan won. As a result, the match had to be restarted, and Hogan eventually won. By acting as a biased referee many of the fan favorite wrestlers would attack him after the matches, using the attack as a way to give them a measure of revenge on the crooked referee after \"unfairly\" losing the matches. Davis would also overreact to wrestlers putting their hands on him, disqualifying them as part of the storyline. Davis also feuded with the Killer Bees (a team composed of Jim Brunzell and B. Brian Blair) for a while, due to Davis disqualifying Brunzell and Blair in the matches that he refereed.\n\nOn the January 26, 1987 edition of \"Superstars\" (aired February 7, 1987), the Hart Foundation defeated the British Bulldogs to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Danny Davis was the referee for the match and as part of the storyline, he allowed the Hart Foundation to use illegal double-team maneuvers in the match. As a result of the match, WWF president Jack Tunney stripped Davis of his referee duties. That same night, Davis was approached by manager Jimmy Hart about joining his stable of wrestlers. Davis joined up with Jimmy Hart and the Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) and became known as \"Dangerous\" Danny Davis. He accompanied the Hart Foundation to the ring for their matches and often became involved by attacking the Hart Foundation's opponents from outside the ring or entering the ring to reverse pinfalls by placing Hart or Neidhart on top of their opponents. At the beginning of his suspension as a referee, Davis was involved in a scripted storyline in which he occasionally came to the ring and insisted that he would referee a match. This led to officials from the state athletic commission removing Davis from ringside.\n\nDavis appeared on Piper's Pit, an interview segment hosted by Roddy Piper to discuss his decisions as a referee. Davis refused to admit to any wrongdoing and was confronted by Marella, who criticized him. The segment ended with Piper attacking Davis. At WrestleMania III, Davis made his in-ring debut when he teamed up with the Hart Foundation to defeat the British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) and Tito Santana (Santana's inclusion was explained that Davis had been the referee when Tito had lost the Intercontinental Championship to \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage who had used a foreign object to get the win even though the heel gimmick had not actually started at that time). Davis got the pin on Smith after he hit him in the head with Jimmy Hart's megaphone.\n\nHis next major appearance was in the 1987 King of the Ring tournament. Davis defeated Tito Santana and Junkyard Dog before being eliminated in the third round by Randy Savage, who went on to win the tournament. During 1987, Davis was booked in several series of matches: against Koko B. Ware, George Steele, and Jake Roberts. The feud with Ware included a match televised on the April 13, 1987 episode of \"Prime Time Wrestling\", which ended in a draw. Ware won most of the matches, but Davis won several matches after using foreign objects to attack Ware.\n\nDavis initiated a feud with Steele when Steele was facing Randy Savage in a lumberjack match, which is a match where the ring is surrounded by other wrestlers. Davis, one of the \"lumberjacks\" at ringside to ensure that neither competitor could escape, attacked Steele with the timekeeper's bell and helped Savage with the match at \"Saturday Night's Main Event XI\". This feud culminated in a match on the November 28, 1987 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XIII\", in which Steele defeated Davis by disqualification after Davis kicked referee Joey Marella. Davis' feud with Roberts began when Davis showed up unexpectedly on the Snake Pit, Roberts' interview segment, while Roberts was interviewing Mr. T. Davis ran away after Roberts brought out Damien, his pet python. On the September 19, 1987 episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\", Davis attempted to steal Damien during one of Roberts' matches, but Roberts chased him away again.\n\nDavis also had a rivalry with Mr. T, who was booked to enforce the rules during matches and thwarted Davis' attempts to interfere. At the inaugural Survivor Series, Davis participated in the opening contest, joining The Honky Tonk Man, Hercules, Ron Bass and Harley Race, facing Randy Savage, Jake Roberts, Ricky Steamboat, Brutus Beefcake and Jim Duggan. Davis was the third man eliminated on his team, after Roberts performed a DDT on him. Roberts and Davis had a singles match the following month on \"Prime Time Wrestling\". Roberts beat Davis quickly, placed Damien on Davis, and left the ring.\n\nAs Davis' feuds were winding down, he entered into a new feud with Sam Houston. Houston defeated Davis in their first encounter, but Davis was upset because his foot was on the ropes and the referee should not have counted the pinfall. This disagreement led to a series of angry promotional interviews and fights, as well as a series of matches that lasted several months and saw the two trade victories. The following year, he competed in the battle royal main event at Royal Rumble 1988. He was in the ring for the fourth-longest time but was eliminated by eventual winner Jim Duggan when Davis was thrown over the top ring rope to the floor. He also competed in the 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania IV. He was thrown over the top rope by Paul Roma to be eliminated from the match.\n\nThe \"Dangerous\" Danny Davis persona was eventually phased out, and on April 22, 1989, Davis was reinstated as a \"probationary\" referee. From this point on, his officiating style became objective, and the crooked referee gimmick was dropped completely. Following his return to refereeing, his highest profile appearance was after a match at WrestleMania IX where Hulk Hogan used a foreign object to attack his opponents in a tag team contest. Davis came to the ring from backstage and disqualified Hogan overturning the victory for Hulk Hogan. He worked for the WWF until 1995.\n\nAlthough Davis was not the first person to portray the crooked wrestling referee character, he is often mentioned as a prototype of a corrupt official, which is a storyline that has been used by several wrestling promotions. One year after Davis was banned from referee duties, the twin Hebner brothers (Dave and Earl) were involved in a controversy when Earl took Dave's place and showed favoritism to André the Giant, helping him to win the WWF Championship. WCW would later use Nick Patrick as a heel referee, who sided with the NWO faction and eventually joined the NWO himself. TNA would use the gimmick with Earl Hebner, who would show favoritism towards Madison Rayne, with whom he was having an implied relationship. In a similar manner, Eric Bischoff and Vince McMahon, the heads of World Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Entertainment, respectively, have used the gimmick of evil owners in storylines.\n\nDavis's time as a wrestler and referee led to him appearing in the 1989 line of Classic WWF trading cards. Davis has continued to wrestle occasionally and currently wrestles on the Massachusetts independent wrestling scene. He competed for the World Wrestling Alliance, where he was the WWA Champion. He also occasionally performs as a referee for wrestling matches in Massachusetts. At WWE's WrestleMania XXX event, Davis made his first appearance in the company since 1995, appearing in a backstage segment with WWE legends Sgt. Slaughter, \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat, \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase, and Ron Simmons. Davis was wearing a referee shirt in the cameo.\n\n"}

Specifically, it is a quantum field theory in which, unlike most other quantum field theories, the pair of observables is not required to always commute.\n\nIn many ordinary quantum field theories, constraining one observable to a fixed value results in the uncertainty of the other observable being infinite (c.f. uncertainty principle), and as a consequence there is potentially an infinite amount of information involved. In the situation of the standard position-momentum commutation (where the uncertainty principle is most commonly cited), this implies that a fixed, finite, volume of space has an infinite capacity to store information. However, Bekenstein's bound hints that the information storage capacity ought to be finite. Qubit field theory seeks to resolve this issue by removing the commutation restriction, allowing the capacity to store information to be finite; hence the name qubit, which derives from quantum-bit or quantised-bit.\n\nDavid Deutsch has presented a group of qubit field theories which, despite not requiring commutation of certain observables, still presents the same observable results as ordinary quantum field theory.\n\nJ.

A pedestrian bridge was built in 1936.\n\nThe station closed on 1 September 1979 along with the rest of the Fremantle line, re-opening on 29 July 1983 when services were restored.\n\nIn May 2007 a single ended turnback siding was opened between the mainline tracks at the Fremantle end of the station, permitting the reversal of six-car trains moving special event crowds to and from Subiaco Oval.\n\nDaglish station is served by Transperth Fremantle line services from Fremantle to Perth that continue through to Midland via the Midland line.\n\n"}

It is one of the oldest and largest organizations of its kind, claiming more than 4,000 members worldwide with chapters and representatives in more than 43 countries and all 50 states. The organization has been criticized for its focus on pseudoscience, and critics say its investigators fail to use the scientific method.\n\nMUFON, Inc. was originally established as the Midwest UFO Network on 31 May 1969, in Quincy, Illinois, by Allen R. Utke, Walter H. Andrus, Jr., John F. Schuessler, and others. Most of MUFON's early members were associated with the \"SKYLOOK\" newsletter of Stover, Missouri and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO), formerly of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. MUFON was renamed the Mutual UFO Network in 1973 because of its expansion to other states and internationally.\n\nMUFON is currently headquartered in Irvine, California, under the direction of Jan Harzan, with chapters in every U.S. state. The organization claims to have more than 4,000 members worldwide, with a majority of its membership base situated in the continental United States. It holds an annual international symposium and publishes the monthly \"MUFON UFO Journal\". In 2015, MUFON founded Mutual UFO Network University, an unaccredited online institution which seeks to train members to investigate UFO sightings. \n\nThe group now has more than 500 field investigators, as well as specialized teams to investigate possible physical evidence of any extraterrestrial craft. The network trains volunteers to be investigators and teaches them how to interview witnesses, perform research, and how to draw conclusions from the evidence. Although investigators are not paid, they must pass both an exam based on a 265-page manual, and a background check. MUFON features a case management system on its website and hosts a web-based newsroom.\n\nAccording to science writer Sharon A. Hill, MUFON's focus is \"decidedly unscientific with talks on alien abduction, conspiracy theories, human-ET hybrids, hypnotic regression, and repressed memories\", and reflects \"a wide range of pseudoscience\". MUFON has been the subject of criticism for drifting away from their original \"nuts and bolts UFO investigation\" into \"bizarre conspiracy and exopolitics talk\". The organization receives large numbers of UFO reports every year; the qualifications of the amateur volunteers examining the reports, however, have been questioned. Hill wrote that MUFON's idea of scientific researchers \"appears to be people who are not scientists or propose fantastic, anti-science tales\".\n\nAn April 2018 article in \"Newsweek\" reported evidence of \"anti-immigrant, anti-trans, and anti-Muslim sentiments\" among MUFON officials, including MUFON donor J. Z. Knight and former MUFON State Director for Pennsylvania John Ventre, both of whom have publicly expressed racist and/or anti-Semitic views, and are described in the article as \"high-tier Inner Circle donors to MUFON\". The expressed far-right viewpoints \"kicked off a wave of anger and resignations across MUFON\", including former MUFON Director of Research Chris Cogswell (who stated, \"My internal conscience would not let me continue\") and former board member and Washington State Director James Clarkson (who stated, \"Remaining in MUFON in any capacity is morally unacceptable.\") Erica Lukes, former MUFON State Director for Utah, is also reported in the article as describing MUFON as \"an organization unwilling to adequately address sexual harassment\".\n\nMUFON has been mentioned in:\n\n\n"}

It also administrates the lower courts in the nation. It is located in the capital Santiago.\n\nIn the Chilean system, the court lacks the broader power of judicial review — it cannot set binding precedent or invalidate laws. Instead, it acts on a case-by-case basis. Trials are carried out in \"salas\", chambers of at least five judges, presided over by the most senior member.\n\nThe members of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President from a list of five choices prepared by the sitting members of the court. Two of the choices must be senior judges from appellate courts; the other three may have no judicial experience. The president's choice must then be ratified by a two-thirds majority of the Senate.\n\nSupreme Court justices must be at least 36 years old. Once appointed, a Chilean Supreme Court justice is entitled to remain on the Court until the compulsory retirement age of 75. The only exception is if a justice can be removed by \"notorious abandonment of duty,\" as deemed by a majority of both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe Supreme Court has twenty-one members, called ministers (\"ministros\").

The name is still used in New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and within the UK in Northern Ireland.\n\nRecent legal developments in Great Britain include the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, which has renamed these societies as co-operative or community benefit societies. From 1 August 2014 a new society has had to register as either a co-operative or a community benefit society rather than, as was the case previously, a society that meets either requirement. Societies already registered before that date remain registered under the 2014 Act and under ss 1 & 2 of the 2014 Act all three types of society – co-operative societies, community benefit societies, and societies already registered before 1 August 2014 – are referred to together as \"registered societies\". However, for administrative purposes the three types of society are categorised separately. \n\nThe Act applies to Great Britain but not Northern Ireland.\n\nSee Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 for information about the current law on these societies.\n\nIn 1965, an act of Parliament came into effect called the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965.\n\nIn 2006, the Friendly and Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1968 (Audit Exemption) (Amendment) Order 2006 increased the audit exemption threshold level for industrial and provident societies to £5.6 million. Also the Charities Act 2006 removed certain exemptions of charitable IPSs in England and Wales. From that point, charitable IPSs had to register with both the FCA and the Charity Commission, except registered social landlords, who register with the Tenant Services Authority.\n\nSince 2010 the IPS laws explicitly name co-operatives in their titles. The 'Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965' was renamed 'Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 1965'.\n\nIn 2011, the Legislative Reform (Industrial and Provident Societies and Credit Unions) Order 2011 increased the maximum shareholding limit, changed the date of submission of the annual return, permitted children to be members, and allows the publication of unaudited interim accounts.\n\nIn January 2012, the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron announced a project to consolidate all the legislation applicable to industrial and provident societies to be passed by 2015. There was some uncertainty as to how far new developments would address the problems with the legislation. Cameron stated, \"We know that breaking monopolies, encouraging choice, opening up new forms of enterprise is not just right for business but the best way of improving public services too.\" Ed Mayo, Secretary General of Co-operatives UK, welcomed the project. In mid-2012, revision of laws for co-operative was in its early stages. Some felt the reforms did not deal with certain key problems.\n\nChanges to the registration system under the Financial Services Act 2012 which splits the Financial Services Authority into the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) took effect on 1 April 2013. The registration function for societies was transferred to the FCA while the prudential regulation of credit unions was transferred to the PRA. In September 2013, the English and Scottish Law Commissions published a draft consolidation bill and related documents for consultation. Earlier that year, the UK Treasury, which is the department responsible for legislation for societies, published a series of proposals to increase the holding limit for withdrawable share capital in societies to at least £31,000, to apply insolvency rescue procedures to societies, and to change the rules applicable to their registers of members. Draft regulations linked to that consultation were also available, having been circulated to a small number of people. Those drafts and other materials, including a private member's bill to liberalise the use of share capital by societies presented to the UK House of Lords were explained and brought together online.\n\nIn 2014, the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 was given royal assent.\n\nIPSs were registered (but not regulated) by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which took over the job from the Registrar of Friendly Societies when it was part of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) (both being supervised by the Treasury). Note that IPS registration is quite separate from the FCA's function of regulating financial institutions.\n\nSuch businesses have been controlled in the past by the Industrial and Provident Societies Partnership Act 1852, the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893, and the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965. The legislation in the Republic of Ireland is based on modifications of the UK Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893.\n\n\nUnlike a company limited by guarantee, an IPS generally has a share capital. However, in a not-for-profit IPS the share capital may be limited to a nominal amount. Both types of IPS have a share capital, but it is usually not made up of equity shares like those in a company limited by shares, which appreciate or fall in value with the success of the enterprise that issues them. Rather they are par-value shares, which can only be redeemed (if at all) at face value. The profits and losses of an IPS are thus the common property of the members. The share typically acts as a \"membership ticket\", and voting is on a \"one member one vote\" basis. The maximum individual withdrawable shareholding is currently set at £100,000 (although other IPSs may hold more shares than this). The Legislative Reform Order (Industrial & Provident Societies and Credit Unions) Order 2011 removed the limit for non-withdrawable shares. Since 2006, the FSA has been willing, in principle, to permit societies to have non-user investor members providing certain conditions are met and this, in combination with the removal of the £100,000 holding limit for non-withdrawable shares, may open up wider possibilities for co-operatives to raise finance from investors while maintaining user control.\n\nIt may be withdrawable share capital, an unusual form of finance which is treated as equity but may be withdrawn subject to specified conditions, and is relatively cheap for small co-operatives to raise as it is exempt from certain regulations applicable to conventional share issues regarding the publication of a prospectus. However, an IPS with withdrawable share capital is not allowed to carry on a banking business, presumably because a withdrawable share capital would make it impractical to ensure capital adequacy requirements are continuously met.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After her husband's death, she gave away her magnificent collection of jewels, including her wedding ring, and sold her other possessions. With the proceeds, she opened the Convent of SS Martha and Mary and became its abbess. Her vision was to begin a religious community, made up of women from all social strata, that would merge the ideals of saints Martha and Mary, dedicated both to prayer and to serving the needs of the poor. She purchased a tract of land in Moscow and constructed a hospital, an orphanage for girls, and quarters for the nuns. Working in conjunction with church authorities she developed the monastic rule and habit—which differed somewhat from the traditional habit of Orthodox nuns—that would be used at the convent. At its peak, the convent housed 97 sisters and served 300 meals daily to the poor. \n\nFrom 1908–12, Alexey Shchusev designed the Church of Saints Martha and Mary and the Holy Protection Cathedral, both structures being Russian Revival and Art Nouveau renderings of a medieval Novgorod architectural type. The cathedral's snow-white walls are adorned with carved crosses by Sergey Konenkov. The interior contains frescoes and mosaics by Mikhail Nesterov and Pavel Korin.\n\nThe sisters woke at 6:00 a.m. and organized their rooms. At 7:30 they gathered in the hospital chapel for a common rule of prayer followed by the reading of a gospel, an epistle, a psalm, and perhaps a brief sermon by the priest serving that day. The sisters departed from the chapel after receiving a blessing from the priest and greeting the mother superior. They then gathered for some tea before going to their daily obediences. Those who were not immediately needed at their obedience remained in the chapel for the Divine Liturgy.\nSisters were responsible for the reading and chanting in both churches. The chant was generally of a simple monastic style, with concert singing very seldom used. The choir members also did handiwork in the community workshop, where all the clothing of the sisters was made.\nFollowing morning prayers, the sisters would be found at their various obediences: some in the hospital awaiting the doctors making rounds, others in the clinic to provide treatment such as massages, injections, etc., for the ailing, others in the school, and yet others in the kitchen or other areas of the house.\nTwice a week between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. the spiritual father offered the sisters a lecture, one week on the catechism, and the following week one on the holy fathers. The sisters prepared for Holy Communion at least four times a year during the major fasts, though they were allowed to receive more often if they wished.\nAt 12:30 lunch was served with the reading of the life of the saint of the day during the meal. Meals were prepared in accordance with church fasting rules. Tea was served at 4:00 p.m. followed by vespers and matins at 5:00 p.m. Sisters who have completed their obediences were present at these services. Before feast days and Sundays, all-night vigils were held. At 7:30 p.m. dinner was served. There was common evening prayer at 9:00 p.m. in the hospital chapel. The sisters retired to their cells following prayer, receiving a blessing from the superior as they departed. By 10:30 p.m. all prepare for sleep, and by 11:00 p.m. there was quiet and all lights were extinguished.\n\nFor their spiritual strengthening and edification the sisters visited with the Abbess or spiritual father at appointed times.\nFour times a week an akathist hymn was read during the evening prayer rule: on Sundays, to the Savior; Mondays, to Archangel Michael and all the Heavenly Hosts; Wednesdays, to Sts. Martha and Mary; and Fridays, to the Mother of God or the Passion of Christ.\nThe sisters were also obliged to attend Vigil and Liturgy at the Chudov Monastery on the feast days of the holy hierarch St. Alexis of Moscow, February 12 and May 20. A pilgrimage was also made to the sepulchre church of the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich on February 4, the day of his repose.\n\nThe sisters wore white cotton robes on Sundays and feast days. The work uniform was a grey cotton robe cut like a cassock, sewn together in front and closed on the sides. with white cuffs on the sleeves. The head covering of tonsured members was a white apostolnik cut in the monastic style with a grey woolen veil. Those tonsured also wore a cross made of cypress wood around their necks on a white string. The icons of Christ-Not-Made-By-Hands and the Protection of the Mother of God are on one side of the cross; the other side holds an icon of Sts. Martha and Mary and the inscription: \"Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all your soul, and all thy mind, and all thy strength; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" Sisters received this cross at their tonsure into the sisterhood, giving a vow to devote this specific period of their lives to God and neighbor, and to abide by the rules of the community.\n\nAll sisters were given a prayer rope upon entering the community with the obligation to recite the Jesus Prayer 100 times daily. Postulants did not wear the prayer rope externally, but those tonsured wore the prayer rope they received a second time at their tonsure on their left hand. Postulants wore a long white kerchief on their heads, which covered their foreheads completely. On Sundays and feast days the sisters wore white robes. The postulants wore gray robes.\n\nA primary obligation of the sisters was to visit the poor. A few sisters were sent out daily in pairs to visit assigned areas of the city. The Grand Duchess received over twelve thousand petitions annually. A portion of these were reviewed by the sisters, processed along with the numerous other requests and information about the poor received from other sources.\n\nIn 1920, the convent was forced by the Soviet authorities to provide a comprehensive listing of the Order’s properties, both moveable and immoveable. This document has all information concerning not only the Cathedral of the Holy Protection, but the lower church of the Archangel Michael and All the Bodiless Powers, the hospital Church of Sts. Martha and Mary, the funerary chapel, and the psaltery. This extraordinary catalogue and several which were later published provide a complete enumeration of the liturgical objects, icons, artworks, valuables, and their placement.\n\nDespite the anti-religious sentiment, it was well understood that the convent and its churches represented a rare gesamtkunstwerk (complete work of art), and that its synergy of architecture, decoration, and collections of fine and decorative art were exceedingly important.\n\nBy 1922, however, the government began to order a systematic nationalization and confiscation of the convent's property, beginning to remove valuable gold and silver objects such as ikon oklads, rizas, gospel covers, crosses and ecclesiastical and liturgical objects.\n\nIn 1923, the convent tried to remake itself as the “Martha and Mary Community of Industry” in order to continue their works despite the civil war and official atheist position of the government. By 1925, the convent was being attacked for its makeup of former aristocrats and bourgeoises, and soon, the organization was under strain.\n\nIn 1926, the Church of SS Martha & Mary was closed, though the remaining nuns were able to remove over 200 icons and the “royal doors” from the cathedral by moving them to the Church of the Holy Protection. Shortly after this, the order was officially disbanded, and eighteen of the remaining nuns were exiled to Turkestan in Central Asia.\n\nIn 1928, both churches were finally closed, looted, pillaged, and desecrated. The frescos by Nesterov were covered and the church was turned into a movie theater. From 1945, the church was used by the Grabar Institute as an icon and painting restoration studio.\n\nVeneration of the Grand Duchess as a Saint and New Martyr had begun outside of Russia soon after her interment at Jerusalem, and her memory was honored secretly within the Soviet Union. With the collapse of communism, official attitudes changed. Elizabeth had already been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1981, but in 1990 a monument was erected on the convent grounds, and in 1992, the Grand Duchess was glorified (canonized) by the Russian Orthodox Church (see Romanov sainthood). Later that year, the celebration of divine services was resumed in the Church of Martha and Mary, and in 1994 the sisterhood was re-established.\n\nIn 1999 the Educational Center of the SS Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy was founded, with the blessings of Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and All Russia, for the purpose of training Orthodox girls as certified nurses.\n\nAs a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Grand Duchess Elizabeth is closely related to the Greek, Danish, and British Royal families.\n\nElizabeth's older sister was Victoria, Marchioness of Milford-Haven, whose daughter Alice married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark. Princess Alice became the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and later founded a nursing order of Greek Orthodox nuns, the \"Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary\". This was modelled on the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent that her aunt had founded in Russia, but the order eventually failed for want of suitable applicants. Princess Alice was buried near Grand Duchess Elizabeth in the Russian Orthodox Church of Mary Magdalen on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2002, HRH Prince Charles commissioned the British composer and convert to the Russian Orthodox Church, John Tavener, to write a choral piece in memory of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. The work was entitled \"Elizabeth Full of Grace\" and celebrates the life, death and glorification of Saint Elizabeth the Grand Duchess. It was premiered at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 28 February 2003 by Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky Chorus and Orchestra. Proceeds from the performance went to benefit the charitable work of the Saints Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy.\n\n\n"}

However, it has not yet won a championship. Blue Thunder was used by Ford Motor Company for promotional purposes along with competition. The truck is currently driven by Matt Cody. The truck did not compete in 2012 when Todd LeDuc moved to Metal Mulisha after driving Blue Thunder in 2011. With Ford dropping its sponsorship in 2012, the truck was redesigned and brought back in 2013 with veteran driver Dan Evans; former owner/driver of the Destroyer monster truck.\n\nFord Motor Company teamed up with Live Nation to create a monster truck that would highlight its \"Ford Tough\" campaign. The body style would be based on the F series Ford pickup with the body style being changed with each model year. Patrick Chassis was chosen to construct the chassis for Blue Thunder. The drive line consists of a Merlin 540ci blown & injected engine with a Dedenbear two speed automatic transmission. This setup has caused some controversy, as Merlin engines are based on the Big Block Chevrolet. The tires on Blue Thunder are 66\" Goodyear Terra Tires. Construction of two trucks with the \"Blue Thunder\" name were completed. The debut of Blue Thunder was January 6, 2001, at the Houston Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Since its debut, it has placed in the finals every year. It performs at more than 20 events per year and is displayed at various promotional events. It also has been licensed for various toys and for two upcoming video games \n\nWhen the Blue Thunder debuted in 2001, Lyle Hancock was the primary driver. Through the years, Norm Miller, Bobby Zoellner, George Balhan and Tony Farrell have also been drivers.

Allen Hynek, who at the time was Chair of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University in Illinois.\n\nHynek was a scientific consultant for Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force official study of the UFO phenomenon from 1948 to 1969. Although Hynek started out as a skeptic and helped the Air Force to debunk most UFO reports, he gradually became convinced that a small number of UFO cases were not hoaxes or explainable as misidentifications of natural phenomena, and that these cases might represent something extraordinary — even alien visitation from other planets. When the Air Force shut down Project Blue Book in 1969, Hynek, in 1973, founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) to continue to collect and study UFO reports. Ufologist James W. Moseley wrote that CUFOS was \"... the first real attempt to set up a private research group genuinely dedicated to scientific investigations and study of UFOs.\" Moseley observed that CUFOS \"wasn't a saucer club and, for a while, wasn't open to general membership. Participation was restricted to scientists and other professionals who donated their time and expertise, Hynek's invisible college. This wouldn't last — though CUFOS has.\"\n\nStarted in Evanston, Illinois, but now based in Chicago, CUFOS continues to be a small research organization stressing scientific analysis of UFO cases. Its extensive archives include historically valuable files from defunct civilian research groups such as National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the largest UFO research group of the 1950s and 1960s. Following Hynek's death in 1986, CUFOS was renamed the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in his honor. The Director of CUFOS since 1986 has been Mark Rodeghier. Ufologists who have served on the CUFOS Board of Directors are Jerome Clark, UFO historian and author of \"The UFO Encyclopedia\"; Michael D. Swords, a retired professor of natural science at Western Michigan University; and Thomas E. Bullard, a folklorist at Indiana University.\n\nThe Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) has two principal activities. First, it maintains a library and archives of UFO-related materials, which are open for use by researchers and investigators who are writing about UFO-related topics. These materials include books, articles, documents, and sighting reports. Second, CUFOS continues to compile and analyze reports of UFO incidents from around the world.\n\n\n"}

He played as a left back or left-sided midfielder.\n\nBorn in Conakry, Guinea, Camara spent the early years of his professional career in French football, with Beauvais in 1993, and in 1996 went on loan to Troyes, where he played 13 league games. He made a total of 79 league appearances for Beauvais, before signing for Le Havre in August 1997, where he was sent on loan to Lille.\n\nCamara moved to England in summer 2000 with Wolverhampton Wanderers of the First Division in a £100,000 deal. He became a cult figure amongst their fans, known for his commitment and pace despite sometimes exhibiting a lack of positional sense and ball control. A regular column from the spoof 'Mohammed Camara Appreciation Society' appeared in fanzine 'A Load of Bull' celebrating his eccentric but lovable playing style. He was a regular starter in his first two seasons with the side, but failed to make an appearance during their 2002–03 promotion success following the signing of Denis Irwin and a knee ligament injury.\n\nCamara joined Burnley on a free transfer in June 2003, which gave Camara regular playing time once again. After Steve Cotterill replaced previous manager Stan Ternent, he made the left-back focus on his crossing ability, causing a dramatic up-turn in his form at the beginning of the 2004–05 season. He scored once for Burnley in the League Cup as they memorably knocked out Premier League side Aston Villa in October 2004.\n\nCamara's form attracted interest from Scottish Premier League side Celtic, who he joined at the end of his two-year contract under the Bosman ruling at the end of the season.\n\nAfter one-to-one sessions with manager Gordon Strachan, Camara started to do well and established himself as a defender in Celtic's first eleven. However, after Ross Wallace was converted into a left-back, Camara was relegated to the bench and made only rare appearances. He fell further down the pecking order after the signing of right-back Mark Wilson, who was also converted to left back.\n\nDespite earlier pledging to fight for his place at Celtic, Camara ending up leaving to join Derby County on a free transfer in August 2006. He was a regular player during the first half of the season, however he found himself out of contention after Derby signed Jay McEveley in the January transfer window. The following season, with the club newly in the Premier League, saw Camara find appearances just as scarce. Despite scoring against Blackpool in the League Cup at the start of the season, he made just one appearance in the top flight, a 0–6 thrashing at Liverpool, before later being loaned to Championship side Norwich City. This was subsequently extended to cover the whole of the 2007/08 campaign.\n\nOn 5 August 2008, Camara moved to Derby's Championship rivals Blackpool on loan until 30 August. He made his debut for the Seasiders on 9 August in a 1–0 home defeat to Bristol City. On 9 September the loan was extended for a further month, with manager Simon Grayson saying, \"He has done very well for us in the first four league games. He has good energy and experience and he has been a good addition.\" The loan period was extended for a third and final time on 17 October, keeping him with \"the Seasiders\" until 22 November.\n. Upon his return to Derby Camara featured in a FA Cup victory at Forest Green Rovers but was deemed surplus to requirements by new Derby manager Nigel Clough and his contract was cancelled on 2 February 2009.\n\nAfter the January 2009 transfer window shut, free agent Camara moved back to Scotland to sign for Scottish Premier League side St Mirren.\n\nSoon after being released from St Mirren, Camara joined English League Two side Torquay United. Having made his debut in a 2–1 home defeat to Port Vale on 13 February, Camara made his second and final appearance for the Gulls six days later in a match at Rotherham United in which he was substituted at half time. It was finally confirmed by manager Paul Buckle on 24 April that Camara was no longer at the club.\n\nHe was released by Torquay on 15 May 2010, along with six other players.\n\nCamara was made head of European scouting at Derby County in February 2014 and opened a wine bar in Tettenhall, an affluent area of Wolverhampton in 2017.\n\n"}

{"id": "2181128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181128", "title": "Mark VIII tank", "text": "Mark VIII tank\n\nThe Mark VIII tank also known as the Liberty or The International was a British-American tank design of the First World War intended to overcome the limitations of the earlier British designs and be a collaborative effort to equip France, the UK and the US with a single heavy tank design.\n\nProduction at a site in France was expected to take advantage of US industrial capacity to produce the automotive elements, with the UK producing the armoured hulls and armament. The planned production levels would have equipped the Allied armies with a very large tank force that would have broken through the German defensive positions in the planned offensive for 1919. In practice manufacture was slow and only a few vehicles were produced before the end of the war in November 1918.\n\nAfter the war, 100 vehicles assembled in the US were used by the US Army until more advanced designs replaced them in 1932. A few tanks that had not been scrapped by the start of World War II were provided to Canada for training purposes.\n\nAs the First World War progressed, the industrial production capacity of the Entente was taxed to the limit. Of the Allies, only Great Britain and France had been major industrial nations in 1914 and the latter had lost 70% of its heavy industry when the Germans overran that part of Lorraine that they had not already occupied in 1871. The output in Britain was limited by labour shortages due to the manpower demand of the armed forces and a rocketing national debt.\n\nWhen the United States of America declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, many in Britain hoped this event would solve all these problems. The two men directly responsible for British tank production, Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt and Lieutenant-Colonel Albert Gerald Stern, initially considered sending a delegation to the United States immediately, to convince the new ally to start production of a British tank design. After some reflection they decided it was best to leave the initiative to the Americans. Stern did contact the American Military Attaché in London immediately after war was declared. In June 1917 the first American approaches were made, but not by the US Army as they had expected. The US Navy wanted the most modern tanks for its US Marine Corps. At that moment the current British tank project was the Mark VI. It was designed with existing British industrial capacity in mind, posing limits that might be overcome by larger American production facilities. Stern therefore pretended that an even more advanced project had already been in existence which he called the Mark VIII (there was also a much more conventional Mark VII project). He invited the Americans to participate and contribute as much as they would like to its design. The Navy was on the brink of sending a team of engineers to Britain when the American Department of War was informed of developments by the US Military Attaché in London. It ordered the project to be shifted to the Army and selected Major H. W. Alden – in peacetime he had been an industrial expert – to go to the UK to work with the Mechanical Warfare Department design team at Dollis Hill on the first drawings of the new tank. He arrived in London on the 3 October, to discover that a lot of design work had already been done by Lieutenant G J Rackham, who had been sent to the Front to see for himself how the current designs performed in the dismal conditions then encountered at the battlefield in Flanders.\n\nThe US Army had set up headquarters in France. In September it decided to form its own tank corps with 25 tank battalions including five heavy tank battalions. To equip the heavy units, Major James A. Drain – a staff officer to General Pershing and responsible for initial planning of the tank force – provisionally ordered 600 Mark VI tanks (then under development) from the British in October 1917. The Army tried to convince the Department of War to divert all available tanks to the Army, leading to a conflict with the Navy (the first of many to come over this issue). This posed serious problems for the British government. It now seemed that American involvement in the war would mean a lesser number of tanks available for the British forces. Also on 4 February 1917 binding agreements had been made with the French about tank production. These had to be renegotiated.\n\nWinston Churchill, the new Minister of Munitions, had just been forced to fire Stern as director of the Mechanical Supply Department (Controller of the Mechanical Warfare Department) because of his mistakes in handling the Mark IV project, leading to enormous production delays. In pushing production through in the early days he had upset civil and military authorities. Stern was appointed in September to the new position of \"Commissioner for Mechanical Warfare (Overseas and Allies Branch)\" in order to coordinate tank production with the US and France. Stern went to France to meet the French Minister of Munitions, Louis Loucheur and the American commander-in-chief, John Pershing. Loucheur made it clear from the beginning that France had nothing to offer in terms of existing production facilities. This came as no surprise to Stern who had already prepared an \"International Plan\" of ten points (in fact a bilateral agreement between the USA and Britain) that he now managed to get accepted by the Americans. He submitted this to Churchill on the 11 November. Its main points included (using the original terminology):\n\n\nThe plan already contained a specification: the tank should have a 300 hp (220 kW) engine, weigh 38.8 tons (39.5 tonnes) and have a trench crossing capacity of 14 feet (4.3 m). The 11 November briefing included the first use of the word \"Liberty\" for the tank which was taken from the engine chosen.\n\nThe first design conference took place on 4 December at GHQ in France and Churchill approved the plan soon afterwards. It was made into a formal treaty signed by the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour and the US Ambassador Walter Hines Page on 19 January 1918. The treaty specified the programme in great detail. The first 1,500 tanks had to be made by the end of the year and the factory should be capable of expansion to 1,200 a month. Both goals were very ambitious given the fact there was neither a completed design nor a factory and that British tank production would in fact be 150 a month during 1918.\n\nThe United States would supply: the engine; radiator; fan; piping; silencer; lighting; dynamo; battery; propeller shaft; transmission, including gearbox; brakes; roller sprockets; gear shift and brake control; track links and pins; rear track sprockets, hub and shafts; front idler hub and shafts; track roller, track spindles and bushings.\n\nBritain would supply: bullet and bomb-proof plates; structural members; track shoes and rollers; guns, machine guns and mountings; ammunition racks and ammunition.\n\nThe agreed price was to be £5,000 per vehicle.\nIn December 1917 the Mark VI order was cancelled ensuring that the Mark VIII would be the new standard Allied weapon.\n\nThe Mark VIII kept many of the general features of the Mark I-V series: it had their typical high track run and no revolving turret but two sponsons, one on each side of the tank, armed with a 6-pounder (57 mm) gun. But it also resembled the Mark VI-project in that it had more rounded and wider tracks and a large superstructure on top directly beneath the front of which the driver was seated. An innovative feature was the departure from the concept of the \"box tank\" with its single space into which all accessories were crammed. The Mark VIII was compartimentalised with a separate engine room at the back. This vastly improved fighting conditions as a bulkhead protected the crew against the deafening engine noise, noxious fumes and heat.\n\nThere were no machine guns in the sponsons, only the 6-pounders each manned by a gunner and loader. The side machine guns were to the rear of the sponsons mounted in the hull doors. Major Alden had designed the sponsons to be retractable (they could be swung in at the rear by the crew, being pivoted at the front), to reduce the width of the vehicle if enemy obstacles were encountered. Five more machine guns were in the superstructure: two at the front—left and right next to the driver—and one on each of the other sides. As there was no machine gun position covering the back of the tank there was a dead angle vulnerable to infantry attack. To solve this problem a triangular steel deflector plate was attached. The rear superstructure machine gunner could use it to deflect his fire down into that area behind the tank. The tank carried 208 shells and 13,848 machine gun rounds, mostly in a large ammunition locker in the centre which formed a platform on which the commander stood behind the driver observing the battlefield through a cupola with four vision slits. Later the side superstructure guns were removed on US tanks.\n\nThe twelfth crew member was the mechanic, seated next to the 300 hp Liberty V-12 (or in British tanks Ricardo V-12) petrol engine) cooled by a large horizontal radiator. Three armoured fuel tanks at the rear held 200 Imperial gallons (240 US gallons, or 909 litres) of fuel giving a range of 89 km. The transmission used a planetary gearbox giving two speeds in either forward or reverse. Top speed was 5.25 mph (8 km/h).\n\nTo improve its trench crossing ability to 4.88 m the vehicle had a very elongated shape. The track length was 34 ft 2 in (10.42 m) but even though the hull width was an impressive nominal 3.76 m, the actual length-width ratio of the tracks was very poor as that width included the sponsons. Combined with wide tracks it proved difficult to turn the tank. During testing many tracks twisted and broke in a turn and it was decided to use longer, stronger 13.25 inch (337 mm) links made of hardened cast armour plate, stiffened by webs formed by recesses in the track plate. Another effect of the narrow hull was that the fighting compartment was also very narrow. This was made worse by the fact that now the gap between the double track frames at each side was very wide; earlier types had only the tracks themselves widened. Nevertheless the tank was supposed to accommodate another twenty infantry men in full gear if necessary. In absolute terms the vehicle was very large: at 10 ft 3 in (3.13 m) tall the Mark VIII was the second largest operational tank in history, after the Char 2C. However its weight was only fitted for battle as the armour plate was thin with a thickness of 16 mm on the front and sides—a slight improvement over the Mark V but very thin by later standards. The roof and bottom of the hull were protected by only 6 mm thick armour plate, leaving the tank very vulnerable to mortar shells and landmines.\n\nThe French government hoped to receive 700 Mark VIIIs for free, as the French superheavy tank, the Char 2C, could not be produced in sufficient numbers, if at all. However, suffering from a lack of manpower and raw materials the French were not forthcoming in providing any facilities for the production of the International Tank. Soon the Americans decided to build a brand new assembly factory at Neuvy-Pailloux 200 miles south of Paris, contracting a British company. Far from producing its first tank in April, the factory was not even finished by June. In August they contracted another British firm. It finished the factory in November, by which point the war had already ended; not a single tank would be built there.\n\nThere were also serious delays in the production of the components. The Liberty aero engine with its expensive drawn-steel cylinders was redesigned with cheaper cast iron cylinders. These redesigned engines were only produced in October. In spite of these delays, there were plans to produce a further 1,500 tanks in the United States on top of the shared production in France. This was not possible due to lack of armour and guns so the extra production was to be in France as well.\n\nThe British finished the prototype hull, made of unhardened steel, in July and sent it to the United States. On arrival it transpired that no mass-produced parts were ready to finish the prototype, so the Locomobile Automobile Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut made these all by hand, completing the first vehicle on the 28 September. Testing began on 31 October. Only then was the armament shipped from Britain, and two guns and ten Hotchkiss machine guns were fitted.\n\nTesting was finished after the war and it was decided to build 100 vehicles in the USA; these were constructed in 1919 and 1920 by the Rock Island Arsenal for $35,000 each. The US bought 100 complete sets of parts for the hull from the British, the whole amount that had been completed.\n\nMeanwhile the British government had decided to start their own production in Britain. One thousand, four hundred and fifty vehicles were ordered from the North British Locomotive Company, William Beardmore and Company and Metropolitan, to use a 300 hp (220 kW) V12 Ricardo engine instead of the Liberty. Only the first managed to produce anything by the end of the war with seven vehicles built. The mild steel prototype with a Rolls-Royce engine was tested on 11 November, the day of the Armistice.\n\nFrom parts already produced a further 24 vehicles were completed after the war. Five were sent to the training centre at Bovington in Dorset, and the others went straight to the scrap dealer.\n\nDuring 1918, the then prevalent preoccupation with trench crossing capabilities led to preparations being made for the production of an even longer tank: the Mark VIII* (\"Star\"). The hull was to be lengthened a full three meters: four feet (1.2 m) at the front and six feet (1.8 m) at the back. This way it should be able to cross a trench 18 feet (5.5 m) wide. To ensure that the tank could turn at all, despite its critically high length-width ratio, the bottom profile of the tracks would be more strongly curved, so that a smaller part of the track would touch the ground. Ground pressure would have increased however, as total weight reached 42.5 tons (43.2 tonnes). If the tank had sunk into soft ground somewhat, it's questionable whether it would have been able to make a turn. No prototype was built.\n\nThe American Liberty tanks equipped a single unit: the 67th Infantry (Tank) Regiment, based in Aberdeen, Maryland. The curious designation of the unit had its origin in the fact that since 1922 by law all tanks had to be part of the Infantry. The two machine gun positions at the sides of the superstructure were eliminated, so the crew could be reduced to ten. Water-cooled M1917 Browning machine guns were used. Despite many modifications the vehicles suffered from overheating and poor reliability, causing a prejudice in the Army against the use of heavy tanks. From 1932 onward they were phased out; all were in storage in 1934. In 1940, Canada had a lack of training tanks and were offered the remaining tanks at scrap value, but the Canadians instead opted to purchase M1917 light tanks.\n\n\nThe tank appearing in the 1989 \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" movie was a replica vehicle made from an excavator, following the hull shape of the Mark VIII but with a turret added.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2181136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181136", "title": "Owen gun", "text": "Owen gun\n\nThe Owen gun, which was known officially as the Owen machine carbine, was an Australian submachine gun designed by Evelyn Owen in 1939. The Owen was the only entirely Australian-designed and constructed service submachine gun of World War II and was used by the Australian Army from 1943 until the mid-1960s.\n\nOwen, an inventor from Wollongong, was 24 years old in July 1939 when he demonstrated his prototype .22 calibre \"Machine Carbine\" to Australian Army ordnance officers at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. The gun was rejected for two reasons. The first was because the Australian army, at the time, did not recognise the value of submachine guns. The second was the basic construction of the prototype was completely unsuited as a military weapon, especially as it lacked a proper trigger or any safety device, was of small calibre, and the \"magazine\" was effectively a giant revolver cylinder which could not be exchanged to reload. Following the outbreak of war, Owen joined the Australian Army as a private.\n\nIn September 1940, Owen's neighbour, Vincent Wardell, discovered Owen's prototype in a sugar bag. Wardell was manager of a large steel products factory at Port Kembla. He showed it to Owen's father who was distressed at his son’s carelessness, but explained the history of the weapon. Wardell was impressed by the simplicity of Owen's design. Wardell arranged to have Owen transferred to the Army Inventions Board, to re-commence work on the gun. The army continued to view the weapon in a negative light, but the government took an increasingly favourable view.\n\nThe prototype was equipped with a \"magazine\" consisting of a steel ring, drilled with holes for .22 cartridges, that was revolved through the action using the power of a gramophone spring. This arrangement later gave way to a top-mounted box magazine, which allowed shooting while prone.\n\nThe choice of calibre took some time to be settled. As large quantities of Colt .45 ACP cartridges were available; it was decided to adopt the Owen gun for it. Official trials were organised, and the John Lysaght factory made three versions in 9×19mm, .38-200 and .45 ACP. Sten and Thompson submachine guns were used as benchmarks. As part of the testing, all of the guns were immersed in mud and covered with sand to simulate the harshest environments in which they would be used. The Owen was the only gun that still operated after the treatment. Although the test showed the Owen's capability, the army could not decide on a calibre, and it was only after intervention from the higher levels of government that the army ordered the 9×19mm variant.\n\nDuring the gun's life, its reliability earned it the nickname \"Digger's Darling\" by Australian troops, and it was rumoured to be highly favoured by US troops. General Douglas MacArthur proposed placing an order for some 45,000.\n\nThe Owen went into production at the John Lysaght factories at Port Kembla and Newcastle. Between March 1942 and February 1943, Lysaght's produced 28,000 Owen guns. However, the initial batch of ammunition turned out to be the wrong type and 10,000 guns could not be supplied with ammunition. Once again the government overrode military bureaucracy, and took the ammunition through the final production stages and into the hands of Australian troops, at that time fighting Japanese forces in New Guinea. Approximately 45,000 Owens were produced from 1942 to 1944. During the war, the average cost to manufacture the Owen submachine gun was $30.\nAlthough it was somewhat bulky, the Owen became very popular with soldiers because of its reliability. New Zealanders fighting in the Guadacanal and Solomon Islands campaigns swapped their Thompson submachine guns for Owens, as they found Owen guns to be more reliable.\n\nThe Owen was later used by Australian troops in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, particularly the scouts in infantry sections. It remained a standard weapon of the Australian Army until the mid-1960s, when it was replaced by the F1 submachine gun and, later, the M16.\n\nThe Owen has a simple blowback design, firing from an open bolt. It was designed to be fired either from the shoulder or the hip. It is easily recognisable, owing to its unconventional appearance, including the top-mounted magazine, and the side-mounted sight required to allow the firer to aim past it. The placement of the magazine allows gravity to assist the magazine spring in pushing cartridges down to the breech, which improves feeding reliability. Another unusual feature is the separate compartment inside the receiver, which isolates the small-diameter bolt from its retracting handle by means of a small bulkhead. This prevents dirt and mud from jamming the bolt, and makes the Owen a highly reliable weapon. Foreign dirt entering the gun would collect at the back of the receiver, where it would drain out or be expelled through a small opening. When tested, the Owen gun was able to continue firing despite being dipped in mud and drenched with sand, while a Sten gun and a Thompson also tested stopped functioning at once. In jungle warfare, where both mud and sand were frequent problems, the Owen gun was highly regarded by the soldiers.\n\nTo facilitate cleaning, the ejector was built into the magazine, rather than the body of the gun. This allowed the barrel to be removed rapidly, by pulling up a spring-loaded plunger in front of the magazine housing. After removing the barrel, the bolt and return spring are removed in a forward direction, completely dismantling the gun. Like the Sten, the Owen had a non-folding wire buttstock, but also had pistol grips like the Austen.\n\nTwo horseshoe magazines were constructed in the field, of 60 and 72 rounds. Little information exists as to the success of these experiments.\n\nIn 2004, an underground weapons factory was seized in Melbourne, Australia, yielding, among other things, three silenced copies of the Owen submachine gun and parts to make six more. These had magazines inserted underneath rather than overhead, and were suspected of having been built for sale to local gangs involved in the illegal drug trade.\n\n\nThe gun received an Engineering Heritage National Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\n\n\n"}

Located in the state's capital, Juneau, the building was opened on February 14, 1931 as a federal building. After Alaska gained statehood, the building served as the home for the Alaska Legislature.\n\nUpon the purchase of Russian America, Sitka, Alaska became the Territory Capital in 1867. After the capital was moved to Juneau, the Legislature met in rented rooms around the city.\n\nConstruction for a capitol building was partly funded by the United States Congress, but they refused to give more. Local citizens managed to pay the rest of the cost for land, which was then given to the government. Construction on the building began on September 18, 1929, and it ended on February 2, 1931. The building, originally named the Federal and Territorial Building was dedicated on February 14, 1931. It hosted federal services until 1959, where the Alaska Statehood Act granted Alaska permission to settle in the building.\n\nThe capitol has been attempted to be relocated. These attempts began as early as 1960, where a proposal to move the government to the Cook Inlet area failed. The most recent attempt was in 2002.\n\nThe building is six stories high and made from brick-faced reinforced concrete, with a facade of Indiana limestone on the first two floors. The portico has four columns made of Tokeen marble from Prince of Wales Island, which is also used for interior trim. Because it lacks the large landscaped grounds of most state capitols, it could appear to be simply an office building. It is one of only eleven state capitols (along with those of Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia) that do not feature a dome.\n\nOutside the building is a replica of the Liberty Bell, of the type given to all states and territories by the federal government in 1950 to help raise support for savings bond drives.\n\nThe lobby features clay murals titled \"Harvest of the Land\" and \"Harvest of the Sea\", representing hunting and fishing, as well as a bust of Alaska Native activist Elizabeth Peratrovich. Offices and committee rooms fill the ground and first floors.\n\nThe second floor houses the chambers of the Alaska Senate and Alaska House of Representatives, as well as committee rooms. The walls feature the work of early Juneau photographers Lloyd Winter and Percy Pond, and busts of the first two U.S. Senators from Alaska, Bob Bartlett and Ernest Gruening.\nThe Alaska Governor and Lieutenant Governor's offices are located on the third floor. The executive office doors are made of black birch, with hand carvings depicting Alaskan industry. The \"Hall of Governors\" features portraits of governors and lieutenant governors of Alaska from the District of Alaska era to the present.\n\nMore legislative offices and committee rooms occupy the fourth floor. The fifth floor holds legislative finance committees.\n\nMany areas of the building have been restored to their original 1930s appearance, especially on the second and fifth floors—the latter originally had federal courtrooms.\nIn 2012, the State of Alaska undertook a 4-year, $33 million project to provide seismic upgrades to the building as well as further restore the building to its original appearance.\n"}

He was enlisted as a cadet in his father's regiment, where he worked on land survey. After a couple of years he left the regiment to study at the Technological Institute of Stockholm, later known as KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\n\nIn partnership with his brother-in-law, Theodor Winborg (1832-1918), Palmcrantz founded a small workshop on Vollmar Yxkullsgatan 25, Södermalm, Stockholm. As number of employees increased along with the production volume, he moved to a new factory on Kungsholmen, Stockholm, where they manufactured firearms, reaping machines, mowers and other agricultural equipment of their own design. Later on there would be Palmcrantz factory, Palmcrantzska Fabriken, on Lövholmen, Stockholm.\nIn 1868, the first version of his machine-gun was finished and a demonstration of its capacity was held on Ladugårdsgärdet, Stockholm in front of the Swedish Defense Minister; G.R. Abel. After a couple of modifications and improvements, he patented the multi-barrel, lever-actuated, machine gun and it was bought into the Swedish army. Same year, the machine-gun was shown on the 1873 Vienna World's Fair. \n\nTo reach international success, Palmcrantz met industrialist Thorsten Nordenfelt (1842-1920) in 1875 and the latter's company became his British agent. They agreed to market the machine-gun under the then well known Nordenfelt brand and his second model would later be known as the \"Nordenfelt machine-gun\" after his financial backer. It was Nordenfelt who convinced Palmcrantz to increase the caliber of his gun to one inch, making it a suitable weapon for use against the growing threat of torpedo boats.\n\nPalmcrantz succumbed to an early death from a bleeding ulcer. He was buried at Norra Begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.\n\nHelge Palmcrantz has a former school named after him; Palmcrantzskolan in Östersund.

The United States Navy ordered one prototype, model number G-34, from Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation on 30 June 1938; its designation was XF5F-1. The aircraft had a unique appearance: The forward \"nose\" of the fuselage did not extend forward of the wing. Provisions were included for two 20 mm (0.906 in) Madsen cannon as armament.\n\nIn 1938 Grumman presented a proposal to the U. S. Navy for a twin engine carrier based aircraft, unlike any other fighter aircraft that had ever been considered. The design was for a lightweight fighter (under 10,000 lbs maximum takeoff weight) powered by two 1,200 hp Wright R-1820 engines, with propellers geared to rotate in opposite directions to cancel out the effects of each engine's torque, promising high-speed, and an outstanding rate of climb.\n\nThe XF5F Skyrocket was a low-wing monoplane with a short fuselage that began aft of the wing's leading edge with a twin tail assembly that featured a pronounced dihedral to the horizontal stabilizer. The main landing gear and tail wheel were fully retractable.\nThe aircraft flew for the first time on 1 April 1940. Engine cooling problems arose in the initial flights, resulting in modification to the oil cooling ducts. Further modifications were made to the prototype including reduction in the height of the cockpit canopy, revising the armament installation to four 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in place of the cannon, redesign of the engine nacelles, adding spinners to the propellers, and extending the fuselage forward of the wing. These changes were completed on 15 July 1941.\n\nTesting by Grumman test pilot \"Connie\" Converse indicated \"the flying qualities for the XF5F-1 were good overall. The counter-rotating props were a nice feature, virtually eliminating the torque effect on takeoff ... single-engine performance was good, rudder forces tended to be high in single engine configuration. Spin recovery was positive but elevator forces required for recovery were unusually high. All acrobatics were easily performed, and of course forward visibility was excellent.\"\n\nIn 1941, Navy pilots tested the XF5F-1 in a fly-off against the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Bell XFL Airabonita, Vought XF4U Corsair, Grumman F4F Wildcat, and Brewster F2A Buffalo. LCDR Crommelin, in charge of the test, stated in a 1985 letter to George Skurla, Grumman president:\"for instance, I remember testing the XF5F against the XF4U on climb to the 10,000 foot level. I pulled away from the Corsair so fast I thought he was having engine trouble. The F5F was a carrier pilot's dream, as opposite rotating propellers eliminated all torque and you had no large engine up front to look around to see the LSO (landing signal officer) ... The analysis of all the data definitely favored the F5F, and the Spitfire came in a distant second. ... ADM Towers told me that securing spare parts ... and other particulars which compounded the difficulty of building the twin-engine fighter, had ruled out the Skyrocket and that the Bureau had settled on the Wildcat for mass production.\"Additional changes were needed after further flight tests that were not completed until 15 January 1942. In the meantime, Grumman began work on a more advanced twin-engine shipboard fighter, the XF7F-1, and further testing with the XF5F-1 supported the development of the newer design. The prototype continued to be used in various tests, although plagued by various landing gear problems, until it was struck from the list of active aircraft after it made a belly landing on 11 December 1944.\n\nThe XF5F Skyrocket was the only propeller fighter aircraft flown by the \"Blackhawk\"s in Quality Comics monthly title \"Military Comics\", which ran throughout World War II. The XF5F remained the \"Blackhawk\" Squadron's mount until their conversion to jet aircraft in Quality's retitled \"Modern Comics\" at the start of the jet age.\n\n"}

However, it eventually emerged Holt wasn't eligible for Canada, and Holt gained his first Scotland cap a year later.\n\nIn 2001, Norwich City paid £135,000 for Holt. He was voted Norwich City player of the year in 2001-02, when he also collected a number of fans' awards, including the Capital Canaries Player of the Season trophy. That season, Holt was a member of the Norwich team that reached the final of the Division One play-offs, losing on penalties to Birmingham City Holt played in Division One for his first three seasons with the club and helped them win promotion to the Premier League in 2004. \n\nHolt left Norwich to join Nottingham Forest in 2005, where he spent two years before being released at the end of the 2006-07 season. At Forest he scored three times, with goals against Weymouth in the FA Cup, Cheltenham in the league and Yeovil in the second leg of the 2007 League One play off semi final. \n\nHe subsequently signed for League Two side Wycombe Wanderers on 12 July 2007. He signed a 1-year extension until July 2010 on 17 January 2009. On 28 March 2009 he lobbed Luke Daniels in the League Two match against Shrewsbury Town to score the third goal of his Wycombe Wanderers career. For the 2009/10 season he left Wycombe Wanderers to join former manager Paul Lambert at Colchester United as a player coach. However, when Lambert left for Norwich City after only three game of the season, his contract was terminated without him making a single appearance for the club. On 6 October 2009 he signed for Isthmian League club Lowestoft Town.\n\nHolt made his Scotland debut on 2 September 2000 as an 89th-minute substitute against Latvia in a match that Scotland won 1-0. He kept his place in the squad for the next year and a half before he was omitted from after a friendly against France that ended in a 5-0 defeat for Scotland in March 2002. He was not capped again for two years when his final cap came in a 1-1 draw against Moldova in October 2004. His only international goal came in a 4-1 win over Trinidad & Tobago in 2004.\n\nIn July 2010, he returned to Norwich City as assistant Academy manager. He was responsible for the coaching of City's under-12 to under-16 age groups as well as assisting the current coaching staff with reserve team matters.\n\nHolt was appointed manager of Scottish First Division club Falkirk on 3 April 2013. Upon becoming the new manager of Falkirk, Holt expressed has delight at returning to a club that gave him one of the best days of his career'. Holt also credits former Norwich City manager and compatriot, Paul Lambert for helping him. Holt left Falkirk in June 2014 to take a position at Norwich City as a first-team coach. Holt left Norwich by mutual consent after the 2015–16 season.\n\nIn August 2018, he was appointed head coach of Scottish Premiership club Livingston, replacing former Scotland teammate Kenny Miller in the role. He was forced to take a temporary leave of absence from the role in August 2019 when he overexerted in a gym session and contracted rhabdomyolysis, causing his blood levels to rise to dangerous levels and his skeletal muscle to begin breaking down.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ettor is best remembered as a defendant in a controversial trial related to a killing in the seminal Lawrence Textile Strike of 1912, in which he was acquitted of charges of having been an accessory.\n\nJoseph James Ettor, known to his friends as \"Joe\" or \"Smiling Joe,\" was born on October 6, 1885 in New York City, the son of a laborer who had emigrated to America from Italy. Ettor went to work at the age of 12 selling newspapers. He later worked as a waterboy on a railroad, as a saw-filer in a lumber mill, as a barrel-maker, as a shipyard worker, and in a cigar factory.\n\nJoe Ettor went to work for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1906 as an organizer, continuing in that capacity for the next decade. An outstanding and inspirational public speaker who was fluent in Italian and English, Ettor's earliest organizing work on behalf of the IWW took place in the Western United States, where he had worked unionizing miners and migrant laborers. He also had cut his teeth organizing foreign-born workers in the steel mills and shoe factories of the East. Ettor was active in the 1907 lumber strike in Portland, Oregon, the 1909 McKees Rocks Strike and another lesser-known steel strike later that year in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, a strike of Pennsylvania coal miners in 1909-10, and a Brooklyn shoe factory strike in 1910-11.\n\nIn 1908, Ettor was named to the governing General Executive Board of the IWW, remaining in that capacity until 1914.\n\nOn January 1, 1912, in accordance with a new state law, the textile mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts posted new rules limiting the hours of workers to 54 a week, down from a standard of 56 previously in effect. It soon became clear that the employers had no intention of adjusting wage rates upwards to compensate for the lost work time, and a strike ensued.\nOn January 12, 1912, the Italian language branch of IWW Local 20 decided to send to New York City for Joe Ettor, the organization's top Italian language leader, to come to Lawrence and lead the strike. Ettor arrived with Arturo Giovannitti, secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation, a language federation of the Socialist Party of America and editor of the socialist newspaper \"Il Proletario\" [The Proletarian], who was not himself at the time a member of the IWW. Ettor instantly called on all his skills, including his ability to speak five languages, to rally the strikers. On his first afternoon in Lawrence, he addressed thousands of strikers, fostering solidarity and discouraging violence. \"All the blood that is spilled in a strike is your blood,\" he told strikers. Denouncing the mill owners, sympathizing with the toil of textile workers, Ettor called for an even larger walkout. \"Monday morning you have got to close the mills that you have caused to shut down, tighter than you have them now.\" Ettor then set up fourteen strike committees based on nationality, and began meeting daily with everyone from the mayor of Lawrence to the various strikers in committee. Mill owners instantly recognized Ettor's power and tried to discredit him by planting dynamite in a store where he picked up his mail. But the plot was quickly detected and Ettor continued organizing the strike.\n\nDuring the walkout, which came to be known as the Bread and Roses Strike, IWW striker Anna LoPizzo was shot and killed. Joseph Caruso was charged with the murder and Ettor and Giovannitti, both of whom were giving speeches several miles away from the crime scene, were arrested as accomplices. The three were eventually acquitted in a trial before Salem judge Joseph F. Quinn.\n\nEttor was one of the leaders of the Waiters strike of 1912 in New York City, and the Brooklyn barbers strike of 1913.\n\nThe question of violence was a perennial matter of discussion and debate within the IWW. Some, like Giovannitti, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and Vincent St. John, took the position that while the union did not favor violence, it would not shy away from its use if necessary to accomplish the social revolution. Ettor, on the other hand, shared the orientation of \"Big Bill\" Haywood that the only kind of force to which the organization could lend its name was the use of the general strike for the overthrow of capitalism.\n\nEttor became a member of the executive council of the IWW. In 1916, he left the IWW along with Flynn after a dispute over the Mesabi range strike.\n\nIn later years, Ettor ran a fruit orchard in San Clemente, California, where he died in 1948.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181181", "title": "Centranthus ruber", "text": "Centranthus ruber\n\nCentranthus ruber, also called red valerian, spur valerian, kiss-me-quick, fox's brush, devil's beard and Jupiter's beard, is a popular garden plant grown for its ornamental flowers.\n\nIt grows as a perennial plant, usually as a subshrub though it can take any form from a herb to a shrub depending on conditions; the plants are usually woody at the base. The leaves are generally 5–8 cm in length. Their form changes from the bottom to the top of the plant, the lower leaves being petiolate while the upper leaves are sessile. The leaves grow in opposite pairs and are oval or lanceolate in shape. The plant flowers profusely, and though the individual flowers are small (no more than 2 cm), the inflorescences are large and showy. The flowers are small in rounded clusters each with 5 fused petals and a spur. The most typical color is a brick red or purplish red, but colors include deep crimson, pale pink, and lavender. \"Centranthus ruber\" 'Albus' (about 10% of individuals) has white blooms. Flowering takes place in early summer and, in cool summer areas, continues sporadically throughout the summer and into fall. The cultivar 'coccineus' is especially long-blooming. The blooms have a strong and somewhat rank scent. They are pollinated by both bees and butterflies and the plant is noted for attracting insects. It is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades. Seeds have tufts similar to dandelions that allow wind dispersal, and as such can self-seed freely and become invasive if not properly controlled.\n\nA native of the Mediterranean region, \"Centranthus ruber\" has been introduced into many other parts of the world as a garden escape. It is naturalised in France, Australia, Great Britain, Ireland and the United States. In the US it can be found growing wild in such western states as Arizona, Utah, California, Hawaii, Washington, and Oregon, usually in disturbed, rocky places at elevations below 200 m. It is often seen by roadsides or in urban wasteland. It can tolerate very alkaline soil conditions. Because it can tolerate the lime in mortar, \"Centranthus ruber\" may frequently be seen growing in old walls in Italy, southern France and south-west England.\n\nBoth leaves and roots can be eaten, the leaves either fresh in salads or lightly boiled, the roots boiled in soups. Opinions differ as to whether either make very good eating, however. Although it is sometimes reported to have medicinal properties, there is no basis for this view, which is almost certainly due to confusion with true valerian, (\"Valeriana officinalis\").\n\nIt is listed as a NEMBA 1b invasive in the Western Cape, South Africa. It is an invasive species that may not be owned, imported into South Africa, grown, moved, sold, given as a gift or dumped in a waterway. It is therefore an Invasive species requiring compulsory control as part of an invasive species control programme to remove and destroy. The plants are deemed to have such a high invasive potential that infestations can qualify to be placed under a government sponsored invasive species management programme. No permits will be issued.\n\n"}

Giovannitti (1884, in Ripabottoni – 1959, in New York City) was an Italian-American union leader, socialist political activist, and poet. He is best remembered as one of the principal organizers of the 1912 Lawrence textile strike and as a defendant in a celebrated trial caused by that event.\n\nArturo Giovannitti was born January 7, 1884, in Ripabottoni in what is now the Province of Campobasso, Italy, at the time part of the Abruzzi but now part of Molise. He immigrated to Canada in 1900 and, after working in a coal mine and railroad crew, began preaching in a Presbyterian mission. He soon came to the United States, where he studied at Union Theological Seminary. Although he did not graduate, he ran rescue missions for Italians in Brooklyn and Pittsburgh. He also began writing for the weekly newspaper of the Italian Socialist Federation. In 1911, he became the newspaper's editor.\n\nOn January 1, 1912, in accordance with a new state law, the textile mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts posted new rules limiting the hours of workers to 54 a week, down from the previous 56. It soon became clear that the employers had no intention of adjusting wage rates upwards to make up for the lost work time, and a strike ensued.\n\nOn January 12, 1912, the Italian-language branch of the Industrial Workers of the World Local 20 decided to send to New York City for Joe Ettor, the organization's top Italian-language leader, to come to Lawrence and lead the strike. Within a few days, Ettor called his friend Giovannitti to Lawrence to coordinate relief efforts. Giovannitti soon began speaking to Italians. His most noted address was his \"Sermon on the Common,\" which modified Jesus's Beatitudes to decidedly less passive stances, such as \"Blessed are the rebels, for they shall reconquer the earth.\"\n\nOn January 29, a striker, Anna LoPizzo, was shot and killed during a police crackdown on an unruly mob. Although Ettor and Giovannitti were three miles from the scene, both were arrested and imprisoned, along with one other striker, on the charge of inciting a riot leading to the loss of life.\n\nWhile in jail, Giovannitti wrote many poems. By the time of the trial, that fall, several were published in leading journals, bringing him widespread fame. Giovannitti's poem \"The Walker,\" in which he recounted the tormented footsteps of a prisoner, brought him comparisons to Walt Whitman and Oscar Wilde.\n\nThe imprisonment of Ettor and Giovannitti became a cause célèbre, attracting nationwide attention and inspiring activists who called for the guaranteeing of free speech. Workers from across the US contributed to the Ettor-Giovannitti Defense Fund, which eventually totaled $50,000.\n\nThe trial of Ettor, Giovannitti, and the co-defendant accused of actually firing the shot that killed the picketer, began on September 30, 1912 in Salem, Massachusetts before Judge Joseph F. Quinn. As was the custom in capital cases in Massachusetts, the three defendants were kept in an open metal cage in the courtroom. The trial received coverage throughout North America and Europe. Prosecution witnesses quoted from speeches by Ettor and Giovannitti. Ettor: \"This town won't be very happy in two days. Something is going to happen... keep the gun shops busy...\" Giovannitti (to strikers): \"Prowl around like wild animals looking for the blood of the scabs.\" Yet defense witnesses testified without contradiction that Ettor and Giovannitti were miles away from the scene of the murder while Joseph Caruso, the third defendant in the case, was at home eating supper at the time of the killing.\n\nGiovannitti and Ettor both delivered closing statements at the end of the two-month trial. Giovannitti's speech brought many in the gallery to tears. Though he began by noting it was \"the first time in my life that I speak publicly in your wonderful language,\" he soon spoke eloquently about his love of life: \n\nI am twenty-nine years old. I have a woman that loves me and that I love. I have a mother and father that are waiting for me. I have an ideal that is dearer to me than can be expressed or understood. And life has so many allurements and it is so nice and bright and so wonderful that I feel the passion of living in my heart. \n\nYet if allowed to go free, he added, \n\nLet me tell you that the first strike that breaks again in this Commonwealth or any other place in America where the work and the help and the intelligence of Joseph J. Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti will be needed and necessary, there we shall go again regardless of any fear and any threat. We shall return again to our humble efforts, obscure, humble, unknown, misunderstood -- soldiers of this mighty army of the working class of the world, which out of the shadows and the darkness of the past is striving towards the destined goal which is the emancipation of human kind, which is the establishment of love and brotherhood and justice for every man and every woman in this earth.\n\nAll three defendants were acquitted, on November 26, 1912.\n\nIn the wake of the trial, Giovannitti published his first book of poems, \"Arrows in the Gale\", in 1914. In an introduction to the book, Helen Keller wrote: \"Giovannitti is, like Shelley, a poet of revolt against the cruelty, the poverty, the ignorance which too many of us accept.\" But Giovannitti, following ten months in prison, avoided involvement in volatile strikes. Instead, he devoted himself to poetry, editing radical journals and protesting World War I, which claimed two of his brothers.\n\nIn 1916, he participated in Percy MacKaye's production of \"Caliban by the Yellow Sands\", translating it into Italian. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he appeared at various workers' rallies, charming crowds with his Vandyke beard and flowery Italian and English.\n\nIn 1950, Giovannitti was stricken by paralysis in both legs. He remained bedridden until his death in the Bronx, in 1959.\n\nGiovannitti's papers, including a typescript play called \"The Alpha and the Omega (In Memory of a very Rich Holy Man)\", are housed at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\nTranslator:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181220", "title": "Danvers Opening", "text": "Danvers Opening\n\nThe Danvers Opening, also known as the Kentucky Opening, Queen's Attack, Queen's Excursion, Wayward Queen Attack, Patzer Opening or Parham Attack is an unorthodox chess opening characterized by the moves:\nLike many rare openings, 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 has acquired several names over the years, none of which are universally used. The earliest known appearance in print was in the Dubuque Chess Journal in May 1875, where it was dubbed the Kentucky Opening, perhaps in reference to a game played in Danville, Kentucky, which was published in the August issue of the same magazine. (This name was also applied by J. H. Blackburne to the unsound Jerome Gambit.) In the \"American Chess Bulletin\" in 1905, the opening was referred to as the Danvers Opening, so named by E. E. Southard, a well-known psychiatrist and a strong amateur chess player, after the hospital where he worked.\n\nBernard Parham of Indianapolis is the first master-level player known to have advocated this line. Parham is known for his eccentric theories on the game of chess, which he has developed into what he calls the \"Matrix System\". Parham's Matrix System advocates early development of the queen in several positions, as in his favored line as White against the Sicilian Defence, 1.e4 c5 2.Qh5?! Parham argues that just as Richard Réti and Aron Nimzowitsch pioneered the hypermodern style of chess, his own ideas which are considered strange today may well be considered viable in the future. Several internet-based sources refer to 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 as the Parham Attack or Parham Opening.\n\nThe most notable use of 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 by a grandmaster occurred in 2005, when U.S. Champion and future World Championship contender Hikaru Nakamura played it in two tournament games. The best known of these was against Indian GM Krishnan Sasikiran at the May 2005 Sigeman Tournament in Copenhagen/Malmö, Denmark. Nakamura got a reasonable position out of the opening but lost the game due to a mistake made in the middlegame. He later wrote on the Internet, \"I do believe that 2.Qh5 is a playable move, in fact I had a very good position in the game, and was close to winning if I had in fact played 23.e5.\" The previous month, Nakamura had played 2.Qh5 against GM Nikola Mitkov at the April 2005 HB Global Chess Challenge in Minneapolis. The game ended in a draw after 55 moves.\n\nMore often the opening is adopted by chess novices, as when actor Woody Harrelson played it against Garry Kasparov in a 1999 exhibition game in Prague. Harrelson achieved a draw after being assisted by several grandmasters who were in Prague attending the match between Alexei Shirov and Judit Polgár. The next year Kasparov again faced the opening as Black when tennis star Boris Becker played it against him in an exhibition game in New York. This time Kasparov won in 17 moves.\n\nThe Danvers Opening violates a conventional opening principle by developing the queen too early, subjecting it to attack (although it is relatively safe after retreating to f3). Nonetheless, the opening causes Black some problems. Left to his own devices, Black would probably develop with ...Nf6, ...Bc5, and ...Nc6. The Danvers Opening hinders this by forcing Black (unless he wants to sacrifice a pawn) to first defend the e-pawn (usually with 2...Nc6), then after 3.Bc4 to either play 3...g6 (virtually committing Black to fianchettoing his king bishop), 3...Qe7 (blocking the bishop), or 3...Qf6 (taking away the knight's best square). In 2005, the Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree called 2.Qh5 \"a provocative but quite sensible move\", and suspected it would have been effective because of its shock value.\n\nAs with the similar Napoleon Opening (2.Qf3?!), White hopes for the Scholar's Mate, e.g. 2.Qh5 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6?? 4.Qxf7#. In both cases, Black can easily avoid the trap, but 2.Qf3 does not pose the impediments to natural development of Black's pieces that 2.Qh5 does. \n\nBlack's worst possible response to 2.Qh5 is 2...Ke7?? 3.Qxe5#. (This line ties with a few others for the fastest possible checkmate by White.) Because most games with the Danvers Opening have been played at weak scholastic tournaments, 2...g6?? has often been seen, losing a rook and pawn to 3.Qxe5+. The two moves that have received attention from higher-level players are 2...Nc6 and 2...Nf6!?\n\nThis is the most common continuation. Black defends his e5-pawn from the queen and prepares to meet 3.Bc4 with 3...Qe7 (followed by ...Nf6) or 3...g6. The latter move is more common, however, and after 4.Qf3 Nf6 5.Ne2 the main position is reached (see diagram). White is not worse, but also has no advantage. Black can adopt different plans, one of the most popular being 5...Bg7, where 6.0-0 is White's best try for dynamic play, as 6.d3 d5 will lead to an even position with few attacking chances, and 6.Nbc3 Nb4 is interesting but promises little for White.\n\nGrandmasters Krishnan Sasikiran and Nikola Mitkov played this move against Hikaru Nakamura in 2005.\n\nIntroducing a speculative gambit called the Kiddie Countergambit. It is unnecessary to sacrifice a pawn for development, since the White queen will have to lose a eventually; however, FIDE Master Dennis Monokroussos advocates the move as the \"psychologically correct\" response.\n\nAnother common continuation, especially at beginner level. Black defends the center pawn and simultaneously guards the f7-pawn with a simple queen move. After 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Qd1 Nc6, Black may be slightly ahead in development, but the queen remains blocking their crucial kingside bishop, producing a roughly equal position. FIDE Master Vinay Matta once played this defense during a 2017 match against Nguyen Dat in the 28th Czech Open, scoring a draw with roughly equal gameplay.\n\n\n"}

Previous competitions include the Dublin and Belfast Intercity Cup 1941–42 to 1948–49, the North-South Cup 1961–62 to 1962–63, the Blaxnit Cup 1967–68 to 1973–74, the Texaco Cup 1973–74 to 1974–75, and the Tyler Cup 1978–1980. The inaugural cup was played between March and May 2005 at the start of the League of Ireland season and the end of the IFA Premiership season.\n\nThe competition was launched with Setanta providing support for prize money (€350,000) and sponsorship (€1.6 million over four years). In June 2009, the company went into administration and ceased broadcasting in Great Britain, putting the future of the competition in doubt. The draw for the 2009 tournament was postponed for a month but the competition eventually continued. The competition saw instances of crowd violence at its games since its inception.\n\nDuring the nine editions of the competition, the cup featured between six and twelve teams taking part. It began as a six-club competition called the \"Setanta Cup\" in 2005, before being expanded to eight clubs and renamed to the \"Setanta Sports Cup\" in 2006. The competition expanded again to nine clubs in 2009–10, and from 2011 until 2013 the competition was at its largest, with twelve clubs taking part. It was then reduced back to the 2006 number of eight clubs for the 2014 competition. The champions and runners-up from the respective leagues, and the winners of the respective cup competitions (FAI Cup and League of Ireland Cup from the League of Ireland, and the Irish Cup and NIFL Cup from the NIFL Premiership) qualified for the 2014 edition. If a club qualified via a cup win and would also have qualified by league table position, one of the spots would be awarded to the next highest club in the league table that had not already qualified. The 2014 competition was played in a two-legged knock-out tie format up until the final. All four clubs from each league participated in the quarter-finals, with clubs from the same association being kept apart in the draw. The quarter-final winners again played a two-legged knock-out tie in the semi-finals for a place in the final, which was a single game.\n\nThe 2014 competition was originally going to feature Linfield, who were inaugural winners of the competition in 2005 and had appeared in all eight competitions to date, and 2012–13 IFA Premiership champions Cliftonville. However, both clubs declined the invitation to take part, citing match scheduling and reduced prize money as their reasons for deciding not to enter. As a result, the fifth and sixth placed sides from the 2012–13 IFA Premiership, Ballinamallard United and Coleraine were invited to take their place, with both clubs accepting the invitation.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of Linfield from the 2014 competition, Glentoran became the only club to have entered all nine competitions since its inception. A total of 21 different clubs appeared in the competition - 9 different clubs from Northern Ireland and 12 different clubs from the Republic of Ireland. Of those 21 clubs, twelve different clubs reached the final but only seven of them went on to win the cup, and only two clubs won the cup more than once. In the nine competitions, seven of them were won by a club from the Republic of Ireland, with only two winners being from Northern Ireland. On four occasions, the cup was won by a club making their first appearance in the competition. Linfield won the cup in their first appearance - the inaugural 2005 competition. This feat was repeated by Drogheda United during their first appearance in 2006, and in 2007 they became the only club to successfully retain the cup, and the first of two clubs to win the cup more than once. The feat was also repeated by Bohemians during their first appearance in 2009–10, and by Shamrock Rovers, when they won the cup during their first appearance in 2011. In 2013, they went on to become the second club to win the cup more than once.\n\nFor the inaugural competition, it was known simply as the Setanta Cup. Qualification for the 2005 cup was based on the national league and cup performances in the respective countries - the top two in each league and the winners of the FAI Cup and Irish Cup qualified. Teams were split into two groups with the winner of each qualifying for the final. The 2005 competition saw Cork City, Longford and Shelbourne represent the League of Ireland, and Glentoran, Linfield and Portadown represent the IFA Premiership. The eventual winners of the Cup, Linfield, started the campaign poorly losing 2–1 to Longford before going on to win their remaining group matches and beating pre-tournament favourites Shelbourne.\n\nThe 2006 competition was renamed the Setanta Sports Cup, and featured four teams from each league with the winners of the respective secondary cup competitions, the League of Ireland Cup and Irish League Cup being added. The competition was organised with two groups of four teams. The top two teams in each group entered a semi-final round with the winner progressing to the final. The League of Ireland was represented by Cork City, Derry City, Shelbourne and Drogheda United with the IFA Premiership being represented by Linfield, Glentoran, Portadown and Dungannon Swifts. A total of 27 matches were played with the competition kicking off on Monday, 20 February 2006 with the final having been played on Saturday, 22 April 2006 at Tolka Park in Dublin. Drogheda United won, beating Cork City.\n\nThe draw for the 2007 competition was made on 7 December 2006 with the original competing teams being the identical ones to the previous year's competition. On 30 January 2007 however, Shelbourne announced that they were withdrawing from the competition for reasons relating to their financial troubles and the fact that they would be unlikely to field a team of players. Their place was given to the 2006 FAI Cup runners-up St Patrick's Athletic.\n\nThe first round of matches commenced on Monday, 26 February 2007. The prize of £100,000 was on offer to the eventual competition winner, with the runner-up to receive £55,000. Linfield progressed from the first stage after finishing top of Group 1, guaranteeing them a home semi-final, while Drogheda United finished behind them. This meant that Drogheda had to travel away from home to meet the winners of Group 2, who were St. Patrick's Athletic. Meanwhile, Cork City, who finished second in Group 2 had to travel to Windsor Park to play Linfield. Both Linfield and St. Patrick's Athletic went through the group stage without a single defeat, while St. Patrick's Athletic even won five of their six games. The final, between Linfield and Drogheda at Windsor Park was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Drogheda claimed the trophy for a second consecutive year thanks to two penalty saves from Mikko Vilmunen.\n\nThe draw for the 2008 competition was made on 17 January 2008, having been postponed since December 2007 to allow time for an agreement to be reached over the League of Ireland fixtures for 2008. For the third year in a row there were four representatives from each of the leagues with two from each league to be drawn in each group. In a change from previous years, the 2007 League of Ireland Cup winners played off against the winners of the 2007 League of Ireland First Division to decide the final League of Ireland place in the 2008 competition. As Derry City beat Cobh Ramblers 2–1 in the play-off on 19 November 2007, they claimed the remaining spot. The 2008 competition saw a change to the format with the first three group games in each group being played between late February and early April before the teams take a break from the competition until September. Between September and October the remaining group games and the semi-finals and final were played. The final took place on Saturday, 1 November 2008 at Turners Cross in Cork, where Cork City overcame Glentoran 2–1.\n\nThe 2009–10 season saw the competition expand to nine teams, including the holders, Cork City. There were three groups of three with the group winners and best runners-up qualifying for the semi-finals. The final took place on 15 May 2010 between Bohemians and St. Patrick's Athletic, the first final between teams from the same city. Bohemians won the match 1–0.\n\nThe 2011 competition kicked off on 14 February 2011 and concluded on 14 May 2011. It was played over four rounds, each round over two legs, except the final. The competition was again expanded - this time to twelve teams. Six League of Ireland and six IFA Premiership teams took part. Clubs who finished in the top four positions of both leagues qualified, along with the winners of the FAI Cup, League of Ireland Cup, Irish Cup and Irish League Cup competitions. The competition commenced on 14 February 2011, and ended with the final on 14 May 2011, which was played at the Tallaght Stadium, Dublin and was won by Shamrock Rovers. Milo Corcoran, Chairman of the Setanta Sports Cup Organising Committee said he believed the knock-out format would \"add even greater excitement to the tournament\".\n\nThe 2012 competition kicked off on 11 February 2012 and concluded with the final on 12 May 2012. Twelve clubs took part - six from each league. The two league winners, the FAI Cup winners, and the Irish Cup winners received a bye into the quarter-finals. The final was played at the Oval, Belfast and was won by Crusaders for the first time, defeating Derry City 5–4 on penalties after a 2–2 draw.\n\nThe 2013 competition kicked off on 11 February 2013 and concluded with the final on 11 May 2013. The competition again featured 12 clubs - six from each league. Cup holders Crusaders, 2012 FAI Cup winners Derry City, 2011–12 IFA Premiership champions Linfield and 2012 League of Ireland champions Sligo Rovers entered the competition in the quarter-finals, with the remaining eight clubs entering in the first round. The final was played at the Tallaght Stadium, Dublin and was won by Shamrock Rovers for the second time.\n\nThe 2014 competition kicked off on 24 February 2014, and concluded with the final on 10 May 2014. The competition was reduced in size back down to eight teams, and was originally going to feature Linfield, who were inaugural winners of the competition in 2005 and had appeared in all eight competitions to date, and 2012–13 IFA Premiership champions Cliftonville. However, in December 2013 both clubs declined the invitation to take part, citing match scheduling and reduced prize money as their reasons for deciding not to enter. As a result, the fifth and sixth placed sides from the 2012–13 IFA Premiership, Ballinamallard United and Coleraine were invited to take their place, with both clubs accepting the invitation. A prize fund of €73,000 was distributed in the competition. Sligo Rovers defeated Dundalk 1–0 in the final in Tallaght.\n\nThe competition was scheduled to go ahead in 2015 with four clubs taking part from each league. However, in May 2015, Northern Ireland Football League clubs initially voiced concerns over fixture scheduling – particularly plans for midweek games – raising doubts as to the competition's viability. When suitable fixture dates could not be agreed upon by the clubs, the 2015 competition was postponed until 2016. However, the issues were not resolved, and the tournament was not held in 2016 either. Principal sponsor, Setanta Sports, became Eir Sport after being acquired by Eir, and the competition was ultimately scrapped. \n\nIn May 2019, it was announced that a new competition, the Champions Cup, would take place between the winners from the Northern Ireland Football League and the League of Ireland. The contest will be a two-legged affair to be played in November 2019, with each team playing an away tie and a home tie.\n\n\"Years in Bold denote competition winner\"\n\n"}

The studios were moved into the same Holland, Michigan building as sister station WWJQ (now WPNW) but the transmitting tower remained in Zeeland along Interstate 196 near the 96th Avenue overpass until the early 1990s when it was moved three miles east to where 72nd Avenue would cross the highway.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the station (and its AM sister) promoted themselves as WJQ.\n\nIn 1997, the logo and nickname were changed to reflect the new moniker \"JQ 99\". A New Christian Hot AC/CHR format was introduced as well.\n\n2005 saw the tagline of \"Today's Best Christian Music\" replaced by \"Positive Hits\" as well as the move of the business office and studio from Holland to Zeeland.\n\nAt midnight on April 8, 2013, JQ99 relaunched as JQ99.3 after a full hour of stunting with old JQ99 jingles and liners. After that, the station started the launch by airing a 2.5 minute liner all about the old station, and telling listeners about the new rebrand, after which the new Toth was fired up, and the first song, Let My Words Be Few by Phillips, Craig and Dean. The last song played under the JQ brand was Blessed by Rachael Lampa. The new rebrand now plays music from 2000–present.\n\nThe new slogan is Energetic Positive Music, replacing Connected and growing from their previous JQ99 name. On May 1, 2013 the slogan was changed from Energetic Positive Music to Your Faith, Your Music.\n\nJQ99.3 was a reporter to Mediabase 24/7's Christian Adult Contemporary panel, until August 15, 2016.\n\nAt midnight on August 15, 2016 WJQK changed to Christian CHR as 99-3 JQK, GR's Positive Hits And Hip Hop, With the first song being Britt Nicole's \"Ready or Not\" featuring Lecrae. This is JQ's second attempt at Christian CHR, and the second time using Saint John as the imaging voice though he would be replaced with Josh Ashton and a new female voice by January 2017. The station also uses the B96 jingle package produced by Reelworld.\n\nOn January 1, 2018, with Chad Ericason as the new imaging voice, the new sound of JQ99.3 was launched. The station is once again a Christian CHR/Hot AC hybrid format just like 1997, with songs from 1990 until now, although the station is more current based rather than recurrents being heavily played. JQ99.3 is now a reporter to the Christian Hot AC bannal from Mediabase for the first time in its history.\n\nIn late 2018, JQ 99.3 performed another rebranding, this time as \"Joy 99.3\". The rebrand included a new jingle package with a female lead.\n\nLanser Broadcasting also owns WPNW. 99-3 JQK is a sponsor of the annual Unity Christian Music Festival.\n\nThe station operated a satellite studio, known as JQ2, in Holland's Westshore Mall until 2008.\n\n"}

{"id": "2181282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181282", "title": "Fantômette", "text": "Fantômette\n\nFantômette is a series of 52 volumes created in 1961 by Georges Chaulet. The books were destined for young readers and feature a female superhero named Fantômette. It was published in the \"Bibliothèque rose\" series from Hachette Editions. Fantomette's alter ego, Françoise Dupont, is a girl of about twelve years who dresses up in order to fight crime. She has two sidekicks: Ficelle, a tall and not-very-bright blonde, and Boulotte, a short and chubby brunette who is fixated on food. Neither of them are aware of her secret identity, despite meeting Fantômette regularly.\n\nFantômette was the first female superhero in French literature. The Fantômette books were aimed at eight- to twelve-year-old girls. There are 52 books in the series, which is still published today, as well as a comic book series by François Craenhals, a 1993 live-action TV series starring Katia Sourzac, and a cartoon series in 1998.\n\nIn 1957, the author, Georges Chaulet (1931–2012), proposed his first series, \"Les 4 As au collège\", to Hachette, one of the biggest French publishers. But Hachette refused, having just bought the rights to all of Enid Blyton's novels, most notably \"The Famous Five\". It was finally Casterman, a French-Belgian publisher, that published it. Very quickly, \"Les 4 As au collège\" was adapted as a comic book.\n\nStrengthened by this first success, George Chaulet then proposed a new series to Hachette, this time accepted: Fantômette was born. Forty-nine volumes were then published from 1961 to 1987 in the Bibliothèque rose series. In 2006, to celebrate the 150 years of the Bibliothèque rose and after an eighteen-year absence, Georges Chaulet wrote a new adventure for his favorite heroine: \"Le Retour de Fantômette\". He died on 13 October 2012, having written more than one hundred fifty books for youth in the course of his career.\n\nHere is the complete list of the \"Fantômette\" novels in their original order of publication:\n\nThe series was first adapted in 1993 (21 episodes of 24 minutes) starring Katia Sourzac. It uses the characters from the novel in original new adventures. The series was first aired on the French channels France 3 and Canal J on 20 April 1993.\n\n\nAn animated series of 26 episodes of 25 minutes each was produced in 1999. The settings are drastically different from the ones of the novels. The action takes place in an international metropolis named Furtive-Ville instead of the small fictive French city of Framboisy. The young characters have families, sometimes parents in the animated series when they had none and lived independently in the novels. (For example, Œil-de-Lynx becomes Ficelle and Boulotte's brother whereas in the books, there was absolutely no family bond between them at all). Françoise is even given a particularly dramatic family past (dead Egyptologists for parents), something that does not exist in the books. Boulotte lose her obsession with food, having instead a passion for animals, while Ficelle appear much more intelligent than in the novels.\n\nAs far as graphism goes, the Fantômette of the animated series is heavily influenced by the American animated series of the time such as \"\".\n\nA series of comic books following the original scenarios of Georges Chaulet was published from 1982 to 1985 for a total of four albums, drawn by François Craenhals for the first three albums and Endry for the last one.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The season produced eleven tropical cyclones, of which all eleven became tropical storms; six became hurricanes, and four of those strengthened into major hurricanes. The season's first storm developed on June 15 while the last storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 14. The most notable storm during the season formed in late August, while east of the Lesser Antilles. The hurricane devastated the Lesser Antilles, the Greater Antilles, and Mexico, leaving around 4,000 fatalities and more than $50 million (1909 USD) in damage.\n\nThe 1909 season was very deadly and destructive, featuring at least 4,673 fatalities, and $77.3 million, mostly due to the sixth and eighth hurricanes of the season. In mid-July, the fourth storm of the season hit Freeport, Texas, as a Category 3 hurricane, killing 41 people, and causing $2 million in damage. In mid-September, the eighth storm of the season made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, as a Category 3 hurricane, killing at least 350 people and causing $10 million in damage. The storm's storm surge is responsible for destroying thousands of homes, as it penetrated inland. In mid-October, the eleventh storm of the season developed, and tracked across Cuba, the Florida Keys, and the Bahamas as a Category 3 hurricane. At least $2 million in damage was caused, and at least 22 deaths were recorded. Lastly, the final storm of the season struck eastern Jamaica and Hispaniola as a hurricane before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone northeast of the Bahamas. The storm killed 198 people, and caused $7 million in damage.\n\nTropical cyclogenesis began on or shortly before June 15, when the first system was initially detected in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The month of June featured two other storms. One cyclone formed in July, the Velasco hurricane. August was the most active month, with four storms, including the Monterrey hurricane. There were two systems in September. The former, the Grand Isle hurricane, was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . October and November each featured one storm, the Florida Keys hurricane and the Greater Antilles hurricane, respectively. The twelfth and final cyclone of the season, the Greater Antilles hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the Atlantic Ocean to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles on November 14.\n\nThe season had a total of 12 tropical storms, 6 of which intensified into a hurricane. This was the most tropical storms in a season since the total of thirteen in 1901. The reanalysis from Christopher Landsea et al. in 2011 resulted in the addition of two tropical storms, which are listed as the first and seventh storms. In 1999, José F. Partagás and Henry F. Diaz uncovered evidence confirming the existence of a tropical system in November, while Landsea et al. upgraded the system from a tropical storm to a Category 2 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Additionally, the second storm of the second was also upgraded to a hurricane, increasing the number of landfalling hurricanes in the United States to five, the most in a season since 1893. All of the season's 12 tropical cyclones made landfall. Collectively, the storms caused over $77.3 million in damage and at least 4,673 fatalities.\n\nThe season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 93. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs.\n\nThe first tropical cyclone of the season was first identified as a tropical depression near the southeastern Nicaragua coastline on June 15. Tracking due north, the depression intensified into a tropical storm within 12 hours. Operationally, this system was not classified as a tropical storm as there was uncertainty of tropical storm-force winds being measured. Maintaining a slow, northward movement, the system attained peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). On June 18, it gradually turned towards the west, leading to the storm making landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, the following morning. Once overland, the storm weakened, first to a tropical depression before dissipating near the Nicaragua-Honduras border during the evening of June 19. Due to the weak nature of the system, little information was recorded on it. Throughout its existence, ships in the region suggested a minimum pressure of 1009 mbar (hPa; 29.80 inHg).\n\nIn late June, the season's second tropical cyclone developed near the Florida Keys. Its origins are unknown and the first indications of the system were as a tropical storm. After tracking northwest towards Louisiana for about a day. The system sharply changed direction and took a direct path towards the south Texas coastline. By June 29, it was estimated that the storm intensified into a minimal hurricane, attaining winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). However, reanalysis on the storm by Partagás in 1999 indicated that it was only a tropical storm. Shortly before the hurricane made landfall near Brownsville, Texas, it attained its peak intensity as a modern-day Category 2 cyclone with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). A barometric pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.70 inHg) was recorded as the storm moved inland. By June 30, the system weakened to a tropical storm and crossed into northern Mexico; the cyclone dissipated several hours later.\n\nUpon making landfall, the hurricane brought a storm surge exceeding , inundating low-lying coastal areas such as Padre Island. Winds up to were recorded as far north as Corpus Christi; however, no known winds were measured where the system made landfall. During a 24‑hour span, of rain fell in Mercedes, Texas. These heavy rains resulted in substantial flooding along the Rio Grande over the following week. Near Brownsville, a town in Mexico was mostly flooded after the river broke its banks on July 4. Floods persisted in the country through July 10, leaving behind substantial damage. Though no loss of life took place, total losses from the hurricane reached $1.3 million, almost all of which was attributed to destroyed railroads in Mexico.\n\nA tropical depression developed near Turks and Caicos Islands on June 26. Moving west-northwestward, the depression struck Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas. By 12:00 UTC the following day, the storm curved northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm. While situated near Andros around 12:00 UTC on June 28, the cyclone peaked with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). About eight hours later, it made landfall near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Cedar Key early on June 30, before making landfall near St. Marks close to 14:00 UTC with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Although the system quickly weakened to a tropical depression, it remained a tropical cyclone while moving in a semicircular path across the Southeastern United States. Early on July 3, the storm emerged into the Atlantic near Beaufort, South Carolina. Around this time, Charleston observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest in relation to the system. The storm moved east-southeastward and continued weakening, until dissipating between Bermuda and Grand Bahama late on July 4.\n\nIn Florida, the storm brought heavy rainfall to some areas. There was standing water on the streets of Bartow and Lakeland. In Tampa, winds exceeding shattered some windows. There was also \"considerable\" impact to crops and telegraph and telephone wires. Along the coast, several small crafts were damaged.\n\nThe Velasco Hurricane of 1909 <br>\n\nA tropical depression was first noted in close proximity to the Windward Islands on July 13. Remaining weak for the next few days, the system began to intensify after nearing Jamaica on July 17, when it became a tropical storm. Curving towards the northwest, the cyclone reached hurricane strength on July 18 near the western tip of Cuba. Intensification halted as it moved westwards across the Gulf of Mexico, but resumed as the hurricane approached the Texas coast. The storm deepened into a Category 3 hurricane on July 21 and subsequently reached its peak intensity with winds of . Shortly thereafter, the hurricane made landfall near Velasco, Texas. Once over land, the system began to quickly weaken, and dissipated near the Rio Grande on July 22.\n\nIn Cuba, the storm brought rough seas, strong winds, and persistently heavy rainfall over a period of two days, inundating the streets of Batabanó with about of water. A number of vessels also sank, but no fatalities occurred. In Texas, strong waves caused several offshore shipping incidents, and storm surge inundated areas of the Texas coast, though damage in Galveston was mostly mitigated by the Galveston Seawall. In Velasco, one of the hardest hit cities, only eight buildings remained intact after the hurricane. Strong winds forced train closures and destroyed and downed various infrastructure. Heavy rains further inland peaked at 8.5 in (220 mm) in Hallettsville. The hurricane caused 41 deaths and $2 million in damages in Texas.\n\nOn August 6, a new tropical depression was identified between Jamaica and Honduras. Tracking northwestward, the system gradually intensified, attaining tropical storm status near the Cayman Islands later that day. On August 7, the storm turned towards the west and reached its peak intensity just off the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a pressure of 1004 mbar (hPa; 29.65 inHg). Hours later, the cyclone made landfall near Cancún and weakened to a tropical depression hours later. Continuing westward, the system moved back over water on August 9, over the Bay of Campeche. Within hours of doing so, it re-attained tropical storm status as its forward motion quickly increased. During the afternoon of August 10, the storm made its final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, before rapidly dissipating over the mountainous terrain of Mexico later that day.\n\nThe Monterrey Hurricane of 1909 <br>\n\nOriginating from a tropical storm east of the Leeward Islands on August 20, the storm tracked west-northwest, entering the Caribbean Sea as a minimal hurricane the next day. After striking Hispaniola on August 23, the hurricane made another landfall in eastern Cuba before reentering the Caribbean. Once back over open water, the storm intensified into a Category 3 hurricane and moved across the northern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula. By August 26, the storm had emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a weakened but regrouping system. It attained its peak winds of 120 mph (185 km/h) that evening. Maintaining this intensity, the system made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas late on August 27 and rapidly dissipated the following afternoon.\n\nThroughout its existence, the hurricane remained relatively close to land, so consequently it effected many areas of the northern Caribbean Sea. Although the storm impacted several islands, only Haiti reported damage during the hurricane's passage. In northeastern Mexico, catastrophic flooding occurred due to the storm, especially in the city of Monterrey. In that city, more than half of the structures were flooded, hundreds were destroyed. and 20,000 people were left homeless. Throughout Mexico, reports indicated that 4,000 people were killed by the hurricane, making it the tenth deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record. Monetary losses were also estimated to have exceeded $50 million.\n\nA low pressure area formed over the central Gulf of Mexico between August 19 and August 20. Ships and weather maps indicate that a tropical depression developed from the low to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba at 00:00 UTC on August 22. The system moved northwestward and intensified into a tropical storm about 24 hours later. By 12:00 UTC on August 23, sustained winds were estimated to have peaked at 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm began curving to the west-southwest shortly thereafter. Late on August 24, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression while approaching the coast of Mexico, with the weakening probably caused by wind shear generated by the sixth storm. The cyclone made landfall in northern Tamaulipas near the United States border early the following day, and promptly dissipated. The highest wind speed observed on land was in New Orleans.\n\nA ship first indicated the presence of this storm about 60 mi (95 km) northeast of Samana Cay in the Bahamas on August 28. The cyclone moved west-northwestward and struck the southern end of Abaco Islands later that day. Early on August 9, the storm is estimated to have peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), based on a minimum barometric pressure of observed by a ship. The cyclone made landfall around 09:00 UTC near modern-day Boca Raton, Florida. Moving inland, the system weakened to a tropical depression early on August 30 while just to the west of Lake Okeechobee, where it began curving northwestward. Around midday, the cyclone turned northeastward. Late on August 30, the storm reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean and restrengthened into a tropical storm early the following day. The reintensification was short-lived, with the cyclone weakening to a tropical depression and dissipating about southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. \n\nThe Grand Isle Hurricane of 1909 <br>\n\nDuring early September, a tropical disturbance over the western Atlantic began to strengthen as it moved towards the Lesser Antilles. By September 13, the system had become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression. Moving west-northwestward, the depression attained tropical storm status near Jamaica on September 15 and hurricane intensity the following day. By September 18, the hurricane had attained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) as it moved over the western tip of Cuba. After briefly weakening due to its interaction with land, the storm re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, attaining winds of 120 mph (185 km/h), becoming the third major hurricane of the season. Maintaining this strength, the storm eventually made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, on September 21. Rapid weakening took place as it quickly moved northward, dissipating the following day over Missouri.\n\nIn western Cuba, the storm brought strong winds and heavy precipitation to several areas. Numerous buildings suffered severe damage and a large portion of the orange crop was lost. Ships were pushed onshore by the hurricane's large swells. Throughout Pinar del Río Province, damage was estimated at about $1 million. The steamship \"Nicholas Castina\" capsized near Isla de la Juventud, drowning at least 29 people. In the United States, the hurricane killed at least 350 people and wrought $10 million in damage. Thousands of homes were destroyed by the cyclone's powerful storm surge which penetrated inland. The states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama sustained the most severe damage, especially from strong winds which covered a large area.\n\nObservations from a ship and weather maps indicate that a tropical depression developed near the north coast of Isla de la Juventud on September 24. Moving northward, the depression soon struck the Caribbean coast of modern-day Artemisa Province in Cuba. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds were reported in the now defunct Santa Clara Province. The depression emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and failed to intensify further before making landfall near Naples, Florida late on September 25. Moving northeastward, the cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened into a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC on September 26. About 24 hours later, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Thereafter, the storm began weakening. However, on September 28, a ship observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest known in relation to the storm. Around 00:00 UTC on September 29, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression just west of Bermuda and dissipated shortly thereafter.\nKey West Hurricane of 1909 <br>\nThe storm was first detected in the Caribbean about 35 mi (55 km) northwest of Cartagena, Colombia, on October 6. Initially a tropical depression, the system became a tropical storm early on the next day while heading northwestward. By October 8, the storm became a Category 1 hurricane to the southwest of Jamaica. The hurricane curved west-northwestward and intensified throughout the next day, becoming Category 3 intensity late on October 9. The cyclone peaked with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) early on October 10. Later that day, it turned to the north and made landfall in Sandino, Pinar del Río Province. After traversing the western extremity of Cuba, the storm entered the Straights of Florida and turned northeastward. The hurricane made landfall near Marathon, Florida, late on October 11 with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Thereafter, the system weakened quickly while crossing the northwestern Bahamas and the western Atlantic, falling to tropical storm intensity late on October 12. About 24 hours later, it weakened to a tropical depression and then dissipated 200 mi (320 km) northeast of Bermuda.\n\nIn western Cuba, strong winds and large waves left severe damage. The cities of Cayuco and La Fe in Pinar del Río Province were completely destroyed, while Guane experienced considerable devastation and every house in Puerto Esperanza suffered damage due to strong winds. In Havana alone, the storm caused five fatalities and about $1 million in damage. The large waves reached the coast of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, causing many fishermen and their families to drown. In Key West, the streets became a \"mess of wreckage\", with at least 500 homes were destroyed and at least 400 buildings throughout the city being damaged or demolished. Overall, damage in Key West reached approximately $2 million and there were two fatal injuries. Worst damage in Key West since 1870 hurricanes. Damage to Keys railroad not as great as the similar 1906 hurricane storm. At several locations in the Florida Keys, the Florida East Coast Railway was damaged. Twelve deaths occurred at Bahia Honda Key after the tugboat \"Sybil\" wrecked there. In Marathon, the timekeeper drowned. In Miami, a number of structures were deroofed, while the newly built hotel suffered severe damage, but impact otherwise primarily limited to downed trees. Along its path, the storm killed 34 people.\nThe final storm of the season formed from a large weather system over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 8. Tracking northwestward, the system gradually intensified. On November 11, the storm brushed the eastern tip of Jamaica before attaining hurricane-status several hours later. During the afternoon of November 12, the hurricane made landfall in northeastern Haiti with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) before entering the Atlantic Ocean. Once in the Atlantic, the storm further intensified to attain peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) on November 13 as it accelerated eastward. The system rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the following day before being absorbed by a frontal system northeast of the Lesser Antilles.\n\nIn Jamaica, torrential rains from the storm, peaking at at Silver Hill Plantation, wrought widespread damage. Throughout the country, roughly 500,000 banana plants were lost as a result of the floods, about 20% of the entire country's yield. The storm left 30 people dead and $7 million in damage. Nearby Haiti suffered more severe losses from the storm, with 166 people confirmed to have died and hundreds other presumed dead. Additionally, damage reached at least $3 million. Widespread flooding and landslides destroyed entire villages and ruined transportation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181307", "title": "Giorgi Saakadze", "text": "Giorgi Saakadze\n\nGiorgi Saakadze the Grand Mouravi () (c. 1570 – October 3, 1629) was a Georgian politician and military commander who played an important but contradictory role in the politics of the early 17th-century Georgia. He was also known as Grand Mouravi (დიდი მოურავი, \"didi mouravi\") in Georgia, Mūrāv-Beg in Persia and Māūrāv-Hūn or Māġrāv-Bek in the Ottoman Empire for having served as a mouravi (appointed royal official which can be rendered by seneschal or bailiff) of Tbilisi.\n\nGiorgi Saakagze was born in 1570 in Noste village (Peli village by other sources), near the town on Kaspi. Saakadze's family came of the untitled nobility (\"samepo aznauri\"). His father, Siaush, rose in prominence through a loyal service to King Simon I of Kartli, whom Giorgi joined in military service in his early career. Under the young king Luarsab II, he was appointed a mourav of Tbilisi, Tskhinvali, and Dvaleti in 1608. Saakadze's influence and prestige especially grew after he destroyed an Ottoman invasion force at the battle of Tashiskari in June 1609, thereby saving Luarsab from being dislodged. In 1611, the king married Saakadze's sister, Macrine, annoying the great nobles, who grew increasingly suspicious of the ambitious and aspiring officer who had had risen from the ranks of the petty nobility to become the most powerful man in Kartli. The animosity between the two nobles parties centered on the princes P’arsadan Tsitsishvili and Shadiman Baratashvili on one hand, and Saakadze on the other. The nobles convinced Luarsab that Saakadze was an Iranian traitor, prompting him to divorce Macrine and authorize a plot to kill him in May 1612. Saakadze escaped the trap and defected to Iran. Having converted to Islam and displayed his military ability in Iran's war with the Ottomans, he quickly won the confidence of Shah Abbas I of Iran and was regularly consulted on the Georgian affairs.\n\nIn 1614, Saakadze avenged Luarsab and his nobles by aiding Shah Abbas in the invasion of Georgia which brought Luarsab's reign to an end, but dissuaded the Iranians from committing atrocities in Kartli after the nation surrendered. In 1619, the shah appointed him a vekil (regent) to Bagrat Khan, the Iranian nominee to the throne of Kartli. Saakadze turned into a de facto ruler of Kartli. Once the hostilities with the Ottomans resumed, Saakadze served as one of the leading commanders in the shah's ranks from 1621 to 1623. His military exploits led Abbas to appoint him to the staff of Qarachaqay Khan who led a 35,000-strong army to crush the rebellion in Georgia. Saakadze then discovered that the Shah planned to massacre all armed Kartlians, including himself. He conspired with the rebel leaders – his brother-in-law Zurab of Aragvi and king Teimuraz I of Kakheti – and ambushed the Iranian army at Martqopi on March 25, 1625, inflicting a decisive defeat on it. Saakadze went on to annihilate the Turkic nomads transplanted by the Iranian government to replace the exiled Georgian population, dislodged the shah's governor Paykar Khan from Kakheti and raided the Iranian garrisons as far as Ganja and Karabakh. In an act of revenge, Shah Abbas put Saakadze's younger son, Paata, to death, and sent his severed head to the Georgians. The punitive Iranian expedition followed soon thereafter, and won a costly victory over the Georgians at the Battle of Marabda. Saakadze withdrew into the mountains, and organized a powerful guerrilla resistance which forced Abbas I to recognize Teimuraz's royal status.\n\nThe unity of Georgian nobles quickly collapsed, however. Saakadze's opposition to Teimuraz's control of Kartli led to a bitter conflict which culminated in the fratricidal battle of Bazaleti in the fall of 1626. The royal army won a victory, driving Saakadze into exile to Istanbul where he entered the service of Sultan Ibrahim I. He briefly served as a governor of the Konya Vilayet and fought against the Iranians at Erzurum (1627-1628), and in Meskheti (1628). However, Grand Vizier Ekrem Hüsrev Pasha soon accused Saakadze of treason and had him, along with his son Avtandil, Kaikhosro, Prince of Mukhrani, and other Georgians, put to death at Constantinople on October 3, 1629.\n\nSaakadze's last surviving son, Ioram, later attained to the princely rank in Georgia, and founded the Tarkhan-Mouravi noble family.\n\nSaakadze's controversial career has always been a source of conflicting perceptions of his role in Georgia's history. The traditional historiography of Georgia, heavily influenced by Prince Vakhushti and Marie Brosset, continued to view him as a feudal adventurer and ambitious warlord involved in the turbulent whirl of intrigues and disturbances which fill the history of seventeenth-century Georgia.\n\nThe first attempt at the rehabilitation of Saakadze was made by his relative Metropolitan Joseph of Tbilisi in his poem The Grand Mouravi (დიდმოურავიანი, \"didmouraviani\"; 1681–87). Beginning from the early 20th century, some Georgian authors have also tried to emphasize the positive aspects of Saakadze's biography, particularly his contribution to the 1625 rebellion which frustrated Shah Abbas's plan to convert eastern Georgian lands into the Qizilbash khanates.\n\nIn the 1940s, Joseph Stalin’s wartime propaganda established Saakadze as a major symbol of Georgian patriotism. In October 1940, Stalin commented on Saakadze, proclaiming that the Grand Mouravi’s hopes for Georgia’s \"unification into one state through the establishment of royal absolutism and of the liquidation of the power of the princes\" had been progressive. In an apparent move to encourage Georgian nationalism in order to gain the loyalty of the population during the war with Germany, Stalin himself was involved in modifying the script for an epic movie, \"Giorgi Saakadze\", commissioned from the Georgian film director Mikheil Chiaureli in 1942-1943. Stalin dismissed a script by the Georgian writer Giorgi Leonidze and approved the one by Anna Antonovskaya and Boris Chenry, adopted from Antonovskaya's 1942 Stalin Prize-winning six-volume novel, \"The Great Mouravi\" ().\n\nThe film emphasized that Saakadze, initially an obscure squire, was a victim of machinations at the hands of the wealthy feudal lords who would sacrifice everything, including their motherland, for their own benefit. It intentionally avoided any mention of Saakadze's own adventures and illustrated him as a popular leader against the external aggressors. In the atmosphere of suspicion and spy mania in the Soviet Union during these years, the movie also served to current propaganda by emphasizing that the treason threatening to the popular leader, and hence to the country, was to be punished cruelly. Ironically, Giorgi Saakadze was also the name of the Wehrmacht's 797th Battalion, one of Georgian battalions formed by the Germans to fight the Soviet Union.\n"}

He was one of the cricketing heart-throbs of his day.\n\nPhadkar was educated in Bombay in the Robert Money High School and took a B.A. degree from Elphinstone College. At the age of 10, he scored 156 in an inter-school match. He represented Bombay University at cricket between 1941/42 and 1946/47. On his collegiate debut, he hit 274, which was then a record. He underwent training at Alf Gover's cricket school.\n\nPicked for the Indian tour of Australia in 1947/48, Phadkar shone more with the bat than the ball. On his debut on a difficult wicket at Sydney he hit 51 while batting at eight and took 3 for 14. Promoted to No.6, he scored 123 at Adelaide and added a record 188 for the sixth wicket with Vijay Hazare. Phadkar went on to top the batting averages and scored at least a fifty in all the four Tests that he played. \n\nNext year against West Indies at Madras, Phadkar took 7 for 159 which remained his best figures in Tests.

Nash had previously been tag team champion six times with Scott Hall and once with Sting while Page's two other reigns were as part of the Jersey Triad with Kanyon and Bam Bam Bigelow.\n\nNash and Page's connection began while both were performing for WCW in 1991. Nash, who at the time was known as Vinnie Vegas, joined Page's continuation of his American Wrestling Association stable, the Diamond Exchange (known in WCW as the \"Diamond Mine\"). Nash's stablemates were Scott Hall, who was wrestling as the Diamond Studd at the time, and Scott Levy, who was known as Scotty Flamingo. After Hall left for the World Wrestling Federation at the end of the year, the remaining members of the group became known as the Vegas Connection as Page and Vegas would team and accompany Flamingo to the ring. This incarnation was short-lived, as Page suffered a torn rotator cuff in a match against Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce in late 1992. Following the injury Nash and Levy left for the WWF, while Page was fired. While the three men would later wrestle in WCW at the same time once Levy— under his more popular name, Raven— rejoined WCW in 1997, there was no further effort made to team the three (although Nash had tried several times to recruit Page into the nWo once he made his return to the company in 1996).\n\nIn late 2000, after The Natural Born Thrillers turned on Kevin Nash, DDP and Nash reformed their team and called themselves The Insiders, a play on Nash's team with Scott Hall, The Outsiders, and the reportedly close friendships each man had with WCW officials, particularly Eric Bischoff.

He played as a shortstop and third baseman in Major League Baseball from to . Harrah played for the Texas Rangers both before (Washington Senators era) and after their 1971 franchise shift. He also played for the Cleveland Indians and the New York Yankees. In 1992, he briefly served as manager of the Rangers. Harrah most recently served as the assistant hitting coach for the Detroit Tigers.\n\nHarrah played high school baseball in his hometown of LaRue, Ohio and was scouted out but was not signed at graduation as most scouts thought he planned to attend college on a baseball scholarship. A few months later, Tony Lucadello followed up and found that Harrah was not attending school, but was instead working in a factory in nearby Marion, Ohio. Lucadello signed Harrah for the Philadelphia Phillies in December, .\n\nAfter one year in the Phillies organization, Harrah was drafted by the Washington Senators in the fall of . He advanced to the major league club in ; the next year the franchise relocated and became the Texas Rangers. He was the regular shortstop through , then moved to third base, although he still saw some action at short. He was selected to the American League All-Star team in , , and . He had a career best 93 RBIS in 1975. On June 25, 1976, Harrah played an entire doubleheader at shortstop without recording a single chance in the field. The following season he and teammate Bump Wills would hit back-to-back inside-the-park home runs.\n\nIn , Harrah was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Buddy Bell, a player thought to be fairly similar in many respects. He was the Indians' regular third baseman through and made the All-Star team in . That year he had 100 runs and a career-best .304 batting average.\n\nIn , Harrah was traded to the New York Yankees, where he was a part-time player, then he was traded again to the Rangers, where he played regularly again for the and seasons, primarily at second base. With the retirement of Jeff Burroughs in 1985, Harrah became the last active major leaguer to have played for the Washington Senators franchise. He was also the last player to see a pitch for the Senators in their final game on September 30, 1971 when Tommy McCraw was caught stealing during his plate-appearance for the Senators final out in the bottom of the 8th.\n\nHarrah was noted for his good eye at the plate, placing in the top ten in the league for bases on balls on nine occasions, including an AL-best 109 in 1977. He finished his career with more bases on balls than strikeouts, with 1153 and 868, respectively. He also had better than average power for a defensive infielder, hitting 195 career home runs. Combined with good speed, he accumulated three seasons of 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases. Harrah's on-base skills and respectable slugging ability led to a solid career Adjusted OPS of 114.\n\nAccording to sabermetrician Jay Jaffe of Baseball Prospectus, Harrah is the 25th best third baseman in Major League Baseball history, outpacing several Hall of Famers. Despite his superior statistical accomplishments, Harrah only received a single vote for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992, thereby removing his name from future ballots. Harrah's chances for the Hall were seemingly hurt by his multiple position switches: from shortstop, to third base, to second base, and often back and forth. He did not match the awards or \"counting stats\" (avg, HR, RBI) of well-hitting contemporary shortstops like Cal Ripken Jr. and Barry Larkin, or third baseman such as Wade Boggs or George Brett, all of whom were on their way to HOF careers by the time Harrah was eligible in 1992. Contemporary baseball historians have placed more value on Harrah's career after the fact, noting that he was a solid all-around player who placed among the league leaders in Wins Above Replacement on 5 occasions.\n\nIn 2009, Harrah was named to the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame.\n\nHarrah has played 1099 games at third base, 813 games at shortstop, 244 games at second base and 1 game in right field.\n\nFollowing his playing career, Harrah moved on to coaching in professional baseball. From 1987 to 1988 he managed the Triple A Oklahoma City 89ers. From 1989 to 1991 he served as the first base coach for the Texas Rangers under manager Bobby Valentine. In 1992 he shifted to bench coach under Valentine then replaced him as manager with 76 games left to go in the season. As interim manager, the Rangers under Harrah went 32-44.\n\nIn 1995 Harrah managed the Triple A Norfolk Tides to an 86-56 record, finishing in first place in the International League East Division. In 1996 he served as the third base coach for the Cleveland Indians under Mike Hargrove, replacing Buddy Bell, who had been named manager of the Detroit Tigers. In 1997, he served as a minor league hitting coach within the Tigers organization. In 1998 he joined the Tigers major league club as hitting coach, serving under manager Bell and interim manager Larry Parrish, both teammates of Harrah with the Rangers in the mid 1980s. When Bell was hired as the manager of the Colorado Rockies in 2000, Harrah joined him once again by serving as bench coach through the 2002 season.\n\nIn 2004, Harrah was named minor league hitting coordinator for the Tigers, where he worked with players at all levels as a roving instructor. He remained in that position until part way through the 2012 season.\n\nIn June 2012, Harrah joined the Detroit Tigers major league coaching staff in an unofficial capacity. Tigers manager Jim Leyland noted that with so many players struggling at once, hitting coach Lloyd McClendon had been stretched thin. The notion of two hitting coaches had been recommended to Leyland by friend and former colleague Tony La Russa. LaRussa had been the first to adopt a two-coach system when he named an assistant hitting coach, (Mike Aldrete), with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2008. In the month following Harrah's arrival, the Tigers offense increased their average runs per game from 4.3 to 5.6.\n\nFollowing the 2012 season, Harrah was officially named assistant hitting coach by the Tigers for the 2013 season. Following the 2013 season and the retirement of Tigers manager Jim Leyland, Harrah was informed that his contract would not be renewed.\n\n"}

{"id": "2181360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181360", "title": "Tarski's axioms", "text": "Tarski's axioms\n\nTarski's axioms, due to Alfred Tarski, are an axiom set for the substantial fragment of Euclidean geometry that is formulable in first-order logic with identity, and requiring no set theory (i.e., that part of Euclidean geometry that is formulable as an elementary theory). Other modern axiomizations of Euclidean geometry are Hilbert's axioms and Birkhoff's axioms.\n\nEarly in his career Tarski taught geometry and researched set theory. His coworker Steven Givant (1999) explained Tarski's take-off point:\nGivant then says that \"with typical thoroughness\" Tarski devised his system:\n\nLike other modern axiomatizations of Euclidean geometry, Tarski's employs a formal system consisting of symbol strings, called sentences, whose construction respects formal syntactical rules, and rules of proof that determine the allowed manipulations of the sentences. Unlike some other modern axiomatizations, such as Birkhoff's and Hilbert's, Tarski's axiomatization has no primitive objects other than \"points\", so a variable or constant cannot refer to a line or an angle. Because points are the only primitive objects, and because Tarski's system is a first-order theory, it is not even possible to define lines as sets of points. The only primitive relations (predicates) are \"betweenness\" and \"congruence\" among points.\n\nTarski's axiomatization is shorter than its rivals, in a sense Tarski and Givant (1999) make explicit. It is more concise than Pieri's because Pieri had only two primitive notions while Tarski introduced three: point, betweenness, and congruence. Such economy of primitive and defined notions means that Tarski's system is not very convenient for \"doing\" Euclidean geometry. Rather, Tarski designed his system to facilitate its analysis via the tools of mathematical logic, i.e., to facilitate deriving its metamathematical properties. Tarski's system has the unusual property that all sentences can be written in universal-existential form, a special case of the prenex normal form. This form has all universal quantifiers preceding any existential quantifiers, so that all sentences can be recast in the form formula_1 This fact allowed Tarski to prove that Euclidean geometry is decidable: there exists an algorithm which can determine the truth or falsity of any sentence. Tarski's axiomatization is also complete. This does not contradict Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, because Tarski's theory lacks the expressive power needed to interpret Robinson arithmetic .\n\nAlfred Tarski worked on the axiomatization and metamathematics of Euclidean geometry intermittently from 1926 until his death in 1983, with Tarski (1959) heralding his mature interest in the subject. The work of Tarski and his students on Euclidean geometry culminated in the monograph Schwabhäuser, Szmielew, and Tarski (1983), which set out the 10 axioms and one axiom schema shown below, the associated metamathematics, and a fair bit of the subject. Gupta (1965) made important contributions, and Tarski and Givant (1999) discuss the history.\n\nThese axioms are a more elegant version of a set Tarski devised in the 1920s as part of his investigation of the metamathematical properties of Euclidean plane geometry. This objective required reformulating that geometry as a first-order theory. Tarski did so by positing a universe of points, with lower case letters denoting variables ranging over that universe. Equality is provided by the underlying logic (see First-order logic#Equality and its axioms). Tarski then posited two primitive relations:\n\nBetweenness captures the affine aspect of Euclidean geometry; congruence, its metric aspect. The background logic includes identity, a binary relation. The axioms invoke identity (or its negation) on five occasions.\n\nThe axioms below are grouped by the types of relation they invoke, then sorted, first by the number of existential quantifiers, then by the number of atomic sentences. The axioms should be read as universal closures; hence any free variables should be taken as tacitly universally quantified.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the congruence relation formula_5 is, formally, a 4-way relation among points, it may also be thought of, informally, as a binary relation between two line segments formula_6 and formula_7. The \"Reflexivity\" and \"Transitivity\" axioms above, combined, prove both:\n\nThe \"transitivity\" axiom asserts that congruence is Euclidean, in that it respects the first of Euclid's \"common notions\".\n\nThe \"Identity of Congruence\" axiom states, intuitively, that if \"xy\" is congruent with a segment that begins and ends at the same point, \"x\" and \"y\" are the same point. This is closely related to the notion of reflexivity for binary relations.\n\nThe only point on the line segment formula_15 is formula_16 itself.\nThe two diagonals of the quadrilateral formula_18 must intersect at some point.\nLet φ(\"x\") and ψ(\"y\") be first-order formulae containing no free instances of either \"a\" or \"b\". Let there also be no free instances of \"x\" in ψ(\"y\") or of \"y\" in φ(\"x\"). Then all instances of the following schema are axioms:\nLet \"r\" be a ray with endpoint \"a\". Let the first order formulae φ and ψ define subsets \"X\" and \"Y\" of \"r\", such that every point in \"Y\" is to the right of every point of \"X\" (with respect to \"a\"). Then there exists a point \"b\" in \"r\" lying between \"X\" and \"Y\". This is essentially the Dedekind cut construction, carried out in a way that avoids quantification over sets.\n\nThere exist three noncollinear points. Without this axiom, the theory could be modeled by the one-dimensional real line, a single point, or even the empty set.\n\nThree points equidistant from two distinct points form a line. Without this axiom, the theory could be modeled by three-dimensional or higher-dimensional space.\n\nEach of the three variants of this axiom, all equivalent over the remaining Tarski's axioms to Euclid's parallel postulate, has an advantage over the others:\n\nLet a line segment join the midpoint of two sides of a given triangle. That line segment will be half as long as the third side. This is equivalent to the interior angles of any triangle summing to two right angles.\n\nGiven any triangle, there exists a circle that includes all of its vertices.\nGiven any angle and any point \"v\" in its interior, there exists a line segment including \"v\", with an endpoint on each side of the angle.\n\n\nBegin with two triangles, \"xuz\" and \"x'u'z'.\" Draw the line segments \"yu\" and \"y'u',\" connecting a vertex of each triangle to a point on the side opposite to the vertex. The result is two divided triangles, each made up of five segments. If four segments of one triangle are each congruent to a segment in the other triangle, then the fifth segments in both triangles must be congruent.\n\nThis is equivalent to the side-angle-side rule for determining that two triangles are congruent; if the angles \"uxz\" and \"u'x'z'\" are congruent (there exist congruent triangles \"xuz\" and \"x'u'z'\"), and the two pairs of incident sides are congruent (\"xu ≡ x'u'\" and \"xz ≡ x'z'\"), then the remaining pair of sides is also congruent (\"uz ≡ u'z\"'). \n\n\nFor any point \"y\", it is possible to draw in any direction (determined by \"x\") a line congruent to any segment \"ab\".\n\nStarting from two primitive relations whose fields are a dense universe of points, Tarski built a geometry of line segments. According to Tarski and Givant (1999: 192-93), none of the above axioms are fundamentally new. The first four axioms establish some elementary properties of the two primitive relations. For instance, Reflexivity and Transitivity of Congruence establish that congruence is an equivalence relation over line segments. The Identity of Congruence and of Betweenness govern the trivial case when those relations are applied to nondistinct points. The theorem \"xy\"≡\"zz\" ↔ \"x\"=\"y\" ↔ \"Bxyx\" extends these Identity axioms.\n\nA number of other properties of Betweenness are derivable as theorems including:\nThe last two properties totally order the points making up a line segment.\n\nUpper and Lower Dimension together require that any model of these axioms have a specific finite dimensionality. Suitable changes in these axioms yield axiom sets for Euclidean geometry for dimensions 0, 1, and greater than 2 (Tarski and Givant 1999: Axioms 8, 8, 9, 9, 9 ). Note that solid geometry requires no new axioms, unlike the case with Hilbert's axioms. Moreover, Lower Dimension for \"n\" dimensions is simply the negation of Upper Dimension for \"n\" - 1 dimensions.\n\nWhen the number of dimensions is greater than 1, Betweenness can be defined in terms of congruence (Tarski and Givant, 1999). First define the relation \"≤\" (where formula_27 is interpreted \"the length of line segment formula_28 is less than or equal to the length of line segment formula_29\"):\nIn the case of two dimensions, the intuition is as follows: For any line segment \"xy\", consider the possible range of lengths of \"xv\", where \"v\" is any point on the perpendicular bisector of \"xy\". It is apparent that while there is no upper bound to the length of \"xv\", there is a lower bound, which occurs when \"v\" is the midpoint of \"xy\". So if \"xy\" is shorter than or equal to \"zu\", then the range of possible lengths of \"xv\" will be a superset of the range of possible lengths of \"zw\", where \"w\" is any point on the perpendicular bisector of \"zu\".\n\nBetweenness can then be defined by using the intuition that the shortest distance between any two points is a straight line:\n\nThe Axiom Schema of Continuity assures that the ordering of points on a line is complete (with respect to first-order definable properties). The Axioms of Pasch and Euclid are well known. Remarkably, Euclidean geometry requires just the following further axioms:\nLet \"wff\" stand for a well-formed formula (or syntactically correct formula) of elementary geometry. Tarski and Givant (1999: 175) proved that elementary geometry is:\nGupta (1965) proved the above axioms independent, \"Pasch\" and \"Reflexivity of Congruence\" excepted.\n\nNegating the Axiom of Euclid yields hyperbolic geometry, while eliminating it outright yields absolute geometry. Full (as opposed to elementary) Euclidean geometry requires giving up a first order axiomatization: replace φ(\"x\") and ψ(\"y\") in the axiom schema of Continuity with \"x\" ∈ \"A\" and \"y\" ∈ \"B\", where \"A\" and \"B\" are universally quantified variables ranging over sets of points.\n\nHilbert's axioms for plane geometry number 16, and include Transitivity of Congruence and a variant of the Axiom of Pasch. The only notion from intuitive geometry invoked in the remarks to Tarski's axioms is triangle. (Versions B and C of the Axiom of Euclid refer to \"circle\" and \"angle,\" respectively.) Hilbert's axioms also require \"ray,\" \"angle,\" and the notion of a triangle \"including\" an angle. In addition to betweenness and congruence, Hilbert's axioms require a primitive binary relation \"on,\" linking a point and a line. The Axiom schema of Continuity plays a role similar to Hilbert's two axioms of Continuity. This schema is indispensable; Euclidean geometry in Tarski's (or equivalent) language cannot be finitely axiomatized as a first-order theory. Hilbert's axioms do not constitute a first-order theory because his continuity axioms require second-order logic.\n\nThe first four groups of axioms of Hilbert's axioms for plane geometry are bi-interpretable with Tarski's axioms minus continuity.\n\n\n"}

The 2008 campaign consisted of videos posted on YouTube and MySpace to promote voting and the 2011 campaign featured a bondage-themed photo series comparing not voting to restricting yourself. In 2011, Declare Yourself merged with another campaign to form the nonprofit, Our Time.\n\nThe DOI Road Trip's stated mission was to engage and energize all Americans, particularly young people, by bringing the Declaration to them. According to a press release, \"This non-profit nonpartisan project hopes to inspire Americans to participate in civic activism, to exercise their rights and to vote. The Declaration of Independence Road Trip will travel to cities and towns across the United States, creatively combining elements of education, entertainment, and community outreach.\"\n\nFounded by TV producer and philanthropist Norman Lear, and led by Honorary Co-Chairs and former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, \"Declare Yourself\" is described in their literature as a \"national nonpartisan, nonprofit campaign initiated in 2004 to energize and empower a new movement of young voters to participate in the 2004 presidential election.\" From January through Election Day 2004, over one million young and first-time voters registered to vote through events at Declare Yourself's spoken word and music tour of college campuses.\n\nDeclare Yourself revved up its campaign again in 2007 for the 2008 presidential primaries and general election. This campaign is focusing on viral videos on video sharing sites like YouTube, MySpace, Break.com, and Daily Motion. The videos feature actors from the popular TV shows \"Reno 911!\" and \"The Office\", and the movie \"Superbad\".\n\nIn 2006, three public service announcements (PSAs) were released, each directed by David LaChapelle. They pretend to be clichéd commercials for different products but all end with the same ending: Silence. After the image, there's an eerie silence as the words \"Only You Can Silence Yourself\" appear, followed by a voice whispering \"Register to vote now.\"\n\nDog Food\n\nAn innocent-looking dog food ad where woman comments how her dog has not a care in the world and chooses the brand \"Apathy\" and hopes that she'll be like the dog and be taken care of herself. Suddenly we cut to an image of her on all fours with a muzzle on.\nWatch Dog Food PSA on YouTube\n\nPhat Ride\n\nA typical ad in the style of \"Pimp My Ride\", when it ends as a mechanic has nailed his mouth shut. Watch Phat Ride PSA on YouTube\n\nVanity\n\nA commercial which advertises a lipstick called \"Lip-Sealer\" with the cliché of a model posing with a voice over. Suddenly, the model's lips have been glued shut as she tries to speak, but is only able to mumble. Distorted voices are also heard.\nWatch Vanity PSA on YouTube\n\nThe Man\n\nIn 2007 Declare Yourself shot another series of PSAs starring Ben Garant and Tom Lennon of Comedy Central's \"Reno 911!\". The series, entitled \"The Man,\" featured Ben and Tom posing as \"The Man\" to encourage young people NOT to vote. The sarcastic series has a following on MySpace TV, YouTube, and Break.\n\nTo encourage voter registration among youth for the 2008 presidential election, Declare Yourself hired photographers Mark Liddell and David LaChapelle to shoot a bondage-themed print advertising campaign. The ads include models, including celebrities Christina Aguilera, Jonathan Bennett, La Toya London and André 3000, in various forms of bondage as a symbol of reducing one's voice by failing to register as a voter. The photos include the tag, \"Only you can silence yourself.\" The ads drew national media attention, particularly those of actress Jessica Alba, who wears no visible clothing and is bound with black tape over her mouth and chest. Alba said of the advertisement, \"It didn't freak me out at all. What I like about Marc's work is that he tells a story and brings real emotion to his pictures.\"\n\nIn March 2011, Declare Yourself combined with the Student Association for Voter Empowerment to become Our Time, a 501(c)(3) membership organization pushing for greater representation of all Americans under 30. Matthew Segal is co-founder and president of OUR TIME.\n\n"}

{"id": "2181408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181408", "title": "Alabama State Capitol", "text": "Alabama State Capitol\n\nThe Alabama State Capitol, listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the First Confederate Capitol, is the state capitol building for Alabama located on Capitol Hill, originally Goat Hill, in Montgomery that was declared a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960.\n\nAlabama has had five political capitals during its history. The first was the territorial capital in St. Stephens in 1817, followed by the state convention in Huntsville in 1819, then the first \"permanent\" capital in Cahaba in 1820. It was then moved to Tuscaloosa in 1826 to a new three-story building, until coming to rest in Montgomery in 1846. The 1826 State House later became home to Alabama Central Female College, burned in 1923 and now ruins within Capitol Park. The current structure is the state's fourth purpose-built capitol building, with the first at Cahaba, the second at Tuscaloosa, and the last two in Montgomery. The first capitol building in Montgomery, located where the current building stands, burned after only two years. The current building was completed in 1851, although additional wings were added over the course of the following 140 years.\n\nThe current capitol building temporarily served as the Confederate Capitol while Montgomery served as the first political capital of the Confederate States of America in 1861, before being moved to Richmond, Virginia. Meeting in the Senate Chamber, the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States was drawn up by the Montgomery Convention on February 4, 1861. The convention also adopted the Permanent Constitution here on March 11, 1861. Over one hundred years later the third Selma to Montgomery march ended at the front marble staircase of the Capitol, with the marches and events surrounding them directly leading to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nArchitecturally, the building is Greek Revival in style with some Beaux-Arts influences. The central core of the building, as well as the east wing to the rear of the structure, is three stories over a below-grade basement. The north and south wings are two-stories over a raised basement. The front facade that is seen today is approximately wide and tall from ground level to the top of the lantern on the dome.\n\nThe first capitol building to be built in Montgomery was designed by Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia. Andrew Dexter, one of Montgomery's founders, kept a prime piece of property empty in anticipation of the capital eventually being moved to Montgomery from Tuscaloosa. This property, atop what was then known as Goat Hill due to its use as a pasture, was chosen as the site for the new capitol building. Construction began in 1846, with the new building presented to the state on December 6, 1847. Button credited much of his architectural inspiration to Minard Lafever's \"Beauties of Modern Architecture\".\n\nButton's building was stuccoed brick, with two full stories set over a rusticated raised basement. A two-story monumental portico with six Composite columns, topped by a broad pediment, was centered on the middle five bays of the front elevation. A central dome, in diameter, sat directly on a supporting ring at the main roof level behind the portico. The dome was crowned with an elaborate lantern patterned after the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. This first capitol building burned on December 14, 1849, little more than two years after its completion. The ruins were cleared by March 1850, with a new building soon to follow.\n\nThe current capitol building was built from 1850 to 1851, with Barachias Holt as supervising architect. Holt, originally from Exeter, Maine, was a master mechanic by trade. Following his work on the capitol he created a successful sash, door, and blind factory in Montgomery.\n\nThe new building utilized the brick foundations and general layout of Button's previous structure, with modifications by Holt. The modifications included a full three-story building over a basement and a three-story front portico, this time without a pediment. Holt's dome was a departure from the previous work also, this time the wood and cast iron dome was supported on a ring of Corinthian columns and topped with a simple twelve-sided glazed lantern. John P. and James D. Randolph were the principal contractors. had previously completed extensive brickwork on the William Nichols-designed campus for the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. Randolph was in charge of the carpentry work, which was at least partially accomplished by subcontractors. Nimrod E. Benson and Judson Wyman were the building supervisors.\n\nThe new capitol building was first occupied by the Alabama Legislature on October 1, 1851. The clock over the portico was installed in February 1852. The clock, along with a bell, was purchased by the City of Montgomery and presented to the state in 1852. In proportion to the capitol building, the clock appears as a square white box with black dials and crowned with a gabled roof. The dials are in diameter with minute hands and a hour hands. It has been criticized as architecturally inappropriate on various occasions since its initial installation. With the secession of Alabama and six other Deep South states and subsequent formation of the Confederacy in February 1861, the building served as its first capitol until May 22, 1861. A commemorative brass marker in the shape of a six-pointed star is set into the marble floor of the front portico at the precise location where Jefferson Davis stood on February 18, 1861, to take his oath of office as the only President of the Confederate States of America.\nIn 1961 Governor John Patterson flew a seven-starred version of the Stars and Bars over the capitol for several days in celebration of the centennial of the Civil War. His successor, George Wallace, raised the Confederate Battle Flag over the dome on April 25, 1963, the date of his meeting with U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to discuss desegregation at the University of Alabama, as a symbol of defiance to the federal government. The flag remained there for almost 30 years. Several African American legislators and members of the state chapter of the NAACP were arrested in 1988 after attempting to remove the flag. The flag was removed during renovations to the dome in 1991, and its return was barred by a 1993 state court decision, which ruled that a state statute from 1895 allows only the national and state flags to fly over the capitol building.\n\nThe building served as home to the Alabama Legislature until 1985, when it moved to the Alabama State House. Officially, this move was temporary, since the Alabama Constitution requires that the Legislature meet in the capitol. In 1984, a constitutional amendment was passed that allowed the Legislature to move to another building if the capitol were to be renovated. The renovation started in 1985 and was completed in 1992 by the architecture group Holmes and Holmes. Upon the reopening of the building, the Governor of Alabama and numerous other state offices moved back into the building, but the legislature remained at the State House.\n\nOn May 7, 2009, the legislature reconvened in the capitol building for the first time since September 20, 1985, due to flooding in the State House. This required some adapting, as the capitol did not have desks in the House chamber and those in the Senate chamber were 1861 replicas. Neither chamber has a computerized voting system. The capitol building's heating and air conditioning is supplied from the State House. Because the electricity had been turned off in the State House due to the flooding, there was no air conditioning in the capitol..\n\nThe original core of the building, as well as the subsequent additions, is essentially Greek Revival in style. The 1851 three-story core of the building features bays delineated by Doric pilasters and a monumental three-story hexastyle portico utilizing the Composite order. The original core of the building is , with an original central rear judiciary wing measuring . The first extension to the rear added another . Each side-wing is .\n\nThe additions started with an extension to the east wing on the building's rear facade in 1885. Then a south wing with Beaux-Arts influences was added in 1906. An externally identical north wing was completed in 1912. The matching side-wings were designed by Montgomery architect Frank Lockwood, in consultation with Charles Follen McKim of McKim, Mead & White. The symmetrical north and south side-wings are each joined to the 1851 structure with a hyphen. Each hyphen features a recessed two-story Ionic portico on the west facade. Both of the adjoining side-wings feature two-story hexastyle Ionic entrance porticoes on their north and south elevations, respectively. The west and east facades of these wings also feature decorative two-story hexastyle pseudo-porticoes with engaged Ionic columns. A new east wing addition with a new three-story tetrastyle portico was built during the 1985–92 restoration. The new portico includes columns that match the Composite order originals of the main entrance portico on the 1851 west elevation.\n\nUpon entering the ground floor of the capitol building, one enters the main stair-hall. It is the location of cantilevered stairways that spiral up to the third floor. The twin cantilevered spiral staircases are among the building's finest original architectural features. They were designed and built by architect Horace King, a former slave who was freed in 1846. Due to his renown in Alabama and surrounding states as a bridge builder, the Alabama Legislature passed a special law that exempted him from the state's manumission laws, which normally required that freed slaves leave the state within one year of gaining their freedom. During the post-war Reconstruction Era he served two terms in the Alabama House of Representatives, in the building that he had helped to design and build.\n\nImmediately east of the stair-hall is the ground floor of the rotunda. The ground floor of the rotunda, not physically open to the upper rotunda floors, contains the memorial sculpture \"Lurleen Burns Wallace\" (1968) by F. R. Schoenfeld. Wallace was Alabama's first female governor and died while in office in 1968. From there, hallways leading to offices branch off into the north and south wings. The next major room on the ground floor is the old Supreme Court Chamber, part of the original capitol plan. Located in the east (rear) wing, it is the only portion of the wing dating back to 1851. It is a large rectangular room, one story high, with a concave entry wall and two robust Ionic columns visually dividing the space near the center of the room. Later east wing expansions continue on eastward from this room.\n\nThe second floor is accessed via the main stairhall. From there the open rotunda is accessed to the east. The rotunda leads to the east wing offices, the old Senate Chamber to the north and the old House of Representatives Chamber to the south.\nThe interior of the capitol building is centered on the axial rotunda, which is topped by a large dome. The rotunda is open from the second floor and through the third floor to the top of the dome. The dome interior is decorated with eight painted murals by Roderick MacKenzie, a Scottish-born artist who relocated to Alabama. The murals illustrate MacKenzie's artistic interpretation of the history of Alabama. They were executed on canvas from 1926 to 1930 at his Mobile studio and then shipped to Montgomery by railroad for installation in July 1930.\n\nThe murals depict the hostile meeting of Hernando de Soto and Tuskaloosa in 1540, the establishment of the colonial French capital of Mobile by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville from 1702 to 1711, the surrender of William Weatherford to Andrew Jackson in 1814, pioneers settling the Alabama wilderness in 1816, the drafting of the Constitution of Alabama in 1818, wealth and leisure during the antebellum era from 1840 to 1860, the inauguration of Confederate President Jefferson Davis on the capitol steps in 1861, and, finally, prosperity following the development of resources from 1874 to 1930.\nBoth legislative chambers date to the original 1851 construction. Both of them are rectangular in shape and extend upward through the third floor, with a mezzanine gallery on that level. The galleries in both chambers are supported by Corinthian columns. Those in the old Senate Chamber are gilded, while those in the old House of Representatives Chamber are simply painted. The old Senate Chamber is the smaller of the two legislative chambers, with a mezzanine in a circular pattern stretching around all four sides of the room, broken only above lectern platform. The old House Chamber is larger, with a curvilinear mezzanine on three walls that merges into each side wall before reaching the lectern platform wall.\n\nThe Old Senate Chamber was the site of several events leading to the Civil War. The Alabama Secession Convention met here on January 11, 1861, and voted to withdraw from the Union. Then, the Confederate States of America was organized here via a provisional constitution on February 4, 1861, Jefferson Davis was elected as its first president on February 9, 1861, and finally the permanent Confederate constitution brought into effect on March 11, 1861.\n\nThe landscape plan for Capitol Hill surrounding the capitol building was originally designed by the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted in 1889. The grounds of Capitol Hill were surrounded by a cast iron fence from the 19th century into the first decades of the 20th. It was later removed and reused to enclose the Old Augusta Cemetery on Wares Ferry Road. The grounds still contain many trees and scrubs from the Olmsted design, in addition to numerous monuments. Other major features of the grounds include the marble steps leading to the front portico, the Confederate Memorial Monument and the Avenue of Flags. Statuary on the capitol grounds includes \"Albert Patterson\" (1961), \"Duty Called\" (1986) by Branko Medenica, \"James Marion Sims\" (1939) by Biancio Melarango, \"Jefferson Davis\" (1940) by Frederick Cleveland Hibbard, \"John Allan Wyeth\" (1920s) by Gutzon Borglum, and \"Joseph Lister Hill\" (1969) by Gualberto Rocchi.\n\nThe principal access to the capitol building was originally via a long flight of steps leading to the front portico. These were much narrower than those in place today. They were replaced by new steps fabricated from Alabama marble in 1942. The modern steps are the same width as the portico and are edged with raised marble planters.\n\nIt was here that the third Selma to Montgomery march ended on March 25, 1965, with 25,000 protesters at the foot of the capitol steps on Dexter Avenue. Prominent protesters included Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Coretta Scott King, Ralph Bunche, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, John Lewis, James Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, and Joan Baez. A delegation from the protestors attempted to see Governor George Wallace to give him a petition that asked for an end to racial discrimination in Alabama. The governor had sent word that he would see the delegation, but they were denied entry to the capitol grounds twice and told no one would be let through. State police surrounded the capitol and prevented the marcher's delegation entry to the grounds. Martin Luther King, Jr. then gave an impassioned speech at the base of the steps:\nThe delegation was later let through into the capitol, but were told that Wallace's office was closed for the day. The delegation later left, without having been able to give their petition to anyone. It read: \n\nThese steps remain as they were in 1965, although repairs were made during the 1992 renovation of the building. The steps have continued to be the rallying point for civil demonstrations over the succeeding years. Memorial Selma to Montgomery marches have ended at the steps on several occasions. The most recent, in honor of what would have been King's 83rd birthday, was held on January 15, 2012. On this occasion the marchers were greeted by Governor Robert J. Bentley.\n\nThe steps have seen protests by LGBT groups and immigration groups in recent years as well. The annual Vigil for Victims of Hate and Violence, sponsored by Equality Alabama, took place on the capitol steps on February 20, 2011, to heighten awareness of the lack of hate crime legislation to protect LGBT people in the state. Hundreds of protesters converged at the steps on December 17, 2011, to protest the passage of Alabama's strict new immigration law, Alabama HB 56.\n\nThe Avenue of Flags is another major feature of the Alabama State Capitol grounds. It is a grouping of the flags of the U.S. states, with a native stone from each state, engraved with its name, set at the base of each flagpole. The flagpoles are arranged in a semi-circle between the Ionic portico of the capitol building's south wing and Washington Avenue. It was completed during the term of Governor Albert Brewer, being officially dedicated on April 6, 1968.\n\nThe areas that are open for tourists are the entry stairhall, the old Governor's Office, the old State Supreme Court, the old Supreme Court Library, the rotunda, the old House of Representatives, and the old Senate Chamber. Its buildings and grounds are maintained by the Alabama Historical Commission.\n\n\n"}

She won for the latter of which at the 52nd Tony Awards.\n\nManahan was also nominated for two Drama Desk Awards, a Laurence Olivier Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award in her career spanned more than 60 years. She interpreted the works of, among others, Seán O'Casey, John B. Keane, John Millington Synge, Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, Martin McDonagh, Christy Brown, and Brian Friel.\n\nManahan was born in County Waterford in what was then the Irish Free State (now the Republic of Ireland). Her career began when, as a young woman, she was recruited by the legendary Irish impresarios and theatrical directors Micheál MacLiammóir and Hilton Edwards. She later married stage director Colm O'Kelly, who died not long afterwards of polio, which he contracted after swimming in the Nile during a theatre tour of Egypt. They had no children and she never remarried. She was known professionally by her maiden name.\nIn 1946 she appeared in a production by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy \"The Wild Goose\" where she played the part of Eileen Connolly, this was performed by Equity Productions in the Theatre Royal, Waterford.\n\nIn 1957, she played Serafina in the first Irish production of Tennessee Williams' \"The Rose Tattoo\" and achieved unexpected notoriety when she and several other members of the cast were arrested for the possession of a condom on stage.\n\nManahan played a minor role in the Irish cult soap opera \"The Riordans\" (1960s), and as Mrs. Kenefick in the TV comedy \"Me Mammy\" (1970s). She also played the lead in the Irish comedy series, \"Leave It To Mrs O'Brien\" (1980s) and Mrs. Cadogan in \"The Irish R.M.\" (1980s). Most recently she played Ursula in \"Fair City\", for which her niece, Michele Manahan (daughter of Michael Manahan), is a writer.\n\nShe had an extensive theatre portfolio having played at theatres throughout Ireland including the Abbey Theatre, the UK, continental Europe, the USA and Australia. She won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her role as Mag in Martin McDonagh's \"The Beauty Queen of Leenane\" on Broadway. She previously received a Tony nomination in 1969 for Brian Friel's \"Lovers\".\n\nThe late Irish playwright John B. Keane wrote the play \"Big Maggie\" specifically for her. In 2001 she starred in Keane's \"The Matchmaker\" with veteran Irish actor Des Keogh. In 2005 she starred in \"Sisters\", a new play by Declan Hassett that was also written for her and for which she was nominated for a Drama Desk Award in the category of Outstanding Solo Performance. The production toured Ireland and was staged at the International Festival of World Theatre in Colorado and also played at the 59e59 Theater in New York City in 2006.\n\nShe appeared in films starring, among others, Laurence Olivier, Peter Cushing, Kenneth More, Christopher Walken, Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and Brenda Fricker, and with John Gielgud in \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (1977).\n\nShe received the Gold Medal of the Éire Society of Boston in 1984 and thus joined the company of past recipients such as John F. Kennedy, and film makers John Ford and John Huston. She received an honorary doctorate in letters from the University of Limerick in 2003. She was granted the freedom of the city of Waterford in 2002 in recognition of her life's achievement in the arts. She thus became the 28th Freeman of Waterford since Isaac Butt in 1877.\n\nIn 2004 she started to play the role of Ursula in \"Fair City\". \"All About Anna\" (2005) a documentary on her life and work was made by Charlie Mc Carthy/Icebox Films for RTÉ television.

{"id": "2181434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181434", "title": "Ping of death", "text": "Ping of death\n\nA ping of death is a type of attack on a computer system that involves sending a malformed or otherwise malicious ping to a computer. \n\nA correctly-formed ping packet is typically 56 bytes in size, or 64 bytes when the ICMP header is considered, and 84 including Internet Protocol version 4 header. However, any IPv4 packet (including pings) may be as large as 65,535 bytes. Some computer systems were never designed to properly handle a ping packet larger than the maximum packet size because it violates the Internet Protocol documented in RFC 791. Like other large but well-formed packets, a ping of death is fragmented into groups of 8 octets before transmission. However, when the target computer reassembles the malformed packet, a buffer overflow can occur, causing a system crash and potentially allowing the injection of malicious code.\n\nIn early implementations of TCP/IP, this bug is easy to exploit and can affect a wide variety of systems including Unix, Linux, Mac, Windows, and peripheral devices. As systems began filtering out pings of death through firewalls and other detection methods, a different kind of ping attack known as ping flooding later appeared, which floods the victim with so many ping requests that normal traffic fails to reach the system (a basic denial-of-service attack).\n\nAs defined in RFC 791, the maximum packet length of an IPv4 packet including the IP header is 65,535 (2 − 1) bytes, a limitation presented by the use of a 16-bit wide IP header field that describes the total packet length.\n\nThe underlying Data Link Layer almost always poses limits to the maximum frame size (See MTU). In Ethernet, this is typically 1500 bytes. In such a case, a large IP packet is split across multiple IP packets (also known as IP fragments), so that each IP fragment will match the imposed limit. The receiver of the IP fragments will reassemble them into the complete IP packet and continue processing it as usual.\n\nWhen fragmentation is performed, each IP fragment needs to carry information about which part of the original IP packet it contains. This information is kept in the Fragment Offset field, in the IP header. The field is 13 bits long, and contains the offset of the data in the current IP fragment, in the original IP packet. The offset is given in units of 8 bytes. This allows a maximum offset of 65,528 ((2-1)*8). Then when adding 20 bytes of IP header, the maximum will be 65,548 bytes, which exceeds the maximum frame size. This means that an IP fragment with the maximum offset should have data no larger than 7 bytes, or else it would exceed the limit of the maximum packet length. A malicious user can send an IP fragment with the maximum offset and with much more data than 8 bytes (as large as the physical layer allows it to be).\n\nWhen the receiver assembles all IP fragments, it will end up with an IP packet which is larger than 65,535 bytes. This may possibly overflow memory buffers which the receiver allocated for the packet, and can cause various problems.\n\nAs is evident from the description above, the problem has nothing to do with ICMP, which is used only as payload, big enough to exploit the problem. It is a problem in the reassembly process of IP fragments, which may contain any type of protocol (TCP, UDP, IGMP, etc.).\n\nThe correction of the problem is to add checks in the reassembly process. The check for each incoming IP fragment makes sure that the sum of \"Fragment Offset\" and \"Total length\" fields in the IP header of each IP fragment is smaller or equal to 65,535. If the sum is greater, then the packet is invalid, and the IP fragment is ignored.\nThis check is performed by some firewalls, to protect hosts that do not have the bug fixed.\nAnother fix for the problem is using a memory buffer larger than 65,535 bytes for the re-assembly of the packet. (This is essentially a breaking of the specification, since it adds support for packets larger than those allowed.)\n\nIn 2013, an IPv6 version of the ping of death vulnerability was discovered in Microsoft Windows. Windows TCP/IP stack didn't handle memory allocation correctly when processing incoming malformed ICMPv6 packets, which could cause remote denial of service. This vulnerability was fixed in MS13-065 in August 2013. The CVE-ID for this vulnerability is .\n\n\n"}

The band was founded by three students of Warsaw's vocational high school (technikum) - Robert \"Robal\" Matera (guitar), Krzysztof Grabowski (drums), and Dariusz \"Stepa\" Stepnowski (bass). All three were born in 1963, and went to the same class. From the beginning Grabowski wrote lyrics, and Matera music. The three classmates originally planned to name their band Sektor A, but after some time changed their minds and named it SS-20. Soon afterwards, they were joined by another student of the same school, Dariusz \"Skandal\" Hajn (voc., born 1965), who, as Grabowski later stated, \"looked like a real punkrocker\". The band started regular rehearsals in the summer of 1981. With fast guitar riffs and intelligent lyrics written by Grabowski, Dezerter's concerts drew thousands of fans and its LPs were very popular, especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe most famous Dezerter's live appearance took place during the 1984 Jarocin Festival in Jarocin, Poland and it was attended by some 20,000 people. The concert was recorded and later parts of it were released (together with four songs from the 7″ EP recorded in 1983) on the LP \"Underground Out of Poland\". The LP was produced by Joey Shithead, vocalist of a Canadian band D.O.A.. Dezerter however is not widely known in other countries, perhaps because the band refrains from singing in the English language. Nevertheless, it played in several European countries, as well as Japan and the U.S. (in New York City and Chicago, early November 2009, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall). In 2010, Grabowski's memoirs \"Dezerter, poroniona generacja?\" (\"Dezerter, aborted generation?\") were published in Warsaw.\n\nSS-20 debuted during the \"Mokotów Autumn Music Festival\", in November 1981. In the spring of 1982 the band played at the \"Rail Worker House of Culture\" in Warsaw's district of Praga, but the show was ended halfway when management of the house disconnected electricity. Soon afterwards, SS-20 went for its first concert outside of Warsaw. It took place in Toruń, at the \"Od Nowa Club\". In early summer 1982, SS-20 recorded a tape and sent it to the management of the Jarocin Festival. To the surprise of band's members, it was qualified to perform. The August 1982 Jarocin show was filmed by Polish TV (see YouTube video of Dezerter at Jarocin 1982:), and by film director Paweł Karpiński. SS-20 became famous, and the band appeared in such films, as \"Być człowiekiem\", \"Film o pankach\", and \"To tylko rock\" (see YouTube video of Dezerter from the 1983 \"Film o pankach\" ).\n\nIn September 1982, the band had to change the name to Dezerter because of the reaction of the Communist authorities (SS-20 was a NATO reporting name of a Soviet ballistic missile, and this name was regarded too provocative by the government). To become less recognizable by the regime, they often changed the name in posters, sometimes spelled as \"De-zerter\", sometimes as \"The Zerter\" - it was a cheap and efficient trick to cheat the regime. At first, the band practiced at a Culture House in Nieporęt, moving in the late summer of 1983 to the \"Dziekanka Student Club\" in Warsaw. First show under the name Dezerter took place on September 15, 1982 at Warsaw's \"Riviera Remont Student Club\". In mid-November 1982, already under the name Dezerter, and together with other Polish punk rock bands (TZN Xenna and Deuter), it went on a tour across southeastern corner of the country. The tour was named \"Rock Galicja\", and featured shows in Rzeszów, Krosno, Sanok, and Mielec. After coming back to Warsaw, band's members had problems at their high school, since they missed several school days.\nIn the summer of 1983, with help of Polish Radio reporter Marek Wiernik, Dezerter recorded a four-song 7″ EP, \"Ku przyszłości\" (\"Into the future\") also known as \"Spytaj milicjanta\" (\"Ask a militiaman\"). Before recording, which took place at the state company Tonpress in Warsaw's district of Wawrzyszew, the band provided a list of 12 songs, and Communist censorship office allowed four of them - \"Spytaj milicjanta\", \"Ku przyszłości\", \"Szara rzeczywistość\" (\"Drab reality\"), and \"Wojna głupców\" (\"War of fools\"). The record was issued by Tonpress, and was very warmly welcomed by fans, with 50,000 copies sold. Members of the band distributed it to several fanzines and activists in the West, including Maximumrocknroll, in which a positive reviev was published. As a result, Dezerter became a recognized punk rock band.\n\nIn the first half of 1984 the band moved to \"University of Warsaw Student Club Hybrydy\", where it prepared for the Jarocin Festival. The 1984 festival took place in early August, and Dezerter's show, recorded and later published as \"Jeszcze żywy człowiek\" (\"Still living man\"), turned out to be one of the main events of the festival. The band prepared all their best songs, and during the frequent breaks, Skandal and Stepa would read excerpts from popular Polish comic books, such as Hans Kloss. Furthermore, at one point the band requested firefighters, who were present at the stadium with their trucks, to water the dry grass, as there were clouds of dust in the air, caused by the pogo. The organizers refused to do so, and the show was interrupted several times, as the situation almost got out of control, with the threat of a riot. After the show, the band argued with the organizer of the festival, Walter Chełstowski, and as a result, Dezerter was not allowed to perform at the Jarocin Festival until 1987.\n\nIn the fall of 1984, after a concert at Warsaw's \"Hybrydy\", the band met a man named Maciej Chmiel, who became Dezerter's manager. Soon afterwards, band's members, for the money received as royalties from Tonpress for its EP, purchased a tape recorder at a Pewex store, opening its own illegal publishing company, \"Tank Records\". First release was Dezerter's Jarocin 1984 show, issued as \"Jeszcze żywy człowiek\" (\"Still living man\"), which years later came out as a CD. In early 1985 Dezerter attempted to perform in Jugoslavia, but Communist government of Poland refused to grant passports to the members of the band. In December 1985, Canadian punk rock band D.O.A. performed at Warsaw's \"Riviera Remont\". After the show, the Canadians met with Dezerter, and Joey Shithead offered to take band's recordings to North America, to try to publish them. The Underground Out of Poland, based on material handed over to Shithead, was released in 1987 by Maximumrocknroll. Originally, as Grabowski claims, the album was planned to be released by Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles, but it didn't happen due to Biafra's legal problems with the poster in the record sleeve of his Frankenchrist album. According to Grabowski, Dezerter sent its own cover design for the \"Underground Out of Poland\" album, but Maximumrockandroll chose their design. Furthermore, the Americans changed the name of the album, as Grabowski wanted to name it \"Greatest sHits\".\n\nIn the fall of 1985 Dezerter's bassist Dariusz \"Stepa\" Stepnowski was drafted into the People's Army of Poland, and the last show with band's original lineup took place at Warsaw's \"Róbrege Festival\" in late summer 1985. Soon afterwards, Stepnowski was replaced by Paweł Piotrowski. With Stepa's disappearance, the \"Tank Records\" was closed. Last tape published by the company was \"Izolacja\" (\"Isolation\"), Dezerter Live 1985 at the Hybrydy. It came out in early 1986, and at the same time, Dezerter's charismatic lead singer, Dariusz \"Skandal\" Hajn began to skip practices, due to his budding Polish heroin addiction. Finally, in mid-1986 Skandal did not go to a show at Szczecin, without explaining the reason for it. From then on, Dezerter turned into a trio, with Robal both playing the guitar and singing. Before that happened, Dezerter's songs appeared on two compilation albums, \"Fala\" (\"Wave\") (1985), and \"Jak punk to punk\" (\"If it is punk, then it is punk\") (1986).\n\nIn late 1986, Dezerter suspended its concert activities, due to several reasons, one of which was the emergence of skinheads. Furthermore, the band had to travel to its concerts by train, which was dangerous and time-consuming, especially at locations far away from Warsaw. At that time, Dezerter again turned into a four-member band, with Rafał Kwaśniewski as second guitarist. Kwaśniewski, however, did not play with the band for long, quitting in late 1987. On June 1, 1987, Dezerter began recording its first Longplay, at a studio located in Warsaw's district of Wawrzyszew. Even though Skandal and Stepa were no longer with the band, both were invited to record a song. The circulation of the LP was originally limited to only 5,000 copies. The band wanted to name it \"Kolaboracja\" (\"Collaboration\"), but the censorship office did not give permission for it. The album was finally issued in the spring of 1988, under the name \"Dezerter\" (in the subsequent issues, the name \"Kolaboracja\" was used). In August 1987, Dezerter performed at the Jarocin Festival, due to the fact that festival's manager Walter Chełstowski had been replaced by Marcin Jacobson. Soon after Jarocin, the \"Róbrege Festival\" was organized in Warsaw (late summer 1987). Dezerter prepared a special show, inviting artists from the \"Totart Group\" from Gdańsk.\n\nOn December 10, 1987 Dezerter for the first time in its history left Poland, and went by ferry to Finland, on invitation of Anarchist Collective \"Vox Populi\" from Helsinki. A few months later, in the spring of 1988, the band went to Kiev, which at that time belonged to the Soviet Union. The concert, which took place at an amphitheater in Kiev, was cancelled after a few songs, because, as the organizers explained, \"it already was 10 p.m.\". In May 1988, the band went to a Polish Radio studio in Opole, where it recorded its second Polish album, \"Kolaboracja II\". Once again, the censorship changed the title of the LP to \"Dezerter\". In December 1988, Dezerter, which due to the \"Underground Out of Poland\" album already was a band well-recognized in the West, went by train on a tour of West Germany, and in May 1989, again to West Germany, as well as France and Switzerland. Finally, after a 16-month break, Dezerter once again performed in Poland (December 14, 1989 at Warsaw's \"Hybrydy Student Club\").\n\nIn mid-1989, Dezerter began working on material for a new album. In January 1990, at a studio in Wawrzyszew, recording of the LP \"Wszyscy przeciwko wszystkim\" (\"Everyone Against Everything\") started. Most of the songs were new, except for \"Pałac\" (\"Palace\") and \"Jutro\" (\"Tomorrow\"), which had been written in the mid-1980s, but were not allowed to be officially published. Furthermore, the LP included a song \"Panie Ty nasz\" (\"Our Lord\"), which is a cover of De Press (with the permission of Andrzej Dziubek, in exchange for a glass of wine, as Dziubek wrote on February 8, 1990). After recording, in April 1990, Dezerter went on a two-month tour of Switzerland, France, Germany and Holland (30 concerts, mostly at clubs and squats). Among bands that played with the Poles were Carcass (at Amsterdam's Melkweg), The Ex, Dog Faced Hermans, and Citizen Fish (in Paris; after the show both bands played a football game).\n\nA few days after returning to Poland (June 1990), Dezerter went to Frankfurt Airport, from where it flew to Tokyo, on invitation of Michiro Endo of The Stalin, a renowned Japanese punk rock band. Together with The Stalin, Polish rockers performed at Kawasaki (two shows), Nagoya, and Osaka. Both Kawasaki shows were recorded and five songs were later included in the CD \"Wszyscy przeciwko wszystkim\", published in 1991. In exchange, Dezerter's manager Maciej Chmiel invited The Stalin for the 1990 Jarocin Festival, which took place in August of that year. Chmiel himself resigned from his post of band's manager in late 1990. In February 1991 Dezerter went on a concert to Gryfino. On the way back, a car accident took place on icy road near Łomża, after which both Matera and Grabowski ended up in hospital, with broken clavicles. As a result, the band ceased to perform for a few months.\n\nIn late 1991 the band began working on a new album, \"Blasfemia\" (\"Blasphemy\"), which was recorded in 1992 at the Izabelin Studio. Together with the LP, Dezerter's first ever videoclip was made, for the \"Pierwszy raz\" (\"First time\") song (see the clip at YouTube ). With new manager, Piotr \"Pietia\" Wierzbicki\", Dezerter frequently performed across Poland in the first half of the 1990s. In spring 1992, the band once again left for Western Europe, performing in Hamburg and Scandinavia, together with Disorder. One show took place at the Blitz in Oslo, together with Jingo de Lunch.\n\nIn 1993, together with Kasia Nosowska, Dezerter recorded new versions of its old songs \"Ku Przyszłości\", \"Yugoslavia\", \"Dla zysku\" (\"For profit\") and \"Niewolnik\" (\"Slave\"). Together with other old songs, and the 1980s live recordings, they were published in the CD \"Jak powstrzymałem III wojnę światową, czyli nieznana historia Dezertera\" (\"How I Stopped World War Three, or Unknown History of Dezerter\"). In August 1993, Dezerter performed at the \"Energia Sztuki\" Festival, which took place near the site of the Żarnowiec Nuclear Power Plant (see YouTube video of Dezerter at the festival ), and in the autumn of that year, the band went on a tour of England, which was cancelled after the musicians were not allowed entry into the United Kingdom, and returned from Dover back to the Continent. After that failure, Paweł Piotrowski left the band, which turned into a duet of Grabowski and Matera.\n\nIn the spring 1994 at the studio in Wawrzyszew, Grabowski and Matera recorded another album, \"Ile procent duszy?\" (\"What is the Percentage of the Soul?\"), with one song \"Facet\" (\"Guy\", based on Big Man, Big M.a.n. by Crass) sung by Matera together with Dominika Domczyk of Post Regiment. After the release of the album, Dezerter was joined by a new bassist, Tomasz \"Tony von Kinsky\" Lewandowski. In 1994, a film documentary \"Dezerter, nie ma zagrożenia\" (\"Dezerter, There is No Threat\") was released. It was directed by Paweł \"Konjo\" Konnak, and presents the history of the band, together with interviews with the musicians (see the film at YouTube ). Furthermore, two videoclips for the songs \"Ostatnia chwila\" (\"Last Moment\", see ) and \"Nie ma zagrożenia\" (see ) were made together with the film. On May 8, 1995, Dariusz \"Skandal\" Hajn, Dezerter's legendary singer died at the age of 30, and as Grabowski wrote in his book: \"We found out about it probably during a rehearsal, when someone told us (...) He had been hurting himself for years, and it happened. Apparently it was the liver or the heart problem. Until now we do not know exactly what happened. All we know is that he had been reaching for different poisons. His organism was unable to stand it any longer\". In the same year, at a studio in Sulejówek, Dezerter recorded another album, \"Deuter\". The band was joined by Paweł \"Kelner\" Rozwadowski, and the album is a tribute to Deuter, a Warsaw punk rock band, popular in Poland in the early 1980s, of which Rozwadowski was the lead singer. All songs featured on the album were based on early Deuter recordings, and in the late 1995/early 1996 Dezerter played some 30 shows across Poland.\n\nIn late August 1996, Dezerter again entered the studio at Sulejówek, to record yet another album, \"Mam kły mam pazury\" (\"I Have Fangs, I Have Claws\"; the title was taken from an animal rights fanzine published in Grudziądz). It was released by Warner Music Poland, which had purchased Dezerter's publisher, Polton. Next album, \"Ziemia jest płaska\" (\"The Earth is Flat\"), was recorded in December 1997 - January 1998, and released in early spring 1998. Contrary to previous albums, it did not sell well. Furthermore, the number of shows was reduced, which was connected with a crisis of Poland's independent music. As a result, members of the band had to find jobs to make both ends meet, with Lewandowski leaving Poland for England. For the next two years, Dezerter remained in limbo.\n\nIn November 2000 at Warsaw's \"Proxima\" Club, Dezerter for the first time performed with a new bassist, Jacek Chrzanowski, who also plays for Hey. Furthermore, Hey's manager Krzysztof Dominik became Dezerter's manager. In early 2001, the band took part in a \"Holiday in the Snow\" tour, together with Post Regiment and Apatia. On June 5, 2001, Dezerter's new record \"Decydujące starcie\" (\"Decisive Clash\") came out, published by Metal Mind Productions.\n\nIn April 2002, together with Kasia Nosowska, the band went on a tour of Holland, England, Belgium and Germany (altogether 6 shows). The three shows in England took place in London, Bradford and Birmingham, together with a French band \"La Fraction\". Furthermore, at London Astoria Dezerter performed with Conflict, and other bands. After coming back to Poland, Dezerter began working on a new album, \"Nielegalny zabójca czasu\" (\"Illegal Killer of Time\"), which was recorded at a studio in Piaseczno, and released in 2004, again by Metal Mind Productions. In the summer of that year, Dezerter performed at the Przystanek Woodstock. The show was recorded and released on DVD in 2005.\n\nIn August 2005, the Jarocin Festival was brought back, after a few years' break. Dezerter performed there, and again in 2007. In the spring of 2006, the band went on a tour of Germany (Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg). In 2006, due to the anniversary of Dezerter's 25th years of existence, a double album \"Punk's Not Jazz\" was released, with band's most popular songs. In the late 2000s, Dezerter's songs were presented in three Polish films, \"Dom zły\", \"Wszystko, co kocham\", and \"Beats of Freedom\". In June 2010, Mystic Production released band's another album, \"Prawo do bycia idiotą\" (\"The right to be an Idiot\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

They feuded with \"Mr. Olympia\" Jerry Stubbs, Austin Idol and Bob Armstrong, as well as Armstrong's sons, Brad, Scott and Steve.\n\nThe next version was created by Ron's brother Robert Fuller in 1986. Between 1986 and 1989 in the Continental Wrestling Association, members included Fuller, Golden, Dutch Mantel, Wendell Cooley, Detroit Demolition, Tom Prichard, The Flame, Cactus Jack, Brian Lee and Gary Young. They feuded with the Armstrong family, Cooley and The Nightmares in Continental, and with Jerry Lawler and Jeff Jarrett in Memphis.\n\nIn 1991, another version of The Stud Stable was formed in Smoky Mountain Wrestling that contained Robert Fuller, Jimmy Golden, and Dutch Mantel. The Stud Stable feuded with The Rock 'n' Roll Express and the Heavenly Bodies. They started out as pure heels, but became 'tweeners, feuding with both heels and babyfaces. The group disbanded when Robert Fuller went to WCW to become a manager in 1993.\n\nThe final version was created in World Championship Wrestling when Robert Fuller was known as \"Col.

{"id": "2181459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181459", "title": "Abstentionism", "text": "Abstentionism\n\nAbstentionism is standing for election to a deliberative assembly while refusing to take up any seats won or otherwise participate in the assembly's business. Abstentionism differs from an election boycott in that abstentionists participate in the election itself. Abstentionism has been used by Irish republican political movements in the United Kingdom and Ireland since the early 19th century. It was also used by Hungarian and Czech nationalists in the Austrian Imperial Council in the 1860s.\n\nWhen suppressing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Austrian Empire abolished the Diet of Hungary. Austria's 1861 February Patent reserved places for Hungary in the indirectly-elected Imperial Council, but the Hungarians did not send representatives, arguing the Council was usurping authority properly belonging to the Diet. Emulating the Hungarians, the Czech delegates for Bohemia withdrew in 1863, and those from Moravia in 1864. Hungarian demands were met by the Compromise of 1867, with the empire becoming the dual monarchy of Austria–Hungary in which the Hungarian half was ruled by a revived Diet. In 1904, Arthur Griffith published \"The Resurrection of Hungary\" arguing for a British–Irish dual monarchy similar to the 1867 compromise. Griffith's subsequent \"\"Sinn Féin\" policy\" developed this model. Tom Kettle of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) countered that Bohemia had remained in the Austrian half of the post-1867 empire, and its delegates abandoned abstentionism in 1879.\n\nAfter the Act of Union 1800, Ireland was represented in the British Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Repeal of the Act of Union was a goal of many Irish nationalists.\n\nIn 1845, a motion was carried at the Repeal Association's committee for all Irish members of parliament (MPs) to withdraw from Westminster. It was proposed by Thomas Osborne Davis of the Young Ireland movement. However, the committee felt that MPs already sitting could not withdraw without breaking the oath of office they had taken upon election. The Irish Confederation, which withdrew from the Repeal Association in 1847, resolved in favour of immediate abstention; however, its founder William Smith O'Brien continued to speak at Westminster. In 1848, Charles Gavan Duffy proposed that Irish MPs expelled from Westminster should sit in a separate Irish parliament.\n\nOther early abstentionist advocates included George Sigerson in 1862, and John Dillon in 1878, who envisaged abstentionist Irish MPs meeting in a separate Irish parliament.\n\nFrom the 1860s, Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) leaders Charles Kickham and John O'Leary favoured abstentionism. In 1869, G. H. Moore suggested nominating imprisoned republicans for election, knowing they were precluded as convicted felons from taking seats. On this basis, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa (in 1870) and John Mitchel (twice in 1875) were returned at by-elections in Tipperary; O'Donovan Rossa was in prison at his election, while Mitchel was in exile.\n\nKickham envisaged a \"great national conference\" calling on Irish MPs to withdraw from Westminster. A motion to that effect was proposed by Charles Guilfoyle Doran and passed at the convention of the Home Rule League (HRL). \"Honest\" John Martin, \"independent nationalist\" MP for Meath from 1871 to 1875, spoke in Westminster only to raise nationalist protests, and refused to vote. In the 1874 election, 59 HRL MPs were returned, including John O'Connor Power in Mayo, who was a member of the IRB Supreme Council. He was to fall out with the IRB over allegations of misappropriating election funds, and became progressively less radical. O'Connor Power believed that Westminster was the best platform to argue Ireland's case for self-government. Withdrawal from Parliament would be an abandonment of the Home Rule party to those who favoured conciliation rather than confrontation. By 1876 it was clear that the HRL would never be able to organise a national convention, and MPs elected with its endorsement would remain at Westminster. An alternative to abstentionism was obstructionism, including the use of filibuster. This was practised by the HRL and its successor, the IPP under Charles Stuart Parnell from the late 1870s.\n\nArthur Griffith's \"Sinn Féin Policy\", formulated between 1905 and 1907, called for Irish MPs to abstain from Westminster and sit in a parallel parliament in Dublin. The first Sinn Féin abstentionist candidate was Charles Dolan in 1908. Having sat as MP for North Leitrim for the IPP, he resigned after joining Sinn Féin, and lost the ensuing by-election. Laurence Ginnell's 1909 proposal that the United Ireland League (UIL) adopt abstentionism caused a near-riot; he left the UIL but continued to sit at Westminster until he joined Sinn Féin in 1917. Abstentionism was opposed by most nationalists, especially after the January 1910 general election when the IPP held the balance of power at Westminster and secured passage of the Third Home Rule Bill from the Liberal government. The nationalist mood changed after the 1916 Rising, and the IPP itself withdrew from Westminster in April 1918, to protest against the extension of conscription to Ireland. At the 1916 West Cork by-election, Sinn Féin initially endorsed All-for-Ireland League candidate Frank J. Healy, a supporter interned after the 1916 Rising, but withdrew support when Healy declared his intention to take his seat; the confusion contributed to Healy's defeat.\n\nThe first abstentionist MP elected was Count George Noble Plunkett after the North Roscommon by-election of 3 February 1917. Plunkett did not categorically state his abstentionism until after his victory. Plunkett's Liberty League, Griffith's monarchist Sinn Féin, and the northern Irish Nation League merged later that year into a reconstituted Sinn Féin, agreeing after contentious disputation that abstentionism was a principle rather than merely a tactic. Sinn Féin MPs elected to Westminster in November 1918 refused to take their seats there and instead constituted themselves in Dublin in January 1919 as the TDs () of the first \"Dáil\", which was claimed to be the legitimate parliament of the Irish Republic. The Irish Labour Party stood aside in 1918 in favour of Sinn Féin, having at first proposed to be abstentionist until emergency laws were lifted. Sinn Féin was unsure whether to boycott the 1921 elections to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland and House of Commons of Southern Ireland set up by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It decided to contest the Northern election for tactical reasons and the Southern one for consistency, with its returned MPs becoming the TDs of the Second Dáil.\n\nOne strand within Republicanism, in remaining loyal to this pre-Partition Irish Republic, denies the legitimacy of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Other parties reached accommodation with the southern state but not Northern Ireland. Some groups have boycotted elections within either jurisdiction; others have been abstentionist; others abstained from some bodies but not others. Abstentionism has often been a divisive issue within Republicanism.\n\nThe 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State, with an opt-out for Northern Ireland and requiring an Oath of Allegiance for Free State legislators. The Treaty split Sinn Féin, mainly over the Oath rather than \"Partition\", and caused the Irish Civil War. The June 1922 election featured a \"Sinn Féin panel\" of pro- and anti-Treaty candidates, but the resulting Third Dáil was boycotted by the anti-Treaty TDs. These refounded Sinn Féin in 1923 and based their continued abstention from the Free State Dáil on Partition. Fianna Fáil split from Sinn Féin in 1926 and abandoned abstentionism in the Free State in 1927. From 1955, Sinn Féin contested local elections in the Republic of Ireland and took its seats, arguing this did not amount to recognising the state.\n\nIn 1970, at its Ard Fheis (annual conference), Sinn Féin split again on the issue of whether or not to reverse its long-standing policy of refusing to take seats in Dáil Éireann. The split created two parties calling themselves \"Sinn Féin\". The anti-abstentionist party was known as \"Official\" Sinn Féin. It changed its name to \"Sinn Féin the Workers Party\" (SFWP) and won a seat in the Dáil in the general election of 1981, which it took. The following year it dropped \"Sinn Féin\" from its name to become \"The Workers' Party\". The abstentionist party was initially referred to as \"Provisional\" Sinn Féin, but after 1982 it was known simply as \"Sinn Féin\"; it continued to abstain from taking seats won in all institutions.\n\nSinn Féin split in 1986, as in 1970, over whether to take seats in Dáil Éireann. The larger group led by Gerry Adams abandoned abstentionism, while Republican Sinn Féin (RSF), led by Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, retained it. Sinn Féin's first sitting Teachta Dála was Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, elected in Cavan–Monaghan in 1997.\n\nRSF has retained the policy of abstentionism from both Dáil Éireann and the Northern Ireland Assembly. RSF has not in fact contested elections for Dáil Éireann or Westminster.\n\nAfter Partition, most non-abstentionist parties in the southern state did not organise at all in Northern Ireland. In early 1922, the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State was seen as representing the interests of nationalists in Northern Ireland and had a policy of not recognising the Northern Irish government. Catholic bishop Joseph MacRory (who later became Archbishop of Armagh and a Cardinal) indicated to the Provisional Government that Joe Devlin and his party members wanted to enter the new Parliament of Northern Ireland, and was worried that the policy of non-recognition would result in Northern Irish nationalists having to \"fight alone\", but his advice was ignored.\n\nAbstentionism at local elections was effectively prohibited by a 1934 law requiring candidates to take an oath to attend council sessions.\n\nThe Nationalist Party did not take their seats during the first Stormont parliament (1921–25). Despite forming the second-largest parliamentary party, they did not accept the role of Opposition for a further forty years. They did so on 2 February 1965 but withdrew from opposition again in October 1968, two weeks after police batoned demonstrators at a civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968.\n\nCahir Healy was elected to both the Stormont and Westminster parliaments under a variety of nationalist labels between the 1920s and the 1960s. He was abstentionist in Stormont until 1927 and at Westminster from 1950 to 1952. In the 1930s, Healy led the Irish Union Association, which supported his policy of intermittent tactical abstentionism, whereas the otherwise-similar Northern Council for Unity regarded abstentionism as a principle.\n\nFrom 1953, Stormont candidates were required to take the British oath of allegiance before standing, precluding Sinn Féin from doing so. This did not apply at Westminster elections, where Sinn Féin often gave non-Sinn Féin abstentionist nationalists a free run to avoid splitting the nationalist vote, but conversely fielded a spoiler candidate against non-abstentionist nationalists.\n\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) became the Opposition on its formation on 21 August 1970 but that party withdrew from Stormont in July 1971. The SDLP participated in the assembly set up for the Sunningdale Agreement, and in the Constitutional Convention. It originally intended to boycott the election to the 1982 Assembly, but adopted abstentionism to avoid giving a free run to Sinn Féin. Brian Feeney suggests that Sinn Féin's \"active abstention\", where those elected acted as local spokespeople in the media, was more effective than the SDLP's policy of sending its representatives instead to the New Ireland Forum in Dublin. The SDLP's participation in the 1996–98 Northern Ireland Forum was intermittent.\n\nSinn Féin adopted the \"armalite and ballot box strategy\" in 1981, and first contested modern elections in Northern Ireland with the 1982 Assembly elections, from which they abstained. The 1983 ardfheis resolved to take seats in the European Parliament, as the 1985 ardfheis did for that year's local elections. Sinn Féin abstained from the Northern Ireland Forum.\n\nSince the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, both the SDLP and Sinn Féin have taken their seats in that body. SDLP MPs have consistently taken their seats in Westminster, in contrast to Sinn Féin MPs, who refuse to take their seats there as they refuse to recognise the UK Parliament's right to legislate for any part of Ireland.\n\nFianna Fáil's sole Stormont election came in 1933, when its leader Éamon de Valera agreed to stand as an abstentionist for South Down, where he had been a Sinn Féin MP in the 1920s. Fianna Fáil registered as a political party within Northern Ireland in 2007. In 2014 its leader Mícheál Martin announced it would contest elections from 2019. It has not made clear whether it will contest elections to Westminster.\n\nRepublican Sinn Féin continue their long standing policy of abstentionism. It is not a registered party in Northern Ireland, but members have contested the Assembly elections as independents. When Saoradh, a dissident republican party, was established in 2016, it had not decided whether to contest elections, but said it would in any case abstain from taking up any seats won in Stormont, Westminster or Leinster House.\n\nAfter the June 2017 UK general election, which resulted in a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party with the DUP in potential balance of power, Gerry Adams reiterated Sinn Féin's long-standing position that their elected MPs would not swear allegiance to the Queen nor take their seats in Westminster.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181466", "title": "Open-book management", "text": "Open-book management\n\nOpen-book management (OBM) is a management phrase coined by John Case of Inc. magazine, who began using the term in 1993. The concept's most visible success has been achieved by Jack Stack and his team at SRC Holdings.\n\nThe basis of open-book management is that the information received by employees should not only help them do their jobs effectively, but help them understand how the company is doing as a whole. According to Case, \"a company performs best when its people see themselves as partners in the business rather than as hired hands\" (Case,1998 as cited in Pascarella, 1998). The technique is to give employees all relevant financial information about the company so they can make better decisions as workers. This information includes, but is not limited to, revenue, profit, cost of goods, cash flow and expenses.\n\nStack and Case conceptualize open-book principles in similar ways.\n\nStack uses three basic principles in his management practice called, \"The Great Game of Business\". \nHis basic rules for open-book management are: \n\nSimilarly, in 1995, Case made sense of open-book with three main points:\n\nIn a company fully employing open-book management employees at all levels are very knowledgeable about how their job fits into the financial plan for the company. However taking a company from \"normal\" to open is not as easy as just sharing financial statements with employees. Open-book management is considered to be a success when companies allow improvements on their financial numbers to come from the bottom tier of employee rather than pressure exerted by a traditional top-down management system. (Johnson, 1992 as cited in Aggarwal & Simkins, 2001). While employees need to be trained to understand income statements and balance sheets; open-book management aims to achieve a level of understanding of company finances between all employees to the degree that they are able to report predictions to upper management. In order to motivate employees to strive for change, open-book management focuses on a \"Critical Number\". The number is different for every company but it is a number that represents a prime indicator of profitability or break-even point. Discovering this Critical Number is a key component of creating an open-book company. Once this is discovered, a \"Scoreboard\" is developed that brings together all the numbers needed to calculate the critical number. The Scoreboard is open for all to see and meetings take place to discuss how individuals can influence the direction of the \"Score\" and therefore, ultimately, the performance against the Critical Number. Finally a Stake in the Outcome is provided which can be a bonus plan that is tied to Critical Number performance or it can include Equity sharing or both.\n\nThe Annual Gathering of Games is the only practitioner-led conference on creating a culture of ownership by teaching employees to think and act like owners . At the event, business leaders learn from people who have used open-book management to increase the size, profitability and employee engagement in their companies . The conference consists of sessions, keynote speakers and workshops that are specifically targeted to each phase of open-book management.\n\n"}

{"id": "2181481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181481", "title": "Johannes Wiedewelt", "text": "Johannes Wiedewelt\n\nJohannes Wiedewelt (1 July 1731 – 17 December 1802), Danish neoclassical sculptor. He became a court sculptor, introducing neoclassical ideals to Denmark in the form of palace decorations, garden sculptures and artifacts and, especially, memorial monuments. He was undoubtedly the best known Danish sculptor before Bertel Thorvaldsen.\n\nHe was born in Copenhagen to royal sculptor to the Danish Court, Just Wiedewelt (1677–1757) and his wife Birgitte Lauridsdatter. \nThe elder Wiedewelt recognised his son's talents early, and the boy trained under the Italian history painter Hieronimo Miani, one of the two leaders of the Drawing and Painting Academy (\"Tegne- og Malerakademiet\") in Copenhagen along with Louis August le Clerc (1688–1771), as early as perhaps 1744. This Academy was the precursor to the still-extant Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\") established ten years later. \nWhen Miani left Denmark in 1745 to return to Italy, the elder Wiedewelt took a stronger hand in training the boy, apprenticing him in his workshop. At the same time the young Wiedeweldt continued at the Academy, drawing under Johan Christof Petzoldt (1708-1762) and he presumedly also trained under royal sculptor to the Danish Court, Didrick Gercken (169-1748).\nHe began already to produce his own works early, and had produced in Spring 1750 two small busts cast in tin of King Frederik V and Queen Louise. He was paid a reasonable sum for this work, and it encouraged him to follow his dream to study outside of Denmark.\n\nSeveral months later at nineteen years of age he ventured out on a student travel that took him over Hamburg to Rouen and finally to Paris in August 1750. There he met the Danish Legation secretary to the French Court in Paris Joachim Wasserschlebe\n(1709-1787) who would become a patron of the young sculptor. With Wasserschlebe's help, Wiedewelt was taken into the studio of the renowned Baroque sculptor Guillaume Coustou the Younger, where from 1750-1754 he worked partially as a student and partially as an assistant. He later received a yearly royal allowance from King Frederik, which was doubled after two years. \n\nIn Paris he also came to know Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. During 1752-1754, Wiedewelt made a sculpture of fellow-Dane, Magnus Gustav Arbien (1716–1760), medallionist who was at the time studying under a royal stipend from the Danish Court. Wiedewelt won a silver medallion from the French Academy of Art (Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture) in 1753.\n\nThere was a sweeping artistic interest during those times for the study of ancient art. This rage originated in the discoveries of Herculaneum in 1738 and Pompeii in 1748, and was fanned by the directorship of the French Academy, Marquis de Marigny Abel-François Poisson(1727–1781), brother of royal mistressMadame de Pompadour (1721–1764). Poisson introduced the technique of drawing from antiquities, especially architecture, sculpture and landscapes, instead of from models. This technique was based on his experiences in Italy visiting the recently excavated archeological sites.\n\nWiedewelt was the first to receive a travel stipend from the newly established Danish Academy of Art in 1754 and used the funds to travel to Italy. Although Coustou tried to convince Wiedewelt to stay in Paris longer, the young sculptor left for Rome in May 1754. His trip took him over Lyon, Marseille and Civitavecchia; he arrived in Rome on 7 June 1754. \n\nA letter of recommendation from Wasserschlebe introduced Wiedewelt to the Director of the French Academy in Rome (\"l´Academie de France á Rome\"), Charles-Joseph Natoire (1700-1777). He lived and studied at the Academy, lodging at the Palazzo Mancini. Natoire put him in contact with others in residence there. Among these were German painter Anton Raphael Mengs, Italian Pompeo Batoni, and German archeologist and art theorist Johann Joachim Winckelmann who arrived in Rome 1755. At the Academy he, along with other students, came under the influence of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who had lived in Rome since 1740 and who set a heightened focus on antiquities as artistic subject matter.\n\nWiedewelt visited private collections such as the Farnese collection, as well as the publicly accessible ones such as the Capitoline Museums and the Vatican Museum. He and Johann Winckelmann studied ancient sculptures together, and Winckelmann advised the younger Wiedewelt, encouraging him to use these sculptures as a base for his drawings and to use his knowledge of ancient art as the basis for his artistic production. Wiedewelt made many drawings and sketches of these ancient sculptures during his Roman residence. The two were inseparable. Wiedewelt's friendship and admiration for Winckelmann left a deep impression on him, especially in regards his acquired knowledge and appreciation for Ancient Greek artifacts and art. During his time in Rome he also managed to take excursions to Naples, Pompeii, Herculaneum and Portici. Several of these trips were made in the company of Winckelmann in 1758. The two would remain close, maintaining a lively letter exchange, until Winckelmann was murdered in Trieste in 1768.\n\nWiedewelt left Rome on 1 July 1758, when his financial support was running out, and after he had been ordered home to Denmark by the Academy. He traveled back in the company of friend, neoclassical painter Johan Edvard Mandelberg. They traveled over Caprarola, Siena, Florence, Pisa, Carrara, Lucca, Bologna, Padua, Venice, and Trieste where they studied the local art collections and churches, and on through the Tyrol and Germany. They arrived back to Copenhagen on 6 October 1758.\n\nHardly six months after his return Wiedewelt was named member of the newly organised Art Academy, as well as being named royal sculptor to the Danish Court in 1759, inclusive gratis studio at Materialgaarden near Frederiksholm's Canal. He was known for his good taste in art and his knowledge of antiquities. He became quickly the judge of artistic good taste in Denmark.\n\nCommissions soon followed. As a first commission he was requested to sculpt a memorial monument to the long deceased king Christian VI of Denmark by his widowed wife, Sophie Magdalene. The marble monument was completed in 1768, but was not installed at Roskilde Cathedral until 1777. The neoclassical monument included a sarcophagus and two female figures, \"Sorgen\"and \"Berømmelsen\". This was the first neoclassical sarcophagus in Denmark, and is considered to be neoclassicism's start in Denmark.\n\nIn 1760 he began work on another comprehensive project, sculptural groups, individual sculptures and decorations for the gardens at the French-inspired baroque Fredensborg Palace. He produced a large series of drawings for the King giving his suggestions for the decoration of the gardens. He came to work closely with architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin, with whom he would travel together to London and Paris in the late 1760s. His outdoor sculptures here and at other gardens have come to comprise the greatest assembled collections of his works.\n\nIn 1761 he became a professor at the Art Academy. He also took on a leading position with Fourniers Porcelain Factory 1761-1766.\nWiedewelt wrote a small manifesto in 1762 entitled\"Tanker om Smagen udi Kunsterne i Almindelighed\".\n\nHe contributed to the decoration of Frederiks Church, also known as the Marble Church (\"Marmorkirken\") with no less than 64 figures and 30 reliefs. Due to the scale of the royal projects, the time constraints and the common practices of the time Wiedewelt often left the direct work of sculpting be carried out by his studio assistants from sketches, which he delivered.\n\nIn 1765-1766 he delivered a plaster allegorical relief and twelve medallions of the Oldenborg kings to the sumptuous Knights Hall (\"Riddersalen\") at Christiansborg Palace, plus additional decorative pieces. These were all lost in the fire of 1794. Some of the medallions are evidenced in engravings.\n\nHe served as Treasurer of the Academy 1767-1772, and served as Director of the same 1772-1778, 1780-1789, and 1793-1795. He exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1769, and subsequently in 1778 and 1794.\n\nIn 1769 he completed the monument to Frederik V in Roskilde Cathedral which includes a large sarcophagus resting on footpieces and decorated by numerous sculptures, behind which is a column topped of an urn, a medallion with the king's portrait, and on each side of the sarcophagus, sitting approx. 9' high above the floor, are two crowned, grieving female figures representing Denmark and Norway. The memorial chapel was created as a collaboration between Wiedewelt and architect Caspar Frederik Harsdorff.\n\nIn 1768-1769 Wiedewelt traveled to Paris and London in the company of architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin, then architect for Frederik's Church, now known as the Marble Church (\"Marmorkirken\"). His travel journals show that he visited famous gardens during the trip, and studied them carefully.\n\nLarge commissions from the court slowed down drastically after this foreign tour, as Johann Friedrich Struensee's took over control of the country from the weak, young, schizophrenic, newly crowned King Christian VII and put his cost-cutting reforms into place between 1769-1771. These cutbacks also resulted in Jardin's losing his position with the Church after this same two-year travel. German-born Struensee was widely disliked, and between 1770-1772 Wiedewelt created a series of drawings satirizing Struensee and his associate Count Enevold Brandt. He also designed several coins for Christian VII in 1771.\n\nStarting in the early 1770s, the reaction to Struensee led to a wider distrust of foreigners in positions of power in Denmark. This included the foreign-born artists, especially French artists, in the King's service who lost power and influence in Denmark's official artistic and Academic circles. Friend Jardin resigned his professorship at the Academy on 26 March 1771. \n\nFrom this point on, although Wiedewelt remained court sculptor until his death, his commissions came primarily from private patrons, and were mostly grave monuments and sarcophaguses. He received many such commissions, and during a thirty-year period he produced over 36 such works. Among these are one for Ludvig Holberg in Sorø made in 1779, and another for the first wife of Adam Gottlob Moltke, statesman and high official at the Danish Court.\n\nThe only large order he received from the court after that time was one for Høegh-Guldbergs National Historical Garden (\"Høegh-Guldbergs nationalhistoriske anlæg\") named for Ove Høegh-Guldberg, theologian and historian. The commission consisted of fifty-four monuments to be set up on the expansive grounds of Crown Prince Frederik V's Jægerspris Castle in Jægerspris. They were sculpted between 1777-1789. Wiedewelt was inspired by Ove Malling's book \"Store og gode Handlinger af Danske, Norske og Holstenere\" published in 1777. He decorated the park with monuments and memorial stones in honour of exceptional Danes, Norwegians, and Holsteiners, placing these pieces in the open parkland. He took advantage of his recent studies of foreign gardens, especially the English garden Stowe Park near Buckingham which he had visited, and created a new visual language. \n\nAdditionally his studio produced reliefs in 1773 of Hercules and Omphale for the Hercules Pavilion in the King's Garden (\"Kongens Have\"), the gardens of Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen. In 1782 he designed coin cabinets for the Royal Coin Museum (\"Det kongelige Møntkabinet\") at the same castle.\n\nIn 1783 he created Bernstorff Column (\"Bernstorffstøtten\"), a memorial for Foreign Minister Count Johan Hartvig Ernst Bernstorff in Lyngby, who had early-on instituted agricultural reforms (\"landboreformer\") on his estate, prior to the land-wide reforms that followed on 20 July 1788. \n\nThese land-wide reforms led to the monumental \"Frihedsstøtten\" in Copenhagen. Work was started August 31, 1792 and it was erected in 1797. It is still on public display although in a new location. The monument was 20 meters high and consisted of an obelisk of red sandstone, a pedestal of grey marble and a base on three steps of red sandstone before the renovation of 1998-1999. Wiedewelt contributed to this piece with the statue \"Troskaben\", which is one of four sculptures in this large piece, and with the relief \"Retfærdighedens Genius\". The other artists who contributed to the monument were Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, who designed the overall monument, colleague Andreas Weidenhaupt and Nicolai Dajon.\n\nBetween 1785-1801, Wiedewelt created fifteen monuments for the day's important people at Assistens Cemetery near Copenhagen's Northern Gate (\"Nørreport\"). Of these eight can still be seen today in the park-like setting.\n\nWiedewelt was chosen eight times as Director of the Art Academy; the last time he held the position was 1793-1794. He worked hard to keep the Academy running well, facing often-shifting attitudes from the court and uncertain royal financial support. He was committed to the end, in spite of ill health in his advanced age. \n\nHe also worked until the end, even though his own financial means worsened drastically, and he lived in abject poverty. During his many years of good economy he lived a festive life with no restrictions, and he was very generous. When times became rough, as it did not only for him but also for others who were accustomed to royal support, he suffered along with the royal house's financial problems. In spite of his meager economy he continued to support two elderly sisters, a servant man, as well as a poor cousin. He had never married.\n\nBy the end Wiedewelt had pawned most of his belongings, when a final catastrophe proved to be too much for him; a shipload of marble blocks he had purchased with borrowed money went to the bottom of the sea near Læsø. This apparently proved to be more than he could handle, and shortly thereafter on 17 December 1802 he drowned in an apparent suicide in Sortedamsøen, a lake just outside that day's Copenhagen limits.\nHe was buried on Christmas Eve at Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen. His grave monument was made by friend and colleague Andreas Weidenhaupt (1738–1805).\n\nHe had a rich fantasy, and his compositions were easy and natural. His works were tasteful, and influenced by both his French Baroque training and his careful study of and appreciation for late Greek and Roman art. He was well-versed in the use of classical allegory and symbols, especially those having to do with death. He was also inspired by Nordic mythology and ancient, Viking and Icelandic sagas, and made many drawings based on these. Sculptures and reliefs attributed to him and his studio have been lost to time, and are sometimes only evidenced by sketches and engravings.\n\nHis works are a part of the royal households and gardens. Those in the gardens are the largest collections of his works in one place. He viewed his garden decorations as creating an outdoors theatre presentation relating to the surrounding trees of various types, to figure groups of sculptures and to decorative columns and obelisks. He had a sense of the developing romantic garden. \n\nHis memorial monuments are spread out in churches throughout Denmark, with the royal monuments at Roskilde Cathedral. Many of these monuments can be found at Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen.\n\nHis drawings are also highly esteemed. He illustrated a deluxe edition of Ludvig Holberg's \"Peder Paars\" in 1772, engravings for which were made by Johan Frederik Clemens, who collaborated with Wiedewelt on several projects. He also made illustrations for a book by Peder Topp Wandal on the Jægerspris Castle project in 1783. Clemens also engraved these illustrations, \n\nWiedewelt, along with architect Harsdorff, was one of the primary figures responsible for introducing Neoclassicism to Denmark. He was highly esteemed by his contemporaries and by those artists who followed. He is considered an important transitional figure leading to future generations of Danish artists.\n\nHe had a large library of books covering many subjects, which often served as a source of inspiration. \n\nAs professor at the Academy he introduced his Neoclassical theories to artistic students. Among his many students was Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, future Director of the Academy and instructor for Bertel Thorvaldsen.\n\nIn 1803, Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger, poet and playwright, wrote a well-known elegy in his honour, calling him \"Denmark's Phidias\". \n\n\"Taus hun sukker\"<br>\n\"Bølgen mildt sig lukker\"<br>\n\"om den gamle Tindings sølvgråe Haar.\"<br>\n\"Hun forsvinder.\"<br>\n\"Dagen bleg oprinder;\"<br>\n\"Hist paa Frihedsstøtten Lærken slaaer.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Troskab græder\"<br>\n\"I de hvide Marmorklæder\"<br>\n\"Kold og bleg, den ranke hulde Mø.\"<br>\n\"Haand paa Brystet\"<br>\n\"Aldrig aldrig trøstet, \"<br>\n\"stirrer hun henpå den sorte Sø\"<br>\n<br>\nSilently she sighs<br>\nThe mild waves close in<br>\nRound the old man's tempels, his silver-grey hair. <br>\nShe disappears. <br>\nThe pale day runs out. <br>\nYonder on Freedom's Monument the lark sounds.<br>\n<br>\nFaithfulness cries<br>\nIn its white marble clothes<br>\nCold and pale, the proud gracious maiden<br>\nHand on breast<br>\nNever, never comforted<br>\nShe stares out onto the dark lake.\n"}

Soderberg was previously head coach at Lindenwood University, Saint Louis University, South Dakota State University, Loras College, and an interim head coach at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nBorn in Wausau, Wisconsin, Soderberg played basketball at Pacelli High School in Stevens Point, Wisconsin for his father, Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame Coach, Don Soderberg. Soderberg played basketball in college at Ripon College from 1980 to 1982 before he transferred to University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point, playing at Stevens Point from 1982 to 1984 under head coach Dick Bennett, and with Terry Porter (who later became player and eventually a head coach in the National Basketball Association). The 1984 team made it all the way to the championship game of the NAIA Tournament before falling 50–48 to Fort Hays State University. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point in 1985 with a degree in physical education.\n\nThen in 1986 he received his master's degree from Colorado State University in physical education. He was then hired as an assistant coach at Fort Hays State University for one season and quickly moved on to an assistant post at Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa. He became head coach of Loras in 1988 and served until 1993 compiling a record of 79–45. He was then hired as head coach of South Dakota State University where he stayed from 1993 to 1995 compiling a record of 36–18.\n\nAfter the two successful stints as a head coach at Division II schools, his former coach, Dick Bennett, hired him as his assistant at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He served as an assistant to Bennett through the 2000 season. Three games into the 2000–01 campaign, the Badgers (coming off a Final Four appearance in 2000) saw their head coach, Dick Bennett retire. Soderberg took over the heralded team and led them to a 16–10 record, but the team lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Georgia State University, considered a major disappointment to many Badger fans. Soderberg was then let go from his head coach position at the end of the season, as the Badgers hired Bo Ryan.\n\nSoderberg accepted an assistant post at Saint Louis University under head coach Lorenzo Romar. After his first season Romar was hired away to become the head coach at the University of Washington. Brad Soderberg was promoted to head coach for the 2002–03 season. His first two seasons he led the Billikens to two NIT Tournament appearances. After his first three years SLU moved from Conference USA to the Atlantic 10. Soderberg was let go after three consecutive seasons without reaching the post season. He did however have a 20 win season during his final year at Saint Louis University. He was replaced by Rick Majerus.\n\nOn April 17, 2007 St. Louis sports station KFNS announced that Soderberg had been dismissed as men's basketball coach. No longer a head coach at a college, Soderberg coached his younger son's 4th grade team at St. Cletus in St. Charles, Missouri. On July 7, 2008, Soderberg was named Interim Director of Athletics at Loras College.\n\nOn May 14, 2009, Soderberg was named head coach of Lindenwood University in Saint Charles, Missouri. In his first season as head coach of the Lions, Soderberg led the Lions to one of the best seasons in school history, a record of 23–10, and set a school record for most home wins in a season, going 13–1 at home. On March 29, 2010, the university announced the transfer of Kramer Soderberg, Missouri player of the year during his senior year of high school, from Miami University (Ohio) to join his father's program.\n\nIn his second season as head coach of the Lions, Lindenwood set a new school record for most straight wins after Defeating Missouri Valley 77–66 for the team's 12th straight win on January 6, 2011. The Lions finished the regular season 26–4 won the 2011 HAAC Regular Season Championship and earned an automatic bid to the 2011 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. The 26 wins set a new best record in school history. Soderberg led the Lions to their first NAIA Division I Tournament win when the 20th seeded Lions defeated 14th-seeded St. Catharine College 78–72. Lindenwood's defense held St. Catharine ten points below its season average and forced 13 turnovers in the game. Offensively, Lindenwood made 33 of 40 free throws. All three of Lindenwoods guards finished with double digit points, Kramer Soderberg finished with 27, Bazzell with 14 points, and Rose with 13. Soderberg's Lions eventually fell in the second round to 3rd-seeded Mountain State University, ending Lindenwood's final season in the NAIA and Heart of America Athletic Conference with the best record in school history with a 29–6 overall record.\n\nIn 2011, Lindenwood began the transition from the NAIA to the NCAA's Division II. Competing as an independent, Lindenwood finished the season with a 26–3 record and was invited to the NCAA's Division II Transitional Tournament in Spearfish, South Dakota. Soderberg led them to the Division II Transitional National champions by defeating Minot State and Sioux Falls to end the season with a final 28–3 record.\n\nLindenwood announced their entry into the Mid–America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA). Although ineligible for post-season play during the transition to Division II, Soderberg's Lions finished their first regular season in the MIAA in a third place tie in the fifteen team league.\n\nOn April 17, 2015, Soderberg was named an assistant coach at Virginia, serving under Dick Bennett's son and former Wisconsin assistant, Tony Bennett.\n\nSoderberg and his wife, Linda, have a daughter, Daley, and two sons, Kramer and Davis.\n\n"}

This law was one of the strictest religious censorship statutes ever enacted in England. In March 1401 William Sawtrey became the first Lollard to be burned.\n\nThe statute declared there were \"divers false and perverse people of a certain new sect ... they make and write books, they do wickedly instruct and inform people ... and commit subversion of the said catholic faith\". The sect alluded to is the Lollards, followers of John Wycliffe.\n\n\"De heretico comburendo\" urged \"that this wicked sect, preachings, doctrines, and opinions, should from henceforth cease and be utterly destroyed\", and declared \"that all and singular having such books or any writings of such wicked doctrine and opinions, shall really with effect deliver or cause to be delivered all such books and writings to the diocesan of the same place within forty days from the time of the proclamation of this ordinance and statute\".\n\n\"And if any person ... such books in the form aforesaid do not deliver, then the diocesan of the same place in his diocese such person or persons in this behalf defamed or evidently suspected and every of them may by the authority of the said ordinance and statute cause to be arrested\". If they failed to abjure their heretical beliefs, or relapsed after an initial abjuration, they \nwould \"be burnt, that such punishment may strike fear into the minds of others\".\n\nSection 6 of the Act of Supremacy 1558 (1 Eliz.1 c.1) (1559) repealed the statutes but it was not until March 1677 that a bill to take away the Crown's right to the writ was introduced in the House of Commons. It passed in that session.\n\n\"De heretico comburendo\" is a Latin phrase meaning \"Regarding the burning of heretics\". An alternate spelling is \"De haeretico comburendo\", reflecting the proper ancient and Middle Ages spelling (by the second century the diphthong \"ae\" had been changed in pronunciation from to ; most texts today use the spelling without the letter \"a\"). See Latin spelling and pronunciation for more information.\n\nAlthough partial English translations of the Bible had existed for hundreds of years, the Middle English translation published under the direction of John Wycliffe in the 1380s, known as Wycliffe's Bible, was the first complete translation and the first to gain widespread acceptance and use. The Church authorities condemned Wycliffe's translation because they deemed the commentary included with the work to be heretical, and because they feared a vernacular translation of the Bible from the Latin Vulgate, absent appropriate catechesis, would lead the ignorant laity to reject Church authority and fall into heresy.\n\nWycliffe was the inspiration for what would become the Lollard movement, which was considered heretical by the Church. The Constitutions of Oxford, established in 1409 by Archbishop Thomas Arundel, were further punitive measures intended to punish heresy in England that grew in large part out of the \"De heretico comburendo\".\n\n\n"}

His travels took him to the Holy Land, the Middle East, Northern Africa, and as far as India.\n\nPietro Della Valle was born in Rome on 2 April 1586, to a wealthy and noble family. His early life was spent in the pursuit of literature and arms. He was a cultivated man, who knew Latin, Greek, classical mythology, and the Bible. He also became a member of the Roman Accademia degli Umoristi, and acquired some reputation as a versifier and rhetorician. When Pietro was disappointed in love and began to consider suicide, Mario Schipano, a professor of medicine in Naples, suggested the idea of traveling in the East. It was Schipano who received a sort of diary in letters from Pietro's travels.\n\nBefore leaving Naples, Pietro took a vow to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He left Venice by boat on 8 June 1614 and reached Constantinople; he remained there for more than a year and acquired a good knowledge of Turkish and a little Arabic. On 25 September 1615, he went to Alexandria. Because he was a nobleman of distinction, he traveled with a suite of nine persons, and with every advantage due to his rank. From Alexandria he went on to Cairo, and, after an excursion to Mount Sinai, left Cairo for the Holy Land. He arrived there on 8 March 1616, in time to take part in the Easter celebrations at Jerusalem.\n\nAfter visiting the holy sites, Pietro traveled from Damascus to Aleppo. After seeing a portrait of the beautiful Assyrian Christian Sitti Maani Gioerida, he went to Baghdad and married her a month later. While in the Middle East, he made one of the first modern records of the location of ancient Babylon and provided \"remarkable descriptions\" of the site. He also brought back to Europe inscribed bricks from Nineveh and Ur, some of the first examples of Cuneiform available to modern Europeans. At that time Baghdad was being contested between Turkey and Iran during the frequent Ottoman-Persian Wars, so he had to leave Baghdad on 4 January 1617. Accompanied by his wife Maani, he proceeded to Persia, and visited Hamadan and Isfahan. In the summer of 1618, he joined Shah Abbas in a campaign in northern Persia. Here he was well received at court and treated as the Shah's guest.\n\nOn his return to Isfahan he began to think of going back home through India, rather than endanger himself again in Turkey. However, the state of his health and the war between Persia and the Portuguese at Ormuz generated problems. In October 1621 he left Isfahan, visited Persepolis and Shiraz and made his way to the coast. But it was not until January 1623 that he found a passage for Surat on the English ship \"Whale\", Captain Nicolas Woodcock.\n\nHe sojourned in India until November 1624, his headquarters being Surat and Goa. In India Pietro Della Valle was introduced to the King Vekatappa Nayaka of Keladi, South India by Vithal Shenoy, the chief administrator of those territories. The accounts of his travels are one of the most important sources of history for the region.\n\nHe was at Muscat in January 1625, and at Basra in March. In May he started by the desert route to Aleppo, and boarded on a French ship at Alexandretta. He reached Cyprus and finally Rome on 28 March 1626. There, he was received with many honors, not only in literary circles, but also from Pope Urban VIII, who appointed him a gentleman of his bedchamber. The rest of his life was uneventful; he married his second wife, Mariuccia (Tinatin de Ziba), a Georgian orphan of a noble family. She had been adopted by his first wife as a child, had traveled with him, and was the mother of fourteen children. \nHe died in Rome on 21 April 1652, and is buried at his family's burial vault at Santa Maria in Aracoeli.\n\nBy 1665 the portion of his \"Travels\" dealing with India and with his return had been translated into English. They contain accounts of his discussions with \"Hindoo\" Brahmans about whether the Egyptians or Indians first came up with the concept of reincarnation, a dialogue with a woman who invited him to her upcoming sati, a description of the barefoot Queen of Olaza (Abbakka Chowta, Ullal), who was out on the embankments giving directions to her engineers—and many other bits of first-rate ethnography.\n\nApart from his activities as an ethnographer, Della Valle was also a composer and a writer of theoretical treatises on music. He composed several dialogues (actually brief oratorios) on biblical subjects. His only preserved work is an oratorio composed for l'Oratorio del Croficisso di Saint Marcello, where he experiments with musical modes and scales inspired by ancient music theory. For this purpose, he developed two new instruments, such as a \"violone panharmonico\" and a \"cembalo triharmonico\". Notwithstanding his interest in ancient musical practices, in his theoretical writings on music (e.g. \"Della musica dell'età nostra che non è punto inferiore, anzi è migliore di quella dell'età passata\", Rome 1640, and \"Note … sopra la musica antica e moderna, indirizzato al Sig.r Nicolò Farfaro\", 1640/41), he praises the modern music culture in contemporary Rome and defended the modern music against the criticism of Nicolò Farfaro, an Italian musician of his times.\n\nPietro Della Valle also wrote texts and librettos for several musical spectacles, such as \"Il carro di fedeltà d'Amore\", (music by his teacher of harpsichord Paolo Quagliati, performed in Rome in 1606 and printed in 1611), and \"La valle rinverdita\" (written in celebration of the birth of his first child in 1629, now lost).\n\n\nPietro Della Valle was also a famous book collector. \"In a letter written in Damascus and Aleppo, dated June 15, 1616, della Valle described his delight at finding some rare Samaritan manuscripts, some of them with glosses in Arabic, for sale.\"\n\n\n\nFor excerpts of the early English translation and for further information:\n\n"}

Two major cathedrals, the Kazan Cathedral, Moscow, and the Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg, are consecrated to Our Lady of Kazan, and they display copies of the icon, as do numerous churches throughout the land. The original icon in Kazan was stolen, and likely destroyed, in 1904. \n\nThe \"Fátima image\" is a 16th-century copy of the icon, or possibly the 16th-century original, stolen from St. Petersburg in 1917 and purchased by F. A. Mitchell-Hedges in 1953. It was housed in Fátima, Portugal from 1970 to 1993, then in the study of Saint Pope John Paul II in the Vatican from 1993 to 2004, when it was returned to Kazan, where it is now kept in the Kazan Monastery of the Theotokos. Copies of the image are also venerated in the Catholic Church.\n\nFeast days of Our Lady of Kazan are 21 July, and 4 November (which is also the Russian Day of National Unity).\n\nAccording to tradition, the original icon of Our Lady of Kazan was brought to Russia from Constantinople in the 13th century. After the establishment of the Khanate of Kazan ( 1438) the icon disappeared from the historical record for more than a century.\n\nMetropolitan Hermogenes' chronicle, written at the request of Tsar Feodor in 1595, describes the recovery of the icon. According to this account, after a fire destroyed Kazan in 1579, the Virgin appeared to a 10-year-old girl, Matrona, revealing the location where the icon lay hidden. The girl told the archbishop about the dream but she was not taken seriously. However, on 8 July 1579, after two repetitions of the dream, the girl and her mother recovered the icon on their own, buried under a destroyed house where it had been hidden to save it from the Tatars. \n\nRussian military commanders Dmitry Pozharsky (17th century) and Mikhail Kutuzov (19th century) credited invocation of the Virgin Mary through the icon with helping the country to repel the Polish invasion of 1612, the Swedish invasion of 1709, and Napoleon's invasion of 1812. The Kazan icon achieved immense popularity, and there were nine or ten separate miracle-attributed copies of the icon around Russia.\n\nOn the night of June 29, 1904, the icon was stolen from the in Kazan where it had been kept for centuries (the building was later blown up by the communist authorities). Thieves apparently coveted the icon's gold frame, which was ornamented with many valuable jewels. Several years later, Russian police apprehended the thieves and recovered the frame. The thieves originally declared that the icon itself had been cut to pieces and burnt, although one of them eventually confessed that it was housed in a monastery in the wilds of Siberia. This one, however, was believed to be a fake, and the Russian police refused to investigate, using the logic that it would be very unlucky to venerate a fake icon as though it were authentic. The Orthodox Church interpreted the disappearance of the icon as a sign of tragedies that would plague Russia after the image of the Holy Protectress of Russia had been lost. Indeed, the Russian peasantry was wont to credit all the miseries of the Revolution of 1905, as well as Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, to the desecration of her image.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, there was speculation that the original icon was in fact preserved in St. Petersburg. Reportedly, an icon of Our Lady of Kazan was used in processions around Leningrad fortifications during the Siege of Leningrad (1941-1944) during World War II. \n\nAnother theory proposed that the Bolsheviks had sold the image abroad, although the Russian Orthodox Church did not accept such theories. The history of the stolen icon between 1917 and 1953 is unknown. In 1953 Frederick Mitchell-Hedges purchased an icon from Arthur Hillman. \nAlthough the status of the icon as the original Kazan icon remained disputed, Cyril G.E. Bunt concluded \"that it is the work of a great icon painter of the 16th century [...] the pigments and the wood of the panel are perfectly preserved as exhaustive X-ray tests have proved, and have mellowed with age\", suggesting that while it was a copy of the original icon, it was nevertheless the original icon carried by Pozharski in 1612. It was exhibited at the World Trade Fair in New York in 1964-1965. On 13 September 1965, members of the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima spent the night in veneration of the icon in the pavilion in New York. The Blue Army eventually bought the icon from Anna Mitchell-Hedges for US$125,000 in January 1970, and the icon was enshrined in Fátima, Portugal.\n\nIn 1993 the icon from Fátima was given to Pope John Paul II, who took it to the Vatican and had it installed in his study, where he venerated it for eleven years. In his own words, \"it has found a home with me and has accompanied my daily service to the Church with its motherly gaze\". John Paul II wished to visit Moscow or Kazan to personally return the icon to the Russian Orthodox Church. When the Moscow Patriarchate rejected this plan, the Pope presented the icon to the Russian Church unconditionally in August 2004. On August 26, 2004, it was exhibited for veneration on the altar of St. Peter's Basilica and then delivered to Moscow. On the next feast day of the holy icon, July 21, 2005, Patriarch Alexius II and Mintimer Shaymiev, the president of Tatarstan, placed it in the .\n\nThe icon is enshrined in the Cathedral of the Elevation of the Holy Cross, part of the erstwhile Convent of the Theotokos (re-established as a monastery in 2005), on the site where the original icon of Our Lady of Kazan was found, and plans are underway to make the monastery's other buildings into an international pilgrimage centre.\n\n\n"}

Wharton\n\nWilliam Harris Wharton (April 27, 1802 – March 14, 1839) was an American colonist, diplomat, senator and statesman in early Texas.\n\nWharton was born in Virginia and was raised by an uncle following the deaths of his parents. He graduated from the University of Nashville and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1826. Afterward, Wharton moved to Mexican Texas, and on December 5, 1827, married Sarah Ann Groce, the daughter of a wealthy landowner. Their only child was a son, John A. Wharton (1828–1865), who served in the American Civil War as a Confederate major general. The Wharton family established a farm known as Eagle Island Plantation.\n\nWharton served as a delegate to the Convention of 1832 from the District of Victoria. The convention unanimously elected him to deliver the resolutions to the legislature of Coahuila y Tejas (then a part of Mexico) in Saltillo and to the Mexican Congress in Mexico City. Following that convention's unsuccessful attempts to form a new state separate from Coahuila y Tejas, Wharton served as president of the follow-up Convention of 1833 and openly advocated complete independence from Mexico, in contrast to the moderate view held by native Texans and others like Stephen F. Austin. Wharton later served as a delegate from the Columbia district to the Texas Consultation of 1835.\n\nWharton entered military service during the Texas Revolution, serving as a colonel and judge advocate general. He participated in the siege of San Antonio de Béxar in the fall of 1835. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed as one of three commissioners to the United States to secure aid for the Texians.\n\nAfter the revolution resulted in the formation of the Republic of Texas in 1836, Wharton supported Austin's unsuccessful candidacy for president, which was instead won by Sam Houston. Wharton served as a member of the new republic's senate from the District of Brazoria in 1836.\n\nIn November, President Houston appointed Wharton as minister to the United States, hoping to secure political recognition and possible annexation. Returning to Texas in 1837 by sea, Wharton was captured by a Mexican ship and carried to Matamoros, where he was imprisoned. He escaped (allegedly by wearing a nun's habit) and returned to Texas to be re-elected to the Texas Senate in 1838.\n\nWharton introduced the \"Lone Star\" flag to Congress on December 28, and may have designed it.\n\nWharton accidentally shot and killed himself while dismounting from his horse near Hempstead in Waller County, Texas, on March 14, 1839. He was buried at Restwood Memorial Park in Clute, Texas.\n\nBoth Wharton County, Texas, and its county seat, Wharton, were named for him and his brother John Austin Wharton (1806–1838), who was likewise a statesman of the Republic of Texas.\n\n\n"}

The Indian troops won a hard-fought battle that secured this area in the Punjab/Jammu sector. The name Battle of Basantar actually encompasses the entire gamut of battles and skirmishes fought in the Shakargarh sector.\n\nBasantar river is a tributary of the Ravi River that flows in the states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. This battle took place in the Shakargarh Sector or the Shakargarh Bulge that includes Jarpal and surrounding areas. The bulge is a protrusion of Pakistan boundary into Indian territory. It was a strategic area for both sides as it comprised road links to Jammu from Punjab, which could be cut off by Pakistan if it wished to launch an offensive. It was also economically vital for both sides as it straddled the fertile area of the Indus river belt.\n\nAs the war began on the eastern front, Pakistan decided to open up the western sector to divert Indian troops from the Eastern front in Bangladesh and prolong the war. Shakargarh bulge was a key strategic area for India as it comprised road links between Jammu and Indian Punjab. Therefore, securing the region was crucial for India as Pakistan had a military base nearby in Sialkot and therefore could have easily launched a massive invasion of the Shakargarh region, cutting Jammu and Kashmir from the rest of India. The Indian Army maintained a base at Pathankot, twenty three miles away from Shakargarh and quickly mobilized forces to defend the region. In an attempt to gain advantage through the element of surprise, the Indian Army, though outnumbered, attacked Pakistani positions in Jarpal area, triggering the Battle of Basantar.\n\nBoth the opposing sides were led by their army's I Corps. Pakistan's I Corps included three infantry divisions, one armoured division, an armoured brigade backed up by an unknown number of artillery and support units. Furthermore, Pakistan had the advantage of bringing in the reserve troops stationed nearby. The reserves totalled 5 divisions, commanded by Lt. General Irshad Hassan Khan, who as DMI (Director Military Intelligence) had failed to act in the 1965 War in spite of intercepting Indian war plans.\n\nDavid R. Higgins suggests that the Pakistani forces included the 8th Infantry Division with four brigades, the 15th Infantry Division, the 8th Armoured Brigade with the 13th Lancers, 27th Cavalry, 31st Cavalry (Pakistan), and possibly 15th (SP) Regiment and 29th Battalion, Frontier Force Regiment attached.\n\nThe Indian I Corps had three infantry divisions, two Armoured Brigades, two independent artillery brigades and an engineer brigade. The aim of the Indian Army was to bridge the Basantar river — the entry to which was fully land mined — and take control of the Shakargarh bulge. It was reasoned that such an offensive would also secure the Pathankot army base from any attacks from Pakistan.\n\nThe offensive in this sector was launched a few days after war broke out between the two nations. The Indian I Corps moved into the sector to capture the key areas. The 54 Infantry Division under Major General WAG Pinto and 16 Armoured Brigade moved towards the area. As they advanced they were met series of minefields and by stiff Pakistani resistance. A troop of T-55 Tanks with trawls, created and trained by Capt. JDS Jind, of the 7th Light Cavalry were attached for trawling with 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade at the outbreak of hostilities on 3 December 1971, during the Indo-pak war. The entire trawling ahead of 54 Infantry Division, led by 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade was done by this troop. This allowed the Tanks to move ahead before the \"all vehicle safe lane was cleared by the Engineers. Thus, while the Indian division was bogged down as the engineers had not cleared all the mines, 2nd Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal of the 17 Poona Horse, in a daring counter-attack, led his 3 tanks into the minefield area. A fierce tank battle ensued where a Pakistani tank was taken down. After suffering initial setbacks, the 8th Armoured Brigade of Pakistan was called in to help the Pakistani resistance in the area. However, the Indian Army continued the assault and Lt. Arun Khetarpal with his 2 remaining tanks fought off and destroyed 10 tanks before he was killed in action. Following the defeat in the battle, Pakistan launched a massive counter-attack which was planned in five phases:\n\n\nAfter days of intense fighting that saw both sides gaining and losing territory, the battle was turning into a stalemate. However, despite being at a quantitative and qualitative disadvantage, Indian troops made massive gains during the final days of the battle and also repelled the Pakistani thrust. Towards the tail end of the battle, Pakistan Army's Lieutenant Colonel Akram Raja made a frantic attempt to counter-attack the Indian stronghold near Shakargarh by jumping into an old-style cavalry charge with his tanks. Launched in broad daylight in view of the Indian defensive positions which were well secured, the campaign was a disaster. The Indians continued their military thrust deep inside Pakistan and came threateningly close to the Pakistan Army base at Sialkot. Because of being outnumbered by the advancing Indian Army, the Pakistan Army called-in the Pakistan Air Force to repel the Indian attack on the base. Expecting another massive assault by the Indian Army, this time backed by Indian Air Force-support, and in no position to launch any counter-offensive operations in the region, Pakistan offered unconditional surrender which led to ceasefire. India had gained control of more than thousand square miles before finally settling down to - 1000 km² of Pakistan territory that included approximately 500 villages. 1 corps has 6 trawls from 7 cavalry under command of Capt. JDS Jind, that cleared 6 of the 9 attempted lanes, paving way for the Indian tanks to advance ahead.\n\nPakistani tanks destroyed by Indian tanks inducted into enemy territory through a safe passage created by the Sappers of 9 Engineer Regiment.\n\nOn December 5, 1971, at about 7.30 pm, 2/Lt NP Singh of 9 Engineer Regiment left with his task force for Dera Post from where they started laying an operational track for the Indian offensive. At about 9.30 pm, the leading task force entered Pakistani territory. The Regiment's Commanding Officer, Lt Col BT Pandit, after briefly supervising this specialised task, proceeded ahead in order to guide his men. He came out very successfully in this delicate task. He was later awarded with the coveted Vir Chakra..\n\nOn December 6, at about 2.30 pm, the track was completed up to Badala-Gujran in Pakistan. On December 7, for breaching the minefield in area Thakurdwara, 404 Field Company of 9 Engineer Regiment was placed under the command of 47 Infantry Brigade from 8 pm onwards. Nearby, the other field company of 9 Engineer Regiment - 405 Field Company-in conjunction with trawls, breached a vehicle safe lane, five metre-wide and 500 metre-long, in one hour. Thereafter, a field company of 5 Engineer Regiment and a platoon of 404 Field Company widened this lane by one metre.\n\nOn December 8, 404 Field Company, on completing its task with 47 Infantry Brigade, was earmarked for providing engineer support to 91 Infantry Brigade. Simultaneously, 405 Field Company was rendered engineering support for the advance of 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade in the area south and south-west of Bari. Meanwhile, 406 Field Company extended the operational track beyond Tarakwal. On December 9, 404 Field Company was earmarked for 76 Infantry Brigade. The operational track was then connected to Bari following which the maintenance of the entire length of track continued.\n\nOn the night of December 10/11, a platoon of 405 Field Company, deployed with 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade and commanded by Nb Sub Doraiswamy, was employed on minefield breaching task with trawls. At about 11pm, the build-up of armour into the bridgehead was seriously hampered as one of the damaged Indian tanks obstructed traffic through the lane. Reopening of the lane was of utmost importance in order to successfully ensure the defence of the bridgehead, which would have otherwise been seriously jeopardised.\n\nNb Sub Doraiswamy, on his own initiative, took a small party forward through the Pakistani artillery barrage and succeeded in hand-breaching a detour round the stalled tank ensuring speedy induction of Indian armour and essential infantry support weapons through the minefield and into the bridgehead. For displaying this exemplary courage he was honoured with Vir Chakra.\n\nOn December 11, a diversion on Road Mawa-Pangdaur was constructed for the free movement of vehicles. Three reconnaissance patrols of 404 Field Company advanced with 91 Infantry Brigade to three different points for minefield reconnaissance. A second minefield lane was lined with the operational track on December 12. Simultaneously, 405 Field Company also cleared a minefield lane for the Armoured Brigade and, on December 13 night, it breached an enemy minefield with trawls 1,300 metre-deep, north of Lohara and further extended it up to Lohara.\n\nOn December 15, an Engineer Task Force comprising elements of 404, 405 and 406 Field Companies was grouped with 47 Infantry Brigade for crossing Basantar in Lagwal area.The task involved extension of the operational track from Lohara to Lagwal, breaching of an enemy minefield at Basantar, improvement of crossing places in the riverbed and construction of crossing places on two boggy nullahs which were subsidiary obstacles.\n\nThe work commenced at 8 pm on December 15 and was carried out under intense Pakistani small arms, tanks and artillery fire. The Task Force, under Maj VR Choudhary, was deployed for breaching minefield and constructing a passage for tanks and other vehicles through the river Basantar in Lagwal area. On reaching the obstacle at about 8.30 pm, the Task Force found the situation very confusing on account of intense shelling and small arms fire which was further aggravated because of scanty information about the obstacle itself. As conventional reconnaissance would have taken considerable time, the Task Force Commander decided to disregard normal drills and safety precautions and to send a small party on a wide frontage at normal walking speed.\n\nSensing the urgency of the situation, Capt Revinder Nath Gupta volunteered for this hazardous task and led a small party of junior commissioned officer and two other ranks right up to the far edge of the minefield. Despite the grave risk involved and very intense enemy fire, he and his party brought back vital data by 9.30 pm which enabled the task to be successfully completed by 2.30 pm on December 16.\n\nThis enabled 17 Horse with two companies to be inducted into the bridgehead by 3 pm, well in time to take on the enemy's counter-attacks and eventually led to the destruction of his armoured formation west of river Basantar. Subsequently, when the enemy put up in a counter-attack, Capt Gupta personally guided tanks of 17 Horse through the cleared minefield lane for which marking was still in progress. While working on improving the crossing, he was among those killed on December 17 by enemy artillery fire which also claimed the lives of Majors VR Choudhary and SS Malik, 2/Lt KM Mandanna, two junior commissioned officers and two other ranks. Maj SP Sharma and 12 other ranks were also wounded in the shelling. For their exemplary bravery, Maj VR Choudhary and Capt Ravinder Nath Gupta were posthumously decorated with Maha Vir Chakra and Vir Chakra respectively.\n\nOperations ceased at 8 pm on December 17. The War Diary of the regiment records: “After overcoming the initial shock of the death of our gallant officers and junior commissioned officers, the Thambis’morale is high and we are prepared to breach more Basantars.\"\n\nFor their heroic exploits, the 9 Engineer Regiment was bestowed the Battle Honor \"Basantar\" and Theatre Honor \"Punjab\" and is proudly called \"Basantar Regiment or Basantar R\" the companies called Barkhania, Chakra, Thakurdwara and Lohra.\n\nInvading Shakargarh bulge was one of the most crucial components of Pakistan's war strategy in the western sector. Pakistan hoped that by occupying the bulge, the main link between Indian Army positions in Kashmir and Pathankot would be cut-off, following which, it could easily invade Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistani military forces stationed in Sialkot base would keep Pathankot at bay, thwarting any Indian attempts to recapture Shakargarh. However, Pakistan's battle plans were jeopardized because of the ingenuity of a bold attack by the Indians. The Indian Army attacked Pakistani positions in the region within four days of the declaration of the state of war, catching the Pakistanis by complete surprise. After a few days of intense fighting, the Indians had not only pushed the Pakistanis back, but had also come close to capturing Sialkot.\n\nPakistan Army generally regards this as their most humbling defeat, next only to the Battle of Longewala despite some numerical and qualitative superiority over the opposing force, the entire military campaign in the region was not successful for Pakistan. In this battle alone, India had destroyed close to 46 tanks losing only a few in the process. Pakistan's Hamoodur Rahman Commission recommended that the Commander 1 Corps, who \"surrendered to the enemy without a fight\" should \"be tried for criminal and wilful neglect of duty\" and poor conduct of operations, that \"seriously jeopardized the Army offensive in the south. The Indian Army, on the other hand, was criticized for their somewhat timid handling of the attack on Sialkot. The army, however, in its defense stated that it was planning another assault on Sialkot with assistance from the Indian Air Force, when the cease-fire was declared.\n\nThis and other battles put paid to any hopes of bargaining for territory lost in East Pakistan, by capturing Indian territory; in fact Pakistan had lost sizeable portions of land on both sides of the border.\n\nThe Pakistan Patton tank, now an attraction for visitors to the Tank Bund Road in the South Indian city of Hyderabad, is a War Trophy given to the 54th Infantry Division, and is one that the Indian Army had disabled during the Battle of Basantar in Pakistan, between December 15–17, 1971. The 47 Infantry Brigade, part of the 54th Infantry Division, was christened \"Basantar Brigade\" after the war.\n\nLt Col Mohammed Akram Raja was awarded Hilal-i-Jurat by the Pakistan Government on the basis of a citation written by Lt Col Ved Airy, who was Commanding Officer, 3 Grenadiers, Indian Army\n\n\n"}

The USAAC placed an order for a prototype on 25 November 1939, designating it XP-50, but it lost the competition to the Lockheed XP-49.\n\nFirst assigned Design 34, later G-41 by the builder, Grumman, the design was entered into competition alongside proposals from Bell, Brewster, Curtiss, Lockheed, and Vought. The XP-50 design was similar to that of the XF5F-1 with modifications to the fuselage nose to house the nose-wheel of the tricycle landing gear and provisions for self-sealing fuel tanks and pilot armor. The planned armament was two 20 mm (.79 in) cannon and two .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns.\n\nDuring testing, the XP-50 prototype (39-2517) was lost on 14 May 1941, falling victim to a turbo-supercharger explosion that destroyed the aircraft. The test pilot Robert Hall bailed out while the XP-50 plunged into Smithtown Bay in Long Island Sound.\n\nBased upon experience with the XF5F-1 and the XP-50, Grumman had begun work on a more advanced fighter, designated model G-51. Thus, the USAAC decided to replace the XP-50 with the newer design and recommended procurement of two G-51s, designated XP-65, using the original XP-50 expenditure order to cover the development. Consideration was given to combining the Air Corps and Navy requirements into a common design, but the weight and performance penalties inherent in conflicting requirements were considered great enough that separate designs would be needed. Since the U.S. Navy considered Grumman one of its major production sources and that producing two different model aircraft by Grumman would impede manufacture of aircraft types the U.S. Navy needed, it was decided that development of the XF7F-1 would continue, and the XP-65 as a parallel development was abandoned.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181526", "title": "College athletics in the United States", "text": "College athletics in the United States\n\nCollege athletics in the United States or college sports in the United States refers primarily to sports and athletic competition organized and funded by institutions of tertiary education (universities, or colleges in American English).\n\nIn the United States, college athletics is a two-tiered system.\nThe first tier includes the sports that are sanctioned by one of the collegiate sport governing bodies. The major sanctioning organizations include the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). Individual sports not governed by umbrella organizations like the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA are overseen by their own organizations, such as the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association, National Collegiate Boxing Association, USA Rugby, National Collegiate Roller Hockey Association and Intercollegiate Rowing Association. Additionally, the first tier is characterized by selective participation, since only the elite programs in their sport are able to participate; some colleges offer athletic scholarships to intercollegiate sports competitors. The second tier includes all intramural and recreational sports clubs, which are available to a larger portion of the student body. Competition between student clubs from different colleges, not organized by and therefore not representing the institutions or their faculties, may also be called \"intercollegiate\" athletics or simply college sports.\n\nUnlike in the rest of the world, in the United States today, many college sports are extremely popular on both regional and national scales, in many cases competing with professional championships for prime broadcast, print coverage and for the top athletes. The average university sponsors at least twenty different sports and offers a wide variety of intramural sports as well. In total, there are approximately 400,000 men and women student-athletes that participate in sanctioned athletics each year. The largest collegiate sanctioning organization is the NCAA, and the sport that most schools participate in is basketball, with 2,197 men's and women's basketball teams at all levels. A close second is cross country (with 2,065 NCAA teams) and baseball/softball is third (1,952).\n\nPrinciples for inter-collegiate athletics include \"gender equity, sportsmanship and ethical conduct, sound academic standards, nondiscrimination, diversity within governance, rules compliance, amateurism, competitive equity, recruiting, eligibility, financial aid, playing and practice seasons, postseason competition and contests sponsored by non-collegiate organizations, and the economy of athletic program operations to ensure fair play and equality throughout all college athletic programs and associations.\"\n\nThe first organized college sports club was formed in 1843 when Yale University created a boat club. Harvard University then followed in their footsteps, creating a similar boat club a year later. These boat clubs participated in rowing races called Regattas. The creation of these organizations set the stage for the first intercollegiate sporting event in the U.S. This event took place in 1852, when the rowing team from Yale competed against the rowing team from Harvard at Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. This marked the beginning of intercollegiate competition and followed by the creation of numerous college athletic organizations. This historic race sparked the venerable rivalry between the two schools, and the Yale-Harvard Regatta is considered the cornerstone of intercollegiate athletic competition in the United States.\n\nIn the late 1850s, bat and ball games had started to become highly known and the sport of baseball was starting to become an establishment at U.S. universities. The first intercollegiate baseball game took place in 1859 between Amherst College and Williams College. The popularity of collegiate baseball increased from this point, and by 1870, college teams were playing extensive schedules. In 1879, the first official intercollegiate baseball league was formed. The first intercollegiate cricket match took place May 7, 1864 between the University of Pennsylvania and Haverford College. Track and field also grew in popularity during this time, and the first intercollegiate track and field event occurred in 1873. This competition featured a two-mile race between athletes from Amherst College, Cornell University, and McGill University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The first intercollegiate soccer match in the U.S. took place on November 6, 1869, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, when clubs from Princeton and Rutgers played under rules modified from those of association football. The first intercollegiate rugby game took place on May 15, 1874, at Cambridge, Massachusetts when Harvard played against McGill University. The first intercollegiate football game between teams from Rutgers College (now Rutgers University) and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) took place on November 6, 1869 at College Field (now the site of the College Avenue Gymnasium at Rutgers University) in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\nIn addition to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), there are other collegiate multi-sport athletic organizations, some of which also have hundreds of member schools. These include:\n\n\nThere are a number of single sport-organizations, including leagues and conferences (see \"List of college athletic conferences in the United States\"), as well as governing bodies that sponsor collegiate championships (see \"Intercollegiate sports team champions\").\n\nDuring the early 1840s, student-athletes contributed actively to all phases of administration and control. Student athletes were involved in the sporting process, made athletic procedures and regulations for universities and also played an important role in determining which sporting events would and would not happen on universities. Today, the kind of involvement on the part of the athlete is virtually unheard of, with the only remnants of student participation in athlete administration being programs in which student governments have some control over the distribution of free allocations to athletics. Furthermore, this movement today focuses on the role of intercollegiate sports in the United States rather than the contributions of the student athlete.\n\nAcademic curriculum and requirements affect student athletes:\n\n\"When academic and athletic departments have conflicting aims, problems arise that affect the entire institution. American society values the elitism of academics and athletics in a manner that provokes conflict for participants in both domains. At various colleges, it is believed that academic elitism can be constructed on athletic elitism: Athletic teams aspire to be national champions, while their affiliate academic institutions seek national rankings. However, the means by which coaches and faculty achieve national reputations can create conflict for student athletes attempting to exist in both environments. Although both aspire to excel, the different measures of excellence for academics and athletics necessitates compromise by those who are placed in both settings.\" This policy, attempted by a large number of colleges, works for only a few.\n\nCollege administrators have the challenge of balancing university values while maximizing the revenue generated by their athletic department. To maintain financial sustainability, several athletic directors have stated that the elimination of men's non-revenue programs is the only way to balance their athletic budgets. Men's non-revenue sport teams will likely be facing declining financial support in future generations.\n\n\"Division I institutions are required to have seven athletic teams for men and seven for women (or six for men and eighth for women). As well, there must be two team sports for each gender, and each gender must have a team in each of the three season (i. e., Fall, Winter, Spring). Excluding basketball and football, teams must play 100% of their minimum number of games against Division 1 opponents, and 50% of games above the minimum number must be played against Division I teams. Men's and women's basketball teams must play all but two of their contests against Division 1 opponents, and men must play at least one third of their games in their home arena. In Division I, football is further sectioned into FBS (NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision), and FCS (Football Championship Subdivision). FBS schools must play at least 60% of their games against other FBS opponents, and demonstrate their ability to attract a high level of spectatorship.\" Additionally, college football bowl eligibility rules mandate that only one win over an FCS team can be counted toward the six required for eligibility; this in turn means that FBS teams typically schedule at most one game against an FCS team in a given season.\n\nCollege athletics has been popular since the 1920s and its popularity has increased as the games are being televised. Also, college sports are important both culturally and economically. Intercollegiate athletics creates a culturally and racially diverse setting for academics and athletics.  Economically some schools are benefiting from their athletic programs through ticket sales, merchandise sales, and outside donations.\n\nCollege sports in the United States is measured by the large number of universities that participate in more than 24 different NCAA sports. This allows more than 460,000 student-athletes, both male and female, to participate in those NCAA sports. As of the late 80’s Division 1 program employed over 75 coaches, trainers, and administrative staff as full-time faculty to support their athletic programs.\nSeveral American colleges, Division 1 and 2, offer scholarships to over 190,000 athletes. Every year these division 1 and 2 schools spend over 3 billion in athletic-scholarships. American college sports are popular worldwide with over 20,000 international athletes participating in college athletics.,\n\nAnother reason for the importance of college athletics in the U.S. is the important role it plays in the hierarchy of sport organizations. In his article about collegiate sports programs, Thomas Rosandich refers to a \"performance pyramid\", which shows the general progression of athletic organizations in the United States. At the bottom of this pyramid is youth sports organizations, since these organizations have participation open to nearly everyone. As the pyramid progresses, the level of competition increases, while the number of competitors decreases until the highest level of organized sport, professional sports, is reached. In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.\n\nBefore 1910 sports were not strictly regulated which caused a number of injuries to the athletes and in some severe cases  death. President Roosevelt took action and formed the Intercollegiate Athletic Association (IAA) which is now known as the NCAA. The NCAA was put into place to create rules for intercollegiate sports. During the 1920s-1950s there was still not much regulation of sports and the NCAA created the Committee on Infractions to replace the Sanity Code in 1951. This committee was created to give some structure to the recruitment process. The NCAA also wanted to improve competition between school, so in the early 1970s they divided schools into divisions by their competitive ability. Those divisions today are known as Division 1, Division 2, and  Division 3. Throughout the 1980s and 90s college athletics grew along with the revenue because of the game being shown on television. As of 2017-18 school year there was nearly 500,000 students who participated in college athletics.\n\nThere are large amounts of money gained from Division 1 athletics, but only a small number of schools benefits from their programs. During 2014 the NCAA earned $989 million in revenue, with a profit around $80.5 million dollars. Each year television, advertisements, and licensing revenue also adds to the NCAA profit, but donations, ticket sales, and merchandise sales goes to the school. From marketing and television fees the NCAA gained nearly $753.5 million in 2014. In 2010, two of the most profitable college conferences—the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Big Ten—earned over one billion dollars and $905 million, respectively. The University of Texas' football program, the most valuable in college sports, is estimated by Forbes to be worth over 133 million dollars, totaling over a billion dollars in the last decade. Texas makes, on average, $93 million a year just from the football program. The two schools that follow Texas, Georgia and Penn State, each make around $70 million a year. A smaller football program such as Notre Dame has a 9-year contract with NBC for 15 million a year. The average revenue per conference in 1999 was $13.5 million.\n\nUniversities spend a very large amount of money on their college organizations in the facilities, coaches, equipment, and other aspects. In most states, the person with the highest taxpayer-provided base salary is a public college football or basketball coach. This figure does not include coaches at private colleges.\n\nBy 2015, most Division 1 schools have established single-source contracts, which supplies the university with apparel for all athletic programs. The contract deal made college history when the University of Michigan and Nike made a 11-year contract deal for almost $200,000,000.\n\nMany athletic programs do not make enough money to cover the cost to maintain those programs, so they use student fees to fund their programs. This could cause some problems because of the increase in student debt and limited academic budgets. As of 2016 only 23 out of 228 Division 1 programs earned enough money to make up for their extreme spending. Due to donations, 16 of the 23 schools were able to cover their expenses, so truly only 7 of the  228 universities broke even due to their athletic programs. For the other 203 schools that did not break even, they are partially funded by the state or student fees. Most of the money that is being spent is used to pay the coaching staff, for the games, and the top of the line facilities. The amount spent on an athlete is seven times more than the average amount spent per student. At big Division 1 programs, the amount of money that is spent on a football player exceeds $90,000.\n\nTitle IX (of the Education Amendments of 1972) — which requires gender equity for boys and girls in every educational program that receives federal funding — has specifically made an impact on the distribution of college athletes by sex since its passing in 1972. The law states that:\n\nIn 1975, the final clause of Title IX was signed into law and included provisions prohibiting sex discrimination in athletics. The regulations pertaining to athletics require that an institution which sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics shall provide \"equal athletic opportunity\" for members of both sexes.\n\nSince the passing of Title IX, many NCAA institutions have had problems with the compliance of these regulations. In order to successfully comply with Title IX requirements, NCAA institutions must meet one of the requirements in the \"three prong test\" as follows: \n\nOCR (Office of Civil Rights) is one of the governing bodies that attempts to ensure that title IX is enforced. They have the power to pull federal funding from schools or organizations that are found to be non-compliant with title IX, although this power has never been exercised. The OCR will usually work with the school or organization that is non-compliant to set up a schedule or plan to follow to become compliant.\n\nResearch concerning Title IX institutional compliance and gender equity issues has found that: \n\nThe Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women was founded in 1971, evolving out of the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women founded in 1967. In its peak, the AIAW had almost 1,000 member schools. The National Junior College Athletic Association established a women's division in 1975. In the early 1980s, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and the National Collegiate Athletic Association began sponsoring intercollegiate championships for women, and the AIAW discontinued operation after the 1981-82 season.\n\nTitle IX has had a considerable impact on college athletics. Since its passing, Title IX has allowed for female participation to almost double in college sports. Before the law was passed in 1972 fewer than 30,000 girls participated in college sports; as of 2011 more than 200,000 girls participated in college sports. Title IX has been both credited with and blamed for a lot of things that have happened in college athletics since 1972.\n\nStudies on the gender equity of sports found on college campuses have provided an examination of how Title IX is perceived. Questions have been raised over the equity between male and female student athletes. Females, regardless of whether an administrator, coach, or athlete, thought there to be less equity than males when it comes to these five factors: program support, financial support, sports offerings, scheduling, and changes in the past two to three years.\n\nIn regards to the concept of \"pay-for-play,\" (see section below, \"Debate over paying athletes\") Title IX is generally seen as a substantial roadblock, only because of the differences between big-time men's sports (football/men's basketball) and women's sports, but also because of the gap between those \"big two\" sports' profit-producing programs and virtually all other collegiate sports, both male and female. Depending on how one views \"pay for play,\" this can be either a positive of negative effect of Title IX.\n\nIn addition, Title IX legislation has affected male athletes as well as male coaches. Title IX has been associated with the cutting of opportunities available for men and boys. As budgets are stretched to accommodate additional programming requirements for women and girls. More than 2,200 men's athletic teams have been eliminated since 1981 to comply with the proportionality prong of Title IX requirements. Thousands of male athletes have been kept from participating in collegiate sports while men's athletic scholarships and coaching positions have diminished as well.\n\nIncreases in opportunities for male coaches, however, have resulted from Title IX legislation. Before Title IX, 90 percent of women's intercollegiate teams were coached by women. By 1978, when all educational institutions were required to comply with Title IX, the percentage of same-sex coaching had plunged to 58 percent. Although the actual number of female coaches increased between 1979 and 1986, the percentage of female coaches continued to decline over that same period. The all-time low of 47 percent of women coaching female sports was achieved in 1990. In addition, although men have broken into coaching female athletes, female coaches have not experienced the same opportunities to coach male athletes. In 1972, 99 percent of collegiate men's teams were coached by men, and the same is true today.\n\nTitle IX has increased opportunities for women in college athletic participation. Increasing female participation in sports has had a direct effect on women's education and employment. The changes set in motion by Title IX have explained about 20 percent of the increase in women's education and about 40 percent of the rise in employment for 25-to-34-year-old women.\n\nRecently, a debate has arisen over whether college athletes should be paid. Although the earliest of star athletes were known to have received a variety of types of compensation (including endorsement fees), benefits to college athletes outside of academic scholarships have largely been prohibited under NCAA governance. \nIn the 21st century, the high, rising income paid to some colleges by the media for transmitting games to their television audiences, has led some people to complain that the athletes should share in the colleges income.\n\nThere are arguments in favor of paying athletes. A few schools benefit from owning their own networks. The University of Texas owns The Longhorn Network and Brigham Young University owns BYUtv.\n\nPaying college athletes would present several legal issues for the NCAA and its member institutions. If paid, the athletes would lose their amateur status and become university employees. As employees, these athletes would be entitled the National Labor Relations Act to form or join labor organizations and collectively bargain. Advocacy groups for college players could certify as a union given the revenue involved in college athletics.\" Collegiate sports is not a career or profession, paying college athletes would present issues under Title IX, which requires that institutions accepting federal funds offer equal opportunities to men and women.\"\n\nAbout one in ten college teams help to generate a large net amount of revenue for their school, but the athletes are not personally rewarded for their contribution. This money is spread through administrators, athletic directors, coaches, media outlets, and other parties. None is given directly to the players. Collegiate athletics entails time-consuming, intense commitment to practice and play. Only some athletic scholarships are \"full rides\", and many student-athletes are not able to afford dining, entertainment, and even some educational expenses. Outside of summertime, when work is permitted, student-athletes have no extra time for work in addition to practice, training, and classes. Paying student-athletes would give the athletes an incentive to stay in school and complete their degree programs, rather than leave early for the professional leagues. They would be much less tempted to earn money by taking illegal payments and shaving points. By not paying their athletes, colleges avoid paying workmen's-compensation benefits to the \"hundreds\" of college athletes incapacitated by injuries each year. Furthermore, if an athlete receives a serious injury while on the field, the scholarship does not pay for the bill of the surgery.\n\nColleges such as University of Connecticut (UConn), Syracuse University, and Kansas State University have some of the worst graduation rates in the country for their student-athletes. UConn had a 25% graduation rate until recently it rose to 50%. Yet, UConn still receives $1.4 million competing in the NCAA tournament, despite the low number of graduates. Paying these athletes would give some incentive to stay and finish college.\n\nIn 2013, Steve Spurrier, the head football coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks, said that all 28 men's football and basketball coaches in South Carolina's conference, the SEC, favored paying athletes up to $300 per game for football players and a little less for basketball players. It would cost the SEC about $280,000 per year.\n\nJalen Rose has a similar view to Spurrier’s, as he believes that student athletes should be given a stipend of $2500 per semester.\n\nThe College Athletes Players Association (CAPA) focuses on the idea of giving compensation to football and basketball players. The CACA has not decided if this will affect sports that do not make money for schools. The NCAA has rejected the definition of student-athletes a \"employees\".\n\nSeveral college athletes have been accused of financial improprieties, including Reggie Bush, Cam Newton, and Johnny Manziel.\n\nA USA Today article takes issue with the critics because the terms had been drawn up by the colleges:\n\nBecause of their demanding schedules, most athletes have no time to make any additional money, making it difficult to help support needy family members. In 2010 ESPN published an article about Ohio State football players that had been sanctioned by the NCAA for accepting free tattoos and selling memorabilia they had earned. However, there are many that argue that student athletes selling of personal and earned memorabilia is their right, with gray-areas where which the NCAA has a hard time justifying their punishments.\n\nAfter a number of efforts to go to trial against the NCAA's incoming revenue, a court date has been set. Former UCLA Bruin Ed O'Bannon along with Oscar Robertson and Bill Russell lead the lawsuit. The trial is scheduled to begin during the summer of 2014. Although the NCAA claims that their athletes have amateur status, the organization has made billions of dollars off of merchandise licenses. The NCAA has earned billions from broadcast revenues annually. By selling the image of their players, the NCAA is able to make money from each sport. O'Bannon has stated that some of this revenue should be spread out among the players who help bring in this cash to the NCAA. ESPN analyst Jay Bilas showed how a person could search the NCAA website by player name and have the resulting school jersey appear.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit would find that Ed O'Bannon was right in his thesis that the NCAA is taking advantage of a players image. Though the court found this ruling, all that would come of it would be that schools would only have to cover the cost of attendance. This would scrap the injunction found by U.S. District Court Judge Claudia Wilken that division one football and basketball players could receive up to five thousand dollars a year for playing. The Supreme Court would deny to hear the case on appeal, effectively stopping O'Bannon's fight.\n\nIn a 2014 court case brought by a few Northwestern University football players against the NCAA, argued that the players should be able to unionize and bargain collectively. The court ruled in the players favor. The court's decision only applied to those football players at Northwestern on a scholarship. Required football practice and playing had reduced the time students could use to pursue their studies. Former player Kain Colter argued that athletic departments should decrease the maximum number of hours a player must participate in a sport to remain part of the team and retain a\n\nscholarship. As it stands, 50 hours a week is the maximum.\n\nCollege athletes that receive a full scholarship to college already benefit from perks that the general student body does not receive. College athletes are able to take advantage of free room and board, the best dorm rooms on campus, free books and classes, and first choice of classes they want. A college athlete can receive up to $120,000 in total scholarships; they already are being paid for their participation. Adding on to the monetary argument are the opinions that student-athletes could lose focus on their educational responsibilities.\n\n\"The average fair market value of top-tier college football and men's basketball players is over $100,000 each. If college sports shared their revenues the way pro sports do, the average Football Bowl Subdivision player would be worth $121,000 per year, while the average basketball player at that level would be worth $265,000. Out of 332 schools currently competing in the NCAA Division I, fewer than a dozen have athletic departments that are making a profit. 14 of the 120 programs that comprise the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) are profitable. 88% of the top football programs in the country are losing money. Most universities are unable to pay for these athletes, along with the coaches and renovations on stadiums, out of money earned from athletics. Kenny Mossman of the University of Oklahoma (OU), estimated that the cost to OU would be $3.6 million a year if stipends were $1,000 a month.\n\nCollege athletes currently receive an enormous amount benefits when they step on campus. They are able to pick their classes before any other students. They also receive the best tutoring possible to ensure they will be eligible for their respective sport season. Many people make the argument today that they should be paid for all they do for the university. Some people also believe that they are already being paid. They are on the receiving end of more than a few benefits. Today, some schools can cost up $100,000 by the end of a students senior year. College athletes have the benefit of not having the burden of paying their college off after school. They receive one of the most important assets an individual can receive for little or no cost. The current system is working fine, and college athletes do not need to be paid.\n\n\"The NCAA also is setting up a $17 million Student-Athlete Opportunity Fund that has no financial-need restrictions. It's to be used for \"educational and developmental opportunities.\" [Nebraska Proposal, 2009]. This debate has caused certain elite colleges to take caution asking athletes to sign forms that prevent them from suing the college. The signed forms gives the college full imagery benefits, allowing them to use their names to sell team T-shirts and jerseys. Insurance wise - a plan proposed by William E. Kirwan, Ohio State University President, would insure athletes against injuries and mishaps during workouts, practices and games.\n\nBecause of title IX, all college athletes would have to be paid, including athletes playing for teams that do not produce a lot of revenue. College sponsored sports would be cut in order to make a business case for paying athletes work economically. Colleges would still be able to field \"club teams\" for those sports. \"Club team\" players almost never receive scholarships and are truly amateur athletes in every sense of the word.\n\nNon-revenue sports would suffer. Over all the sports available to division one programs, only Football and Basketball actually make a profit, with the exception of Baseball in very few instances. The rest of the sports either break even or, more often than not, cost the school more than they contribute. Larger universities would be the only ones able to pay their football/basketball players while supporting smaller market sports and are very few colleges fall into this category. The colleges that do happen to fall into this category are in five out of the 33 division one conferences. Non-revenue sports likely will be thinned out, high school athletes will lose the chance to continue competing and a larger emphasis on collegiate competition will take place within the power five conferences.\n\nFurther examples of athletes being treated like royalty at their universities can be seen through the University of Oregon. The John E. Jaqua Academic Center for the varsity athletes at the University of Oregon is a 40,000 square foot facility to assist athletes with their education. The extravagant space contains an auditorium with 114 leather seats, dozens of tutoring rooms and academic and life-skill advising offices, a computer and graphics lab, library with study spaces, lounge with large flat-screen televisions and deluxe sofas, as well as a kitchen and café filled with food and new equipment. The staff, technology, and rooms inside the academic center are all reserved for the varsity athletes, who make up 2.5% of the student population at the school. In addition, the 1,700 private tutoring sessions per week are conveniently displayed on a massive screen similar to the screens that display flight information at an airport. Adding to the exclusive treatment the student-athletes receive, the academic center is surrounded by a moat. The athletic facility adds to the royal treatment of the student-athletes. The University of Oregon's football practice facility is 145,000 square feet and contains three indoor practice fields, a two-story weight room, countless whirlpools and medical tables, enormous lockers, and luxurious lounges containing gaming stations and flat-screen televisions. Other amenities at the practice facility include a cafeteria (players receive high quality, tailored, nutritious diets), multiple conference rooms and classrooms, a pool table and barbershop. The student-athletes have luxurious facilities at their disposal, and they are already getting paid in the form of their scholarships.\n\nIf full ride scholarships to top universities is not suitable compensation for student-athletes, a college education and degree is being devalued. Student-athletes may heavily invest their time into the sport they play, however, that does not change the worth of their academic degree. Every student-athlete is not going to become a professional athlete, but they are guaranteed a college education and degree to help them graduate with little or no debt via their scholarships. If universities start paying student-athletes, the universities would not be focused on what the student-athletes are attending for, which is the education and degree they receive. An education in the long-run is very valuable, and with the scholarships the student-athletes get, they can take advantage of a great education at little to no cost.\n\nUniversities offer students more than just the education and degree they receive. Lectures by prominent industry figures, concerts, movies, fitness facilities, student clubs are a few additional benefits that universities generally subsidize through fees added to tuition bills. This means that the full-scholarship athletes can attend these activities all for free. Universities also offer unique benefits to the student-athletes such as team-only workout facilities, top coaches, nutrition personnel, shiny gyms, lush fields, medical care, travel to away games, customized meal plans, free gear, and athletic attire. The university also offers the student-athletes the opportunity to play competitive games in large stadiums packed with committed fans, which allows student-athletes to garner media attention, and name recognition.\n\nAthletes are aware of what they are committing to when they sign their full-scholarship forms. The school will be in charge of paying the student-athletes' expenses, and the student-athlete has the opportunity to earn an education, take part in academic and social activities in college, and play their sport in a high-profile manner. The best schools in certain sports naturally will attract the best recruits, as evidenced by the fact that the championships in the major sports are usually won by the same small group of schools that have dominated the sport. If paying players becomes normal, the universities that have made money from their winning teams would have an even greater advantage in attracting recruits. These universities would be able to pay players more money, thus getting the best players.\n\nTitle IX needs to be considered in the discussion regarding paying college athletes. Title IX prohibits excluding female athletes from education and financial benefit. If a university decides to pay the football team, other teams will need to be paid as well. Further, paying college football players will result in universities entering heated bidding wars while they are attracting recruits.\n\nMark Emmert, NCAA president is opposed to paying college athletes because it would encourage universities to bribe athletes. Emmert believes that if student-athletes were paid to play, there would be more pressure on boosters and agents to bribe student-athletes to play for a certain university and to financially support them while they are playing at the university. Emmert stands by the ideals that student-athletes are students first, and he backs up this ideal by noting student-athletes' graduation rate across all demographics is greater than the non-athletes. Emmert also stands behind the ideal that the money student-athletes receive through their scholarships is equal or greater than payments the proponents of pay-for-play advocate for.\n\nDue to the NCAA restrictions on compensation, college athletes cannot personally license their likenesses to third-parties for commercial gains. In 2010, A.J. Green was suspended for four games by the NCAA for having sold a game-worn jersey from a bowl game to a former college player, whom the NCAA defined as an agent involved in marketing student-athletes. At the same time, however, the University of Georgia sold replica jerseys bearing Green's number for its own financial gain, and did not compensate him. A journal published by the University of La Verne Law Review argued that the NCAA was exploiting college athletes by not allowing them to receive compensation beyond scholarships for their participation in collegiate sports, and allowing schools to profit from merchandise associated with players, but not the players themselves. Furthermore, it was noted that television outlets pay conferences large sums of money for the rights to broadcast the events, which prominently feature the likenesses of players, yet the revenue from these rights fees cannot go to players.\n\nThe NCAA had also been accused of suppressing financial compensation to players for future uses of likenesses after they graduate. In 2009, retired basketball player Ed O'Bannon sued the NCAA, the Collegiate Licensing Company, and Electronic Arts on behalf of Division I basketball and football players. Among other examples, such as a lack of residuals for the broadcast of encores of games that featured him, O'Bannon cited that an EA Sports \"NCAA March Madness\" video game had featured a portrayal of himself as a member of UCLA's 1995 championship team. As with all other players in EA's college sports games, the game did not refer to O'Bannon by name, but the portrayal matched his jersey number, physical appearance, and style of play. The NCAA objected to the notions presented in the suit, arguing that paying athletes conflicted with its policies of amateurism in sport.\n\nEA and the CLC agreed to a $40 million settlement. After the NCAA and other conferences withdrew their brand licenses with EA in response to the uncertainties, the company subsequently ceased the production of future college sports video games. A judge ruled that the NCAA's policies on non-compensation of athletes were a violation of antitrust law, and argued that universities should be able to cover the costs of athletes attending, and provide a trust fund of at least $5,000 per-season to athletes. It was argued that the NCAA \"[did] not provide credible evidence that demand for [its] product would decrease if student-athletes were permitted, under certain circumstances, to receive a limited share of the revenue generated from the use of their own names, images, and likenesses.\"\n\nEvery year, the United States Military Academy (Army) Black Knights face the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) Paladins in the annual West Point Weekend ice hockey game. This series, conceived in 1923, is claimed as the longest-running uninterrupted annual international intercollegiate sporting event in the world.\n"}
{"id": "2181538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181538", "title": "Reed Sorenson", "text": "Reed Sorenson\n\nBradley \"Reed\" Sorenson (born February 5, 1986) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He currently competes part-time in the NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 27 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 1LE for Premium Motorsports and the No. 77 Camaro for Spire Motorsports.\n\nSorenson's career started at age six when he began racing quarter-midgets. He won the national championship in 1997. He moved up to legends cars the following year, winning 13 out of 25 races, southeastern championships and breaking track records in the process. In 1999 he won 30 out of the 50 races in which he competed. He raced in legends for the next two years and won 84 events.\n\nIn 2002, Sorenson began racing in the American Speed Association (ASA), finishing in the top-ten seven out of his eight starts. He became a full-time driver in 2003 and won the highly coveted ASA Pat Schauer Memorial Rookies of the Year award at age 17. He caught his big break by signing a driver development contract with Chip Ganassi Racing.\n\nIn 2004, he won his first ARCA race, at Michigan International Speedway, in the No. 77 Sherwin-Williams Dodge. He finished in the top-five in all three of his ARCA starts Sorenson also ran in five NASCAR Busch Series events for Chip Ganassi Racing, and had three top ten finishes, and a top five, which was a fourth-place finish at Homestead.\n\nSorenson was named the full-time driver of the No. 41 Discount Tire Company-sponsored Dodge Intrepid for Ganassi for 2005, competing for rookie of the year. He won his first Busch Series race, at Nashville Superspeedway, winning by more than 14 seconds after starting on the pole and leading 197 out of 225 laps. After the Federated Auto Parts 300, he was leading the points race by 51. Sorenson picked up another win at Gateway. He ended the season fourth in points and finished second in the rookie of the year race to Carl Edwards.\n\nTowards the end of the season, he was signed to move up to the Nextel Cup Series to drive the No. 41 Target-sponsored car full-time. He made his Nextel Cup debut in the 2005 Bass Pro Shops MBNA 500, racing as No. 39, but was involved in a crash and finished 41st. After a failed attempt to qualify for the Dickies 500, he ran in the Ford 400 for Phoenix Racing, where he finished the race in 28th.\n\n2006 brought on Sorenson's first season as a Nextel Cup Series regular, along with running a full-time driver in the Busch Series. His best finish in the 2006 Nextel Cup season was a fifth-place effort at Michigan International Speedway, and he ended the season with five top-ten finishes. He finished 24th in the 2006 points Nextel Cup standings and was fourth in the 2006 Raybestos Rookie of the Year contest with 198 points finishing behind Denny Hamlin, Martin Truex, Jr., and Clint Bowyer. He also fell in the Busch Series, dropping from fourth in the standings as a 19-year-old the year before to 10th place in 2006.\n\nSorenson broke his 61-race winless streak in the Busch Series at Gateway International Speedway by leading 95 laps and avoiding late race cautions to win the Busch Gateway 250 in Madison, Illinois. In Cup, he had a career best finish of fourth, at the Coca-Cola 600, and later a third-place finish at his home track at Atlanta. Sorenson got his first career pole, at the Allstate 400. Sorenson became the youngest pole winner ever at Indianapolis Motor Speedway; at 21 years, 173 days old. He broke a record that stood for 72 years. It was previously held by Rex Mays, who won the pole for the Indianapolis 500 in 1935 at 22 years of age. Sorenson ended up leading 16 laps, and finishing in the fifth place, behind race winner, Tony Stewart. At the end of the 2007 season, he placed 22nd in the final standings, improving two spots from 2006 (although he actually scored fewer points than in his rookie season).\nSorenson started the 2008 season off with a fifth-place finish in the Daytona 500. This was the peak of his performances for the season. He got another top ten finish with some late race strategy in a rain shortened New Hampshire race. He was temporarily replaced by Scott Pruett at Infineon Raceway in an attempt to gain points in the owners' standings. Sorenson ran a limited 2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series competing in the Aaron's 312 at Talladega Superspeedway in the Fitz Motorsports No. 22 Arctic Ice-sponsored car.\n\nSorenson competed in the Missouri-Illinois Dodge Dealers 250 at Gateway International Raceway to defend his win from 2007, in the No. 40 Fastenal Chip Ganassi Racing Dodge. He was involved in a mid-race wreck that ended his chance to defend his title. On August 26, 2008, it was announced that the 2008 season was to be Sorenson's last season with Ganassi, after signing a multi year contract with Gillett Evernham Motorsports to start the 2009 season. He ended the year 32nd in points.\n\nOn January 8, 2009, Gillett Evernham Motorsports and Petty Holdings announced in principle to form a new NASCAR Sprint Cup team that will be co-owned by Richard Petty, Petty Holdings (owned by majority shareholder Boston Ventures), and Gillett Evernham Motorsports. The new car number will be No. 43 and will be driven by Sorenson. It was announced on January 19, 2009, that with the merger of Gillett Evernham Motorsports and Petty Holdings the newly formed team will be known as Richard Petty Motorsports.\n\nSorenson's 2009 season was wildly disappointing; he had only one top 10 (at the season-opening Daytona 500) and finished 29th in the season standings. On September 10, 2009, Richard Petty Motorsports and Yates Racing announced that they planned to merge in 2010, and Sorenson was not to be retained as part of the merger. A. J. Allmendinger took over the No. 43 following the season.\n\nSorenson piloted the No. 32 Braun Racing Toyota Camry in a part-time schedule consisting of 23 Nationwide races for 2010. He was to share the ride with Brian Vickers, but after Vickers was diagnosed with blood clots in May and cannot race, Sorenson is to take over for the rest of Vickers' planned Nationwide starts. In mid-January, Braun Racing announced that Sorenson will drive a part-time Sprint Cup Series schedule. After failing to qualify for the Daytona 500, the team announced they will attempt the Kobalt Tools 500 in Atlanta, but decided to rather attempt the Samsung Mobile 500 in Texas, where Sorenson qualified 43rd and finished 39th. On June 16, Sorenson was hired by Team Red Bull as a substitute driver for car No. 83 and driver Brian Vickers. At the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona, Sorenson drove the No. 83 car to an eighth-place finish. It was the first top 10 for the team since Vickers was sidelined.\n\nPrior to the 2011 season, Braun Racing was acquired by Turner Motorsports and the team switched manufacturers from Toyota to Chevrolet. Sorenson remained with the team to run full-time for the Nationwide Series championship. He drove the No. 32 Dollar General Chevy and the No. 30 Rexall Chevy on occasions. He won his first road course race at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin on his first attempt at the track. This was his first win since 2007.\n\nOn October 4, Turner Motorsports announced that Sorenson would no longer be driving the No. 32 Dollar General Chevy, and Brian Vickers would be assuming the driving duties immediately. Turner Motorsports gave no reason for the switch; and Sorenson was third in points at the time. Turner did acknowledge that Dollar General would not sponsor their car after 2011. Sorenson managed to pick up a last-minute ride with MacDonald Motorsports to drive their No. 82 car for the remainder of the year.\n\nIn 2012, Sorenson drove the No. 52 Chevrolet for Jimmy Means in the season-opening Nationwide Series event at Daytona International Speedway. At Bristol Motor Speedway and California Speedway in March, Sorenson drove the No. 74 for Turn One Racing in the Sprint Cup Series.\n\nSorenson made his debut in the No. 32 team owned by Frank Stoddard for the night race at Texas Motor Speedway with sponsor from Jani-king.\n\nSorensen drove the No. 32 for FAS Lane Racing in select races for the 2012 Sprint Cup Season. Later in the year he attempted to qualify for the Brickyard 400 driving the No. 91 Ford for Humphrey Smith Racing, but failed to qualify for the race. He qualified for the Pennsylvania 400 the following week, making his first race in the No. 91, which had changed to Toyota.\n\nIn February 2013, it was announced that Sorenson would drive full-time in the Nationwide Series in the No. 40 Chevrolet for The Motorsports Group. Following an injury to Michael Annett, Sorenson substituted for Annett in the Richard Petty Motorsports No. 43 Ford for several races.\n\nIn September, Sorenson returned to the Sprint Cup Series, replacing Scott Speed in the No. 95 Ford for Leavine Family Racing. However, he failed to secure the seat for 2014, with Leavine instead picking Michael McDowell to drive the car.\n\nIn February 2014, Sorenson announced that he would be running his first full Sprint Cup Series schedule since 2009, driving the No. 36 Chevrolet for Tommy Baldwin Racing, replacing J. J. Yeley. Veteran crew chief Todd Parrott was brought in to work with Sorenson. After struggling with limited sponsorship in the beginning of the year, the team came around during the second half of the season with additional sponsorship, recording 5 top 25s and 10 top 30s in the final 16 events of the season, with a high of 14th at Talladega. The team finished with an average finish of 29th.\n\nOn February 9, 2015, Sorenson was signed by Team Xtreme Racing to compete in the Daytona 500 with sponsorship from Golden Corral, driving the No. 44 Chevy. Sorenson joined RAB Racing for the following race at Atlanta. He was also signed with Premium Motorsports after lack of sponsorship killed both of his prior teams.\n\nSorenson attempted to make his Camping World Truck Series debut at Daytona, driving the No. 63 for MB Motorsports. Sorenson also joined Hillman Racing for the Daytona 500, driving the No. 40 Chevrolet but didn't qualify. Sorenson missed both events. Sorenson returned to Premium Motorsports, driving the No. 55 Chevrolet starting at Martinsville. Sorenson later made his Camping World Truck Series debut at Pocono, driving the No. 49 Chevrolet Silverado for Premium Motorsports where he finished 18th.\n\nSorenson returned to Premium for the 2017 season. He failed to qualify after being (possibly) intentionally wrecked by Corey LaJoie in Can-Am Duel 1. After the race, Sorenson called the move \"pretty crappy\" and \"moronic\" and added on that LaJoie, making his first Daytona laps during the Duel, could've hurt someone, drawing comparisons to Kyle Busch's 2015 Daytona wreck, after which he missed 11 races.\n\nAfter flagship driver Michael Waltrip announced that he would retire from NASCAR competition after the 2017 Daytona 500, Premium Motorsports announced that Sorenson would drive the No. 15 Toyota for the rest of the 2017 season, following Robinson's purchase of HScott Motorsports' No. 15 Chevrolet. However, Premium removed Sorenson from the 15 for Dover, replacing him with Ross Chastain. No announcements have yet been made about who will drive the 15 for the remainder of the season. Although he did run Pocono and Michigan, he was replaced again by Kevin O'Connell at Sonoma, and D. J. Kennington at Daytona he then returned to the No. 15 until he was again replaced, this time by Gray Gaulding at Pocono. He bounced around the No. 15 and No. 55 entry's for the rest of the year.\n\nSorenson drove mainly the No. 7 and No. 55 entries for Premium Motorsports throughout the year, with also driving the Bristol night race in Rick Ware Racing’s No. 51 entry. He qualified for Ross Chastain at the Michigan August race in the No. 15 when Chastain was in Mid-Ohio for the Xfinity race.\n\nIn March, Sorenson joined Spire Motorsports' No. 77 for the Pennzoil 400 at Las Vegas. Throughout the 2019 season, he split the ride with various other drivers and also raced for Premium in the No. 27.\n\nSorenson returned to Premium's No. 27 for the 2020 Daytona 500. He made the starting lineup after finishing 18th in Duel 1 of the 2020 Bluegreen Vacations Duels.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n"}

Mr. Bowen's mission includes ensuring effective oversight of the $63 billion appropriated for Iraq's relief and reconstruction.\n\nBorn in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 1958, Mr. Bowen attended the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia, earned a B.A. from the University of the South/Sewanee, attended Vanderbilt University Law School, and received a J.D. from St. Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio, where he served on the Law Journal's Editorial Board. He spent four years on active duty as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force, earning the rank of Captain and the Air Force Commendation Medal. From 1991 to 1992, Mr. Bowen was Briefing Attorney to Texas Supreme Court Justice Raul Gonzalez; and from 1992 to 1994, he was an Assistant Attorney General of Texas, with a litigation practice focused on the civil prosecution of state licensee regulatory violations and appellate work in state and federal court.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2000, Mr. Bowen held a variety of positions on Texas Governor George W. Bush's staff, including Deputy General Counsel, Deputy General Counsel for Litigation, and Assistant General Counsel. He was part of President Bush's legal team handling the post-election litigation in Florida during November–December 2000; his work helped ensure that overseas military ballots were properly counted. Mr. Bowen subsequently served as Counsel to the Bush-Cheney transition team.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Mr. Bowen served President Bush as Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Staff Secretary and Special Assistant to the President and Associate Counsel. In 2003, he became a partner at the law firm of Patton Boggs LLP, working out of its Washington, D.C. office.\n\nAs \"Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction\", Mr. Bowen is tasked with auditing and investigating the use of taxpayer funds appropriated for the Iraq reconstruction effort. Since 2004, he has managed the production of 390 audits and inspections, producing financial benefits in excess of $1.5 billion; his investigations have yielded over 83 convictions, with recoveries in excess of $192 million via forfeiture orders, fines, and seizures.\n\nMr. Bowen has supervised the production of 35 quarterly reports to the Congress, travelled to Iraq 34 times, and testified before the Congress on 35 occasions.

On March 24, 2008, a rocket impacted the Embassy grounds killing Paul Converse, a SIGIR auditor. Paul was posthumously awarded the Jefferson Star by the State Department, its highest honor. Five other SIGIR staff members have been wounded while serving in Iraq.\n\nIn January 2015, Texas Governor Greg Abbott named Bowen as the Inspector General for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The appointment is subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nBrought in as an outsider to clean up a contracting scandal, Bowen also had to contend with hundreds of millions of questionable fraud allegations made by his predecessor. By September he had settled cases totaling $9 million. In addition, Bowen faced repairing ties with the Medicaid provider community and with HHSC. As Inspector General, Bowen is charged with preventing, detecting, and deterring fraud, waste, and abuse in the Texas Health and Human Services System. \nOn October 22, 2015, Bowen accused Planned Parenthood of misconduct and informed them all of the state's Planned Parenthood affiliates were being dropped as a Medicaid health care provider. He cited videos showing misconduct and sent investigators with letters to Planned Parenthood offices in San Antonio, Dallas, and the Houston area, requesting records. His letters cited the authority of Health and Human Services Commission to investigate allegations of potential fraud involving Medicaid payments.\n\nBowen was forced to resign by Gov. Greg Abbott on May 10, 2017, after the governor discovered Bowen had been moonlighting for Hyatt Farber Schreck, a lobbying firm that represents the Iraqi government.\nBowen said he had consulted with a state ethics advisor and was told that his moonlighting \"fully complied\" with the health commission's policy. However, the health agency's policies explicitly bar employees from having an \"economic or monetary interest in a lobbying firm\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2181578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181578", "title": "Arizona State Capitol", "text": "Arizona State Capitol\n\nThe Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, was the last home for Arizona's Territorial government, until Arizona became a state in 1912. Initially, all three branches of the new state government occupied the four floors of the statehouse. As the state expanded the branches relocated to adjacent buildings and additions. The 1901 portion of the Capitol is now maintained as the Arizona Capitol Museum with a focus on the history and culture of Arizona. The Arizona State Library which occupied most of the 1938 addition until July 2017 re-opened in late 2018 as a part of the Arizona Capitol Museum. \n\nMuseum exhibits, events, and programs focus on the evolution of Arizona from Territory to State. The \"Arizona Takes Shape\" exhibit provides school-age visitors curriculum-related information for \"Arizona State History\" and \"government\" studies\".\" The museum has over 20 exhibits featuring contemporary, historical and artifacts from the Arizona state-owned collections. Permanent exhibits include the sinking of USS \"Arizona\", the formal silver service from USS \"Arizona\", a timeline of events pivotal in making Arizona a state, the Governor and Secretary of State's original offices, the historical senate, and house. \n\nVisitors can enter the Historic House Chamber where the people can sit at the desks. There is also a room dedicated to the 140 changes in the Arizona Constitution over 100 years of statehood. The Governor's office on the second includes artifacts from several of Arizona's governors as well as a flag used by Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders.\n\nOne impressive display shows the enormous silver and copper punchbowl service from , as well as a bronze sculpture that was ensconced outside the Admiral's stateroom and used as a centerpiece at state dinners wherever USS \"Arizona\" was docked. Both of these historical artifacts survived the sinking of \"Arizona\" because they had been removed from the ship for cleaning prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The punchbowl service is the only one of its kind and is composed of etched copper panels depicting desert scenes set into a silver bowl ornamented with mermaids, dolphins, waves, and other nautical themes.\n\nOf particular interest is the display of a collection of gifts received by Arizona as part of the \"Merci Train\" sent by France to the United States following World War II. The French wanted to thank America for sending the \"Friendship Train\": 250 railroad cars full of fuel, oil, and food in 1948 during a time that the European countries were devastated by World War II. Tens of thousands of French citizens donated objects to be sent to the United States and it was decided that because the outpouring of goods was so great, one boxcar would be sent to each state with one being shared between the District of Columbia and the Territory of Hawaii. All of the items were to be loaded in \"Forty and Eight\"-type boxcars, named after the sign painted on them which stated that 40 men or 8 horses could be loaded inside. Each car was to be adorned with the coats of arms of all of the provinces of France. The capitol building displays work by the noted Arizona artist Lon Megargee.\n\nThe museum is launching a rental program for private rental. For the first time in history, this historic building will be the backdrop for receptions, business dinners, and weddings.\n\nThe building was created as part of an effort to demonstrate that the Arizona Territory was ready for statehood. A design contest was won by James Riely Gordon, whose original plan called for the Capitol to be much larger, with a more prominent rotunda and large wings for both houses of the legislature on each side of the current building. Funding deficits meant the project had to be reduced, so the legislative wings were discarded from the plan and a small lead-alloy top substituted for Gordon's decorative dome.\n\nConstruction of the Capitol began in 1898, and it began operation in 1901. In 1918 and 1938, expansions were added on the west side of the building, which had the same architecture and increased the total square footage from the original 40,000 to a final 123,000. It was home to the Legislature until 1960, when the current house and senate buildings were constructed, and the Governor's Office until 1974, when the executive tower was built. The state at that time had a plan of converting the original Capitol into a museum dedicated to Arizona's history. The original opening of the Arizona Capitol Museum was announced by Governor Bruce Babbitt at his inauguration in 1978 and hosted over 40,000 schoolchildren in that first year in 1979. After a restoration, the building was re-opened as a museum in 1981. In the 1990s, more than $3 million was spent to renovate the Capitol and rooms were restored to their original design. Again, due to budget deficits, construction was stopped on a few rooms on the third floor and they remain incomplete. The Capitol is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nOn January 14, 2010, the Arizona State Department of Administration reported that it had sold the surrounding state buildings to private investors: the tower, the two flanking legislative buildings, and other state structures. The Old Capitol was not part of this transaction.\n\nThe building is made largely from materials indigenous to Arizona, including malapai, granite, and the copper dome. The design is optimized for the desert climate of Arizona, with thick masonry walls that insulate the interior, skylights, and round \"bullseye\" clerestory windows to let heat out of the legislative chambers. The building is topped with a weather vane similar to the Winged Victory of Samothrace, visible through a skylight from within the rotunda.\n\nAs Arizona's population has grown, the Capitol complex itself has become increasingly crowded. The Senate and House buildings, opened in 1960, have been deteriorating. The Senate, in particular, is prone to constant plumbing problems, and occasionally a broken pipe floods the entire building. The Capitol itself is now used exclusively as a museum, and serves over 70,000 visitors each year, including more than 50,000 school children. In the past complaints had been made that the site was not pleasing aesthetically, and compare the Senate and House buildings as oversized \"bunkers\" which eclipse the beauty of the Capitol. A task force appointed by the state legislature in 2007 reported that the complex is \"barely\" adequate to suit the state's current needs and \"wholly\" inadequate to suit the state's future needs. As a result, proposals were made in 2008 to renovate or rebuild the Capitol site, to a grander site, as well as a site that will serve the needs of the government more adequately. To date, keeping the integrity of the 1901 building in original condition, including the \"cramped\" spaces occupied by some of the Senate and the House staff have been the main focus for the Capitol Museum administrator and staff. The building's original usage is part of the state history.\n\nProposals for relocating some office and meeting space back into the Capitol included the House and Senate buildings undergo either a drastic rebuilding and expansion or a complete demolition and construction of new facilities for the House and Senate. A past Arizona State University study planned a comprehensive redesign for the entire Capitol mall and complex.\n\n\n"}

It is in service with the Chilean armed forces and police and is exported.\n\nThe SAF is a blowback-operated select-fire gun, firing from a closed bolt. It is based on the Swiss SIG SG 540 assault rifle which was produced under license in Chile in the 1980s. In general the design is a shortened version of the SIG 540 rifle, but the rifle's rotating bolt has been replaced with a simple blowback bolt. The SAF also has a bolt hold-open catch that engages after the final shot. Otherwise, the receiver, stock, fore-end, trigger/hammer assembly and floating firing pin design are from the SIG 540.\n\nThe upper and lower receiver, as well as the trigger guard are steel, pistol grip and Handguards are all made from polymer. The ambidextrous safety/fire selector switch, as well as the interchangeability with SIG 552/553 handguards, is a feature found on the latest versions. Older versions used its own handguards.\n\nThe 9mm magazines are transparent plastic, allowing the number of available rounds to be determined visually. The magazine is fitted with protruding lugs on one side and corresponding slots on the other, allowing two or three magazines to be clipped together for faster magazine changes. The .40S&W magazines are steel and hold 30 rounds.\n\nThe selector has four settings: safe, single shot, 3-round burst and fully automatic. Some models were made in a semi-auto only configuration.\n\nThe SAF is manufactured in four versions: the standard model with a fixed polymer buttstock, standard with a left-side-folding tubular metal buttstock, a model with an integral suppressor and folding buttstock, and the Mini-SAF.\n\nThe Mini-SAF is very compact, at only long. It has a short barrel, no shoulder stock (although the left-side-folding tubular metal buttstock of the standard SAF can be attached), and a vertical foregrip. The Mini-SAF can use the standard 30-round magazines, but comes with special 20-round magazines for a smaller profile. All versions have post front sights with adjustable elevation, and aperture rear sights, adjustable for windage.\nA new version, the SAF-200 Bicentenary Edition, is being tested by FAMAE and the Chilean Army. It includes a new, retractable and foldable stock, a new handguard and Picatinny rails provided for optics and lateral attachments. The rails are optional for other SAF models, but standard on the SAF-200.\n\n\n"}

The game was released in Japan by Marvelous Interactive on August 25, 2005, and later available in North America by Ubisoft on September 27, 2005, and a European version on February 17, 2006 by Rising Star Games. As the first original \"Lunar\" series title in ten years, it was also the first traditional role-playing game available for the Nintendo DS, utilizing several new features such as combat taking place across of two screens and the use of the system's built-in microphone to issue commands.\n\nThe game takes place a thousand years before the events of the first \"Lunar\" game, \"\", and centers on Jian Campbell, a young delivery boy and adventurer who must save the world from the rising menace of the Vile Tribe, a race of powerful magicians who wish to gain control of the goddess Althena and take over the world. Largely panned by critics, the game has received negative reviews due to a number of gameplay additions often seen as tedious and debilitating, such as the inability to target specific enemies in combat, as well as the decision to not include series mainstays such as voice acting and full-motion video sequences.\n\n\"Lunar: Dragon Song\" is a traditional two-dimensional role-playing video game with an overhead, isometric viewpoint. Players may move the game's characters in eight directions using the Nintendo DS D-pad or stylus across of a number of different environments and completing story-based objects to move the plot forward. The game includes several differences to other games in the \"Lunar\" series, including a simplified world map that allows players to instantly travel to adjacent locations, and a condensed menu accessible from the bottom screen. A card collection system first seen in \"\" is expanded to allow the cards to be used for beneficial effects, such as granting special abilities and changing game mechanics. Using the Nintendo DS wireless connection, two players can participate in a multiplayer match using cards obtained through normal gameplay called Scratch Battle. By scratching off sections of each card, a player can \"damage\" their opponent by revealing numbers on its surface.\n\nUnlike previous \"Lunar\" games that took a strategy-based approach to combat, \"Lunar: Dragon Song\" relies on a strictly traditional turn-based system where the player inputs commands at the start of each combat round with the appropriate actions taking place in accordance with a character's speed. While a player may freely select any character to use items or supportive magic on, specific enemies cannot be targeted by attacks, with the character artificial intelligence instead choosing the target itself. Game producer and Japan Art Media president Mitsuru Takahashi stated that the game's battle system was made intentionally simplistic to \"speed up\" combat sequences, as well as streamline the battling process. A player's party may consist of no more than three characters, each of which are switched in or out automatically at certain points throughout the story, with no way to actively switch between them. Before going into battle, a player may choose one of two different modes: Combat and Virtue. Virtue Mode allows a player to earn experience points known as \"Althena Conduct\" after winning a battle which go towards gaining levels which grant characters increased statistics and new skills. Combat Mode instead yields items.\n\nThe principal characters are Jian Campbell and his companions, a group of young adventurers who are caught up in a quest to save the world from the rising menace of the Vile Tribe. Jian himself is a headstrong delivery boy for Gad's Delivery who must often travel through monster infested lands to make his runs, and has trained himself in hand-to-hand combat accordingly. Lucia Collins is a kind-hearted yet bossy young girl who works with Jian, and has a natural gift for healing magic. Gabryel Ryan is a free-thinking young beast-woman who believes humans and beastmen should be considered equals, and fights with a combination of martial arts and magic dances. Flora Banks is a skilled marksman and healer who lives with her brother on the outskirts of the Frontier, a barren place that resembles the world of Lunar before the Goddesses' intervention. Rufus Crow is an adolescent Beastman and general of his nation's army who develops a rivalry with Jian after their first encounter, yet sees him as an ally soon after.\n\nPrimary supporting characters include Gad, manager and owner of Gad's Delivery Service where Jian and Lucia are employed, and Zethos, leader of the Beastmen and one of the world's strongest fighters who follows the old doctrine that his people are superior. The primary antagonist is Ignatius, member of the villainous Vile Tribe and expert magician who seeks to covet the power of the Goddess for himself. \"Lunar: Dragon Song\" is the first game in the series to not have Toshiyuki Kubooka as lead character designer, but rather as a design supervisor who made final decisions on each character's appearance and maintain a \n\"distinct Lunar feel\".\n\nThe game takes place 1000 years before \"\", making it the first game chronologically. The game opens with an explanation of the Lunar lore and how the Goddess Althena created a habitable place out of a barren wasteland and sent four powerful dragons to protect it. During the time of this game, Humans and Beastmen are still at odds with one another, and live in opposing towns across the world. The game stars a delivery boy named Jian Campbell who works in the busy port town of Searis delivering parcels and packages to anyone he is assigned. His best friend and partner, Lucia, often joins him in his excursions and helps him defeat monsters that litter the land. Along their journey, they get caught up in the legend of the dragons and, eventually, must put an end to an evil Dragonmaster who seeks to use their power to rule the world.\n\n\"Lunar: Dragon Song\" experienced low sales during its original release in Japan, selling only 24,673 copies in the region. The game received a 27 out of 40 score from Japanese \"Famitsu Weekly\" magazine, whose editors found parts of the game to be \"bothersome and stressful\" such as losing health while dashing and having players choose either experience points or items as a battle reward, but also remarked that the game was \"designed for people who are moved by an excellent storyline and characterization.\"\n\nCritical reaction to the game's English version was similarly lukewarm, with the game receiving largely low to average reviews. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" panned the title's unorthodox gameplay both in and out of battle, claiming that \"When its fundamentals are botched this badly, not even \"Dragon Song\"'s semidecent story can save it.\" \"Game Informer\" similarly described the game as an \"unfun and almost unplayable nightmare of gameplay design missteps\", with the magazine later ranking the game eighth on its list of the \"10 Worst Games of 2005\" year-end review. IGN conversely felt that the game was an average handheld role-playing game, but that it contained many flaws that would require \"patience and an abundance of free time\" to overcome, stating that \"Lunar is not a bad game by any means ... [it] features a bundle of original ideas, but fails to implement them in a fashion that stays entertaining throughout the course of the game.\" 1UP.com similarly called it \"a better-than-average handheld RPG with a likable cast, a charming story, and appealing graphics\", but found it inferior in presentation to earlier \"Lunar\" titles, finding that it \"isn't really up to the thrilling and dramatic heights the series was synonymous.\" GameSpot felt that many of the game's features lacked cohesion, remarking that it felt \"convoluted where you want it to be simple, and shallow where you wish it had some depth\" adding that \"Even the most devout Lunar loyalists will have a hard time enjoying this game.\"\n\nIn an import review of the North American version, Eurogamer ultimately declared that \"\"Lunar: Dragon Song\" could, should and would have been the DS's first great JRPG, especially considering its lineage, but, rather, what we have here is a wasted opportunity; one that turns your anger to frustration then to plain, empty sadness,\" calling the game's battle system \"comfortably the worst in 20 years of RPGs.\" The game maintains a 58.19% average score from aggregate review website GameRankings based on 40 reviews, and a 59/100 score from Metacritic based on 30 reviews.\n"}

He is ranked 8th dan in the Aikikai. He is chief instructor at the dojo New York Aikikai,and President of the United States Aikido Federation(USAF).\n\nOriginally from Tokyo, Japan, Yamada became interested in aikido through his father's cousin, Tadashi Abe, who trained at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. He entered Hombu Dojo as an uchi deshi in 1955 at the age of 17. His exposure to westerners and ability to speak English made him a natural choice to teach to American soldiers. He first came to the United States in 1964 to do an aikido demonstration at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. In 1966 Yamada and his family hosted Virginia Mayhew, an aikido practitioner from New York. Although the original New York Aikikai was founded in 1961 and led by Yasuo Ohara, when Yamada moved to New York he assumed control and moved the dojo from its 18th Street local to its present location.\n\nIn those days there was no other aikido teacher (with the exception of the original NY Aikikai founder Yasuo Ohara) from Japan on the east coast of the US, and Yamada would travel weekly to Boston, with frequent trips to Philadelphia and points south as well. In 1966 some of the burden was relieved when he invited Mitsunari Kanai to take over the small group in Boston. Over time Yamada's students have grown to have students of their own, and have risen to ranks as high as 7th dan. In 1988 Yamada invited Seiichi Sugano to join the dojo, making it one of the few dojo outside Japan with two 8th dan shihan in residence. In 2004 the New York Aikikai celebrated its 40th anniversary with a summer camp at Colgate University with many shihan and Doshu Moriteru Ueshiba in attendance. Yamada continues to keep an active teaching and travelling schedule, holding seminars in the US as well as Latin America, Russia, France, Germany and other points around the world. In France, he teaches at the summer seminar at La Colle-sur-Loup which was organized by his senpai, Nobuyoshi Tamura, and at the summer seminar in Lesneven; both seminars also feature . In Germany, Yamada teaches a summer seminar at Bernau am Chiemsee.\n\nYamada is well known for his clear and strong basic technique. Beyond his technical ability, he also possesses a gift for passing on his knowledge. His students have become some of the most well-known and high-ranking aikidoka in the Americas. He teaches seminars all over the world where thousands of students attend his classes. He was a direct student of the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, for more than ten years.\n\nYamada is president of the United States Aikido Federation and chairman of the Latin America Aikido Federation. In January 2011, Yamada accepted an invitation to become the patron of Aikikai Australia. He is the author of the book \"Aikido Complete\", and has made multiple aikido training tapes, including the \"Power and the Basics\" series, which outlines the requirements for rank testing of all levels.\n\nWith the deaths of his colleagues Akira Tohei in 1999, Mitsunari Kanai in 2004, and Seiichi Sugano and Nobuyoshi Tamura in 2010, Yamada is one of the most senior living representatives of the last generation of direct students of Morihei Ueshiba.\n\nIn February 2010 Yoshimitsu Yamada founded Aikido Sansuikai International during a seminar in Dominican Republic. Aikido Sansuikai International is an organization recognized by Aikikai Hombu Dojo and has affiliated dojos from Latin America and Europe.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the fourth episode of the and is directed by castmember René Auberjonois (Constable Odo). This is focused on O'Brien and Bashir on an away mission on a \"Danube\"-class runabout that crash-lands on an exoplanet, which provides a platform to explore the interaction between the ethics of soldier and medicine among other topics.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nMiles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) crash-land their runabout on a planet that is home to several rogue Jem'Hadar. Their leader, Goran'Agar (Scott MacDonald), takes the two captive and asks Bashir to help cure his men of their addiction to ketracel-white, the drug that makes them loyal to the Founders of the Dominion. Goran'Agar has not needed the drug since he was stranded on the planet four years prior; he has concluded that there must be some substance on the planet that cured him of his addiction.\n\nBashir and O'Brien devise a plan to escape, but O'Brien's makeshift weapon is discovered. However, Bashir notes that Goran'Agar shows unusual mercy, and his conversations seem to indicate independence of thought and character. He decides he wants to aid Goran'Agar and his men, but O'Brien is convinced the Jem'Hadar will always be brutal killers regardless of whether they are dependent on the drug or not. Bashir eventually orders O'Brien to help him develop a cure by retrieving a piece of equipment from the runabout. \n\nAt the runabout, O'Brien escapes his guard. Meanwhile, Bashir concludes that there is nothing special about the planet that cured Goran'Agar of his addiction; through some biological fluke, he was never addicted in the first place. O'Brien finds Bashir, and when Bashir refuses to leave with him, O'Brien sabotages his work. Goran'Agar confronts them, but his merciful ways have lost him the loyalty of his men, and with no hope of a cure, he finds he has no reason to kill O'Brien and Bashir. He leads them to their runabout and asks O'Brien, a former soldier, to explain to Bashir why he cannot abandon his men, even if they would kill him if he stayed. On their way back to Deep Space Nine, O'Brien tries to explain to Bashir that all his efforts were intended to save him.\n\nIn a side plot, Lt. Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) acclimates to living on DS9 and no longer being Chief of Security. He finds Quark dealing with a smuggler, and, frustrated by Constable Odo's apparent refusal to arrest the two, confronts them himself. Odo appears and explains to Worf that he wanted the deal to go ahead so that he could track the smuggler and break down the entire smuggling ring, but Worf's interference has made that impossible. Captain Sisko explains to Worf that life on Deep Space Nine has many grey areas that will take some getting used to.\n\n\n"}

The area was the wealthiest part of the city and was mainly inhabited by \"well to do\" business families and contained large detached houses. It was Glasgow's equivalent of Kensington and Chelsea in London. However, when Labour won the general election in 1964, Glasgow had a lot of slum clearance and a lot of council housing was built in the Cathcart area, and areas which had previously been fields now housed the families from the old slums. These families naturally voted Labour and time and time, again the Conservative majorities dwindled. In 1966, the Conservative majority fell to a record low of 1,200 votes.\n\nIn 1970, the Conservatives increased their majority to around 5,000 but at the next two general elections in 1974 it soon fell again. In 1979, when Margaret Thatcher took office, the Conservatives lost the seat to Labour, against the national trend where there was a large swing to the Conservatives. After redrawn boundaries were made in 1983, the seat was notionally Conservative but like 1979 the seat went against the national trend and the Labour MP increased his majority. From 1983-97, the Conservatives lost more ground time after time except for a small improvement in 1992 (inline with the national trend in Scotland, which ran counter to that across the United Kingdom). In 1997, Labour won a landslide victory in which the Conservatives lost all their seats in Scotland, and the seat became a safe Labour seat.\n\nSince then, the Conservatives had fallen into third and fourth place. The seat still has more Conservative voters than any other Glasgow constituency, but only 5,000 at the last election when it was replaced by Glasgow South.\n\nThe boundaries of the seat were significantly re-drawn between 1992 and 1997.\n"}

It is legally an Industrial and Provident Society although it is set up as a not-for-profit organisation, with any surplus in revenue reinvested in either share purchases in the club, or in its various running costs and projects.\n\nIn February 2011, CFU announced its plans to gain a controlling interest in Cambridge United and to turn it into a Community Trust Club. This followed the news that the club's owners had put the club up for sale, citing the need for new investment to take the club forward.\n\nCFU was initially formed as a supporters group to represent the views and interests of Cambridge United's fanbase, and to allow the club's continued operation. It also aimed to give fans a voice within the club through gaining a seat on the club's board, which they achieved in 2004 with the election of Brian Attmore as the first Fans' Elected Director.\n\nAfter celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2010, CFU refocussed its attention to develop its vision for the next decade.

CFU has become one of the largest shareholders and we seek to grow our shareholding and influence at boardroom level.\n\nIn November 2003, CFU helped save the club by raising £100,000 as part of the Bridge the Gap campaign. In the following years, the financial and practical assistance we provided was crucial to Cambridge United surviving Administration.

We have provided both guidance and advice on a regular basis to a number of other clubs and trusts. Within the supporters' trust movement CFU are well respected and in 2004 we won 'Trust of the Year'.\n\nCFU introduced and developed the South Stand scheme, which has seen thousands of people come to matches and also raised awareness of the club to many thousands of others. CFU have provided finance and administrative support to ensure the schemes' success.\n\nFor the past 10 years, CFU has supported Cambridge United Youth Development via finance, material items and practical assistance. We have sponsored CRC and the Youth Team as well as sponsoring individual players such as Michael Morrison. This season we will again be CRC's Match Day Sponsor and we are sponsoring goalkeeper Martin Trunca.\n\nCFU members have freely donated their services, skills and time throughout the past ten years, working hard in many roles within the club. For example, CFU helped carry out work to improve the office portacabins, the fans' bar and the gym at the R Costings Abbey. Over the years, CFU have also donated many items ranging from training goals, bicycles, computers, televisions and radios for the blind.\n\nCFU has instigated numerous projects to raise funds for our club.

They are set in a dystopian future in which people are allowed to live only one day of the week. For the rest of the six days they are \"stoned,\" a kind of suspended animation. The novels focus on a man, Jeff Caird, who is a daybreaker: someone who lives more than one day a week. As the series progresses, the main character seems to be suffering from dissociative identity disorder. The novels comprising the trilogy are:\n\n\nIn 2016, a prequel to the trilogy, \"Dayworld: A Hole in Wednesday\", by Philip José Farmer and Danny Adams, was published. Adams also collaborated with Farmer on the short novel \"The City Beyond Play\".\n\nJeff Caird is a citizen of Tuesday-World N.E. (New Era) 1330. The book starts on D5-W1 (Day-Five, Week-One) in the Second Month of N.E. 1330. (Each day of the week is the same day number, i.e. Sun-Sat will still be D5-W1). The book takes place over a full week, from Tuesday-World D5-W1 to Tuesday-World D6-W1. Jeff Caird is an 'organic' (police officer) by profession. Each day of the week organics have a different outfit. Also, each day of the week has a different fashion trend, TV shows, news, and so on, most people only knowing about each in his or her own day. However, Jeff Caird is a daybreaker, and not only that, he's an immer. The immers are a group of individuals living and acting beneath the radar of the government. The goal of the immers is to slowly and subtly change the government for the better. There are immers in just about every aspect of society in each day of the week. Jeff Caird is special in that he is a daybreaker as sanctioned by the immers, used to pass messages from day to day. As a daybreaker, Caird has mentally created a different identity for himself for each day of the week, different jobs, different friends, and different wives all included.\n\nA stoner is the device which triggers the suspended animation which each and every citizen of the respective day must, by law, be in by 11:30 PM. At 11:35 (in accordance with a five-minute grace period) the stoners turn on and the occupant is essentially frozen in time, resembling a stone statue.
