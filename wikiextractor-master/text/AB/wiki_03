It is also the seat of the Juan Martín de Pueyrredón Department.\n\nSan Luis lies at the feet of the Sierras Grandes, along the northern bank of the Chorrillos River, and is set in a Dry Pampas plateau around 730 m (2,400 ft) above sea level.\n\nPoints of interest in the city include the Park of the Nations, the neoclassical cathedral, a number of museums including the \"Dora Ochoa De Masramón Provincial Museum\", and the colonial architecture. A number of landmarks honor the Argentine War of Independence, as well. Independence Park features an equestrian monument to General José de San Martín, liberator of Argentina, Chile and Perú. Nearby Pringles Plaza honors Colonel Juan Pascual Pringles, one of San Martín's chief adjutants and, briefly, Governor of San Luis Province.\n\nFishing in the nearby Lake Potrero de los Funes, and other locations, is also popular. The Sierra de las Quijadas National Park is located 122 kilometres from the city. The city's climate is dry, with July average temperature between 3 and 15 °C and January average between 18 and 31 °C, an annual average of 17 °C. The extremes temperatures in this city are −10 and +41 °C\n\nNational Route 7 connects San Luis to Mendoza (255 km to the west), and Buenos Aires (791 km to the east). The San Luis Airport is located less than 2 miles north of downtown, and has regular flights to Buenos Aires.\n\nSan Luis was founded on August 25, 1594, by Luis Jufré de Loaysa y Meneses. The settlement was later abandoned, and was reestablished in 1632 by Martín García Oñez de Loyola as \"San Luis de Loyola Nueva Medina de Río Seco\".\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, San Luis had 7,000 inhabitants, and in 1882 the Argentine Great Western Railway reached the city on its way to Chile. The following year, work began on the cathedral. The Governor's Executive Building, designed in French renaissance architecture, was completed in 1911. The city's population reached 40,000 in 1960, and grew rapidly afterwards, when light industry and growing numbers of retirees began to migrate to the area; at the , its population was 153,322.\n\nBecause the city is located at the part of the Sierras Grandes known as \"Punta de los Venados\", the inhabitants of the city are called \"puntanos\".\n\nSan Luis has a semi-arid climate (\"BSh/BSk\", according to the Köppen climate classification) and it closely borders a humid subtropical climate (\"Cwa\"). Summers are hot and humid, and winters are cool and dry, with temperatures falling below sometimes and snowfalls can occur occasionally. The hottest month, January, has an average temperature of , and the coldest month, July, has an average of . The annual average temperature is .\n\n"}

The objects of the Appeal as stated in its constitution were \"to provide medicines, medical equipment and medical assistance to the people of Iraq; to highlight the causes and results of the cancer epidemic in Iraq and to arrange for the medical treatment of a number of Iraqi children outside Iraq\". The campaign was founded by the politician George Galloway, then a member of parliament, Princess Sarvath, wife of then Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, was patron of the Appeal.\n\nThe Mariam Appeal was intended \"to campaign against sanctions on Iraq which are having disastrous effects on the ordinary people of Iraq.\" The campaign was named after Mariam Hamza, a child flown by the fund from Iraq to Britain to receive treatment for leukaemia. The intention was to raise awareness of the suffering and death of tens of thousands of other Iraqi children due to poor health conditions and lack of suitable medicines and facilities, and to campaign for the lifting of the sanctions seen by many as a direct cause of those problems.\n\nAmong the activities undertaken was a daily newsletter on sanctions, a sanctions-busting flight to Baghdad, the Big Ben to Baghdad trip in a red London bus, meetings and conferences, the projection of an anti-war slogan on the House of Commons, and the facilitating of trips to Iraq by dozens of journalists.\n\nThe fund received scrutiny during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, after a complaint to the office of the Attorney General for England and Wales that Galloway used some of the donation money to pay his travel expenses. Galloway, however, denied that he had misused any funds raised for the Mariam Appeal and pointed out that it was reasonable for money from a campaign fund to be used to pay for the travel expenses of campaigners. Over the next four years Galloway faced several investigations related to the Appeal including the Oil-for-Food Program Hearings.\n\nThe Mariam Appeal was investigated by the Charity Commission on more than one occasion. Although the Appeal was not a registered charity, the commission had jurisdiction to take action on funds raised in England and Wales on charitable grounds.\nThe report of the first, year-long, inquiry was published in June 2004.\n\nThe Charity Commission took the view that the political activities of the Appeal were ancillary to the charitable purposes of the Appeal and that the Trustees could reasonably have formed the view that this would have the impact of enabling treatment for sick children. The Commission found that the Appeal had done charitable work and raised significant funds, so should have registered with them and published accounts, taking the view that the legal advice the Appeal founders had taken that the constitution did not create a charity was wrong. It established that Dr. Amineh Abu-Zayyad, a Palestinian, who was married to Galloway between 2000 and 2005, had received unauthorised benefits in the form of salary payments from the Appeal's funds, although the executive committee considered these payments necessary and were unaware that they were unauthorised.\n\nThe Charity Commission did not find other evidence to support the allegations that funds had been misused. Examination of the Appeal's bank accounts revealed the major funders to be the United Arab Emirates, a donor from Saudi Arabia and the Jordanian businessman Fawaz Zureikat (later alleged to be implicated in the Oil-for-Food Programme scandal). Some of the Appeal's books and records had been sent to Amman and Baghdad in 2001 when Fawaz Zuriekat took over as Chairman of the Appeal and could not now be located. The Appeal had not produced annual profit and loss accounts or balance sheets.\n\nAs the Appeal was by this time closed, full records were unavailable, that the founders believed on legal advice that they had not created a charity, and there was no evidence that the funds of the Appeal were misapplied (other than for salaries), the Charity Commission decided to take no further action other than informing the Trustees of their mistakes.\n\nA further Charity Commission Report published on 7 June 2007 found that the Appeal had received funds from Fawaz Zureikat that originated from the Oil For Food programme.\n\nThe UK Parliament's Standards Commissioner launched a four-year investigation independently of the Charity Commission, but with its involvement. \n\nAt a press conference following publication of the report, Galloway stated \"To be deprived of the company for 18 days of the honourable ladies and gentleman behind me [in parliament] will be painful ... but I'm intending to struggle on regardless ... What really upset them [the committee] is that I always defend myself.\n\nIt was claimed in June 2017, after a request under the Freedom of Information Act by \"The Times\" newspaper that Galloway's then wife Dr. Amineh Abu-Zayyad had received £84,000 in salary and expenses from the appeal after being appointed as its medical and scientific officer without any appropriate process and without a contract of employment. The Yorkhill NHS Trust in Glasgow received £54,000 drawn from the appeal in partial payment for the care of Mariam Hamza herself. Both Galloway, who claimed £3,000 in travel expenses, and his wife were trustees of the charity. Legally, \"The Times\" Dominic Kennedy wrote, a person in such a position of trust is not permitted to benefit financially without proper authorisation.\n\n"}

{"id": "1918041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918041", "title": "Phantom pain", "text": "Phantom pain\n\nPhantom pain is a perception that an individual experiences relating to a limb or an organ that is not physically part of the body. Limb loss is a result of either removal by amputation or congenital limb deficiency. However, phantom limb sensations can also occur following nerve avulsion or spinal cord injury.\n\nSensations are recorded most frequently following the amputation of an arm or a leg, but may also occur following the removal of a breast, tooth, or an internal organ. Phantom limb pain is the feeling of pain in an absent limb or a portion of a limb. The pain sensation varies from individual to individual.\n\nPhantom limb sensation is any sensory phenomenon (except pain) which is felt at an absent limb or a portion of the limb. It has been known that at least 80% of amputees experience phantom sensations at some time of their lives. Some experience some level of this phantom pain and feeling in the missing limb for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe term \"phantom limb\" was first coined by American neurologist Silas Weir Mitchell in 1871. Mitchell described that \"thousands of spirit limbs were haunting as many good soldiers, every now and then tormenting them\". However, in 1551, French military surgeon Ambroise Paré recorded the first documentation of phantom limb pain when he reported that, \"For the patients, long after the amputation is made, say that they still feel pain in the amputated part\".\n\nPhantom pain involves the sensation of pain in a part of the body that has been removed.\n\nSymptoms include: Onset within the first few days of amputation. Comes and goes or is continuous. Often affects the part of the limb farthest from the body, such as the foot of an amputated leg. May be described as shooting, stabbing, boring, squeezing, throbbing or burning. Sometimes feels as if the phantom part is forced into an uncomfortable position. May be triggered by pressure on the remaining part of the limb or emotional stress.\n\nThere are various types of sensations that may be felt:\n\n\nThe neurological basis and mechanisms for phantom limb pain are all derived from experimental theories and observations. Little is known about the true mechanism causing phantom pains, and many theories highly overlap. Historically, phantom pains were thought to originate from neuromas located at the stump tip. Traumatic neuromas, or non-tumor nerve injuries, often arise from surgeries and result from the abnormal growth of injured nerve fibers. Although stump neuromas contribute to phantom pains, they are not the sole cause. This is because patients with congenital limb deficiency can sometimes, although rarely, experience phantom pains. This suggests that there is a central representation of the limb responsible for painful sensations. Currently, theories are based on altered neurological pathways and cortical reorganization.\n\nNeuromas formed from injured nerve endings at the stump site are able to fire abnormal action potentials, and were historically thought to be the main cause of phantom limb pain. Although neuromas are able to contribute to phantom pain, pain is not completely eliminated when peripheral nerves are treated with conduction blocking agents. Physical stimulation of neuromas can increase C fiber activity, thus increasing phantom pain, but pain still persists once the neuromas have ceased firing action potentials. The peripheral nervous system is thought to have at most a modulation effect on phantom limb pain.\n\nIn addition to peripheral mechanisms, spinal mechanisms are thought to have an influencing role in phantom pains. Peripheral nerve injury can lead to the degeneration of C fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and terminating A fibers may subsequently branch into the same lamina. If this occurs, A fiber inputs could be reported as noxious stimuli. Substance P, involved in the transmission of pain signals, is usually expressed by Aδ and C fibers, but following peripheral nerve damage, substance P is expressed by Aβ fibers. This leads to hyperexcitability of the spinal cord, which usually occurs only in the presence of noxious stimuli. Because patients with complete spinal cord injury have experienced phantom pains, there must be an underlying central mechanism responsible for the generation of phantom pains.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, the genetically determined circuitry in the brain remains largely stable throughout life. It was thought, until about 30 years ago, that no new neural circuits could be formed in the adult mammalian brain. Recently, functional MRI studies in amputees have shown that almost all patients have experienced motor cortical remapping. The majority of motor reorganization has occurred as a downward shift of the hand area of the cortex onto the area of face representation, especially the lips. Sometimes there is a side shift of the hand motor cortex to the ipsilateral cortex. In patients with phantom limb pain, the reorganization was great enough to cause a change in cortical lip representation into the hand areas only during lip movements. It has also been found that there is a high correlation between the magnitude of phantom limb pain and the extent to which the shift of the cortical representation of the mouth into the hand area in motor and somatosensory cortical reorganization has occurred. Additionally, as phantom pains in upper extremity amputees increased, there was a higher degree of medial shift of the facial motor representation. There are multiple theories that try to explain how cortical remapping occurs in amputees, but none have been supported to a great extent.\n\nThe neuromatrix theory proposes that there is an extensive network connecting the thalamus and the cortex, and the cortex and the limbic system. It is a theory that extends beyond body schema theory and incorporates the conscious awareness of oneself. This theory proposes that conscious awareness and the perception of self are generated in the brain via patterns of input that can be modified by different perceptual inputs. The network is genetically predetermined, and is modified throughout one’s lifetime by various sensory inputs to create a neurosignature. It is the neurosignature of a specific body part that determines how it is consciously perceived. The input systems contributing to the neurosignature are primarily the somatosensory, limbic, and thalamocortical systems. The neuromatrix theory aims to explain how certain activities associated with pain lead to the conscious perception of phantom pain. The persistence of the neurosignature, even after limb amputation, may be the cause of phantom sensations and pain. Phantom pain may arise from abnormal reorganization in the neuromatrix to a pre-existing pain state.\n\nOpposition to the neuromatrix theory exists largely because it fails to explain why relief from phantom sensations rarely eliminates phantom pains. It also does not address how sensations can spontaneously end and how some amputees do not experience phantom sensations at all. In addition, a major limitation of the neuromatrix theory is that it too broadly accounts for various aspects of phantom limb perception. It is also likely that it is too difficult to be tested empirically, especially when testing painless phantom sensations.\n\nVarious methods have been used to treat phantom limb pain. Doctors may prescribe medications to reduce the pain. Some antidepressants or antiepileptics have been shown to have a beneficial effect on reducing phantom limb pain. Often physical methods such as light massage, electrical stimulation, and hot and cold therapy have been used with variable results.\n\nThere are many different treatment options for phantom limb pain that are actively being researched. Most treatments do not take into account the mechanisms underlying phantom pains, and are therefore ineffective. However, there are a few treatment options that have been shown to alleviate pain in some patients, but these treatment options usually have a success rate less than 30%. It is important to note that this rate of success does not exceed the placebo effect. It is also important to note that because the degree of cortical reorganization is proportional to phantom limb pains, any perturbations to the amputated regions may increase pain perception.\n\nMirror box therapy allows for illusions of movement and touch in a phantom limb by inducing somatosensory and motor pathway coupling between the phantom and real limb. Many patients experience pain as a result of a clenched phantom limb, and because phantom limbs are not under voluntary control, unclenching becomes impossible. This theory proposes that the phantom limb feels paralyzed because there is no feedback from the phantom back to the brain to inform it otherwise. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran believes that if the brain received visual feedback that the limb had moved, then the phantom limb would become unparalyzed.\n\nAlthough the use of mirror therapy has been shown to be effective in some cases there is still no widely accepted theory of how it works. According to 2017 paper that reviewed a wide range of studies of mirror therapy, \"Research evidence suggests that a course of treatment (four weeks) of mirror therapy may reduce chronic pain. Contraindications and side effects are few. The mechanism of action of mirror therapy remains uncertain, with reintegration of motor and sensory systems, restored body image and control over fear-avoidance likely to influence outcome. The evidence for clinical efficacy of mirror therapy is encouraging, but not yet definitive. Nevertheless, mirror therapy is inexpensive, safe and easy for the patient to self-administer.\"\n\nLittle research was published on MT before 2009, and much of the research since then has been of low quality. Out of 115 publications between 2012 and 2017 about using mirror therapy to treat phantom limb pain, a 2018 review, found only 15 studies whose scientific results should be considered. From these 15 studies, the reviewers concluded that \"MT seems to be effective in relieving PLP, reducing the intensity and duration of daily pain episodes. It is a valid, simple, and inexpensive treatment for PLP.\"\n\nPharmacological techniques are often continued in conjunction with other treatment options. Doses of pain medications needed often drop substantially when combined with other techniques, but rarely are discontinued completely. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, and sodium channel blockers, mainly carbamazepine, are often used to relieve chronic pain, and recently have been used in an attempt to reduce phantom pains. Pain relief may also be achieved through use of opioids, ketamine, calcitonin, and lidocaine.\n\nDeep brain stimulation is a surgical technique used to alleviate patients from phantom limb pain. Prior to surgery, patients undergo functional brain imaging techniques such as PET scans and functional MRI to determine an appropriate trajectory of where pain is originating. Surgery is then carried out under local anesthetic, because patient feedback during the operation is needed. In the study conducted by Bittar et al., a radiofrequency electrode with four contact points was placed on the brain. Once the electrode was in place, the contact locations were altered slightly according to where the patient felt the greatest relief from pain. Once the location of maximal relief was determined, the electrode was implanted and secured to the skull. After the primary surgery, a secondary surgery under general anesthesia was conducted. A subcutaneous pulse generator was implanted into a pectoral pocket below the clavicle to stimulate the electrode. It was found that all three patients studied had gained satisfactory pain relief from the deep brain stimulation. Pain had not been completely eliminated, but the intensity had been reduced by over 50% and the burning component had completely vanished.\n\nPhantom limb pain and phantom limb sensations are linked, but must be differentiated from one another. While phantom limb sensations are experienced by those with congenital limb deficiency, spinal cord injury, and amputation, phantom limb pain occurs almost exclusively as a result of amputation. Almost immediately following the amputation of a limb, 90–98% of patients report experiencing a phantom sensation. Nearly 75% of individuals experience the phantom as soon as anesthesia wears off, and the remaining 25% of patients experience phantoms within a few days or weeks. Of those experiencing innocuous sensations, a majority of patients also report distinct painful sensations.\n\nAge and gender have not been shown to affect the onset or duration of phantom limb pain. Although it has not been fully explored, one investigation of lower limb amputation observed that as stump length decreased, there was a greater incidence of moderate and severe phantom pain.\n\n\n"}

He also was the first manager in the history of the expansion edition of the Senators (now the Texas Rangers), serving from 1961 through May 21, 1963, and was a coach for four MLB teams between 1960 and 1982.\n\nHe retired as a player in 1960 with 2,495 hits, and holds the major league record for career double plays at first base (2,044). He has the American League (AL) record for career games (2,227), putouts (19,754), assists (1,444) and total chances (21,408). The lanky Vernon was listed as tall and ; he batted and threw left-handed.\n\nMickey Vernon was born in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, and attended Villanova University, before making his major league debut on July 8, 1939. He was the father of Gay Vernon.\n\nDuring World War II, he served in the United States Navy, missing the 1944 and 1945 seasons. He served with major league players Larry Doby and Billy Goodman on Ulithi in the South Pacific in 1945; both Goodman and Vernon personally inspired Doby to become a major league baseball player; Doby became the first African-American to break the baseball color line in the American League in 1947 with the Cleveland Indians.\n\nVernon played for 14 full major league seasons (400 at bats or more) in his 20-year career. He wound up batting over .335 twice, over .300 five times, and over .290 nine times. He was a two-time American League batting champion. In , his .353 batting mark eclipsed Ted Williams' .342 by 11 points. Then, in , Vernon's .337 average denied Cleveland's Al Rosen (.336) the Triple Crown by just one one-thousandth of a point. The following year, , Vernon had a career high 20 home runs, 97 RBIs, and a career high 14 triples. He led the AL in doubles with a total of 33. He also had 294 total bases, which was second in the AL, behind Minnie Miñoso.\n\nOver time, Vernon became one of the best-liked ballplayers, mainly through his unique personality and charismatic, but quiet, style. On September 1, 1960, after a season spent as the Pittsburgh Pirates' first-base coach, Vernon was placed on the active list when MLB rosters expanded to 40 men. He appeared in nine regular-season games as a pinch hitter for Pittsburgh, notching an RBI single and an intentional walk in his nine plate appearances to become one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in a major league game in four decades. By his final game played, on September 27, 1960, he was, at 42, the oldest player in the National League by almost a year, and one of the most popular figures in the game. He appeared in 2,409 MLB games without playing in the postseason, third most in history behind Ernie Banks and Luke Appling. Notably, on September 25, 1960, during Vernon's time on the active list, the Pirates clinched the NL pennant; but he was not on the Pirate playing roster for the 1960 World Series, resuming his full-time coaching duties. He earned a World Series ring when the Bucs triumphed in seven games over the New York Yankees.\n\nVernon posted a career .286 batting average with 172 home runs and 1,311 RBIs in 2,409 games. The left-hander averaged 88 RBIs a year, and had 11 seasons with 80 or more, 3 with 90 or more. He scored 1,196 runs with 137 stolen bases and a .359 on-base percentage. His career slugging percentage was .428, with a career high of .518 in 1953. He compiled 2,495 hits, with 490 doubles and 120 triples, in 8,731 at bats. He had 3,741 career total bases, with his career high coming in 1953 (315).\n\nVernon's career as a coach and manager began during his 1960 stint on the staff of his longtime friend, Pirates' skipper Danny Murtaugh. \n\nThe following year, in , he returned to Washington when he was named manager of the expansion Senators in their first year of existence. Inheriting the name and home field of the 1901–60 Washington franchise, now the Minnesota Twins, the expansion Senators were hastily constructed with an undercapitalized ownership, an MLB roster of castoff players, and an almost-nonexistent farm system. In Vernon's two full seasons at the helm, 1961 and , the Senators lost a combined 201 games. They were 14–26 and last in the ten-team American League when Vernon was fired on May 21, 1963. He finished with a career record of 135–227, a .373 winning percentage.\n\nVernon remained in the game into the 1980s as a major league coach for the Pirates (returning there for a second term in 1964), St. Louis Cardinals (1965), Montreal Expos (1977–78) and Yankees (1982).

He is best known as a founding member of the hard rock band Mountain.\n\nWest was born in New York City, to a Jewish family. He grew up in Hackensack, New Jersey, and in East Meadow, New York, Forest Hills, New York and Lawrence, New York. After his parents divorced, he changed his surname to West. His musical career began with the Vagrants, an R&B/blue-eyed soul-rock band influenced by the likes of the Rascals that was one of the few teenage garage rock acts to come out of the New York metropolitan area itself (as opposed to the Bohemian Greenwich Village scene of artists, poets and affiliates of the Beat Generation, which produced bands like The Fugs and The Velvet Underground). The Vagrants had two minor hits in the Eastern US: 1966's \"I Can't Make a Friend\" and a cover of Otis Redding's \"Respect\" the following year.\n\nSome of the Vagrants' recordings were produced by Felix Pappalardi, who was also working with Cream on their album \"Disraeli Gears\". In 1969, West and Pappalardi formed the pioneering hard rock act Mountain, which was also the title of West's debut solo album. \"Rolling Stone\" identified the band as a \"louder version of Cream\". With Steve Knight on keyboards and original drummer N. D. Smart, the band appeared on the second day of the Woodstock Festival on Saturday, August 16, 1969 starting an 11-song set at 9 pm.\n\nThe band's original incarnation saw West and Pappalardi sharing vocal duties and playing guitar and bass, respectively. New drummer Corky Laing joined the band shortly after Woodstock. They had success with \"Mississippi Queen\", which reached No. 21 on the Billboard charts and No. 4 in Canada. It was followed by the Jack Bruce-penned \"Theme For an Imaginary Western\". Mountain is one of the bands considered to be forerunners of heavy metal.\n\nAfter Pappalardi left Mountain to concentrate on various production projects, West and Laing produced two studio albums and a live release with Cream bassist Jack Bruce under the name West, Bruce and Laing. West, along with keyboard player Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat & Tears, recorded with The Who during the March 1971 \"Who's Next\" New York sessions. Tracks included a cover of Marvin Gaye's \"Baby Don't You Do It,\" and early versions of \"Love Ain't For Keepin'\" and The Who's signature track \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". Though the tracks were not originally included on the album (recording restarted in England a few months later without West or Kooper), they appear as bonus tracks on the 1995 and 2003 reissues of \"Who's Next\" and on the 1998 reissue of \"Odds & Sods\".\n\nMountain reformed in 1973 only to break up again in late 1974. West had acting roles in \"Family Honor\" (1973) and \"The Money Pit\" (1986). \n\nWest also played guitar for the track \"Bo Diddley Jam\" on Bo Diddley's 1976 \"20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll\" all-star album. Since 1981, the group \"Mountain\" has continued to reform, tour and record on a regular basis. Leslie West teamed up with Ian Gillan of Deep Purple fame, to co-write and play guitar on the song \"Hang Me Out To Dry\" from the Gillan album \"ToolBox\", released in Europe in 1991. Leslie West and Joe Bonamassa recorded Warren Haynes' \"If Heartaches Were Nickels\" together. West released it on \"Guitarded\" (2005), and Bonamassa on \"A New Day Yesterday\" (2000). In May 1987, West played the band leader in a series of late night pilot shows for Howard Stern on the FOX network. He taped a total of five shows with Stern, which never aired. Stern went on to form a new show dubbed the Channel 9 show without Leslie. West continues to make occasional appearances on radio, notably on Howard Stern's radio show.\n\nWest contributed the music and co-wrote the lyrics to the song \"Immortal\" on Clutch's 2001 album \"Pure Rock Fury\", which was a reworked cover of the song \"Baby I'm Down\" from West's first album. In 2005 he contributed to Ozzy Osbourne's \"Under Cover\" album, performing guitar on a remake of \"Mississippi Queen\". In addition to fronting Mountain, West continued to record and perform on his own. His solo album, entitled \"Blue Me\", was released in 2006 on the Blues Bureau International label. West was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on October 15, 2006. In 2007, Mountain released \"Masters of War\" on Big Rack Records, an album featuring 12 Bob Dylan covers that saw Ozzy Osbourne providing guest vocals on a rendition of the title track.\n\nWest married his fiancée Jenni Maurer on stage after Mountain's performance at the Woodstock 40th anniversary concert in Bethel, New York (August 15, 2009). Over 15,000 people were present and the couple walked through a bridge of guitars held by Levon Helm, Larry Taylor and Corky Laing among others. West now lives in New Jersey. On June 20, 2011, West had his lower right leg amputated as a result of complications from diabetes. West made his first public appearance after his surgery on August 13, 2011. In 2014, West was a guest performer on Eli Cook's album, \"Primitive Son\". His 2015 album, \"Soundcheck\", peaked at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Top Blues Albums chart.\n\nWest is renowned for helping popularize the Gibson Les Paul Jr. guitar with P-90 pickups, along with the use of Sunn Amplifiers, to create a tone which became his trademark sound.\n\nWest frequently used two Les Paul Juniors, one \"TV Yellow\" and the other a sunburst. West also used a modified Gibson Flying V, with the neck pickup removed (he used the hole for an ashtray) and a P-90 pickup fitted at the bridge position, West also had a two-pickup Flying V which he used after the Flying V with the ash tray broke (serial number 906965). West also used a plexiglass Electra guitar, which is a Japanese copy of the better known Ampeg made Dan Armstrong guitar, for slide.\n\nWest also played a Westone Pantera guitar. From 1977 to 1982, he used a signature on-board effects MPC model guitar, created by the Japanese company Electra. He currently uses a signature model from Dean Guitars, the USA Soltero Leslie West Signature model, fitted with a custom-designed Dean pickup called \"Mountain of Tone.\" Based on an endorsing contract in the Seventies, West played British made Burns guitars. West has also long favored \"headless\" guitars, and can be seen playing them on some of the videos he has appeared in. In an interview segment on \"Night of the Guitars – Live!\" West stated that he had narrowed his commonly played instruments down to two: an off-the-shelf Steinberger and a Kramer with DiMarzio pickups.\n\nIn 2005, West received a sponsorship with Carlsbro amplifiers, and could frequently be seen playing through \"Carlsbro 50 Top\" valve heads. His studio amplifier is a Marshall JMP. Live, he used Marshall JCM 900s. He started endorsing and using Budda Amplification in 2008. He was also associated with Sunn amplifiers, and used a Sunn Coliseum PA head, when it was shipped to him by accident. He claims that this is the amp that gave him his signature sound in this Gibson Interview with West.\n\nThe Sunn amplifiers that West used were of the late 1960s era and were not factory stock. The 4-channel amplifier heads' preamps were wired as cascading preamps to 1 channel, out to the amp's power section. That's what produced the long compressed sustain and distorted overdrive of the great Mountain sound that he is well known for. This is years before Mesa Boogie Amplifiers with a similar idea got their amps on the world stage, but Boogies do have their own sound comparatively.\nLeslie West currently uses Blackstar amps\n\nWest uses octaver, chorus and delay effects.\n\n\"For his work with Mountain and West, Bruce and Laing, see their pages.\"\n\n"}

It is the home field of the Idaho State Bengals of the Big Sky Conference and sits at an elevation of above sea level.\n\nOriginally named the ASISU Minidome—named after the Associated Students of Idaho State University, who funded construction—it opened in 1970 at the north end of the ISU campus. Holt Arena is the oldest enclosed stadium on a college campus in the United States and the second-oldest overall. Only the Houston Astrodome, completed in 1965, predates it. Since the Astrodome's 2006 closure Holt Arena has been the oldest enclosed stadium in use. The original artificial turf installed in 1970 was Poly-Turf. The venue was renamed in 1988 to honor Milton W. \"Dubby\" Holt (1914–2007), ISU's athletic director from 1967 to 1989.\n\nAs assistant athletic director, Holt conceived the indoor arena in 1966 and it was designed by architect Cedric M. Allen. Although a controversial design proposal for the time, ISU students voted to appropriate not more than $2.8 million to the project two years later. The arena was built entirely with these voluntary student funds. With over 56% in favor, ISU students approved a $12 increase in semester fees to fund the stadium in early 1968.\n\nAfter 41 football seasons on Poly-Turf and AstroTurf, infilled synthetic turf was installed in Holt Arena in July 2011. Similar to FieldTurf, the SoftTop Removable Matrix System is also installed in AT&T Stadium in the NFL.\n\nHolt Arena replaced the outdoor \"Spud Bowl\" (now Davis Field, at ) as the Bengals' home football stadium in 1970. At the south end of campus, Davis Field continues as the home venue for outdoor track and field and soccer.\n\nHolt Arena also serves as home for the ISU indoor track and field team and men's basketball team. It also hosts high school football games, the famous Simplot Games high school indoor track meet, along with other sporting events, rodeos, concerts, and other activities.\n\nDuring ISU's run in basketball to the Elite Eight in 1977, they won the Big Sky regular season title, which allowed them to host the four-team conference tournament, which they also won. The Bengals were allowed to stay home for the first round of the 32-team NCAA tournament, as the Minidome had a pair of first round games (sub-regionals) on Saturday, March 12. UCLA defeated Louisville and hometown ISU beat Long Beach State. (Five days later, Idaho State stunned UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen at the West regional in Provo, Utah.) Between the Big Sky tourney and the NCAA games, the venue also hosted the state's three-day A-1 (now 5A) high school championship tournament.\nFollowing the success of the Minidome, several other colleges built enclosed stadiums, including the Kibbie Dome at the University of Idaho in Moscow, which was enclosed in 1975 after four years as an outdoor stadium, and the Walkup Skydome at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, opened in 1977.\n\nIt is one of three indoor football stadiums currently in use in the Big Sky Conference, along with the Kibbie Dome and Walkup Skydome. During the final six seasons of Idaho's absence from Big Sky football (2012–2017), the Alerus Center at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks was another indoor stadium used in Big Sky football, but UND left the Big Sky after the 2017 football season.\n\nHolt Arena features of floor space; the building is recessed below grade and rises above grade at its highest point.\n\nHolt Arena hosted the 2018 Convention of the Idaho Republican Party, which was held June 28 through June 30.\n\n\n"}

The idea is that a small body of four or five people is better able to make certain decisions than a large, unwieldy city council. Boards of Control were introduced in many North American municipalities in the early 20th century as a product of the municipal reform movement. They proved unpopular with many as they tended to centralize power in a small body while disempowering city councils.\n\nBoards of Control typically consist of the mayor and several Controllers who are elected on a citywide basis as opposed to aldermen who were elected on a ward basis. The Boards were criticized as undemocratic. Boards of Control tended to be less representative of the diverse opinions and communities with majority views among the population being overrepresented. As well, since they were elected by a larger electorate running for a seat on the Board of Control would be prohibitively expensive for many municipal politicians resulting in wealthier politicians being more likely to run for the body. Lastly, Boards of Control tended to meet \"in camera\" rather than in open session in the manner of city councils making them less accountable to the public.\n\nBecause of these problems, many municipalities abolished Boards of Control in the years following World War II. They were maintained in several municipalities in suburban Toronto, Ontario, Canada, into the late 1980s, including North York, Scarborough, York, and Etobicoke. The City of London, Ontario was one of the few remaining municipalities in North America to retain a Board of Control. It was abolished after the 2010 municipal elections.\n\n"}
{"id": "1918131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918131", "title": "Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign", "text": "Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign\n\nGermany and Poland were the main opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign. The September Campaign was the joint Invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, the Free City of Danzig, the Soviet Union, and a small Slovak contingent marking the beginning of WW II in Europe.\n\nTactics and military hardware used in the Invasion of Poland varied between the two sides; The German economy was geared toward military production which supplied their armed forces with equipment that was often superior to their Polish counterparts. Old tactics such as Vernichtungsgedanke and the concept of the Schwerpunkt combined with newly mechanized units punched holes in Polish lines and close air support provided by the world class Luftwaffe disrupted Polish supply and communications lines. Other German tactics included the targeting of civilian targets in terror bombings to inflict huge losses amongst the civilian population, sending streams of refugees out of afflicted areas, thereby hampering Polish logistics. In 1939 the German navy also had an advantage over the tiny Polish fleet.\n\nPreparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. The Polish Army had about a million soldiers, but fewer than half had been mobilised by 1 September due to political pressure from France and Britain. The Polish-Soviet War showed Poland the benefits of mobility in military conflicts but Polish officials were unwilling (and unable) to invest heavily to make that a reality. Polish Cavalry Brigades were still effectively used as mobile infantry but in the end fell against German motorized units, however Germany also used cavalry for transportation during the September Campaign. The Polish Air Force lacked modern fighter aircraft for its highly trained pilots, while the Luftwaffe was much more numerous and had superior aircraft. The Polish Navy was a small fleet composed of destroyers and submarines, some of which survived the campaign by escaping to the North Sea to join with the Royal Navy.\n\nGermany was only moderately prepared for the invasion of Poland; stocks of ammunition and replacement vehicles, for example, were low, and historians regard Hitler's move as a military gamble as well as a political one. The German economy had for years geared toward production of military equipment and supplies, and was capable of creating an army that could successfully invade its neighbours only if the campaign was not a long one. In fact, in January 1939, while planning for the invasion of Poland was underway, the Wehrmacht's allocation of raw materials was cut, by some 30 percent of steel, 20 percent in copper, 47 percent in aluminum and 14 percent in rubber. Moreover, the German economy was never fully mobilized for war, with Joseph Goebbels belatedly calling for \"Total War\" only in 1943. Millions of Reichsmarks went into consumer goods, the female population was never harnessed efficiently for use in war production (James Lucas notes in his book \"Reich\" that 1 million German women were employed as hairdressers as late as 1943 instead of in armaments or war related industry), and many workers in the German war economy later in the war were unwilling slave labourers. As early as 1940, British production \"though still lackadaisical, outstripped that of Germany in aircraft, tanks and heavy guns, in everything in fact except equipment for a large army.\" (A.J.P. Taylor, \"The Second World War\", 1975).\n\nThe Polish Campaign, and the spectre of war with Britain and France, did not change things. Walter Warlimont, who headed the Department of Home Defence for the Wehrmacht, wrote postwar:\n\nIn the fact of the successful Polish campaign, Hitler (still) refused to order mobilisation in the full sense of the word; later on, partial mobilisation was ordered, but the economy was specifically exempted...None of the carefully thought-out measures designed to protect the armament industry by keeping its skilled workers on the job was put into effect. (Quoted in \"Brute Force\" (Ellis, Viking Penguin, 1990))\n\nThe German military was collectively known as the Wehrmacht, and all three components had separate but related roles to play in the campaign. The firepower of a German infantry division far exceeded that of a Polish (as well as French and British) infantry division. The standard Heer infantry division on the eve of the Second World War included 442 machine guns, 135 mortars, 72 antitank guns, and 24 howitzers.\n\nGermany had not only a large numerical advantage over Polish forces, but their organisation and command structure was much more efficient. While German forces were not as mobile or numerous as they would be in the later stages of the Second World War, the Wehrmacht had some 2,400 tanks organized into six armoured (panzer) divisions using operational doctrine developed during and after the First World War, coupled with older concepts such as Vernichtungsgedanken. German tanks of this period Panzer I, Panzer II, Panzer III and the most advanced Panzer IV.\nIn accordance with the ideas of Heinz Guderian, German tanks and mechanized support units (motorized artillery, etc.) were used in massive, mechanized spearhead (\"Schwerpunkt\") attacks, serving as highly mobile units to punch holes in the enemy line and isolate selected enemy units, which the infantry would then encircle and destroy while the armored and mechanized forces pushed forward to repeat the process, eventually breaking through enemy frontlines and then dispersing, causing confusion in the rear areas and severing lines of supply and communication.\nLess mobile mechanized infantry and regular infantry (who, along with their horse-drawn artillery support, vastly outnumbered their mechanized comrades) would then in theory follow-up the panzer divisions' penetration into enemy territory. The Heer was closely supported by the Luftwaffe, especially by dive bombers that attacked and disrupted the enemy's supply and communications lines and spread panic and confusion in its rear, thus further paralyzing the enemy's defensive capabilities. Mechanization was the key to this German tactic first revealed in the September Campaign and nicknamed \"blitzkrieg\" (lightning war) by contemporary journalists, who found the name fitting because of the unprecedented speed and mobility that were its underlying characteristics.\n\nDespite the term \"blitzkrieg\" being coined by the Allies during the Polish September Campaign of 1939, historians (such as Matthew Cooper) generally hold that German operations in Poland were more traditional than revolutionary. Cooper, for one, writes (in The German Army (1976)) that Heer strategy was more inline with \"Vernichtungsgedanken\", or a focus on envelopment to create pockets in broad-front annihilation. Mechanized forces were deployed among the three German concentrations without strong emphasis on independent use, being used to create or destroy close pockets of Polish forces and seize operational-depth terrain in support of the largely unmotorized infantry which followed.\n\nAircraft (particularly fighter and ground attack aircraft) played a major role in the fighting. Bomber aircraft purposely attacked cities and civilian targets causing huge losses amongst the civilian population in what became known as terror bombings. The Luftwaffe forces consisted of 1,180 fighter aircraft (mainly Bf 109s), 290 Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers, 290 conventional bombers (mainly of the He 111 and Do 17 types), and an assortment of 240 naval aircraft. In total, Germany had close to 3,000 aircraft (~2,000 of them can be considered militarily modern) with half of them deployed on the Polish front.\nThe German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, was also the best force of its kind in 1939. It was designed to support the army, but in air combat the German planes were superior to most designs fielded by the Allies. In the rearmament period from 1935 to 1939, the production of German combat aircraft steadily mounted, and the standardization of engines and airframes gave the Luftwaffe a repair and production advantage over its opponents.\n\nAt sea, the odds against the German Kriegsmarine were less favorable. They were much worse in September 1939 than in August 1914, as the Allies had many more large surface warships than Germany. However, the naval theater, for Germany, was of least significance. During the entire war there was to be no major encounter between the Allied and the German surface fleets, nothing that resembled the battle of Jutland from the previous war. Kriegsmarine activities saw only the individual operation of German pocket battleships and commerce raiders, with the rare exceptions of operations like the Operation Rheinübung, and submarine-driven Battle of the Atlantic. That noted, in 1939 Germany did have an advantage over the tiny Polish fleet, and the Western Allies were unwilling and unprepared to challenge the Kriegsmarine on the small, land-locked Baltic Sea.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in industrialization of the Centralny Okręg Przemysłowy, chosen for being reasonably far from both the Soviet and German frontiers. That heavy spending on military industry pushed much of the spending on actual weapons into 1940–42. Poland had been preparing for defensive war for many years; however, most plans assumed German aggression would not happen before 1942. Polish military industry development and fortifications were scheduled to be completed in that year, and newer tanks and aircraft were just entering production or would shortly.\n\nStarting in September 1936, France loaned Poland 2.6 billion francs over a 5-year period, which added 12% to the annual Polish military budget. The Polish defense budget for 1938–39 was 800 million złoty, of which: \n\nTo raise funds for industrial development, Poland was selling much of the modern equipment it produced; for example, anti-tank guns were sold to Britain and planes were exported to Greece.\n\nThe Polish Army was fairly strong in numbers (~1 million soldiers), but much of it was not mobilised by 1 September, as the Polish government, advised in this by the British and French governments, constantly hoped that the war could be resolved (at least for the time being) through diplomatic channels. Less than half of the Polish armed forces had been mobilized by 1 September, and only one-quarter (250,000) were fully equipped and in assigned positions when hostilities commenced. Thus many soldiers, mobilised after 1 September, failed to reach the designated staging areas and, together with normal civilians, sustained significant casualties when public transport (trains and roads filled with refugees) became targets of the German Air Force.\n\nPoland possessed numerically inferior armoured forces, and they were dispersed within the infantry and unable to effectively engage in any major armoured battles. The Germans opposing them had close to 3,000 tanks organised into independent divisions under \"blitzkrieg\" doctrine. In terms of equipment, the Poles had 132 of their own 7TP tanks, which were capable of destroying any German armour, including their heaviest Panzer IV, and had a few relatively modern imported designs, such as 50 Renault R35 tanks and 38 Vickers E tanks. Of the 700 odd tanks remaining, 102 were obsolete First World War Renault FT tanks and, not much better than armoured cars, 300 TK-3 and 274 TKS tankettes. In addition to tanks, Poland successfully used 10 regular armoured trains against German forces, which were unprepared to face this kind of combat vehicle considered in 1939 so obsolete by German planners to be given any serious consideration. Although the trains proved indeed vulnerable to air attack, losses incurred against Polish trains (\"Śmiały\" Armored Train destroyed nearly 100 German tanks during the battles around Mokra village) convinced the Germans to reintroduce this type of vehicle into their own army after the September Campaign.\n\nExperience in the Polish-Soviet War (1919–1921), the only recent, major conflict the independent Second Polish Republic took part in, shaped Polish Army organisational and operational doctrine. Unlike the First World War, this was a conflict in which the cavalry's mobility played a decisive role. Thus the Polish high command drew a lesson different from both the Western Allies and Germany with their western front experience. With their victory in the First World War, France and Britain remained conservative and expected the new conflict to be another of trench warfare. German military theories were based upon the notion that successful offenses would be based on new inventions—tanks and planes. Poland stood in the middle: acknowledging the benefits of mobility but unwilling (and unable) to invest heavily in the expensive and unproven new inventions, it turned to cavalry, which the Polish Army considered its elite corps. During the September Campaign, the Polish Cavalry would prove to be much more successful than anybody, the Germans included, could have anticipated. Polish Cavalry brigades were used as a mobile infantry and were quite successful against German infantry. Cavalry charges were rare but successful, especially when used against infantry in un-entrenched positions. However, while Polish cavalry matched German panzers in speed and anti-infantry effectiveness, in the end it simply could not stand its ground against tanks.\n\nAmong the interesting equipment Polish forces used with success was the 7.92 mm Karabin przeciwpancerny wz.35 anti-tank rifle. It was quite successful against German light tanks, although, as with most of modern Polish equipment, production was just beginning when the war started, and thus wasn't fielded in numbers large enough to significantly change the outcome of the war.\n\nThe Polish Air Force was at a severe disadvantage against the Luftwaffe. Although its pilots were highly trained, the Polish Air Force lacked modern fighter aircraft, and the Germans had gross numerical superiority: Poland had approximately 400 modern and semi-modern aircraft (and another 400 obsolete transport, recon and training aircraft), including 169 fighters, and Germany had approximately 3,000 aircraft (albeit only half that number on the Polish front, with most of the remaining similarly as obsolete as the second 400 Polish aircraft). The Polish Air Force development program was slowed in 1926 in the aftermath of Józef Piłsudski's May coup d'état, as Piłsudski considered the air force to be of less importance than other military branches.\n\nIn 1939, the Polish main fighter, the PZL P.11, designed in the early 1930s, was becoming obsolete. The slightly better PZL P.24 was used solely for export, and PZL.50s and several other projects, which were supposed to have better parameters than contemporary German fighters, were still during prototype's tests. As a result, the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters were faster and better-armed than anything the Poles had in 1939, and most German bombers could also outrun the Polish fighters. On the other hand, P.11s were more maneuverable, and despite the German superiority in speed, armament and numbers, P.11s downed a considerable number of German aircraft, including fighters. The exact numbers are not verified, but some sources claim that at least one German aircraft was shot down for each P.11 lost (a figure of 107 to 141 German aircraft shot down for the loss of 118 Polish aircraft is most often given).\n\nOne of the most interesting units in the Polish Air Force arsenal was the PZL.37 Łoś twin-engine medium bomber. Before the war it was one of the world's most modern and outstanding bombers. Smaller than most contemporary medium bombers, it was still able to carry a heavier bomb load than comparable aircraft, including the famous Vickers Wellington. It was relatively fast and easy to handle, and thanks to a landing gear with double wheels, it could operate from rough fields or meadows. The only drawback was its relatively weak defensive armament, consisting of 3 machine guns. Its range was also limited, but the Łoś was not meant to be a long-range bomber. During the September Campaign, despite their good performance, they were too few in number to change the outcome and, often lacking fighter cover, sustained heavy losses, especially when used to attack armoured columns.\n\nFew Polish Air Force planes were destroyed on the ground as most had been deployed to temporary, secret airstrips. The fighter planes were grouped in 15 escadres. Five of them constituted the Pursuit Brigade (\"Brygada Pościgowa\"), deployed in the Warsaw area. The bombers, grouped in 9 escadres of the Bomber Brigade (\"Brygada Bombowa\"), attacked armoured columns, suffering heavy losses. Seven reconnaissance and 12 observation escadres, attached to various Polish Armies, were intensively used for reconnaissance. However, the Polish pilots, while highly trained and motivated, faced a numerically superior opponent in superior designs with a much better command structure. Germany achieved air superiority around day three of the campaign, although the Polish Air Force managed to remain operational for the first two weeks of the September Campaign. At that point, the Polish Air Force ceased to exist as a fighting force, as most of its planes were either destroyed in combat or, facing rapidly advancing German troops, had to be abandoned on the ground due to lack of supplies and spare parts. A few remaining aircraft were either captured by the Germans or withdrawn to Romania and taken over by that country. A great number of pilots and air crews managed to break through to France and later Britain through various routes.\n\nThe Polish Navy was a small fleet composed of destroyers and submarines. Most Polish surface units followed Operation Peking, leaving Polish ports on 20 August, evading German forces and escaping to the North Sea to join with the British Royal Navy. Submarine forces were participating in Operation Worek, with the goal of engaging and damaging German shipping in the Baltic Sea, but with much less success.\n\nIn addition, many ships of the Polish Merchant Navy joined the British merchant fleet and took part in various convoys during the war.\n\nNazi Germany and the Soviet Union had negotiated about the upcoming invasion of Poland prior to signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The Soviet Union had been promised half of Poland if they helped the Germans to conquer the country. In the event, the German invasion began on 1 September 1939 but the Soviet Union held back until 17 September. When the Soviets attacked, Polish forces were forming a bridgehead in south-eastern Poland where they intended to make a last stand against the Germans - and if overwhelmed, to cross the border into Romania and make their way to the west to continue the fight from there. The Soviet invasion of Poland not only wrecked this plan, but also forced the Polish government to leave the country.\n\nThe Polish government had relocated to the south-eastern town of Kuty on 17 September 1939 and held a cabinet meeting at 4pm, in full knowledge that Soviet forces were advancing rapidly towards them. It was concluded that they should cross the border into Romania, and from there go on to France. Most of Poland's highest government officials evacuated to Romania on the night of 17–18 September.\n\nThe Soviet invasion destroyed the possibility of any further coordinated military action by Poland against the Germans. Nevertheless, the Poles kept on fighting - the last significant battle which organised Polish forces took part in was at Kock, which ended on 6 October. The Polish government refused to surrender or negotiate a peace, and instead ordered all units to evacuate Poland with the aim of eventually reorganising in France. The Soviet invaders were met with only sporadic resistance, most notably in the Battle of Szack when Polish artillery wiped out an entire brigade of Soviet tanks. The Soviet Union lost 1,500 men during the invasion.\n\n\nSlovakia had an army at only six months old, but when Germany asked the Slovaks to help attack Poland, they agreed. They sent an army group, called Field Army Bernolák under the command of Slovak General Ferdinand Catlos.\nTheir campaign began on September first, 1939. They occupied the Polish town of Tatranska Javorina and several other Polish areas (which are still part of Slovakia today.) They only faced one Polish force, the Karpaty Army. At the end of their attack, they had occupied much of Southern Poland with the cost of only 37 men killed and 114 men wounded.\n\n"}

It is in the Gulf of Thailand off the coastline of the Thai province of Rayong, approximately southeast of Bangkok. Ko Samet is part of the Phe () Subdistrict of the Amphoe Mueang Rayong (, the capital district, or Amphoe Mueang), of Rayong Province. Ko Samet is the largest and westernmost of a cluster of islands not far from the coast. Ko Samet measures from north to south. At its closest point to the mainland, the island is south of mainland Rayong Province; however the actual travelling distance from the main commercial tourist pier in the town of Phe to the island's closest tourist beach is about .\n\nPopular with foreign tourists and as a weekend getaway for residents of nearby Bangkok, most of the island (excluding the Na Dan area) is in the Khao Laem Ya–Mu Ko Samet National Park. In 1981, the Royal Forest Department declared the archipelago of Samet, along with nine other small islands, the headland of Khao Laem Ya, and the Mae Ramphueng Beach to be a national park, and thus Ko Samet is under the protection of the National Parks Division of the Thai government.\n\nThe Thai government restricted overnight stay on the island until 1981 (even though Bangkokians had known of the beauty of Ko Samet for decades). In that year, on 1 October, the Forestry Department of Thailand declared Ko Samet and environs to be a national park.\n\nLocated 220 km from the capital in the Gulf of Thailand, Ko Samet is approximately in size, and shaped somewhat like the letter \"t\". Along the length of the \"t\" (north-south) the island measures approximately 7 km, and measures 4 km across the \"t\" (west-east). Forests blanket up to 80 percent of the total area.\n\nClosest to the mainland, lies the small island port village of Na Dan, commonly known as Ko Samet Village, with its nearby beach, Hat Sai Kaeo (Glass Sand Beach; ), the longest beach on Ko Samet. Most of Ko Samet's beaches lie along the eastern shore of the island. Other beaches on the island include: Ao Phai, Ao Wai, Ao Kio Na Nai, Ao Cho, Ao Kio Na Nok, Ao Wong Duean, Cape Kut, Ao Toei, and Ao Karang at the southern tip, and Ao Phrao on the western shore of the island. Just off the southern tip of the island are three small rock-islands, Ko Chan (Moon Island; ), Ko San Chalam (Shark Fin Island), and Hin Khao (White Rock; ).\n\nKo Samet is one of the driest archipelagos in Thailand. Ko Samet gets significantly less rainfall than Rayong Province, even though it is only a few kilometres offshore. The island's \"rainy season\" extends only from May to July, but even during this season it has less rain than other islands in Thailand. The island, despite being arid, consists of lush forested hills, covered with evergreen and deciduous forest and cajeput trees grow abundantly (the name \"samet\" means \"cajeput\"). Owing to the lack of rain, Ko Samet must import potable water from the mainland.\n\nKo Samet is administered by the Phe Sub-district, Mueang Rayong District, Rayong Province. Ko Samet is also under the aegis of the national park area (Khao Laem Ya–Mu Ko Samet National Park), and all foreign visitors are required to pay a 200 baht (approximately US$5.60) entry fee upon arrival.\n\nThere are two main arteries on Ko Samet: the northern route connects Hat Sai Kaeo to Ao Klang and Ao Noina. The central route consists of four smaller roads. The first road links Sai Kaeo beach to Ao Phai and Ao Phutsa. The second road connects the center of island to Ao Wong Duean. The third road connects the first road to Ao Thapthim and Ao Nuan. The fourth road connects the first road to Ao Phrao.\n\nSongthaews are the chief means of public transport.\n\nThere are five piers: Ao Klang, Ao Phrao, Ao Wong Duean, Ao Thian, and Ao Wai. Ao Klang Pier is the port to mainland. The rest are piers for diving and excursions.\n\nDuring the 19th century the poet Sunthorn Phu (1786–1855), set part of his epic work, \"Phra Aphai Mani\" (sometimes transliterated as \"Pra Apaimanee\"), on the shores of the island. Statues of the title character, Prince Aphai Mani and the siren/mermaid which guided him to Ko Samet can be found on Hat Sai Kaeo Beach.\n\n\n"}

The Congregation for Catholic Education retains responsibility for matters pertaining to the structure of seminary curricula in philosophy and theology, in consultation with the Congregation for the Clergy.\n\nPope Sixtus V created the forerunner of the Congregation in 1588 with the Constitution \"Immensa,\" to oversee the University of Rome La Sapienza and other notable universities of the time, including Bologna, Paris, and Salamanca. In 1824 Pope Leo XII created the \"Congregatio studiorum\" for educational institutions in the Papal States, which in 1870 began to oversee Catholic universities. Pope Saint Pius X confirmed this responsibility in 1908 and Pope Benedict XV erected in 1915 the section for seminaries (which existed within the Consistorial Congregation), joined to it the \"Congregatio studiorum,\" and called it \"Congregatio de Seminariis et Studiorum Universitatibus.\" In 1967, Pope Paul VI renamed it \"Sacra Congregatio pro institutione Catholica.\" The present name \"Congregation for Catholic Education (Institutes of Study)\" derives from Pope John Paul II's 1988 Apostolic Constitution \"Pastor Bonus\".\n\nTo fulfill its mission, this congregation has two offices:\n\n1.

At the 2016 census, Kingston SE had a population of 1,648.\n\nKingston, South Australia was established in the 1800s by Archibald, his brother James Cooke and James' wife Mrs. Mary Macpherson Cooke. Much later a Sir George Strickland Kingston, a South Australian politician, surveyor and architect was chosen, for the co-incidence of his name, to open the Kingston Post Office on 9 February 1869. The extension on its name is to distinguish Kingston in the South East (of South Australia) from another 'Kingston' in the state which is now officially named \"Kingston On Murray\". The extension was added in July 1940. The present-day town of Kingston SE includes the original Kingston, as well as the towns of Port Caroline and Maria Creek.\n\nThe town was connected to Naracoorte by a railway known as the Kingston-Naracoorte railway in 1876, providing a port for the grain and wool grown away from the coast. The rails were converted to broad gauge with a new station built on the edge of town in 1959. The railway closed on 28 November 1987 then was dismantled on 15 September 1991.\n\nThe region was formerly serviced by two newspapers: the Kingston Weekly, the newspaper of The Kingston Traders' Association, was issued between 22 March 1946 and 30 March 1951.

{"id": "1918188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918188", "title": "Galley", "text": "Galley\n\nGalleys were the warships used by the early Mediterranean naval powers, including the Greeks, Illyrians, Phoenicians, and Romans. They remained the dominant types of vessels used for war and piracy in the Mediterranean Sea until the last decades of the 16th century. As warships, galleys carried various types of weapons throughout their long existence, including rams, catapults, and cannons, but also relied on their large crews to overpower enemy vessels in boarding actions. They were the first ships to effectively use heavy cannons as anti-ship weapons. As highly efficient gun platforms, they forced changes in the design of medieval seaside fortresses as well as refinement of sailing warships.\n\nThe zenith of galley usage in warfare came in the late 16th century with battles like that at Lepanto in 1571, one of the largest naval battles ever fought. By the 17th century, however, sailing ships and hybrid ships like the xebec displaced galleys in naval warfare. They were the most common warships in the Atlantic Ocean during the Middle Ages, and later saw limited use in the Caribbean, the Philippines, and the Indian Ocean in the early modern period, mostly as patrol craft to combat pirates. From the mid-16th century galleys were in intermittent use in the Baltic Sea, with its short distances and extensive archipelagoes. There was a minor revival of galley warfare in the 18th century in the wars among Russia, Sweden, and Denmark.\n\nThe term \"galley\" derives from the Medieval Greek \"galea\", a smaller version of the dromon, the prime warship of the Byzantine navy. The origin of the Greek word is unclear but could possibly be related to \"galeos\", dogfish shark. The word \"galley\" has been attested in English from c. 1300 and has been used in most European languages from around 1500 both as a general term for oared warships, and from the Middle Ages and onward more specifically for the Mediterranean-style vessel.\nIt was only from the 16th century that a unified galley concept came in use. Before that, particularly in antiquity, there was a wide variety of terms used for different types of galleys. In modern historical literature, \"galley\" is occasionally used as a general term for various types of oared vessels larger than boats, though the \"true\" galley is defined as the ships belonging to the Mediterranean tradition.\nAncient galleys were named according to the number of oars, the number of banks of oars or lines of rowers. The terms are based on contemporary language use combined with more recent compounds of Greek and Latin words. The earliest Greek single-banked galleys are called triaconters (from \"triakontoroi\", \"thirty-oars\") and penteconters (\"pentēkontoroi\", \"fifty-oars\"). For later galleys with more than one row of oars, the terminology is based on Latin numerals with the suffix \"-reme\" from \"rēmus\", \"oar\". A \"monoreme\" has one bank of oars, a \"bireme\" two, and a \"trireme\" three. Since the maximum banks of oars was three, any expansion above that did not refer to additional banks of oars, but of additional rowers for every oar. \"Quinquereme\" (\"quintus\" + \"rēmus\") was literally a \"five-oar\", but actually meant that there were several rowers to certain banks of oars which made up five lines of oar handlers. For simplicity, they have by many modern scholars been referred to as \"fives\", \"sixes\", \"eights\", \"elevens\", etc. Anything above six or seven rows of rowers was not common, though even a very exceptional \"forty\" is attested in contemporary source. Any galley with more than three or four lines of rowers is often referred to as a \"polyreme\".\n\nArchaeologist Lionel Casson has used the term \"galley\" to describe all North European shipping in the Early and High Middle Ages, including Viking merchants and even their famous longships, though this is rare. Oared military vessels built on the British Isles in the 11th to 13th centuries were based on Scandinavian designs, but were nevertheless referred to as \"galleys\". Many of them were similar to birlinns, close relatives of longship types like the \"snekkja\". By the 14th century, they were replaced with balingers in southern Britain while longship-type \"Irish galleys\" remained in use throughout the Middle Ages in northern Britain.\nMedieval and early modern galleys used a different terminology from their ancient predecessors. Names were based on the changing designs that evolved after the ancient rowing schemes were forgotten. Among the most important is the Byzantine dromon, the predecessor to the Italian \"galea sottila\". This was the first step toward the final form of the Mediterranean war galley. As galleys became an integral part of an advanced, early modern system of warfare and state administration, they were divided into a number of ranked grades based on the size of the vessel and the number of its crew. The most basic types were the following: large commander \"lantern galleys\", half-galleys, galiots, fustas, brigantines, and \"fregatas\". Naval historian Jan Glete has described as a sort of predecessor of the later rating system of the Royal Navy and other sailing fleets in Northern Europe.\n\nThe French navy and the British Royal Navy built a series of \"galley frigates\" from c. 1670–1690 that were small two-decked sailing cruisers with a set of oarports on the lower deck. The three British galley frigates also had distinctive names – \"James Galley\", \"Charles Galley\", and \"Mary Galley\". In the late 18th century, the term \"galley\" was in some contexts used to describe minor oared gun-armed vessels which did not fit into the category of the classic Mediterranean type. In North America, during American Revolutionary War and other wars with France and Britain, the early US Navy and other navies built vessels that were called \"galleys\" or \"row galleys\", though they were actually brigantines or Baltic gunboats. This type of description was more a characterization of their military role, and was in part due to technicalities in administration and naval financing.\n\nAmong the earliest known watercraft were canoes made from hollowed-out logs, the earliest ancestors of galleys. Their narrow hulls required them to be paddled in a fixed sitting position facing forward, a less efficient form of propulsion than rowing with proper oars, facing backward. Seagoing paddled craft have been attested by finds of terracotta sculptures and lead models in the region of the Aegean Sea from the 3rd millennium BC. However, archaeologists believe that the Stone Age colonization of islands in the Mediterranean around 8,000 BC required fairly large, seaworthy vessels that were paddled and possibly even equipped with sails. The first evidence of more complex craft that are considered to prototypes for later galleys comes from Ancient Egypt during the Old Kingdom (c. 2700–2200 BC). Under the rule of pharaoh Pepi I (2332–2283 BC) these vessels were used to transport troops to raid settlements along the Levantine coast and to ship back slaves and timber. During the reign of Hatshepsut (c. 1479–57 BC), Egyptian galleys traded in luxuries on the Red Sea with the enigmatic Land of Punt, as recorded on wall paintings at the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari.\nShipbuilders, probably Phoenician, a seafaring people who lived on the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, were the first to create the two-level galley that would be widely known under its Greek name, \"diērēs\", or bireme. Even though the Phoenicians were among the most important naval civilizations in early classical antiquity, little detailed evidence have been found concerning the types of ships they used. The best depictions found so far have been small, highly stylized images on seals which depict crescent-shape vessels equipped with one mast and banks of oars. Colorful frescoes on the Minoan settlement on Santorini (c. 1600 BC) show more detailed pictures of vessels with ceremonial tents on deck in a procession. Some of these are rowed, but others are paddled with men laboriously bent over the railings. This has been interpreted as a possible ritual reenactment of more ancient types of vessels, alluding to a time before rowing was invented, but little is otherwise known about the use and design of Minoan ships.\n\nIn the earliest days of the galley, there was no clear distinction between ships of trade and war other than their actual usage. River boats plied the waterways of ancient Egypt during the Old Kingdom (2700–2200 BC) and seagoing galley-like vessels were recorded bringing back luxuries from across the Red Sea in the reign of pharaoh Hatshepsut. Fitting rams to the bows of vessels sometime around the 8th century BC resulted in a distinct split in the design of warships, and set trade vessels apart, at least when it came to use in naval warfare. The Phoenicians used galleys for transports that were less elongated, carried fewer oars and relied more on sails. Carthaginian galley wrecks found off Sicily that date to the 3rd or 2nd century BC had a length to breadth ratio of 6:1, proportions that fell between the 4:1 of sailing merchant ships and the 8:1 or 10:1 of war galleys. Merchant galleys in the ancient Mediterranean were intended as carriers of valuable cargo or perishable goods that needed to be moved as safely and quickly as possible.\nThe first Greek galleys appeared around the second half of the 2nd millennium BC. In the epic poem, the \"Iliad\", set in the 12th century BC, galleys with a single row of oarsmen were used primarily to transport soldiers to and from various land battles. The first recorded naval battle, the Battle of the Delta between Egyptian forces under Ramesses III and the enigmatic alliance known as the Sea Peoples, occurred as early as 1175 BC. It is the first known engagement between organized armed forces, using sea vessels as weapons of war, though primarily as fighting platforms. It was distinguished by being fought against an anchored fleet close to shore with land-based archer support.\n\nThe first true Mediterranean galleys usually had between 15 and 25 pairs of oars and were called triaconters or penteconters, literally \"thirty-\" and \"fifty-oared\", respectively. Not long after they appeared, a third row of oars was added by the addition to a bireme of an outrigger, a projecting construction that gave more room for the projecting oars. These new galleys were called \"triērēs\" (\"three-fitted\") in Greek. The Romans later called this design the \"triremis\", trireme, the name it is today best known under. It has been hypothesized that early types of triremes existed as early as 700 BC, but the earliest conclusive literary reference dates to 542 BC. With the development of triremes, penteconters disappeared altogether. Triaconters were still used, but only for scouting and express dispatches.\n\nThe earliest use for galleys in warfare was to ferry fighters from one place to another, and until the middle of the 2nd millennium BC had no real distinction from merchant freighters. Around the 14th century BC, the first dedicated fighting ships were developed, sleeker and with cleaner lines than the bulkier merchants. They were used for raiding, capturing merchants and for dispatches. During this early period, raiding became the most important form of organized violence in the Mediterranean region. Maritime classicist historian Lionel Casson used the example of Homer's works to show that seaborne raiding was considered a common and legitimate occupation among ancient maritime peoples. The later Athenian historian Thucydides described it as having been \"without stigma\" before his time.\n\nThe development of the ram sometime before the 8th century BC changed the nature of naval warfare, which had until then been a matter of boarding and hand-to-hand fighting. With a heavy projection at the foot of the bow, sheathed with metal, usually bronze, a ship could incapacitate an enemy ship by punching a hole in its planking. The relative speed and nimbleness of ships became important, since a slower ship could be outmaneuvered and disabled by a faster one. The earliest designs had only one row of rowers that sat in undecked hulls, rowing against tholes, or oarports, that were placed directly along the railings. The practical upper limit for wooden constructions fast and maneuverable enough for warfare was around 25–30 oars per side. By adding another level of oars, a development that occurred no later than c. 750 BC, the galley could be made shorter with as many rowers, while making them strong enough to be effective ramming weapons.\n\nThe emergence of more advanced states and intensified competition between them spurred on the development of advanced galleys with multiple banks of rowers. During the middle of the first millennium BC, the Mediterranean powers developed successively larger and more complex vessels, the most advanced being the classical trireme with up to 170 rowers. Triremes fought several important engagements in the naval battles of the Greco-Persian Wars (502–449 BC) and the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), including the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC, which sealed the defeat of Athens by Sparta and its allies. The trireme was an advanced ship that was expensive to build and to maintain due its large crew. By the 5th century, advanced war galleys had been developed that required sizable states with an advanced economy to build and maintain. It was associated with the latest in warship technology around the 4th century BC and could only be employed by an advanced state with an advanced economy and administration. They required considerable skill to row and oarsmen were mostly free citizens who had years of experience at the oar.\n\nAs civilizations around the Mediterranean grew in size and complexity, both their navies and the galleys that made up their numbers became successively larger. The basic design of two or three rows of oars remained the same, but more rowers were added to each oar. The exact reasons are not known, but are believed to have been caused by addition of more troops and the use of more advanced ranged weapons on ships, such as catapults. The size of the new naval forces also made it difficult to find enough skilled rowers for the one-man-per-oar system of the earliest triremes. With more than one man per oar, a single rower could set the pace for the others to follow, meaning that more unskilled rowers could be employed.\n\nThe successor states of Alexander the Great's empire built galleys that were like triremes or biremes in oar layout, but manned with additional rowers for each oar. The ruler Dionysius I of Syracuse (ca. 432–367 BC) is credited with pioneering the \"five\" and \"six\", meaning five or six rows of rowers plying two or three rows of oars. Ptolemy II (283–46 BC) is known to have built a large fleet of very large galleys with several experimental designs rowed by everything from 12 up to 40 rows of rowers, though most of these are considered to have been quite impractical. Fleets with large galleys were put in action in conflicts such as the Punic Wars (246–146 BC) between the Roman Republic and Carthage, which included massive naval battles with hundreds of vessels and tens of thousands of soldiers, seamen, and rowers.\n\nMost of the surviving documentary evidence comes from Greek and Roman shipping, though it is likely that merchant galleys all over the Mediterranean were highly similar. In Greek they were referred to as \"histiokopos\" (\"sail-oar-er\") to reflect that they relied on both types of propulsion. In Latin they were called \"actuaria (navis)\" (\"ship that moves\"), stressing that they were capable of making progress regardless of weather conditions. As an example of the speed and reliability, during an instance of the famous \"Carthago delenda est\" speech, Cato the Elder demonstrated the close proximity of the Roman arch enemy Carthage by displaying a fresh fig to his audience that he claimed had been picked in North Africa only three days past. Other cargoes carried by galleys were honey, cheese, meat, and live animals intended for gladiator combat. The Romans had several types of merchant galleys that specialized in various tasks, out of which the \"actuaria\" with up to 50 rowers was the most versatile, including the \"phaselus\" (lit. \"bean pod\") for passenger transport and the \"lembus\", a small-scale express carrier. Many of these designs continued to be used until the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Battle of Actium in 31 BC between the forces of Augustus and Mark Antony marked the peak of the Roman fleet arm. After Augustus' victory at Actium, most of the Roman fleet was dismantled and burned. The Roman civil wars were fought mostly by land forces, and from the 160s until the 4th century AD, no major fleet actions were recorded. During this time, most of the galley crews were disbanded or employed for entertainment purposes in mock battles or in handling the sail-like sun-screens in the larger Roman arenas. What fleets remained were treated as auxiliaries of the land forces, and galley crewmen themselves called themselves \"milites\", \"soldiers\", rather than \"nautae\", \"sailors\".\n\nThe Roman galley fleets were turned into provincial patrol forces that were smaller and relied largely on \"liburnians\", compact biremes with 25 pairs of oars. These were named after an Illyrian tribe known by Romans for their sea roving practices, and these smaller craft were based on, or inspired by, their vessels of choice. The liburnians and other small galleys patrolled the rivers of continental Europe and reached as far as the Baltic, where they were used to fight local uprisings and assist in checking foreign invasions. The Romans maintained numerous bases around the empire: along the rivers of Central Europe, chains of forts along the northern European coasts and the British Isles, Mesopotamia, and North Africa, including Trabzon, Vienna, Belgrade, Dover, Seleucia, and Alexandria. Few actual galley battles in the provinces are found in records. One action in 70 AD at the unspecified location of the \"Island of the Batavians\" during the Batavian Rebellion was recorded, and included a trireme as the Roman flagship. The last provincial fleet, the \"classis Britannica\", was reduced by the late 200s, though there was a minor upswing under the rule of Constantine (272–337). His rule also saw the last major naval battle of the unified Roman Empire (before the permanent split into Western and Eastern [later \"Byzantine\"] Empires), the Battle of Hellespont of 324. Some time after Hellespont, the classical trireme fell out of use, and its design was forgotten.\nA transition from galley to sailing vessels as the most common types of warships began in the High Middle Ages (c. 11th century). Large high-sided sailing ships had always been formidable obstacles for galleys. To low-freeboard oared vessels, the bulkier sailing ships, the cog and the carrack, were almost like floating fortresses, being difficult to board and even harder to capture. Galleys remained useful as warships throughout the entire Middle Ages because of their maneuverability. Sailing ships of the time had only one mast, usually with just a single, large square sail. This made them cumbersome to steer and it was virtually impossible to sail into the wind direction. Galleys therefore were still the only ship type capable of coastal raiding and amphibious landings, both key elements of medieval warfare.\n\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, the Byzantine Empire struggled with the incursion from invading Muslim Arabs from the 7th century, leading to fierce competition, a buildup of fleet, and war galleys of increasing size. Soon after conquering Egypt and the Levant, the Arab rulers built ships highly similar to Byzantine dromons with the help of local Coptic shipwrights from former Byzantine naval bases. By the 9th century, the struggle between the Byzantines and Arabs had turned the Eastern Mediterranean into a no-man's land for merchant activity. In the 820s Crete was captured by Andalusian Muslims displaced by a failed revolt against the Emirate of Cordoba, turning the island into a base for (galley) attacks on Christian shipping until the island was recaptured by the Byzantines in 960.\n\nIn the western Mediterranean and Atlantic, the division of the Carolingian Empire in the late 9th century brought on a period of instability, meaning increased piracy and raiding in the Mediterranean, particularly by newly arrived Muslim invaders. The situation was worsened by raiding Scandinavian Vikings who used longships, vessels that in many ways were very close to galleys in design and functionality and also employed similar tactics. To counter the threat, local rulers began to build large oared vessels, some with up to 30 pairs of oars, that were larger, faster, and with higher sides than Viking ships. Scandinavian expansion, including incursions into the Mediterranean and attacks on both Muslim Iberia and even Constantinople itself, subsided by the mid-11th century. By this time, greater stability in merchant traffic was achieved by the emergence of Christian kingdoms such as those of France, Hungary, and Poland. Around the same time, Italian port towns and city states, like Venice, Pisa, and Amalfi, rose on the fringes of the Byzantine Empire as it struggled with eastern threats.\n\nAfter the advent of Islam and Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th century, the old Mediterranean economy collapsed and the volume of trade went down drastically. The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, neglected to revive overland trade routes but was dependent on keeping the sea lanes open to keep the empire together. Bulk trade fell around 600–750 while the luxury trade increased. Galleys remained in service, but were profitable mainly in the luxury trade, which set off their high maintenance cost. In the 10th century, there was a sharp increase in piracy which resulted in larger ships with more numerous crews. These were mostly built by the growing city-states of Italy which were emerging as the dominant sea powers, including Venice, Genoa, and Pisa. Inheriting the Byzantine ship designs, the new merchant galleys were similar dromons, but without any heavy weapons and both faster and wider. They could be manned by crews of up to 1,000 men and were employed in both trade and warfare. A further boost to the development of the large merchant galleys was the upswing in Western European pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land.\nIn Northern Europe, Viking longships and their derivations, knarrs, dominated trading and shipping, though developed separately from the Mediterranean galley tradition.\nIn the South, galleys continued to be useful for trade even as sailing vessels evolved more efficient hulls and rigging; since they could hug the shoreline and make steady progress when winds failed, they were highly reliable. The zenith in the design of merchant galleys came with the state-owned \"great galleys\" of the Venetian Republic, first built in the 1290s. These were used to carry the lucrative trade in luxuries from the east such as spices, silks, and gems. They were in all respects larger than contemporary war galleys (up to 46 m) and had a deeper draft, with more room for cargo (140–250 t). With a full complement of rowers ranging from 150 to 180 men, all available to defend the ship from attack, they were also very safe modes of travel. This attracted a business of carrying affluent pilgrims to the Holy Land, a trip that could be accomplished in as little 29 days on the route Venice-Jaffa, despite landfalls for rest and watering or for respite from rough weather.\n\nLate medieval maritime warfare was divided in two distinct regions. In the Mediterranean galleys were used for raiding along coasts, and in the constant fighting for naval bases. In the Atlantic and Baltic there was greater focus on sailing ships that were used mostly for troop transport, with galleys providing fighting support. Galleys were still widely used in the north and were the most numerous warships used by Mediterranean powers with interests in the north, especially the French and Iberian kingdoms.\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th century, the galley evolved into the design that was to remain essentially the same until it was phased out in the early 19th century. The new type descended from the ships used by Byzantine and Muslim fleets in the Early Middle Ages. These were the mainstay of all Christian powers until the 14th century, including the great maritime republics of Genoa and Venice, the Papacy, the Hospitallers, Aragon, and Castile, as well as by various pirates and corsairs. The overall term used for these types of vessels was \"gallee sottili\" (\"slender galleys\"). The later Ottoman navy used similar designs, but they were generally faster under sail, and smaller, but slower under oars. Galley designs were intended solely for close action with hand-held weapons and projectile weapons like bows and crossbows. In the 13th century the Iberian Crown of Aragon built several fleet of galleys with high castles, manned with Catalan crossbowmen, and regularly defeated numerically superior Angevin forces.\n\nFrom the first half of the 14th century the Venetian \"galere da mercato\" (\"merchantman galleys\") were being built in the shipyards of the state-run Arsenal as \"a combination of state enterprise and private association, the latter being a kind of consortium of export merchants\", as Fernand Braudel described them. The ships sailed in convoy, defended by archers and slingsmen (\"ballestieri\") aboard, and later carrying cannons. In Genoa, the other major maritime power of the time, galleys and ships in general were more produced by smaller private ventures.\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries merchant galleys traded high-value goods and carried passengers. Major routes in the time of the early Crusades carried the pilgrim traffic to the Holy Land. Later routes linked ports around the Mediterranean, between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea (a grain trade soon squeezed off by the Turkish capture of Constantinople, 1453) and between the Mediterranean and Bruges— where the first Genoese galley arrived at Sluys in 1277, the first Venetian \"galere\" in 1314— and Southampton. Although primarily sailing vessels, they used oars to enter and leave many trading ports of call, the most effective way of entering and leaving the Lagoon of Venice. The Venetian \"galera\", beginning at 100 tons and built as large as 300, was not the largest merchantman of its day, when the Genoese carrack of the 15th century might exceed 1000 tons. In 1447, for instance, Florentine galleys planned to call at 14 ports on their way to and from Alexandria. The availability of oars enabled these ships to navigate close to the shore where they could exploit land and sea breezes and coastal currents, to work reliable and comparatively fast passages against the prevailing wind. The large crews also provided protection against piracy. These ships were very seaworthy; a Florentine great galley left Southampton on 23 February 1430 and returned to its port at Pisa in 32 days. They were so safe that merchandise was often not insured. These ships increased in size during this period, and were the template from which the galleass developed.\n\nAs early as 1304 the type of ship required by the Danish defence organization changed from galley to cog, a flat-bottomed sailing ship.\n\nDuring the early 15th century, sailing ships began to dominate naval warfare in northern waters. While the galley still remained the primary warship in southern waters, a similar transition had begun also among the Mediterranean powers. A Castilian naval raid on the island of Jersey in 1405 became the first recorded battle where a Mediterranean power employed a naval force consisting mostly of cogs or nefs, rather than the oared-powered galleys. The Battle of Gibraltar between Castile and Portugal in 1476 was another important sign of change; it was the first recorded battle where the primary combatants were full-rigged ships armed with wrought-iron guns on the upper decks and in the waists, foretelling of the slow decline of the war galley.\n\nThe transition from the Mediterranean war galley to the sailing vessel as the preferred method of vessel in the Mediterranean is tied directly to technological developments and the inherent handling characteristics of each vessel types. The primary factors were changing sail design, the introduction of cannons aboard vessels, and the handling characteristics of the vessels.\n\nThe sailing vessel was always at the mercy of the wind for propulsion, and those that did carry oars were placed at a disadvantage because they were not optimized for oar use. The galley did have disadvantages compared to the sailing vessel though. Their smaller hulls were not able to hold as much cargo and this limited their range as the crews were required to replenish food stuffs more frequently. The low freeboard of the galley meant that in close action with a sailing vessel, the sailing vessel would usually maintain a height advantage. The sailing vessel could also fight more effectively farther out at sea and in rougher wind conditions because of the height of their freeboard.\n\nUnder sail, an oared warship was placed at much greater risk as a result of the piercings for the oars which were required to be near the waterline and would allow water to ingress into the galley if the vessel heeled too far to one side. These advantages and disadvantages led the galley to be and remain a primarily coastal vessel. The shift to sailing vessels in the Mediterranean was the result of the negation of some of the galley's advantages as well as the adoption of gunpowder weapons on a much larger institutional scale. The sailing vessel was propelled in a different manner than the galley but the tactics were often the same until the 16th century. The real-estate afforded to the sailing vessel to place larger cannons and other armament mattered little because early gunpowder weapons had limited range and were expensive to produce. The eventual creation of cast iron cannons allowed vessels and armies to be outfitted much more cheaply. The cost of gunpowder also fell in this period.\n\nThe armament of both vessel types varied between larger weapons such as bombards and the smaller swivel guns. For logistical purposes it became convenient for those with larger shore establishments to standardize upon a given size of cannon. Traditionally the English in the North and the Venetians in the Mediterranean are seen as some the earliest to move in this direction. The improving sail rigs of northern vessels also allowed them to navigate in the coastal waters of the Mediterranean to a much larger degree than before. Aside from warships the decrease in the cost of gunpowder weapons also led to the arming of merchants. The larger vessels of the north continued to mature while the galley retained its defining characteristics. Attempts were made to stave this off such as the addition of fighting castles in the bow, but such additions to counter the threats brought by larger sailing vessels often offset the advantages of galley.\n\nFrom around 1450, three major naval powers established a dominance over different parts of the Mediterranean using galleys as their primary weapons at sea: the Ottomans in the east, Venice in the center and Habsburg Spain in the west. The core of their fleets were concentrated in the three major, wholly dependable naval bases in the Mediterranean: Constantinople, Venice, and Barcelona. Naval warfare in the 16th century Mediterranean was fought mostly on a smaller scale, with raiding and minor actions dominating. Only three truly major fleet engagements were actually fought in the 16th century: the battles of Preveza in 1538, Djerba in 1560, and Lepanto in 1571. Lepanto became the last large all-galley battle ever, and was also one of the largest battle in terms of participants anywhere in early modern Europe before the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nOccasionally the Mediterranean powers employed galley forces for conflicts outside the Mediterranean. Spain sent galley squadrons to the Netherlands during the later stages of the Eighty Years' War which successfully operated against Dutch forces in the enclosed, shallow coastal waters. From the late 1560s, galleys were also used to transport silver to Genoese bankers to finance Spanish troops against the Dutch uprising. Galleasses and galleys were part of an invasion force of over 16,000 men that conquered the Azores in 1583. Around 2,000 galley rowers were on board ships of the famous 1588 Spanish Armada, though few of these actually made it to the battle itself. Outside European and Middle Eastern waters, Spain built galleys to deal with pirates and privateers in both the Caribbean and the Philippines. Ottoman galleys contested the Portuguese intrusion in the Indian Ocean in the 16th century, but failed against the high-sided, massive Portuguese carracks in open waters.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire attempted to contest the Portuguese rise to power in the Indian Ocean in the 16th century with Mediterranean-style galleys, but were foiled by the powerful Portuguese ocean-going sailing carracks. Even though the carracks themselves were soon surpassed by other types of sailing vessels, their greater range, great size, and high superstructures, armed with numerous wrought iron guns easily outmatched the short-ranged, low-freeboard Turkish galleys. The Spanish used galleys to more success in their colonial possessions in the Caribbean and the Philippines to hunt pirates and were used sporadically in the Netherlands and the Bay of Biscay. Spain maintained four permanent galley squadrons to guard its coasts and trade routes against the Ottomans, the French, and their corsairs. Together they formed the largest galley navy in the Mediterranean in the early 17th century. They formed the backbone of the Spanish Mediterranean war fleet and were used for ferrying troops, supplies, horses, and munitions to Spain's Italian and African possessions.\nGalleys had been synonymous with warships in the Mediterranean for at least 2,000 years, and continued to fulfill that role with the invention of gunpowder and heavy artillery. Though early 20th-century historians often dismissed the galleys as hopelessly outclassed with the first introduction of naval artillery on sailing ships, it was the galley that was favored by the introduction of heavy naval guns. Galleys were a more \"mature\" technology with long-established tactics and traditions of supporting social institutions and naval organizations. In combination with the intensified conflicts this led to a substantial increase in the size of galley fleets from c. 1520–80, above all in the Mediterranean, but also in other European theatres. Galleys and similar oared vessels remained uncontested as the most effective gun-armed warships in theory until the 1560s, and in practice for a few decades more, and were actually considered a grave risk to sailing warships. They could effectively fight other galleys, attack sailing ships in calm weather or in unfavorable winds (or deny them action if needed) and act as floating siege batteries. They were also unequaled in their amphibious capabilities, even at extended ranges, as exemplified by French interventions as far north as Scotland in the mid-16th century.\n\nHeavy artillery on galleys was mounted in the bow, which aligned easily with the long-standing tactical tradition of attacking head on, bow first. The ordnance on galleys was heavy from its introduction in the 1480s, and capable of quickly demolishing the high, thin medieval stone walls that still prevailed in the 16th century. This temporarily upended the strength of older seaside fortresses, which had to be rebuilt to cope with gunpowder weapons. The addition of guns also improved the amphibious abilities of galleys as they could make assaults supported with heavy firepower, and were even more effectively defended when beached stern-first. An accumulation and generalizing of bronze cannons and small firearms in the Mediterranean during the 16th century increased the cost of warfare, but also made those dependent on them more resilient to manpower losses. Older ranged weapons, like bows or even crossbows, required considerable skill to handle, sometimes a lifetime of practice, while gunpowder weapons required considerably less training to use successfully. According to a highly influential study by military historian John F. Guilmartin, this transition in warfare, along with the introduction of much cheaper cast iron guns in the 1580s, proved the \"death knell\" for the war galley as a significant military vessel. Gunpowder weapons began to displace men as the fighting power of armed forces, making individual soldiers more deadly and effective. As offensive weapons, firearms could be stored for years with minimal maintenance and did not require the expenses associated with soldiers. Manpower could thus be exchanged for capital investments, something which benefited sailing vessels that were already far more economical in their use of manpower. It also served to increase their strategic range and to out-compete galleys as fighting ships.\n\nAtlantic-style warfare based on heavily armed sailing ships began to change the nature of naval warfare in the Mediterranean in the 17th century. In 1616, a small Spanish squadron of five galleons and a patache was used to cruise the eastern Mediterranean and defeated a fleet of 55 galleys at the Battle of Cape Celidonia. By 1650, war galleys were used primarily in the wars between Venice and the Ottoman Empire in their struggle for strategic island and coastal trading bases and until the 1720s by both France and Spain but for largely amphibious and cruising operations or in combination with heavy sailing ships in a major battle, where they played specialized roles. An example of this was when a Spanish fleet used its galleys in a mixed naval/amphibious battle in the second 1641 battle of Tarragona, to break a French naval blockade and land troops and supplies. Even the Venetians, Ottomans, and other Mediterranean powers began to build Atlantic style warships for use in the Mediterranean in the latter part of the century. Christian and Muslim corsairs had been using galleys in sea roving and in support of the major powers in times of war, but largely replaced them with xebecs, various sail/oar hybrids, and a few remaining light galleys in the early 17th century.\n\nNo large all-galley battles were fought after the gigantic clash at Lepanto in 1571, and galleys were mostly used as cruisers or for supporting sailing warships as a rearguard in fleet actions, similar to the duties performed by frigates outside the Mediterranean. They could assist damaged ships out of the line, but generally only in very calm weather, as was the case at the Battle of Málaga in 1704. For small states and principalities as well as groups of private merchants, galleys were more affordable than large and complex sailing warships, and were used as defense against piracy. Galleys required less timber to build, the design was relatively simple and they carried fewer guns. They were tactically flexible and could be used for naval ambushes as well amphibious operations. They also required few skilled seamen and were difficult for sailing ships to catch, but vital in hunting down catching other galleys and oared raiders.\n\nAmong the largest galley fleets in the 17th century were operated by the two major Mediterranean powers, France and Spain. France had by the 1650s become the most powerful state in Europe, and expanded its galley forces under the rule of the absolutist \"Sun King\" Louis XIV. In the 1690s the French galley corps (\"corps des galères\") reached its all-time peak with more than 50 vessels manned by over 15,000 men and officers, becoming the largest galley fleet in the world at the time. Though there was intense rivalry between France and Spain, not a single galley battle occurred between the two great powers during this period, and virtually no naval battles between other nations either. During the War of the Spanish Succession, French galleys were involved in actions against Antwerp and Harwich, but due to the intricacies of alliance politics there were never any Franco-Spanish galley clashes. In the first half of the 18th century, the other major naval powers in the Mediterranean Sea, the Order of Saint John based in Malta, and of the Papal States in central Italy, cut down drastically on their galley forces. Despite the lack of action, the galley corps received vast resources (25–50% of the French naval expenditures) during the 1660s. It was maintained as a functional fighting force right up until its abolishment in 1748, though its primary function was more of a symbol of Louis XIV's absolutist ambitions.\nThe last recorded battle in the Mediterranean where galleys played a significant part was at Matapan in 1717, between the Ottomans and Venice and its allies, though they had little influence on the final outcome. Few large-scale naval battles were fought in the Mediterranean throughout most of the remainder of the 18th century. The Tuscan galley fleet was dismantled around 1718, Naples had only four old vessels by 1734 and the French Galley Corps had ceased to exist as an independent arm in 1748. Venice, the Papal States, and the Knights of Malta were the only state fleets that maintained galleys, though in nothing like their previous quantities. By 1790, there were fewer than 50 galleys in service among all the Mediterranean powers, half of which belonged to Venice.\n\nOared vessels remained in use in northern waters for a long time, though in subordinate role and in particular circumstances. In the Italian Wars, French galleys brought up from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic posed a serious threat to the early English Tudor navy during coastal operations. The response came in the building of a considerable fleet of oared vessels, including hybrids with a complete three-masted rig, as well as a Mediterranean-style galleys (that were even attempted to be manned with convicts and slaves). Under King Henry VIII, the English navy used several kinds of vessels that were adapted to local needs. English \"galliasses\" (very different from the Mediterranean vessel of the same name) were employed to cover the flanks of larger naval forces while \"pinnaces\" and \"rowbarges\" were used for scouting or even as a backup for the longboats and tenders for the larger sailing ships. During the Dutch Revolt (1566–1609) both the Dutch and Spanish found galleys useful for amphibious operations in the many shallow waters around the Low Countries where deep-draft sailing vessels could not enter.\n\nWhile galleys were too vulnerable to be used in large numbers in the open waters of the Atlantic, they were well-suited for use in much of the Baltic Sea by Denmark, Sweden, Russia, and some of the Central European powers with ports on the southern coast. There were two types of naval battlegrounds in the Baltic. One was the open sea, suitable for large sailing fleets; the other was the coastal areas and especially the chain of small islands and archipelagos that ran almost uninterrupted from Stockholm to the Gulf of Finland. In these areas, conditions were often too calm, cramped, and shallow for sailing ships, but they were excellent for galleys and other oared vessels. Galleys of the Mediterranean type were first introduced in the Baltic Sea around the mid-16th century as competition between the Scandinavian states of Denmark and Sweden intensified. The Swedish galley fleet was the largest outside the Mediterranean, and served as an auxiliary branch of the army. Very little is known about the design of Baltic Sea galleys, except that they were overall smaller than in the Mediterranean and they were rowed by army soldiers rather than convicts or slaves.\n\nGalleys were introduced to the Baltic Sea in the 16th century but the details of their designs are lacking due to the absence of records. They might have been built in a more regional style, but the only known depiction from the time shows a typical Mediterranean style vessel. There is conclusive evidence that Denmark became the first Baltic power to build classic Mediterranean-style galleys in the 1660s, though they proved to be generally too large to be useful in the shallow waters of the Baltic archipelagos. Sweden and especially Russia began to launch galleys and various rowed vessels in great numbers during the Great Northern War in the first two decades of the 18th century. Sweden was late in the game when it came to building an effective oared fighting fleet (\"skärgårdsflottan\", the archipelago fleet, officially \"arméns flotta\", the fleet of the army), while the Russian galley forces under Tsar Peter I developed into a supporting arm for the sailing navy and a well-functioning auxiliary of the army which infiltrated and conducted numerous raids on the eastern Swedish coast in the 1710s.\n\nSweden and Russia became the two main competitors for Baltic dominance in the 18th century, and built the largest galley fleets in the world at the time. They were used for amphibious operations in Russo-Swedish wars of 1741–43 and 1788–90. The last galleys ever constructed were built in 1796 by Russia, and remained in service well into the 19th century, but saw little action. The last time galleys were deployed in action was when the Russian navy was attacked in Åbo (Turku) in 1854 as part of the Crimean War. In the second half of the 18th century, the role of Baltic galleys in coastal fleets was replaced first with hybrid \"archipelago frigates\" (such as the turuma or pojama) and xebecs, and after the 1790s with various types of gunboats.\n\nBoth the Russian and Swedish navies were based on a form of conscription, and both navies used conscripts as galley rowers. This had several advantages over convicts or slaves: the rowers could be armed to fight as marines, they could be also used as land soldiers and invasion force, and were more skilled than forced labor. Since most naval conscripts came from coastal parishes and towns, most were already experienced seafarers when they entered the service.\n\nVarious types of indigenous galley-like vessels are used in Southeast Asia, namely: Lancaran, Borobudur ship, penjajap, kelulus, lanong, garay, kora-kora, ghurab, ghali, and karakoa. During the turn of the 16th century, Mediterranean influence came, mainly by Ottoman influences of sultanates in Nusantara archipelago. A royal galley (\"ghali kenaikan raja\") of the Malacca sultanate that was built approximately in 1453 is called \"Mendam Berahi\" (Malay for \"Suppressed Passion\"). It was 60 \"gaz\" (54.6 m) long and 6 \"depa\" (11 m) wide. This ghali had 3 masts and could carry 400 men; 200 of them were rowers in 50 rowing line. It was armed with 7 bow-mounted \"meriam\" (native cannon) and ramming beam.\n\nAcehnese in 1568 siege of Portuguese Malacca used 4 large galley 40–50 meter long each with 190 rowers in 24 banks. They were armed with 12 large camelos (3 at each bow side, 4 at stern), 1 basilisk (bow-mounted), 12 falcons, and 40 swivel guns. By then cannons, firearms, and other war material had come annually from Jeddah, and the Turks also sent military experts, masters of galleys, and technicians. The average Acehnese galley in the second half of the 16th century would have been approximately 50 metres long, have had two masts, with square sails and top sails, not lateen sails like those of Portuguese galleys. It would have been propelled by 24 oars on each side, carrying about 200 men aboard, and armed with 20 cannons (two or three large ones at the bow, the rest smaller swivel guns).\n\nIn 1575 siege, Aceh used 40 two-masted galleys with Turkish captains carrying 200–300 soldier of Turk, Arab, Deccanis, and Aceh origins. The state galleys (\"ghorab istana\") of Aceh, Daya, and Pedir is said to carry 10 \"meriam\", 50 \"lela\", and 120 \"cecorong\" (not counting the \"ispinggar\"). Smaller galley carry 5 \"meriam\", 20 \"lela\", and 50 \"cecorong\". Western and native sources mention that Aceh had 100–120 galleys at any time (not counting the smaller fusta and galiot), spread from Daya (west coast) to Pedir (east coast). One galley captured by Portuguese in 1629 during Iskandar Muda's reign is very large, and it was reported there were total 47 of them. She reached 100 m in length and 17 m in breadth, had 3 masts with square sails and topsails, propelled by 35 oars on each side and able to carry 700 men. It is armed with 98 guns: 18 large cannon (five 55-pounders at the bow, one 25-pounder at the stern, the rest were 17 and 18-pounders), 80 falcons, and many swivel guns. The ship is called \"\"Espanto do Mundo\"\" (terror of the universe), which probably a free translation from \"Cakradonya\" (Cakra Dunia). The Portuguese reported that it was bigger than anything ever built in the Christian world, and that its castle could compete with that of galleons.\n\nTwo Dutch engravings from 1598 and 1601 depicted galley from Banten and Madura. They had 2 and 1 mast(s), respectively. The major difference from mediterranean galleys, Nusantaran galley had raised fighting platform called \"\"balai\"\" in which the soldier stood, a feature common in warships of the region. The Sultanate of Gowa of the mid-17th century had \"galle'\" (or \"galé\") 40 m long and 6 m breadth, carrying 200–400 men. Other \"galle\"' of the kingdom varied between 23–35 m in length.\n\nGalleys have since their first appearance in ancient times been intended as highly maneuverable vessels, independent of winds by being rowed, and usually with a focus on speed under oars. The profile has therefore been that of a markedly elongated hull with a ratio of breadth to length at the waterline of at least 1:5, and in the case of ancient Mediterranean galleys as much as 1:10 with a small draught, the measurement of how much of a ship's structure that is submerged under water. To make it possible to efficiently row the vessels, the freeboard (the height of the railing above the surface of the water) was by necessity kept low. This gave oarsmen enough leverage to row efficiently, but at the expense of seaworthiness. These design characteristics made the galley fast and maneuverable, but more vulnerable to rough weather.\n\nThe documentary evidence for the construction of ancient galleys is fragmentary, particularly in pre-Roman times. Plans and schematics in the modern sense did not exist until the 17th century and nothing like them has survived from ancient times. How galleys were constructed has therefore been a matter of looking at circumstantial evidence in literature, art, coinage and monuments that include ships, some of them actually in natural size. Since the war galleys floated even with a ruptured hull and virtually never had any ballast or heavy cargo that could sink them, not a single wreck of one has so far been found. The only exception has been a partial wreck of a small Punic liburnian from the Roman era, the Marsala Ship.\n\nOn the funerary monument of the Egyptian king Sahure (2487–2475 BC) in Abusir, there are relief images of vessels with a marked sheer (the upward curvature at each end of the hull) and seven pairs of oars along its side, a number that was likely to have been merely symbolical, and steering oars in the stern. They have one mast, all lowered and vertical posts at stem and stern, with the front decorated with an Eye of Horus, the first example of such a decoration. It was later used by other Mediterranean cultures to decorate seagoing craft in the belief that it helped to guide the ship safely to its destination. These early galleys apparently lacked a keel meaning they lacked stiffness along their length. Therefore, they had large cables connecting stem and stern resting on massive crutches on deck. They were held in tension to avoid hogging, or bending the ship's construction upward in the middle, while at sea. In the 15th century BC, Egyptian galleys were still depicted with the distinctive extreme sheer, but had by then developed the distinctive forward-curving stern decorations with ornaments in the shape of lotus flowers. They had possibly developed a primitive type of keel, but still retained the large cables intended to prevent hogging.\nThe design of the earliest oared vessels is mostly unknown and highly conjectural. They likely used a mortise construction, but were sewn together rather than pinned together with nails and dowels. Being completely open, they were rowed (or even paddled) from the open deck, and likely had \"ram entries\", projections from the bow lowered the resistance of moving through water, making them slightly more hydrodynamic. The first true galleys, the triaconters (literally \"thirty-oarers\") and penteconters (\"fifty-oarers\") were developed from these early designs and set the standard for the larger designs that would come later. They were rowed on only one level, which made them fairly slow, likely only 5-5.5 knots. By the 8th century BC the first galleys rowed at two levels had been developed, among the earliest being the two-level penteconters which were considerably shorter than the one-level equivalents, and therefore more maneuverable. They were an estimated 25 m in length and displaced 15 tonnes with 25 pairs of oars. These could have reached an estimated top speed of up to 7.5 knots, making them the first genuine warships when fitted with bow rams. They were equipped with a single square sail on mast set roughly halfway along the length of the hull.\n\nBy the 5th century BC, the first \"triremes\" were in use by various powers in the eastern Mediterranean. It had now become a fully developed, highly specialized vessel of war that was capable of high speeds and complex maneuvers. At nearly 40 m in length, displacing almost 50 tonnes, it was more than three times as expensive as a two-level penteconter. A trireme also had an additional mast with a smaller square sail placed near the bow. Up to 170 oarsmen sat on three levels with one oar each that varied slightly in length. To accommodate three levels of oars, rowers sat staggered on three levels. Arrangements of the three levels are believed to have varied, but the most well-documented design made use of a projecting structure, or outrigger, where the oarlock in the form of a \"thole pin\" was placed. This allowed the outermost row of oarsmen enough leverage for full strokes that made efficient use of their oars.\nThe first dedicated war galleys fitted with rams were built with a mortise and tenon technique, a so-called \"shell-first\" method. In this, the planking of the hull was strong enough to hold the ship together structurally, and was also watertight without the need for caulking. Hulls had sharp bottoms without keelsons in order to support the structure and were reinforced by transverse framing secured with dowels with nails driven through them. To prevent the hull from hogging there was a \"hypozoma\" (υπόζωμα = underbelt), a thick, doubled rope that connected bow with stern. It was kept taut to add strength to the construction along its length, but its exact design or the method of tightening is not known. The ram, the primary weapon of ancient galleys from around the 8th to the 4th century, was not attached directly on the hull but to a structure extending from it. This way the ram could twist off if got stuck after ramming rather than breaking the integrity of the hull. The ram fitting consisted of a massive, projecting timber and the ram itself was a thick bronze casting with horizontal blades that could weigh from 400 kg up to 2 tonnes.\n\nGalleys from 4th century BC up to the time of the early Roman Empire in the 1st century AD became successively larger. Three levels of oars was the practical upper limit, but it was improved on by making ships longer, broader, and heavier and placing more than one rower per oar. Naval conflict grew more intense and extensive, and by 100 BC galleys with four, five or six rows of oarsmen were commonplace and carried large complements of soldiers and catapults. With high freeboard (up to 3 m) and additional tower structures from which missiles could be shot down onto enemy decks, they were intended to be like floating fortresses. Designs with everything from eight rows of oarsmen and upward were built, but most of them are believed to have been impractical show pieces never used in actual warfare. Ptolemy IV, the Greek pharaoh of Egypt 221–205 BC, is recorded as building a gigantic ship with \"forty\" rows of oarsmen, though no specification of its design remains. One suggested design was that of a huge trireme catamaran with up to 14 men per oar and it is assumed that it was intended as a showpiece rather than a practical warship.\n\nWith the consolidation of Roman imperial power, the size of both fleets and galleys decreased considerably. The huge polyremes disappeared and the fleet were equipped primarily with triremes and liburnians, compact biremes with 25 pairs of oars that were well suited for patrol duty and chasing down raiders and pirates. In the northern provinces oared patrol boats were employed to keep local tribes in check along the shores of rivers like the Rhine and the Danube. As the need for large warships disappeared, the design of the trireme, the pinnacle of ancient war ship design, fell into obscurity and was eventually forgotten. The last known reference to triremes in battle is dated to 324 at the Battle of the Hellespont. In the late 5th century the Byzantine historian Zosimus declared the knowledge of how to build them to have been long since forgotten.\n\nThe earliest medieval galley specification comes from an order of Charles I of Sicily, in 1275 AD. Overall length 39.30 m, keel length 28.03 m, depth 2.08 m. Hull width 3.67 m. Width between outriggers 4.45 m. 108 oars, most 6.81 m long, some 7.86 m, 2 steering oars 6.03 m long. Foremast and middle mast respectively heights 16.08 m, 11.00 m; circumference both 0.79 m, yard lengths 26.72 m, 17.29 m. Overall deadweight tonnage approximately 80 metric tons. This type of vessel had two, later three, men on a bench, each working his own oar. This vessel had much longer oars than the Athenian trireme which were 4.41 m & 4.66 m long. This type of warship was called \"galia sottil\".\n\nThe primary warship of the Byzantine navy until the 12th century was the dromon and other similar ship types. Considered an evolution of the Roman liburnian, the term first appeared in the late 5th century, and was commonly used for a specific kind of war-galley by the 6th century. The term \"dromōn\" (literally \"runner\") itself comes from the Greek root \"drom-(áō)\", \"to run\", and 6th-century authors like Procopius are explicit in their references to the speed of these vessels. During the next few centuries, as the naval struggle with the Arabs intensified, heavier versions with two or possibly even three banks of oars evolved.\n\nThe accepted view is that the main developments which differentiated the early dromons from the liburnians, and that henceforth characterized Mediterranean galleys, were the adoption of a full deck, the abandonment of rams on the bow in favor of an above-water spur, and the gradual introduction of lateen sails. The exact reasons for the abandonment of the ram are unclear. Depictions of upward-pointing beaks in the 4th-century \"Vatican Vergil\" manuscript may well illustrate that the ram had already been replaced by a spur in late Roman galleys. One possibility is that the change occurred because of the gradual evolution of the ancient shell-first construction method, against which rams had been designed, into the skeleton-first method, which produced a stronger and more flexible hull, less susceptible to ram attacks. At least by the early 7th century, the ram's original function had been forgotten.\n\nThe dromons that Procopius described were single-banked ships of probably 25 oars per side. Unlike ancient vessels, which used an outrigger, these extended directly from the hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. The stern (\"prymnē\") had a tent that covered the captain's berth; the prow featured an elevated forecastle that acted as a fighting platform and could house one or more siphons for the discharge of Greek fire; and on the largest dromons, there were wooden castles on either side between the masts, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.\n\nFrom the 12th century, the design of war galleys evolved into the form that would remain largely the same until the building of the last war galleys in the late 18th century. The length to breadth-ratio was a minimum of 8:1. A rectangular \"telaro\", an outrigger, was added to support the oars and the rowers' benches were laid out in a diagonal herringbone pattern angled aft on either side of a central gangway, or \"corsia\". It was based on the form of the \"galea\", the smaller Byzantine galleys, and would be known mostly by the Italian term \"gallia sottila\" (literally \"slender galley\"). A second, smaller mast was added sometime in the 13th century and the number of rowers was rose from two to three rowers per bench as a standard from the late 13th to the early 14th century. The \"gallee sottili\" would make up the bulk the main war fleets of every major naval power in the Mediterranean, assisted by the smaller single-masted \"galiotte\", as well as the Christian and Muslim corsairs fleets. Ottoman galleys were very similar in design, though in general smaller, faster under sail, but slower under oars. The standard size of the galley remained stable from the 14th until the early 16th century, when the introduction of naval artillery began to have effects on design and tactics.\n\nThe traditional two side rudders were complemented with a stern rudder sometime after c. 1400 and eventually the side rudders disappeared altogether. It was also during the 15th century that large artillery pieces were first mounted on galleys. Burgundian records from the mid-15th century describe galleys with some form of guns, but do not specify the size. The first conclusive evidence of a large cannon mounted on a galley comes from a woodcut of a Venetian galley in 1486. The first guns were fixed directly on timbers in the bow and aimed directly forward, a placement that would remain largely unchanged until the galley disappeared from active service in the 19th century.\nWith the introduction of guns in the bows of galleys, a permanent wooden structure called \"rambade\" (French: \"rambade\"; Italian: \"rambata\"; Spanish: \"arrumbada\") was introduced. The \"rambade\" became standard on virtually all galleys in the early 16th century. There were some variations in the navies of different Mediterranean powers, but the overall layout was the same. The forward-aiming battery was covered by a wooden platform which gave gunners a minimum of protection, and functioned as both a staging area for boarding attacks and as a firing platform for on-board soldiers. After its introduction, the rambade became a standard detail on every fighting galley until the very end of galley era in the early 19th century.\n\nIn the mid-17th century, galleys reached what has been described as their \"final form\". Galleys had looked more or less the same for over four centuries and a fairly standardized classification system for different sizes of galleys had been developed by the Mediterranean bureaucracies, based mostly on the number of benches in a vessel. A Mediterranean galley would have 25–26 pairs of oars with five men per oar (c. 250 rowers), 50–100 sailors and 50–100 soldiers for a total of about 500 men. The exceptions were the significantly larger \"flagships\" (often called \"lanternas\", \"lantern galleys\") that had 30 pairs of oars and up to seven rowers per oar. The armament consisted of one heavy 24- or 36-pounder gun in the bows flanked by two to four 4- to 12-pounders. Rows of light swivel guns were often placed along the entire length of the galley on the railings for close-quarter defense. The length-to-width ratio of the ships was about 8:1, with two main masts carrying one large lateen sail each. In the Baltic, galleys were generally shorter with a length-to-width ratio from 5:1 to 7:1, an adaptation to the cramped conditions of the Baltic archipelagos.\n\nA single mainmast was standard on most war galleys until c. 1600. A second, shorter mast could be raised temporarily in the bows, but became permanent by the early 17th century. It was stepped slightly to the side to allow for the recoil of the heavy guns; the other was placed roughly in the center of the ship. A third smaller mast further astern, akin to a mizzen mast, was also introduced on large galleys, possibly in the early 17th century, but was standard at least by the early 18th century. Galleys had little room for provisions and depended on frequent resupplying and were often beached at night to rest the crew and cook meals. Where cooking areas were actually present, they consisted of a clay-lined box with a hearth or similar cooking equipment fitted on the vessel in place of a rowing bench, usually on the port (left) side.\nThroughout their long history, galleys relied on rowing as the most important means of propulsion. The arrangement of rowers during the 1st millennium BC developed gradually from a single row up to three rows arranged in a complex, staggered seating arrangement. Anything above three levels, however, proved to be physically impracticable. Initially, there was only one rower per oar, but the number steadily increased, with a number of different combinations of rowers per oar and rows of oars. The ancient terms for galleys was based on the numbers of rows or rowers plying the oars, not the number of rows of oars. Today it is best known by a modernized Latin terminology based on numerals with the ending \"-reme\" from \"rēmus\", \"oar\". A \"trireme\" was a ship with three rows of oarsmen, a \"quadrireme\" four, a \"hexareme\" six, and so forth. There were warships that ran up to ten or even eleven rows, but anything above six was rare. A huge \"forty\"-rowed ship was built during the reign of Ptolemy IV in Egypt. Little is known about its design, but it is assumed to have been an impractical prestige vessel.\n\nAncient rowing was done in a fixed seated position, the most effective rowing position, with rowers facing the stern. A sliding stroke, which provided the strength from both legs as well as the arms, was suggested by earlier historians, but no conclusive evidence has supported it. Practical experiments with the full-scale reconstruction \"Olympias\" has shown that there was insufficient space, while moving or rolling seats would have been highly impractical to construct with ancient methods. Rowers in ancient war galleys sat below the upper deck with little view of their surroundings. The rowing was therefore managed by supervisors, and coordinated with pipes or rhythmic chanting. Galleys were highly maneuverable, able to turn on their axis or even to row backward, though it required a skilled and experienced crew. In galleys with an arrangement of three men per oar, all would be seated, but the rower furthest inboard would perform a stand-and-sit stroke, getting up on his feet to push the oar forward, and then sitting down again to pull it back.\n\nThe faster a vessel travels, the more energy it uses. Reaching high speed requires energy which a human-powered vessel is incapable of producing. Oar systems generate very low amounts of energy for propulsion (only about 70 W per rower) and the upper limit for rowing in a fixed position is around 10 knots. Ancient war galleys of the kind used in Classical Greece are by modern historians considered to be the most energy-efficient and fastest of galley designs throughout history. A full-scale replica of a 5th-century BC trireme, the \"Olympias\" was built 1985–87 and was put through a series of trials to test its performance. It proved that a cruising speed of 7–8 knots could be maintained for an entire day. Sprinting speeds of up to 10 knots were possible, but only for a few minutes and would tire the crew quickly. Ancient galleys were built very light and the original triremes are assumed to never have been surpassed in speed. Medieval galleys are believed to have been considerably slower, especially since they were not built with ramming tactics in mind. A cruising speed of no more than 2–3 knots has been estimated. A sprint speed of up to 7 knots was possible for 20–30 minutes, but risked exhausting the rowers completely.\n\nRowing in headwinds or even moderately rough weather was difficult as well as exhausting. In high seas, ancient galleys would set sail to run before the wind. They were highly susceptible to high waves, and could become unmanageable if the rowing frame (\"apostis\") came awash. Ancient and medieval galleys are assumed to have sailed only with the wind more or less astern with a top speed of 8–9 knots in fair conditions.\n\nContrary to the popular image of rowers chained to the oars, conveyed by movies such as \"Ben Hur\", there is no evidence that ancient navies ever made use of condemned criminals or slaves as oarsmen, with the possible exception of Ptolemaic Egypt. Literary evidence indicates that Greek and Roman navies relied on paid labor or ordinary soldiers to man their galleys. Slaves were put at the oars only in times of extreme crisis. In some cases, these people were given freedom thereafter, while in others they began their service aboard as free men. Roman merchant vessels (usually sailing vessels) were manned by slaves, sometimes even with slaves as ship's master, but this was seldom the case in merchant galleys.\n\nIt was only in the early 16th century that the modern idea of the galley slave became commonplace. Galley fleets as well as the size of individual vessels increase in size, which required more rowers. The number of benches could not be increased without lengthening hulls beyond their structural limits, and more than three oars per bench was not practicable. The demand for more rowers also meant that the relatively limited number of skilled oarsmen could not keep up with the demand of large galley fleets. It became increasingly common to man galleys with convicts or slaves, which required a simpler method of rowing. The older method of employing professional rowers using the \"alla sensile\" method (one oar per man, with two to three sharing the same bench) was gradually phased out in favor of rowing \"a scaloccio\", which required less skill. A single large oar was used for each bench, with several rowers working it together and the number of oarsmen per oar rose from three up to five. In some very large command galleys, there could be as many as seven to an oar.\n\nAll major Mediterranean powers sentenced criminals to galley service, but initially only in time of war. Christian naval powers such as Spain frequently employed Muslim captives and prisoners of war. The Ottoman navy and its North African corsair allies often put Christian prisoners to the oars, but also mixed volunteers. Spain relied on mostly servile rowers, in great part because its organizational structure was geared toward employing slaves and convicts. Venice was one of few major naval powers that used almost only free rowers, a result of their reliance on \"alla sensile\" rowing which required skilled professional rowers. The Knights of Saint John used slaves extensively, as did the Papal States, Florence, and Genoa. North African \"ghazi\" corsairs relied almost entirely on Christian slaves for rowers.\n\nIn ancient galleys under sail, most of the moving power came from a single square sail. It was rigged on a mast somewhat forward of the center of the ship with a smaller mast carrying a head sail in the bow. Triangular lateen sails are attested as early as the 2nd century AD, and gradually became the sail of choice for galleys. By the 9th century, lateens were firmly established as part of the standard galley rig. The lateen rig was more complicated and required a larger crew to handle than a square sail rig, but this was not a problem in the heavily manned galleys. Belisarius' Byzantine invasion fleet of 533 was at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that by the time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation in the Mediterranean. Unlike a square sail rig, the spar of a lateen sail did not pivot around the mast. To change tacks, the entire spar had to be lifted over the mast and to the other side. Since the spar was often much longer than the mast itself, and not much shorter than the ship itself, it was a complex and time-consuming maneuver.\n\nIn the earliest times of naval warfare boarding was the only means of deciding a naval engagement, but little to nothing is known about the tactics involved. In the first recorded naval battle in history, the Battle of the Delta, the forces of Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses III won a decisive victory over a force made up of the enigmatic group known as the Sea Peoples. As shown in commemorative reliefs of the battle, Egyptian archers on ships and the nearby shores of the Nile rain down arrows on the enemy ships. At the same time Egyptian galleys engage in boarding action and capsize the ships of the Sea Peoples with ropes attached to grappling hooks thrown into the rigging.\n\nAround the 8th century BC, ramming began to be employed as war galleys were equipped with heavy bronze rams. Records of the Persian Wars in the early 5th century BC by the Ancient historian Herodotus (c. 484–25 BC) show that by this time ramming tactics had evolved among the Greeks. The formations adapted for ramming warfare could either be in columns in line ahead, one ship following the next, or in a line abreast, with the ships side by side, depending on the tactical situation and the surrounding geography. The primary methods for attack was either to break through the enemy formation or to outflank it. Ramming itself was done by smashing into the rear or side of an enemy ship, punching a hole in the planking. This did not actually sink an ancient galley unless it was heavily laden with cargo and stores. With a normal load, it was buoyant enough to float even with a breached hull. Breaking the enemy's oars was another way of rendering ships immobile, rendering them easier targets. If ramming was not possible or successful, the on-board complement of soldiers would attempt to board and capture the enemy vessel by securing it with grappling irons, accompanied by missile fire with arrows or javelins. Trying to set the enemy ship on fire by hurling incendiary missiles or by pouring the content of fire pots attached to long handles is thought to have been used, especially since smoke below decks would easily disable rowers. Rhodes was the first naval power to employ this weapon, sometime in the 3rd century, and used it to fight off head-on attacks or to frighten enemies into exposing their sides for a ramming attack.\n\nA successful ramming was difficult to achieve; just the right amount of speed and precise maneuvering were required. Fleets that did not have well-drilled, experienced oarsmen and skilled commanders relied more on boarding with superior infantry (such as increasing the complement to 40 soldiers). Ramming attempts were countered by keeping the bow toward the enemy until the enemy crew tired, and then attempting to board as quickly as possible. A double-line formation could be used to achieve a breakthrough by engaging the first line and then rushing the rearguard in to take advantage of weak spots in the enemy's defense. This required superiority in numbers, though, since a shorter front risked being flanked or surrounded.\n\nDespite the attempts to counter increasingly heavy ships, ramming tactics were gradually superseded in the last centuries BC by the Macedonians and Romans, both primarily land-based powers. Hand-to-hand fighting with large complements of heavy infantry supported by ship-borne catapults dominated the fighting style during the Roman era, a move that was accompanied by the conversion to heavier ships with larger rowing complements and more men per oar. Though effectively lowering mobility, it meant that less skill was required from individual oarsmen. Fleets thereby became less dependent on rowers with a lifetime of experience at the oar.\n\nBy late antiquity, in the 1st centuries AD, ramming tactics had completely disappeared along with the knowledge of the design of the ancient trireme. Medieval galleys instead developed a projection, or \"spur\", in the bow that was designed to break oars and to act as a boarding platform for storming enemy ships. The only remaining examples of ramming tactics were passing references to attempts to collide with ships in order to destabilize or capsize them.\n\nThe Byzantine navy, the largest Mediterranean war fleet throughout most of the Early Middle Ages, employed crescent formations with the flagship in the center and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks. Similar tactics are believed to have been employed by the Arab fleets they frequently fought from the 7th century onward. The Byzantines were the first to employ Greek fire, a highly effective incendiary liquid, as a naval weapon. It could be fired through a metal tube, or \"siphon\", mounted in the bows, similar to a modern flame thrower. Greek fire was similar to napalm and was a key to several major Byzantine victories. By 835, the weapon had spread to the Arabs, who equipped \"harraqas\", \"fireships\", with it. The initial stages in naval battles was an exchanges of missiles, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows, caltrops, and javelins. The aim was not to sink ships, but to deplete the ranks of the enemy crews before the boarding commenced, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Byzantine dromons had pavesades, racks along the railings, on which marines could hang their shields, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles on either side between the masts, which allowed archers to shoot from an elevated firing position.\nLater medieval navies continued to use similar tactics, with the line abreast formation as standard. As galleys were intended to be fought from the bows, and were at their weakest along the sides, especially in the middle. The crescent formation employed by the Byzantines continued to be used throughout the Middle Ages. It would allow the wings of the fleet to crash their bows straight into the sides of the enemy ships at the edge of the formation.\n\nRoger of Lauria (c. 1245–1305) was a successful medieval naval tactician who fought for the Aragon navy against French Angevin fleets in the War of the Sicilian Vespers. At the Battle of Malta in July 1283, he lured out Angevin galleys that were beached stern-first by openly challenging them. Attacking them in a strong defensive position head-on would have been very dangerous since it offered good cohesion, allowed rowers to escape ashore and made it possible to reinforce weak positions by transferring infantry along the shore. He also employed skilled crossbowmen and almogavars, light infantry, that were more nimbler in ship-to-ship actions than heavily armed and armored French soldiers. At the Battle of the Gulf of Naples in 1284, his forces launched clay cooking pots filled with soap before attacking; when the pots broke against the enemy decks, they became perilously slippery and difficult for heavy infantry to keep their feet on.\n\nThe earliest guns were of large calibers, and were initially of wrought iron, which made them weak compared to cast bronze guns that would become standard in the 16th century. They were at first fixed directly on timbers in the bow, aiming directly forward. This placement would remain largely unchanged until the galley disappeared from active service in the 19th century. The introduction of heavy guns and small arms did not change tactics considerably. If anything, it accentuated the bow as the offensive weapon, being both a staging area for boarders and the given position for small arms and cannons. The galley was capable of outperforming sailing vessel in early battles. It retained a distinct tactical advantage even after the initial introduction of naval artillery because of the ease with which it could be brought to bear upon an opposing vessel.\nIn large-scale galley-to-galley engagements, tactics remained essentially the same until the end of the 16th century. Cannons and small firearms were introduced around the 14th century, but did not have immediate effects on tactics; the same basic crescent formation in line abreast that was employed at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 was used by the Byzantine fleet almost a millennium earlier. Artillery on early gun galleys was not used as a long-range standoff weapon against other gun-armed ships. The maximum distance at which contemporary cannons were effective, c. 500 m (1600 ft), could be covered by a galley in about two minutes, much faster than the reload time of any heavy artillery. Gun crews would therefore hold their fire until the last possible moment, somewhat similar to infantry tactics in the pre-industrial era of short range firearms. The weak points of a galley remained the sides and especially the rear, the command center. Unless one side managed to outmaneuver the other, battle would be met with ships crashing into each other head on. Once fighting began with ships locking on to one another bow to bow, the fighting would be fought over the front line ships. Unless a galley was completely overrun by an enemy boarding party, fresh troops could be fed into the fight from reserve vessels in the rear.\n\nGalleys were used for purely ceremonial purposes by many rulers and states. In early modern Europe, galleys enjoyed a level of prestige that sailing vessels did not enjoy. Galleys had from an early stage been commanded by the leaders of land forces, and fought with tactics adapted from land warfare. As such, they enjoyed the prestige associated with land battles, the ultimate achievement of a high-standing noble or king. In the Baltic, the Swedish king Gustav I, the founder of the modern Swedish state, showed particular interest in galleys, as was befitting a Renaissance prince. Whenever traveling by sea, Gustav, the court, royal bureaucrats, and the royal bodyguard would travel by galley. Around the same time, English king Henry VIII had high ambitions to live up to the reputation of the omnipotent Renaissance ruler and also had a few Mediterranean-style galleys built (and even manned them with slaves), though the English navy relied mostly on sailing ships at the time.\n\nDespite the rising importance of sailing warships, galleys were more closely associated with land warfare, and the prestige associated with it. British naval historian Nicholas Rodger has described this as display of \"the supreme symbol of royal power ... derived from its intimate association with armies, and consequently with princes\". This was put to perhaps its greatest effect by the French \"Sun King\", Louis XIV, in the form of a dedicated galley corps. Louis and the French state created a tool and symbol of royal authority that did little fighting, but was a potent extension of absolutist ambitions. Galleys were built to scale for the royal flotilla at the Grand Canal at the Gardens of Versailles for the amusement of the court. The royal galleys patrolled the Mediterranean, forcing ships of other states to salute the King's banner, convoyed ambassadors and cardinals, and obediently participating in naval parades and royal pageantry. Historian Paul Bamford described the galleys as vessels that \"must have appealed to military men and to aristocratic officers ... accustomed to being obeyed and served\".\nSentencing criminals, political dissenters and religious deviants as galley rowers also turned the galley corps into a large, feared, and cost-effective prison system. French Protestants were particularly ill-treated at the oar and though they were only a small minority, their experiences came to dominate the legacy of the king's galleys. In 1909, French author Albert Savine (1859–1927) wrote that \"[a]fter the Bastille, the galleys were the greatest horror of the old regime\". Long after convicts stopped serving in the galleys, and even after the reign of Napoleon, the term \"galérien\" (\"galley rower\") remained a symbolic general term for forced labor and convicts serving harsh sentences.\n\nBeing a galley rower did not carry such stigma at Baltic, where galley rowers were conscripts: rather they considered themselves as marine soldiers. The main building of the Finnish Naval Academy at Suomenlinna, Helsinki bears the nickname \"Kivikaleeri\" (\"Stone Galley\") as a legacy of the era.\n\nThe Istanbul Naval Museum contains the galley \"Tarihi Kadırga\" (Turkish for \"historical galley\", ultimately from Byzantine Greek \"katergon\"). The galley was used in the period of the sultan Mehmed IV (1648–1687), but researches indicate that it (or some parts?) may have been built at the end of the 16th century. She was the personal galley of the sultan, and remained in service until 1839. She is presumably the only surviving galley in the world, albeit without its masts. It is 37 m long, 5.7 m wide, has a draught of about 2 m, weighs about 140 tons, and has 48 oars powered by 144 oarsmen.\n\nA 1971 reconstruction of the \"Real\", the flagship of John of Austria in the Battle of Lepanto (1571), is in the Museu Marítim in Barcelona. The ship was 60 m long and 6.2 m wide, had a draught of 2.1 m, weighing 239 tons empty, was propelled by 290 rowers, and carried about 400 crew and fighting soldiers at Lepanto. She was substantially larger than the typical galleys of her time.\n\nA group called \"The Trireme Trust\" operates, in conjunction with the Greek Navy, a reconstruction of an ancient Greek Trireme, the \"Olympias\".\n\n\"Ivlia\" is a replica Greek bireme built at Sochi on the Black Sea in 1989 which spent six seasons touring round Europe with volunteer crews.\n\nThe \"Nomos,\" another trireme originally built for Clash of the Titans, is preserved at the Charlestown Shipwreck & Heritage Centre in Charlestown, Cornwall.\n\nIn 1965, the remains of a small Venetian galley (fusta) sunk in 1509 were found in Lake Garda, Italy. The vessel had been burned and only the lower hull remained.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, a sunken medieval galley was found close to the island of San Marco in Boccalama, in the Venice Lagoon. The hull has been dated, from the context and the C-14 analysis, between the late 13th and early 14th century.\n\nThe excavation and the photogrammetric survey (photogrammetry) and 3D laser scanner of this important testimony of medieval nautical archaeology has started in 2001 through two complex executive phases. The stratigraphic excavation of the wreck was in fact performed entirely underwater, according to the archaeological methodologies. The survey of the hull was instead realized after the setting in dry the entire medieval perimeter of the submerged island. This operation took place through the infixation of a continuous barrier consisting of sheet piles and the use of water pumps. This long excavation and documentation campaign was directed by underwater archaeologist Marco D'Agostino and, as deputy director, by his colleague Stefano Medas.\n\nThe lower hull is mostly intact. It was not recovered due to high costs.\n\n\n\n"}

The surrounding Clearwater County's administration office is located in Rocky Mountain House.\n\nThe town has a long history dating to the 18th century with the presence of British and Canadian fur traders during the westward Canadian expansion. In 1799, the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company each established the Rocky Mountain House and Acton House fur trading posts. Trade with the local aboriginal peoples continued until 1821 when the companies merged, they continued to trade until 1875 and closed the Rocky Mountain House post. The name of the settlement however remained.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain House settlement also served as a launching point for many explorers such as David Thompson, in search for a passage west to the Pacific Ocean. Many travellers used this location as a stop on their way further west or northwest, just as they do into the 21st century.\n\nThe next wave of adventurers entered the region at the beginning of the 20th century in search of opportunities presented by lush farmland and the abundance of natural resources. Rocky Mountain House became a firmly established town by 1912. Settlers of Scandinavian origin made up a significant part of early 20th century settlement in the region.\n\nRocky Mountain House and Acton House were a pair of fur trade posts from 1799 to 1876. Rocky Mountain House belonged to the North West Company (NWC) and Acton House to the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). When the two companies merged in 1821, the name Rocky Mountain House was retained. The posts were opened and closed seven times.\n\nRocky Mountain House was the westernmost post on the North Saskatchewan and was within sight of the Rocky Mountains. The fort facilitated trade with the Blackfeet and Piegans as well as the Kootenays across the mountains. The Kootenays were prevented from reaching Fort Edmonton by the Blackfeet and Piegans who wanted to profit as middlemen and keep them from getting guns. The fort also served as a base for finding a pass across the Rocky Mountains. The post also produced pemmican and York boats.\n\nThe posts were built at the confluence of the Clearwater River and the North Saskatchewan River. They were on the north bank just above the Clearwater and strongly built for protection from the Blackfeet. During low water there were rapids near the post. Around 1980, only two stone chimneys were standing. An interpretive centre was subsequently developed at this location.\n\n\nThe North Saskatchewan River borders Rocky Mountain House to the west where the Clearwater River flows into the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nCrimson Lake is a lake approximately northwest of town. Crimson Lake is home to Crimson Lake Provincial Park.\n\nRocky Mountain House has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc) that borders on a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb). Daytime temperatures are in general representative for the latter, but the larger diurnal temperature variation with the high elevation ensures frequent frosts. The January average high of around is actually much milder than clear continental areas further east in Canada on similar and lower parallels.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Rocky Mountain House was on 23 July 1928. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 12 February 1936.\n\nIn the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Rocky Mountain House recorded a population of 6,635 living in 2,599 of its 2,954 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 6,933. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.\n\nThe Town of Rocky Mountain House's 2012 municipal census counted a population of 7,300, a 1.0% increase over its 2007 municipal census population of 7,231.\n\nIn the 2011 Census, the Town of Rocky Mountain House had a population of 6,933 living in 2,651 of its 2800 total dwellings, a 0.9% change from its 2006 population of 6,874. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.\n\nThe economy of the Rocky Mountain House area is driven by petroleum, agriculture, and forestry. Tourism also plays a role in its economy due to its location at the crossroads of Highway 22 and Highway 11, and its location midway between Red Deer and the scenic Alberta's Rockies region.\n\nOn the road, Rocky Mountain House is served by Highway 22 and Highway 11.\n\nIn the air, Rocky Mountain House is served by its airport.\n\nThe Recreation, Parks & Community Services Department hosts five annual sports tournaments.

It is a growing suburb with many Queenslander style houses and leafy streets. The area is quite hilly and most of the suburb is on a north-facing slope.\n\nMitchelton is an area with a long history. Mitchelton's name comes from one particular family of the first settlers in the area. The Mitchell family emigrated from England in the 1850s. Nicholas Mitchell purchased an estate he named \"Mitchelton\" by 1875. This area was first subdivided in the 1890s.\n\nSt Matthews Church of England was built from 1867 to 1869. The church and its cemetery are at 35 Church Road (). It was designed by Charles Tiffin.\n\nOn 4 October 1913, Arthur Blackwood sold a large portion of land known as the Oxford Park Estate between Samford Road and Kedron Brook. It was a subdivision of 300 suburban allotments (mostly 32 perches) and 8 larger farm allotments on St Helens Road fronting Kedron Brook. The estate created Blackwood Street and University Road (the northern part of which is now Pascoe Road). One of the advertised benefits of the estate were its proximity to the proposed Groveley railway station on the Ferny Grove railway line. The estate gave its name to the Oxford Park railway station, despite the railway station being to the west of the estate, which resulted in land near that railway station being commonly known as Oxford Park (although that land never formed part of the Oxford Park subdivision).\n\nGrovely State School opened on 9 October 1916. It was renamed Mitchelton State School in 1923. (It is not to be confused with the present day Grovely State School in Keperra, which opened in 1956).\n\nIn June 1922, Grovely Lodge Estate, 3rd section, made up of 149 residential sites and 4 large blocks, were advertised by Cameron Bros Auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states that the estate is 5 minutes walk to both Mitchelton railway station and state school.\n\nThe first section of Mitchelton View Estate was offered for sale in 1926 by B.F. Caniffe. In May 1933, B.F. Caniffe auctioned 50 suburban blocks, the third section of the Mitchelton View Estate. The subdivision was bounded by Gizerah Street, Taylors Road, Frasers Road and Mashobra Street. However, the bidding did not reach the reserve price and the blocks were not sold.\n\nIn 1930 the Sisters of the Good Shepherd established the Good Shepherd Home for girls with special needs or those deemed to be \"uncontrollable\" in their own homes; these girls worked in the home's commercial laundry.

The rights concerning intersex people are more vague.\n\nThis keeps pace with the latest global figures on acceptance of homosexuality, which suggest that acceptance of LGBTQ communities is becoming more widespread only in secular, affluent countries.\n\nHowever, an accepting policy toward gay and lesbian soldiers does not invariably guarantee that LGBTQ citizens are immune to discrimination in that particular society. Even in countries where LGBTQ persons are free to serve in the military, activists lament that there remains room for improvement. Israel, for example, a country that otherwise struggles to implement LGBTQ-positive social policy, nevertheless has a military well known for its broad acceptance of openly gay soldiers.\n\nHistory has seen societies that both embrace and shun openly gay service-members in the military. But more recently, the high-profile 2010 hearings on \"Don't ask, don't tell\" in the United States propelled the issue to the center of international attention. They also shed light both on the routine discrimination, violence, and hardship faced by LGBTQ-identified soldiers, as well as arguments for and against a ban on their service.\n\nThe \"LGBT Military Index\" is an index created by the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies that uses 19 indicative policies and best practices to rank over 100 countries on the inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender service members in the armed forces. Countries with higher rankings, especially the ones at the top, stand out for their multiple concerted efforts to promote the inclusion of gay and lesbian soldiers. In many of them special support and advocacy organizations are present. By contrast, countries near the bottom of the index show the lack of aspiration to promote greater inclusion of the LGBT military personnel.\n\nThroughout history, there have been several cultures that have looked favorably on homosexual behavior in the military. Perhaps the most well-known example is found in ancient Greece and Rome. Homosexual behavior was encouraged among soldiers because it was thought to increase unit cohesiveness, morale and bravery. The Sacred Band of Thebes was a military unit from 378 BCE which consisted of male lovers who were known for their effectiveness in battle. Same-sex love was also prevalent among the Samurai class in Japan and was practiced between an adult and a younger apprentice.\n\nHowever, homosexual behavior has been considered a criminal offense according to civilian and military law in most countries throughout history. There are various accounts of trials and executions of members of the Knights Templar in the 14th century and British sailors during the Napoleonic wars for homosexuality. Official bans on gays serving in the military first surfaced in the early 20th century. The U.S. introduced a ban in a revision of the Articles of War of 1916 and the UK first prohibited homosexuality in the Army and Air Force Acts in 1955. However some nations, of which Sweden is the most well-known case, never introduced bans on homosexuality in the military, but issued recommendations on exempting homosexuals from military service.\n\nTo regulate homosexuality in the U.S. military, physical exams and interviews were used to spot men with effeminate characteristics during recruitment. Many soldiers accused of homosexual behavior were discharged for being \"sexual psychopaths\", although the number of discharges greatly decreased during wartime efforts.\n\nThe rationale for excluding gays and lesbians from serving in the military is often rooted in cultural norms and values and has changed over time. Originally, it was believed that gays were not physically able to serve effectively. The pervading argument during the 20th century focused more on military effectiveness. And finally, more recent justifications include the potential for conflict between heterosexual and homosexual service members and possible \"heterosexual resentment and hostility.\"\n\nMany countries have since revised these policies and allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military (e.g. Israel in 1993 and the UK in 2000). There are currently more than 30 countries, including nearly all of the NATO members which allow gays and lesbians to serve and around 10 more countries that don't outwardly prohibit them from serving.\n\nThe U.S. is one of the last more developed nations to overturn its ban on allowing gays, lesbians and bisexuals to openly serve in the military when it repealed the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy in 2010.\n\nLike sexual orientation, policies regulating the service of transgender military personnel vary greatly by country. Based on data collected by the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies seventeen countries currently allow transgender people to serve in their military. They are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile the US military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was rescinded in 2011 allowing open service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members, transgender people are still barred from entering the US military. This ban is effective via enlistment health screening regulations: \"Current or history of psychosexual conditions (302), including but not limited to transsexualism, exhibitionism, transvestism, voyeurism, and other paraphilias.\" Unlike Don't Ask, Don't Tell, this policy is not a law mandated by Congress, but an internal military policy. Despite this, studies suggest that the propensity of trans individuals to serve in the US military is as much as twice that as cisgender individuals. In the Harvard Kennedy School's 2013 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 20% of transgender respondents reported having served in the armed forces, compared with 10% of cisgender respondents.\n\nAmerican transgender veterans face institutional hardships, including the provision of medical care while in the armed services and after discharge stemming from their gender identity or expression. Transgender veterans may also face additional challenges, such as facing a higher rate of homelessness and home foreclosure, higher rates of losing jobs often directly stemming from their trans identity, and high rates of not being hired for specific jobs because of their gender identity.\n\nThe armed forces of Israel, the United States and Australia have employed intersex individuals depending on the nature of their conditions, but the guidelines are vague and seldom talked about.\n\nIn the US army, six states (Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and West Virginia) initially refused to comply with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's order that gay spouses of National Guard members be given the same federal marriage benefits as heterosexual spouses, forcing couples to travel hours round trip to the nearest federal installation. Furthermore, some benefits offered on bases, like support services for relatives of deployed service members, could still be blocked. This changed with a ruling by US Attorney General Loretta Lynch in the Supreme Court on 26 June 2015 which ruled that Federal marriage benefits would be made available to gay couples in all 50 US states.\n\nIn 2013 legal changes were said to revert to practices to those before Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the National Defense Authorization Act contains language some claimed permitted individuals to continue discriminating against LGB soldiers.\n\nFrom June 30, 2016 to April 11, 2019, transgender personnel in the United States military were allowed to serve in their preferred gender upon completing transition. From January 1, 2018 to April 11, 2019, transgender individuals could enlist in the United States military under the condition of being stable for 18 months in their preferred or biological gender. On July 26, 2017, President Donald Trump announced on his Twitter page that transgender individuals would no longer be allowed \"to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military\", effectively reinstating the ban.\n\nFurther, throughout the US army, transgender people are still suffering from discrimination: they are prohibited from serving openly because of medical regulations that label them as mentally unstable. On the contrary, in Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom, as of 2010, when civil partnerships became legal in the respective countries, military family benefits followed the new laws, without discrimination.\n\nFear of discrimination may prevent military service members to be open about their sexual orientation. In some cases, in Belgium, homosexual personnel have been transferred from their unit if they have been \"too open with their sexuality.\" The Belgian military also continues to reserve the right to deny gay and lesbian personnel high-level security clearances, for fear they may be susceptible to blackmail. In 1993, a study showed that in Canada, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands and Norway, the number of openly homosexual service members was small, representing only a minority of homosexuals usually serving. Serving openly may make their service less pleasant or impede their careers, even though there were no explicit limitations to serve. Thus service members who acknowledged their homosexuality were \"appropriately\" circumspect in their behavior while in military situations; i.e. they did not call attention to themselves. Today, in the Danish army, LGBT military personnel refrain from being completely open about their homosexuality. Until training is completed and a solid employment is fixed they fear losing respect, authority and privileges, or in worse cases their job in the Danish army.\nIn 2010, the same updated study showed that in Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy and United Kingdom, no special treatment to prevent discrimination was in place in those armies, the issue is not specifically addressed, it is left to the leadership discretion. Commanders said that sexual harassment of women by men poses a far greater threat to unit performance than anything related to sexual orientation.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dutch military directly addressed the issue of enduring discrimination, by forming the Homosexuality and Armed Forces Foundation, a trade union that continues to represent gay and lesbian personnel to the ministry of defense, for a more tolerant military culture. Although homosexuals in the Dutch military rarely experience any explicitly aggressive acts against them, signs of homophobia and cultural insensitivity are still present.\n\nPhysical, sexual, psychological (harassment, bullying) violence faced by LGBT is a fact of life for many LGBT identified persons. In an inherently violent environment, LGBT people may face violence unique to their community in the course of military service.\n\nFor instance, the Israeli Defense Force does not ask the sexual orientation of its soldiers, however half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence and homophobia. LGBT soldiers are often victims of verbal and physical violence and for the most part, commanders ignore the phenomenon.\n\nSAPRO, the organization responsible for the oversight of the Department of Defense (DoD - USA) sexual assault policy, produces the \"Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Member (WGRA)\": The 2012 report doesn't have any paragraph studying the specific situation of LGBT people. The study focuses on men and women. The specificity of the violence faced by LGBT people is not considered.\n\nIn the Australian army, the problem is not known officially; only a few cases of harassment and discrimination involving gays and lesbians have been recorded. A researcher mentioned that \"one would not want to be gay and in the military\": Although there has been no major public scandal regarding harassment of gays, this does not mean that such behavior does not occur, but it has been under-studied. Generally, however, incidents of discrimination or harassment brought to the attention of commanders are handled appropriately, incidents in which peers who had made inappropriate remarks are disciplined by superiors promptly and without reservation.\n\nIn the United States, despite policy changes allowing for open LGBQ military service and the provision of some benefits to same-sex military couples, cultures of homophobia and discrimination persist.\n\nSeveral academics have written on the effects on employees in non-military contexts concealing their sexual orientation in the workplace. Writers on military psychology have linked this work to the experiences of LGBQ military service personnel, asserting that these studies offer insights into the lives of open LGBQ soldiers and those who conceal their orientation. Sexual orientation concealment and sexual orientation linked harassment are stressors for LGBT individuals that lead to negative experiences and deleterious job-related outcomes. Specifically, non-open LGBT persons are found to experience social isolation. In particular these products of work related stress can affect military job performance, due to the high reliance on connection and support for the well-being of all service members.\n\nIn the United States LGBQ soldiers are not required to disclose their sexual orientation, suggesting that some LGBQ service members may continue to conceal their sexual orientation. Studies suggest this could have harmful effects for the individual. A 2013 study conducted at the University of Montana found that non-open LGB US veterans face significantly higher rates of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol or other substance abuse than their heterosexual counterparts. These veterans also reported facing significant challenges serving while concealing their sexual orientation; 69.3% of subjects in the study reported experiencing fear or anxiety as a result of concealing their sexual identity, and 60.5% reported that those experiences led to a more difficult time for the respondent than heterosexual colleagues. This study also concludes that 14.7% of LGB American veterans made serious attempts at suicide. This rate of suicide attempts compares to another study of the entire American veteran community that found .0003% of American veterans attempt suicide.\n\nEvidence suggests that for LGB service members in the United States, the conditions of service and daily life have improved dramatically following the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Soldiers who choose to come out experience feelings of liberation, and report that no longer having to hide their orientation allows them to focus on their jobs. Support groups for LGB soldiers have also proliferated in the United States.\n\nUntil recently, many countries banned gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces. The reasons to enforce this ban included the potential negative impact on unit cohesion and privacy concerns. However, many studies commissioned to examine the effects on the military found that little evidence existed to support the discriminatory policy. Moreover, when the bans were repealed in several countries including the UK, Canada, and Australia, no large scale issues arose as a result.\n\nIn fact, several studies provide evidence that allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the armed forces can result in more positive work related outcomes. Firstly, discharging trained military personnel for their sexual orientation is costly and results in loss of talent. The total cost for such discharges in the U.S for violating the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy amounted to more than 290 million dollars. Secondly, privacy for service members has actually increased in countries with inclusive policies and led to a decrease in harassment. Although, it is important to note that many gays and lesbians do not disclose their sexual orientation once the ban is repealed. Finally, allowing gays to openly serve ends decades of discrimination in the military and can lead to a more highly qualified pool of recruits. For instance, the British military reduced its unfilled position gap by more than half after allowing gays to openly serve.\nTherefore, more evidence exists now to support policies that allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military.\n\nThe arguments against allowing openly gay servicemen and women in the military abound. While most research data have all but debunked traditional arguments in favor of policies like Don't Ask, Don't Tell, homosexuality is still perceived by most countries to be incompatible with military service.\n\nA recurrent argument for a ban on homosexuals in the military rests on the assumption that, in the face of potentially homosexual members of their unit, prospective recruits would shy away from military service. Based on an inconclusive study produced by the RAND Corporation in the run-up to the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, American military recruits were expected to decrease by as much as 7%. However, this does not appear to have materialized.\n\nIn a line of work that regularly demands that personnel be in close living quarters, allowing openly homosexual servicemen is argued to flout a fundamental tenet of military service: ensuring that soldiers remain undistracted from their mission. If gay men are allowed to shower with their fellow male soldiers, so goes the argument, this would, in effect, violate the \"unique conditions\" of military life by putting sexually compatible partners in close proximity, with potentially adverse effects on retention and morale of troops. Testimony advanced during the hearings on Don't Ask, Don't Tell of 1993, with US Senator Sam Nunn and General Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. recalled \"instances where heterosexuals have been solicited to commit homosexual acts, and, even more traumatic emotionally, physically coerced to engage in such acts\".\n\nMilitary historian Mackubin Thomas Owens conjectured in an Op-Ed for \"The Wall Street Journal\" that gay men and women would be partial to their lovers in the heat of battle. \"Does a superior order his or her beloved into danger,\" Owens asks, \"if he or she demonstrates favoritism, what is the consequence for unit morale and discipline? What happens when jealousy rears its head?\" Owens echoes the fear that allowing gay soldiers would be deleterious to unit cohesion on the battlefield, arguing that concern for one's lover in a given unit could override any sense of loyalty to the unit as a whole, particularly in situations of life and death.\n\nOwens further asserts that homosexuality may be incompatible with military service because it undermines the very ethos of a military, that is, one of nonsexual \"friendship, comradeship or brotherly love\".\n\nTony Perkins of the Family Research Council, a socially conservative advocacy organization, believes that allowing openly homosexual soldiers threatens the religious liberty of servicemen who disapprove of homosexuality for religious reasons.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Two ships have been built, with and both being commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force in July 2004. This class features a stealthy hull and significantly improved air defence systems, an area that had been a major weakness on previous ships designed by China. These ships represent a major improvement over older generation vessels and reflects the PLAN's need for more modern destroyer designs.\n\nThe Type 052B (\"Guangzhou\" class) multirole missile destroyer was the first Chinese-built warship capable of area air defence. When domestic systems could not be ready in time for Type 051B destroyer, China was forced to purchase two pairs of Sovremennyy-class destroyer to fill the gap left behind in the fleet area air defense. By the time of Type 052B, China had already gained tremendous experience from Russian systems and Chinese domestic systems were also ready. As a result, Type 052B is built with considerable Russian technology including the Russian-made 9M38 Buk-M1-2 (NATO codename: SA-N-12 Grizzly) air defence missile system, an extremely effective air defence system with a range of 38 km. Most military analysts expect the \"Guangzhou\" class to be similar to the Russian Sovremenny class destroyer in terms of general performance.\n\nThe modern capabilities of this vessel demonstrate the Chinese desire to build up their blue-water navy and ability to project force into deeper waters. This shows a strong internationally influencing naval force is being developed and will be a force to contend with in the future.\n\nThe displacement of the Type 052B is about 5850 tons standard and 6500 tons full load. The ship features a \"low point\" design and combines this with radar absorbing paint to reduce radar signature. The ship's funnel incorporates cooling devices to reduce infrared signatures. The stern flight deck can host a Kamov Ka-28 ASW helicopter. The chief designer of this class is the academician Mr. Pan Jingfu (潘镜芙), who is also the designer of the previous two classes.\n\nThe Type 052Bs incorporate an extensive array of weapons systems. She is equipped with two missile launchers, one forward and one aft on the ship. These launchers can launch the SA-N-12 Grizzly Surface-to-Air Missile. Each launcher has two dedicated MR-90 Front Dome fire control radars and carries a total of 48 missiles. The primary mission of Type 052B is providing area air defense for the fleet, so anti-shipping mission is secondary, which is handled by 4 quad YJ-83 Anti-Ship Cruise Missile launchers located amidships. For guns she has a 100mm cannon in 'A' position and this was also the first PLAN vessel to be equipped with a Close-In Weapons System. For sub-surface threats, she is armed with 2 triple 324mm Yu-7 Anti-Submarine torpedo tubes and two Type 75 twelve-barrel 240mm antisubmarine rocket launchers. The Type 052B is equipped with four 18-barrel Type 724 chaff launchers for part of its self-defense suite. No 169 was used a testbed for domestic gas turbine propulsion system, with one of the original DN80 gas turbine replaced by domestic Chinese produced QC-280, and experienced showed that domestic Chinese engine has performed satisfactorily.\n\nThe Type 052B uses either a Fregat-MAE-5 (Top Plate) 3D search radar or a Type 382 Radar (Upgraded version from Type 381 Radar \"Sea Eagle S/C\") 3D air/surface search radar, mounted at the top of the forward mast. Four MR90 Front-Dome radars provide fire control for the SA-N-12 missiles. A Type 344 fire control radar controls the main gun. A bandstand radar provides fire control for the YJ-83 ASCM missile.\n\n\n"}

He served as military officer in the United States Army during several wars, accompanied John C. Frémont on his second expedition through the West, and was instrumental in the formation of the government of the Oregon Territory. As a politician and writer, he was an inveterate believer in Manifest Destiny and was a visionary booster of new settlement to the West, helping lay the groundwork in his writings for a modern theory of the succession of civilizations.\n\nGilpin served as the first governor of the Colorado Territory. His administration was consumed largely with the defense of the new territory in the early days of the American Civil War and was brought down after only one year by scandalous financial dealings. After the demise of his political career, he made a large fortune as a land speculator in New Mexico, although his dealings were questionable and possibly illegal.\n\nGilpin was born near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania a son of Joshua Gilpin, a merchant and paper maker. They were a wealthy family of Quakers. He was educated by private tutors and studied abroad in England for two years before attending the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1833. He attended West Point from 1834 to 1835, but did not graduate.\n\nHe received a commission as second lieutenant with the 2nd Dragoon Regiment in June 1836 and served in the Seminole Wars. He also served as a recruiter in Missouri. While in Missouri, he became attracted to opportunities on the frontier and to the idea of westward expansion of the nation. After resigning in April 1838, he moved to St. Louis where he became a newspaper editor and opened a law practice. After three years in St. Louis, he moved across the state to Independence, where he interacted with emigrants about to embark on the Oregon Trail.\n\nIn 1843 he encountered John C. Frémont along the Santa Fe Trail and embarked westward with Frémont on his expedition to find a route over the continental divide. While passing through the region of present-day Colorado, he encountered evidence of placer gold in the region, but the information would go unused for at least another decade. When the party reached Walla Walla in the Oregon Country, Gilpin continued westward on his own while Frémont continued on to California. At the time, the Oregon Country was under joint administration by the United States and the United Kingdom, but in practical terms it was controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver.\n\nGilpin settled among the growing community of U.S. settlers in the Willamette Valley and became active in the organization of a provisional government. At the landmark convention at Champoeg, he helped draft a petition requesting support for the provisional government from the United States Congress. Gilpin himself was charged with carrying the Willamette petition back east. On his way back through Missouri, he helped publicize the Pacific Northwest and stir up \"Oregon fever\". He delivered the petition to Congress in 1845, then wrote memoirs of his travels in the Pacific Northwest to emphasize its potential for trade and settlement.\n\nIn 1846, during the Mexican–American War, he was commissioned as Major of the 1st Missouri Mounted Infantry Regiment and marched to Chihuahua City in the successful bloodless campaign to capture New Mexico. He was considered to have served with distinction in the campaign and was later given command of a mounted infantry battalion to protect the Santa Fe Trail against attacks by Native Americans. Gilpin was also involved with the ill-fated Fort Mann, just west of what is now Dodge City, Kansas. The man Gilpin put in charge of the post created havoc and Gilpin attempted to rectify some of the problems caused there.\n\nAfter the end of the war in 1848, he returned to Missouri and resumed his law practice. He made an unsuccessful attempt at a political career while in Missouri as well. In 1859, Gilpin's early intuition about gold in Colorado proved correct, and the region suddenly became the target for thousands of eager and hopeful prospectors in the ensuing Colorado Gold Rush.\n\nThat year, Gilpin published a futurist history of the region, called \"The Central Gold Region\", in which he wrote, \"the destiny of the American people is to subdue the continent\". In the book he predicted that the Mississippi River valley would become the center of western civilization with the new settlement of Denver as its capital, based partly on its location near the 40th parallel north. In the book, Gilpin envisioned that all the great cities of the world along that latitude would eventually be linked by railroad lines and proposed a rail line over the Bering Strait connecting North America and Asia.\n\nThroughout his career in politics, Gilpin was a strong believer that the American West would not only be settled but also eventually hold an enormous population. He was a particularly strong advocate of the now-debunked climatological theory of \"Rain follows the plow\". This theory held that settlement in the arid lands of the West would actually increase rainfall in the region, making it as fertile and green as the Eastern United States.\n\nIn the early 1860s the crisis in Kansas prompted Gilpin to join the Republican Party, putting him at odds with many citizens of Missouri. His political alignment with the new administration of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was rewarded in 1861 when Lincoln appointed him governor of the newly formed Territory of Colorado. His selection over the local favorite William Larimer came as a surprise to many, and was motivated in part by the fact that Gilpin was backed by the Governor of Missouri, a slave state that Lincoln was eager to keep in the Union.\n\nThe US Government's Official Register for 1861 lists Gilpin as both Governor of Colorado (at a salary of $1,500 a year) and as governor and ex officio superintendent of the Indian Office's Colorado Superintendency ($2,500 a year).\n\nGovernor Gilpin left Missouri and arrived in Denver City on May 29, 1861, to cheering crowds. Despite his warm reception, his administration was plagued with difficulties from the outset. The territory had been organized at the start of the Civil War and faced a complex set of threats, including Confederate sympathizers within the territory, the possibility of a Confederate invasion from outside, and looming tensions with Native Americans (in particular the Arapaho and Cheyenne) in the wake of the withdrawal of U.S. Army troops in the region for other duties.\n\nThe imminent threats facing the territory prompted Gilpin to act quickly without receiving authorization from the federal government. He appointed a territorial military staff and, despite having no funds for military purposes, he began to solicit volunteers for a military regiment. Without funds, he took the daring step of issuing $375,000 in drafts on the federal treasury, with the expectation that the federal government would honor them later. He later claimed that he had received verbal authorization from Lincoln for issuing the drafts before leaving for Colorado.\n\nAt first, most of the merchants and citizens of the territory were willing to support Gilpin's fundraising campaign, but doubt began to spread through the territory after rumors from Washington, DC confirmed that the federal government did not intend to validate the drafts. By the summer of 1861, many of the citizens of the territory were in an uproar, and petitions were circulated calling for Gilpin's removal from office. The movement against him was fostered by the anger of William N. Byers, the powerful editor of the \"Rocky Mountain News\", whose newspaper had been bypassed in favor of a rival in the awarding of the territorial printing contract. Under attack in his own state, Gilpin went to Washington to plead his case for the validation of the drafts. Despite the controversy, the funds already raised from the drafts allowed the creation of the 1st Colorado Volunteers, widely derided as \"Gilpin's Pet Lambs\". The regiment trained in the summer and fall of 1861 at Camp Weld near Denver.\n\nThe mustering and training of the regiment proved highly useful when the Confederates launched an invasion northward through the New Mexico Territory in the spring of 1862. The invasion, today called the New Mexico Campaign, aimed to seize the mineral-rich Colorado Territory and eventually California. The 1st Colorado Volunteers played a critical role in repelling the Confederates, routing the Texans at the Battle of Glorieta Pass, which became known as the \"Gettysburg of the West\".\n\nDespite the enormous success of the regiment, the territory was mired in financial problems caused by Gilpin's drafts, which had tied up most of the circulating currency without any resolution regarding their validation. Eventually the federal treasury settled the drafts after being presented with itemized statements by their holders. The resolution came too late for Gilpin, on May 21,1862 Lincoln removed him from the governorship of the territory and replaced him with John Evans.\n\nIn 1863, Gilpin and a syndicate of foreign investors bought the Charles H. Beaubien land grant (often referred to as the Sangre de Cristo Land Grant on the east slopes of the mountains) in southeast Colorado for about 4 cents an acre ($41,000). Gilpin and his investors then tried to evict residents on the property. Litigation over the property continues to this day. He was also one of the early owners of the Luis Maria Baca Grant No. 4.\n\nHe died in 1894 in Denver, Colorado after being run over by a horse and buggy and was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery (Wheat Ridge) in Jefferson County, Colorado.\n\n\n"}

W. Scripps Company, that operated from 1978 to 2011. It syndicated 150 comics and editorial columns worldwide. Its core businesses were the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association.\n\nE. W. Scripps started his newspaper career in the 1885, and owned 22 newspapers by 1910. In 1897, he created two companies, the Scripps-McRae Press Association and the Scripps News Association. In 1907, he combined a number of news providers into United Press Associations as a rival to Associated Press.\n\nOn June 2, 1902, the new Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), based in Cleveland, Ohio, started as a news report service for different Scripps-owned newspapers. It started selling content to non-Scripps owned newspapers in 1907, and by 1909, it became a more general syndicate, offering comics, pictures and features as well. At that time, it had some 100 features available.\n\nUnited Feature Syndicate was formed in 1919. It became a dominant player in the syndication market in the early 1930s. In March 1930, United Features acquired the Metropolitan Newspaper Service (ostensibly from the Bell Syndicate). And in late February 1931, Scripps acquired the \"New York World\", which controlled the syndication arms of the Pulitzer company: World Feature Service and Press Publishing Co. (which unlike other syndicates were owned by the paper rather than being separate entities). An April 1933 article in \"Fortune\" described United Feature as one of the \"Big Four\" American syndicates (along with King Features Syndicate, Chicago Tribune Syndicate, and the Bell Syndicate). United Features and NEA both became successful distributors of newspaper comics in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1972, United Features Syndicate acquired and absorbed the North American Newspaper Alliance and the Bell-McClure Syndicate into its operations.\n\nIn May 1978 Scripps merged United Features and NEA to form United Media Enterprises (UM).\n\nIn 1992, United Media donated the Robert Roy Metz Collection of 83,034 original cartoons by 113 cartoonists to the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum.\n\nIn 1994, Jim Davis's company, Paws, Inc., purchased the rights to \"Garfield\" (including the strips from 1978 to 1993) from United Feature. The strip is currently distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, while rights for the strip remain with Paws.\n\nOn June 3, 2010, United Media sold their licensing arm, along with the rights to \"Peanuts\" and \"Dilbert\", to Iconix Brand Group.\n\nThe Scripps Howard News Service (SHNS) (established 1917) was part of United Media; SHNS went defunct in 2013.\n\nOn February 24, 2011, United Media struck a distribution deal with Universal Uclick (now known as Andrews McMeel Syndication) for syndication of the company's 150 comic strip and news features, which became effective on June 1 of that year. Of the more than 40 comic strips United Media transferred to Universal Uclick, about 75% of them were United Features strips (as opposed to Newspaper Enterprise Association strips). While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.\n\nFrom 1999 until its 2011 takeover by Universal Uclick, United Media used the Comics.com domain to promote their existing syndicated strips as well as promote new strips and the burgeoning realm of webcomics. (Comics.com also featured editorial cartoons, \"The New Yorker\" cartoons, Snoopy.com, and Dilbert.com.) The site, however, never worked the way it was planned. As cartoonist and former UM editor of acquisitions and development Ted Rall wrote, Comics.com \"was the laughingstock of the industry, full of Javascript gone wild, 404 errors and broken widgets.\" According to Rall, outgoing UM President Doug Stern told his employees \"that part of the failure of UM was directly attributable to the company's inability to make money online, that they had tried their best but failed.\" Many involved with the company said that was not the case. Universal Uclick/Andrews McMeel Syndication took over the Comics.com domain, which currently redirects to GoComics.com, the web's largest catalog of syndicated newspaper strips, political cartoons and webcomics, offering free new content every day.\n\n\n\nThese were published on United Media's site and/or Comics.com; many moved to GoComics:\n\n\n\n"}

In June 2019, it was announced that the show would be returning for a new season on November 16, 2019 on Motor Trend.\n\nThe show's hosts were automobile designer Chip Foose and co-host Chris Jacobs; the creator and producer was Bud Brutsman.

Each show ended with the surprise reuniting of owner and newly made-over car.\n\nEach episode would take a significant amount of planning, starting with the producers reviewing the thousands of submissions from those wanting to have a friend's or family member's vehicle overhauled, selecting a deserving person, and setting everything in motion. Most builds would take place in Southern California, and true to the show's premise, the team would have only eight days to complete the build. Up to sixty people could be involved at any one time with the show. According to Associate Producer Jim Holloway, the show would assemble a team of seven or eight \"A-Team\" volunteer builders about four to five days before taping would start. The builders, who were usually masters of their craft, \"work[ed] together... [with] a sense of camaraderie amongst them.\" Sometimes builders would leave the build, causing Chip Foose to request help from a friend or cohort to help the team finish. Holloway noted that \"we couldn't do the show without the builders or our sponsors.\" The set would have the names and logos of various sponsors, many of whom often helped with the build.\n\nOnce the project was chosen and scheduled, the show's major sponsors would ship parts to the build facility in advance of the show, while other sponsors would maintain a small on-site inventory. This would allow such items as air-filter housings, tire sizes, and so on to be test fit without having to wait for shipments.\n\nAccording to Holloway, each completed vehicle is worth around $150,000, but \"in reality, they're priceless... Chip's so busy that it's almost impossible to get a car from the Foose shop, no matter how much money you've got.\" In an interview, Foose said that \"for me, seeing the look on the owner's face is the most rewarding part of the show. It's almost overwhelming to see their response, and it's the whole reason I do it. We worked hard to make their dream come true.\" \n\nIn 2006, the show remodeled a 1993 Hummer H1 that CNN used to cover the war in Iraq. Over a one-week period, the \"Overhaulin\"' crew replaced the engine, raised the vehicle's body and air brushed images of correspondents and troops onto the Hummer. They also added a DVD player, four televisions and a state-of-the-art sound system. TLC unveiled the revamped Hummer, named \"Warrior One,\" in front of a swarm of fans, media and CNN employees. According to co-host Chris Jacobs, \"we wanted to commemorate the journalists who risked their lives, and in some cases, gave their lives to tell the story of the war.\"\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in CNN Center in Atlanta, and was sold in 2007 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction for $1,000,000.00 in a Fisher House Foundation charity lot.\n\nVelocity by Discovery renewed the show to help fill its programming schedule. Season 6 premiered on October 2, 2012 and concluded June 2, 2013. The revived show was produced by WATV Productions, who also produced two other Chip Foose-hosted series for Velocity, \"American Icon: The Hot Rod\" and \"American Icon: The Muscle Car\". On October 12, 2015, a series finale was announced that a ninth season would be its last, consisting of four episodes.\n\nIn this episode (Season 6, Episode 5), Chip Foose and his \"A\" Team customized a 2012 Chrysler 300 S with 5.7L HEMI V8 engine into Foose Velocity 300 in front of live 2012 SEMA Show audience. After the build, the project vehicle was given away in a lottery held during the event. An additional 300S replica was produced and given away at a later date.\n\n"}
{"id": "1918257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918257", "title": "Cardiff Bus", "text": "Cardiff Bus\n\nCardiff Bus () is the dominant operator of bus services in Cardiff, Wales and the surrounding area, including Barry and Penarth. The company is wholly owned by Cardiff Council and is one of the few municipal bus companies to remain in council ownership.\n\nWhile horse buses (and later horse trams) had run in the city since 1845, Cardiff Bus can trace its history back to May 1902, when Cardiff Council took over and electrified a tram line between Roath and the city centre. It had been previously run by the Cardiff Tramway Company. The resultant Cardiff Corporation Tramways spent the next three decades extending its electric tram network, and at its peak in 1927 ran 141 electric trams over 18 miles of line. On Christmas Eve 1920, the corporation introduced its first bus, although the first motor bus route was operated by the Tramway Company from 1907.\n\nThe first Cardiff trolleybuses were introduced in 1942, their introduction having been delayed by the outbreak of World War II. The intention was to convert the remaining tramway system to trolleybus operation, then to extend the network. While the first stage was completed in 1950, the only extension made to the system was to Ely which took place in 1955. Although powers had been obtained to considerably expand the network, a policy U-turn occurred in 1961 when the decision was made to replace all the trolleybuses with motor buses. This task was completed in 1970, bringing to an end 68 years of electric traction on the streets of Cardiff.\n\nThe Transport Act of 1985 deregulated bus services outside London and required all Local Authorities to establish private \"arm's length\" bus companies. In October 1986 the council established a subsidiary company. In 1992, the closure of the National Welsh bus company led Cardiff Bus to extend and intensify its network in the areas and towns surrounding Cardiff, including Barry, the Vale of Glamorgan and Caerphilly. The Caerphilly local network of services including links between Cardiff, Caerphilly, Blackwood and Tredegar were discontinued in 2001 and are now provided by Stagecoach in South Wales.\n\nSome loss-making services have been withdrawn and are now operated under local authority tender by other operators, including Watts Coaches and NAT Group.\n\nFrom September 2016, four of Cardiff Bus' services (routes 51/53, 86 and X91) were transferred to its new Capital Links sister brand, with a further four services transferring over to Capital Links two months later. Vehicles used on these services are in either an orange or green base livery, and as of July 2017, Capital Links operate seven routes.\n\nCardiff Bus has a turnover of £27million, employs around 705 people, on an average weekday carries around 100,000 passengers. In 2009 the company started to operate the park and ride service from Cardiff City Stadium to the city centre.\n\nCardiff Bus operates an exact fare policy and no change is given. The city used to be divided into four fare zones, but on 5 April 2009, Cardiff Bus introduced a flat fare of £1.60 for a one-way journey or £3.20 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or £1.40/£2.80 for travel within Barry. This has since been increased to £2.00 for a one-way journey or £4.00 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or £1.90 and £3.80 in Barry (£3.20/£5.50 Cardiff and Barry). A weekly ticket can be purchased for travel within Cardiff for £15, but an \"iff card\" will need to be presented as this type of ticket is not printed out on their machine. Tickets can also be purchased on the mobile app (available for iOS and Android).\nSpecial fares apply for travel between Cardiff and Barry. Special fares also apply for Newport, with a £4.50 return ticket offered along with the Day to Go Plus ticket also being accepted.\n\nIff card is a contactless smart card introduced by Cardiff Bus in October 2010, allowing customers to travel on its services after having pre-paid. The first 30,000 cards were issued free of charge and preloaded with £3 of credit, after which the cards will be charged at £5.\n\nAn amount of money is electronically loaded onto the card, either upon boarding a bus or at the Cardiff Bus customer service centre. A passenger then chooses a ticket type. The card can also be used as a season ticket. The card should be topped-up when the balance is low, however, the card allows the customer to acquire a negative balance up to £3.\n\nThe card can be topped-up in units of £1, £2, £3, £4, £5, £10, £15 or £20, up to maximum amount of £50. The card may be used by persons aged between 6 and 60. The Iff card cannot be used to pay a partial amount. The card is cancelled if not used for a continuous period of one year.\n\nIn March 2018 the company introduced the Ticketer contactless card payment system on all its routes. As well as including an EFTPOS reader for Visa/Mastercard cards, fares can be bought and scanned using the Cardiff Bus app (which on most tickets including day to go and week to go tickets is cheaper than using cash). The reader can also scan QR codes from paper multi-journey tickets.\n\nAs of August 2018, the fleet consists of 224 vehicles, all of which are low floor. Single deck vehicles dominate the fleet, accounting for 90.7% of the overall fleet. Since 2013, 90 brand new vehicles have been purchased, with the most recent being delivered in August 2017.\n\nOn the double deck side of the fleet, of which there are 23 vehicles, ten high capacity Alexander Dennis Enviro400s joined the fleet in 2015. Prior to the delivery of the former, thirteen East Lancs Olympus bodied Scania N230UDs entered service in 2007.\n\nThe most common single deck type is the Pointer-bodied Alexander Dennis/Dennis/TransBus Dart SLF, with 72 vehicles of three different lengths in the fleet. The second most common type is the Scania OmniCity, with 43 in total. Nineteen of the OmniCitys are the articulated variant.\n\nThe Alexander Dennis Enviro200 also dominates, with 40 examples in the fleet, including ten with the \"MMC\" body. The Mercedes-Benz Citaro has become the standard large single deck type in recent years, with 40 Citaros in service as of August 2017. Operated in smaller numbers are the TransBus Enviro300, with twelve examples, and seven Wright Solar bodied Scania K230UBs.\n\nAlthough the predominant colour of Cardiff is blue, the original branding in both the entire tram, trolley bus and early bus operations until the 1970s was crimson lake and cream livery. This then changed to orange with white lining, from August 1972 with \"City of Cardiff\" on the left hand side and \"Dinas Caerdydd\" on the right hand side. This changed in 1986 when the business became Cardiff Bus. However, since the 1990s the dominant colouring has been green, first with cream lining and since the introduction of modern wrapping, a return for orange in the adjustments/outline.\n\nJust before the introduction of the Iff Card, the company started a \"your bus service\" campaign, fronted by a series of local people's faces being applied in large scale on the sides and rears of selected buses.\n\nBus 472 had a grey vinyl wrapped livery advertising the IFF card following its launch in 2008. It was then repainted into a heritage orange and white livery to celebrate 30 years since the formation of Cardiff Bus (after the 1986 deregulation of buses) and it currently sports a vinyl wrap celebrating Cardiff's sporting success with Cardiff City Football Club, Cardiff Blues, Cardiff Devils ice hockey team and Gerraint Thomas winning the Tour De France.\n\nCardiff Bus's dominant position has sometimes come in for criticism and investigation. In 2004, 2Travel, a company operating significant numbers of school contract services in South Wales, launched low-cost services in Cardiff and Swansea to utilise its fleet between the school runs. Low fares were achieved by omitting major bus stations avoiding hefty access fees. Cardiff Bus launched a basic service in competition with 2Travel, using white buses bearing no livery also stopping short of the bus station. The Office of Fair Trading launched an investigation in 2007 into claims of predatory behaviour 18 months after 2Travel had ceased trading and gone into liquidation. The investigation found that Cardiff Bus had engaged in predatory behaviour.\n\nDifferent branding worn by Cardiff Bus vehicles.\n\nThe different liveries used by Cardiff Bus to the present day.\n\n\n"}

These borders were the result of the Occupation of the Baltic States, Eastern Poland and Bessarabia in 1940.\n\nThe line stretched from the Baltic Sea to the Carpathian Mountains. It was made up of thirteen fortified regions, most covering about 100 km of the border. It was a part of the larger Soviet defence network along its western borders, stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea.\n\nEach fortified region (in Russian \"ukreplennyi raion\", or \"UR\") consisted of a large number of concrete bunkers (pillboxes) armed with machineguns, antitank guns and artillery. The bunkers were built in groups for mutual support, each group forming a centre of resistance. A dedicated military unit was permanently assigned to man each region.\n\nWhen Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941 during the course of Operation Barbarossa, most of the line was not yet finished, and hence posed a negligible obstacle to the invading forces. Only the four southernmost regions, partly completed, were able to hamper the advance of the Wehrmacht for a few days. (The Brest Fortress resisted much longer, but it was an older fortification technically not part of the Molotov line).\n\nThe ruins of these fortifications, many of them well preserved, can be found today in Lithuania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine. The modern borders are somewhat different from the borders in 1941, and hence some sections of the line do not lie in border zones and are easily accessible. On the other hand, other sections do lie right along the modern Polish-Ukrainian, Polish-Belarusian and Lithuanian-Russian borders, so access to them may still be restricted for reasons of border security.\n\nIn Lithuania the line consisted of four fortified regions:\n\nOverall 101 bunkers were built in Lithuania but many were not fully completed. They were significantly vulnerable and could be neutralised quickly by throwing grenades or burning fuel into periscope shafts, which were absolutely unprotected.\n\nContinuing south, the other regions, today located along the eastern border of Poland with Belarus and Ukraine, were:\n\nThe name \"Molotov Line\" is informal and has come into use relatively recently. It was popularised by the writings of Viktor Suvorov, notably by his book \"Icebreaker\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1918265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918265", "title": "Arturo Prat", "text": "Arturo Prat\n\nAgustín Arturo Prat Chacón (; April 3, 1848, near Ninhue, Chile – May 21, 1879, Iquique, Peru) was a Chilean lawyer and navy officer. He was killed in the Battle of Iquique, during the War of the Pacific.\n\nDuring his career, Prat had taken part in several naval engagements, including battles at Papudo (1865), and at the Abtao (1866). Following his death, his name became a rallying cry for Chilean forces, and Arturo Prat has since been considered a national hero.\n\nPrat's name is commemorated on numerous plazas (squares), streets, buildings and other structures in Chile. His name has been commemorated by four of Chile's major warships, including a in the 1950s, a British from 1983 to 2006, and most recently a Dutch transferred to Chile as \"Capitan Prat\" in 2006. One of Chile's Antarctic research facilities, Arturo Prat Station, and the Chilean Naval Academy, Escuela Naval Arturo Prat are named after him. His portrait appears on the 10,000 Chilean peso bank note. Also, in 1984 Arturo Prat University was founded, with its main campus in Iquique where his heroic deed took place.\n\nArturo Prat, the oldest of five brothers, (Ricardo, Rodolfo, Atala Rosa and Escilda Aurelia) son of Agustín Prat del Barril and Rosario Chacón Barrios, was born at the San Agustín de Puñual Hacienda in south-central Chile on April 3, 1848. The name Prat is of Catalan origin (not to be confused with the English 'Pratt'). He entered the Naval Academy on August 28, 1858 at the age of 10 years thanks to one of the scholarships created by President Manuel Montt, another son of Catalan immigrants. There were two scholarships per province: one for Arauco went to Prat, and the other went to Luis Uribe. Both had the same benefactor, Don Jacinto Chacón (uncle of Arturo and stepfather of Uribe), resulting in the two youths considering each other as brothers.\n\nAt the time, the academy was directed by the Frenchman Juan Julio Feillet and was backed by another Frenchman, Anatolio Desmadryl. Young Arturo and his friend Luis were part of the so-called \"class of the heroes\" including Carlos Condell, Juan José Latorre, and Jorge Montt Álvarez.\n\nIn 1859, his second year as a cadet, he commenced a nautical apprenticeship – a requirement for second-year students. His first voyage of training was completed in the steamer \"Independencia\", with sail and rigging maneuvers, followed later by practice in seamanship and artillery.\n\nIn January 1860, Prat boarded, for the first time, \"Esmeralda\". His nautical apprenticeship continued: embarkation and disembarkation, combat simulation, etc. In July 1861, he left the Naval Academy as \"\"primera antigüedad\"\" (the most distinguished in the course). He obtained the grade of \"midshipman without examination\".\n\nDuring this period, Prat distinguished himself in an incident involving \"Infernal\", a French ship that was carrying explosive materials. On October 1, 1861, it caught on fire while in the Bay of Valparaíso. \"Esmeralda\", which was nearby, sent boats to save the wreck, one of which was steered by Prat, who would struggle for two hours against the fire.\n\nOn July 21, 1864, Arturo Prat passed the theoretical and practical test needed to be promoted from \"midshipman without exam\" to \"examined midshipman\". That year saw the incidents that resulted in the war against Spain, inflamed by the Chilean attitude towards the occupation of the Peruvian Chincha Islands by a Spanish squadron. The resulting war would prove to be a baptism of fire for Prat and his classmates.\n\nCommanding \"Esmeralda\" at the time was Juan Williams Rebolledo, who planned the recovery of the Chilean steamer and the capture of the Spanish schooner \"Covadonga\". The naval battle of Papudo occurred on December 26 and rapidly went the way of the Chilean force which was superior in firepower and was able to capture the defeated ship. The capture of \"Covadonga\" resulted in the promotion by one grade of all sailors participating in the battle, converting Prat into an ensign (equivalent to a second lieutenant in the army).\n\nWishing to offset their losses at Papudo, the Spanish fleet sought another confrontation with the allied navies (Peru and Ecuador added to Chile's side). Their desire for vengeance was fulfilled at Chiloé in the battle of Abtao on February 7, 1866. Artillery combat occurred only between \"Covadonga\" and the Spanish ships \"Villa de Madrid\" and \"Blanca\", as the other allied ships were unused due to a lack of coal and the rocky estuary. Prat then served on \"Covadonga\", the ship which resisted the Spanish bombardment. There were no losses on the allied side, while the Spanish suffered two deaths.\n\nAfter the war, Prat completed a large number of sea voyages, both inside and outside his country, including voyages to the Juan Fernández Islands, Easter Island (on the corvette \"Esmeralda\" under Policarpo Toro's command), Magallanes and Peru. During the latter trip in 1868, he was responsible for transporting aid to those affected by that year's earthquake, and he later brought back the remains of Bernardo O'Higgins, at the orders of Manuel Blanco Encalada.\n\nPrat was promoted to a lieutenant on September 9. The future hero returned to Naval School, but this time as an instructor. From 1871, he was the Second Commander of \"Esmeralda\", leading to his appointment to several positions in the school (teacher, subdirector, internal director), and was assigned to teach courses such as Naval Order, Law, Naval Tactics and Cosmography. Additionally, he was responsible for docking the corvette for four years (1871–1874) in the port of Mejillones. He received the title of Graduated Corvette Captain (equivalent to lieutenant commander) in 1873 and in 1874. He was a dedicated teacher who fought against the lack of resources available to provide quality education. He himself translated textbooks from French to Spanish.\n\nAround that time, Prat faced an unusual situation. On May 24, 1875, \"Esmeralda\" was in the port of Valparaíso while Prat was on sick leave. The commander of the ship, Luis Alfredo Lynch, was also on leave so Lieutenant Constantino Bannen was left in charge. A storm began in the bay and \"Valdivia\" broke its ties and went right towards \"Esmeralda\", which then impacted with \"Maipo\". It appeared that the destruction of \"Esmeralda\" would be unavoidable. When Prat and Lynch returned, they managed to get transported back to the ship by boat, but the violent waves kept them from embarking. Arturo Prat threw himself into the water and swam to the ship to climb a rope (as Lynch had done just before him). He worked feverishly with a rope tied from his waist to the mast to accomplish rescue maneuvers resulting in the ship stopping with its bow against the beach and securing it there with rigging. Luis Alfredo Lynch would later remember Prat's \"unflappable calm in the face of danger\".\n\nThe repair of \"Esmeralda\" was long and hard and cost 100,000 pesos. Lynch had to face charges of dereliction of duty, however he was saved by a tie in the voting. Throughout the trial, Arturo Prat was always faithful to his superior, helping him however he could. \n\nAfter the tests of May 1876 and only three years before the War of the Pacific, the Chilean government closed the Naval School, saying that Chile no longer needed naval officers.\n\nPrat, who left Condell in charge of \"Esmeralda\", disembarked and, because of his studies in law, was named helper of the Maritime Government of Valparaíso. It was December 1876, he was already a graduated commander, but he would only return to the ship of his destiny once the war started.\n\nIn 1870, Prat began the path of becoming a lawyer. Prat had always had an interest in law and therefore decided to pursue his law degree. He entered as a secondary student in Humanities at the \"Liceo de Valparaíso\" and the National Institute (\"Instituto Nacional\"). In 1871, he received his diploma in Philosophy and Humanities — a prerequisite for studying law. One of his examiners was the renowned Chilean historian Diego Barros Arana.\n\nIn the following year, he began his studies in Property Law in the Faculty of Law of the University of Chile. He studied on board the \"Esmeralda\", which was located in Mejillones. Upon returning from his mission, he requested to take his examinations in Valparaíso where he passed the required subjects.\n\nIn 1875, he began practicing law at a law firm in the port town as a prerequisite to receiving his license.\n\nIn July of the following year, Prat passed his remaining courses and was then ready to complete his licensing. In order to graduate, he was required to pass an examination on a randomly chosen area of law. He was assigned Roman Law, which he managed to pass between 24–26 July 1876, while his thesis \"\"Observaciones sobre la ley electoral vigente\"\" (Observations on the current electoral law) was approved. There remained one final step before receiving his license — a final exam before the judges of the Supreme Court.\n\nOn 31 July 1876, at 11 a.m., the lieutenant commander passed through the corridors of Supreme Court of Justice in full dress uniform wearing his sword at his belt; he had come to take his examination before the highest judges, the final requirement to practise law. However, much to his surprise, Prat was told that the judges had decided not to hear examinations that day. Prat protested that he had an appointment for that day, that he had very little free time as a naval officer, and requested a meeting with Manuel Montt Torres, the Supreme Court president. Having convinced Montt to receive him, and to much applause from the court, Prat went on to become a lawyer at the age of 28.\n\nPrior to his final exam, Prat had already conducted legal work while defending the engineer Ricardo Owen, accused of disobedience, and also his friend and classmate Luis Uribe, accused of disobedience and contempt to his superiors. He succeeded the first time, but he was not so successful with the defence of his friend, who was condemned to six months of jail by six votes. The amnesty of the President saved Uribe and his naval career from that fate.\n\nPrat practised his recently adopted profession for a very short time. He primarily devoted himself to resolving the legal problems of the Chacón and Carvajal families, as well as naval-related problems.\n\nHe aspired to be a Navy auditor, but he was only sworn as \"assistant\" (mainly because of his lack of experience), assigned the legal aspects of the Navy General Command. Prat performed a complete remodeling of the army's legal system, starting with the Navigation Law. He presented 152 modifications to it, many of which were approved. He was also in charge of the regularization of the promotion system, proposing changes to avoid social relations, politics and other factors, making it a merit and seniority based system. Prat died without this navy code having been published.\n\nThis was Arturo Prat's thesis book, which contained many clues about his political thoughts. It was written within the framework of the promulgation of the new electoral law during Federico Errázuriz Zañartu's government, in which the \"Greater Taxpayer Institution\" and \"Parliament Member Cumulative Vote\" were established.\n\nPrat analyzes this law with the perspective that it would make possible further progress towards electoral freedom. He points out the contradictions and obscurity of the text, but he stresses that it is an \"eminently liberal\" law. Prat ends saying: \"...deep-down a good law, it needs serious and important reforms with respect to regulations if it is to achieve the lofty objective it is destined to: to be the effective guarantee that the voting result is the happy expression of the national will.\"\n\nThe text reveals Prat's political ideas, clearly reflecting the common liberalism of the times, and demonstrates a great naivety (not even with all of its indications could the law prevent the intervention of the executive power.)\n\nPedro Chacón used to throw parties in his portside house once or twice a week. Prat frequently attended, as did Concepción Chacón's sister-in-law, Carmela Carvajal. In those happy get-togethers the couple met and fell in love, a love that would last a lifetime.\n\nTheir attraction was obvious, but Prat was concerned when others mentioned it. In addition to his shyness, he was annoyed because he was afraid to formalize an engagement because he had no money to support the marriage.\n\nWhen he learned that he would be promoted to Corvette Captain, he finally decided to ask for Carmela's hand, in 1873. The only love letter from Prat to his fiancée that has survived is dated shortly after:\nMy Carmela, my life, my treasure, I have to tell you, that I adore you every day more fervently, I cannot do it now because I am afraid I could fall ill. Receive the passionate heart of your Arturo.\n\nOn 5 May 1873 the wedding bells sounded over the San Agustín de Valparaíso church. A beautiful red carpet was laid, over which the radiant 22-year-old bride passed on her way to the altar. Her parents had died when she was a girl, and she had been raised by her siblings, through whom she had contact with the Chacón family. The Chacón adopted her as a member of the family. Tall, slender and beautiful, she met with a sturdy Arturo Prat, with large forehead due to his baldness, thick beard and steady step. The minister, José Francisco Salas, blessed them at 10:30 am. They were married.\nTheir relationship as spouses was based on a love that did not fade during the six years they lived together. Prat treated his wife as an equal, as a partner (something really rare in that society), putting her in charge of the family budget; and he, on the other hand, helped with some house chores: \"At every moment I seem to find you exhausted from rocking our daughter, without me being next to you and sharing, albeit a bit, your labors...\".\n\nThe newlyweds spent their honeymoon in Quillota and in the Cauquenes's hot springs. After that, Prat returned to Valparaíso to resume his navy duties. He did not see his wife again until October. By that time Carmela was already pregnant with their first daughter. Prat wrote of his daughter's birth:\nThe fifth of march Carmela de la Concepción was born at 9:35 a.m., under the circumstances that I had to go to Santiago just the day before... The fifth of April she was baptised in the Church of the Holy Spirit, the godparents being Conchita with José Jesús...\nIt seems to me that she was to be very vivacious, smiling, playful... Last night I dreamt about her and she seemed to know me and with her little face a bit sad, she extended her little arms to hug me...\n\nBut like Prat's older brothers who died very young, the girl inherited a very frail and sickly build. Arturo writes to Carmela: \"\"Keep using homeopathy for my little daughter and inform me after she is healthy.\"\" He has, undoubtedly, the hope that the method that (he supposed) cured his weak condition, would work the same wonders in little Carmela. But it didn't work, the child's life was extinguishing more and more every day, to the despair of the helpless parents, who put all their strengths in their prayers.\nPoor little angel! I cannot see her any more, at least I want her to be healthy.\n\nCarmelita's problem was a hernia caused by the badly removed umbilical cord, in addition to several other illnesses (diarrhea, fever, etc.)\n\nAdding to Prat's despair, at the end of the annual season, he had to be transferred to the center of the country, on the \"Abtao\", a steamer that should have arrived but had not. On Sunday 13 December the boat finally arrived, and he wrote to his wife: \"Later then I will be seeing you, as I will see my little child who I hope is completely healthy...\" But the girl had died one week before on 5 December. At dusk, a devastating letter arrived from his wife: \"My beloved Arturo, our dear little angel is still not well; I feel my heart fainting from pain and you are not here to hold me... If it were possible for you to come, that would be my only comfort. Don't despair my wellbeing, think of your unhappy Carmela.\" Adding to Prat's desperation, the steamboat would not leave until the 18th.\n\nAll his hopes were destroyed in that trip, days later, when he was given a condolence letter in an intermediate port, signed by Juan José Latorre. Arturo wrote at the foot of Carmela's previous letter: \"The 5 December, at past 1 hour and 3 minutes after midnight, my daughter Carmela de la Concepción died. This is the letter destined to announce it to me. The sadness it reveals should have made me see, but hope is so sweet.\"\n\nWhen the war broke out, Prat was assigned to assistant of the Navy General Command, a position he tried to reject.\n\nWhen Don Rafael Sotomayor Baeza was required to go to Antofagasta with instructions from the Government, he requested an assistant, and Prat was assigned to the job. Being both of them aboard the armored \"Blanco Encalada\", he was assigned to notify Iquique's authorities that they have been blocked by the Chilean army, which he did without letting the hostile position of the people daunt him.\n\nHe was assigned \"Covadonga\"s command. On 3 May the corvette \"Abtao\", under lieutenant commander Carlos Condell de la Haza's command, and \"Covadonga\", under Prat's command, set sail towards Iquique arriving on 10 May.\n\nTo achieve the plan that Admiral Juan Williams Rebolledo had conceived, consisting of attacking the Peruvian squadron in Callao's port, he assigned as \"Abtao\"s commander Manuel Thompson, who commanded the corvette until then. Arturo Prat replaced him, and Carlos Condell de la Haza was designated \"Covadonga\"s commander.\n\nOn 16 May, the squadron set sail to Callao, with the intention of surprising the Peruvian warships, but the same day Peruvian monitor and armored frigate \"Independencia\" set sail from that port, towards Arica, to carry reinforcements, armaments, ammunition and provisions, so both squadrons missed each other on their trips.\n\nIt was 21 May 1879, 6:30 in the morning, when the fog cleared, \"Covadonga\"s lookout shouted: \"Smoke to the north!\". But, owing to thick marine fog, they were not able to identify the newly arrived ships, but after a few moments they thought it was the Peruvian squadron coming back.\n\nAt 6:45 a.m., a sailor by Condell's side asked for the telescope, and in a moment of clarity he observed the warships' rigging and said to Condell: \"It's the \"Huáscar \"and the \"Independencia\"\". \"What basis do you have to assert that?\" asked Condell, and the sailor answered \"From the shape of the platform on top of the foremast\".\n\nImmediately Condell ordered a shot to be fired in the air to warn \"Esmeralda\", still anchored in the port. The ships were indeed \"Independencia\" and \"Huáscar\".\n\nIn that same moment, the Peruvian admiral Miguel Grau Seminario addressed his crew:\n\"Crewmembers and Sailors of the Huáscar, Iquique is at sight, there are our afflicted fellow countrymen from Tarapacá, and also the enemy, still unpunished. It's time to punish them! I hope you will know how. Remember how our forces distinguished in Junin, the 2nd of May, Abtao, Ayachucho and other battlefields, to win us our glorious and dignified independence, and our consecrated and brilliant laurels of freedom. No matter the outcome, Peru will not fall. For our fatherland, \"Long Live Peru!\"\"\n\nCarlos Condell de la Haza warned Prat, and he, seeing the difference between their forces and the enemy's, pronounced his famous impassioned speech in front of his brothers in arms:\n\nLads, the battle will be unfair, but, cheer and have courage. Never has our flag been hauled down before the enemy and I hope this will not be the occasion for it to happen. From my part, I assure you that as long as I live, this flag will remain flying in its place, and if I should die, my officers will know how to fulfill their duties. \"Long Live Chile!\"\n\n\"Esmeralda\" was an old wooden corvette weighing 850 tons and 200 horsepower, with eight 40-pound cannons, four 30-pounders and two of 6 pounds. When the action began, Prat ordered Condell to follow his course and \"Covadonga\" met with \"Esmeralda\" and \"La Mar\" in the middle of the bay. With the bugler sounding Action Stations, the crew took their places.\n\nAt 8:15, the first volley hit between the ships, and Prat ordered \"Esmeralda\" to start moving, followed by \"Covadonga\". At 8:25 a second volley fell and a shot from \"Huáscar\" hit fully on the starboard (right) side, passed through \"Esmeralda\"s side, killing the surgeon Videla, beheading his assistant, and mortally wounding another sailor.\n\nThe transporter \"Lamar\" hoisted the US flag and fled to the south, and Condell changed his course and went behind that ship. Grau ordered \"Independencia\" to block \"Covadonga\" and \"Lamar\"s way. Prat observed Condell's action and asked himself: \"What is Condell doing?\" Condell ignored Prat's order and followed \"Lamar\", but the warship did get away from \"Covadonga\", and \"Independencia\" under control of Juan Guillermo Moore followed him. On the other hand, the monitor \"Huáscar\" weighed 1,130 tons and had armour plating 4½-inches thick, with two 300-pound cannon in a revolving turret and 11 knots maximum speed.\nGrau directed \"Independencia\" to chase \"Covadonga\", while he finished \"Esmeralda\". Prat quickly positioned the ship in front of the coast, 200 meters from it, forcing \"Huáscar\" to shoot with a parabolic trajectory to avoid hitting the Peruvian village, whose people gathered in crowds to watch the battle.\n\nGeneral Buendía, commander of the Peruvian garrison of Iquique, had artillery cannons placed on the beach and sent an emissary in a fast rowing boat with a warning to \"Huáscar\" that \"Esmeralda\" was loaded with torpedoes. Grau stopped from her and began shooting with the 300-pound cannons, not hitting her for an hour and a half, owing to the Peruvian sailors' inexperience in the handling of the monitor's Coles turret. The Chilean crew answered with their 30-pound cannons and gunfire, shots that rebounded uselessly from \"Huáscar\"s plated armour.\n\nAt the coast, the Peruvian Army garrison in the town began to bombard the Chilean ship. A grenade reached her, killing three men. Prat ordered the warship to move, slowly maneuvering at scarcely 4 knots, for her engine was defective and one the boilers had burst. He stopped 1,000 m from the city and 250 m from land, where they would stand until their sinking. This move allowed Grau to see the absence of the torpedoes that supposedly filled \"Esmeralda\". One of \"Huáscar\"s shots hit directly on board, beheading the ordering bugler and mutilating the gun crews. The position of \"Esmeralda\" was desperate.\n\nAt 11:30am, Admiral Grau, seeing the useless slaughter and wanting to end the combat, which had been nearly four hours long, ordered his ship to ram into \"Esmeralda\". The monitor backed to get enough impulse and charged bow-first into starboard side of the ship. When Prat saw the enemy warship colliding into his, near the stern, he raised his sword and cried his final order: \"Let's board, boys!\", but due to the roar of the battle, only the Marine Artilleryman and Prat's personal escort in battle, Petty Officer Juan de Dios Aldea and Seaman Arsenio Canave heard it, and both of them and Prat jumped aboard \"Huáscar\". Arsenio unfortunately slipped and fell down because of the impact, so only the two officers got to the monitor. Aldea received a burst from the artillery tower and fell mortally injured. Only Prat continued advancing, amazing the Peruvian crew with his tremendous courage. Grau gave the order to capture him alive.\n\nPrat got to the enemy's deck and advanced towards the command tower, but he was hit by a bullet, bringing him down to his knees. Another shot from a sharpshooter perched on the artillery tower struck him dead.\nThe crew of \"Esmeralda\" saw with horror their captain's sacrifice, and when \"Huáscar\" tried another charge, now against \"Esmeralda\"s bow, Sublieutenant Ignacio Serrano boarded \"Huáscar\" with ten more men, armed with machetes and rifles but they were massacred by shots from the mounted Gatling guns and the monitor's crew. Serrano was then the only survivor, having received several wounds in the groin. Grau quickly had him picked up and carried to the infirmary in a state of shock, where they left him next to the dying petty officer Aldea.\n\nA third ram, this time into the middle of \"Esmeralda\", was fatal and sentenced the ship to death. Nobody else could jump to the other ship, as \"Esmeralda\" was already sinking. The last cannon shot was fired by Midshipman Ernesto Riquelme, while the main deck was going underwater. Grau and the \"Huáscar\" crew by then also heard shouts of \"\"Long Live Chile! Glory and Victory!\"\" from the ship's sailors. It was 12:10 pm at midday. Grau expressed grief for Prat's death and paid his respects at his own cabin.\n\nAfter the battle, Grau gave orders that Prat's body and those of his men were to be taken ashore for burial in Iquique and that Prat's personal possessions (diary, uniform and sword among others) were to be returned to his widow. Carmela Carvajal received the items, together with an attached letter from the Peruvian admiral, affirming his rival's personal qualities, his gentility and his high moral values. The bodies of Prat and his crew were initially laid to rest in Iquique but in 1888 their remains were transferred to a crypt under the imposing new Heroes of Iquique monument in Valparaiso's Plaza Sotomayor.\n\nIn the confrontation of Iquique, Chile lost that day an old wooden ship, but Prat's death allowed the mobilization of the Chilean population to support the war, and that would be one of the factors of the Chilean victory in the War of the Pacific, the most important being the superiority of the Chilean fleet in the Pacific.\n\n\n\nMuch of the content of this article comes from (retrieved January, 2006).

{"id": "1918270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918270", "title": "Metal Gear Acid 2", "text": "Metal Gear Acid 2\n\n, stylized as METAL GEAR AC!D², is a turn-based collectible card stealth game developed by Kojima Productions and published by Konami for the PlayStation Portable in 2005. A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled \"Metal Gear Acid 2 Mobile\".\n\n\"Acid 2\" is the sequel to the original \"Metal Gear Acid\", with the story set sometime after the events of the previous game. Like its predecessor, it follows an alternate continuity separate from the mainline \"Metal Gear\" series. The game uses a completely new cel-shaded graphic engine, replacing the darker graphics from the first game, and features an improved gameplay system. It comes with a PSP add-on called the Solid Eye, which is a folding cardboard box with specialized lenses that fit over the PSP's screen, creating a stereoscopic image.\n\nGameplay remains of \"Metal Gear Acid 2\" essentially similar to that of its predecessor: using a series of collectible trading cards based on the other \"Metal Gear\" games. There are new features, such as the SELL option for cards, allowing overstocked cards that the player cannot use to be sold for more points (in-game currency used to buy cards) and cover fire (when a player's ally is behind an enemy and has an equipped weapon in range of the target, when the player attacks, his/her ally takes a shot onto the target as well). Also added are the ability to move past doors instead of stopping when approaching, and characters can now pick up items such as weapons and card packs by simply running over them (instead of having to end movement on top of the item). \n\nThe game uses a revamped engine, featuring a cel-shaded presentation, 3D equipment boxes, and new particle effects. There is a tutorial mode for beginners and a new \"Arena\" single-player mode that allows players to battle boss characters from previous games such as Liquid Snake and Vamp using the \"Acid 2\" card-battling system. There are also extra missions such as \"Sneaking\" and \"Elimination\" modes. The game can be also played in the \"Wireless Battle\" mode (using \"ad hoc\" connection only). An additional \"Solid Eye Theater\" mode is to watch videos of the Japanese women seen on posters and magazines throughout the \"Metal Gear\" series, utilizing the Solid Eye attachment.\n\nThe gameplay system consists primarily of the usage of cards (obtainable in-game, through a card shop, or other means such as codes or game completion). These cards have a variety of effects for the player, and most can double as a movement card (represented in the form of blocks, referenced as BLKS in-game). Activation conditions include USE (where they can be used immediately if all conditions are met), EQUIP (where cards take up an equipment slot), or MOVE (allowing the player to move). Most cards can move the player 3 BLKS, but some cards allow more (or less), and a number of cards are dedicated movement cards, most of which are based on soldiers from the previous \"Metal Gear\" games. COST is also an important factor, as it affects turn order and is represented in the form of a small counter. It can be summarized as the time taken for the player to perform an action, so if the player has a cost of 0 and an enemy has the cost of 1, the player will go first, regardless of the number of turns he/she has had (unless a condition or card effect states otherwise). If the player (or enemy) builds his/her cost up to the amount that another character already has, that puts him behind the character with the equal cost in the turn order. COST build up varies by card and is indicated in the upper-right corner of the card.\n\nThere are 565 cards, more than twice the number of the original game, including upgradeable cards. Cards vary drastically: some allow the player to attack (Weapon Cards), some provide support such as the ability to dodge an attack (Support Cards), giving the player the ability to perform an action such as the \"hold-up\" move that incapacitates enemies when the player threatens them from behind or to choke an enemy unconscious (Action Cards), to use items like rations or body armor (Item Cards), or special character cards with varying effects based on the characters they represent (either all from Metal Gear games or other Konami games) such as the Sniper Wolf card with gives the player 40% more accuracy on equipped weapon for one use (Character Cards). Some cards reduce cost or give an extra turns or action points (each card takes up one action point).\n\n\"Acid 2\" ships with a viewing device called the Solid Eye. It is a folding cardboard box that slides over the PSP, separating the image with a divider in the center. The game is playable with or without the Solid Eye. When switched into Solid Eye mode, the game displays two images on either side of the PSP screen. When used with the Solid Eye, the images overlap and produce a pop-out, 3D effect. The game and manual warn that using this device for extended periods of time may lead to eyestrain, and prolonged use is not recommended. As more cards are collected, videos are unlocked in the Solid Eye Theater, available from the game's menu. These videos are only viewable as Solid Eye footage, and showcase videos of Japanese women as well as cut scenes from \"\".\n\n\"Acid 2\" is capable of communicating with \"\" for the PlayStation 2. By connecting a PS2 to a PSP, it is possible to take photos in \"Subsistence\" and transfer them to a PSP for viewing in 3D with the Solid Eye. The manual that is included with the American version of the game is significantly thinned down, and as such, does not contain a specific guide on how to utilize this feature. Instructions can be found in the downloadable manual. \n\nThe story begins with a man known as Snake, a young woman named Consuela Alvarez, and two pilots named Dave Copeland and Roddy Louiz, flying into the United States illegally when they are arrested by the FBI. After being caught, Snake is pressed into a mission by his captor, an FBI agent named Dalton. Snake agrees to the job to free his friends and clear his name with Dalton. Snake's initial objective is to infiltrate a research facility operated by SaintLogic (called \"StrateLogic\" in the Japanese version), a military arms manufacturer, located on an isolated North American island. Dalton is investigating SaintLogic for inhuman actions towards children, and utilizes Snake's abilities to infiltrate SaintLogic and uncover the truth behind their business practices.\n\nShortly into Snake's mission, Dalton's authority is exceeded by General Wiseman, an official with the United States Department of Defense. Snake slowly learns that Wiseman's involvement is in response to a SaintLogic executive Thomas Koppelthorn, who has made demands that the United States release several prisoners and has threatened to use nuclear weapons. Wiseman proceeds to offer Snake information regarding his past in return for Snake's assistance in eliminating the present SaintLogic threat. Snake teams with Venus, Wiseman's own operative, and together they search SaintLogic for Koppelthorn. Soon after, a test is initiated, and Snake becomes aware that SaintLogic has developed a Metal Gear which Koppelthorn has taken control of. It later becomes evident that Koppelthorn is seeking revenge for an incident that occurred three years before, and among his demands are that the United States release Snake to him. General Wiseman constantly comments on a Lucinda File, which he wants Venus to obtain. As Snake and Venus search SaintLogic's research facilities, they encounter a researcher, Dr. Takiyama, and a young girl, Lucy, who proceed to join Koppelthorn's scheme. Before crossing to the building where Koppelthorn is located, Snake and Venus are met by Metal Gear Kodoque from the first Acid which was rescued before being destroyed during the events of the last game.\n\nUpon finally meeting with Koppelthorn, Metal Gear Chaioth Ha Qadesh, Lucy, and Dr. Takiyama, Snake and Venus learn that Koppelthorn has been 'resurrecting' his wife in the form of a young girl, Lucy. Before the final fight against Koppelthorn, it is revealed that Snake is actually a Model 3 Test Subject who was created in SaintLogic labs by Koppelthorn's wife. Snake then learns that he is a clone of Solid Snake, who SaintLogic recovered after the Lobito Incident. Snake was sent to Serena to quell an uprising of Model 2 subjects, better known as the Praulia Massacre. The Lucinda File is unmasked to be a log of the events of the incident in Serena. After Snake and Venus defeat Koppelthorn, Lucy reveals herself to not actually be a rebirth of Lucinda Koppelthorn, but rather her own being with the consciousness of Lucinda. Lucy then declares the truth about Lucinda, who had helped Snake to escape SaintLogic and wanted to die because of her inhumane actions. Lucy kills Tom Koppelthorn and takes control of Metal Gear Chaioth Ha Qadesh acting on her true nature of being test subject designed to kill. Snake and Venus must once again defeat Chaioth Ha Qadesh and Lucy as well.\n\nSnake and Venus next learn that the SaintLogic facility is wired with explosives, and learn the location of Dr. Takiyama as well as the Lucinda File. After recovering both, Venus pulls a gun on Snake at Wiseman's command. Wiseman announces that he was responsible for the Praulia Massacre because he wanted to hurry along the project with a field test. An ethnic uprising that was occurring in Serena at the time was an opportune time to test the SaintLogic subjects. This initial test did not provide sufficient information concerning the limits of the test subjects, and Wiseman ordered for the subjects to be pushed to their limits. After the massacre, Wiseman arranged for Snake to flee to the United States. Dalton was informed of Snake's entering the country and, as desired by Wiseman, apprehended Snake. Wiseman's original plan was for Dalton and Snake to attempt to infiltrate SaintLogic but become tangled in the facilities guards. At this time Wiseman was to have Venus work her way through SaintLogic and recover the Lucinda File, and place any blame on Dalton and Snake. Venus is then revealed to be a test subject, newer than Snake, who was placed in the care of Wiseman after the activities in Serena. Snake learns that Venus was the cause of his amnesia, as she had shot him during the Praulia Massacre. Snake and Venus duel and, following Venus's defeat, work their way out of the SaintLogic buildings with Dr. Takiyama. Venus and Dr. Takiyama escape however Snake is trapped inside. Venus and Takiyama escape the building safely, and outside SaintLogic witness Metal Gear Chaioth Ha Qadesh return to life. The U.S. military, which has been called in to secure SaintLogic, fires upon Metal Gear and a missile from its rear launches, and lands in the ocean a short distance away. It is revealed in a cutscene that Snake was in the launcher instead of a missile and utilized it to escape, breaking most bones in his body.\nThe game ends with Dr. Takiyama and Venus safely recovering from the SaintLogic incident, with General Wiseman arrested and facing charges of war crimes. Snake, who has recovered extremely quickly, is confronted by Dalton, who provides him with a United States identity, his friends, and $15 million. \n\nIn the North American and European versions, several illustrations that accompany the end credits show what happens to the game's main characters after the incident. Wiseman is shown being led away by law enforcement personnel, but his manner remains undaunted, implying perhaps that there is yet a way for him out of his predicament. Dalton gets dressed down by a superior at the FBI, although he retains a smug demeanor not unlike Wiseman's. Dr. Takiyama is merely shown looking pensive in the helicopter that carries her off the island. And in a vignette that could have been taken much later after the events of the SaintLogic incident, Venus is seen manning the checkout counter at a supermarket, hinting at her quiet assimilation into everyday life.\n\n\nThe Western versions include ten new cards not included in the Japanese release, six of which are based on \"\": namely Solid Snake, Otacon, Metal Gear Mk. II, GEKKO, Solid Eye, and No Smoking. The remaining four were fan made submissions selected in a Konami sponsored contest by four online publications (\"Game Informer\", IGN, GameSpy, and 1UP.com), which were an alternate Naked Snake card from \"MGS3\", a Banana Skin, Possessed Arm, and Emma's Parrot.\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Akihiro Honda, Hiroshi Tanabe, Nobuko Toda and Shuichi Kobori. It was released along with the \"Metal Gear Acid\" soundtrack on December 21, 2005, in the two-disc compilation \"Metal Gear Acid 1 and 2 Original Soundtrack\".\n\n\"Metal Gear Acid 2\" received generally positive reviews from critics and the public. It currently holds a MetaCritic score of 80, with a separate User Rating of 8.2.\n\n"}

{"id": "1918285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918285", "title": "Sunshine Biscuits", "text": "Sunshine Biscuits\n\nSunshine Biscuits was an independent American baker of cookies, crackers, and cereals. The company, whose brand still appears today on a few products (e.g., Cheez-Its), was purchased by Keebler Company in 1996, which was subsequently purchased by Kellogg Company in 2000. Around that time, Sunshine Biscuits was headquartered in Elmhurst, Illinois, the same town in which Keebler was located until 2001.\n\nAt the time of its purchase by Keebler, Sunshine Biscuits was the third largest cookie baker in the United States.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, the biscuit/cracker industry was made up of small independent local bakeries preparing products and selling them in bulk. The barrels and crates of biscuits were delivered by horse and wagon, set out in the grocery store and sold to the consumer by the measure.\n\nIn 1890, a group of thirty-three Midwest and western bakers combined to form the American Biscuit & Manufacturing Company. This consolidation was done primarily to compete with United States Baking Company, another Midwest group and the New York Biscuit Company, an east coast conglomerate. Soon the American Biscuit and New York Biscuit groups were opening bakeries and lowering prices in each other's area in an attempt to eliminate the competition. Finally in February 1898 the competing groups combined 114 factories and formed the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco).\n\nAlthough Joseph Loose was a member of Nabisco's Board of Directors, in 1902 along with his brother Jacob and John H. Wiles, he liquidated his holdings in National Biscuit Company and formed the Loose-Wiles Biscuit Company in Kansas City. They envisioned a factory which would be filled with sunlight and so they adopted the name SUNSHINE for their products. Soon they began expanding and opened new plants in Boston and then New York. In 1912 Loose-Wiles opened their \"Thousand Window\" bakery in the Long Island City neighborhood of New York City, which remained the largest bakery building in the world until 1955. The plant was closed in 1965 and the production was moved to Sayreville, New Jersey.\n\nLoose-Wiles never registered their \"Sunshine\" brand name and therefore spent much effort in the first forty years trying to dissuade other companies from using the word \"sunshine\" or any related word on their product or in their advertising. Since Loose-Wiles claim was not based on a registered mark, they often had to investigate when and where the other company first used the word to determine which company had first claim so as not to lose their right to the name \"Sunshine\" for their own products. Finally in 1946, the Loose-Wiles Company officially changed its name to Sunshine Biscuit, Inc.\n\nThe early part of the company's history was dominated by developing new items and acquiring established brands from other smaller companies. Many of the products and their names are similar to those of their largest competitor, the National Biscuit Company. For example, Nabisco's first individually packaged cracker was named \"Uneeda\". Loose-Wile's cracker was \"Takhoma\". Loose-Wiles made \"Trumps Cookies\". Nabisco produced \"Aces\". Sunshine Biscuit had \"Animal Crackers\" and \"Toy Cookies\". Nabisco produced \"Barnum's Animals\".\n\nThe American Tobacco Company purchased the company in 1966. It was then sold to G. F. Industries, a privately held California company, and finally merged with the Keebler Company in 1996.\n\nSunshine Biscuits made the Hydrox chocolate sandwich cream cookie, before it was discontinued in 1999. They were reintroduced in 2015, and are now made by Leaf Brands. Today, Sunshine is best known for the Cheez-It snack crackers, which are still marketed under the Sunshine brand, as are Krispy Crackers saltines. However, six well-known Sunshine brands were discontinued after the merger with Keebler: Chip-A-Roos, Chocolate Nugget cookies, Chocolate Fudge Cookies, Lemon Coolers, Golden Raisin Biscuits (Garibaldi biscuits) and Golden Fruit Biscuits. Sunshine originated Vienna Fingers cookies, which are now sold under the Keebler brand.\n\n\n\nThey also made a snack cracker line called American Heritage, Cherry Coolers, Fig Bars (not to be confused with Fig Newtons) and International Snacks, a line of sandwich cookies with two flavors of creme in every cookie. Shredded Wheat was produced at the Sayreville, New Jersey facility and distributed only east of the Mississippi.\n"}
{"id": "1918286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918286", "title": "Paradox of thrift", "text": "Paradox of thrift\n\nThe paradox of thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an increase in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower \"total\" saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that which is true of the parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be good for the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.\n\nIt had been stated as early as 1714 in \"The Fable of the Bees\", and similar sentiments date to antiquity. It was popularized by John Maynard Keynes and is a central component of Keynesian economics. It has formed part of mainstream economics since the late 1940s.\n\nThe argument begins from the observation that in equilibrium, total income must equal total output. Assuming that income has a direct effect on saving, an increase in the autonomous component of saving, other things being equal, will move the equilibrium point at which income equals output to a lower value, thereby inducing a decline in saving that may more than offset the original increase.\n\nIn this form it represents a prisoner's dilemma as saving is beneficial to each individual but deleterious to the general population. This is a \"paradox\" because it runs contrary to intuition. Someone unaware of the paradox of thrift would fall into a fallacy of composition and assume that what seems to be good for an individual within the economy will be good for the entire population. However, exercising thrift may be good for an individual by enabling that individual to save for a \"rainy day\", and yet not be good for the economy as a whole.\n\nThis paradox can be explained by analyzing the place, and impact, of increased savings in an economy. If a population decides to save more money at all income levels, then total revenues for companies will decline. This decreased demand causes a contraction of output, giving employers and employees lower income. Eventually the population's total saving will have remained the same or even declined because of lower incomes and a weaker economy. This paradox is based on the proposition, put forth in Keynesian economics, that many economic downturns are demand-based.\n\nWhile the paradox of thrift was popularized by Keynes, and is often attributed to him, it was stated by a number of others prior to Keynes, and the proposition that spending may help and saving may hurt an economy dates to antiquity; similar sentiments occur in the Bible verse:\n\nwhich has found occasional use as an epigram in underconsumptionist writings.\n\nKeynes himself notes the appearance of the paradox in \"The Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits\" (1714) by Bernard Mandeville, the title itself hinting at the paradox, and Keynes citing the passage:\n\nKeynes suggests Adam Smith was referring to this passage when he wrote \"What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great Kingdom.\"\n\nThe problem of underconsumption and oversaving, as they saw it, was developed by underconsumptionist economists of the 19th century, and the paradox of thrift in the strict sense that \"collective attempts to save yield lower overall savings\" was explicitly stated by John M. Robertson in\nhis 1892 book \"The Fallacy of Saving,\" writing:\nSimilar ideas were forwarded by William Trufant Foster and Waddill Catchings in the 1920s in \"The Dilemma of Thrift\".\n\nKeynes distinguished between business activity/investment (\"Enterprise\") and savings (\"Thrift\") in his \"Treatise on Money\" (1930):\n\nHe stated the paradox of thrift in \"The General Theory\", 1936:\nThe theory is referred to as the \"paradox of thrift\" in Samuelson's influential \"Economics\" of 1948, which popularized the term.\n\nThe paradox of thrift formally can be well described as a circuit paradox using the terms of \"Balances Mechanics\" developed by the German economist Wolfgang Stützel (German: \"Saldenmechanik\"): It is about saving by cut of expenses, which always leads to a revenue surplus of the individual, so to saving of money. But once the totality (in the meaning of every each) saves at expenses, the revenues of economy only decline.\n\n\nThe paradox of thrift has been related to the debt deflation theory of economic crises, being called \"the paradox of debt\" – people save not to increase savings, but rather to pay down debt. As well, a paradox of toil and a paradox of flexibility have been proposed: A willingness to work more in a liquidity trap and wage flexibility after a debt deflation shock may lead not only to lower wages, but lower employment.\n\nDuring April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen discussed the \"Paradox of deleveraging\" described by economist Hyman Minsky: \"Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\"\n\nWithin mainstream economics, non-Keynesian economists, particularly neoclassical economists, criticize this theory on three principal grounds.\n\nThe first criticism is that, following Say's law and the related circle of ideas, if demand slackens, prices will fall (barring government intervention), and the resulting lower price will stimulate demand (though at lower profit or cost – possibly even lower wages). This criticism in turn has been questioned by New Keynesian economists, who reject Say's law and instead point to evidence of sticky prices as a reason why prices do not fall in recession; this remains a debated point.\n\nThe second criticism is that savings represent loanable funds, particularly at banks, assuming the savings are held at banks, rather than currency itself being held (\"stashed under one's mattress\"). Thus an accumulation of savings yields an increase in potential lending, which will lower interest rates and stimulate borrowing. So a decline in consumer spending is offset by an increase in lending, and subsequent investment and spending.\n\nTwo caveats are added to this criticism. Firstly, if savings are held as cash, rather than being loaned out (directly by savers, or indirectly, as via bank deposits), then loanable funds do not increase, and thus a recession may be caused – but this is due to holding cash, not to saving per se. Secondly, banks themselves may hold cash, rather than loaning it out, which results in the growth of excess reserves – funds on deposit but not loaned out. This is argued to occur in liquidity trap situations, when interest rates are at a zero lower bound (or near it) and savings still exceed investment demand. Within Keynesian economics, the desire to hold currency rather than loan it out is discussed under liquidity preference.\n\nThird, the paradox assumes a closed economy in which savings are not invested abroad (to fund exports of local production abroad). Thus, while the paradox may hold at the global level, it need not hold at the local or national level: if one nation increases savings, this can be offset by trading partners consuming a greater amount relative to their own production, i.e., if the saving nation increases exports, and its partners increase imports. This criticism is not very controversial, and is generally accepted by Keynesian economists as well, who refer to it as \"exporting one's way out of a recession\". They further note that this frequently occurs in concert with currency devaluation (hence increasing exports and decreasing imports), and cannot work as a solution to a global problem, because the global economy is a closed system – not \"every\" nation can increase net exports.\n\nThe Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek criticized the paradox in a 1929 article, \"The 'Paradox' of Savings\", questioning the paradox as proposed by Foster and Catchings. Hayek, and later Austrian School economists agree that if a population saves more money, total revenues for companies will decline, but they deny the assertion that lower revenues lead to lower economic growth, understanding that the additional savings are used to create more capital to increase production. Once the new, more productive structure of capital has reorganized inside of the current structure, the real costs of production is reduced for most firms. Some criticisms argue that using accumulated capital to increase production is an act which requires spending, and therefore the Austrian argument does not disprove the paradox.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A scenario describes one way that a system is or is envisaged to be used in the context of activity in a defined time-frame. The time-frame for a scenario could be (for example) a single transaction; a business operation; a day or other period; or the whole operational life of a system. Similarly the scope of a scenario could be (for example) a single system or piece of equipment; an equipped team or department; or an entire organization.\n\nScenarios are frequently used as part of the system development process. They are typically produced by usability or marketing specialists, often working in concert with end users and developers. Scenarios are written in plain language, with minimal technical details, so that stakeholders (designers, usability specialists, programmers, engineers, managers, marketing specialists, etc.) can have a common example which can focus their discussions.\n\nIncreasingly, scenarios are used directly to define the wanted behaviour of software: replacing or supplementing traditional functional requirements. Scenarios are often defined in use cases, which document alternative and overlapping ways of reaching a goal.\n\nMany types of scenario are in use in system development. Alexander and Maiden list the following types:\n\nNegative scenarios or misuse cases may be written to indicate likely threats which should be countered to ensure that systems have sufficient security, safety, and reliability.

The Type 052C introduced both fixed active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and vertically launched surface-to-air missiles into PLAN service, making it the first PLAN warship with area air defence capability.\n\nThe first two ships, and , were laid down at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai in 2002, and entered service in 2004 and 2005 respectively. No new ships were laid down until 2010; the pause may have been due to the relocation of the shipyard.\n\nThe Type 052C appears to share the same basic hull design as the Type 052B destroyer, which in turn is based on the Type 051B destroyer. Stealth features are incorporated.\n\nThe Type 052C uses predominantly Chinese systems derived from earlier foreign technology; the preceding Type 052 and Type 052B destroyers used a mixture of Russian and Chinese systems.\n\nThe Type 052C carries 48 HHQ-9 naval surface-to-air missiles (SAM), each with a range of . The SAMs are cold launched from eight revolver-type vertical launchers, with six missiles per launcher.\n\nEight YJ-62 anti-ship missiles are carried in two quad-canister launchers just forward of the hangar. Each missile has a range of .\n\nThe main gun is a PJ-87. The gun suffered from jamming and may have influenced the decision to adopt a different weapon for the Type 052D destroyer. The weapon has a rate of fire of 25 rounds per minute.\n\nClose-in defence is provided by two seven-barrel Type 730 CIWS, one mounted forward of the bridge and one atop the hangar. Each gun has a maximum rate of fire of 4200 rounds per minute.\n\nTwo triple torpedo tubes are carried; these are copies or derivatives of the B515/ILAS-3. This launcher may fire the Yu-7 ASW torpedo.\n\nThe Type 052C is the first PLAN warship to mount the G-band Type 346 AESA radar. The four phased array antennas are mounted on the taller forward superstructure. The Type 346 is used for air search, and provides fire control for the HHQ-9. The combination of AESA radar and VLS SAMs produces a marked increase in anti-aircraft firepower over previous PLAN warships.\n\nA Kamov Ka-28 or Harbin Z-9 helicopter may operate from the rear hangar and flight deck. The Ka-28 is equipped with a search radar and dipping sonar and can also employ sonobuoys, torpedoes, depth charges, or mines. The Z-9 is a variant of the Airbus Helicopters AS365 Dauphin. The naval variant of the Z-9, the Z-9C, is equipped with the KLC-1 search radar, dipping sonar, and is typically armed with a single, lightweight torpedo. Either helicopter significantly improves the anti-submarine capabilities of the Type 052C.\n\nThe Type 052C propulsion is in the combined diesel or gas (CODOG) arrangement, with two Ukrainian DA80 gas turbines and two MTU 20V 956TB92 diesel engines.\n\nThe DA80s had blade problems and may have contributed to the last two Type 052Cs sitting pierside at the shipyard for two years without being accepted by the PLAN.\n\nThe MTU 20V 956TB92 engines were license-produced by Shaanxi Diesel Engine Works.\n\n\n"}

Doing as told, they took their infant son and fled by night into Egypt, where they stayed until Herod had died. The three Magi were separately warned in a dream of the threat that King Herod posed and went home by a different route than they came.\n\nHerod had planned to make the Magi tell him of the whereabouts of the Christ child. When he hears of the Magi's change in course, he grew angry and tried to kill the infant messiah by killing all the young children in the area, an event known as the Massacre of the Innocents.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:16\n\nBrown notes that the \"then, when\" construction is used throughout Matthew to indicate a change of scene as in this case where the narrative moves from the Holy Family to King Herod.\n\nThe word \"empaizein\" is variously translated as deceived or mocked; in reality, Brown notes that the word is a combination of the two ideas and has no direct English translation.\n\nClarke notes that the description of Herod as \"exceeding wroth\" has been central to Herod's perception and was the foundation for how the king was portrayed in the mystery cycles of the past and in modern popular culture.\n\nJones notes that \"surroundings\" refers to the rural areas around the village of Bethlehem. It does not refer to any other nearby towns or villages. At the time, Bethlehem was a small village and it and its surrounding area would have had a very small population. Albright and Mann estimate the village would have had only some 300 people at the time, Raymond E. Brown estimates it was around a thousand. For all these figures, the number of children killed would have been less than twenty. This number clashes with the traditional view of thousands of deaths, but it helps explain why the massacre was not mentioned by any historians such as Josephus. The killing of all the infants in a small village would have been only one of many massacres Herod is recorded to have carried out in his later years. At the same time, Brown notes that the double word \"all\" shows that the author of Matthew is trying to portray a large massacre.\n\nGundry notes that \"two years old and under\" properly refers to children who have not entered their second year, thus those twelve months old and younger. That Herod picks this number is considered an important clue to when Jesus was born. It is taken to indicate that close to a year had elapsed since the birth of Jesus. Herod is believed to have died in 4 BC so based on Matthew, Jesus' birth is guessed to have been in 5 or 6 BC.\n"}

{"id": "1918320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918320", "title": "Herbert von Dirksen", "text": "Herbert von Dirksen\n\nEduard Willy Kurt Herbert von Dirksen (2 April 1882 – 19 December 1955) was a German diplomat who is best remembered as the last German Ambassador to Britain before World War II.\n\nDirksen was born into a recently ennobled family. The Dirksen family had been Prussian civil servants for generations, and his father, Willibald, was ennobled by Emperor Wilhelm I in 1887 and was granted a large estate together with Gröditzberg (modern Grodziec Castle) in Silesia as a reward for his services to the House of Hohenzollern. Willibald von Dirksen was a conservative nationalist who after retiring held a seat in the \"Reichstag\" for the anti-Semitic \"Reichspartei\", and was described as a \"fanatical admirer\" of Wilhelm II, whom he visited regularly when he was in his Dutch exile while his mother Viktoria came from a wealthy banking family. His mother was once helpful to Adolf Hitler, which benefited Dirksen's career in Nazi Germany. In his memoirs, Dirksen boasted that he was \"proud of my purely Germanic blood\" as the Dirksen family had been ennobled in 1887 \"before a whole batch of more or less Jew-tainted families were ennobled by the liberalistic Emperor Frederick III\" in 1888.\n\nAs the Dirksens were parvenu nobility unlike the ancient \"Junker\" families, they felt very insecure, and from the age of 5 onward, Herbert was forced to undergo a strict training regime to produce an \"exemplary bearing\" to allow him to be accepted by the \"Junkers\". Dirsken had wanted to enter the exclusive \"Auswärtiges Amt\" (Foreign Office), but his father forced him to enter the Prussian civil service in order to prepare him to manage the family's estate in Silesia. As a university student at Heidelberg, the snobbish Dirksen joined the most exclusive fraternity whose membership were mostly aristocrats, a fact which was a source of considerable pride to him. In 1905, he graduated with a \"Referendar\" (junior barrister) legal degree and, in 1907, he went on a tour around the world. After his graduation from university, Dirksen become a reserve officer with the Third Guard Ulan regiment based in Potsdam, which he always noted only accepted men from the aristocracy as officers. After working as an assistant judge, in 1910, Dirksen went on a four-month trip to Rhodesia, South Africa and German East Africa, where he was thinking about settling. During World War I, Dirksen served in the German Army as a lieutenant and won the Iron Cross, Second Class. The American historian Carl Schorske described Dirksen as a \"correct and proper aristocrat with the right connections\", but also a man who was slavishly loyal to those who held power. Entering the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" in 1917, Dirksen served in the Hague (1917), Kiev (1918–1919) and in Warsaw (1920–1921).\n\nIn April 1920, Dirksen arrived in Warsaw to take up the post of chargé d'affaires. As the chargé d'affaires of the German embassy in Warsaw, Dirksen's relations with the Poles were extremely difficult. As Germany had no ambassador stationed at its embassy in Warsaw, Dirksen as the chargé d'affaires was in effect the ambassador to Poland; a measure of his antipathy to Poles can be seen in that the chapter of his 1950 memoirs dealing with his time in Warsaw, virtually all of Dirksen's comments about Poland and Poles are negative. In his memoirs, Dirksen wrote that he \"shared the deep-seated feeling of superiority over the Pole inherent in the German\". In May 1921, a plebiscite to decide the status of Silesia led to fighting between the Germans and Poles in Upper Silesia, who were supported by their respective national governments, causing strained relations between Berlin and Warsaw. As someone who had grown in Silesia, Dirksen's sympathies were completely with the German side, which led him to insist that all of Silesia belonged to Germany and none of the parts of Silesia that voted to join Poland would be allowed to leave the \"Reich\". In October 1921, Dirksen left Warsaw to head up the Polish desk at the \"Auswärtiges Amt\".\n\nFrom May 1923 to February 1925, Dirksen served as German Consul in the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk, Poland). Under Point 14 of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, it had been announced that Poland should have its independence restored with secure access to the Baltic Sea. Taking up Point 14, the Poles had pressed at the Paris Peace Conference to annex Danzig, a city that was mostly German, but instead, the Allies compromised by creating the Free City of Danzig, an independent city-state that was under the protection of the League of Nations, to which Poland was granted certain special rights. Most people in Danzig wished to rejoin Germany while the Poles were unwilling to see any change in Danzig's status. As German consul in Danzig, Dirksen often clashed with the Poles. As consul in Danzig, Dirksen played a prominent role in the \"postbox war\"—a lengthy struggle over whatever the postboxes in Danzig should be painted red and white (the colors of Poland) or red, white and black (the colors of the right in Germany; red, black and yellow are the colors of the left in Germany)—the latter selection of colors was a sign of the right-wing inclinations of the senate that governed the Free City of Danzig.\n\nAs the head of the Polish sub-desk within the Eastern Desk at the \"Auswärtiges Amt\", Dirksen played a key role as an aide to foreign minister Gustav Stresemann in formulating German policy towards Poland, and in 1925 Dirksen was one of the leading advocates of using economic pressure to force Poland to return the Polish Corridor, Danzig and Upper Silesia to Germany. At the beginning of 1925, Dirksen wrote that Poland would only return the Polish Corridor and Upper Silesia if Poland was \"weak\", which led him to suggest that Germany together with the \"Anglo-Saxon powers\" should follow a strategy of weakening the Polish economy to make Poland as militarily as weak as possible. Though the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" knew in fact that there was no evidence that Poland was seeking war with Germany, the Wilhelmstrasse seized upon any rumors of Polish military movements towards the German frontier to portray Poland as an aggressive and expansionist state that was a menace to the peace of Europe, which was part of a broader public relations campaign waged in Europe and the United States that emphasized the theme of \"Polish chauvinism and racial hatred\". Dirksen had successfully argued that Germany's chances of regaining the Polish Corridor, Danzig, and Upper Silesia would be better if world opinion was turned against Poland.\n\nIn a debate within \"Auswärtiges Amt\", Carl Schubert, the State Secretary of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\", argued against making loans to Germany conditional on the return of the lost territories, writing that \"only force\" would force the Poles to return the Corridor and Upper Silesia. Schubert argued that since war with Poland was not practical at the moment, Germany should make loans to Poland under onerous conditions with high-interest rates to weaken Poland economically and thereby reduce the Polish military budget until such a time when Germany was rearmed, at which point Germany would take back the lost lands via war. Dirksen by contrast also agreed that taking back the lands lost to Poland was \"inconceivable without force\", but he argued that any sort of German loans to Poland would strengthen Poland, and successfully maintained to Stresemann that Germany should not make any loans to Poland and should also try to persuade other nations not to makes loans to Poland. Following Dirksen's recommendation, Stresemann ordered Friedrich Sthamer, the German ambassador to the Court of St. James's, to lobby Montagu Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, to ask him to pressure British banks into not making any loans to Poland. In this, Sthamer was successful, reporting to Berlin that Norman felt that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh on Germany and he was willing to support Germans efforts to revise Versailles by denying Poland loans.\n\nIn November 1925, Dirksen lamented that war with Poland was not possible because of the Treaty of Versailles, which had disarmed Germany and because of the Franco-Polish alliance, saying if only Germany was rearmed, then he would be all for launching a war against Poland at once. In a memo to Stresemann on 29 December 1925, Dirksen argued that Germany should annex all of the parts of Poland that had belonged to Germany in 1914, and went on to vent his anti-Polish feelings, saying that he loathed all Poles. Unlike Stresmann, who was willing to leave the city of Poznań to the Poles, writing that Germany's chances of regaining the mostly German city of Danzig would be higher if the Germans were willing to renounce their claim on the mostly Polish city of Poznań, Dirksen was adamant that Posen, as he insisted on calling Poznań, had been German and would be so again, writing he did not feel that Germany should compromise in any way on its claims on the lands that once been German and that the frontier should be \"rounded off\" somewhere to the east. When Germany signed an arbitration treaty with Poland in 1926, Dirksen noted this only meant renouncing war with Poland was \"for the time being\", noting that from the German viewpoint the value of the treaty was only for public relations as to help portray Germany as the peaceful partner in relations with Poland.\n\nIn 1928, in a major promotion, Dirksen became the Ministerial Director of the East Division of the Foreign Office. On 28 January 1928, Dirksen attended a secret conference in Berlin with General Werner von Blomberg of the \"Truppenamt\" (the disguised General Staff), who was pressing for an invasion of Poland later that year; which Dirksen argued against, stating that under the present international conditions, \"a German-Polish war without the intervention of France or the other powers\" was very unlikely. Dirksen had to politely advise Blomberg that his belief that the \"spirit of Locarno\" had improved Franco-German relations to such an extent that France would disregard its alliance with Poland should Germany invade the latter country was an illusion.\n\nLater in 1928, Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann appointed Dirksen as Germany's Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In his memoirs, Dirksen wrote that the Soviet Union and Germany \"shared the same fate\", writing: \"Both had been vanquished in the war, both were being treated as outcasts by the Allied powers. Both felt resentment or enmity to their new neighbor Poland...Both were convinced that a give-and-take was mutually adventurous\". However, Dirksen's views towards the Soviets were entirely pragmatic, as he went on to write that as a German and therefore a \"civilized European\", he only felt \"contempt and abhorrence\" towards Communism and Russians. Dirksen supported the Soviet efforts to help Germany break the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by developing weapons that Versailles had forbidden Germany to have such as tanks and aircraft, but he wanted the German-Soviet military co-operation kept within its \"proper limits\". Since 1926, when the secret German-Soviet co-operation had become public knowledge following an exposé by \"The Manchester Guardian\", the subject was a contentious one that had strained relations with France, who did not appreciate Germany breaking Versailles to develop forbidden weapons that would one day be used against France. Dirksen wanted the development of weapons in the Soviet Union to be handled by private German companies working for the German state as much as possible, fearing that more revelations of German covert rearmament in the Soviet Union would cause too many difficulties with the French, and hinder German efforts to have Versailles revised in its favor. From the German viewpoint, convincing France that Germany did not plan to start another world war was the key to the efforts to revise Versailles, and the fact that covert rearmament was going on in the Soviet Union was not helpful to this campaign.\n\nIn his first speech in Moscow, in January 1929, Dirksen hailed the First Five Year Plan, and promised that Germany would do everything within its power to help the Soviet state achieve the targets set out by the plan. Dirksen's relations with the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Georgy Chicherin were good as he regarded Chicherin as pro-German. However, in 1930, when Maxim Litvinov replaced Chicherin, Dirksen made no secret of his dislike for Litvinov whom he charged was not really a follower of the Rapallo policy as Chicherin had been and moreover was a Jew. However, Dirksen argued in his memoirs that Litvinov's \"anti-German\" foreign policy inclinations had little influence on Joseph Stalin until 1933. In 1930–31, Dirksen negotiated a set of long-term credits for German businesses willing to sell machinery to the Soviet Union.\n\nDespite's Dirksen's best efforts, German-Soviet relations did not develop as well as he hoped. Stresemann had often used the threat of Germany leaning east towards the Soviet Union as a way of getting concessions from Britain and France in his campaign to revise the Treaty of Versailles, and by the early 1930s, the Soviets had grown tired of the way in which the Germans used the threat of friendship with them for their own purposes. Moreover, by the early 1930s, the German Protestant middle classes were gripped with the fear that the German Communist Party would use the great unemployed masses made available by the Great Depression to stage a revolution, which caused much of the Protestant middle class, starting in 1930 to vote Nazi as the \"party of order\" that would crush Marxism in Germany. In 1930, the German Foreign Minister Julius Curtius warned Dirksen that as long as the Kremlin supported the KPD, and as long as the German middle classes were obsessed with the fear of a communist revolution, which Curtius complained was being fanned by a hysterical campaign in the conservative German press which vastly exaggerated the dangers of a communist revolution in Germany, the \"Reich\" would have to keep a certain distance from the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Curtius noted that reports (which were true) that the Volga Germans were suffering terribly because of the policies of forced collectivization imposed by the First Five Year Plan made it politically toxic for Germany to get too close to the Soviet Union. Dirksen still saw the Soviet Union as a \"counterweight to the West\" and urged Curtius not to turn back completely on an eastern pivot, writing that the main enemy was still Poland, and the Soviet Union was useful as a potential ally against the Poles.\n\nHitler inspired a fierce maternal love in older, upper-class women, and in the 1920s the phenomena of the \"Hitler Mother\" emerged. The \"Hitler Mothers\" were older women, invariably from a well off background, who pampered Hitler like a son, indulging him with his favorite teas and chocolates. Dirksen's mother became a \"Hitler Mother\", launching a salon where Hitler could meet all of her upper-class friends, and as well as her son, the German ambassador to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn early 1933, Dirksen was highly concerned that the anti-Communist rhetoric of the Nazis might damage the relatively good state of German-Soviet relations. In response, Prince Bernhard von Bülow, the State Secretary of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\", sought to reassure Dirksen: \"The National Socialists faced with responsibility are naturally different people and follow a policy other than that which they have previously proclaimed. That's always been so and is the same with all parties\". Despite Bülow's assessment, German–Soviet relations started to decline, which left Dirksen very worried. Schorske called Dirksen \"...more than a loyal civil servant to the Nazis-a true if not ardent believer in Hitler\". In May 1933, Dirksen had a meeting with Hitler in which he advised the \"Führer\" that he was allowing relations with the Soviet Union to deteriorate to an unacceptable extent. Much to Dirksen's disappointment, Hitler informed him that he wished for an anti-Soviet understanding with Poland, which Dirksen protested implied recognition of the German–Polish border. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg described Dirksen as \"...a vain and pompous man who believed strongly in German co-operation with whatever country he was assigned to at the moment. His memory was sometimes poor, and his predictions frequently erroneous, but his observations on the situation in countries to which he was accredited were generally accurate...Like Neurath, Dirksen wanted to maintain tension with Poland to push for revision; Hitler preferred to wait until he was ready for wider schemes.\"\n\nIn his memoirs, Dirksen argued that there were two fractions in the Narkomindel, a \"pro-French\" fraction and a \"pro-German\" fraction, and it was not until Alfred Hugenberg's speech at the London Economic Conference in June 1933, where he argued for Germany's right to colonize the Soviet Union that decided the issue for the \"pro-French\" group. In August 1933, Dirksen was warned by the Soviet Premier Vyacheslav Molotov that the state of German–Soviet relations would depend on how friendly the \"Reich\" chose to be towards the Soviet Union. In September 1933, a major crisis occurred in German-Soviet relations when journalists from Tass and \"Izvestia\" covering the Reichstag Fire trial in Leipzig were beaten up by the SA, and Hitler's response to Soviet note of protest against the assault of the Soviet journalists was to explicitly threaten to expel all Soviet journalists from the \"Reich\" if he ever received another note of protest again and implicitly threaten to break off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union . After being warned by the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" that trade with the Soviet Union provided Germany with raw materials needed for rearmament, Hitler took certain steps to reduce tension with the Soviet Union and did not break off diplomatic relations with Moscow as he was considering doing, but at the same time, Hitler made it clear that \"a restoration of the German-Russian relationship would be impossible\". As Dirksen continued to press Hitler for a rapprochement with the Soviet Union, Hitler decided to make him his new ambassador in Japan.\n\nIn October 1933, he became the German Ambassador to Japan. On 18 October 1933 Dirksen had met Hitler and gained the impression that Hitler favored recognising Manchukuo. Hitler had met Dirksen at Gröditzberg, in Silesia. Shortly after his arrival in Tokyo, Dirksen became involved with the efforts of a shady German businessman, drug dealer, Nazi Party member and friend of Hermann Göring, Ferdinand Heye, to become Special Trade Commissioner in Manchukuo. Dirksen's backing for Heye's schemes for a monopoly of Manchurian soybeans and his advocacy of German recognition of the Empire of Manchukuo brought him into conflict with his superior, the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath, who preferred closer relations with China than with Japan. The question of recognition of Manchukuo was a litmus test for relations with both Japan and China. Against Dirksen's advocacy of recognizing Manchukuo, Neurath countered that Germany did far more trade with China than Manchukuo and so recognising Manchukuo would damage Germany's relations with China. On 18 December 1933, Dirksen was invited by the Japanese to visit Manchukuo to meet the Emperor Puyi, an invitation that Dirksen wanted to take up, but his projected visit to Manchukuo was vetoed by Neurath. Instead, Dirksen sent his economic counselor to Manchukuo to meet Puyi, a meeting that was widely then taken to indicate that Germany would be recognizing Manchukuo soon, which prompted furious protests from China.\n\nAfter Dirksen's lobbying, Heye was appointed by Hitler to be his special trade commissioner in Manchukuo and given the authority to negotiate a trade agreement with Manchukuo, but Hitler, in a communiqué, denied that recognition of Manchukuo was imminent. Dirksen was informed by Neurath that the policy of the \"Reich\" was not to recognise Manchukuo, but Germany would seek whatever trade advantages that might be gained. Despite the setback caused by the Heye affair, Dirksen continued his pro-Japanese line by declaring his sympathy for Japan's plans for the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" in return for which he expected German corporations to be allowed to play a prominent role. Those in favor of a pro-Chinese policy in the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" often countered Dirksen that in the Japanese empire, the Japanese tended to exclude all foreign corporations from operating, which led them to doubt Dirksen's claims that Germany would profit from the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\".\n\nIn early 1934, Dirksen himself came into conflict with Heye over the latter's attempts to secure not just a soybean monopoly, but over all German business in Manchuria. As Special Trade Commissioner, Heye told the Japanese that Germany would soon recognize Manchukuo and he would be the first German ambassador in Hsinking (modern Changchun, China). Heye wanted not only a soybean monopoly, but further wanted all German business and investments in Manchukuo made through a corporation run by himself and the industrialist Fritz Thyssen who would charge German firms operating in Manchukuo a 10% fee on all profits that they made in Manchukuo. In addition, Heye, acting on his own, informed the Japanese that German recognition of Manchukuo would soon be coming, a claim that strained German relations with both the Chinese (who were offended at the idea of German recognition for Manchukuo) and the Japanese (who were offended when German recognition did not come). The dispute was finally settled in February 1935 when Heye was finally disavowed by Hitler. Dirksen, a keen supporter of the \"National Revolution\" in Germany, often urged a German-Japanese rapprochement under the grounds that the Japanese plans for a \"New Order in Asia\" paralleled Germany's plans for a \"New Order in Europe\". In one dispatch to Berlin, Dirksen wrote: \"It seems to be a psychological imperative and one dictated by reasons of state that these two great powers, who are combating the status quo and promoting the dynamism of living forces, should reach an agreement.\" In 1936, Dirksen joined the Nazi Party, and henceforward always wore a Nazi Party badge.\n\nIn 1935, Dirksen wrote up a private manuscript \"Zwischenbilanz\" (\"Intermediate Balance-sheet\") recounting his life up to that point, which the American historian Robert Wistrich wrote showed him up to be \"an egocentric, ambitious and embittered man\", who complained that Hitler failed to appreciate sufficiently his loyal service, and were \"outspokenly anti-Semitic\". Dirksen boosted that he never had any Jewish friends or joined any social clubs that admitted Jews, saying he only liked the company of Aryans. In April 1936, Dirksen finally made it to Changchun and concluded a Manchukuo-German trade agreement, which did not constitute \"de jure\" German recognition of Manchukuo, which the \"Reich\" continued to proclaim was still part of China, but did constitute a \"de facto\" recognition of Manchukuo. In May 1936, Dirksen objected to the visit to China of General Walther von Reichenau, complaining that the visit to China of a such well known German general on the active list and one known moreover as one of Hitler's favorite generals, would offend Japan. At the same time, Dirksen emerged as one the proponents of signing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan, which caused tensions with the Wehrmacht who were opposed to the pact, and with Neurath, not the least which was because the plans for the Anti-Comintern Pact originated with Neurath's archenemy Joachim von Ribbentrop.\n\nIn his dispatches to Berlin, Dirksen consistently advocated Germany choosing Japan over China. In one dispatch, Dirksen argued the Kuomintang were too corrupt and disorganized to ever defeat the Chinese Communists, making it inevitable the latter would win the Chinese civil war. In a conscious echo of the Wilhelmine fear of the \"Yellow Peril\", Dirksen argued that it happened, a Communist China would ally itself with the Soviet Union, and the two would invade Europe. Happily for the \"Reich\", Dirksen argued there was a strong power in the form of Japan that had a \"civilizing mission\" in China, being willing and able to impose \"order\" on the hopelessly Chinese and stop Communism in Asia, which led him to the conclusion that Germany's Asian ally should be Japan rather than China. After the Xian Incident of December 1936, which led to the formation of the \"united front\" of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang to resist any further Japanese encroachments on China, Dirksen reported to Berlin that Japan would never stand for this, and predicted that the Japanese would strike China sometime in 1937.\n\nIn July 1937, the Sino-Japanese war began with the Marco Polo incident. Dirksen reported that his Japanese hosts were extremely unhappy that Germany was the largest supplier of arms to China, and that officers of the German military mission were training and in some cases leading the troops of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army into battle against the Imperial Japanese Army. In response to Dirksen's suggestion that the German military mission be recalled from China, the War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg proposed sending officers to the military mission in China. In late 1937, Dirksen become involved in attempts to mediate the end of the Sino-Japanese war. The Sino-Japanese war had caused a major bureaucratic power struggle within the German government with Wehrmacht and the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" supporting China while the \"Dienststelle Ribbentrop\", the SS, and the Propaganda Ministry supporting Japan. Dirksen a pro-Japanese voice in the otherwise solidly pro-Chinese \"Auswärtiges Amt\" feared his career might become marginalized as Neurath was annoyed at Dirksen's support for the pro-Japanese Ribbentrop, which led him to suggest German mediation to end the war before the struggle between the pro-Japanese and pro-Chinese factions destroyed his career. Neurath for his part, afraid that he might lose out in the power struggle with Ribbentrop, took up the suggestion of mediation as a way out while Hitler himself was indecisive about which side to back.\n\nOn 3 November 1937, the Japanese Foreign Minister Kōki Hirota gave Dirksen a set of peace terms, which Dirksen sent to Neurath, who in his turn passed them along to Oskar Trautmann, the German ambassador in China, to be handed over to the Chinese. On 7 December 1937, Dirksen met with Hirota to report that Chiang Kai-shek was willing to make peace with Japan, provided that China did not lose any more territory, but he was otherwise open to \"peace talks on the basis of Japanese peace conditions\". This posed a problem as ever since the war had begun in July 1937, Japan had never stated any war aims other than it was seeking to \"chastise\" the Chinese and that it was waging a \"holy war\" for the sake of the god-emperor of Japan. The Japanese cabinet met to begin discussions of the peace terms that Japan would seek, but on 13 December 1937, the Japanese Army took the Chinese capital of Nanjing, which caused a euphoric mood in Tokyo. The Japanese Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe decided, over the objections of the military, to escalate the war by seeking a \"total victory\" by making peace terms that he knew that Chiang could never accept. On 21 December 1937, Dirksen was presented with the Japanese peace terms to be presented to the Chinese, which were so extreme that even Dirksen remarked that they seemed written only to inspire their rejection by the Chinese. Dirksen took a very pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese line on the question of mediation, saying that if Germany had to choose between Japan and China, the choice should be the former rather than the latter. In a dispatch to the Wilhelmstrasse sent on 16 January 1938, Dirsken advised recalling the German military mission from China, ending arms sales to China, recognizing Manchukuo, and that all German investment in Kuomintang China be ended with German corporations henceforth to only invest in the part of northern China occupied by Japan. Noting that Ribbentrop was very pro-Japanese, Weinberg described Dirksen as the \"one important member of the German diplomatic corps who agreed with Ribbentrop's China policy\" and a man who did much to ensure that Germany finally recognized Manchukuo in 1938.\n\nIn early 1938, as part of the Blomberg-Fritsch affair that saw Hitler tighten his control of the foreign policy-military apparatus, Neurath was fired as Foreign Minister, and Ribbentrop, the ambassador in London, was appointed the new foreign minister. Besides forcing the War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg to retire and firing the Army's commander General Werner von Fritsch, several senior generals and diplomats were also fired, which Dirksen took advantage of by asking for a new post. Dirksen was rewarded by being made the German ambassador in London to replace Ribbentrop. The fact that Dirksen had supported Ribbentrop's pro-Japanese line against Neurath had endeared him to Ribbentrop, and furthermore, Dirksen had managed to get along well with Dr. Heinrich Georg Stahmer, the chief of the Asian desk of the \"Dienststelle Ribbentrop\", which was an additional plus for him. Moreover, Ribbentrop, wanted to promote General Eugen Ott, the German military attache to Japan, to be the ambassador in order to force the Japanese to reciprocate, and thereby promote his very good friend General Ōshima Hiroshi, the Japanese military attache to Germany, to be Japanese ambassador in Berlin. General Oshima was unique as being the only diplomat who actually liked Ribbentrop. On 4 February 1938, the same day that Hitler fired Neurath, also saw the firing of Count Ulrich von Hassell as German ambassador to Italy, and for a time, it was widely believed that Dirksen would be sent to Rome to replace Hassell. Hitler's original plan was to move Franz von Papen, the German ambassador to Austria, to Spain while Baron Eberhard von Stohrer, the German ambassador to Spain, was to go to London to replace Ribbentrop. As it was, the crisis that led to the \"Anschluss\" broke before Papen could go to Burgos (the capital of Nationalist Spain), requiring him to stay in Vienna, and Hitler decided to keep Stohrer, who had proven he could get along well with the prickly General Franco, in Burgos. Count Hans Georg von Mackensen was demoted from State Secretary and appointed the German ambassador in Rome to replace Hassell as he was Neurath's son-in-law, which made him stay on as State Secretary unacceptable to Ribbentrop. The German Embassy to the Court of St. James was one of the traditional \"grand embassies\" operated by the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" and to be appointed German ambassador to the United Kingdom was a major promotion for Dirksen, who now had one of the most prestigious ambassadorships that there was to be had in the \"Auswärtiges Amt\". Unlike Ribbentrop who was an amateur diplomat who caused an endless number of gaffes during his time as ambassador to the court of St. James, Dirksen, who was a professional diplomat, and whose appointment was very much welcomed in London as the British regarded him as \"a man of ability\", unlike his predecessor.\n\nIn 1938–39, he was German Ambassador at the Court of St. James's, being appointed on 7 April 1938. Dirksen's relations with his superior, Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, were very poor. Dirksen despised Ribbentrop as \"an unwholesome, half-comical figure\". Dirksen wrote his 1950 memoirs \"Moskau, Tokyo, London\": \"During my term of office in London, Hitler never once took the trouble of following up on British offers of negotiations, even if only as a pretense. He never even answered\". On 24 April 1938, Konrad Henlein, the leader of the Sudeten Heimatfront, which was the largest party representing the ethnic Germans in the Czechoslovak parliament, had announced the Karlsbad programme at a party congress in Karlsbad, Czechoslovakia (modern Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic) demanding wide-ranging autonomy for the Sudetenland while also announcing he was still loyal to Czechoslovakia. The German government declared its support for the Karlsbad Programme (which had been secretly drafted in March at a meeting between Hitler and Heinlein), thus beginning the crisis in Central Europe that was to end with the Munich Agreement. The apparent moderation of Germany in only demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland masked a sinister purpose, namely to make it appear that Czechoslovakia was the intransigent one in refusing to grant autonomy for the Sudetenland, thus \"forcing\" Germany to invade. Heinlein had promised Hitler that \"We must always demand so much that we can never be satisfied\".\n\nOn 3 May 1938, Dirksen presented his accreditation to King George VI at Buckingham Palace and formally become the ambassador to the court of St. James's. After arriving in London, Dirksen told Viscount Astor, that the speech of the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after the \"Anschluss\" had \"closed the door\" on further Anglo-German talks for a resolution of the problems of Europe. At his first meeting with the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, the subject was the Sudetenland question with Dirksen assuring Halifax that his government was \"very anxious to keep things quiet in Czechoslovakia\". Dirksen reported that Halifax had promised him that London together with Paris were going to send a \"démarche\" to Prague urging the Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš to make \"concessions to the utmost limit\" to the Sudeten Heimatfront, which had demanding autonomy. To show the British the apparent reasonableness of the Sudeten Heimatfront, Dirksen had Heinlein visit London starting on 12 May 1938 to meet various British politicians where he denied he was working for Hitler, talked much about the Czechs were \"oppressing\" the ethnic Germans of the Sudetenland by forcing ethnic German children to attend schools where they were taught in Czech, and insisted he only wanted autonomy for the Sudetenland, though he did admit that if Prague refused to give in to all of eight demands of the Karlsbad programme, then Germany would definitely invade Czechoslovakia. At a luncheon hosted by the National Labour MP Harold Nicolson, Heinlein met with various backbenchers from all parties, where he impressed them with his genial charm and mild-mannered ways. However, several of the MPs like the Conservative MP, General Edward Spears, expressed some concern about the parts of the Karlsbad Programme declaring that Prague should \"harmonise\" its foreign policy with Berlin's, and that to be German was to be a National Socialist and as such the Sudeten Heimatfront was to be the only legal party in the proposed autonomous Sudeten region.\n\nStarting with the May Crisis in May 1938, Dirksen received warnings from the Foreign Office that Germany should not attempt to resolve the Sudetenland dispute via war. During the May crisis, Dirksen reported to Berlin that Britain did not want to go to war with Germany for the sake of Czechoslovakia, but probably would if Germany did indeed invade Czechoslovakia. Dirsken reported that Halifax had told him that \"in the event of a European conflict it was impossible to foresee whether Britain would not be drawn into it\". Dirksen interpreted Halifax's statement as meaning that Britain probably would go to war if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, but noted that Halifax was unwilling to say this explicitly. At the same time, Dirksen was friendly with Joseph Kennedy senior, the U.S ambassador to the court of St. James. Dirksen often reported to Berlin anti-Semitic remarks on the part of Kennedy, at one point stating that Kennedy had told him: \"it was not so much the fact that we [i.e., Germany] wanted to get rid of the Jews that was so harmful to us, but rather the loud clamor with which we accomplished this purpose.”\n\nOn 8 June 1938, Dirksen was \"frankly outspoken\" on Ribbentrop in a meeting with Halifax, telling him that it was not true that Ribbentrop was an Anglophobe, and he understood that his failure as ambassador to Britain was because \"he had always felt obliged to keep one eye so much on the German end...Nonetheless, he [Ribbentrop] still wished to establish closer relations between our two countries\". Schorske wrote that everything that Dirksen told Halifax about Ribbentrop was a lie, as Ribbentrop had emerged as the loudest anti-British voice in the \"Reich\" government, who was convinced that sooner or later Germany and Britain were destined to go to war again. On the same day, Dirksen reported to Berlin about the \"psychotic\" British people who were willing to go to war with Germany, writing \"the feeling...of being made a fool of in that affair [the \"Anschluss\"], grew up again, together with the determination not to allow unchallenged further alterations in the balance of power in Europe...The attitude of the British people to the possibility of war has changed entirely since 1936. They are ready to fight should their government show them that this is necessary in order to put an end to the subjectively experienced threats and uncertainty\". Dirksen ended his dispatch with warning that Chamberlain was committed to peace, but the \"psychotic\" British people might push him into war, writing: \"To regard the excitement of the last weeks as mere bluff might turn out to be a fatal error\".\n\nAt the same time, Dirksen warned that the Chamberlain cabinet would \"without the slightest doubt\" go to war if Germany was seen to be threatening the balance of power in Europe, writing that British appeasement was based on \"the \"one\" condition that Germany would endeavor to achieve these ends by peaceful means\". Dirksen ended his dispatch of 8 June with the predication that the Chamberlain cabinet was willing to see the Sudetenland join Germany, provided it was done after a referendum and \"not interrupted by forcible measures on the part of Germany\". In July 1938, Dirksen told Albert Forster, the \"Gauleiter\" of Danzig, who was visiting London, of his belief that Britain wanted a peaceful resolution of the Czechoslovak crisis, but he believed that Britain would go to war if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia. On 11 July 1938, Dirksen met with Charles Corbin, the French ambassador to the court of St. James. Corbin reported to Paris that Dirksen had told him:\"The British people...increasingly tend to envisage the destruction of an air war as the inevitable result of German aggression against Great Britain\", which Dirksen saw as a positive development, telling Corbin that there as long as the British people believed that the Luftwaffe would destroy their cities there was less chance of British \"aggression\" against Germany. Dirksen further advised Corbin that for this reason, France should not count on the British if they decided to honor the 1924 French-Czechoslovak alliance which committed France to go to war with any nation that attacked Czechoslovakia. However, Corbin also reported that Dirksen had complained to him that \"public opinion is currently against Germany\".\n\nLater in July 1938, Dirksen was caught in the internal feuds of the Third Reich. Dirksen welcomed the secret visit to London of Captain Fritz Wiedemann, Hitler's personal adjutant, who were there representing Hermann Göring who wanted to arrange a visit to London to seek a peaceful solution to the Sudetenland dispute. Göring detested Ribbentrop, and as chief of the Four Year Plan organization, felt on economic grounds that Germany was not ready for a general war in 1938, which led him to oppose Hitler's plans to invade Czechoslovakia in autumn 1938. Göring was attempting to undercut foreign policy of Hitler and Ribbentrop by sending Wiedemann to London, a policy manoeuvre that was ruined when Dirksen told Ribbentrop that Wiedemann was in London, which enraged the Foreign Minister, who insisted quite vehemently that foreign policy was the sole preserve of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\", and led to Wiedemann being recalled. In early August 1938, Dirksen returned to Berlin to tell Hitler personally of his belief that Britain would go to war if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, a message that the Führer was not interested in. Hitler generally ignored Dirksen in August–September 1938, but Dirksen was in contact with several Nazis such as Rudolf Hess and Fritz Bohle, expressing his concerns that Hitler might trigger a general war by going ahead with his plans to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October 1938.\n\nIn September 1938, at the Nuremberg Party Congress, Dirksen met Hitler, where he told him of his fears of a general war, and of his belief that the British were prepared to pressure the Czechoslovak government into ceding the Sudetenland to Germany as the price for peace. Hitler was not interested at this point in either a peaceful resolution of the Sudetenland dispute or in Dirksen's views. During the Nuremberg Party Congress, Hitler in his keynote speech on 12 September 1938 laid claim to the Sudetenland, and announced if the Sudetenland was not allowed to join Germany by 1 October, he would invade Czechoslovakia, escalating the crisis and taking Europe to the brink of war. In the crisis of September 1938 that led to the Munich Agreement, Dirksen played only a small role, but as a diplomat with an elegant bearing and aristocratic manners whose fluent English and polite ways charmed many in Britain, Dirksen was the respectable face of Nazi Germany in Britain in 1938. As a professional diplomat and an aristocrat, Dirksen enjoyed a good rapport with the British elite, and his insistence that Hitler was only seeking to correct the \"injustices\" of Versailles and not dominate Europe impressed many of the British policy-makers he met. Unlike Ribbentrop, whose arrogance and ignorance led him to commit many social gaffes, the eminently \"correct\" Dirksen with his perfect gentlemanly manners made a favourable impression in London. Right after the Munich Agreement and the Anglo-German Declaration, both signed on 30 September 1938, Dirksen was told by Ribbentrop that the Anglo-German Declaration, which committed the two nations never to go to war again, meant nothing to Hitler. However, knowing that Chamberlain attached great importance to the declaration was told to act like it did.\n\nIn October 1938, in a dispatch to Berlin, Dirksen reported that British public reaction to Hitler's Saarbrücken speech on 3 October 1938, when Hitler stated that Germany would not tolerate British \"interference\" in the affairs of Europe was highly negative. Dirksen also advised Hitler to stop attacking by name two Conservative backbenchers in the House of Commons, namely Anthony Eden and Winston Churchill, saying his speeches gave more attention in the British press to Eden and Churchill than otherwise would be the case. Finally, Dirksen reported that based on his meetings with members of the British cabinet that he believed that the Chamberlain government was seeking an Anglo-German détente and advised that Germany take up the British offer of \"disarmament\" (in the 1930s the term \"disarmament\" referred to arms limitation), which he predicated would lead to Chamberlain offering to return to Germany the former African colonies now ruled by Britain. In response, Baron Ernst von Weizsäcker, the State Secretary of the \"Auswärtiges Amt\", wrote back to Dirksen to say that campaign in the German media bashing British rearmament \"was instigated on the direct orders of the Foreign Minister\". Schorske noted that a \"striking\" aspect of the line of Anglo-German negotiations that Dirksen wanted to pursue in October 1938 was it reflected Chamberlain's priorities such as disarmament and the possible return of the former German colonies in Africa and did not reflect Hitler's priorities such as Czecho-Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia had been renamed in October 1938), the Memelland and Poland. In the last two weekends of October 1938, Dirksen made visits to the English countryside to meet Sir Samuel Hoare and Leslie Burgin for talks concerning an Anglo-German détente. Dirksen reported to the Wilhelmstrasse that both Hoare and Burgin wanted talks about an Anglo-German treaty that would end the arms race; another treaty that would \"humanise\" air war with bombing of cities and chemical weapons to be banned; a colonial settlement for returning the former German colonies in Africa in exchanges for promises of no war in Europe; and a British \"guarantee\" to protect Germany from the Soviet Union. The British historian D.C. Watt wrote: \"This last is often cited by Soviet historians as proof of their thesis that the Cabinet was obsessed with the urge to provoke a German-Soviet war. Taken in its proper context, Hoare's ill-chosen remarks make it clear that the offer of a guarantee was intended to disarm any German arguments that Soviet strength in the air necessitated the maintenance of a large German Luftwaffe\".\n\nThree weeks after the Munich Agreement, which Dirksen had predicted would make possible an Anglo-German détente, Weizsäcker wrote to Dirksen: \"Things here are moving rapidly, but not in the direction of Anglo-German rapprochement at present\". In November 1938, Dirsken complained about the \"Kristallnacht\" pogrom solely under the grounds that it damaged Germany's image in Britain, making no moral condemnation of the pogrom at all. At the beginning of December 1938, Dirksen formally announced that his government planned to use the clauses in the Anglo-Naval Agreement to build a submarine fleet equal to Britain's, and would upgrade two cruisers under construction from the 6-inch guns they were meant to have to having 8-inch guns instead. In December 1938, Dirksen resumed his efforts for Anglo-German détente, hoping to negotiate a series of Anglo-German economic agreements as the starting point. In December 1938, Chamberlain gave a speech at a formal dinner of the correspondents of the German News Agency in London with Dirksen present. When Chamberlain spoke of the \"futility of ambition, if ambition leads to the desire for domination\", Dirksen, who interpreted that remark as an implied criticism of Hitler, led all of the assembled German journalists in walking out in protest.\n\nIn January 1939, Dirksen opened up talks with the Foreign Office for an Anglo-German coal agreement. Hitler had authorised the Anglo-German economic talks in January 1939 as a smokescreen for the anti-British turn in his foreign policy, approving the Z Plan on 27 January 1939 for a gigantic fleet that was meant to crush the Royal Navy by 1944. The Z Plan called for six H-class battleships with 20-inch guns that would have been the largest battleships ever built had they actually been constructed, dwarfing even the \"Yamato\" class battleships of Japan that were in fact the largest battleships ever built with their 18-inch guns. Building such truly colossal battleships took time and money, thus requiring a period of Anglo-German peace. A notable contradiction existed in Hitler's strategic planning in 1939 between embarking on an anti-British foreign policy, whose major instruments consisted of a vastly expanded \"Kriegsmarine\" and a Luftwaffe capable of a strategic bombing offensive that would take several years to build (e.g. Plan Z for expanding the \"Kriegsmarine\" was a five-year plan), and engaging in reckless short-term actions such as attacking Poland that were likely to cause a general war. Ribbentrop, for his part, because of his status as the Nazi British expert, resolved Hitler's dilemma by supporting the anti-British line and by repeatedly advising Hitler that Britain would not go to war for Poland in 1939.\n\nIn February 1939, Dirksen invited Sir Oliver Stanley, the president of the Board of Trade, to visit Germany for economic talks in Berlin, which was taken as a sign in London that Germany wanted better relations. Dirksen also tried to have the Economics minister Walther Funk visit London for economics talks, but this was vetoed by Ribbentrop as a threat to his turf. Dirksen told the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax not to take personally the anti-British campaign in the German media that had been launched in November 1938, saying this was just a negotiating tactic and not preparation for war, going on to say that Ribbentrop was not really an Anglophobe and was willing to come to London to personally sign an Anglo-German nonaggression pact. In early March 1939, Dirksen visited Berlin, where Ribbentrop told him that Germany was going to violate the Munich Agreement later that month by occupying the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia, saying that Prague would be German by the middle of the month. After his return to London on 9 March 1939, Dirksen recalled in his memoirs that he \"found the same optimistic mood that had prevailed in February. Stanely's visit to Berlin was to take place soon – on March 17 – and it was obvious that the British government attached great importance to it\".\n\nShortly afterward, Dirksen welcomed to London Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the \"Frauenfuhrerin\" who ran the NSDAP's women branch, who come to Britain to study \"social conditions\" affecting British women. Scholtz-Klink was a fanatical Nazi who was praised by Hitler as \"the ideal National Socialist woman\". At the dinner to welcome Scholtz-Klink at the Claridge's by the Anglo-German Association was attended by an impressive collection of British high society women including Lady Violet Astor, the Dowager Marchioness of Reading, the Conservative MP Florence Horsbrugh, the Dowager Countess of Airlie, Lady Cynthia Colville, and the presidents of the National Women's Citizens Association, the National Council of Women of Great Britain, and the National Council for Maternity and Child Welfare. Dirksen reported that the dinner went well and the British women were very interested in what Scholtz-Klink had to say, though the fact that she spoke no English and needed an interpreter imposed problems. However, Scholtz-Klink's visit to London sparked protests by British feminists outside the German embassy with women carrying signs written in German reading \"Freedom for the women of Hitler's concentration camps\".\n\nOn 15 and 16 March 1939, during meetings with Lord Halifax, following the German occupation of the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia, he received warnings that Britain would go to war to resist any Germany attempt to dominate the world, and Britain might attempt a policy of \"containment\" following this violation of the Munich Agreement. Dirksen's meetings with Lord Halifax were described as very \"stormy\" as Halifax chided him for the way his government had just violated the Munich Agreement. Dirksen in response stated that the Treaty of Versailles was \"unjust\" to the \"Reich\", that Czechoslovakia had been created by Versailles, and therefore the destruction of Czecho-Slovakia was justified as Germany was just undoing the \"unjust\" terms of Versailles. Halifax was not impressed with this argument, telling Dirksen that his government had promised in the Munich Agreement to respect the sovereignty of Czecho-Slovakia and for him keeping a promise was the mark of men of honor. Halifax, an aristocrat from Yorkshire, had felt a certain affinity for Dirksen, an aristocrat from Silesia, for which reason he found dishonesty from Dirksen to be especially reprehensible, telling Dirksen that gentleman do not lie to one another. In his reports to Berlin, Dirksen toned down Halifax's language and remarks-especially the parts where Lord Halifax criticized Dirksen for not behaving like a gentleman and an aristocrat by lying to him-while the British transcripts showed that Halifax was a far more angrier man than what Dirksen's reports would suggest.\n\nOn 17 March 1939, Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham to the Birmingham Unionist Association saying that if Germany wanted to dominate the world, then Britain would go to war rather than accept a world dominated by the \"Reich\". In his speech, Chamberlain wondered aloud that if by occupying Prague Germany had taken \"a step in the direction to dominate the world by force?\", going on to say if Germany wanted to \"challenge\" Britain for world domination that \"no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing, this nation has so lost its fiber that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it ever were made\". In a long report about the Birmingham speech sent to Berlin on 18 March 1939, Dirksen wrote: \"It would be wrong to cherish any illusions that a fundamental change has not taken place in Britain's attitude to Germany\".\n\nDirksen took a contradictory line in the spring and summer of 1939, torn as he was between his desire to see a war that would wipe Poland off the map vs. his fear of starting a world war that Germany might lose. Dirksen was extremely anti-Polish and had often called for the destruction of Poland, so he was supportive of \"Fall Weiss\" (Case White), the German plan for an invasion of Poland. Schorske wrote that Dirksen \"believed firmly in the justice of Hitler's anti-Polish policy. Like most German nationalists, he held the Poles in complete contempt, a contempt fortified in his case by service in Warsaw and Danzig during his younger years\". When Britain offered the \"guarantee\" of Poland on 31 March 1939, Dirksen protested to Lord Halifax that: \"Britain, by her guarantee to Poland, placed the peace of the world in the hands of minor Polish officials and military men\".\n\nDirksen's policy in the Danzig crisis was one to attempting to sever Britain from Poland so Germany could attack the latter without fear of war with the former. Dirksen was all for a war with Poland in 1939, but less so for a war with Britain, hence his repeated efforts to sever Britain from Poland by trying to persuade the British to give up the \"guarantee\" of Poland. In his meetings with Lord Halifax in the spring of and summer of 1939, Dirksen often told him about \"Polish adventurism and moral turpitude\", attacking the British quite violently for being so \"foolish\" as to make a \"guarantee\" of a people whom Dirksen insisted were completely undeserving of British protection. Dirksen reported to Weizsäcker that he wanted \"to enlighten the English, who are unsophisticated in continental and especially East European affairs, on the nature of the Polish state, and on our claims to Danzig and the Corridor\". About the British efforts to create a \"peace front\" to \"contain\" Germany, Dirksen told Halifax that the entire German people were \"unanimously determined to parry this danger of encirclement and not to tolerate a repetition of 1914\". Despite Dirksen's attempts to argue that the Free City of Danzig, which was 90% German, should be allowed to return to the \"Reich\", the German occupation of the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia on 15 March 1939 meant the British were not receptive to his appeals in 1939 as they had been in 1938 with the Sudetenland. As Lord Halifax put it on 20 July 1939:\nStarting on 14 April 1939, and continuing right up to 16 August 1939, the German Embassy in London received on a weekly basis anonymously mailed packages containing decrypted diplomatic cables from the Foreign Office to the British Embassy in Moscow and back that were carefully edited to make it appear that Anglo-Soviet relations were far better than what there were, and that the talks to have the Soviet Union join the \"peace front\" were going well. Dirksen was not entirely certain where the packages were coming from or the precise veracity of their contents, but he passed them on along back to Berlin, saying this intelligence might be useful. Two cipher clerks in the Foreign Office, John King and Ernest Oldham, had independently of each both sold in the early 1930s the Foreign Office's codes to the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, and as a result, the Soviets were reading all of the Foreign Office's cables all through the 1930s. The mysterious packages were from the NKVD who wanted to make it appear that an Anglo-Soviet alliance was in the offering as a way of frightening Germany to come to terms with Moscow.\n\nOn 18 May 1939, during a meeting with Lord Halifax, Dirksen was informed that the \"Reich\" should have no illusions about Britain's willingness to go to war, and if Germany should attack Poland, then Britain would go to war. In response, an angry Dirsken told Halifax that Germany's policy had always been and still was to peacefully seek to revise the Treaty of Versailles, that Germany had no intention of invading Poland, and Halifax had fallen victim to anti-German hysteria in believing otherwise. Dirksen often reported to Berlin that the British efforts to built a \"peace front\" were floundering over the question of including the Soviet Union. On 27 May 1939, Chamberlain told the House of Commons that the cabinet had instructed Sir William Seeds, the British ambassador in Moscow, to open discussions about a military alliance. Dirken reported to the Wilhelmstrasse that Chamberlain had opened the talks with the Soviets \"with the greatest reluctance\", and that he was not keen on an alliance with the Soviet Union. Dirksen further reported that the British had learned about the \"German feelers in Moscow\" and were \"afraid that Germany might succeed in keeping Soviet Russia neutral or even inducing her to adopt benevolent neutrality. That would have meant the complete collapse of the encirclement action\".\n\nOn 24 June 1939, Dirksen in a dispatch to Berlin reported his efforts to turn the British against the \"guarantee\" of Poland were bearing fruit and stated that he believed the British government was moving away from the \"encirclement\" of Germany towards a \"more constructive policy\" towards the \"Reich\". Dirksen reported on the same day that British public opinion had been caught up in anti-German \"hysteria\" in the spring, but he now believed that public opinion was in a \"state of flux\" as the full implications of war with Germany were starting to sink in. As evidence, Dirksen quoted to Weizsäcker from several letters to the editor of \"The Times\" attacking the Poles for refusing to allow Danzig to rejoin Germany and criticizing Chamberlain for the \"guarantee\" of Poland, which for Dirksen was proof that British public opinion was changing. Dirksen also wrote that \"a surprise initiative on the part of Chamberlain is within the bounds of probability and it is quite possible that rumor current here, that he will approach Germany with new proposals after the completion of the negotiations with the Russians will materialize into fact in one form or another\". In Dirksen's viewpoint, the proposed alliance with the Soviet Union that would form the eastern anchor of the \"peace front\" was merely a negotiating tactic for a Munich-type deal to resolve the Danzig crisis rather a means of deterring Germany from invading Poland.\n\nIn early July 1939, Dirksen reported to the Wilhelmstrasse that British public opinion would come to understand that the \"justice\" of the German demand that the Free City of Danzig be allowed to rejoin Germany. Dirksen wrote: \"The wave of excitement will ebb as soon as it rose, as soon as the proper conditions exist. The most important condition is a quieter atmosphere in England which will permit a more unprejudiced examination of the German viewpoint. The germs of this already exist. Within the Cabinet and a small, but influential group of politicians, a desire is manifested to pass from the negativity of the encirclement front to a more constructive policy towards Germany. And however strong the counter-forces trying to stifle this tender plant may be-Chamberlain's personality is a certain guarantee that a British policy will not be placed in the hands of unscrupulous adventurers (i.e Churchill, Eden, etc).\" About the British efforts to build a \"peace front\", Dirksen explained this to Berlin as a result of a \"dual policy\" of the part of the Chamberlain government. Dirksen reported: \"England wants by means of armament and the acquisition of allies to make herself strong and equal to the Axis, but at the same time she wants by means of negotiation to seek an adjustment with Germany and is prepared to make sacrifices for it: on the question of colonies, raw materials supplies, \"Lebensraum\", and spheres of economic influence\". In private, Dirksen complained that the relentless Anglophobia of Ribbentrop was unnecessarily inflaming Anglo-German relations as Ribbentrop persisted in presenting to Hitler every move in British foreign policy in the worse possible light, and he told the Foreign Office in an \"off-the-record\" meeting that a high-level Englishman who was fluent in German (Hitler only spoke German) should visit Berlin to meet Hitler to tell him that an Anglo-German rapprochement was still possible.\n\nOn 17 July 1939, Helmuth Wohlthat, Hermann Göring's deputy in the Four Year Plan organization, attended the meeting of the International Whaling Conference in London as part of the German delegation, and the next day, he and Dirksen met Sir Horace Wilson, the Chief Industrial Adviser to the Government and one of Chamberlain's closest friends. Wilson decided to talk to Wohlthat of the Four Year Plan Organisation rather than the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" run by the Anglophobic Ribbentrop. Without informing Ribbentrop, Dirksen allowed the Wilson-Wohlthat meetings in London to go ahead, where Wilson offered in an exchange for a German promise not to attack Poland and a \"renunciation of aggression in principle\" as a way of solving international disputes, an Anglo-German nonaggression pact, a \"delimitation of spheres of influence\" in Europe and a plan for the \"international governance\" of Africa where all of the great powers of Europe would jointly administer Africa. However, Wilson did make clear to Wohlthat that he regarded Germany as the source of the tension between Germany and Poland by laying claim to Danzig, and he made it clear that the onus was on the \"Reich\" to reduce tension with Poland, not the other way around; Lord Halifax told Dirksen much the same thing at the same time. Dirksen and Wohlthat argued that Wilson and another British civil servant Robert Hudson had given them a memo entitled \"Programme for German-British Cooperation\", but Wilson denied having given them such a document, and in his account of the meeting to the Foreign Office suggested that neither Wohlthat nor Dirksen seemed very serious as both expected all of the concessions to come from the British side with Germany making none.\n\nOn 20 July 1939, Robert Hudson of the Department of Overseas Trade, visited the German embassy to meet Dirksen and Wohlthat. Hudson, an ambitious civil servant and a former Conservative MP who was addicted to intrigue, was acting on his own, hoping to score a great success that would help his otherwise stalled career. In a somewhat vainglorious account of his meeting at the German embassy, Hudson spoke of about having Danzig rejoin Germany with Germany promising to leave Poland alone. According to Hudson's notes, in exchange for a German promise not to invade Poland and ending the Anglo-German arms race, there would be a plan for the industrialists running the heavy industry of Germany, Britain and the United States to work together in the economic development of China, Eastern Europe and Africa; of a loan in sum of hundreds of millions for Germany to be floated in the City and on Wall Street; and some sort of plan for the \"international governance\" of Africa, and he ended his account by saying that if only Hitler would just learn to think in economic terms, much was possible. A preening Hudson-who believed that he had more or less single-handedly saved the world from the threat of another world war with his visit to the German Embassy-unwisely showed his notes recording what he had said to a group of journalists, telling them \"off-the-record\" it was he who just ended the Danzig crisis with his bold proposals for Anglo-German economic co-operation as Wohlthat was definitely interested in what he had to say. Hudson asked the journalists not to publish yet, saying his plan needed more time, but two of the journalists decided that the story was news and decided to publish. On 22 July 1939, \"The Daily Telegraph\" and the \"News Chronicle\" both broke the story on their front-pages that Britain just had offered Germany a loan worth hundreds of millions of pound sterling in exchange for not attacking Poland. The public reaction to this story was highly negative with much of the press calling Hudson's proposed loan \"Danegeld\". In order to stop Viking raids and attacks, the English kings had sometimes paid \"Danegeld\" (\"Dane money\") to bribe the Danes from attacking-ever since that time, the term \"paying the Danegeld\" in England implies weakness and cowardice, that someone would rather bribe their way out of trouble rather than stand up for oneself. By calling Hudson's proposed loan to Germany \"Danegeld\", the British newspapers were in effect saying Hudson was a coward. Much to Hudson's humiliation, Chamberlain told the House of Commons that no such loan was being considered and that Hudson was speaking for himself.\n\nBased on his meetings with Wilson, Dirksen advised on 24 July 1939 taking up Wilson's offer to discuss how best to peacefully return Danzig to Germany, saying the \"Reich\" had to make a move soon if \"Churchill and the other incendiaries\" in the backbenches were to be stopped from toppling the Chamberlain government. Dirksen approved of the Wilson-Wohltat meetings as he felt it was possible to reach an Anglo-German deal with Göring, a much more pragmatic Nazi than Ribbentrop. Dirksen found his room to maneuver had been greatly reduced by the Hudson affair hitting the press, and found it difficult to contact Wohlthat after he returned to Germany on 21 July 1939. It was not until late August that Dirksen finally saw the report that Wohlthat had given Göring his return to Berlin in late July. Dirksen had supported the Wilson-Wohlthat meetings, but had managed to hide his role enough as to make it appear he was only a minor player, in order to protect himself from Ribbentrop, as he knew he would disapprove. On 31 July 1939, Ribbentrop in a message to Dirksen attacked him severely for allowing the Wilson-Wohlthat talks to even take place, saying the British had no business in talking to one of Göring's men, and demanded that the British conduct any negotiations only with him. Dirksen only managed to save himself from worse trouble by presenting Wilson as the man who initiated the talks, which he portrayed to Ribbentrop as a sign of British weakness. Ribbentrop had no interest in any sort of talks to resolve the German-Polish dispute as he wanted a war in 1939 with the Danzig dispute being a mere pretext. Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, the German ambassador to Poland, had been ordered by Ribbentrop not to conduct talks with the Poles as it always Ribbentrop's great fear in 1939 that the Poles might actually agree to the Free City of Danzig rejoining Germany, and for the same reason Ribbentrop always refused to see Józef Lipski, the Polish ambassador to Germany.\n\nOnly nine hours after Ribbentrop had attacked Dirksen for allowing the Wilson-Wohlthat talks to occur and ordered him to sabotage the talks, Weizsäcker sent Dirksen a cable asking him if the British were prepared to sever their commitments to Poland and how serious were the British about having the Soviet Union join the \"peace front\". Dirksen in response sent Weizsäcker a cable stating \"leading personages\" in London were willing to abandon Poland if Germany promised not to take Danzig by force, and the entire strategy of the \"peace front\" would be disregarded if Germany was willing to take up the offers made by Wilson to Wohlthat. As for the Soviet Union joining the \"peace front\", Dirksen reported: \"The continuation of negotiations for a pact with Russia, in spite of – or rather, just because of – the dispatch of a military mission is regarded here with skepticism. This is borne out by the composition of the British military mission: the admiral, until now the Commandant of Portsmouth, is practically in retirement, and was never on the staff of the Admiralty; the general is likewise purely a combat officer; the air general is an outstanding aviator and air instructor, but not a strategist. This indicates the value of the military mission is more to ascertain the fighting value of the Soviet Army rather than to make operational arrangements...The Wehrmacht attachés are agreed in observing a surprising skepticism in British military circles about the forthcoming talks with the Soviet armed forces.\" Dirksen also noted the British military mission to the Soviet Union headed by Admiral Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax was taking a ship, the \"City of Exeter\" not noted for its speed to take them to Soviet Russia, which he used to argue that British were not really serious about having the Soviet Union join the \"peace front\". Dirksen believed this report would win Hitler to a plan to \"chemically dissolve the Danzig problem\" (i.e. not seek war), but instead Ribbentrop used Dirksen's report to argue to Hitler that the British were cowards unwilling to go war for Poland, as proven by Dirksen's statement that the British were not really interested in having the Soviet Union join the \"peace front\".\n\nOn 3 August 1939, Dirksen had his final meeting with Wilson. The accounts left by Dirksen and Wilson of this meeting are so different that they are impossible to reconcile. Wilson's account has him insisting it was Germany that had to take the initiative to end the Danzig crisis, and with him pressing Dirksen on why Hitler was not acting on this back-channel he opened to try to end the crisis. Dirksen, by contrast, portrayed Wilson as desperate for any sort of concession and reproduced Wilson's warnings of war as an expression of British fear of German might. The Canadian historian Michael Jabara Carley summarized the differences between the German and British accounts of the Wilson-Dirksen meeting as: \"According to Wilson, Dirksen proposed an agenda of items that would interest Hitler, according to Dirksen, Wilson confirmed what he had suggested to Wohlthat, including a non-aggression pact and trade negotiations\". Most notably, Dirksen has Wilson saying that the proposed Anglo-German non-aggression pact would both cancel out the \"guarantee\" to Poland and the negotiations with the Soviet Union, with the clear implication that Germany would have all of Eastern Europe in exchange for leaving the British empire alone. Dirksen also has Wilson saying that these negotiations must be kept secret as any leak would so anger the British people that it might bring down the Chamberlain government and he wanted the Anglo-German talks to be held in secret in Switzerland, a statement that does not appear in Wilson's notes of the meeting. Historians have greatly differed over which version of the Wilson-Dirksen meeting is the correct one. The American historian Zachery Shore argued that Dirksen had no reason to fabricate such an offer from Wilson, and Chamberlain was in fact seeking to begin secret negotiations for an Anglo-German nonaggression pact in Switzerland that would have seen Britain abandon Poland. By contrast, the British historian D.C. Watt has argued for the veracity of Wilson's notes, arguing that there is no evidence on the British seeking such a pact, and such a pact if signed would have probably brought down the Chamberlain government.\n\nAt times, Dirksen reported in his dispatches to Ribbentrop that British public opinion was tired of appeasement, and that Britain would go to war if Germany attacked Poland. However, Dirksen noted that the British \"guarantee\" of Poland issued on 31 March 1939 was only of Polish independence, not of the borders of Poland, and he believed based on contacts with British politicians that another Munich-type deal was possible under which the Free City of Danzig would rejoin Germany. At other times, Dirksen reported to Berlin that Britain would not honour the Anglo-Polish military alliance, and would back down if Germany invaded that nation. In August 1939 Dirksen reported that Chamberlain knew “the social structure of Britain, even the conception of the British Empire, would not survive the chaos of even a victorious war”, and so he would abandon the commitments to Poland. Dirksen's messages about Britain unwilling to go to war for the defense of Poland had the effect of convincing Hitler that any German attack on Poland would result only in a localized German–Polish war, not a world war.\n\nTo prevent any British offer that might stop the war, Ribbentrop ordered that none of his ambassadors in London, Paris, and Warsaw should be at their posts. On 14 August 1939, Dirksen arrived in Berlin to take a vacation in Germany, and was told by Weizsäcker that he was under no conditions to return to London. At the same time, Weizsäcker also informed Count Johannes von Welczeck, the German ambassador in Paris, and Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, the German ambassador in Warsaw, who had also been ordered to take a vacation in Germany, that neither men were to return to their posts. Dirksen in his turn mentioned this to Baron Bernardo Attolico, the Italian ambassador in Berlin, saying it was going to be war for certain this summer, observing that if his country wanted a peaceful resolution of the Danzig crisis, then the ambassadors to Britain, France and Poland would be ordered to return to their embassies. Attolico reported this to Rome, and as the Germans had broken the Italian diplomatic codes, Dirksen was summoned to the Wilhelmstrasse by Ribbentrop to be screamed at and berated for his incompetence, and to be told he was now excluded from all political discussions as a security risk. When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, this was followed by a British declaration of war on Germany on 3 September, an effect of which was the ruin of Dirksen's diplomatic career, and he never held a major post again.\n\nDirksen spent most of the war at Gröditzberg and his estate in Silesia at Gröditz (now Grodziec, Poland). As a leading expert on the subject, Dirksen often gave talks on the Soviet Union at various locales throughout Europe, such as to Wehrmacht generals, most notably Field Marshal Erich von Manstein visited Gröditzberg to ask Dirksen for advice. As much of the farm labourers who worked Dirksen's estate was called up for service with the Wehrmacht, Dirksen used slave labour from Poland as replacement workers to tend to the sugar beet fields on his estate. In 1943, Dirksen published a picture book, \"Freundesland im Osten ein Nipponbuch in Bildern\", containing a collection of photographs of daily Japanese life that he had taken during his time as an ambassador in Tokyo.\n\nIn February 1945, Gröditzberg was taken by the Red Army. Dirksen chose to stay, believing that he could serve as a mediator between the Soviet Union and Germany. The Red Army plundered the castle but became more respectful when Dirksen showed them a photograph taken in the early 1930s of himself and the Defense Commissar, Marshal Kliment \"Klim\" Voroshilov. Voroshilov was unique under Stalin as being the only member of the Soviet Politburo allowed to have a personality cult of his own. Ribbentrop believed that Dirksen would betray secrets to the Soviets and ordered him to be taken back. An Abwehr team was infiltrated into Gröditzberg, arriving at the castle to tell Dirksen that he was coming with them regardless of what he might think. On a cold February night, Dirksen and the Abwehr team walked through the frozen fields back to the German lines. Dirksen left behind his private papers at the castle, which were captured by the Red Army. In 1948, the Narkomindel published a very selective version of Dirksen's papers dealing with his time as ambassador in London to support the official Soviet historical line that British appeasement had been aimed at causing a German-Soviet war in order to save British capitalism, thus justifying the German-Soviet pact of 1939 to thwart the alleged British scheme.\n\nIn 1947, Dirksen was cleared by a denazification court, which declared him not an active party member. In 1950, Dirksen published his memoirs \"Moskau, Tokyo, London\", recounting his career as a diplomat in the Soviet Union, Japan and the United Kingdom. In it, he stated quite flatly that he was not ashamed that he had joined the Nazi Party in 1936 as the régime had achieved \"impressive\" political and economic changes in Germany.\n\nIn a review of the book, the American historian Fritz Epstein noted that there were significant differences between the German original of the book published in 1950 and the English version published in 1952. One is that the section dealing with Dirksen's time as a diplomat in the Netherlands in 1917 had been reduced from 3 pages to 6 lines. Also, his time as a diplomat in Kiev dealing with the puppet regime of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi had 6 pages in the German original but 3 pages in the English edition.\n\nIn another review, Canadian scholar Frank Tresnak asked about the differences between Germany's traditional elite and the Nazi elite. He answered, \"If were we are to judge by this book, there seems to have been precious little\".\n\nTresnak continued: \"From 1919 onward, the common aim of almost all Germans was to achieve the abolition of the Versailles \"diktat\"–a treaty which just or unjust, was an adequate expression of the German defeat of 1918, after a war which Germany herself started\". Tresnak wrote that Dirksen's memoirs showed that he was on all essentials in full agreement with Hitler's plans to destroy the international order that had been established by the Treaty of Versailles and to have Germany become the world's strongest power. They differed only on the precise strategy and tactics to be employed. Tresnak ended his review by remarking: \"He has tears aplenty for torn and defeated Germany, but not a word of sympathy for the millions of murdered Jews, Poles, Yugoslavs, Czechs, and the rest... After reading Herr von Dirksen's book, one cannot help feeling that he, and perhaps other Germans as well, condemn Hitler chiefly on the grounds that he did not win the war–though sometimes they act as they are not aware that he lost it\".\n\nIn a review, American political scientist Joseph Schectman noted that Dirksen expressed much anger in his memoirs about the expulsions of Germans from Eastern Europe but mentioned not even once that Germany had killed about 1,500,000 Poles and 6,000,000 Jews in the war. Schectman noted that seemed to be Dirksen's way of saying that only the lives of Germans matter, not the lives of Poles and Jews.\n\nBaron Tilo von Wilmowsky, the husband of Barbara von Krupp and a senior executive at the firm of Krupp AG, then Germany's biggest corporation, had become involved in a campaign to \"clear the rubble\" cast against German big business. Wilmowsky's preferred instrument was Henry Regnery, a conservative Germanophile American publisher based in Chicago who specialized in publishing books that sought to deny that Germany's traditional elites were anyway involved with National Socialist crimes, and they portrayed Allied policies towards Germany both during and after World War II as cruel and unjust. It published such conservative classics like \"God and Man at Yale\" by William F. Buckley and \"The Conservative Mind\" by Russell Kirk, and it had also published strongly-antiwar books such as \"Politics, Trials and Errors\" by Royal Marine General Maurice Hankey. They vigorously denounced war crimes trials and argued for the innocence of all German and Japanese leaders convicted of war crimes. Also, it published \"Victor's Justice\", by Montgomery Belgion, which condemned the Allied policies of bringing Nazi war criminals to justice as cruel and barbaric, and \"The High Cost of Vengeance\", by Freda Utley, which argued that the Allied policies towards Germany had been criminal and inhumane.\n\nIn 1950, Wilmoswky used Dirksen, together with Heinrich Brüning, Franz von Papen and Belgion as his major advisers on the latest book that Regnery was going to publish, which was intended to deny that industrialists like him had supported the Nazi regime and had used slave labour during World War II. The industrialist Baron Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, who had effectively ran Krupp AG during World War II, had been convicted by an American court of using slave labour, and Wilmowsky wanted to rebut that charge. In a letter, Dirksen advised Wilmowsky that it would \"psychologically better\" if the book was presented as a \"neutral investigation of industrialists in the total state and total war\", comparing both industrial mobilization in the Allied and Axis nations, rather than focusing on the actions of German industrialists. Dirksen argued that if the mobilization of industrialists by the state in times of war were to be presented as a universal trend, the specific acts by German industrialists like using slave labour could be explained away as part of a universal tendency. Dirksen felt such a book would be useful in ending the \"Nuremberg complex\" held against Germany and argued that it was time that people stop holding Nazi crimes against Germany.\n\nBelgion wrote to Dirksen: \"My own feeling is that such a book... would not appeal to the general public unless it could be cast in the form of a dramatic story and that would require on the part of the author a rare combination of gifts–an understanding of the problems of large-scale business and also an ability to give the exposition of them a magic touch. I do not myself know of any English or American author who possesses that combination.\"\n\nAfter much searching for an author, Wilmowsky's book was finally published by Regnery in 1954 as \"Tycoons and the Tyrant: German industry from Hitler to Adenauer\" by Louis P. Lochner, which portrayed German industrialists as victims of Hitler, and it argued it was not their fault that they ended up using slave labour in their factories.\n\nDirksen was active in the 1950s in groups that represented Germans expelled from Silesia and rejected the Oder–Neisse line as Germany's eastern frontier. In 1954, Dirksen called a press conference to criticize Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's policy of western integration. He instead argued that West Germany should try to play off the Western powers against the Soviet Union to achieve German reunification.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1918324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918324", "title": "Kalkallo, Victoria", "text": "Kalkallo, Victoria\n\nKalkallo is a town in Victoria, Australia, 33 km north of the Melbourne city centre. It is local government area is the City of Hume. At the 2016 Census, Kalkallo had a population of 105.\n\nLocated on the Hume Freeway, Kalkallo has a few streets, a service station and a pub. It is surrounded by farms not yet developed by the urban sprawl of Melbourne. The nearest access to public transport is the Donnybrook railway station which is serviced by regional V/Line trains.\n\nThe Kalkallo area is located on the traditional lands of the people of the Woiwurrung. It is believed that the clan which occupied land including the South Morang area was the Wurundjeri William. \nColonisation occurred in Victoria from 1835, and land sales commenced in the Parish of Kalkallo in 1840.\nAn example of an early rural town settlement, Kalkallo contains many natural and cultural heritage sites of significance including churches, hotels, monuments, bridges, waterways and grasslands. \nIn 1848 residents began requesting a post office for the township, and Kinlochewe Post Office opened on 1 November 1850. The post office was located in the Robert Burns Inn on Summerhill Road and Sydney Road. In 1854 it was moved and renamed Donnybrook, then renamed Kalkallo in 1874, before eventually closing in 1971.\nDuring the gold rush years the town boomed as travellers made their way up Sydney Road and the township featured seventeen accommodation houses, a police station, jail and court house. In the 1870s the duplication of the Hume Highway and the opening of the north-east railway decimated the population.\n\nKalkallo is located amongst the large Gilgai plain. Located near Donovans Lane north-west of the town centre, is Bald Hill volcano that last erupted over 1 million years ago. Merri Creek runs through Kalkallo to the east of the township. The Kalkallo Grasslands are remnants of a large area of grassland which houses many threatened species of plants, amphibians and reptiles:\n\n\n\nKalkallo has been a focus of a number of town planning ideas since colonisation, but remains largely undeveloped in 2015, however there are a number of housing developments current being planned and built.\n\nAs part of the publication \"We Must Go On: A Study of Planned Reconstruction and Housing\" Frederick Oswald Barnett along with W.O. Burt and Frank Heath focused on improvement of housing in Australia and Melbourne after World War II. Barnett and Burt played a significant role in the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board and the garden city movement was a central focus proposed to solve the slum problems in Melbourne. Frank Heath was an architect who produced town plans based on garden city principles, and plans for Kalkallo as a garden city are printed in \"We Must Go On\". The book does not detail the motives for these plans, however they were never implemented, and as a result Kalkallo remains a small township.\n\nMelbourne's Urban Growth Boundary was extended to include Kalkallo in 2010. It was designated as part of the Urban Growth Zone in 2012.\n\nUrban sprawl is a divisive topic in Melbourne as it is claimed to ease housing affordability, but can have significant impacts on the environment, as well as social impacts such as isolation due to a lack of transport infrastructure. The\nVictorian State Government has expanded the Urban Growth Boundary several times since 2002 as a result of the Melbourne 2030 plan (later known as Melbourne@5million). Melbourne 2030 introduced the notion of creating a limit on urban expansion. However, since the implementation of Melbourne 2030, the boundary has been extended, which is contradictory to a key objective.

He was elected as a Conservative in St. George's district in 1897, in his second attempt at a seat in the House of Assembly. He was defeated in four subsequent general elections, however, contesting a variety of districts.\n\nWhile a member for St. George's (1887–1900) Gibbs established a reputation as an advocate of trade unionism and as a skilled negotiator on behalf of labour. He was instrumental in launching the Longshoremen's Protective Union (LSPU) in 1903 and remained LSPU counsel until his death.

The summits of the Nebelhorn and Fellhorn provide dramatic panoramic views of the alps. The Nebelhorn can be reached with a big cable car. Visitors can ride a unique diagonal elevator to the top of the Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze.\n\nOberstdorf consists of the village of Oberstdorf (813 metres above sea level, survey point by the Roman Catholic church) and five other villages: \n\nThere is a large number of valleys in the area around Oberstdorf, many of which are not only scenic, but are often starting points for walks in the mountains. The following list shows the main valleys together with their side valleys:\n\n\nOytal and Dietersbachtal are separated by the Höfats and Rauheck. Gerstruben, Germany's highest village, lies at the entrance to the Dietersbachtal.\n\nThe Rappenalptal is the longest and runs from Germany's southernmost village, Einödsbach, past the Haldenwanger Eck, Germany's southernmost point. At the end of the valley the Schrofen Pass leads to Austria.\n\nThe Allgäu Alps in the area around Oberstdorf attain heights of over 2,600 metres and belong to the Northern Limestone Alps. The best known summits in Oberstdorf are:\n\n\nThere are numerous lakes at various heights around Oberstdorf:\n\n\n\nFindings show that the Oberstdorf area was already inhabited from the Stone Age to the Roman Empire. When the Romans had abandoned the area east of the Upper Rhine and north of the Upper Rhine in the 3rd century, various Germanic groups migrated into the area, which were later called Alemanni.\n\nOberstdorf was first mentioned in 1141. King Maximilian, the later emperor, granted Oberstdorf in 1495 the right to hold a market and the High Court. In 1518 Count Hugo of Montfort built a spa in Tiefenbach at the sulphur spring, which is regarded as a precursor of today's spa facility.\nDuring World War II the mountains around the village were used to train mountain troops of the Wehrmacht. At the end of the war French and Mexican troops were stationed there.\n\nIn December, before every New Year, Oberstdorf hosts the first part of the ski jumping Four Hills Tournament on the Schattenberg large hill. There is also a ski flying hill, Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze, about seven kilometres to the south. ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" famously featured the Oberstdorf ski flying hill when Vinko Bogataj fell during his jump in 1970, thus becoming known as \"The Agony of Defeat\".\n\nOberstdorf hosted the Nordic skiing World Championships in 1987 and 2005 and won the bid for the 2021 World Championships. The town has also hosted several stages of the Tour de Ski, a cross-country skiing stage event.\n\nGermany's modern figure skating center was built on the outside of the town. It has three covered rinks and some of them are accessible to the public, for recreational skating. It is a popular destination with European skaters for training camps.\n\nOberstdorf hosts the annual Nebelhorn Trophy figure skating competition and has hosted the German Figure Skating Championships twelve times. It has also hosted the 1982, 2000, and 2007 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. One of the two ISU adult figure skating competitions (for skaters aged 28 and older) is held in Oberstdorf each May.\n\nMountain bikers start their Transalp tour in Oberstdorf on the Schrofen Pass to Riva del Garda.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1918370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918370", "title": "Bamford–Stevens reaction", "text": "Bamford–Stevens reaction\n\nThe Bamford–Stevens reaction is a chemical reaction whereby treatment of tosylhydrazones with strong base gives alkenes. It is named for the British chemist William Randall Bamford and the Scottish chemist Thomas Stevens Stevens (1900–2000). The usage of aprotic solvents gives predominantly Z-alkenes, while protic solvent gives a mixture of E- and Z-alkenes. As an alkene-generating transformation, the Bamford–Stevens reaction has broad utility in synthetic methodology and complex molecule synthesis.\n\nThe treatment of tosylhydrazones with alkyl lithium reagents is called the Shapiro reaction.\n\nThe first step of the Bamford–Stevens reaction is the formation of the diazo compound 3.\n\nIn protic solvents, the diazo compound 3 decomposes to the carbenium ion 5.\nIn aprotic solvents, the diazo compound 3 decomposes to the carbene 7.\nThe Bamford–Stevens reaction has not proved useful for the stereoselective generation of alkenes via thermal decomposition of metallated tosylhydrazones due to the indiscriminate 1,2-rearrangement of the carbene center, which gives a mixture of products. By replacing an alkyl group with a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group on N-aziridinylimines, migration of a specific hydrogen atom can be enhanced. With the silicon atom beta to H, a σ → σ stereoelectronic effect weakens the C-H bond, resulting in its exclusive migration and leading to the nearly exclusive formation of allylsilanes instead of equal amounts of allylsilanes and isomeric homoallylsilanes, analogous to the mixture of products seen in the dialkyl case, or other insertion products (i.e. cyclopropanes). See beta-silicon effect.\n\n\"N\"-tosylhydrazones can be used in a variety of synthetic procedures. Their use with arynes has been used to prepare 3-substituted indazoles via two proposed pathways. The first step is the deprotonation of the hydrazone of diazo compounds using CsF. At this point, the conjugate base could either decompose to give the diazo compound and undergo a [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition with the aryne to give the product, or a [3+2] annulation with aryne which would also give the final product. While strong bases, such as LiOtBu and CsCO are often used in this chemistry, CsF was used to facilitate the in situ generation of arynes from o-(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates. CsF was also thought to be sufficiently basic to deprotonate the N-tosylhydrazone.\n\nBarluenga and coworkers developed the first example of using N-tosylhydrazones as nucleophilic partners in cross-coupling reactions. Typically, nucleophilic reagents in coupling reactions tend to be of the organometallic variety, namely organomagnesium, -zinc, -tin, -silicon, and –boron. Combined with electrophilic aryl halides, N-tosylhydrazones can be used to prepare polysubstituted olefins under Pd-catalyzed conditions without the use of often expensive, and synthetically demanding organometallic reagents.\nThe scope of the reaction is wide; N-tosylhydrazones derived from aldehydes and ketones are well tolerated, which leads to both di- and trisubstituted olefins. Moreover, and variety of aryl halides are well tolerated as coupling partners including those bearing both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, as well as π-rich and π-deficient aromatic heterocyclic compounds. Stereochemistry is an important element to consider when preparing polysubstituted olefins. Using hydrazones derived from linear aldehydes resulted in exclusively trans olefins, while the stereochemical outcomes of trisubstituted olefins were dependent on the size of the substituents.\n\nThe mechanism of this transformation is thought to proceed in a manner similar to the synthesis of alkenes through the Bamford–Stevens reaction; the decomposition of N-tosylhydrazones in the presence of base to generate diazocompounds which then release nitrogen gas, yielding a carbene, which then can be quenched with an electrophile. In this case, the coupling reaction starts with the oxidative addition of the aryl halide to Pd catalyst to give the aryl Pd complex. The reaction of the diazocompound, generated from the hydrazone, with the Pd complex produces a Pd-carbene complex. A migratory insertion of the aryl group gives an alkyl Pd complex, which undergoes syn beta-hydride elimination to generate the trans aryl olefin and regenerate the Pd catalyst. This reaction has also seen utility in preparing conjugated enynes from N-tosylhydrazones and terminal alkynes under similar Pd-catalyzed reaction conditions and following the same mechanism.\n\nMoreover, Barluenga and coworkers demonstrated a one-pot three-component coupling reaction of aldehydes or ketones, tosylhydrazides, and aryl halides in which the \"N\"-tosylhydrazone is formed in situ. This process produces stereoselective olefins in similar yields compared to the process in which preformed \"N\"-tosylhydrazones are used.\n\nBarluenga and coworkers also developed metal-free reductive coupling methodology of N-tosylhydrazones with boronic acids. The reaction tolerates a variety of functional groups on both substrates, including aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents, and proceeds with high yields in the presence of potassium carbonate. The reaction is thought to proceed through the formation of a diazo compound that is generated from a hydrazone salt. The diazo compound could then react with the boronic acid to produce the benzylboronic acid through a boronate intermediate. An alternate pathway consists of the formation of the benzylboronic acid via a zwitterionic intermediate, followed by protodeboronation of the benzylboronic acid under basic conditions, which results in the final reductive product. \nThis methodology has also been extended to heteroatom nucleophiles to produce ethers and thioethers.\n\nA novel process was developed by Stoltz in which the Bamford–Stevens reaction was combined with the Claisen rearrangement to produce a variety of olefin products. This transformation proceeds first by the thermal decomposition of N-aziridinylhydrazones to form the diazo compound (1), followed by a rhodium-mediated de-diazotization (2) and the syn 1,2-hydride shift (3). This substrate undergoes a thermal aliphatic Claisen rearrangement (4) to yield the product.\n\nTrost et al. utilized the Bamford–Stevens reaction in their total synthesis of (–)-isoclavukerin to introduce a diene moiety found in the natural product. A bicyclic trisylhydrazone was initially subjected to Shapiro reaction conditions (alkyllithiums or LDA), which only led to uncharacterizable decomposition products. When this bicyclic trisylhydrazone was subjected to strong base (KH) and heat, however, the desired diene product was generated. Moreover, it was shown that olefin generation and the following decarboxylation could be performed in one pot. To that end, excess NaI was added, along with an elevation in temperature to facilitate the Krapcho decarboxylation.\n"}

Synthetic aperture sonars combine a number of acoustic pings to form an image with much higher along-track resolution than conventional sonars. The along-track resolution can approach half the length of one sonar element, though is downward limited by 1/4 wavelength. The principle of synthetic aperture sonar is to move the sonar while illuminating the same spot on the sea floor with several pings. When moving along a straight line, those pings that have the image position within the beamwidth constitutes the synthetic array. By coherent reorganization of the data from all the pings, a synthetic aperture image is produced with improved along-track resolution. In contrast to conventional side-scan sonar, SAS processing provides range-independent along-track resolution. At maximum range the resolution can be magnitudes better than that of side-scan sonars.\n\nA 2013 technology review with examples and future trends is also available.

Hilton began his professional career in music in 2000. \"Rolling Stone magazine\" compared him to his contemporary, Howie Day, while others have compared Hilton to Elton John, both vocally and instrumentally.\n\nSince the release of his debut album, Hilton has ventured into acting, guest starring on The CW's \"One Tree Hill\" as the talented but somewhat arrogant Chris Keller, and playing the role of Elvis Presley in the Johnny Cash biopic \"Walk the Line\". He also appeared in Taylor Swift's music video \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" and Gloriana's music video \"(Kissed You) Good Night\".\n\nHilton was born in Palm Springs, California, the son of Kristy (née Herren) and Robert George Hilton. Raised in Bermuda Dunes, California, Hilton grew up around music and began teaching himself Elvis Presley songs at an early age. After a brief stint in Northern California, his family moved back to the Palm Springs area, where he wrote his first song about a girl named Rhian with whom he attended school. Hilton's family made another move back to Coachella Valley for high school, where, at La Quinta High School, he started a band with some of his classmates. The band did not go anywhere, so Hilton began to enter open mic nights and went to local coffee shops to play his own music.\n\nHilton lives in Los Angeles. He got engaged to actress Megan Park, whom he met on the set of \"Charlie Bartlett\", in December 2013; and married on October 10, 2015. In 2020, they welcomed a daughter, Winnie.\n\nHilton heard a local radio station was giving away Jonny Lang concert tickets and called into The Mark & Brian radio show on KLOS in Los Angeles at the age of 16. While on the phone, he sang an a cappella version of Jonny Lang’s song \"Breakin' Me\". Mark & Brian were so impressed with Hilton's performance that they gave him a spot at the station's Christmas concert. Word of Hilton caught the ear of Maverick Records (owned by Warner Bros. Records), who signed him up with a record deal when he was 18. Hilton released a self-titled EP on April 6, 2004. All four songs were included on his first album \"The Tracks of Tyler Hilton\" released on September 28, 2004. After the release of his album, Hilton joined the likes of Avril Lavigne, Jet, 50 Cent, and Josh Groban as an artist chosen by AOL Breaker for his star potential.\n\nIn addition to his own albums, Hilton has also appeared on each of the three different \"One Tree Hill\" soundtrack albums, some with formerly unreleased material that cannot be found anywhere else. Most notably, the cover of the Ryan Adams song \"When the Stars Go Blue\", which was arranged into a duet with One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Lenz for the show; also, a cover of \"Missing You\" by John Waite and the original track \"You'll Ask For Me\". In 2005, he was part of a 23-city concert tour along with Lenz, The Wreckers and Gavin Degraw. During the summer of that year, he opened for Hilary Duff on her \"Still Most Wanted Tour\".\n\nHis EP, \"Better on Beachwood\", which features three songs was released in May 2009. \"Ladies & Gentlemen\", another EP followed in April 2010 and features five songs. Both EPs are available on iTunes.\n\nFor five years, Hilton worked on an album called \"The Storms We Share\". The album, containing some songs of \"Ladies & Gentlemen\", was planned to be released in the late summer of 2010. However, when the direction changed at Warner Bros. Records, Hilton left the label resulting in the material not being released.\nOn June 27, 2011, Tyler Hilton's song \"Faithful\" was released on the soundtrack of \"Larry Crowne\".\n\nOn January 11, 2012, Hilton released a free song called \"Loaded Gun\" from his upcoming album \"Forget the Storm\" on his website and was featured in the season 9 premiere episode of \"One Tree Hill\" following his return as Chris Keller. Hilton also debuted two songs from the album called \"Kicking My Heels\" and \"Prince of Nothing Charming\" on the show. On February 14, 2012, \"Prince of Nothing Charming\", the first single from Hilton's upcoming album \"Forget the Storm,\" was made available on iTunes. On March 7, 2012, Hilton revealed via Twitter that \"Forget The Storm\", his first full-length LP since 2004, would be released on April 3, 2012. The album was produced by David Hodges among others and released through Hilton's own label, Hooptie Tune Records. He chose to title it \"Forget the Storm\" as a reference to his unreleased album, \"The Storms We Share,\" and described it as \"a little more rock and roll.\" Hilton began a tour in the United States with Dion Roy and \"Dakota and Will\" in March 2012 which ended mid June 2012. He also toured with Boyce Avenue in the UK and Ireland in June 2012 until July 2012 and will return late October 2012 on his own headlining tour after more US shows, wrapping up the year with shows back in the US. On December 7, 2016 Hilton release a new single called \"Next To You\" on iTunes; It was recorded on his Forget The Storm Deluxe Version as an acoustic version.\n\nIn 2017, Tyler Hilton released his cover of \"Stay\" by Rihanna and released his most recent single \"Overtime\" on August 15, 2017.\n\nAfter his stint as Chris Keller on \"One Tree Hill\", Hilton went on to appear in the Academy Award-winning film \"Walk the Line\" as a young Elvis Presley. For the part, Hilton was given the opportunity to cover two Elvis songs for the film: \"Milk Cow Blues\" and \"That's All Right\". Both songs are featured on the film's award-winning soundtrack.\n\nIn 2007, Hilton played the love interest in country music artist Taylor Swift's music video for her song \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" and appeared in the 2008 film \"Charlie Bartlett\". He was with \"Charlie Bartlett\" co-star and now wife Megan Park in the music video for the band Gloriana's song \"(Kissed You) Good Night\" released in January 2012.\n\nHilton also performed in a Season 4 episode of \"My Super Sweet Sixteen\" (Amberly) during a young girl's sweet 16 party. He also appeared on VH1's \"Single Ladies\".\n\nAfter a five-year break from \"One Tree Hill\", Hilton returned as a regular for its ninth and final season.\n\nIn 2016, Hilton played Noah Casey, a billionaire love interest for the main character in \"Pitch\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1918404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918404", "title": "Lorenzo de Zavala", "text": "Lorenzo de Zavala\n\nManuel Lorenzo Justiniano de Zavala y Sanchez (October 14, 1788 – November 15, 1836), known simply as Lorenzo de Zavala, was a Mexican and later Tejano physician, politician, diplomat and author. Born in Yucatán under Spanish rule, he was closely involved in drafting the constitution for the First Federal Republic of Mexico in 1824 after Mexico won independence from Spain. Years later, through a remarkable series of events, he also helped in drafting a constitution for Mexico's rebellious enemy at the time, the Republic of Texas, to secure independence from Mexico in 1836. Zavala was said to have had a keen intellect and was fluent in multiple languages.\n\nSince his youth, Zavala was an indefatigable believer in the principle of democratic representative government. As a young man he founded several newspapers and wrote extensively, espousing democratic reforms — writings which led to his imprisonment by the Spanish crown. While imprisoned, he learned English and studied medicine; after his release, he practiced medicine for two years before entering politics.\n\nOver his career, he served in many different capacities including the Spanish Cortes (legislature) in Madrid representing Yucatán, and in Mexico's Senate. He became Mexico's Minister of Finance and served as Ambassador to France and Governor of the State of Mexico. In 1829, when the Mexican government was overthrown, Zavala was forced into exile and moved to the United States for two years. He wrote a book about U.S. political culture during this time and also traveled extensively in Europe. With his diplomatic experience and linguistic skills, Zavala was well received by foreign governments.\n\nAfter exile, he returned to Mexico and was appointed as Minister to France. While serving in Paris, Zavala saw that Mexican President Santa Anna was becoming a military-backed dictator, ignoring the Mexican Constitution that Zavala had helped write. Zavala resigned his position in protest and spoke out against Santa Anna. After this schism, Zavala could not return home and fled to Texas, then a Mexican territory, where he owned land. He eventually became an advocate of Texas independence to the point of helping in the drafting of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, personally designing its flag, and serving as Vice President.\n\nSome Mexicans consider Zavala a traitor to his homeland for supporting Texas independence, while Texans consider him a founding father and state hero. In modern-day Texas, both a county and a city are named in his honor, as well as many schools and public buildings including the Texas State Archives and Library Building in Austin.\n\nZavala was born on October 3, 1788, in the town of Tecoh, Yucatán, Zavala's parents were \"criollos\", Spanish Basques born in Mexico. Zavala was a third-generation Yucatecan. His grandfather moved to the Yucatán peninsula from Peru. Zavala's father, born in 1725, was a notary— a legal representative in Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nZavala was educated in Mérida, Yucatán's provincial capital, in the Tridentine Seminary of San Ildefonso. There he studied the standard curriculum of Latin, morals, scholastic theology, and classical philosophy. After graduation, he founded a newspaper called \"The Universal Critic\" (\"El Aristarco Universal\") and wrote for several newspapers in which he espoused democratic ideas that would remain the pillars of his later political career. His writings were critical of the Spanish officials, and he was imprisoned at age 26 for three years by the Spanish Crown (1814-1817). While incarcerated, Zavala learned the English language and studied medical textbooks to an extent that qualified him to practice medicine upon his release. He practiced medicine for two years, then political events compelled him to return to politics.\n\nZavala began his political career becoming secretary of the local government of his home state of Yucatán, which created opportunities leading to his later election to the Cortes (legislature) in Madrid representing Yucatán as its governor. After México won independence from Spain in 1821, Zavala resigned his position in Madrid and returned to Mexico, where he was elected to the newly formed national congress, again representing Yucatán. Zavala became part of a group to draft the constitution of the Federal Republic of Mexico. In 1824, he was elected as President of the Constituent Congress and was the first to sign the Mexican Federal Constitution of 1824. He served in the Mexican Senate from 1824 to 1826. He was appointed Minister of Finance in 1829, but served only 6 months before the government was overthrown and Zavala was placed under house arrest. He fled to the United States entering a self-imposed exile.\n\nDuring his exile Zavala, ever the scholar, wrote a book called \"Journey to the United States of North America\", a travel narrative similar to Alexis de Tocqueville's \"Democracy in America\", although Zavala's book preceded de Tocqueville's work by a year. Zavala traveled in the northeast U.S. and wrote about U.S. political system and culture from a Mexican point of view. The book was mainly a panegyric, but did point out the hypocrisy of the U.S. for allowing slavery despite professing lofty ideals of freedom. His other notable writing was a two-volume history of Mexico, entitled \"Historical essay of the Revolutions of Mexico from 1808 to 1830\" (\"Ensayo Histórico de las Revoluciones de México de 1808 hasta 1830\"). He lived in New York, but spent several months in England and France. Zavala's keen mind and his command of Spanish, English, French made him popular abroad. He was made a member of the Geographical and Scientific Society of France and was a received by the Court of St. James's in England.\n\nHis exile ended in 1832 when he returned to Mexico to serve as governor of the State of México, located just west of Mexico City. (It is one of 32 individual states in Mexico and does not refer to the entire country). He was appointed as Minister to France by then President Antonio Lopez Santa Anna. While serving in this capacity in Paris, Zavala became increasingly aware that President Santa Anna, backed by military force and the clergy, was assuming dictatorial powers and was not observing the Mexican Constitution of 1824 that Zavala had helped create. In protest, Zavala resigned his post in France and renounced Santa Anna, who then ordered Zavala to return to Mexico City. Zavala, for his own safety, moved his family to Texas where he owned land.\n\nHe arrived in Texas in 1835 by steamboat near the mouth of the Brazos River and briefly shared a house with his good friend Stephen F. Austin who would later be called \"the Father of Texas\". Other than Austin, the only other Texan he knew before arriving was David G. Burnet who later became Interim President of Texas. Zavala had known Burnet in New York. Both men had been given \"Empresario Grants\" in prior years. These grants were designed by the Mexican Government to encourage new settlers to come to Texas from around the world, the hope being to create a buffer zone between Mexico and the U.S. and also to help deal with the hostile Indians in the region. The owner of a grant was given immense tracts of Texas land in exchange for recruiting and being responsible for a certain quota of new settlers— in Zavala's case, 500 families. Zavala and Burnet had sold their grants to groups of investors in New York.\n\nThe previous summer, Zavala had bought a home on 177 acres (equal to one \"labor\", a Spanish term of land measurement) north of Buffalo Bayou in Harris County, called Zavala Point. This border area contained many immigrants from the United States who were accustomed to a democratic government and individual rights. Animosity against Santa Anna's rule was common and rebellion was brewing. Santa Anna was angered by what he perceived to be U.S. interference in Mexican affairs, and set about to stop the rebellion by dispatching troops.\n\nAt this point, Zavala's hope was to overthrow the existing Mexican government and restore Mexico to a democracy and to have Texas be one of the Mexican states. Before long, he realized that this was not going to happen. A pragmatic realist, he gradually changed his viewpoint and began advocating for Texas independence from Mexico. Despite orders from Santa Anna for Zavala to be captured and deported from Texas, Zavala was never in real danger — he had become a valuable ally with influential Texans seeking independence. His legislative experience, linguistic skills, and diplomatic experience made him ideally suited for drafting the new Constitution of the Republic of Texas, not to mention that he was the only one among them with actual experience in drafting a such a document.\n\nIn March 1836, a meeting of delegates was held in a Texas settlement known as \"Washington-on-the-Brazos\" where the Declaration of Independence for the Republic of Texas was drafted and signed. Zavala personally designed the flag of the new republic, helped write the new constitution, and served as Vice President under the provisional government. While working, the delegates received a message that the Alamo was under siege. After the Alamo fell, Santa Anna's forces were soon advancing on the delegation, forcing them to flee. When Santa Anna's troops approached Zavala's Point, Zavala and his family fled down the San Jacinto River to the home of William Scott, one of the \"Empressario\" Grant colonists. A number of families awaited there for a steamer to take them to safety on Galveston Island. Nearby, in Harris County, Santa Anna's army faced Texas General Sam Houston's forces on April 21, 1836 at the Battle of San Jacinto. Santa Anna was defeated and captured.\n\nA few months after this, Zavala's health began to fail. He resigned his office of Vice President and returned home. Less than a month after his resignation, he was boating in Buffalo Bayou when his rowboat overturned and he was chilled. Zavala developed pneumonia and died at his home on November 15, 1836. He was buried in a small cemetery plot at his home. The grave was later moved to the San Jacinto Battleground Park.\n\nMexican historians are generally respectful to Zavala for his efforts to create a republic and for improving conditions for the lower class; however, Zavala's apparent reversal of loyalty to his native Mexico and his turning to participate in Texas Independence branded him as a traitor to many Mexicans, a feeling some harbor to this day.\n\nIn 1807 Zavala married Teresa Correa y Corres. They had three children: a son named Lorenzo Jr., a daughter named Manuela, and a daughter who died at age one. Zavala's wife, Teresa, died in the spring of 1831. Zavala remarried while in exile. He married Emily West in New York on November 12, 1831, at the Church of the Transfiguration. To this union was born a son and two daughters. The son Augustine, the eldest, was the father of Adina Emilia de Zavala, who played a role in the fight to preserve the Alamo as a historic structure for future generations.\n\nZavala and his friends secretly organized the first Masonic Lodge in Yucatán, the Reunión a la Virtud lodge No. 9. The lodge received its charter from the Louisiana Grand Lodge in 1817. It was Zavala's relationship with his fellow masonic brothers and to other lodges that allowed him to gather many political connections prior to Mexico's Independence.\nZavala was one of the key people that helped establish the York Rite Masonry in Mexico in 1826 as an alternative to the older, well established Scottish rite (Escocés). That same year the Grand Lodge of New York issued charters to five Masonic Lodges in Mexico City. These five lodges became the nucleus of the movement that favored decentralization of leadership. Zavala became the Charter Master of Independencia Lodge No. 454. He kept his position until his exile in 1830. He is listed as a \"Masonic Hero\" by the Grand Lodge of Texas.\nSome sources state that Zavala was disgraced for revealing ritual secrets.\n\nThe town of Zavala, Texas was named for him in Jasper County in 1834. The town no longer exists, but there is a village about 20 miles away in Angelina County named Zavalla (spelled differently) which is also named for Lorenzo de Zavala. In 1858, 22 years after Zavala's death, the Texas Legislature named Zavala County in his honor. Zavala County is in southern Texas, and sits roughly in a triangle formed by Del Rio, Laredo, and San Antonio. The county seat is Crystal City. Unfortunately, when the name was given, it was misspelled as \"Zavalla\" and the error was not officially corrected until 71 years later (1929). Currently, his name appears on many public buildings and schools, including the Texas State Library and Archives Commission in Austin. The National Hispanic Institute named its Lorenzo de Zavala Youth Legislative Session program (colloquially known as the \"LDZ,\" now hosted at five universities across the U.S. and one in Panama) for him.\n\n\n"}

It was picked up by various European cable television networks.\n\nLaunched on 30 January 1987, replacing 24-hour music channel Music Box, Super Channel was co-owned by all but one of the ITV companies at the time in the United Kingdom. Virgin Group had a majority stake in Music Box (60%) and would own 15% of the equity with the rest being split between ITV franchise holders including Granada, Yorkshire, LWT, Central, Anglia, Tyne Tees, Ulster, Grampian, Scottish, and Border Television. Thames Television was the only one of the ITV contractors not to participate. It competed with Sky Channel, forerunner of Sky1, which was the only other major pan-European satellite-channel around at the time. Unlike Sky Channel, Super Channel's syndicated output was less American and more European. Many of the programmes were what it called the \"Best of British\", sourced from ITV or the BBC, while ITN produced news bulletins (\"see also ITN World News\"). It also broadcast syndicated non-British European programmes such as the Dutch sitcom \"Zeg 'ns Aaa\" (with English subtitles).\n\nSuper Channel fared poorly, due to UK programming seen as unsuitable for European audiences, such as drama being seen as \"too violent\" or \"too realistic\", as well as a dispute with the British actors unions who demanded additional fees for viewing by European audiences which meant that it could no longer offer the 'Best of British to a European audience'.\n\nWithin a year, the ITV companies sold the channel to the Italian Marcucci family, owners of Videomusic, the first music channel in Italy, with a minority stake being held by Richard Branson's Virgin plc, and the programming changed from British to pan-European, although it continued carrying ITN's World News bulletins.\n\nAt the beginning Super Channel was based in the heart of London, 19-22 Rathbone Place, London W1P 1DF, in the same building as Music Box; the building would later become the home of CNN International until 2007. For a number of months the channel's transmission facilities were provided by Molinare at Fouberts Place, London W1, it returned briefly to 19-22 Rathbone Place until the Marcucci family acquired Melrose House, 14 Lanark Square, in Limeharbour (London) where it set up a state of the art transmission facility.\n\nIn 1996 the channel (along with its sister channel CNBC Europe) was transmitted from the GE building in Hammersmith, London. The transmission suite used cutting edge (at the time) Pro-Bel COMPASS and MAPP automation, and Profile video servers for all commercials and promotions. Programmes continued to be played from tape, however.\n\nIn 1993, the station was having financial difficulties, and was taken over by the American company General Electric, then-parent of the NBC television network, and became NBC Super Channel. In 1996, the channel was renamed NBC Europe, but was, from then on, almost always referred to as simply \"NBC\" on the air.\n\nMost of NBC Europe's prime time programming was produced in Europe, but after 10 pm Central European Time on weekday evenings, the channel aired \"The Tonight Show\", \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", and \"Later\", hence its slogan \"Where the Stars Come Out at Night.\" Most NBC News programs were broadcast on NBC Europe, including \"Dateline NBC\", \"Time and Again\" and \"NBC Nightly News\", which was aired live. \"The Today Show\" was also initially shown live in the afternoons, but was later broadcast the following morning instead, by which time it was more than half a day old. That meant that all news portions had to be replaced with European updates produced by ITN in London. ITN also supplied the network with the main European newscasts before and after the GE takeover. The European weather was produced by the BBC at first, but was later taken over by NBC in the U.S.\n\nNBC Europe carried virtually no prime time fiction entertainment programs shown on NBC in the US, because they were usually owned and distributed by other studios under the fin-syn rules (which did not apply in Europe). NBC would have had to buy the rights for each country in order to show them on NBC Europe, which would have been too expensive. Even for shows that NBC Studios owned itself, it was generally more financially viable to sell the rights country by country either to broadcast or cable/satellite channels than to air them on NBC Europe. The most notable exceptions to this rule were brief runs of \"Profiler\" and \"The Pretender\", as well as short-lived US sitcoms \"Union Square\" and \"Mr. Rhodes\". That is widely considered to be one of the main reasons why NBC Europe was ultimately not a success.\n\nNBC Europe stopped broadcasting to most of Europe in 1998, when the DFA (Deutsche Fernsehnachrichten Agentur) took it over and moved it to Düsseldorf. Most of the satellite feeds of NBC Europe became either National Geographic or CNBC. NBC Europe continued to operate on the German cable TV, fed by one digital satellite link from Eutelsat II-F1 (later Hotbird 5). In November 1998 the first German programming started airing. Programming was assembled with content from GIGA and CNBC Europe, as well as other shows. In 2004, NBC Universal took over the DFA and consequently NBC Europe.\n\nOn 29 September 2005 NBC Europe was split into GIGA and the new channel Das Vierte. NBC Europe was replaced by Das Vierte. In fact Das Vierte is still broadcasting with the licence of NBC Europe on cable TV; on satellite, IPTV and digital cable it is a new channel. Das Vierte broadcasts a special version on cable TV, including CNBC Europe, and from 29 September 2005 to 31 March 2006, also GIGA. This is necessary to keep the licence and the cable channel.\n\nDue to limitations on the amount of entertainment programming on the network, \"NBC Europe\" aired a number of original programming in tandem with American programming that had not been aired in Europe beforehand. These programmes include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1918423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918423", "title": "Raton Pass", "text": "Raton Pass\n\nRatón Pass is a 7,834 ft (2,388 m) elevation mountain pass on the Colorado-New Mexico border in the western United States. \"Ratón\" is Spanish for \"mouse\". It is located on the eastern side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains between Trinidad, Colorado and Raton, New Mexico, approximately 180 miles (290 km) northeast of Santa Fe. The pass crosses the line of volcanic mesas that extends east from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains along the state line, and furnishes the most direct land route between the valley of the Arkansas River to the north and the upper valley of the Canadian River, leading towards Santa Fe, to the south. The pass now carries Interstate 25 and railroad tracks.\n\nThe pass is a historically significant landmark on the Santa Fe Trail, a major 19th-century settlement route between Kansas City, Missouri and Santa Fe. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for this association.\n\nIn 1821, Captain William Becknell laid the path of the Santa Fe Trail through the pass. In 1846 during the Mexican–American War, Stephen W. Kearny and his troops passed through the pass en route to New Mexico. During the Civil War, it was the primary path into New Mexico since it avoided Confederate raiders. It was later developed into a toll road by Richens Lacey Wootton.\n\nIn the late 19th century, it was used by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway as the railroad's primary route through the mountains. Along with the Royal Gorge in Colorado the pass was one of the focal points for the 1878–1879 Railroad Wars between the AT&SF and the smaller Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. The route over the pass required gradients of up to 3.5%, with a tunnel at the highest point of the AT&SF, at 7588 feet above sea level. The tunnel is entirely within New Mexico, with its northern portal only a few feet south of the Colorado border.\n\nBNSF Railway, which absorbed the Santa Fe railroad in 1996, and Amtrak continue to use this route. However, following completion of the Belen Cutoff in 1908, the majority of freight traffic was diverted over the Cutoff, which has gradients of no more than 1.25%. Amtrak's Southwest Chief passenger service between Chicago and Los Angeles, continues to use Raton Pass (one train daily in each direction). In 2012, there was not enough freight traffic for BNSF to maintain the line up to the standards required by Amtrak for continued intercity service. This problem has placed the future of rail transportation over Raton Pass in jeopardy. BNSF operates little to no revenue freight service over the pass between La Junta, Colorado, and Lamy, New Mexico, leaving Amtrak's Southwest Chief as the only daily revenue train to occupy the route.\n\nIn the 20th century the Pass became the route of U.S. Route 85 and later Interstate 25 between Denver and Albuquerque.

Southland has a floor area of 129,180m², making it one of the biggest shopping centres in Australia by size. There are approximately 400 retailers in Southland, including Myer, David Jones and Harris Scarfe. According to the Melbourne 2030 Metropolitan Strategy, Southland is recognised as one of 26 Principal Activity Centres. The centre is also one of the most profitable shopping centres in Australia, with an annual turnover of $857.9-million recorded in 2016.\n\nSouthland shopping centre was designed by Melbourne architects Tomkins, Shaw & Evans, who had previously designed Westfield Miranda (then Miranda Fair) in 1964. At the time of its opening, in September 1968, Southland was one of the premier shopping centres in Melbourne. It was, by modern standards, a relatively small shopping centre with only a handful of large stores, including a Myer department store and a Safeway supermarket, plus a few dozen other smaller retailers, banks and cafes. An unusual feature was a roof garden with lawns, shrubs and trees. Another notable design feature were wall murals in the hallways leading in from the entrances that featured original abstract art-work on ceramic tiles. Architectural photographer Wolfgang Sievers took a series of striking images of the building soon after it opened and these are now held by the National Library of Australia.\n\nArchitects Tomkins, Shaw & Evans received the Victoria Award in 1969 for their design of Southland, beating the National Gallery of Victoria for the award. This was during a period when shopping centres were recognised \"for the quality of their design or amenity\". Prior to the mid–1980s Southland was owned by the Myer Emporium, and the centre would not rival the nearby Chadstone Shopping Centre in size, until the Westfield Group took over management.\n\nDuring Southland's history, many renovations and face-lifts have shaped the centre, such as the first expansion in 1987 and the development of a Village Cinemas complex and food court in 1990. The rooftop garden was removed upon first redevelopment and was replaced with a third level of stores.\n\nPrior to the extension, the 70,000m² Southland shopping centre had very limited development options. In June 1991, Westfield developers began discussions with the City of Moorabbin about the rezoning of the 60,000 m² Cheltenham market area in order for them to construct a multimillion-dollar extension of Southland as part of a major redevelopment. The original plan was to have replaced the market with a 10-storey office tower and a two-level shopping centre, with a retail bridge connecting the new centre with the existing Westfield Centre over the eight-lane Nepean Highway. The new centre would feature a discount supermarket and a regular supermarket as well as new speciality stores. All up, the whole centre would comprise up to 360 stores. In June 1993, planning approval was given by the Minister for Planning Rob Maclellan.\n\nIn December 1996, plans were changed in favour of better car park arrangements as well as easier access to the centre. The centre would soon feature more than 400 stores across three levels.\n\nIn November 1997, demolition commenced at the Cheltenham market site. In March 1998, the first concrete was poured by the Premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett. The two sites were to be linked by a bridge with shops on it. The former cinemas and food court were demolished, and the wide, multi-level retail-pedestrian-vehicle bridge (largest of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere) was added. During this time, the Myer anchor moved from the original site to the newer site. Construction was not just limited to the new site with the original site being upgraded to include a new larger cinema complex, in the youth-oriented mall called The Street.\n\nThe redevelopment was opened in stages, with The Street opening in April 1999. The main part of the redevelopment, the additional site and bridge were opened on 28 October 1999. The $300 million redevelopment was completed on 5 May 2000, with the opening of the David Jones Department store.\n\nSubsequently, another $13 million was used for additional work, which included construction of shaded car park areas, two new car park ramps as well as a large glass window attached to the second level of the retail bridge, which has views 16 kilometres in the distance of the Melbourne CBD.\n\nFrom 2002, the Victorian State Government has designated Southland as one of 26 Principal Activity Centres in the city, as described in the Melbourne 2030 Metropolitan Strategy. \n\nA focal point of the activity centre has been public transport; a 2002 planning report found gaps in Melbourne's transit pertaining to Southland, particularly its lack of transport accessibility. In 2013, Public Transport Victoria (PTV) released its 20-year Network Development Plan; the report found that a railway station at Southland would need to be built within the next five years, as to improve Melbourne's transport system. In 2015, the Victorian Government committed to building a railway station at Southland to serve the busy shopping centre. Construction on Southland railway station commenced in 2016 and it was completed and opened in November 2017.\n\nWestfield Southland features up to 400 stores including 2 department stores, 4 discount department stores, 3 supermarkets, 3 electrical (computers, television etc.) retailers and a 16 screen Village Cinemas Multiplex (cinema). The centre recorded an annual turnover of $857.9-million in 2016, according to Scentre Group. \n\nA large number of scenes for the Seven Network comedy \"Kath & Kim\" were filmed at Southland. In the programme the centre is designated as Fountain Lakes, where some of the shopping scenes are also filmed. The centre is also featured in multiple episodes of the ABC2 television drama-comedy series \"Please Like Me\".\n\n"}

Crazy Ron’s entered into voluntary administration after declaring insolvency in early April 2005 after a long and costly David and Goliath legal battle with a national multi-million competitor, Crazy John's.\n\nIn 2013, Bakir was awarded the Gold Coast Young Entrepreneur of the Year due to his success with HomeCorp.\n\nIn 2015 Ron was nominated for the prestigious Executive of the Year Awards held by the CEO Magazine. In the same year Bakir was also one of the four finalists in the Construction Executive of the Year for his achievements in the property industry.\n\nBakir founded HomeCorp Property Group in 2004. HomeCorp is a private urban development company headquartered on the Gold Coast, Queensland. HomeCorp began as a company delivering small home and land projects to Australian property investors and has grown to achieve over $1 billion in accumulated sales since 2004 across more than 15 projects. The company has been considered successful, despite Australia property development slowing down during the Financial crisis of 2007–08, with Bakir attributing the constant growth to HomeCorp's extensive market research. HomeCorp has delivered projects in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Queensland.\n\nBakir was awarded the Gold Coast Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2013 for his leadership of the HomeCorp Property Group. The awards are judged by Business News Publications and aim to recognise young business owners operating in the Gold Coast region aged 40 or under.\n\nIn 2013, the Rockhampton Regional Council approved plans for 950 residential lots in the community currently known as the ‘Pineapple Patch', with HomeCorp announcing a $500 million project in the location. In 2014 HomeCorp started its construction division HomeCorp Constructions.\n\nIn 2016 HomeCorp entered into a partnership with the internationally renowned Queensland- based developer Sunland Group to deliver 700 homes in Australia’s fastest growing region the Gold Coast northern corridor. In 2017 HomeCorp was named in Westpac Bank’s 200 Businesses of Tomorrow leadership list.”\n\nAs at 2017 HomeCorp Constructions was Queensland’s 11th largest building construction company as listed in the HIA top 100 construction data report.\n\nIn 2005, Bakir donated an undisclosed sum of money to the legal defence of Schapelle Corby. \n\nBakir retained the services of the Australian law firm Hoolihans to \"Investigate the claim and gather evidence, provide advice in respect of the claim, attend to all procedures necessary for the disclosure by Australian or other bodies of information relevant to the defence, including attendance at conferences with representatives of such bodies, appearing before the media or presenting press releases which may assist the matter, issue Court proceedings if necessary, assist in attending to all pre-trial preparation, engage counsel and other experts, attend at trial as necessary and attend to all such other matters as required.\" \n\nBakir claims to have no relationship to Corby other than being from the same city. He reportedly decided to help fund Corby's defence because he believed that a miscarriage of justice could occur if she were not properly represented. He pledged A$100,000 towards the A$1,000,000 reward fund, but the full reward was never raised.\n\nBefore the prosecution announced their sentencing recommendation, Bakir accused the prosecution team (chief prosecutor Ida Bagus Wiswantanu) of seeking a bribe to reduce the requested sentence. The prosecution team and the Indonesian government vehemently denied that this had occurred. Bakir quickly issued a written apology to Indonesian authorities for his statements.\n\nAfter her sentencing, Corby sacked her main Indonesian defence lawyer, Lily Lubis, and Indonesian case co-ordinator Vasu Rasiah in July 2005, when Australian lawyer Mark Trowell QC told the media that Rasiah had asked him to request A$500,000 from the Australian government, money meant to bribe the judges of the appeal court.\n\nBakir registered a company titled Schapelle Corby Pty Ltd, stating that he wanted to protect her name from people who wanted to exploit it. Some raised doubts as to his motives, although Schapelle's cousin, Melissa Younger, told the media that his support was genuine. \n\nIn June 2005, Bakir formally ended his involvement in Schapelle's defence, stating that he had done everything in his power to help her, including contributing more than $200,000 to her campaign. By 22 July 2005, Bakir had deregistered both Schapelle Corby Pty Ltd and the schapellecorby.com.au website.\n\nBakir is known for his philanthropy having donated hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years to the disadvantaged and various charity organisations. In 2016 he donated more than $100,000.00 to the Big Plates Little Mates Cancer Foundation; $20,000.00 to the MS Foundation; and $25,000 to the Salvation Army. In 2017 he donated almost $100,000 to the Gold Coast Community Fund.\n\n"}

Those who are dying may lose their ability to swallow and may have increased production of bronchial secretions, resulting in such an accumulation. Usually, two or three days earlier, the symptoms of approaching death can be observed as saliva accumulates in the throat, making it very difficult to take even a spoonful of water. Related symptoms can include shortness of breath and rapid chest movement. While death rattle is a strong indication that someone is near death, it can also be produced by other problems that cause interference with the swallowing reflex, such as brain injuries.\n\nIt is sometimes misinterpreted as the sound of the person choking to death or gargling. \n\nThis symptom most commonly appears sometime during the last 24 hours of the person's life, although some people live somewhat longer.\n\nThe dying person is usually unaware of the noisy breathing and is not disturbed by it, but some healthcare providers attempt to minimize the sound for the emotional comfort of family members and caregivers. This may be done through repositioning the person, reducing the volume of IV fluids being given, or giving anticholinergic drugs to reduce secretions. In hospice and palliative care, drugs such as glycopyrronium, hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine) or atropine may be used for their anticholinergic effects to reduce secretions and minimize this effect.\n\n\n"}

For most of its length, SR 25 runs through the center of San Benito County.\n\nSR 25 (also known as Bolsa Road and the Airline Highway) begins at the intersection of Peach Tree Road and State Route 198 about 11 miles west of Priest Valley, in Monterey County, and is the northern extension of Peach Tree Road. It heads northwest, crossing into San Benito County and passing through the community of Bitterwater. SR 25 provides access to the Pinnacles National Park east entrance, running parallel to the San Andreas Fault. Running parallel to the Gabilan Range and Diablo Range, SR 25 passes through the communities of Paicines and Tres Pinos before reaching the city of Hollister.\n\nUpon reaching Hollister, the route turns into a four-lane undivided road, curving north and west through the east side of the city. North of Hollister, SR 25 reverts into a 2-lane road and continues northwest from Hollister, intersecting with State Route 156. From there, the route is a partially divided road until just short of a railroad crossing and eventually crossing the Pajaro River into Santa Clara County. The route then heads northwest, and at the intersection with Bloomfield Avenue, the route then curves west before its northern terminus at U.S. Route 101 south of Gilroy.\n\nSR 25 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and a small portion near Hollister is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 25 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.\n\nThe Airline Highway Association was organized in 1933-4 and was composed of representatives of Alameda, Santa Clara, San Benito, Kern and Kings Counties. Its purpose was to establish this \"Airline Highway\". In the Oakland Tribune article, (Tues. June 19, 1934 page 5. \"NEW AIRLINE, HIGHWAY TO L.A. PLANNED\") it states \"the highway would follow the air line between the northern and southern part of the state as closely as possible\". The use of the word Airline is confusing as we associate it with modern-day transportation. In this sense it is defined as an Americanism dating back to 1805 meaning \"traveling a direct route\".\n\n"}

He was a three-time ABA All-Star. Jones' brother Nick also played in the ABA and NBA.\nDuring his time in the ABA, Jones picked up the moniker \"Snapper\" but he never revealed how it came to be.\n\nJones was born in Alexandria, Louisiana, but grew up in Portland, Oregon, where he led Franklin High School to the state basketball championship in 1959. He went on to a standout career at the University of Oregon, pacing the Ducks in scoring during the 1963–64 season.\n\nJones earned ABA All-Star honors three times during eight ABA seasons, averaging 16.0 points while scoring over 10,000 points in 640 games. Jones played for the Oakland Oaks (1967–68), New Orleans Buccaneers (1968–1970), Memphis Pros (1970–71), Dallas Chaparrals (1971–1973), Carolina Cougars (1973–1974), Denver Rockets (1974) and Spirits of St. Louis (1974–1975). Jones was a three time ABA All Star, shot 34% from three-point range and never in his career had a technical foul called against him.\n\nJones then jumped leagues and finished his professional playing career in the NBA out with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1975–76.\n\nJones' broadcasting career began in 1976 (the season after he retired as a player with the Portland Trail Blazers), when he became a color commentator for CBS. He was part of the network's crew that handled the Blazers championship game against the Philadelphia 76ers. He also served as color analyst for the Blazers that year and stayed on into the 1990s. Jones' other broadcasting credits include stints with TNT, TBS, USA Network and the Denver Nuggets. Jones joined NBC shortly after the network obtained the rights to telecast NBA games prior to the 1990-91 season.\n\nAfter serving as an analyst on \"The NBA on NBC\" for 13 years, Jones then worked the same position for NBA TV.\n\nOne of Jones' career highlights was his assignment as basketball analyst with Chick Hearn and Jim Durham in Barcelona, as part of the NBC coverage of men's basketball during the 1992 Olympic Games. In that capacity he worked the equivalent of almost one-half of an NBA season, 36 games, in just two weeks.\n\nWhen he worked at NBC, Jones was typically paired up with former NBA teammate Bill Walton for NBA games due to the point-counterpoint style of banter between the two. He gained notoriety while announcing with Bill Walton for reining in his verbose outbursts, often responding to Walton's sometimes sensational statements with phrases such as \"Bill, you can't be serious...\" Though they typically argued and disagreed during games, the two had a mutual respect for each other and remained good friends. They reunited on Walton's short-lived TV show \"Bill Walton's Long Strange Trip.\"\n\nJones' health began declining in 2005 when he suffered a ruptured appendix while on assignment in New York.

{"id": "1918484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918484", "title": "Aggiornamento", "text": "Aggiornamento\n\nAggiornamento (, plural: aggiornamenti), \"bringing up to date\", was one of the key words used during the Second Vatican Council both by bishops and the clergy attending the sessions, and by the media and Vaticanologists covering it. It was used to mean throwing open the doors of the Church in a desire to dialogue with the outside world. It was the name given to the pontifical program of John XXIII in a speech he gave on January 25, 1959.\n\nSince the pontificate of Pope Pius X, the Church had set itself firmly against modernism. Pope Pius XI identified the enemy as those who said that “the Roman Pontiff can and ought to come to terms with Progress, Liberalism, and the New Civilisation.” But Pope John XXIII had a different response to change in the modern world, to \"throw open the windows of the Church so that we can see out and the people can see in.\" Bishop Christopher Butler, a participant in Vatican II and prolific author, expressed this aggiornamento, as John XXIII had called it, in a way that would become more evident during Francis' papacy. Butler said that the new \"pastoral aim, the instinct of a charity that goes beyond all boundaries, the sense of mission not so much to human nature or the abstract human species, but to human persons and the actually existing human family, demanded that our aggiornamento should be conceived of in depth.\" The bishops at Vatican II, Butler explained, recognized that great changes in the human environment and world required serious adaptation of the Church to respond to this new environment. The pre-Vatican II church remained fashioned after the manner of rule in the Holy Roman Empire, and in its Counter-Reformation mode. Such a Church was, according to Bishop Butler, moving toward \"monumental irrelevance\". Proclamation of the gospel is the first task of the Church, and so it must make this gospel intelligible and relevant to the people of each age, and now to the whole world of diverse peoples represented by their bishops at Vatican II. For this the Council, in a spirit of aggiornamento, reached back \"behind St Thomas himself and the Fathers, to the biblical theology which governs the first two chapters of the <nowiki>\"Constitution on the Church\"</nowiki>.\"\n\nOriginally, as John XXIII announced in his 1959 speech, the word only referred to an update of the 1917 Code of Canon law. The revised Code of Canon Law was not completed until 1983, though. The term describing the Canon law update was eventually broadened to refer to the larger process of Church reform sought at Vatican II.\n\nIn June 1961, in an address to a group of Blessed Sacrament Fathers, John XXIII said \n\nThe conciliar document most often associated with the aggiornamento is \"Gaudium et spes\". The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated.\n\nFrench theologian Yves Congar was a lead theological consultant (peritus) during the Council. Congar was monitored by Holy Office as early as the 1930s and silenced in the 1950s after the Raid on the French Dominicans. His reputation recovered in 1960 when Pope John XXIII invited Congar to serve on the preparatory theological commission of the Second Vatican Council. After the pre-developed council plans were discarded by the attending bishops, Congar played a significant role in the discussions between the Curial minority and the Episcopal majority at Vatican II. In November 1994, Congar was named a Cardinal by Pope John Paul II.\n\nOne of the \"sign of the times\" that Vatican II dealt with was that scholasticism, which dominated Catholic philosophy and theology from the 13th into the 20th century, had little appeal for the modern mind. From the late 19th century, \"neo-scholasticism\" was supported by the hierarchy but with diminishing success. From the period 1935 to 1960 several French and German theologians proposed going back to before scholasticism, with what was called a \"\"\"ressourcement\"\"\" approach, looking for inspiration in the early church and in the Church Fathers as interpreters of the New Testament. The term \"<nowiki>\"</nowiki>Nouvelle théologie<nowiki>\"</nowiki>\" was attached to this theology, at first by those who opposed it. There was wide support for ressourcement at Vatican II. After the council, when those who were more conservative emphasized the traditionalist element in ressourcement in their journal \"Communio\", a more progressive group emphasized discontinuities and became more identified with aggiornamento, advocated in their journal \"Concilium\".\n\nPaul VI went on to adopt Pope John's motto for himself, as he stated in Ecclesiam suam : \"We cannot forget Pope John XXIII's word aggiornamento which We have adopted as expressing the aim and object of Our own pontificate. Besides ratifying it and confirming it as the guiding principle of the Ecumenical Council, We want to bring it to the notice of the whole Church. It should prove a stimulus to the Church to increase its ever growing vitality and its ability to take stock of itself and give careful consideration to the signs of the times, always and everywhere \"proving all things and holding fast that which is good\" with the enthusiasm of youth\".\n\nSome conservatives had warned about excessive progressivism and had repeated the final sentence of the 1861 Syllabus of Errors : \"The Roman Pontiff can, and ought to, reconcile himself, and come to terms with progress, liberalism and modern civilization\".\n\nCardinal Francis Spellman, who had been nominated by Pius XII, was reportedly cautious of \"aggiornamento\" and, before departing to Rome, declared, \"No change will get past the Statue of Liberty.\" The Cardinal believed that predominantly liberal clergymen were being appointed to the Council's commissions, and opposed the introduction of vernacular into the Mass, saying, \"The Latin language, which is truly the Catholic language, is unchangeable, is not vulgar, and has for many centuries been the guardian of the unity of the Western Church.\"\n\n\"Aggiornamenti\" were particularly associated with the much repeated phrase in the Church in the 1960s the \"sign of the times\", meaning an attempt to learn from the world and read the signs of the times. Some see the time of John Paul II as a retrenchment from the solid advancements of Vatican II and the contribution of Pope Francis as \"reconnecting of the church with the energy of the Second Vatican Council, the energy coming out of that council\".\n\n"}

Some scholars feel that this error was probably in the original version of Matthew, but that it was corrected by later translators. Brown feels it is just as likely the error was made by whoever transcribed the OSS.\n\nNormally Matthew does not mention which Old Testament book is being quoted. His standard format is to introduce an OT quotation by \"so it might be fulfilled.\" In this verse he makes an exception to state that it is the words of a prophet being fulfilled. Schweizer believes this is an attempt to distance God from the Massacre of the Innocents by placing the prophet as an intermediate. This serves to reduce the impression that God mandated that the massacre take place.\n\nThese same lines reappear at to again introduce a verse accredited to Jeremiah.\n"}

Macy, Sarah Jessica Parker, Alec Baldwin, Julia Stiles, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rebecca Pidgeon, David Paymer, Patti LuPone, Clark Gregg, and Charles Durning.\n\nThe plot involves the on-location production in Waterford, Vermont, of a film called \"The Old Mill\". The actual film was shot in Massachusetts in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Beverly, Dedham and Waltham.\n\n\"State and Main\" received favorable reviews from critics.\n\nHavoc is wrought on the inhabitants of a small New England town by a troubled film production. After the leading man's penchant for underage girls gets them banished from their New Hampshire location, the crew relocates to the small town of Waterford, Vermont, to finish shooting \"The Old Mill\".\n\nAs its title suggests, the film depends on the presence of a genuine mill, something the town is reported to possess. Unfortunately, with only days before principal photography begins, it becomes apparent that the mill in fact burned down decades ago.\n\nUnfazed, the film's director, Walt Price (William H. Macy), places his faith in the ability of first-time screenwriter Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to alter the script. What he doesn't count on is White's apparently bottomless reserve of angst-fueled writer's block. A local bookseller, Annie Black (Rebecca Pidgeon), tries to provide White with inspiration.\n\nThe film's leading lady (Sarah Jessica Parker) refuses to do her contracted nude scene unless she's paid an additional $800,000, while the foreign cinematographer offends the locals by messing with a historic firehouse. Meanwhile, the leading man, Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), dallies with Carla (Julia Stiles), a crafty local teen.\n\nEverything comes to a head after Barrenger and Carla are injured in a car accident, which leads White (the only witness) to another emotional quandary and into the arms of Annie. Meanwhile, a powerful movie producer (David Paymer) comes to town to help Price with the ensuing mess.\n\n\nSeveral scenes were filmed at the Endicott Estate in Dedham, Massachusetts.\n\nAs of December 2017, \"State and Main\" holds an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\n"}

This was the first Simple Minds album recorded without keyboardist and original bandmember Mick MacNeil, who left the band shortly after the previous tour completed in 1990. The core band on this album comprise only Jim Kerr, Charlie Burchill, and Mel Gaynor (who all appear on the rear cover), with the remaining personnel all being session musicians.\n\nThe album features several songs that are reworkings of older material or were reworked into new songs on subsequent releases. \"Let the Children Speak\" is based on the 1981 Simple Minds instrumental \"Theme for Great Cities\" from \"Sister Feelings Call\". A re-recorded version of that piece, called \"Theme for Great Cities '91\" appeared as a B-side of the \"See the Lights\" single. \"Travelling Man\" bears some resemblance to the 1983 song \"Waterfront\" from \"Sparkle in the Rain\". \"When Two Worlds Collide\" is based on the title track as is the 1995 song \"And the Band Played On\" which subsequently appeared on the following album \"Good News from the Next World\". \"Women and Ghosts\" [included on the US edition of 1995 single \"Hypnotised\"] is a reworked instrumental version of the title track.\n\nThe original album cover was replaced in later pressings by the original rear cover shot of the band (see infobox).\n\nThe album reached No. 2 in the UK, and No. 74 in the United States. Four singles from the album were Top 40 hits in the UK, including the Top 10 hit \"Let There Be Love\". In the US, \"See the Lights\" reached the Top 40 and also reached No. 1 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nVirgin reissued the CD as part of the Simple Minds remasters in late 2002 and early 2003.

Digital comics commonly take the form of mobile comics. Webcomics may also fall under the \"digital comics\" umbrella.\n\nWith the growing use of smartphones, tablets, and desktop screen reading, major publishers begun releasing comics, graphic novels and Manga in digital formats. Declining sales and copyright violation have led some publishers to find new ways to publish their comics, while others are just adapting to the digital age while still having great success with the printed comic format. American publishers' attempts at creating digital publishing platforms for local comics and Manga have thus far been more successful than attempts with digital Manga publishing in Japan, which have lacked a coherent strategy to create successful digital platforms in which to publish, and had revenue considerations from the impact of illegal scanlation. Some attempts in Japan have been made, but failed, such as JManga; while others merged with larger worldwide distributors as in the case of Square Enix digital publishing joining the Hachette Book Group for distribution in over 200 countries. Some western notable platforms such as Graphicly have closed down due to the creators getting hired by the self-publishing platform Blurb.\n\ncomiXology is a cloud-based digital comics platform that offers material from over 75 publishers and independent creators, which can be bought or downloaded for free. Its publishers catalog includes both big western publishers such as Marvel Comics and DC; and translations of Manga through publishers such as Tokyopop. As of 2014 the platform is owned by Amazon.com.\n\nMarvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read online many comics from Marvel's history, on November 13, 2007. The service also includes periodic releases of new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of \"Avenging Spider-Man\", Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.\n\nImage Comics launched its 'Image Digital Comics Store store' in 2013 which is a part of its company website. It got attention for selling comics digitally that are DRM-free, thereby allowing users to download their comics in PDF, EPUB, and the CBR or CBZ Comic Book Archive file formats to their various electronic devices. It also has exclusive digital releases on its website and offers 5-page previews of its comics online. Image Comics was the first big publisher to offer DRM-free digital comics in the U.S., stating that it believes that consumers should be able to own what they have bought in the case of a platform having major technical problems or leaving the market altogether. It also stated that it does not see infringement as a big problem as most consumers will buy comics that are of high quality.\n\nSince 2012, DC Comics has offered to sell its comics through all three major E-book stores: Amazon Kindle Store, iBookstore and Nook Store, as well as through the site www.readdcentertainment.com and through comiXology. DC Comics was the first to offer readers multiple formats to download and digital issues releases on the same day as their printed counterparts. The company stated that it sees the future in digital comics, but its digital sales also help the printed books.\n\nDark Horse Comics launched its online digital store in 2011 which supports both computers, iOS and Android devices. The site allows over 2,000 comics to be previewed.\n\nThe website Humble Bundle was originally created in 2010 for selling time-limited pay-what-you-want indie game bundles. Since 2012 it has been putting up pay-what-your-want book bundles, which now and then featured comics. The first fully dedicated comic bundle was in April 2014, hosting material from Image comics. The Humble Comic Bundles are digital rights management-free and support charities. The website has hosted comic bundles from some publisher such as Dark Horse Comics, Top Cow, Oni Press, Boom! Studios and Valiant Comics, among others. The idea behind the bundles from publisher standpoint is to try to find new audiences for their products at heavily discounted prices.\n\nIn 2013, Panel Syndicate received critical acclaim and media attention for its role publishing one of the first DRM-free, pay what you want comics by high caliber creators.\n\nIn Asia, digital comics have become very popular due to readers mostly reading titles on their smartphones and the lower barrier to create their own comics. In some countries, digital comics have revitalized the industry or even created them where they didn't exist before.\n\nIn China, digital comics are known as \"web manhua\" and many of the big internet giants in the country have created platforms for anyone to submit their own works and read many titles for free, \"U17\" being an example. Thanks in part to free access to these comics and most being in color, the manhua industry has seen a surge in revenue and production in both China and Taiwan. On those platforms, there are comics created by so-called \"Platinum Authors\" who have over one million \"Paid Subscription/Views\" and one of the most successful one is \"端脑\" (the English version is valled \"Die Now\"). This single comic series has over 2,109,000,000 (2.109 billion) views. The team of authors for this web manhua earned over ten times the US national average salary. In recent years, several web manhua have been adapted into animated series, with some in co-production with the Japanese animation industry.\n\nIn Japan, web manga have started to pick up steam as many manga artists choose to upload their own original works on image hosting sites and social media forgoing traditional publishers. Many of the big publishers have also launched digital magazines and websites where web manga get released alongside traditional print works. Unlike digital comics in other Asian countries, web manga are almost always released in black-in-white rather than color despite being released digitally in contrast to titles released in nearby countries.\n\nThe South Korean manhwa industry actually created their own original format for comics called webtoons which helped revitalized the manhwa industry in the country. Before, the industry had difficulty taking off and becoming popular among readers due to the popularity of translated manga and lack of support for local titles. Webtoons have brought in new readers and fans of manhwa, both in South Korea and around the world. The popularity of webtoons has even led to other countries adopting the format to release their own comics.\n\n\n\n"}

Members of the brush-footed butterfly family Nymphalidae, the genus is represented by about 17 species. Two very similar and coexisting genera are \"Tanaecia\" (the viscounts and earls) and \"Euthalia\" (the barons and counts), the latter previously including some \"Lexias\" species. The largest species reach a wingspan of about .\n\n\"Lexias pardalis\" and \"L. dirtea\" are also among the most colourful archdukes. Sexual dichromatism is however extreme, with the two sexes appearing entirely different. The males' dorsal wing surfaces are a dramatic combination of velvety black forewings and metallic blue green to violet covering the margins of the forewings and hindwings. The females' dorsal wing surfaces are a drab brown, with small yellowish white spots. Both sexes have drab ventral wings, presumably as a means of camouflage. The dramatic colours of the males are thought to play a role in intraspecies communication, both by signalling to other males when defending territory, and by attracting females.\n\n\"L. pardalis\" and \"L. dirtea\", two commonly farmed species, are nearly identical and often confused, but they can be distinguished by their differing antennae: the dorsal surface of \"L. pardalis\" antennae tips are yellow orange, whereas they are black in \"L. dirtea\".\n\nCaterpillars of the genus are protected from predators by their long spinous bristles. Archduke chrysalids are pale green and angular in shape; they may be up to 30 mm in length. \"Calophyllum\" trees are host to the caterpillars of Southeast Asian archdukes.\n\nThe observed readiness of Southeast Asian species to feed on both decaying fruit (of \"Garcinia\" tree species) and the nectar of flowers suggests that these species inhabit the forest periphery. Because both types of food are common in this habitat, the Southeast Asian archdukes have not become specialised in feeding on one or the other, as is usual in butterflies. Archdukes are found primarily in virgin forests and are attracted to sunlit areas such as clearings and paths.\n\nSeveral archduke species are raised in large numbers on butterfly farms for the specimen collecting market and for live sale to butterfly conservatories.

The bombers carried several defensive guns and formed up in boxes so that they could provide mutually covering fire but there was interest in providing more firepower for the formation.\nThe XB-41 Liberator was outfitted with 14 .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns. This was achieved by adding a second dorsal turret and a remotely operated Bendix turret (of the same type as fitted to the YB-40) under the chin to the standard twin gun tail turret and twin gun retractable ventral ball turret, plus twin mount guns at each waist window. The port waist mount was originally covered by a Plexiglas bubble; testing showed this caused severe optical distortion and it was removed.\n\nThe XB-41 carried 12,420 rounds of ammunition, 4,000 rounds of which were stored in the bomb bay as a reserve. It was powered by four Pratt & Whitney R-1830-43 radial engines.\n\nOn 29 January 1943, the sole XB-41 was delivered to Eglin Field, Florida. Tests were carried out for two months at Eglin during February 1943. These indicated significant problems with the aircraft; on 21 March 1943, the Army declared the XB-41 as unsuitable for operational use; the conversion of thirteen Liberators to YB-41 service test aircraft was cancelled. Despite this, Consolidated continued to work on the XB-41 prototype; wide-blade propellers were fitted, and some of the armor was removed to reduce the aircraft's weight. Tests resumed at Eglin on 28 July 1943; however, the basic flaws of the \"gunship\" concept remained, and the XB-41 program was abandoned. The prototype XB-41 was redesignated TB-24D; it served as an instructional airframe for training mechanics on the B-24. It was scrapped at Maxwell Field, Alabama on 2 February 1945.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1918546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918546", "title": "Street Fighting Years", "text": "Street Fighting Years\n\nStreet Fighting Years is the eighth studio album by Scottish rock band Simple Minds, released in May 1989 by record label Virgin Records worldwide apart from the US, where it was released by A&M. Produced by Trevor Horn, the album reached the top of the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"Street Fighting Years\" was recorded during yet another period of personnel change for Simple Minds, and was notably the last of the band's albums to feature keyboard player/composer/founder member Mick MacNeil. MacNeil has subsequently mentioned that \"Jim (Kerr) had already started talking about making changes\" and the credits for the album suggested that Simple Minds had officially become a trio of the only three remaining founder members — Jim Kerr, Charlie Burchill and Mick MacNeil (all previous albums had credited the band as a full quintet).\n\nThe lack of equality and unity within the band's ranks soon became evident. Drummer Mel Gaynor was sidelined during the album sessions (apparently after disagreements with Trevor Horn) and was eventually demoted to session player status, with much of the drumming in the studio being performed by Manu Katché (from Peter Gabriel's band) and Stewart Copeland (ex-Police). Bass player John Giblin — who'd joined the band in 1985 for \"Once Upon a Time\" and played on the subsequent tours and the \"Live In The City Of Light\" album — left the band during or immediately after the sessions, despite having made significant contributions to the album (including writing the ballad \"Let It All Come Down\"). The circumstances surrounding Giblin’s departure are undisclosed (although the band's previous bass player Derek Forbes has hinted that ultimately Giblin simply \"didn’t fit in\" with the band). Some of the bass guitar parts on the album were played by producer Stephen Lipson.\n\nProduced by Trevor Horn and Stephen Lipson, it was a major stylistic departure from the previous album, 1985's \"Once Upon a Time\". While still maintaining the epic arena rock sense of scale and drama which the band had developed since the mid-1980s, \"Street Fighting Years\" also moved away from the American soul and gospel influences of its predecessor in favour of soundtrack atmospherics and a new incorporation of acoustic and Celtic/folk music-related ingredients including fretless bass, slide guitar and accordion. The lyrics built on the more political themes which the band had introduced with \"Ghost Dancing\", moving away from the impressionistic or spiritual concerns of earlier 1980s Simple Minds songs and covering topics including the Poll Tax, the Soweto townships, the Berlin Wall and the stationing of nuclear submarines on the Scottish coast.\n\nReleased in May 1989, the album became the band's fourth number one in the UK on the back of the chart-topping single \"Belfast Child\", which had been released three months earlier. \"This Is Your Land\" was chosen as the lead single for the US, but even with guest vocals from the band's idol Lou Reed, the single failed to make a mark on the pop charts. The album performed relatively poorly in the United States and produced no hit singles.\n\nFor the supporting tour, the band would re-hire Mel Gaynor as drummer and recruit Malcolm Foster (The Pretenders) as the new bass guitarist. MacNeil remained with the band during the tour, but quit abruptly at the end of it.\n\nSimple Minds released on 6 March 2020 a 4-CD Super Deluxe box set edition of \"Street Fighting Years\" on UMC / Virgin Domestic, including the original album remastered at Abbey Road Studios, a CD of B-sides, edits and 12″ remixes, a 2-CD unissued Verona live show from 1989 plus brand new book including a new interview with Trevor Horn. Also available as 2-LP, 2-CD or remastered single CD.\n\n\"Street Fighting Years\" received sharply divided reviews, with initial critical opinion being mostly favourable in the UK but less so in the US, where the album was much less of a commercial success. In his written commentary for the sleeve notes in the band's compilation album \"Glittering Prize 81/92\", Brian Hogg described \"Street Fighting Years\" as arguably \"the group's most controversial release.\" Jim Kerr remembered the album thus: \"Every song seemed to be about conflict, and it describes this age of chaos, the battle to try and remain intact with all this hurricane around us.\"\n\nIn Britain, the album received glowing praise, including a rare five-star rating, from \"Q\" magazine; David Sinclair wrote that they had finally produced a record to justify their reputation, and praising the album's mostly quiet dynamic: \"Even when the music takes off into the vast dramatic sweeps that will roll like huge breakers to the back of the stadiums of Europe this summer, there is little that could fairly be described as bluster. Simple Minds have done more than make a landmark album. They have assumed the mantle of authority.\" Ian Gittins, writing for \"Melody Maker\", also commented on the grandiose nature of the album, comparing it to U2's \"Rattle and Hum\" but more artistically successful: \"Unlike their true soulmates, U2, the Minds haven't produced a turkey of the first degree...Simple Minds are once again approaching the art of making music, \"breaking a silence\", with wonder.\" Although he went on to criticize the tracks \"Soul Crying Out\", \"Take a Step Back\", \"Kick It In\", and \"Biko\" as \"flatulent bluster\", Gittins nonetheless concluded that the album's \"expansive, flushed music\" was \"huge, but it's rarely \"hollow\".\" Mike Soutar, meanwhile, wrote in \"Smash Hits\" that the album was \"packed with the kind of crowd-rousing flag hoisting anthems that everyone expects from the Minds\", but thought the song's individual lengths meant that they would \"probably sound epic played live, they'll probably drive you quite mad in the comfort of your own bedroom.\"\n\nLess positive reviews, however, came from U.S. publications such as \"Rolling Stone\" whose writer Mark Coleman criticised the band for what the reviewer considered to be political vacuity: \"\"Street Fighting Years\" stands as an unfortunate example of politicized rock at its most simple-minded.\" He also opined that the album's production was too clean, describing it as \"so studio smooth that every song – whether it's a chugging, multi-layered call to arms (\"Take a Step Back\") or a floating, ambient meditation (\"Let It All Come Down\") – virtually slides out of the speakers.\" \"CMJ\" took a more positive view, admitting that \"Street Fighting Years\" \"lacks the inspirational anthems of the \"Sparkle in the Rain\" era\" but \"focuses attention on the passion of the lyrics, which have a political awareness and social consciousness that keeps those spots where the music falls short up on a high level.\"\n\nThe album's grandiose, stadium-oriented stylistic departure from previous albums has since proved controversial with critics. Martin C. Strong, writing in \"The Essential Rock Discography\", remarked that reviewers \"didn't really stick the knife in until the release of the overblown \"Belfast Child\", a U.K. No. 1 despite its snoozeworthy meandering and vague political agenda. The accompanying album, \"Street Fighting Years\" (1989) brought more of the same, although it cemented Simple Minds' position among the coffee table elite.\" Meanwhile, in a retrospective review for AllMusic, Tom Demalon described \"Street Fighting Years\" as \"an artistic and elegant album that might lack immediate choruses but draws in the listener\" and containing \"some truly lovely moments\". A review of the \"Themes\" box-set released in June 2008 from \"Q\" magazine discussed, \"if at times the preciousness of the later work sets the teeth on edge, the sheer musical skill and undoubted power of the band makes up for it\", praising the \"brilliant atmosphere Simple Minds made their own.\" Music critic David Stubbs, in a review of the compilation \"Glittering Prize 81/92\", mourned what he found to be the \"dramatic artistic decline (and parallel commercial rise)\" of the band: \"As Jim Kerr sank further into mega-stardom, the music suffered further as he indulged in piously cumbersome ballads like \"Belfast Child\" and \"Mandela Day\". John Aizlewood of \"Q\" disagreed, saying, \"there was much to commend on \"Street Fighting Years\" and its follow-up, \"Real Life\"\".\n\nIn 1989 \"Q\" magazine selected \"Street Fighting Years\" as one of the top recordings of the year.\n\nSources\n\n\n\nSingles\n"}

It also provides the information necessary to invoke these properties and methods. Client applications do not need to be aware of the object members when they are compiled. This allows COM and ActiveX objects to be called by scripting programs platforms such as the ASP server and JavaScript on Internet Explorer, where calling conventions were not known at the time IIS or IE were built. By contrast, a simple object library is compiled and linked into a program, e.g. a DLL call needs to know a function name and parameters at compile time.\n\nA script writer can ask the COM object for a method or property it already knows about from documentation. Then, the client can execute the function with Invoke provided by the IDispatch interface, a form of late-binding. This sort of capability was also supported by Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), which never became popular due to being too low-level.\n\n\"Dispatch\" interfaces are flexible, but suffer from additional introspection and invocation overhead compared to \"custom\" interfaces. It is therefore often a good idea to support both interface types with \"dual\" interfaces. That way, clients supporting VTABLE-based invocation can use the \"custom\" interface instead of the \"dispatch\" counterpart.\n\nEach property and method implemented by an object that supports the IDispatch interface has what is called a Dispatch ID, which is often abbreviated DISPID. The DISPID is the primary means of identifying a property or method and must be supplied to the \"Invoke\" function for a property or method to be invoked, along with an array of Variants containing the parameters. The \"GetIDsOfNames\" function can be used to get the appropriate DISPID from a property or method name that is in string format.\n\nIDispatch derives from IUnknown and extends it with four additional methods:\n\ninterface IDispatch : public IUnknown {\n\nThe IDispatch interface ID is defined as a GUID with the value of {00020400-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}.\n\n"}

Additionally, she is remembered as a child actress from the films \"Field of Dreams\", \"Uncle Buck\", \"Now and Then\", and \" Volcano\".\n\nHoffmann was born in New York City, New York. Her mother, Viva (born Janet Susan Mary Hoffmann), is an actress, writer and former Warhol superstar, and her father, Anthony Herrera, was a soap opera actor best known for his role as James Stenbeck from \"As the World Turns\". Viva and Herrera were estranged shortly after Hoffmann's birth; she was raised by her mother at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. Her father did not have a significant presence in her life. Hoffmann's birth is documented in Brigid Berlin's \"The Andy Warhol Diaries\". An entry dated January 10, 1982, two days after Hoffmann was born, says that a friend of Warhol's telephoned Warhol and told him that they were going to the Chelsea Hotel to see Viva and her new baby. \n\nHoffmann's mother was raised in a devout Catholic family on Long Island, the daughter of an attorney. She was previously married to director Michel Auder in 1969. Hoffmann has a half-sister, Alexandra \"Alex\" Auder, who is 11 years older and teaches yoga in New York City. Hoffmann's father was raised in Wiggins, Mississippi by his maternal grandparents. Herrera died in 2011 from cancer.\n\nHoffmann attended elementary school in Manhattan at P.S. 3 on Hudson Street in the West Village, then another school in Hell's Kitchen. After she moved to Los Angeles in 1994, she attended the Buckley School, before finally graduating from Calabasas High School in 1999.\n\nUntil July 1993, Hoffmann lived in Manhattan's Chelsea Hotel (now a landmark), which Hoffmann later said she enjoyed. According to Hoffmann, she and her best friend Talya Shomron would roller-skate in the hallways, spy on the drug dealer across the hall, and persuade the bellman to go to the neighborhood delicatessen at night to fetch them ice cream.\n\nHoffmann recalled, \"I grew up in downtown New York in the '80s. I have a friend who grew up with me, and she puts it well. She says, 'If you grew up where we grew up, if you weren't an artist, a drag queen, queer, or a drug addict, then you were the freak.' I grew up in a world where I guess what is considered unusual or abnormal for the rest of America was very much considered the norm.\" She also reported in an interview that there had been gunfire and a rape at the hotel shortly before they moved out.\n\nHoffmann and her mother left the Chelsea Hotel after a long-standing dispute with the management that ended in eviction. Regardless, Hoffmann's connection to the hotel resulted in a significant effect on her future. The idea for the 1994 sitcom \"Someone Like Me\" originated after Gail Berman (former president of Viacom's Paramount Pictures) read a \"New York Times\" article about the hotel which referred to a children's book that Viva and friend Jane Lancellotti wrote, \"Gaby at the Chelsea\" (a take on Kay Thompson's 1950s classic Eloise books). Berman became the show's producer.\n\nWhen Hoffmann was 11 years old, after leaving the Chelsea, Hoffmann and her mother moved to the west coast to a two-bedroom rented house in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, which was badly damaged in the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. While regrouping their living situation, Hoffmann and her mother temporarily lived at The Oceana Suites Hotel in Santa Monica, California.\n\nAfter she graduated from Calabasas High School in 1999, Hoffmann followed her half-sister Alex's example and entered New York's Bard College to pursue a degree in literature and writing. Around 2001, she temporarily left her acting career to complete her studies and graduated in 2004; her senior thesis was a documentary film.\n\nAfter college, she spent much of her 20s drifting. She interned with a chef in Italy, and then trained to be a doula after helping deliver Alex's children. For a time, Hoffmann and a boyfriend lived in an old trailer in the Catskill Mountains.\n\nHoffmann began her acting career at the age of four to help pay the family bills by acting in commercials. In 1989, she starred in her first movie, \"Field of Dreams,\" with Kevin Costner. 1989's \"Uncle Buck\" followed, working beside John Candy and up-and-coming child star Macaulay Culkin. However, she grew tired of the rigors of screen performance and temporarily retired. Nevertheless, upon hearing that Culkin (whom she disliked when they worked together) was making a lot of money in feature films, her \"competitive spirit got the best of her\", as she later put it, and she re-entered the profession. She went on to star in \"This Is My Life\" (1992), \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) with Tom Hanks and \"The Man Without a Face\" with Mel Gibson (who also directed the film). According to Hoffmann, it was the praise she received for her performance in \"This is My Life\" which encouraged her to pursue a full-time acting career in Hollywood as it gave her the confidence she needed to handle major roles.\n\nIn 1994, Hoffmann starred in her own sitcom \"Someone Like Me\" (on NBC) about a young girl, Gaby, and her dysfunctional family. Although generally well received, the show only lasted six episodes. Publicity work for the show included personal appearances by Hoffmann on late night talk shows like \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and \"Late Show with David Letterman\".\n\nAfter \"Someone Like Me\", Hoffmann won the lead role opposite Shelley Long in the 1995 TV film \"Freaky Friday\", a remake of the 1976 film of the same name starring Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris. In the same year as \"Freaky Friday\", Hoffmann starred as Young Samantha (the childhood counterpart to Demi Moore's character) in the coming-of-age feature film, \"Now and Then\".\n\nIn 1995, Hoffmann played Andrea Eagerton in the CBS TV film \"Whose Daughter Is She?\".\n\nBetween 1996 and 2001, Hoffmann landed roles in several films including \"Everyone Says I Love You\" (1996), \"Volcano\" (1997), \"Snapped\" (1998), \"The Hairy Bird\" (1998), \"200 Cigarettes\" (1999), \"Coming Soon\" (1999), \"Black & White\" (1999), \"You Can Count on Me\" (2000), and \"Perfume\" (2001).\n\nBetween 2003 and 2007, Hoffmann largely concentrated on a theatre career in New York. Roles included \"24 Hour Plays\" (as Denise at the American Airlines Theatre), \"The Sugar Syndrome\" (Williamstown Theatre Festival – July/August 2005), and \"Third\" (Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater/Lincoln Center Theater – September – December 2005). In late 2005, she starred in an episode of \"\". She also appeared in the Broadway play \"Suburbia\", alongside Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw at the Second Stage Theatre on 43rd Street in New York City, which ran from September to October 2006. Hoffmann then returned to the \"24 Hours Plays\" where she acted alongside Jennifer Aniston.\n\nSince 2007, Hoffmann has made a gradual return to film acting. In 2007, she starred in the film \"Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America\". In 2008, she appeared in \"Guest of Cindy Sherman\", a documentary on art-scene commentator Paul Hasegawa-Overacker's relationship with enigmatic photographer Cindy Sherman. Sherman was married to Hoffman's stepfather, Michel Auder, from 1984 to 1999. Later in 2008, Hoffmann appeared in the documentary \"Chelsea on the Rocks\", which is a tribute to the Chelsea Hotel where she grew up. Directed by Abel Ferrara, the documentary highlights the many personalities and artistic voices that have emerged from the legendary residence.\n\nIn 2009, Hoffmann had a supporting role in Todd Solondz's \"Life During Wartime\", and the thriller \"13\" with Mickey Rourke (released in 2010).\n\nMore recently, Hoffmann has starred alongside Michael Cera in \"Crystal Fairy & the Magical Cactus\" (2013). While shooting the film in Chile, she and Cera took mescaline for her performance in a climactic scene.\n\nRecent guest appearances have been in the television series \"Louie\" and \"Girls\" in Season 3. Hoffmann also appeared in seasons 4 and 5 of \"Girls.\"\n\nIn 2013, she completed work on the lead role of a Web series entitled \"Lyle\", created by Stewart Thorndike and Jill Soloway. It was shot in NYC. She subsequently acquired an apartment in Brooklyn's Fort Greene section. In October 2013, she starred in the 1910s installment of Vanity Fair's \"The Decades Series\", \"The First March\", directed by Gilly Barnes.\n\nHoffmann has discussed her full frontal nude scenes in a few of her recent projects including \"Crystal Fairy\", \"Girls\" and the Amazon series \"Transparent.\" On nudity, Hoffmann said: \"People are obsessed with actresses being hairless, fatless Barbie dolls. They can’t imagine that people would want to be anything other than that. When they are, it's looked at as almost a political statement. Look at Lena Dunham. She is a gorgeous woman and people can't stop talking about how brave she is to show herself naked, which I find totally condescending and ridiculous. If Angelina Jolie was naked onscreen no one would say she was brave. The implication is that Lena's brave because she doesn't look the way she's supposed to look. I think that's a shame.\"\n\nJill Soloway wrote the role Hoffmann plays in \"Transparent\" for her after seeing her performance on Louis C.K.'s third season of \"Louie.\"\n\nIn 2016 she appeared in video as an onstage \"stand-in\" during the Nostalgic For the Present concert tour of Australian singer Sia Furler for her song, \"Unstoppable.\"\n\nHoffmann has a daughter, born in 2014, with longtime boyfriend, cinematographer Chris Dapkins (born on November 19, 1980). She lives in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn.\n\nHoffmann endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n"}

She was formerly a sideline reporter for NBA games on TNT Sports and also works for NBA TV as a reporter and analyst, having worked previously as a sportscaster for ABC Sports, TBS Sports, and ESPN. She was also head coach and general manager of the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury.\nIn 1995, Miller was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1999, she was inducted into the inaugural class of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, located in Knoxville, Tennessee. On August 20, 2010, Miller was also inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame for her success in international play.\n\nShe is the sister of retired National Basketball Association (NBA) Hall of Famer Reggie Miller and former Major League Baseball catcher Darrell Miller.\n\nMiller played at Riverside Polytechnic High School (1978–1982) where she was a four-year letter winner and led her team to a 132–4 record. She was awarded the Dial Award for the national high-school scholar-athlete of the year in 1981. She was the first player, male or female, to be named an All-American by \"Parade\" magazine four times. Averaging 32.8 points and 15.0 rebounds a game, Miller was Street & Smith's national High School Player of the Year in both 1981 and 1982. In her senior year she scored 105 points in a game against Norte Vista High School. She set California state records for points scored in a single season (1156), and points scored in a high school career (3405).\n\nAt the University of Southern California (USC), the 6 ft. 2 in. (1.87 m) Miller played the forward position. She was a four-year letter winner, scored 3,018 career points (tenth all-time in NCAA history), and was a four-time All-American. Her career rebounding mark of 1,534 ranks her third all-time in NCAA history. Miller was named Naismith College Player of the Year three times and earned the Wade Trophy (Player of the Year) once. At USC, Miller led the Trojans to a 112–20 record and NCAA titles in 1983 and 1984 and was named NCAA Tournament MVP both years. Miller's teammates included Cynthia Cooper, two-time WNBA MVP; Pamela McGee, 1984 Olympian and All-American, and Paula McGee, 1982 and 1983 All-American. Miller was coached by Linda K. Sharp, one of college basketball's most winning coaches. In her senior season, Miller picked up her third Naismith Award, the Broderick Award as the Female College Basketball Player of the Year and Sports Illustrated named her the best player in college basketball, male or female. Miller still holds numerous Trojan career records, including points (3,018, 23.6 ppg), rebounds (1,534, 12.0 rpg), field goals made (1,159), free throws made (700), games played (128), and steals (462). Miller's previous Trojan records in assists (414) was almost doubled by Rhonda Windham (735); Lisa Leslie topped her blocked shot record by one (321).\n\nIn 1986, Miller was nominated for the James E. Sullivan Award, and in that same year, USC retired her #31 jersey, the first retired jersey of a basketball player, male or female, at USC.\n\nIn 1993 she took the head coaching job at her alma mater, USC, after the university chose to fire coach Marianne Stanley.\n\nAs a chemistry major at USC, Miller's class schedule included courses such as organic chemistry and quantum physics.\n\nSource\n\nMiller played for the USA National team in the 1983 World Championships, held in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The team won six games, but lost two against the Soviet Union. In an opening round game, the USA team had a nine-point lead at halftime, but the Soviets came back to take the lead, and a final shot by the USA failed to drop, leaving the USSR team with a one-point victory 85–84, despite 23 points from Miller. The USA team won their next four games, setting up the gold medal game against USSR. This game was also close, and was tied at 82 points each with six seconds to go in the game. The Soviets Elena Chausova received the inbounds pass and hit the game winning shot in the final seconds, giving the USSR team the gold medal with a score of 84–82. The USA team earned the silver medal. Miller led the team in scoring, averaging 17.6 points per game, and tied for the lead in rebounding at 4.4 per game.\n\nIn 1984, the USA sent its National team to the 1984 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan, for pre-Olympic practice. The team easily beat each of the eight teams they played, winning by an average of just under 50 points per game. Miller led the team in scoring, averaging 15.1 points per game, led the team in rebounding with 4.4 per game and led the team in steals with 27.\n\nMiller led the U.S. team to the gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and was also part of the gold medal team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nMiller was selected to represent the US at the inaugural Goodwill games, held in Moscow in July 1986. North Carolina State's Kay Yow served as head coach. The team opened up with a 72–53 victory over Yugoslavia, led by 19 points from Miller, and followed that with a 21-point win over Brazil 91–70. The third game was against Czechoslovakia and would be much closer. Miller was the scoring leader in this game, scoring 26 points to help the US to a 78–70 victory. The USA faced Bulgaria in the semi-final match up, and again won, this time 67–58. This set up the final against the Soviet Union, led by 7-foot-2 Ivilana Semenova, considered the most dominant player in the world. The Soviet team, had a 152–2 record in major international competition over the prior three decades, including an 84–82 win over the US in the 1983 World Championships. The Soviets held the early edge, leading 21–19 at one time, before the USA went on a scoring run to take a large lead they would never relinquish. The final score was 83–60 in favor of the US, earning the gold medal for the USA squad. For the entire event, Miller averaged 20.6 points to lead the team in scoring.\n\nMiller continued to represent the US with National team at the 1986 World Championships, held in Moscow, a month after the Goodwill games in Moscow. The USA team was even more dominant this time. The early games were won easily, and the semifinal against Canada, while the closest game for the USA so far, ended up an 82–59 victory. At the same time, the Soviet team was winning easily as well, and the final game pitted two teams each with 6–0 records. The Soviet team, having lost only once at home, wanted to show that the Goodwill games setback was a fluke. The USA team started by scoring the first eight points, and raced to a 45–23 lead, although the Soviets fought back and reduced the halftime margin to 13. The USA went on a 15–1 run in the second half to put the game away, and ended up winning the gold medal with a score of 108–88. Miller led all scorers in the game with 24 points.\n\n\nAfter graduating from USC in 1986, she was drafted by several professional basketball leagues, including the United States Basketball League, a men's league. However, in the late 1980s, Miller suffered knee injuries that prevented her from continuing her playing career. From 1986 to 1991, she worked as an assistant coach at USC and as a television sportscaster.\n\nMiller was named Head Coach at USC and coached two seasons (1993–95). Her teams had a combined 42–14 record and went to the NCAA tournament both seasons, making a Regional Final once. She then coached for four seasons (1997–2000) with the Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA, where she also served as General Manager. \"Run, run, run, run, run,\" Miller said about her kind of team. \"Play some outstanding defense. I want this team to be physical, I want them to know the game.\" In 1998, Miller coached the Mercury to a 16–12 record and to the WNBA Finals, where her team lost to the Houston Comets. She resigned after the 2000 season, citing fatigue.\n\nOn April 30, 2014, she was named the women's basketball coach at Langston University by athletic director Mike Garrett.\n\nOn May 26, 2016, she was named the women's basketball coach at California State Los Angeles by athletic director Mike Garrett.\n\nCheryl Miller served as a sideline reporter for the \"NBA on TNT\"’s Thursday night doubleheader coverage for TNT Sports. She also made appearances on NBA TV during the 2008-09 NBA season as a reporter and analyst. Miller joined Turner Sports in September 1995 as an analyst and reporter for the \"NBA on TBS\" and TNT. She did make occasional appearances as Studio Analyst for the NBA games. In November 1996, she became the first female analyst to call a nationally televised NBA game (TBS). She also served as the sideline reporter in 2K Sports' \"NBA 2K\" Series. She left the company after her contract expired in 2013.\n\nMiller worked as a Basketball Commentator at the 1994 Goodwill Games. Miller worked as a basketball reporter and called weightlifting for the 2001 Goodwill Games.

Her performance in \"The Penguin\" (1940), at the Call Board Theatre in Hollywood, was reviewed as demonstrating unusual eccentric comedy gifts. That same year, she appeared in \"And Eternal Darkness\" at the Call Board and the review read, \"Molly Dodd as the love interest was appealing.\"\n\nIn February 1947, Dodd received a citation from the USO for her performance in Noël Coward's \"Private Lives\" at United States Army camps. She acted in numerous stage productions through the years, including summer stock in La Jolla.\n\nDodd was in only four theatrical movies. She first appeared as a beautician in Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\" (1958) starring James Stewart and Kim Novak. She also appeared as Mrs. Rigg in \"What's the Matter with Helen?\" (1971), which was written by her husband, writer Henry Farrell, and starred Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters. In 1965, Dodd and actor/writer Robert Lansing formed the State Repertory Theatre as a rallying ground for professional actors who wanted to do plays outside the realm of commercial theatre. They did various productions – \"Spoon River Anthology\", a concert titled \"From Our Bag\", Pirandello's \"As You Desire Me\", and a double-bill titled \"Those Mad Victorians\", which the company took to Caltech in the late 1960s. When they returned to Caltech the following season, they performed \"An Evening With Oscar Wilde\", a concert reading based on Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" and \"The House of Pomegranates\", with Dodd as one of the players. \n\nShe made a number of guest appearances on various top-rated TV shows, including \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Gomer Pyle\", \"Hazel\", \"Petticoat Junction\", \"The Brady Bunch\", \"Bewitched\" and \"The Rockford Files\".

This idea is more broadly referred to as programmable matter. Claytronics has the potential to greatly affect many areas of daily life, such as telecommunication, human-computer interfaces, and entertainment.\n\nCurrent research is exploring the potential of modular reconfigurable robotics and the complex software necessary to control the “shape changing” robots. “Locally Distributed Predicates or LDP is a distributed, high-level language for programming modular reconfigurable robot systems (MRRs)”. There are many challenges associated with programming and controlling a large number of discrete modular systems due to the degrees of freedom that correspond with each module. For example, reconfiguring from one formation to one similar may require a complex path of movements controlled by an intricate string of commands even though the two shapes differ slightly.\n\nIn 2005, research efforts to develop a hardware concept were successful on the scale of millimeters, creating cylindrical prototypes 44 millimeters in diameter which interact with each other via electromagnetic attraction. Their experiments helped researchers verify the relationship between mass and potential force between objects as “a 10-fold reduction in size [which] should translate to a 100-fold increase in force relative to mass”. Recent advancements in this prototype concept are in the form of one millimeter diameter cylindrical robots fabricated on a thin film by photolithography that would cooperate with each other using complex software that would control electromagnetic attraction and repulsion between modules.\n\nToday, extensive research and experiments with claytronics are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by a team of researchers which consists of Professors Todd C. Mowry, Seth Goldstein, graduate and undergraduate students, and researchers from Intel Labs Pittsburgh.\n\nThe driving force behind programmable matter is the actual hardware that is manipulating itself into whatever form is desired. Claytronics consists of a collection of individual components called claytronic atoms, or catoms. In order to be viable, catoms need to fit a set of criteria. First, catoms need to be able to move in three dimensions relative to each other and be able to adhere to each other to form a three-dimensional shape. Second, the catoms need to be able to communicate with each other in an ensemble and be able to compute state information, possibly with assistance from each other. Fundamentally, catoms consist of a CPU, a network device for communication, a single pixel display, several sensors, an onboard battery, and a means to adhere to one another.\n\nThe researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed various prototypes of catoms. These vary from small cubes to giant helium balloons. The prototype that is most like what developers hope catoms will become is the planar catom. These take the form of 44 mm diameter cylinders. These cylinders are equipped with 24 electromagnets arranged in a series of stacked rings along the cylinder's circumference. Movement is achieved by the catoms cooperatively enabling and disabling the magnets in order to roll along each other's surfaces. Only one magnet on each catom is energized at a time. These prototypes are able to reconfigure themselves quite quickly, with the uncoupling of two units, movement to another contact point, and recoupling taking only about 100 ms. Power is supplied to the catoms using pickup feet on the bottom of the cylinder. Conductive strips on the table supply the necessary power.\n\nIn the current design, the catoms are only able to move in two dimensions relative to each other. Future catoms will be required to move in three dimensions relative to each other. The goal of the researchers is to develop a millimeter scale catom with no moving parts, to allow for mass manufacturability. Millions of these microrobots will be able to emit variable color and intensity of light, allowing for dynamic physical rendering. The design goal has shifted to creating catoms that are simple enough to only function as part of an ensemble, with the ensemble as a whole being capable of higher function.\n\nAs the catoms are scaled down, an onboard battery sufficient to power it will exceed the size of the catom itself, so an alternate energy solution is desired. Research is being done into powering all of the catoms in an ensemble, utilizing the catom-to-catom contact as a means of energy transport. One possibility being explored is using a special table with positive and negative electrodes and routing the power internally through the catoms, via “virtual wires.”\n\nAnother major design challenge will be developing a genderless unary connector for the catoms in order to keep reconfiguration time at a minimum. Nanofibers provide a possible solution to this challenge. Nanofibers allow for great adhesion on a small scale and allow for minimum power consumption when the catoms are at rest.\n\nOrganizing all of the communication and actions between millions of sub-millimeter scale catoms requires development of advanced algorithms and programming languages. The researchers and engineers of Carnegie Mellon-Intel Claytronics Research Lab launched a wide range of projects to develop the necessary software to facilitate communication between catoms.\nThe most important projects are developing new programming languages which work more efficiently for claytronics. The goal of a claytronics matrix is to dynamically form three-dimensional shapes. However, the vast number of catoms in this distributed network increases complexity of micro-management of each individual catom. So, each catom must perceive accurate position information and command of cooperation with its neighbors. In this environment, software language for the matrix operation must convey concise statements of high-level commands in order to be universally distributed. Languages to program a matrix require a more abbreviated syntax and style of command than normal programming languages such as C++ and Java.\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon-Intel Claytronics Research Project has created two new programming languages: Meld and Locally Distributed Predicates (LDP).\n\nMeld is a declarative language, a logic programming language originally designed for programming overlay networks. By using logic programming, the code for an ensemble of robots can be written from a global perspective, enabling the programmer to concentrate on the overall performance of the claytronics matrix rather than writing individual instructions for every one of the thousands to millions of catoms in the ensemble. This dramatically simplifies the thought process for programming the movement of a claytronics matrix.\n\nLDP is a reactive programming language. It has been used to trigger debugging in the earlier research. With the addition of language that enables the programmer to build operations in the development of the shape of the matrix, it can be used to analyze the distributed local conditions. It can operate on fixed-size, connected groups of modules providing various functions of state configuration. A program that addresses a fixed-size module rather than the entire ensemble allows programmers to operate the claytronic matrix more frequently and efficiently. LDP further provides a means of matching distributed patterns. It enables the programmer to address a larger set of variables with Boolean logic, which enables the program to search for larger patterns of activity and behavior among groups of modules.\n\nPerformance errors for thousands to millions of individual catoms are hard to detect and debug, therefore, claytronics matrix operations require a dynamic and self-directed process for identifying and debugging errors. Claytronics researchers have developed Distributed Watchpoints, an algorithm-level approach to detecting and fixing errors missed by more conventional debugging techniques. It establishes nodes that receive surveillance to determine the validity of distributed conditions. This approach provides a simple and highly descriptive set of rules to evaluate distributed conditions and proves effective in the detection of errors.\n\nTwo important classes of claytronics algorithms are shape sculpting and localization algorithms. The ultimate goal of claytronics research is creating dynamic motion in three-dimensional poses. All the research on catom motion, collective actuation and hierarchical motion planning require shape sculpting algorithms to convert catoms into the necessary structure, which will give structural strength and fluid movement to the dynamic ensemble. Meanwhile, localization algorithms enable catoms to localize their positions in an ensemble. A localization algorithm should provide accurate relational knowledge of catoms to the whole matrix based on noisy observation in a fully distributed manner.\n\nAs the capabilities of computing continue to develop and robotic modules shrink, claytronics will become useful in many applications. The featured application of claytronics is a new mode of communication. Claytronics will offer a more realistic sense to communication over long distance called pario. Similar to how audio and video provide aural and visual stimulation, pario provides an aural, visual and physical sensation. A user will be able to hear, see and touch the one communicating with them in a realistic manner. Pario could be used effectively in many professional disciplines from engineering design, education and healthcare to entertainment and leisure activities such as video games.\n\nThe advancements in nanotechnology and computing necessary for claytronics to become a reality are feasible, but the challenges to overcome are daunting and will require great innovation. In a December 2008 interview, Jason Campbell, a lead researcher from Intel Labs Pittsburgh, said, \"my estimates of how long it is going to take have gone from 50 years down to just a couple more years. That has changed over the four years I’ve been working on the project\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1918610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918610", "title": "Gulf Coast Riptide", "text": "Gulf Coast Riptide\n\nThe Gulf Coast Riptide was a women's American football full contact football team in the Women's Spring Football League founded in 2001 as the Pensacola Power of the National Women's Football Association. The WFA plays under NFL rules with minor modifications such as ball size and kick off placement. Their home field was Escambia High School in West Pensacola. This team no longer plays.\n\nThe team's history started one cool Saturday morning in February 2001. That's when Catherine Masters (NWFA CEO & founder) held tryouts for the first women's football team in Pensacola. Ray Quinn (Head Coach & owner of the Alabama Renegades) and Tim Smart (Power Head Coach Candidate) were on hand to greet the first batch of football hopefuls. Over 120 women tried out for the team over the next three weekends but only 60 could make the squad. After a laborious selection process, 60 women were chosen and the team was ready to get started.\n\nThe Power had less than 2 months to select a team, get in shape, order equipment and learn the fundamentals of the game. Expectations for the first season were understandably moderate. With 4 games against teams from Nashville and Huntsville, (teams with 8 games under their belts) the Power was optimistically hoping for a 4-4 season.\n\nThe Power burst on the NWFA scene with a vengeance setting records for attendance ranging from a reported 2,500 to 5,000 fans per game. No one was disappointed. During the course of their first season the Power recorded the first ever undefeated regular season, earned the Southern Division Title with the 2nd ranked defense and the 2nd ranked offense in the league led by team captain and starting quarterback (Julie Moss), they had the leagues first and only 1,000 yard rusher (Jill Penderghest), the league leader in interceptions (Jodi Albright), the leagues’ best punter and field goal kicker (Emily Morgan) and earned a berth in the first ever National Women's Football Association National Championship game. While the Power lost the championship game to nerves and the overwhelming size and strength of the Philadelphia Liberty Belles, no one could have asked for a better start.\n\nThe 2002 season began under a heavy cloud of doubt. After an awesome 8-1 inaugural season but after bad management, the Power was given a new life. Bolstered by new ownership and confidence, the Power prepared for the 2002 season. With about 25 returning veterans the Power had a solid core to build on. The NWFA had added another 10 teams to the league and had recreated itself into five conferences. The Power found itself in the new Gulf Coast Division with teams from Biloxi, Panama City and New Orleans. The Power was quick to use its experience and power to dominate divisional opponents and wrapped up its second consecutive undefeated season and divisional title. They outscored their opponents 421-19. They had the #1 rated offense and the #2 rated defense in the league. The Power defeated the Alabama Renegades 12-8 in the first round of the playoffs but fell to the eventual National Champion, the Detroit Danger by a score of 14-7. The Power has amassed a 17-2 (.894 winning percentage) record over the last two years.\n\nUnlike the 2001 season the 2002 season was a success on and off the field. With new management and solid financial controls the Power ended the year with zero debt and the ability to start the 2003 season with a small balance in the bank.\n\nHead Coach Tim Smart - who is a retired Air Force Officer currently coaching the 2006 champions (the D.C. Divas) receives orders and is unable to complete the season. The Power warms up with a home pre-season game against the Nashville Dream, winning 37-12. Coach Smart takes the Power to a regular season 7-0 record before he has to pack up. Coach Mike Thomas (defensive coordinator) takes over as head coach and the transition is smooth. Coach Thomas' first official game as head coach is a victory and seals up an incredible record of 8-0 for the season outscoring opponents 480-10. The Power is now undefeated in regular season play for the third consecutive year.\n\nEntering the playoffs with an official Bye and home field advantage, the Power is ranked No. 1. The first match-up was against the Alabama Renegades. With a victory of 32-12, the Power advanced to play Oklahoma City Lightning. Again, the Power was successful with a victory of 26-14 and went on to the Championship in Nashville TN. Although the Power played a head to head game at Vanderbilt against the Detroit Demolition, Detroit made wise use of the clock and went on to win the Championship Title with a score of 28-21. The Power holds a record of 10-1 for the 2003 Season and are the reigning Gulf Coast Division Champions and Southern Conference Champions. For the 2003 season, the Power were rated #1 Defense and #2 Offense in the NWFA according to Massy Ratings. The franchise record stands at 27-3 (.894), not including pre-season scrimmages. The National Title has so far managed to slip out of their grasp, but the Power has without a doubt established themselves as a national contender.\n\nWith Coach Mike Thomas leading the way, the Power saw some new competition, as their favorite rival the Alabama Renegades were shifted into a different division. Although the games were tougher as the competition gets more experienced, the Power had their 4th consecutive 8-0 regular season. New playoff rules put into place made the scenario such that you must beat each opponent by more than 30 points to ultimately gain the home field advantage. Teams who were given forfeits automatically were credited with a 30-point spread win. Although 8-0 and outscoring their opponents 398-57, the Power lost the home field advantage, was seeded #3 and had to travel for 2 out of 3 playoff games. The Power breezed their way through the first round defeating the Ashville Assault 61-0. The team met the always competitive Chattanooga Locomotion in the next round. This was the first time the two teams had met again since the 2001 season. The game began slowly with both teams showing some strengths and weaknesses but the Power opened things up in the second half and defeated the Locomotion 35-20. The final playoff game and Southern Conference Championship was against the Lightning in Oklahoma City. The Power was disappointed as they weren't able to take the team to the final game with a loss to OKC. The franchise record after this season is 36-4 (.894) not including pre-season scrimmages.\n\nThis time, riding another 8-0 season, the Power beat OKC in overtime earning a third appearance at the Championships. They traveled to Louisville, Kentucky to play the Detroit Demolition for the NWFA Championship but they were literally out of their league as they were overpowered by a painful 74-0 loss.\n\nLimping home after their loss, the Power never quite recovered and suffered their first regular season loss in the franchise history to the Austin Outlaws. They ended the 2006 season 6-2 but still captured their Southeast Division Title. The Power were beaten by the Columbus Comets in the 2nd round of playoffs to end their 2006 season.\n\nDespite capturing a 7-1 record and another Southeast Division Title, the Power were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Columbus Comets once again.\n\nOnce again, the Power finished 6-2 and won the Southeast Division championship. Likewise, the Power were eliminated in the first round, losing 6-0 to the Kentucky Karma.\n\nFor the 2009 season, the Power moved to the Women's Football Alliance and changed their name to the Gulf Coast Riptide. Despite another well-played season and another 6-2 record, for the first time in franchise history, the Riptide missed the playoffs. This is because of the WFA's new playoff system which did not allow for any wildcards from the American Conference and because of the Riptide's two losses to the Jacksonville Dixie Blues.\n\nThe Riptide took the 2010 season off to reorganize.\n\nThe 2011 season continued the downfall of their previous season. For only the second time in team history, the Riptide failed to win the division title or play any postseason games; also for the first time in team history, the team finished with a losing record at 3-5.\n\n!Totals || 76 || 23 || 0\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> = current standing\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> = Won by forfeit\n\n"}

He took the \"Jeopardy\" test four times (in 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990) before being called to the show as an alternate in March 1991. He was not used in any of that day's tapings, but he did return the next year, and became a five-day champion, with winnings totaling $96,801, second to Frank Spangenberg's $102,597.

{"id": "1918627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918627", "title": "Jaqaru language", "text": "Jaqaru language\n\nJaqaru (\"Haq'aru\") is a language of the Aymaran family. It is also known as Jaqi and Aru. It is spoken in the districts of Tupe and Catahuasi in Yauyos Province, Lima Region, Peru. Most of the 2000 ethnic Jaqaru have migrated to Lima.\n\nKawki, a divergent dialect, is spoken in the nearby communities of Cachuy, Canchán, Caipán and Chavín by a few elderly individuals (9 surviving in early 2005). Hardman has noted that while Jaqaru and Kawki share a degree of mutual intelligibility, speakers of one were unable to understand tape recordings of the other, and in a few cases of marriage between Kawki and Jaqaru speakers, the home language was Spanish. (However, the home language of most Jaqaru and Kawki is now Spanish.) Historical analysis shows that the two languages were out of contact for a period. The name Tupe is used for Jaqaru and Kawki together. \n\nThere exist clear differences between Jaqaru and Kawki in regard to morphology. Jaqaru has ten verb persons, whereas Kawki has only nine (due to a case of homophony wherein Kawki maintained the semantic distinction between two different person markers, but lost the form distinction between the two). Additionally, regressive vowel harmony is present throughout the verb person system in Jaqaru, but does not appear in Kawki. Phonologically, Kawki is differentiated from Jaqaru in its vowel system. Jaqaru contains six vowels- three of regular length and three short, whereas Kawki has only the three regular-length vowels.\n\nJaqaru has three phonemic vowels , which distinguish two degrees of length. Long vowels are indicated in writing as follows: /a: i: u:/. \n\nSyntax in Jaqaru consists mainly of a system of sentence suffixes. These suffixes indicate sentence type (interrogative, declarative, etc.) Suffixes can and often do occur more than one per sentence, marking sentence type and creating complex constructions. Simply put, for sentences to be grammatical in Jaqaru, they must be inflected. Morphological words and syntactic phrases which do not contain a sentence suffix are judged by native speakers to be ungrammatical and for some, impossible to say (Hardman, 2000).\n\nSentence suffixes occur after all other morphological processes and can occur on any morphological words or syntactic phrases. The nature of sentence suffixes allows for freedom of word order and creativity in sentence construction, useful to storytellers (Hardman, 2000).\n\nThere are seven classes of sentence suffixes in Jaqaru, listed below:\n\nOrder classes of sentence suffixes (Hardman, 2000: 92)\n\n\nThese suffixes can occur in combination on words and most Class I suffixes rarely appear without another suffix on a morphological word. Classes II, III, and IV occur most frequently and are considered the core of syntactic inflection. It is theoretically possible for all sentence suffixes to occur in a sentence, but no case has ever been found. At most three or four sentence suffixes have been found in a text, as of the year 2000. However, because many morphological suffixes can also be stacked, syntactic words frequently carry up to seven or eight suffixes (Hardman, 2000).\n\nUnlike sentence word order, within phrases a fixed word order is either preferred or obligatory. Two main types of phrases occur in Jaqaru: noun phrases and verb phrases.\n\nNoun Phrases. There are three types of noun phrases: modifier phrases, number phrases, and possessive phrases. Modifier phrases consist of a head noun preceded by a one or more modifier noun, which is marked by vowel dropping. Numbers in Jaqaru are on a base ten scale. Number phrases are carefully ordered to build larger numbers using multipliers of 10, 100, and 1000. The number phrase order is: number x multiplier + number. Neutral, unmarked possessive phrases follow a specific order: possessor + -na + possessed + one of the four personal possessive suffixes (Hardman, 2000).\nVerb Phrases. Verb phrases in Jaqaru are rare and never consist of more than two parts. There are four fixed order types: the careful phrase, the facultative phrase, the effort phrase, and the OV phrase (vowel-drop modifier + verb root). Verbs can additionally be modified by a quantifier modifier (Hardman, 2000).\n\nThere are three types of particles in Jaqaru: negatives, greetings, and a few special ones. Three particles are used for negation: imperative negative, principle negative, and subordinate negative. Four greetings are used in Jaqaru for addressing people, which mark the sex of the speaker and the addressee and do not carry any suffixes of any kind. Four special particles take no suffixes and comprise utterances in and of themselves: Jira (“Let’s go”), Jalli (“I don’t know, could be.”), Wala (“Go on, get going, bye.”), and Chiku (“I’m going, I’m off, bye.”) (Hardman, 2000: 115).\n\nJaqaru morphology is extremely complex. Most of the grammatical information in Jaqaru is carried in the morphology. The basic person system consists of four persons. In the verb system, these four persons are expanded into a conjugation of ten grammatical person markers, each marking both subject and object in a single suffix. Also characteristic of the Jaqaru morphology (and all of the Jaqi languages) is the use of extensive vowel dropping for grammatical marking. The rules constraining vowel dropping are extensive, and can be conditioned by such things as morpheme identity, morpheme sequence, syntactic requirements, some phonological requirements and suffix requirements. (Hardman, 2000).\n\nThe primary form classes are root and suffix. Root classes are verb, noun, and particle; suffix classes are nominal, verbal, thematic, and sentence.\n\nEvidentiality marking is reflected in every sentence of the language. The three major grammatical categories of evidentiality are:\n\n1. personal knowledge (PK)--typically referring to sight\n\n2. knowledge-through-language (KTW)--referring to all that is learned by hearing others speak and by reading\n\n3. non-personal-knowledge (NPK)--used for all myths, histories from longer ago than any living memory, stories, and non-involvement of the speaker in the current situation (Hardman, 2000)\n\nNominal morphology involves suffixes, with two kinds of nominal suffixes: possession and modification. Noun suffixes consist of two types. One set involves the interplay of nouns with the rest of the sentence (there are 10 of these suffixes: 4 possessives, 5 directionals, and 1 object marker). All other nominal suffixes function to create complex nouns (Hardman, 2000).\n\nNominal morphology is based on a four-person paradigm which marks the relationship of the second person to the utterance. Therefore, the first person excludes the addressee. Second person excludes the speaker. Third person excludes both the speaker and the addressee, and is used for unmarked or null instances. Fourth person marks the inclusion of both the speaker and the addressee (Hardman, 2000).\n\nVerbal morphology in Jaqaru is extremely complex, in both inflections and derivations. A great deal of the grammatical work of the language is done within the verbal morphological system. The standard paradigm is of ten persons, which define the relationships between the four basic persons (Hardman, 2000, 56):\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Jaqaru (and all other Jaqi languages), the tie between object and subject is one of union; they are not separable morphologically, and conjugation requires simultaneous specification of both as a unit. Verbs are conjugated in two sets: one for principal clauses with ten tenses and one for subordinate clauses with twelve tenses. Verbs ordinarily consist of a minimum of three morphemes. However, typical verbs consist of many more (Hardman, 2000).\n\n\n\n"}

There were an estimated 1 million Rohingya living in Myanmar before the 2016–17 crisis. Described by the United Nations in 2013 as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world, the Rohingya population is denied citizenship under the 1982 Myanmar nationality law. They are also restricted from freedom of movement, state education and civil service jobs. The legal conditions faced by the Rohingya in Myanmar have been widely compared to apartheid by many international academics, analysts and political figures, including Nobel laureate Bishop Desmond Tutu, a South African anti-apartheid activist.\n\nThe Rohingya maintain they are indigenous to western Myanmar with a heritage of over a millennium and influence from the Arabs, Mughals and Portuguese. The community claims it is descended from people in precolonial Arakan and colonial Arakan; historically, the region was an independent kingdom between Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The position of the Myanmar government is that Rohingyas are not a national \"indigenous race\", but are illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. It argues that the Muslims of precolonial times are now recognized as Kameins and that the Rohingya conflate their history with the history of all Muslims in Arakan to advance a separatist agenda. In addition, Myanmar's government does not recognize the term \"Rohingya\" and prefers to refer to the community as \"Bangali\" in a pejorative manner. Rohingya campaign groups, notably the Arakan Rohingya National Organization, demand the right to \"self-determination within Myanmar\".\n\nVarious armed insurrections by the Rohingya have taken place since the 1940s and the population as a whole has faced military crackdowns in 1978, 1991–1992, 2012, 2015, 2016–2017 and particularly in 2017–2018, when most of the Rohingya population of Myanmar was driven out of the country, into neighboring Bangladesh. By December 2017, an estimated 625,000 refugees from Rakhine, Myanmar, had crossed the border into Bangladesh since August 2017. UN officials and Human Rights Watch have described Myanmar's persecution of the Rohingya as ethnic cleansing. The UN human rights envoy to Myanmar reported \"the long history of discrimination and persecution against the Rohingya community... could amount to crimes against humanity\", and there have been warnings of an unfolding genocide. Probes by the UN have found evidence of increasing incitement of hatred and religious intolerance by \"ultra-nationalist Buddhists\" against Rohingyas while the Myanmar security forces have been conducting \"summary executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and ill-treatment, and forced labour\" against the community.\n\nBefore the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis and the military crackdown in 2016 and 2017, the Rohingya population in Myanmar was around 1.0 to 1.3 million, chiefly in the northern Rakhine townships, which were 80–98% Rohingya. Since 2015, over 900,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to south-eastern Bangladesh alone, and more to other surrounding countries, and major Muslim nations. More than 100,000 Rohingyas in Myanmar are confined in camps for internally displaced persons. Shortly before a Rohingya rebel attack that killed 12 security forces on 25 August 2017, the Myanmar military launched \"clearance operations\" against the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state that, according to NGOs, the Bangladeshi government and international news media, left many dead, many more injured, tortured or raped, with villages burned. The government of Myanmar has denied the allegations.\n\nThe modern term Rohingya emerged from colonial and pre-colonial terms \"Rooinga\" and \"Rwangya\". The Rohingya refer to themselves as \"Ruáingga\" . In Burmese they are known as \"rui hang gya\" (following the MLC Transcription System) ( ) while in Bengali they are called \"Rohingga\" ( ). The term \"Rohingya\" may come from \"Rakhanga\" or \"Roshanga\", the words for the state of Arakan. The word \"Rohingya\" would then mean \"inhabitant of Rohang\", which was the early Muslim name for Arakan.\n\nThe usage of the term \"Rohingya\" has been historically documented prior to the British Raj. In 1799, Francis Buchanan wrote an article called \"A Comparative Vocabulary of Some of the Languages Spoken in the Burma Empire\", which was found and republished by Michael Charney in the \"SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research\" in 2003. Among the native groups of Arakan, he wrote are the: \"\"Mohammedans\", who have long settled in \"Arakan\", and who call themselves \"Rooinga\", or natives of \"Arakan\".\" The \"Classical Journal\" of 1811 identified \"Rooinga\" as one of the languages spoken in the \"Burmah Empire\". In 1815, Johann Severin Vater listed \"Ruinga\" as an ethnic group with a distinct language in a compendium of languages published in German.\n\nIn 1936, when Burma was still under British rule, the \"\"Rohingya Jam’iyyat al Ulama\"\" was founded in Arakan.\n\nAccording to Jacques Leider, the Rohingya were referred to as \"Chittagonians\" during the British colonial period, and it was not controversial to refer to them as \"Bengalis\" until the 1990s. Leider also states that \"there is no international consensus\" on the use of the term Rohingya, as they are often called \"Rohingya Muslims\", \"Muslim Arakanese\" and \"Burmese Muslims\". Others, such as anthropologist Christina Fink, use Rohingya not as an ethnic identifier but as a political one. Leider believes the Rohingya is a political movement that started in the 1950s to create \"an autonomous Muslim zone\" in Rakhine.\n\nThe government of Prime Minister U Nu, when Burma was a democracy from 1948–1962, used the term \"Rohingya\" in radio addresses as a part of peace-building effort in Mayu Frontier Region. The term was broadcast on Burmese radio and was used in the speeches of Burmese rulers. A UNHCR report on refugees caused by Operation King Dragon referred to the victims as \"Bengali Muslims (called Rohingyas)\". Nevertheless, the term \"Rohingya\" wasn't widely used until the 1990s.\n\nToday the use of the name \"Rohingya\" is polarized. The government of Myanmar refuses to use the name. In the 2014 census, the Myanmar government forced the Rohingya to identify themselves as \"Bengali\". Many Rohingya see the denial of their name similar to denying their basic rights, and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar has agreed. Jacques Leider writes that many Muslims in Rakhine simply prefer to call themselves \"Muslim Arakanese\" or \"Muslims coming from Rakhine\" instead of \"Rohingya\". The United States embassy in Yangon continues to use the name \"Rohingya\".\n\nThe Rohingya population is concentrated in the historical region of Arakan, an old coastal country in Southeast Asia.\nIt is not clear who the original settlers of Arakan were. Arkanese chronicles claim that the Rakhine have inhabited Arakan since 3000 BCE. By the 4th century, Arakan became one of the earliest Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia. The first Arakanese state flourished in Dhanyawadi. Power then shifted to the city of Waithali. Sanskrit inscriptions in the region indicate that the founders of the first Arakanese states were Indian. Arakan was ruled by the Chandra dynasty. The British historian Daniel George Edward Hall stated that \"The Burmese do not seem to have settled in Arakan until possibly as late as the tenth century CE. Hence earlier dynasties are thought to have been Indian, ruling over a population similar to that of Bengal. All the capitals known to history have been in the north near modern Akyab\".\n\nDue to its coastline on the Bay of Bengal, Arakan was a key centre of maritime trade and cultural exchange between Burma and the outside world, since the time of the Indian Mauryan Empire. According to Syed Islam, a political science scholar, Arab merchants had been in contact with Arakan since the third century, using the Bay of Bengal to reach Arakan. A southern branch of the Silk Road connected India, Burma, and China since the neolithic period. Arab traders are recorded in the coastal areas of southeast Bengal, bordering Arakan, since the 9th century. The Rohingya population trace their history to this period.\n\nAccording to Syed Islam, the earliest Muslim settlements in the Arakan region began in the 7th-century. The Arab traders were also missionaries and they began converting the local Buddhist population to Islam by about 788 CE, states Syed Islam. Besides these locals converting to Islam, Arab merchants married local women and later settled in Arakan. As a result of intermarriage and conversion, the Muslim population in Arakan grew.\n\nThe alternate view contests that Islam arrived in the Arakan region in the 1st-millennium. According to this view, this Rohingya history is not based on any evidence, rather is based on \"fictitious stories, myths and legends\". According to Southeast Asian Buddhism history scholar and an ordained Buddhist monk Ashon Nyanuttara, there is scant historical data and archeological evidence about the early political and religious history of the Arakan people and the Rakhaing region. The limited evidence available suggests that Buddhism, possibly the Mahayana tradition, was well established by the 4th-century in the region under the Candra Buddhist dynasty. Muslim community's expansion and the growth of Islam into the region came much later with Bengali Muslims from the region that is now a part of Bangladesh. Further, the term \"Rohingya\" does not appear in any regional text of this period and much later. That term was adopted by \"a few Bengali Muslim intellectuals who were direct descendants of immigrants from Chittagong district [Bengal]\" in the 20th-century, states historian Aye Chan.\n\nThe Rakhines were one of the tribes of the Burmese Pyu city-states. The Rakhines began migrating to Arakan through the Arakan Mountains in the 9th century. The Rakhines established numerous cities in the valley of the Lemro River. These included Sambawak I, Pyinsa, Parein, Hkrit, Sambawak II, Myohaung, Toungoo and Launggret. Burmese forces invaded the Rakhine cities in 1406. The Burmese invasion forced Rakhine rulers to seek help and refuge from neighbouring Bengal in the north.\n\nEarly evidence of Bengali Muslim settlements in Arakan date back to the time of Min Saw Mon (1430–34) of the Kingdom of Mrauk U. After 24 years of exile in Bengal, he regained control of the Arakanese throne in 1430 with military assistance from the Bengal Sultanate. The Bengalis who came with him formed their own settlements in the region. The Santikan Mosque built in the 1430s, features a court which \"measures from north to south and from east to west; the shrine is a rectangular structure measuring .\"\n\nKing Min Saw Mon ceded some territory to the Sultan of Bengal and recognised his sovereignty over the areas. In recognition of his kingdom's vassal status, the Buddhist kings of Arakan received Islamic titles and used the Bengali gold dinar within the kingdom. Min Saw Mon minted his own coins with the Burmese alphabet on one side and the Persian alphabet on the other.\n\nArakan's vassalage to Bengal was brief. After Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah's death in 1433, Narameikhla's successors invaded Bengal and occupied Ramu in 1437 and Chittagong in 1459. Arakan would hold Chittagong until 1666.\n\nEven after independence from the Sultans of Bengal, the Arakanese kings continued the custom of maintaining Muslim titles. The Buddhist kings compared themselves to Sultans and fashioned themselves after Mughal rulers. They also continued to employ Muslims in prestigious positions within the royal administration. Some of them worked as Bengali, Persian and Arabic scribes in the Arakanese courts, which, despite remaining Buddhist, adopted Islamic fashions from the neighbouring Bengal Sultanate.\n\nThe population increased in the 17th century, as slaves were brought in by Arakanese raiders and Portuguese settlers following raids into Bengal. Slaves included members of the Mughal nobility. A notable royal slave was Alaol, a renowned poet in the Arakanese court. The slave population were employed in a variety of workforces, including in the king's army, commerce and agriculture.\n\nIn 1660, Prince Shah Shuja, the governor of Mughal Bengal and a claimant of the Peacock Throne, fled to Arakan with his family after being defeated by his brother Emperor Aurangzeb during the Battle of Khajwa. Shuja and his entourage arrived in Arakan on 26 August 1660. He was granted asylum by King Sanda Thudhamma. In December 1660, the Arakanese king confiscated Shuja's gold and jewelry, leading to an insurrection by the royal Mughal refugees. According to varying accounts, Shuja's family was killed by the Arakanese, while Shuja himself may have fled to a kingdom in Manipur. However, members of Shuja's entourage remained in Arakan and were recruited by the royal army, including as archers and court guards. They were king makers in Arakan until the Burmese conquest. The Arakanese continued their raids of Mughal Bengal. Dhaka was raided in 1625.\n\nEmperor Aurangzeb gave orders to his governor in Mughal Bengal, Shaista Khan, to end what the Mughals saw as Arakanese-Portuguese piracy. In 1666, Shaista Khan led a army and 288 warships to seize Chittagong from the Kingdom of Mrauk U. The Mughal expedition continued up till the Kaladan River. The Mughals placed the northern part of Arakan under its administration and vassalage. The Muslim population became concentrated in northern Arakan. In 1960, Burmese cabinet minister Sultan Mahmud cited the Kaladan River as the boundary between Rohingya and Rakhine areas.\n\nFollowing the Konbaung Dynasty's conquest of Arakan in 1785, as many as 35,000 people of the Rakhine State fled to the neighbouring Chittagong region of British Bengal in 1799 to escape persecution by the Bamar and to seek protection under the British Raj. The Bamar executed thousands of men and deported a considerable portion of people from Rakhine population to central Burma, leaving Arakan a scarcely populated area by the time the British occupied it.\n\nAccording to an article on the \"\"Burma\" Empire\" published by the British Francis Buchanan-Hamilton in 1799, \"the \"Mohammedans\", who have long settled in \"Arakan\"\", \"call themselves \"Rooinga\", or natives of \"Arakan\"\". However, according to Derek Tokin, Hamilton no longer used the term to refer to the Muslims in Arakan in his later publications. Sir Henry Yule saw many Muslims serving as eunuchs in Konbaung while on a diplomatic mission to the Burmese capital, Ava.\n\nBritish policy encouraged Bengali inhabitants from adjacent regions to migrate into the then lightly populated and fertile valleys of Arakan as farm labourers. The East India Company extended the Bengal Presidency to Arakan. There was no international boundary between Bengal and Arakan and no restrictions on migration between the regions. In the early 19th century, thousands of Bengalis from the Chittagong region settled in Arakan seeking work. It is hard to know whether these new Bengal migrants were the same population that was deported by force to Bengal's Chittagong during the Burmese conquest in the 18th century and later returned to Arakan as a result of British policy or they were a new migrant population with no ancestral roots to Arakan.\n\nThe British census of 1872 reported 58,255 Muslims in Akyab District. By 1911, the Muslim population had increased to 178,647. The waves of migration were primarily due to the requirement of cheap labour from British India to work in the paddy fields. Immigrants from Bengal, mainly from the Chittagong region, \"moved en masse into western townships of Arakan\". Albeit Indian immigration to Burma was a nationwide phenomenon, not just restricted to Arakan. For these reasons historians believed that most Rohingyas arrived with the British colonialists in the 19th and 20th centuries with some tracing their ancestry much further.\n\nAccording to Thant Myint-U, historian and adviser to President Thein Sein, \"At the beginning of the 20th century, Indians were arriving in Burma at the rate of no less than a quarter million per year. The numbers rose steadily until the peak year of 1927, immigration reached 480,000 people, with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration port in the world. This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year.\" By then, in most of the largest cities in Burma, Rangoon, Akyab, Bassein and Moulmein, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population. All of Burma was officially a Province within the British Indian Empire ('the Raj') from November 1885 until 1937, when Burma became a separate Crown colony within the British Empire. The Burmese under British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a \"racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear\". Professor Andrew Selth of Griffith University writes that although a few Rohingya trace their ancestry to Muslims who lived in Arakan in the 15th and 16h centuries, most Rohingyas arrived with the British colonialists in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe impact of this immigration was particularly acute in Arakan. Although it boosted the colonial economy, local Arakanese bitterly resented it. According to historian Clive J. Christie, \"The issue became a focus for grass-roots Burmese nationalism, and in the years 1930–31 there were serious anti-Indian disturbances in Lower Burma, while 1938 saw riots specifically directed against the Indian Muslim community. As Burmese nationalism increasingly asserted itself before the Second World War, the 'alien' Indian presence inevitably came under attack, along with the religion that the Indian Muslims imported. The Muslims of northern Arakan were to be caught in the crossfire of this conflict.\"\n\nIn the 1931 census, the Muslim population of Burma was 584,839, 4% of the total population of 14,647,470 at the time. 396,504 were Indian Muslims and 1,474 Chinese Muslims, while 186,861 were Burmese Muslims. The census found a growth in the number of Indian Muslims born in Burma, primarily due to their permanent settlement in Akyab. 41% of Muslims of Burma lived in Arakan at that time.\n\nDue to the terrain of the Arakan Mountains, the Arakan region was mostly accessible by sea. In British Arakan Division, the port of Akyab had ferry services and a thriving trade with the ports of Chittagong, Narayanganj, Dacca and Calcutta in British India; as well as with Rangoon. Akyab was one of the leading rice ports in the world, hosting ship fleets from Europe and China. Many Indians settled in Akyab and dominated its seaport and hinterland. The 1931 census found 500,000 Indians living in Akyab.\n\nSeveral Rohingyas were elected to Burmese native seats in the Legislative Council of Burma and Legislature of Burma. During the 1936 Burmese general election, Advocate U Pho Khaine was elected from Akyab West and Gani Markan was elected from Maungdaw-Buthidaung. In 1939, U Tanvy Markan was elected from Maungdaw-Buthidaung.\n\nTheir elections in the Burmese native category set them apart from immigrant Indian legislators.\n\nDuring World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) invaded British-controlled Burma. The British forces retreated and in the power vacuum left behind, considerable inter-communal violence erupted between Arakanese and Muslim villagers. The British armed Muslims in northern Arakan in order to create a buffer zone that would protect the region from a Japanese invasion when they retreated and to counteract the largely pro-Japanese ethnic Rakhines. The period also witnessed violence between groups loyal to the British and the Burmese nationalists. The Arakan massacres in 1942 involved communal violence between British-armed V Force Rohingya recruits and , polarizing the region along ethnic lines.\n\nTensions boiling in Arakan before the war erupted during the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia and Arakan became the frontline in the conflict. The war resulted in a complete breakdown of civil administration and consequent development of habits of lawlessness exacerbated by the availability of modern firearms. The Japanese advance triggered an inter-communal conflict between Muslims and Buddhists. The Muslims fled towards British-controlled Muslim-dominated northern Arakan from Japanese-controlled Buddhist-majority areas. This stimulated a \"reverse ethnic cleansing\" in British-controlled areas, particularly around Maungdaw. Failure of a British counter-offensive, attempted from December 1942 to April 1943, resulted in the abandonment of even more of the Muslim population as well as an increase in inter-communal violence.\n\nMoshe Yegar, a research fellow at Truman Institute, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, noted that hostility had developed between the Muslims and the Buddhists who had brought about a similar hostility in other parts of Burma. This tension was let loose with the retreat of the British. With the approach of the Japanese into Arakan, the Buddhists instigated cruel measures against the Muslims. Thousands, though the exact number is unknown, fled from Buddhist-majority regions to eastern Bengal and northern Arakan with many being killed or dying of starvation. The Muslims in response conducted retaliatory raids from British-controlled areas, causing Buddhists to flee to southern Arakan.\n\nAye Chan, a historian at Kanda University in Japan, has written that as a consequence of acquiring arms from the British during World War II, Rohingyas tried to destroy the Arakanese villages instead of resisting the Japanese. Chan agrees that hundreds of Muslims fled to northern Arakan, though states that the accounts of atrocities on them were exaggerated. In March 1942, Rohingyas from northern Arakan killed around 20,000 Arakanese. In return, around 5,000 Muslims in the Minbya and Mrauk-U Townships were killed by Rakhines and Red Karens.\n\nAs in the rest of Burma, the IJA committed acts of rape, murder and torture against Muslims in Arakan. During this period, some 22,000 Muslims in Arakan were believed to have crossed the border into Bengal, then part of British India, to escape the violence. The exodus was not restricted to Muslims in Arakan. Thousands of Burmese Indians, Anglo-Burmese and British who settled during the colonial period emigrated \"en masse\" to India.\n\nTo facilitate their reentry into Burma, the British formed Volunteer Forces with Rohingya. Over the three years during which the Allies and Japanese fought over the Mayu peninsula, the Rohingya recruits of the V-Force, engaged in a campaign against Arakanese communities, using weapons provided by V-Force. According to the secretary of the British governor, the V Force, instead of fighting the Japanese, destroyed Buddhist monasteries, pagodas, and houses, and committed atrocities in northern Arakan. The British Army's liaison officer, Anthony Irwin, on the other hand, praised the role of the V Force.\n\nDuring the Pakistan Movement in the 1940s, Rohingya Muslims in western Burma organized a separatist movement to merge the region into East Pakistan. The commitments of the British regarding the status of Muslims after the war are not clear. V Force officers like Andrew Irwin felt that Muslims along with other minorities must be rewarded for their loyalty. Muslim leaders believed that the British had promised them a \"Muslim National Area\" in Maungdaw region. They were also apprehensive of a future Buddhist-dominated government. In 1946, calls were made for annexation of the territory by Pakistan as well as of an independent state. Before the independence of Burma in January 1948, Muslim leaders from Arakan addressed themselves to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and asked his assistance in incorporating the Mayu region to Pakistan considering their religious affinity and geographical proximity with East Pakistan. The North Arakan Muslim League was founded in Akyab (modern Sittwe) two months later. The proposal never materialized since it was reportedly turned down by Jinnah, saying that he was not in a position to interfere in Burmese matters.\n\nThe numbers and the extent of post-independence immigration from Bangladesh are subject to controversy and debate. In a 1955 study published by Stanford University, the authors Virginia Thompson and Richard Adloff write, \"The post-war (World War II) illegal immigration of Chittagonians into that area was on a vast scale, and in the Maungdaw and Buthidaung areas they replaced the Arakanese.\" The authors further argue that the term \"Rohingya, \"in the form of \"Rwangya, \"first appeared to distinguish settled population from newcomers: \"The newcomers were called Mujahids (crusaders), in contrast to the Rwangya or settled Chittagonian population.\" According to the International Crisis Group (ICG), these immigrants were actually the Rohingyas who were displaced by World War II and began to return to Arakan after the independence of Burma but were rendered as illegal immigrants, while many were not allowed to return. ICG adds that there were \"some 17,000\" refugees from the Bangladesh liberation war who \"subsequently returned home\".\n\nOn 25 September 1954, the then Prime Minister U Nu in his radio address to the nation talked about Rohingya Muslims’ political loyalty to predominantly Buddhist Burma. This usage of the term ‘Rohingya’ is important in the sense that today Myanmar denies to accept this category altogether and calls them ’Bengali’. During the same time a separate administrative zone May Yu was established comprising most of the present North Rakhine State, which had Rohingya as its majority ethnic group. One of the objectives of this Muslim majority zone was to ‘strive for peace with Pakistan’. Brigadier Aung Gyi, one of the deputies of General Ne Win, in 1961 explained Rohingya as; “On the west, May Yu district borders with Pakistan. As is the case with all borderlands communities, there are Muslims on both sides of the borders. Those who are on Pakistan’s side are known as Pakistani while the Muslims on our Burmese side of the borders are referred to as ‘Rohingya’. But since Burma's military junta took control of the country in 1962, the Rohingya have been systematically deprived of their political rights. In 1962 military dictator General Ne Win, took over the government and started implementing a Nationalist agenda, which had its roots in racial discrimination. In 1978 military government launched operation Nagamin to separate nationals from non-nationals. This was the first concerted large scale violent attack on Rohingya. National Registration Cards (NRC) were taken away by state actors never to be replaced. Violence that followed forced 200,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. Bangladesh denied Rohingya admission into her territory and blocked food rations leading to death of 12,000 of them. After bilateral negotiations Rohingya were repatriated.\n\nIn the prelude to independence, two Rohingyas were elected to the Constituent Assembly of Burma in 1947, M. A. Gaffar and Sultan Ahmed. After Burma became independent in 1948, M. A. Gaffar presented a memorandum of appeal to the Government of the Union of Burma calling for the recognition of the term \"Rohingya\", based on local Indian names of Arakan (Rohan and Rohang), as the official name of the ethnicity. Sultan Ahmed, who served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Minorities, was a member of the Justice Sir Ba U Commission charged with exploring whether Arakan Division should be granted statehood. During the 1951 Burmese general election, five Rohingyas were elected to the Parliament of Burma, including one of the country's first two female MPs, Zura Begum. Six MPs were elected during the 1956 Burmese general election and subsequent by-elections. Sultan Mahmud, a former politician in British India, became Minister of Health in the cabinet of Prime Minister of Burma U Nu. In 1960, Mahmud suggested that either Rohingya-majority northern Arakan remain under the central government or be made a separate province. However, during the 1960 Burmese general election, Prime Minister U Nu's pledges included making all of Arakan into one province. The 1962 Burmese coup d'état ended the country's Westminster-style political system. The 1982 Burmese citizenship law stripped most of the Rohingyas of their stake in citizenship.\n\nRohingya community leaders were supportive of the 8888 uprising for democracy. During the 1990 Burmese general election, the Rohingya-led National Democratic Party for Human Rights won four seats in the Burmese parliament. The four Rohingya MPs included Shamsul Anwarul Huq, Chit Lwin Ebrahim, Fazal Ahmed and Nur Ahmed. The election was won by the National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who was placed under house arrest and not permitted to become prime minister. The Burmese military junta banned the National Democratic Party for Human Rights in 1992. Its leaders were arrested, jailed and tortured.\n\nRohingya politicians have been jailed to disbar them from contesting elections. In 2005, Shamsul Anwarul Huq was charged under Section 18 of the controversial 1982 Burmese citizenship law and sentenced to 47 years in prison. In 2015, a ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party MP Shwe Maung was disbarred from the 2015 Burmese general election, on grounds that his parents were not Burmese citizens under the 1982 citizenship law.\n\nAs of 2017, Burma does not have a single Rohingya MP and the Rohingya population have no voting rights.\n\nA separate administrative zone for the Rohingya-majority northern areas of Arakan existed between 1961 and 1964. Known as the Mayu Frontier District, the zone was set up by Prime Minister U Nu after the 1960 Burmese general election, on the advice of his health minister Sultan Mahmud. The zone was administered directly from Rangoon by the national government. After the Burmese military coup in 1962, the zone was administered by the Burmese army. It was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1964 by the Union Revolutionary Council. The socialist military government inducted the zone into Arakan State in 1974.\n\nRacism towards people with links to the Indian subcontinent increased after the 1962 Burmese coup. The socialist military government nationalized all property, including many enterprises of the white collar Burmese Indian community. Between 1962 and 1964, 320,000 Burmese Indians were forced to leave the country.\n\nAs a result of Operation King Dragon by the Burmese junta, the first wave of Rohingya refugees entered Bangladesh in 1978. An estimated 200,000 Rohingyas took shelter in Cox's Bazaar. Diplomatic initiatives over 16 months resulted in a repatriation agreement, which allowed the return of most refugees under a process facilitated by UNHCR. The return of refugees to Burma has been the second largest repatriation process in Asia after the return of Cambodian refugees from Thailand.\n\nIn 1982, the citizenship law enacted by the Burmese military junta did not list the Rohingya as one of the 135 \"national races\" of Burma. This made much of the Rohingya population in Burma stateless in their historical homeland of Arakan. General Ne Win drafted Citizenship Act in 1982, which denied citizenship rights to any community/group that was not listed in a survey conducted by British in 1824. All other ethnic groups were considered aliens to the land or invaders. Eight major ethnicities Arakan, Chin, Kachin, Karen, Kayah, Mon, Shan, and Burmese were broken into 135 small ethnic groups. Groups like Rohingya who do not belong to any of these 135 ethnicities were denied citizenship rights. Taking into account just one survey for defining the history of a group of people is highly problematic. It overlooks the fact that Rohingya were mentioned in records earlier to this survey.\n\nScholars like Maung Zarni have argued that Burmese military ‘encoded its anti-Indian and anti-Muslim racism in its laws and policies’. He further argues;\n\n“The 1982 Citizenship Act serves as the state’s legal and ideological foundation on which all forms of violence, execution, restrictions, and human rights crimes are justified and committed with state impunity if carried out horizontally by the local ultra-nationalist Rakhine Buddhists.\n\nIn light of the on-the-ground link between the legalized removal of citizenship from the Rohingya and the implementation of a permanent set of draconian laws and policies—as opposed to periodic “anti-immigration” operations—amount to the infliction on the Rohingya of conditions of life designed to bring about serious bodily and mental harm and to destroy the group in whole or in part. As such, the illegalization of the Rohingya in Myanmar is an indication of the intent of the State to both remove the Rohingya permanently from their homeland and to destroy the Rohingya as a group.”\n\nAfter Burmese military junta began persecuting the political opposition following Aung San Suu Kyi's victory in the 1990 election and the earlier 1988 Uprising, military operations targeting Muslims (who strongly favored the pro-democracy movement) began in Arakan State. The Rohingya-led NDPHR political party was banned and its leaders were jailed. Suu Kyi herself was placed under house arrest by the junta led by General Than Shwe.\n\nAs the Burmese military increased its operations across the country, the Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung townships in northern Arakan became centers of persecution. The 23rd and 24th regiments of the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Army) were responsible for promoting forced labour, rape, the confiscation of houses, land and farm animals, the destruction of mosques, a ban on religious activities and the harassment of the religious priests. An estimated 250,000 refugees crossed over into Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, the refugee influx was a challenge for the newly elected government of the country's first female prime minister Khaleda Zia (who headed the first parliamentary government since 1975). Both Bangladesh and Burma mobilized thousands of troops along the border during the crisis. The government of Bangladesh emphasized a peaceful resolution of the crisis.\n\nAfter diplomatic negotiations, a repatriation agreement was put in place to allow the return of refugees to Burma under a UNHCR-supervised process.\n\nIn 1989, the junta officially changed the name of Burma to Myanmar. In the 1990s, the junta changed the name of the province of Arakan to Rakhine State, which showed a bias towards the Rakhine community, even though the Rohingya formed a substantial part of the population. The name of the region was historically known as Arakan for centuries.\n\nThe colloquial term \"Rohingya\" can be traced back to the pre-colonial period. The Rohingya community have also been known as Arakanese Indians and Arakanese Muslims. Since the 1982 citizenship law, Burmese juntas and governments have strongly objected to the usage of the term of Rohingya, preferring to label the community as \"illegal immigrants\". The derogatory slur \"kalar\" is widely used in Myanmar against the Rohingya. Myanmar's government has often pressured diplomats and foreign delegates against uttering the term \"Rohingya\".\n\nThe Rakhine for their part felt discriminated against by the governments in Rangoon dominated by the ethnic Burmese with one Rakhine politician saying, \"we are therefore the victims of Muslimisation and Burmese chauvinism.\" \"The Economist\" wrote in 2015 that from the 1940s on and right to this day, the Burmens have seen and see themselves as victims of the British Empire while the Rakhine see themselves as victims of the British and the Burmens; both groups were and are so intent upon seeing themselves as victims that neither has much sympathy for the Rohingyas.\n\nAfter Jinnah's refusal to accept northern Arakan into the Dominion of Pakistan, some Rohingya elders who supported a \"jihad\" movement, founded the \"Mujahid\" party in northern Arakan in 1947. The aim of the Mujahid party was to create an autonomous Islamic state in Arakan. By the 1950s, they began to use the term \"Rohingya\" which may be a continuation of the term Rooinga to establish a distinct identity and identify themselves as indigenous. They were much more active before the 1962 Burmese coup d'état by General Ne Win, a Burmese general who began his military career fighting for the Japanese in World War II. Ne Win carried out military operations against them over a period of two decades. The prominent one was Operation King Dragon, which took place in 1978; as a result, many Muslims in the region fled to neighboring Bangladesh as refugees. In addition to Bangladesh, a large number of Rohingyas also migrated to Karachi, Pakistan. Rohingya mujahideen are still active within the remote areas of Arakan.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1978, a number of Rakhine monks and Buddhists staged hunger strikes in Sittwe to force the government to tackle immigration issues which they believed to be causing a demographic shift in the region. Ne Win's government requested UN to repatriate the war refugees and launched military operations which drove off around 200,000 people to Bangladesh. In 1978, the Bangladesh government protested against the Burmese government concerning \"the expulsion by force of thousands of Burmese Muslim citizens to Bangladesh\". The Burmese government responded that those expelled were Bangladesh citizens who had resided illegally in Burma. In July 1978, after intensive negotiations mediated by UN, Ne Win's government agreed to take back 200,000 refugees who settled in Arakan. In the same year as well as in 1992, a joint statement by governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh \"acknowledged that the Rohingya were lawful Burmese residents\". In 1982, the Burmese government enacted the citizenship law and declared the \"Bengalis\" are foreigners.\n\nThere are widespread beliefs among Rakhine people that significant number of immigrants arrived even after the 1980s when the border was relatively unguarded. However, there is no documentation proof for these claims as the last census was conducted in 1983. Successive Burmese governments have fortified the border and built up border guard forces.\n\nSince the 1990s, a new 'Rohingya' movement which is distinct from the 1950s armed rebellion has emerged. The new movement is characterized by lobbying internationally by overseas diaspora, establishing indigenous claims by Rohingya scholars, publicizing the term \"Rohingya\" and denying Bengali origins by Rohingya politicians.\n\nRohingya scholars have claimed that Rakhine was previously an Islamic state for a millennium, or that Muslims were king-makers of Rakhine kings for 350 years. They often traced the origin of Rohingyas to Arab seafarers. These claims have been rejected as \"newly invented myths\" in academic circles. Some Rohingya politicians have labelled Burmese and international historians as \"Rakhine sympathizers\" for rejecting the purported historical origins.\n\nThe movement has garnered sharp criticisms from ethnic Rakhines and Kamans, the latter of whom are a recognized Muslim ethnic group in Rakhine. Kaman leaders support citizenship for Muslims in northern Rakhine but believe that the new movement is aimed at achieving a self-administered area or Rohang State as a separate Islamic state carved out of Rakhine, and condemn the movement.\n\nRakhines' views are more critical. Citing Bangladesh's overpopulation and density, Rakhines perceive the Rohingyas as \"the vanguard of an unstoppable wave of people that will inevitably engulf Rakhine\". However, for moderate Rohingyas, the aim may have been no more than to gain citizenship status. Moderate Rohingya politicians agree to compromise on the term Rohingya if citizenship is provided under an alternative identity that is neither \"Bengali\" nor \"Rohingya\". Various alternatives including \"Rakhine Muslims\", \"Myanmar Muslims\" or simply \"Myanmar\" have been proposed.\n\nThe military junta that ruled Myanmar for half a century relied heavily on mixing Burmese nationalism and Theravada Buddhism to bolster its rule, and, in the view of the US government, heavily discriminated against minorities like the Rohingyas. Some pro-democracy dissidents from Myanmar's ethnic Bamar majority do not consider the Rohingyas compatriots.\n\nSuccessive Burmese governments have been accused of provoking riots led by Buddhist monks against ethnic minorities like the Rohingyas In the 1990s, more than 250,000 Rohingya fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh. In the early 2000s, all but 20,000 of them were repatriated to Myanmar, some against their will. In 2009, a senior Burmese envoy to Hong Kong branded the Rohingyas \"ugly as ogres\" and a people that are alien to Myanmar.\n\nUnder the 2008 constitution, the Myanmar military still control much of the country's government, including the ministries of home, defense and border affairs, 25% of seats in parliament and one vice president.\n\nThe 2012 Rakhine State riots were a series of conflicts between Rohingya Muslims who form the majority in the northern Rakhine and ethnic Rakhines who form the majority in the south. Before the riots, there were widespread fears among the Buddhist Rakhines that they would soon become a minority in their ancestral state. The riots occurred after weeks of sectarian disputes, including a gang rape and murder of a Rakhine woman by Rohingyas and killing of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines. There is evidence that the pogroms in 2012 were incited by the government asking the Rakhine men to defend their \"race and religion\". The Rakhine men were said to have been given knives and free food, and bused in from Sittwe. The Burmese government denied having organized the pogroms, but has never prosecuted anyone for the attacks against the Rohingyas. \"The Economist\" argued that since the transition to democracy in Burma in 2011, the military has been seeking to retain its privileged position, forming the motivation for it to encourage the riots in 2012 and allowing it to pose as the defender of Buddhism against Muslim Rohingya.\n\nOn both sides, entire villages were \"decimated\". According to the Burmese authorities, the violence between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and up to 140,000 people displaced. The government has responded by imposing curfews and deploying troops in the region. On 10 June 2012, a state of emergency was declared in Rakhine, allowing the military to participate in the administration of the region. Rohingya NGOs abroad have accused the Burmese army and police of targeting Rohingya Muslims through arrests and participating in violence.\n\nA field observation conducted by the International Crisis Group concluded that both communities were grateful for the protection provided by the military. A number of monks' organisations have taken measures to boycott NGOs which they believe helped only Rohingyas in the past decades even though Rakhines were equally poor. In July 2012, the Burmese Government did not include the Rohingya minority group in the census—classified as stateless Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982. About 140,000 Rohingya in Myanmar remain confined in IDP camps.\n\nIn 2015, the Simon-Skjodt Centre of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum stated in a press statement the Rohingyas are \"at grave risk of additional mass atrocities and even genocide\". In 2015, to escape violence and persecution, thousands of Rohingyas migrated from Myanmar and Bangladesh, collectively dubbed as 'boat people' by international media, to Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand by rickety boats via the waters of the Strait of Malacca and the Andaman Sea. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates about 25,000 people have been taken to boats from January to March in 2015. There are claims that around 100 people died in Indonesia, 200 in Malaysia, and 10 in Thailand during the journey. An estimated 3,000 refugees from Myanmar and Bangladesh have been rescued or swum to shore and several thousand more are believed to remain trapped on boats at sea with little food or water. A Malaysian newspaper claimed crisis has been sparked by smugglers. However, the \"Economist\" in an article in June 2015 wrote the only reason why the Rohingyas were willing to pay to be taken out of Burma in squalid, overcrowded, fetid boats as \"... it is the terrible conditions at home in Rakhine that force the Rohingyas out to sea in the first place.\"\n\nOn 9 October 2016, insurgents attacked three Burmese border posts along Myanmar's border with Bangladesh. According to government officials in the mainly Rohingya border town of Maungdaw, the attackers brandished knives, machetes and homemade slingshots that fired metal bolts. Several dozen firearms and boxes of ammunition were looted by the attackers from the border posts. The attack resulted in the deaths of nine border officers. On 11 October 2016, four soldiers were killed on the third day of fighting. Following the attacks, reports emerged of several human rights violations allegedly perpetrated by Burmese security forces in their crackdown on suspected Rohingya insurgents.\n\nShortly after, the Myanmar military forces and extremist Buddhists started a major crackdown on the Rohingya Muslims in the country's western region of Rakhine State in response to attacks on border police camps by unidentified insurgents. The crackdown resulted in wide-scale human rights violations at the hands of security forces, including extrajudicial killings, gang rapes, arsons, and other brutalities. The military crackdown on Rohingyas drew criticism from various quarters including the United Nations, human rights group Amnesty International, the US Department of State, and the government of Malaysia.\n\nThe de facto head of government Aung San Suu Kyi has particularly been criticized for her inaction and silence over the issue and for doing little to prevent military abuses.\n\nGovernment officials in Rakhine State originally blamed the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO), an Islamist insurgent group mainly active in the 1980s and 1990s, for the attacks; however, on 17 October 2016, a group calling itself the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) claimed responsibility. In the following days, six other groups released statements, all citing the same leader. The Myanmar Army announced on 15 November 2016 that 69 Rohingya insurgents and 17 security forces (10 policemen, 7 soldiers) had been killed in recent clashes in northern Rakhine State, bringing the death toll to 134 (102 insurgents and 32 security forces). It was also announced that 234 people suspected of being connected to the attack were arrested.\n\nA police document obtained by Reuters in March 2017 listed 423 Rohingyas detained by the police since 9 October 2016, 13 of whom were children, the youngest being ten years old. Two police captains in Maungdaw verified the document and justified the arrests, with one of them saying, \"We, the police, have to arrest those who collaborated with the attackers, children or not, but the court will decide if they are guilty; we are not the ones who decide.\" Myanmar police also claimed that the children had confessed to their alleged crimes during interrogations, and that they were not beaten or pressured during questioning. The average age of those detained is 34, the youngest is 10, and the oldest is 75.\n\nThe Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) stated on 1 September 2017 that the death toll had risen to 370 insurgents, 13 security personnel, 2 government officials and 14 civilians. The United Nations believes over 1,000 people have been killed since October 2016, which contradicts the death toll provided by the Myanmar government.\n\nStarting in early August 2017, the Myanmar security forces began \"clearance operations\" against the Rohingya in northern Rakhine state. Following an attack by Rohingya militants of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) against several security forces' outposts, 25 August, the operations escalated radically—killing thousands of Rohingya, brutalizing thousands more, and driving hundreds of thousands out of the country into neighboring Bangladesh while their villages burned—with the Myanmar military claiming that their actions were solely attacks on rebels in response to the ARSA attack. However, subsequent reports from various international organizations have indicated that the military operations were widespread indiscriminate attacks on the Rohingya population, already underway before the ARSA attacks, to purge northern Rakhine state of Rohingya, through \"ethnic cleansing\" and/or \"genocide.\" In August 2018, study estimated that more than 24,000+ Rohingya people were killed by the Myanmar military and the local Buddhists since the \"clearance operations\" started on 25 August 2017. The study also estimated that 18,000+ the Rohingya Muslim women and girls were raped, 116,000 Rohingya were beaten, 36,000 Rohingya were thrown into fire \n\nAccording to BBC reporters, during the summer of 2017, the Myanmar military began arming and training Rakhine Buddhist natives in northern Rakhine state, and in late summer advised that any ethnic Rakhines \"wishing to protect their state\" would be given the opportunity to join \"the local armed police.\" Matthew Smith, chief executive of human rights organization Fortify Rights says that arming the Rakhines \"was a decision made to effectively perpetrate atrocity crimes against the civilian population.\" At the same time, northern Rakhine state faced food shortages, and, starting in mid-August, the government cut off all food supply to the area. On 10 August, the military flew in a battalion of reinforcements to the area, triggering a public warning from the resident United Nations human rights representative to Myanmar, who urged Myanmar authorities to restrain themselves.\n\nA few weeks later, on 24 August 2017, the Rakhine Commission (chaired by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan)—established by the new civilian Myanmar government to recommend solutions to the ethnic conflict and related issues in Rakhine state—released its recommendations for alleviating the suffering of minorities (especially the Rohingya), calling for measures that would improve security in Myanmar for the Rohingya, but not calling for all measures sought by various Rohingya factions.\n\nThe following morning, according to Myanmar military officials, a Rohingya rebel group (ARSA, or Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army) led multiple coordinated attacks on 30 police outposts and border guards, killing a dozen government forces, at the cost of over 50 dead among the rebels.\n\nAlmost immediately the Myanmar military—apparently teaming with local authorities with mobs of Rakhine Buddhist civilians—launched massive reprisals that it described as its anti-terrorist \"clearance operations\" (which, UN investigators and BBC reporters later determined, had actually begun earlier)—attacking Rohingya villages throughout northern Rakhine state.\n\nWithin the first three weeks, the military reported over 400 dead (whom it described as mostly \"militants\" and \"terrorists\")—the U.N. estimated over 1,000 dead (mostly civilians), and other sources initially suggested as many as 3,000—in the first four weeks of the reprisals.\n\nHowever, in December 2017, following a detailed survey of Rohingya refugees, a humanitarian organization serving refugees, Médecins Sans Frontières calculated that at least 6,700 Rohingya men, women and children were killed in the first month of the major attacks, including at least 750 children (that number later revised to \"over 1,000\"). MSF estimated that 69% were killed by gunshots, 9% were burnt to death (including 15% of children killed), and 5% beaten to death. However, MSF cautioned \"The numbers of deaths are likely to be an underestimation, as we have not surveyed all refugee settlements in Bangladesh and because the surveys don't account for the families who never made it out of Myanmar.\"\n\nRefugees reported numerous civilians—including women and children—being indiscriminately beaten, raped, tortured, shot, hacked to death or burned alive. and whole villages being burnt down by authorities and Buddhist mobs. Human Rights Watch released satellite photos showing the villages burning, but the Myanmar government insisted the fires were lit by Rohingya, themselves, or specifically Rohingya militants—though the authorities offered no proof of the allegation, and refused or tightly controlled all media and foreign access to the area.\n\nMyanmar's presidential spokesman reported that 176 ethnic Rohingya villages—out of the original a total of 471 Rohingya villages in three townships—had become empty. In addition to the 176 \"abandoned\" villages, some residents reportedly fled from at least 34 other villages.\n\nIn the first four weeks of the conflict, over 400,000 Rohingya refugees (approximately 40% of the remaining Rohingya in Myanmar) fled the country on foot or by boat (chiefly to Bangladesh—the only other country bordering the Rakhine state area under attack) creating a major humanitarian crisis. In addition, 12,000 Rakhine Buddhists, and other non-Muslim Rakhine state residents were displaced within the country.\n\nOn 10 September 2017, ARSA declared a temporary unilateral ceasefire to allow aid groups to work in the region. Its statement read that \"ARSA strongly encourages all concerned humanitarian actors resume their humanitarian assistance to all victims of the humanitarian crisis, irrespective of ethnic or religious background during the ceasefire period.\" However, the Myanmar government dismissed the gesture, saying \"we don't negotiate with terrorists.\"\n\nThe violence and humantarian 'catastrophe,' inflamed international tensions, especially in the region, and throughout the Muslim world.\n\n13 September, Myanmar's presidential spokesman announced Myanmar would establish a new commission to implement some recommendations of Annan's Rakhine Commission, in their August 2017 report.\n\nThe United Nations initially reported in early September 2017 that more than 120,000 Rohingya people had fled Myanmar for Bangladesh due to a recent rise in violence against them. The UNHCR, on 4 September, estimated 123,000 refugees have escaped western Myanmar since 25 August 2017. (By 15 September, that number had surpassed 400,000) The situation was expected to exacerbate the current refugee crisis as more than 400,000 Rohingya without citizenship were trapped in overcrowded camps and in conflict regions in Western Myanmar.\n\nMyanmar's de facto civilian leader and Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, criticized the media's reporting on the crisis, saying that her government is protecting everyone in Rakhine state, and argued that the reporting was misinformation that benefitted the aims of terrorists.\n\nSome reports suggest that the Myanmar military has ceded some border outposts to rebels armed with wooden clubs as part of encouraging Rohingyas to leave the country.\n\nA Holy See diplomat stated that at least 3000 people were killed by Myanmar security forces in August and September 2017.\n\nThe U.N. Secretary General issued a statement, 13 September 2017, implying that the situation facing the Rohingya in Rakhine state was \"ethnic cleansing.\" He urged Myanmar authorities to suspend military action and stop the violence—insisting that Myanmar's government uphold the rule of law, and (noting that \"380,000\" Rohingya had recently fled to Bangladesh) recognize the refugees' right to return to their homes.\n\nThe same day, the U.N. Security Council issued a separate, unanimous statement, on the crisis following a closed-door meeting about Myanmar. In a semi-official press statement (its first statement on the situation in Myanmar in nine years)—the Council expressed \"concern\" about reported excessive violence in Myanmar's security operations, called for de-escalating the situation, reestablishing law and order, protecting civilians, and resolution of the refugee problem.\n\nOn 19 September 2017, Myanmar's civilian leader, State Councillor Aung San Suu Kyi, made a major televised speech on the crisis—in English—stating \"We condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence,\" and indicated a desire to know why the Rohingya were fleeing. But Suu Kyi largely defended her prior position supporting the Myanmar military and its actions, and deflected international criticism by saying most Rohingya villages remained intact, and conflict had not broken out everywhere. Expressing no criticism of the Myanmar military, and denying that it had engaged in any \"armed clashes or clearance operations\" since 5 September, she added, \"We are committed to the restoration of peace and stability and rule of law throughout the state,\" and that the country was \"committed to a sustainable solution… for all communities in this state\", but was vague as to how that would be achieved.\n\nBy the end of September, conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and outnumbered Hindus, became apparent—including the killing of around 100 Hindu villagers in Rakhine state, around late August—according to the Myanmar military who claimed to have found the bodies of 20 women and eight boys in mass graves, 24 September, after a search near Ye Baw Kya village, in northern Rakhine state. The search was reportedly in response to a refugee in Bangladesh who contacted a local Hindu leader in Myanmar. Authorities quoted the refugee as saying about 300 ARSA militants, on 25 August, marched about 100 people out of the Hindu village and killed them. ARSA denied involvement, saying it was committed to not killing civilians. International news media were not immediately allowed free access to the area to verify the reports.\n\nIn other cases, in Myanmar and in Bangladeshi refugee camps Hindu (particularly women) are reported to have faced kidnapping, religious abuse and \"forced conversions\" by Muslim Rohingyas.\n\nBy the end of September 2017, UN, Bangladesh and other entities were reporting that—in addition to 200,000-300,000 Rohingya refugees already in Bangladesh after fleeing prior attacks in Myanmar—the current conflict, since late August 2017, had driven 500,000 more Rohingya from Myanmar into Bangladesh, creating what UN Secretary General António Guterres described as \"the world's fastest-developing refugee emergency ... a humanitarian nightmare.\"\n\nIn November 2017 Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding for the return home of Rohingya refugees. In April 2018 the first group of Rohingya refugees returned to Myanmar from Bangladesh.\n\nIn January 2016, the government of Bangladesh initiated a plan to relocate tens of thousands of forcibly displaced Rohingyas, who had fled to the country following persecution in Myanmar. The refugees are to be relocated to the island of Bhasan Char. The move has received substantial opposition. Human rights groups have seen the plan as a forced relocation. Additionally, concerns have been raised about living conditions on the island, which is low-lying and prone to flooding. The island has been described as \"only accessible during winter and a haven for pirates\". It is nine hours away from the camps in which the Rohingya currently live. In October 2019, Bangladeshi authorities again announced plans to relocate refugees to the island.\n\nIn 2015, an assessment by the Yale Law School concluded that the government of Myanmar was waging a concerted campaign against the Rohingya, a campaign which could be classified as genocide under international law. An investigation by the media channel Al Jazeera English, along with the group Fortify Rights, found that the Myanmar military was systematically targeting the Rohingya population because of its ethnicity and religion. The International State Crime Initiative of the University of London issued a report stating that a genocide is taking place against the Rohingya.\n\nThe United Nations High Commission for Refugees has used the term ethnic cleansing to describe the exodus of Rohingya from Myanmar. In December 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, dismissed the Myanmar government's claims that its operations were merely a response to rebel attacks, and it also indicated that \"for us, it was clear... that these operations were organised and planned,\" and could amount to \"genocide.\"\n\nOn 24 August 2018, the day before the anniversary of the eruption of extreme violence that came to be known as the \"Rohingya Crisis,\" the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report (which was not made public until 27 August) which summarized its findings after an investigation was completed into the events of August–September 2017. It declared that the events constituted cause for the Myanmar government—particularly the Myanmar military (the \"Tatmadaw\") and its commanding officers—to be brought before the International Criminal Court and charged with \"crimes against humanity\", including \"ethnic cleansing\" and \"genocide.\" Myanmar officials immediately rejected the charges.\n\nThose who identify as Rohingyas typically reside in the northernmost townships of Arakan bordering Bangladesh where they form 80–98% of the population. A typical Rohingya family has four or five surviving children but numbers up to twenty eight have been recorded in rare cases. Rohingyas have 46% more children than Myanmar's national average. In 2018, 48,000 Rohingya babies were born in Bangladesh, out of a total population of 120,000 fertile women. As of 2014, about 1.3 million Rohingyas lived in Myanmar and an estimated 1 million lived overseas. They constitute 40% of Rakhine State's total population or 60% of it if the overseas Rohingya population is included. As of December 2016, 1 7th stateless of the entire world's stateless population is Rohingya according to United Nations figures.\n\nPrior to the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis and the military crackdown in 2016 and 2017, the Rohingya population in Myanmar was around 1.1 to 1.3 million They reside mainly in the northern Rakhine townships, where they form 80–98% of the population. Many Rohingyas have fled to southeastern Bangladesh, where there are over 900,000 refugees, as well as to India, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. More than 100,000 Rohingyas in Myanmar live in camps for internally displaced persons, and the authorities do not allow them to leave.\n\nThe following table shows the statistics of Muslim population in Arakan. The data is for all Muslims in Arakan (Rakhine), regardless of ethnicity. The data for Burmese 1802 census is taken from a book by J. S. Furnivall. The British censuses classified immigrants from Chittagong as Bengalis. There were a small number of immigrants from other parts of India. The 1941 census was lost during the war. The 1983 census conducted under the Ne Win's government omitted people in volatile regions. It is unclear how many were missed. British era censuses can be found at Digital Library of India.\n\nRohingya culture shares many similarities to that of other ethnic groups in the region. The clothing worn by most Rohingyas is indistinguishable from those worn by other groups in Myanmar. Men wear \"bazu\" (long sleeved shirts) and \"longgi\" or \"doothi\" (loincloths) covering down to the ankles. Religious scholars prefer wearing \"kurutha\", \"jubba\" or \"panjabi\" (long tops). In special occasions, Rohingya men sometimes wear \"taikpon\" (collarless jackets) on top of their shirts.\n\n\"Lucifica\" is a type of flat bread regularly eaten by Rohingyas, while \"bola fica\" is a popular traditional snack made of rice noodles. Betel leaves, colloquially known as \"faan\", are also popular amongst Rohingyas.\n\nThe Rohingya language is part of the Indo-Aryan sub-branch of the greater Indo-European language family and is related to the Chittagonian language spoken in the southernmost part of Bangladesh bordering Myanmar. While both Rohingya and Chittagonian are related to Bengali, they are not mutually intelligible with the latter. Rohingyas do not speak Burmese, the \"lingua franca\" of Myanmar, and face problems in integration. Rohingya scholars have written the Rohingya language in various scripts including the Arabic, Hanifi, Urdu, Roman, and Burmese alphabets, where Hanifi is a newly developed alphabet derived from Arabic with the addition of four characters from Latin and Burmese.\n\nMore recently, a Latin alphabet has been developed using all 26 English letters A to Z and two additional Latin letters Ç (for retroflex R) and Ñ (for nasal sound). To accurately represent Rohingya phonology, this alphabet also uses five accented vowels (áéíóú). It has been recognised by ISO with ISO 639-3 \"rhg\" code.\n\nDue to the fact that members of Burma's Rohingya Muslim population are not considered citizens of the country, they are not protected against discrimination by the Burmese government. Therefore, concerns exist with regard to the community's lack of religious freedom, especially in the legal and political sphere.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Rohingya people practice Islam, including a blend of Sunni Islam and Sufism and about 2.5% of Rohingya are Hindu. The government restricts their educational opportunities; so many of them pursue fundamental Islamic studies as their only option. Mosques and madrasas are present in most villages. Traditionally, men pray in congregations and women pray at home.\n\nMuslims have often faced obstacles and struggled to practice their religion in the same way as other individuals in Burma. These struggles have manifested themselves in the form of difficulty in receiving approval for the construction of places of worship, whether they be informal or formal. In the past, they have also been arrested for teaching and practicing their religious beliefs.\n\nThe Rohingya face discrimination and barriers to health care. According to a 2016 study published in the medical journal \"The Lancet\", Rohingya children in Myanmar face low birth weight, malnutrition, diarrhea, and barriers to reproduction on reaching adulthood. Rohingya have a child mortality rate of up to 224 deaths per 1,000 live births, more than 4 times the rate for the rest of Myanmar (52 per 1,000 live births), and 3 times rate of rest non-Rohingya areas of Rakhine state (77 per 1,000 live births). The paper also found that 40% of Rohingya children suffer from diarrhea in internally displaced persons camp within Myanmar at a rate five times that of diarrheal illness among children in the rest of Rakhine.\n\nThe Rohingya people have been described as \"one of the world's least wanted minorities\" and \"some of the world's most persecuted people\". Médecins Sans Frontières claimed that the discrimination and human rights challenges which the Rohingya people have faced at the hands of the country's government and military are \"among the world's top ten most under-reported stories of 2007.\" In February 1992, Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in a press release, \"In actual fact, although there are (135) national races living in Myanmar today, the so-called Rohingya people is not one of them. Historically, there has never been a 'Rohingya' race in Myanmar.\"\n\nThe Rohingya are denied freedom of movement as well as the right to receive a higher education. They have been denied Burmese citizenship since the 1982 nationality law was enacted. Post the 1982 law, Burma has had different types of citizenship. Citizens possessed red identity cards; Rohingyas were given white identity cards which essentially classified them as foreigners who were living in Burma. Limitations and restrictions imposed on Rohingya are facilitated by this difference in citizenship. For example, Rohingyas cannot enlist in the army or participate in the government, and they are potentially faced with the issue of illegal immigration. The citizenship law also significantly underlies the human rights violations against the Rohingya by the military. \n\nThey are not allowed to travel without official permission and they were previously required to sign a commitment not to have more than two children, though the law was not strictly enforced. They are subjected to routine forced labour. (Typically, a Rohingya man has to work on military or government projects one day a week, and perform sentry duty one night a week.) The Rohingya have also lost a lot of arable land, which has been confiscated by the military and given to Buddhist settlers who have moved there from elsewhere in Myanmar.\n\nThe military is partially responsible for the human rights violations which have been committed against the Rohingya. These violations include destruction of property and forced relocation to another country. One such violation was committed when the military forced Rohingyas in Rakhine to move to Bangladesh. Other human rights violations against Rohingya Muslims include physical violence and sexual violence. The country's military officials rationalized these violations by stating that they were required as part of a census that was going to be conducted in Burma and the military needed to perform these acts in order to find out what the Rohingya Muslims's nationality was. According to Amnesty International, the Rohingya have been subjected to human rights violations by Burma's military dictatorship since 1978, and many of them have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result. The dislocation of the Rohingya Muslims from their homes to other areas can be attributed to factors such as how isolated and undeveloped Rakhine is, the conflict between the Rohingya Muslims and the Buddhists, and the discrimination which they have been subjected to by the government. \n\nMembers of the Rohingya community were displaced to Bangladesh where the government of the country, non-governmental organisations and the UNHCR gave aid to the refugees by providing them with homes and food. These external organisations (other than those which were controlled by the government) were important because the immigration of the Rohingyas was massive due to the number of people who needed help.  In 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees helped the Bangladeshi government repatriate Rohingyas from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses inside the refugee camps threatened this effort. In 2015, 140,000 Rohingyas were still living in IDP camps, three years after fleeing communal riots in 2012. Despite earlier repatriation efforts by the UN, the vast majority of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh are unable to return to Myanmar due to the communal violence which occurred there in 2012 and their fear of persecution. The Bangladeshi government has reduced the amount of support it allocates to the Rohingyas in order to prevent an outflow of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh. In February 2009, many Rohingya refugees were rescued by Acehnese sailors in the Strait of Malacca, after 21 days at sea.\n\nThousands of Rohingyas have also fled to Thailand. There have been charges that Rohingyas were shipped and towed out to the open sea from Thailand. In February 2009, evidence showing the Thai army towing a boatload of 190 Rohingya refugees out to sea surfaced. A group of refugees who were rescued by Indonesian authorities stated that they were captured and beaten by the Thai military, and then abandoned at sea.\n\nSteps to repatriate Rohingya refugees began in 2005. In 2009, the government of Bangladesh announced that it would repatriate around 9,000 Rohingyas who were living in refugee camps inside the country back to Myanmar, after a meeting with Burmese diplomats. On 16 October 2011, the new government of Myanmar agreed to take back registered Rohingya refugees. However, these repatriation efforts were hampered by the Rakhine riots in 2012.\n\nOn 29 March 2014, the Burmese government banned the word \"Rohingya\" and asked that members of the minority group be registered as \"Bengalis\" in the 2014 Myanmar Census, the first census to be held in three decades. On 7 May 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the United States House resolution on persecution of the Rohingya people in Burma that called on the government of Myanmar to end the discrimination and persecution. Researchers from the International State Crime Initiative at Queen Mary University of London suggest that the Myanmar government is in the final stages of an organised process of genocide against the Rohingya. In November 2016, a senior UN official in Bangladesh accused Myanmar of ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas. However, Charles Petrie, a former top UN official in Myanmar, said that \"Today using the term, aside from being divisive and potentially incorrect, will only ensure that opportunities and options to try to resolve the issue to be addressed will not be available.\n\n\n"}

Atlee Burpee & Co., is an American seed company that was founded by Washington Atlee Burpee in Pennsylvania in 1876.\n\nW. Atlee Burpee & Company was founded in 1876 by Washington Atlee Burpee in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after starting a mail-order chicken business in 1876. The company expanded to selling garden seeds, farm supplies, tools and hogs after customers began asking for seeds they had grown in their native farms. In 1888, the family farm, Fordhook Farms in Doylestown, Pennsylvania was established as a family farm and crop field trials after Burpee began traveling to Europe to collect seeds which needed to be adopted to North American climates. The farm was likely the first experimental test field station in the United States. In 1900, distant cousin Luther Burbank visited the farm inspiring him to create his own experiments. He later created additional research stations, including in California in 1909, to test seeds. By the turn of the century, Burpee's had created one of the largest mail and freight businesses of the time.\n\nThe direction of the company began to change with the death of its founder in 1915, when his son, David Burpee, inherited the company. David was interested in war or victory gardens and was an early promoter of the concept during World War I. He also prioritized in flowers and initiated several flower hybridization breeding programs. Geneticists also began to modify the genes of seeds using x-rays and colchine. \n\nUnder his leadership, the advertising and catalog also improved. The advertisements began to include full-color advertising to include Burpee's strengths of reliability of seeds using the motto \"Burpee's Seeds Grow\" and leader in the industry while the catalog was compact, arranged by category, and easy to find the order form. Any information not included in the catalog was sent to the customer requesting it in a handwritten letter. The catalog's sales averaged $4 per order (roughly $53 dollars in 2019). Various artists illustrated the catalog including Paul de Longpre and Alois Lunzer.\n\nAfter Burbank's death in 1926, Burpee acquired the rights to his experiments but no notable vegetables or flowers were to come from Burbank's work. In 1949, Burpee introduced its 'Big Boy' tomato hybrid which quickly became its best sellers.\n\nIn 1970, David Burpee sold the company to General Foods for $10 million. In 1974, Burpee moved from its north Philadelphia location to its current headquarters at 300 Park Avenue in Warminster, Pennsylvania. SEPTA extended its Warminster Line commuter rail to Warminster, the train station being opposite Park Avenue from Burpee's headquarters. In the 70s, the company introduced seed-starting kits for beginners, an innovation in the seed industry.\n\nIn 1979, the company was acquired by ITT. David Burpee remained as a consultant until his death in June 1980. In 1981, experimentation and seed production left Fordhook Farms. \n\nIn the 1980s, gardens had begun to shrink in size from 600 square feet to 325 square feet while chain stores began selling a better selection of plants to their customers who preferred plants over seeds. These market changes and mismanagement by ITT led Burpee's sales to slump and was purchased for $15 million by new investors McKinsley & Co. in 1987. In 1991, the Burpee company was acquired by George Ball, Inc., a diversified horticultural family business. The new leadership diversified the business by selling new and unusual varieties; more plants than seeds; opening its own retail stores in 2000; and utilizing its web store to boost business. Jonathan Burpee, the founder's grandson, was the last Burpee family member to work for the company. In 1998, Ball purchased the family farm where notable varieties such as Iceberg lettuce and Big Boy tomato were bred to renovate and establish the property as a horticultural center. The seeds Burpee produces are almost exclusively grown in California.\n\nIn March 2019, James Mattikow was named the company's president and CEO.\n\nDavid Burpee began working to hybridize the marigold in 1919 to despite its limited colors, scrawniness, and late blooming flower. It was at this time that he first had the idea of a white marigold competition but held off on it due to his belief that the hybridization would be unsuccessful.\n\nIn its 1954 catalog, W. Atlee Burpee & Co. first advertised a competition for the development of the first white marigold flower, offering $10,000 to any gardener whose efforts produced a flower deemed to be pure white. 21 years later, the prize was awarded to 67-year-old Alice Vonk of Sully, Iowa, who received $100 the previous year as one of six gardeners nationwide whose marigolds came closest to being white. Vonk kept seeds from the lightest flowers in her garden each season, replanting for over two decades before achieving a pure white marigold that measured 2.5 inches in diameter. Her entry in the 1975 edition of the contest topped 8,200 other entrants and produced what was then described as the \"costliest flower ever.\" Burpee's branded the flower as \"Burpee's Best Whites.\"\n\nBy 1960, the odorless flower was the best-selling flower in the United States.\n\n"}

After the Austrian Anschluss in 1938, he accepted the new regime, but remained critical.

He was not stationed near Hitler's headquarters at Wolfsschanze near Rastenburg when the 20 July assassination attempt was carried out, but was in Berlin instead. Unaware that the bomb had failed to kill Hitler, Bernadis was responsible for the order that set Operation Valkyrie in motion. That same evening, he was arrested by the Gestapo. On 8 August, he was sentenced to death by the German \"People's Court\" (\"Volksgerichtshof\") and executed the same day.\n\nDespite being deported to a concentration camp, Bernardis's family survived the war.\n\nIn the 2004 German production, \"Stauffenberg\", Bernardis is portrayed by actor Michael Bornhütter.\n\n"}

His family belonged to the nobility of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nThe son of a land surveyor and member of the minor nobility, he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Surveying - and later the General Staff academy. From 1892-1895, Bonch-Bruyevich served as an officer with the Lithuanian Guards Regiment, posted at Warsaw.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I Bonch-Bruyevich was in command of the 176th Perevolochensky Regiment, based at Chernigov. \nHe was an eyewitness to the aerial ramming attack in which the Russian aviator Pyotr Nesterov died.\nAfter the February Revolution, in March 1917, the Provisional Government put him in command of the Russian garrison in Pskov and was elected to the executive of the Pskov soviet, but was transferred to the northern front after Riga was captured by the German army. He was commander of the Northern Front from 29 August 1917 to 9 September 1917.\n\nAfter the October Revolution, Bonch-Bruyevich was one of the first high ranking army officers to rally to the new regime, with which he had a strong family link, because his younger brother, Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich was a leading Bolshevik.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Pittsburgh Pirates, Colorado Rockies, and Chicago White Sox. At and , Morneau was drafted as a catcher by the Twins in 1999. He converted to first base in the minor leagues and made his MLB debut in 2003. Morneau held that position throughout his career and in 2007 became the first Twin since Gary Gaetti in 1987–1988 to hit 30 home runs in consecutive seasons. He is now a special assistant for the Minnesota Twins.\n\nA four-time All-Star despite an injury-riddled career, Morneau was named the 2006 American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP), finished runner-up for MVP in 2008, and won two Silver Slugger Awards. Additionally, Morneau won the 2008 Home Run Derby and the 2014 National League (NL) batting title. Internationally, Morneau represented Canada at the 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2017 World Baseball Classic.\n\nMorneau is the youngest son of George Morneau, a hitting coach for many softball and baseball teams, childcare worker, and sporting goods store owner. His mother Audra Chartrand is an elementary school teacher and former fast-pitch softball player. Justin has an older brother, Geordie. His father once played hockey for the Brandon Wheat Kings and attended the training camp of the Minnesota North Stars.\n\nMorneau grew up in New Westminster, British Columbia, the historic \"Royal City\", adjacent to Vancouver, where he played hockey for the local minor team, the New Westminster Royals, and emerged as a star goaltender, playing for teams a year older than he was. He also played baseball in the New Westminster Minor Baseball Association and for the North Delta Blue Jays in the B.C. Premier Baseball League.\n\nMorneau attended Lord Tweedsmuir Elementary School in New Westminster, later transferring to Richard McBride Elementary School, where his mother was a teacher and coach and where he enrolled in a French immersion program. He played basketball and volleyball and ball hockey on the school teams.\n\nGrowing up, Morneau was an avid sports fan, whose favourite athletes included hockey players Patrick Roy, fellow BC boy Cam Neely, Ray Bourque and baseball players John Olerud, Ken Griffey Jr, Jack Morris and Larry Walker. He was a Boston Bruins and Toronto Blue Jays fan.\n\nMorneau attended St. Thomas More Collegiate High School in 1994–95, for his grade 8 year, where he played basketball. Coaches approached him to play for the school's famed football program, based on his athletic ability, but he declined.\n\nMorneau transferred to New Westminster Secondary School and graduated in 1999. He continued to play basketball and hockey while in high school. He was named the New Westminster High School Athlete of the year and was a member of Canadian national champion baseball teams in 1997 and 1998. In 1998, he was selected the best hitter and catcher of the National Championships playing for Team British Columbia.\n\nMorneau was associated with the Portland Winter Hawks of the Western Hockey League; he attended training camp and played one preseason game of Major Junior hockey as a goaltender. Morneau chose his jersey number (33) for goalie Patrick Roy. He is listed as winning the Memorial Cup in 1998 with the Winter Hawks.\nAs Morneau put it, \"I was the third goalie. A backup to the backup. If somebody got hurt, I might have gotten out there as a backup. I played in an exhibition game and backed up some regular-season games.\". Morneau remained on Portland's Protected Player List until he decided to focus on baseball instead of hockey. According to Winter Hawks assistant coach at the time, Mike Williamson, \"He was young and raw — a big guy who covered a lot of the net. I remember a conversation we had with him when recruiting him. We told him he should go to hockey because not many Canadian guys end up going very far and doing very well in baseball. He showed us otherwise.\"\n\nMorneau did not attend college, despite receiving many attractive offers from NCAA schools. He was selected by the Twins in the 3rd round as the 89th overall pick of the 1999 MLB amateur entry draft. He converted to first base in 2001 while playing for the Class-A Quad Cities River Bandits. In six minor league seasons, he hit .310 with 87 home runs, 153 RBIs and 122 doubles.\n\nMorneau participated in the 2002 and 2004 All-Star Futures Games, playing for the World teams. Morneau played for the World team in MLB Futures Game, July 7 in Milwaukee. Morneau was twice named Eastern League Player of the Week, April 22–28 and July 15–21. On September 3, Morneau was promoted to Minnesota's Triple A team, The Edmonton Trappers. During his first Triple A season, Morneau won the PCL championship with the Trappers.\n\nMorneau made his major league debut with the Twins on June 10, 2003 against the Colorado Rockies, batting clean-up. He singled in his first career at-bat off Jason Jennings and went 2 for 4 in the game. A week later, he hit his first career home run off Kansas City Royals reliever Albie Lopez. Morneau went on to hit four home runs in his rookie season while batting .226. He spent the majority of the season with the Twins' Triple-A affiliate Rochester Red Wings.\n\nIn 2004, after Morneau compiled impressive minor league numbers, the Twins dealt veteran first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz to the Boston Red Sox and Morneau became the Twins' starting first baseman. He appeared in 74 games for the Twins in 2004, hitting 19 home runs and 58 RBIs in 280 at bats while committing just three errors.\n\nThe 2005 season was a struggle for Morneau, as he dealt with off-season illnesses as well as being hit in the head by a pitch in April. Although he never appeared to fully shake off his early season setbacks, Morneau finished the 2005 season second on the Twins in home runs with 22 and paced the squad with 79 RBI.\n\nDuring Morneau's first three seasons with the Twins, he wore #27. Starting in 2006, he wore #33 for the rest of his Twins career. After a slow start to 2006, Morneau exploded offensively in the months of June, July, and August, raising his batting average nearly 50 points in June after beginning the month hitting .240. He raised his average another 33 points in July and after June consistently appeared near the top of the American League leaderboard in batting average, home runs, and RBI. On August 9, Morneau became the first Twin since 1987 to hit 30 home runs in a single season. He finished the season hitting .321 (6th in the AL) and slugging .559 (6th in AL) with 34 home runs and 130 RBI. He was second in the league in RBIs and tied Larry Walker's 1997 total for the most RBIs in a season by a Canadian. For his hitting, he won the 2006 American League Silver Slugger Award representing first basemen. His efforts helped the Twins win their fourth division title in five years.\n\nOn November 21, 2006, Morneau won the American League Most Valuable Player Award in a close vote over Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees, becoming only the fourth player in Twins history (after Zoilo Versalles, Harmon Killebrew, and Rod Carew) to receive the honour. He became the first Canadian to win the AL MVP award, and the second Canadian to win a major league MVP award (Larry Walker was the first, having won the NL MVP Award in 1997; Walker and Morneau were joined in 2010 by Joey Votto).\n\nIn 2007, Morneau played in 157 games, hitting 31 home runs. In May 2007, Morneau won the Player of the Month in the American League for the first time in his career. Morneau appeared on the cover of the arcade baseball video game The Bigs in Canadian stores and at Best Buy stores in the United States. Morneau was named to the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game roster in 2007 for the first time. He also participated in the 2007 State Farm Home Run Derby for the first time. He was up first and hit 4 homers and ended up tying with Albert Pujols in the first round. He was subsequently eliminated with only one homer on 5 chances in a tie-off. Pujols advanced to the 2nd round with 2 homers. Morneau had his first career three home run game on July 6, 2007, against the Chicago White Sox. He had a solo, a 2-run, and a 3-run homer. He had an at bat to try for his fourth home run, but his bat got under the ball, and he flew out to deep left field.\n\nIn January 2008, Morneau agreed to a six-year contract worth $80 million, which at the time was the longest and richest contract in Minnesota Twins history until in 2010, teammate Joe Mauer signed an 8-year, $184 million contract. Morneau produced with his new contract, as he played in all 162 of the Twins' games and hit .300 with 23 home runs and 129 RBI.\n\nOn July 10, 2008, Morneau tied a career high with 5 hits in a game as the visiting Minnesota Twins defeated the Detroit Tigers. He hit what went on to be the game-winning home run to finish the day 5 for 5 with a walk in a 7–6 extra-innings win. Morneau was then announced as a reserve player for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\n\nMorneau won the 2008 Home Run Derby, defeating Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers. He became the first Canadian to win the Home Run Derby. Later during the All-Star event, Morneau scored the winning run for the American League in the MLB All Star Game at Yankee Stadium on a sacrifice fly to right field off the bat of Michael Young. Morneau was awarded the Lionel Conacher Award as the Canadian Press Male Athlete of the Year, joining Ferguson Jenkins and Larry Walker as the only Major League Baseball players to win the award. Morneau finished second in the balloting for AL MVP, as Dustin Pedroia won, and Kevin Youkilis came in third.\n\nIn 2009, Morneau hit 30 home runs and was selected as a reserve position player at first base for the 2009 All Star Game. On September 14, Morneau was officially diagnosed with a stress fracture in his back after a long slump; he missed the rest of the 2009 season and the playoffs.\n\nMorneau got off to a strong start in the 2010 campaign, hitting a career first-half high .345 batting average and having a major-league leading .437 on-base percentage and .617 slugging percentage at the All-Star break. For the first time in his career, he was voted in by the fans to start the 2010 All-Star Game at first base, but ended up pulling out from the event after sustaining a concussion on July 7.\n\nMorneau missed the remainder of the 2010 regular season with the effects of post-concussion syndrome. After the Twins clinched the American League Central Division championship, Morneau said that he was finally symptom-free. Morneau said he would be unavailable for the ALDS, but that he hoped to be available for the ALCS should the Twins advance. On October 4, 2010, the Twins announced that Morneau would not return for the 2010 season, regardless of how far the team went in the postseason.\n\nIn 2011, the Twins were glad to see Morneau somewhat recovered from his season-ending concussion in the previous season. He was in the Opening Day starting line-up against the Toronto Blue Jays. This did not last long, though, as he missed five games with the flu later in April and a couple of games in June with a sore wrist. He underwent neck surgery in June to correct pinched nerves in his neck, causing him to miss two months from mid-June to mid-August. Just ten days later, he missed two games with a bruised foot. On August 29, 2011, Morneau suffered a left shoulder injury that would lead to mild concussion-like symptoms. These symptoms eventually led to Morneau missing the remainder of the season. In 2011, Morneau appeared in just 69 games collecting just 60 hits, only four of them home runs. He batted a meager .227 with 19 walks and 30 RBI. All of the previous are career lows disregarding his rookie season.\n\nIn 2012, Morneau returned as an everyday first baseman for the Twins. Appearing in 134 games, Morneau finished the season with a .257 batting average, 19 home runs and 77 RBI.\n\nIn 2013, before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 31, Morneau played in 127 games for the Twins. He had nearly matched his total stats for 2012, batting .259 with 17 home runs and 74 RBI.\n\nOn August 31, 2013, Morneau was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Alex Presley and a player to be named later, who was later identified as Duke Welker on October 5, 2013. On September 1, 2013 he made his debut with the Pirates, playing first base and wearing number 66. Morneau wore number 33 in Minnesota, but due to number being retired in Pittsburgh (in honor of Honus Wagner), he simply decided to double it.\n\nOn December 3, 2013, Morneau agreed to a 2-year, $14 million deal with the Colorado Rockies, pending a physical. The deal became official on December 13. Morneau became the first Rockies player since Larry Walker to wear #33 as it had been out of circulation, but not retired for Walker since he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2004. Morneau went on to have a solid year in Colorado, batting .319 on the season and claiming the National League battle title. Morneau had a .310 batting average in 49 games with the Rockies in 2015.\n\nOn June 9, 2016, Morneau signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Chicago White Sox. He was immediately placed on the 15-day disabled list, and was projected to return after the All-Star break. Due to Zach Duke wearing number 33, Morneau decided to wear number 44 instead.\n\nIn 1545 games over 14 seasons, Morneau posted a .281 batting average (1603-for-5699) with 772 runs, 349 doubles, 23 triples, 247 home runs, 985 RBI, 573 bases on balls, .348 on-base percentage and \n.481 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .996 fielding percentage playing at first base. In 13 postseason games, he hit .302 (16-for-53) with 8 runs, 4 doubles, 2 home runs and 4 RBI.\n\nAfter playing for Canada in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, but spending the 2017 MLB Season as a free agent, Morneau took a job as a special assistant to the Minnesota Twins, functionally ending his playing career.\n\nMorneau was selected for the Canada national baseball team at the 2006 World Baseball Classic, 2009 World Baseball Classic, 2013 World Baseball Classic, 2017 World Baseball Classic and 2019 WBSC Premier12.\n\nAnd also, Morneau was selected for the MLB-All-Stars at the 2014 MLB Japan All-Star Series.\n\nMorneau's parents divorced when he was 7 years old. His mother is a retired teacher and his father works in a warehouse. He has an older brother named Geordie. His mother remarried in 2006 and now Justin has two stepsisters. Morneau married Minnesota native Krista Martin in January 2009. Their daughter Evelyn was born on September 23, 2010; their son Marty was born on July 21, 2012.\n\nMorneau purchased a house in his hometown of New Westminster. His house is just four blocks from Queen's Park, where he grew up playing hockey and baseball. As a homesick minor leaguer in Florida, he would log onto a Vancouver radio station online to hear the weather and traffic reports and wonder what his friends were up to back home.\n\nMorneau's family is well known in New Westminster. On February 2, 2008, the city honored him by renaming Moody Park Diamond #5 to Justin Morneau Field. Morneau Field is located just from a field named for one of Morneau's idols, Larry Walker Field, located in the nearby city of Maple Ridge.\n\nMorneau is superstitious. For much of his career, he wore number 33 to honor his idol, former NHL goaltender Patrick Roy. As a young hockey player, he would refuse to leave the car for hockey games until the clock read :33 minutes past the hour. (He actually appears as an Easter egg in the NHL video game, NHL 2K8, playing his junior position of goaltender.)\n\nMorneau had a superstitious routine on game days in Minnesota. Before each home game, Morneau stopped by the same Jimmy John's Gourmet Subs, on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, Minnesota and ordered the same sandwich from the menu: Turkey Tom with no sprouts. Later, he drank a slurpee from a slurpee machine in the Twins' clubhouse made of one-half Mountain Dew, one-half red or orange flavor.\n\nThe Justin Morneau Foundation was established by Morneau himself and his wife, Krista, to support underprivileged communities with an emphasis on those where the Morneaus have lived.\n\nOver a span of four years, (2008–2011) Morneau mailed more than 200 personalized holiday gifts to Twins employees, including the Target Field grounds crew.\n"}

The game's music was composed by Junko Tamiya, credited in the game as \"Gonzou\".\n\nThe game revolves around a young boy in his own surreal dreams as he journeys to Slumberland. Nemo can ride certain animals such as a frog, a gorilla, or a mole, by feeding them candy. Each animal has its own skills needed to complete each level. The purpose of the game is to travel to the Nightmare land to rescue Morpheus, the king of Slumberland, from the clutches of the evil Nightmare King.\n\nIn \"Little Nemo: The Dream Master\", the player controls Nemo as he proceeds through side-scrolling, 2D levels. In each level, Nemo must collect a specific number of keys, which are generally scattered throughout the rather large levels. The number of keys needed to beat each level is not indicated to the player until reaching the exit at the end of the level, which has a corresponding number of locks. The player must proceed through each level, typically left to right but also up and down, searching for keys.\n\nThroughout each level the player encounters several animals, which, after being fed, will allow Nemo to use their powers. A similar game mechanic would be used in \"Kirby's Adventure\" three years later. Using the powers of some animals is necessary, while others simply make things a little easier. The animal's life-bars often differ from Nemo's, with some animals possessing extra health bars. Such abilities are vital, as many challenging obstacles exist throughout the game, and enemies are virtually almost infinite. As such, \"Little Nemo\" is generally regarded as a highly difficult game.\n\nAllgame editor Christian Huey praised the game, describing it as \"a wonderfully creative side-scrolling platformer\".\n\nSteven Petite of Digital Trends called \"Little Nemo: The Dream Master\" 'one of the best NES games of all time'. \n\nChristopher Bowen of Gaming Bus wrote that \"Little Nemo: The Dream Master\" was 'punishingly difficult at times, even by NES games standards'. Bowen went on to give the game a 'B-' while also noting that it belongs in the second tier of Capcom licensed games.\n"}

Hacker was founded in 1417, 99 years before the enactment of the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516.\n\nAs one of six breweries located within Munich's city limits, its beers are among those served at Oktoberfest.\n\nIn the late 18th century, Joseph Pschorr (1770-1841) bought the Hacker brewery from his father-in-law Peter-Paul Hacker. He subsequently founded a separate brewery under his own name. His two sons, Georg Pschorr (1798-1867) and Matthias Pschorr Sr., divided his estate by each taking control of one of the two separate breweries. In 1972, Hacker and Pschorr merged to form Hacker-Pschorr, but the beers were sold as separate brands well after 1975.\n\nWhen Crown Prince Ludwig I of Bavaria was to celebrate his wedding in Munich in 1810, he decided it was an occasion for all of Bavaria to celebrate. He commissioned Josef Pschorr, then the brewmaster of the Hacker-Pschorr brewery, among other Munich brewers, to develop special brews to commemorate the occasion.\n\nSubsequent annual celebrations evolved into the city of Munich’s Oktoberfest, which is attended by over six million people each year, who in 2011 consumed over six million litres of beer. By Munich law, only the six breweries within the city limits of Munich are invited to serve their beer at Oktoberfest. Hacker-Pschorr is one of the six, as is its sister brand, Paulaner. Today’s event is held on land donated by Josef Pschorr.\n\nPrior to 2009, Hacker-Pschorr was imported to the U.S. via Star Brand Imports, based in White Plains, New York and part of Heineken International. In 2009, Paulaner HP USA (formerly Distinguished Brands), of Littleton, Colorado, took over the import business of Hacker-Pschorr and Paulaner in the United States.\nHacker-Pschorr produces 15 different products, some of them are only seasonally available.

The picture was directed by John Cromwell and written by Steve Fisher and Oliver H.P. Garrett based on a story by Gerald Drayson Adams and Sidney Biddell, adapted by Allen Rivkin.\n\nLeaving a church, Father Logan, a well known ex-paratrooper padre, is approached by Captain \"Rip\" Murdock (Humphrey Bogart). Murdock needs to tell someone what has happened to him in the past few days in case his enemies get to him. A flashback follows.\n\nJust after World War II, paratroopers and close friends Captain Murdock and Sergeant Johnny Drake (William Prince) are mysteriously ordered to travel from Paris to Washington, D.C. When Drake learns that he is to be awarded the Medal of Honor (and Murdock the Distinguished Service Cross), he disappears before newspaper photographers can take his picture. Murdock goes AWOL, follows the clues and tracks his friend to Gulf City in the southern United States, where he learns Drake is dead – his burned corpse is recovered from a car crash.\n\nMurdock finds out that Drake joined the Army under an assumed name to avoid a murder charge. He was accused of killing a rich old man named Chandler because he was in love with his beautiful young wife Coral (Lizabeth Scott). Murdock goes to a nightclub to question Louis Ord (George Chandler), a witness in the murder trial. Ord reveals that Drake had given him a letter for Murdock. Murdock also meets Coral and Martinelli (Morris Carnovsky), the club owner, there. Seeing Coral losing heavily at roulette, Murdock not only recoups her losses at craps, he wins her $16,000. For some reason, however, she is uncomfortable with the situation. When they go to collect the money in Martinelli's private office, Murdock accepts a drink; it is drugged. When he wakes up the next morning, he finds Ord's dead body planted in his hotel room. He manages to hide the corpse before police Lieutenant Kincaid (Charles Cane), responding to an anonymous tip, shows up to search his room.\n\nMurdock teams up with Coral. Suspecting that Martinelli had Ord killed in order to get the letter, Murdock breaks into his office, only to find the safe already open. Just before he is knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant, he smells jasmine, the same aroma as Coral's perfume. When Murdock awakens, Martinelli has him roughed up by his thug, Krause (Marvin Miller), to try to find out what is in the coded letter. However, Murdock is able to escape his captors when taking him back to his hotel, the police arrive. The flashback ends, and Murdock slips away.\n\nNow suspicious of Coral, he goes to her apartment to confront her. She claims to be innocent, but finally admits that she shot her husband in self-defense. She went to Martinelli for advice and gave him the murder weapon to dispose of, but he has been blackmailing her ever since. In love with her himself, Murdock agrees to leave town with her, but insists on retrieving the incriminating weapon first, despite Coral's objections. He threatens Martinelli with a gun, eliciting some startling revelations. The club owner reveals that Coral is his wife. He killed Chandler (having learned the man had lied about having only six months to live) and framed Drake so that Coral could inherit the estate. Murdock gets what he came for and forces Martinelli to precede him out of the building. As he opens the door, Martinelli is shot and killed.\n\nMurdock jumps into the waiting car and drives off with Coral. As they are speeding away, he accuses her of having just tried to kill him. When she shoots him, the car crashes. He survives, but she suffers fatal injuries. In the hospital, Murdock comforts her in her final moments.\n\n\n\"Dead Reckoning\" was originally intended by Columbia Pictures' production chief Harry Cohn as a vehicle for Rita Hayworth, a follow-up to the extremely popular \"Gilda\". Cohn thought that the pairing of Hayworth and Bogart would be a guaranteed money maker. Hayworth was under contract to Warner Bros., but Warners owed Columbia for several previous star loan-outs, so they agreed to lend Hayworth to Cohn for the film. Hayworth, however, could not come to contractual terms with Columbia and refused to make the film, so she was replaced by Lizabeth Scott, who was borrowed from Paramount Pictures' producer Hal Wallis. Scott, an up-and-coming actress being promoted as \"The Threat\", was often compared to Bogart's wife, Lauren Bacall, as both were former models, and had deep, sultry voices. Bogart was a loan-out from Warners as well, and was reportedly unhappy with being sent to Columbia at the height of his career, if only because Warners kept any extra money paid by Columbia over and above Bogart's usual salary. \n\nBogart had right of refusal over the director for the film, and picked John Cromwell. Bogart and Cromwell had worked together on Broadway when Bogart was a very young actor and Cromwell, the play's director, cast him in his first bit part in 1922.\n\nBogart was responsible for Murdock's extended speech to Scott about men carrying women around in their pockets, taking them out when they were needed to have dinner with or make love to. This idea was one that Bogart was known to espouse when he had been drinking. \n\nThe song \"Either It's Love or It Isn't\", sung by Lizabeth Scott, had words and music by Allan Roberts and Doris Fisher.\n\nMany of \"Dead Reckoning\"'s exterior shots were filmed on location in St. Petersburg, Florida. Other background and location shooting took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; LaGuardia Airport in New York City; and Biloxi, Mississippi.\n\n\"The New York Times\" gave the film a mixed review, praising Bogart as \"beyond criticism in a role such as \"Dead Reckoning\" affords him\", with \"some of the best all-around dialogue he has had in a long time.\" However, it was less kind to his co-star, Scott, \"whose face is expressionless and whose movements are awkward and deliberate.\" Although the actions of Bogart's character are not particularly plausible at times, and the plot was considered to be \"rambling\" with \"a lot of things about the script ... that an attentive spectator might find disconcerting,\" the \"Times\"' found that \"the suspense is skillfully drawn out.\"\n\n\"Variety\" magazine also praised Bogart and liked the film, writing, \"Humphrey Bogart's typically tense performance raises this average whodunit quite a few notches. Film has good suspense and action, and some smart direction and photography ... Bogart absorbs one's interest from the start as a tough, quick-thinking ex-skyjumper. Lizabeth Scott stumbles occasionally as a nitery singer, but on the whole gives a persuasive sirenish performance.\"\n\nIn 2004, film critic Dennis Schwartz was critical of the film. He wrote, \"This second-rate Bogart vehicle has the star depart from his usual tough-guy role, though he manages to get into plenty of the action. It plays as a bleak crime melodrama that is too complexly plotted for its own good ... There's some fun in watching the Bogart character romance the husky-voiced femme fatale character played by Lizabeth Scott, but not enough fun to overcome how unconvincing is the sinister plot.\"\n\n\"Time Out\" calls Scott \"synthetic\" but \"alluring\", and detects a \"hint of self-parody\" in Bogart's performance. It says that their \"relationship never quite convinces, leading to a faintly embarrassing emotional climax.\" The film, according to the reviewer, \"tries too hard to maintain its note of doomed noir romance,\" but is nevertheless \"[h]ighly enjoyable\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1918683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918683", "title": "Return of the Killer Tomatoes", "text": "Return of the Killer Tomatoes\n\nReturn of the Killer Tomatoes! is a 1988 American parody film directed by John De Bello. The first sequel to the 1978 film \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\", the film stars Anthony Starke, Karen Mistal, and John Astin, as well as George Clooney in an early role. The film has developed a cult following.\n\nSet ten years after the events of \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" (referred to as the \"Great Tomato War\"), the United States is once again safe, and tomatoes have been outlawed (although authorities still deal with \"tomato smugglers\" who sell to people who cannot live without ordinary tomatoes). Wilbur Finletter (Steve Peace) has been praised as a hero of the Great Tomato War and parlayed his fame into opening Finletter's Pizzeria, which serves tomato-less pizzas. Working for Wilbur is his nephew Chad Finletter (Anthony Starke) who is a delivery boy. Also with Chad is his roommate Matt Stevens (George Clooney), a suave ladies' man.\n\nHowever, trouble returns with a misanthropic villain, Professor Mortimer Gangreen (played by John Astin) and his assistant Igor (Steve Lundquist - who also is an Olympic swimming gold medalist) seek to unleash another wave of tomato terror. Professor Gangreen was perplexed at being defeated by \"Puberty Love\", the worst song ever created, and says that this time music will aid, rather than hinder him. Gangreen has created a tomato transformation chamber by which he can turn ordinary tomatoes into replicas of men and women. By dipping ordinary tomatoes into vats of toxic waste and then placing them into the chamber, Gangreen uses music to his advantage, as the juke box that is hooked up to the chamber syncs up with the tomato transformation chamber, allowing him to create virtually anything by the use of whatever song he has picked (Michael Jackson music seems to make tomatoes into a clone of Jackson, the \"Miami Vice\" theme seems to make replicas of Don Johnson and seductive music apparently turns tomatoes into beautiful women). Gangreen's preferred music is rock, which creates soldiers. With his tomato commandos, Professor Gangreen seeks to attack the nearby prison where he will break out his imprisoned ally Jim Richardson (Rick Rockwell), then take over the United States under the subjugation of his killer tomatoes and installing Richardson as President of the United States. Gangreen has also used his device to create an attractive female replica named Tara (Karen Mistal), who serves Gangreen (as she straightforwardly informs a visitor: \"I'm his lover. I also cook and clean.\") until she realizes his abusive attitude towards a wrongly mutated tomato whom she dubs FT, or Fuzzy Tomato. Tara defects to Finletter's Pizza where she starts dating Chad.\n\nThe quirky plot line partially breaks the \"fourth wall\" as the characters relate to the audience that the production has run out of money. Matt suggests \"product placement\" – at that time an emerging practice in film and television – as a solution for the financial problems. From that point forward, the film's characters comically showcase and promote various products as the film's plot line continues.\n\nChad and Tara have a whirlwind romance where everything seems to be going magically except for Tara's strange behavior and extreme aversion to any form of music. Chad's dislike of tomatoes eventually causes a rift between himself and Tara and after an extremely caustic remark at a romantic dinner Tara dumps a drink in Chad's lap in retaliation. While Chad is in the bathroom cleaning up a violinist comes by and begins to play for Tara, who changes back into a tomato. Panic ensues and the restaurant empties as the other patrons flee in terror at the sight of the tomato. The sound of a chiming grandfather clock turns her back into a human as Chad returns to the now-deserted restaurant and they leave.\n\nTara continues to protect FT while living with Chad (and Matt). Chad notices the garbage truck Igor is driving while Igor tries to find Tara and follows it to the dump (where Igor picks up more toxic waste) and back to Dr. Gangreen's house where Chad watches as they transform a tomato into a person.\n\nGoing home Chad finds Tara consuming plant food—they both scream and she runs away, only to be kidnapped by Igor and returned to Dr. Gangreen. Chad, who has found a tomato at a grocery store he believes to be Tara, returns with Matt to use Dr. Gangreen's equipment to restore the woman he loves. They find the machine can create a wide range of people depending on the music used, including more beautiful women (of great interest to Matt) but they do not get Tara back. They are captured by Dr. Gangreen who squishes the tomato and has Igor throw Chad and Matt into the dungeon.\n\nThere they find Tara undamaged and in human form and she and Chad reconcile. Outside the locked door they hear FT, to whom they pass a message that FT is to deliver to Wilbur who gathers the team of heroes from the first movie to rescue the captives. But while they are en route Dr. Gangreen forces Chad and Matt into the transformation chamber and starts a countdown that at the end will transform the two into tomatoes. He and Igor then leave with a captive Tara to raid the prison and start Dr. Gangreen's plan for world domination but Wilbur and his team rescue them just in time.\n\nAt the prison Dr. Gangreene transforms a bag of tomatoes into a massively-muscled and well-armed assault team and they storm the prison. While fighting Tara breaks away and Gangreen and Igor chase her, who are in turn chased by Chad, Matt, Wilbur and the others. They find Gangreen and Igor have imprisoned Tara in a gas chamber and threaten to gas her if the pursuers do not surrender. Also Igor has a hand grenade. In the ensuing fight FT throws himself on the live hand grenade before it explodes and Gangreen successfully triggers the gas. As the fumes envelope Tara behind the door she and Chad have a tearful farewell and it appears Tara is finished. Matt presses a button to clear the gas from the chamber.\n\nA distraught Chad opens the door to find an unharmed Tara; she isn't human so the gas didn't hurt her. Dr. Gangreen triumphantly plays music to transform Tara back into a tomato but nothing happens; exposure to the gas has made Tara permanently human. The town celebrates the heroes again, including and especially FT, as people wonder where Matt went and it is remarked that he returned to Gangreen's lab to destroy it but he instead is using the equipment to produce beautiful women.\n\nFuture US congressman Gary Condit also had an uncredited and unspoken role in the film. Rick Rockwell, who played Jim Richardson, later would appear on the TV show \"Who Wants to Marry a Multi-millionaire?\".\n\nThe art for the poster, shown above, was created by then illustrator now portrait painter, David R. Darrow, now living in San Jose, CA. The original design as assigned by designer Kevin Eaton and completed by Darrow, used the design of a Campbell's Soup can, using the face of actor John Astin in the center seal. The idea was sidelined over copyright / branding concerns, and a \"patch\" was created to alter the work. High-end digital compositing was too expensive at the time, so Darrow was further commissioned to create the new replacement label which was physically glued over the original illustration, preserving the original background and tomato characters. Darrow still retains the original, 2-layer artwork.\n\nAccording to IMDb it grossed $5 million in U.S. sales.\n\nOut of the more unfavorable reviews, \"TV Guide\" described the film as being a \"unnecessary sequel\" and Emanuel Levy gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5, while other reviews were more favorable.\n\nJoBlo.com reviewer Jason Adams wrote, \"The zany, self-referential style lends itself to a unending stream of gags, and overall more jokes work than don't.\" VultureHound's Lee Hazell wrote that \"\"Return of the Killer Tomatoes\" has everything a comedy like this needs. An irreverent attitude towards filmmaking conventions, genre expectations and downright decency. The manic energy of the Marx Brothers. The wilfully gleeful stupidity of the Zucker films. The playfulness of Mel Brooks. The only thing they don’t have is action scenes with murderous tomatoes. For some reason, the plot dictates that they all get turned into Chippendales with machine guns. So that takes off a point.\" DVD Talk reviewer Adam Tyner wrote, \"Its hyper-meta sense of humor was years (maybe approaching decades) before its time. \"Return of the Killer Tomatoes\" doesn't just break the fourth wall; it grinds it into a fine powder, mixes it with some hardwood mulch, and lets all manner of comedy and humor blossom from there\".\n\nChris Coffel, writing for Bloody Disgusting, in review of the Blu-ray edition of the film, wrote, \"\"Return of the Killer Tomatoes\" has so many great jokes and little tidbits that you can’t possibly catch them in one viewing. It’s similar to \"The Simpsons\" in not only the level of humor it provides but that it’s a movie made for the VHS generation.\" Anthony Arrigo, reviewing the same edition for Dread Central, called the film a \"zany riot. [...] Think the output of Zucker/Abrams back in their heyday, add a dose of Mel Brooks’ humor, and that's the direction for this sequel to the equally absurd \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" (1978). One liners and sight gags fly with such frequency that it's almost impossible to hear and see every joke the first time around. [...] few films have ever taken comedy this meta. The actors don't break the fourth wall; the film itself breaks it!\"\n\n"}

In April 1998, during the dot-com bubble, the company was valued at over $1 billion. In July 2000, it was acquired by Bertelsmann Music Group for $117 million; shortly thereafter Amazon was contracted to operate the website. At its peak, it employed over 750 people and had offices in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, New York City, London, and Los Angeles.\n\nCDnow was founded in February 1994 by twin brothers Jason Olim and Matthew Olim in their parents' basement in Ambler, Pennsylvania. Initially launched as a Telnet service in August 1994, CDNow became a retail website in September 1994 using Valley Records Distributors as a drop-ship fulfillment center. With three employees, the company moved near the Penllyn train station in Lower Gwynedd Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and a couple years later it moved to the Strawbridge & Clothier building in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1997, the company had revenues of $18 million and in February 1998, with 100 employees, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. CDNow then embarked on a large Internet advertising campaign, and was an innovator in preference-based retail recommendations, online video, the use of editorial content as a means to promote interest internet affiliate marketing programs, and email marketing. On March 17, 1999, CDNow acquired its largest competitor, another Philadelphia area company, N2K, whose online properties included Music Boulevard and Jazz Central Station In July 1999, the company announced a deal to merge with Columbia House, establishing a new public company jointly held by CDNow's shareholders, Time Warner and Sony.\n\nCDNow was among the first of the Internet companies to show signs of struggle with the dot-com business model. On March 20, 2000, as the dot-com bubble burst, \"Barron's\" published a cover article called \"Burning Up\", which noted that the company was running out of cash. In March 2000, the Columbia House merger was called off. In June 2000, the company closed its London office to cut costs.\n\nIn July 2000, Bertelsmann Music Group acquired the company, intending to combine it with its BMG Direct record club as a new venture called BeMusic, and eventually add Napster to the service. Bertelsmann paid just $117 million, a price that was down over 90% from the valuation of the company at its peak in April 1998. The founding Olim brothers received a total of $17 million. In April 2001, the company cut 40 employees, 10% of its staff. In August 2001, the company closed its Japanese website and laid off 200 employees.\n\nIn November 2002, Bertelsmann announced it would close CDnow's Fort Washington facility and lay off the company's remaining 33 employees. Later that month, they signed a deal to outsource CDnow website operations to Amazon. The new deal retained a revised version of the BMG Direct model called the \"Preferred Buyers Club\", offering a 20% discount for club-edition records; all other music was sold at standard Amazon prices.

{"id": "1918715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918715", "title": "Euripus Strait", "text": "Euripus Strait\n\nThe Euripus Strait ( ) is a narrow channel of water separating the Greek island of Euboea in the Aegean Sea from Boeotia in mainland Greece. The strait's principal port is Chalcis on Euboea, located at the strait's narrowest point.\n\nThe strait is subject to strong tidal currents which reverse direction approximately four times a day. Tidal flows are very weak in the Eastern Mediterranean, but the strait is a remarkable exception. Water flow peaks at about , either northwards or southwards, and lesser vessels are often incapable of sailing against it. When nearing flow reversal, sailing is even more precarious because of vortex formation.\n\nThe Swiss scholar François-Alphonse Forel contributed to an understanding of the enigmatic phenomenon by his study of limnology and the discovery of seiche, where layers of water of differing temperature oscillate in thickness in a confined body of water. But the problem was solved completely only by D. Eginitis, director of the Athens Observatory, who published his conclusions in 1929.\n\nThere are two road bridges across the strait, both at Chalcis. One is the Euripus Bridge or Chalcis Bridge, a two-pylon, cable-suspended bridge built south of town in 1992, and commonly called the \"New\" or \"High\" bridge, with a span of about 215 m (705 ft). The strait is 160 m (525 ft) wide at this point. The bridge is accessible via a fork on the main road at Aulis.\n\nThe \"Old\" or \"Low\" or \"Sliding\" Bridge lies across midtown, and can slide away to allow shipping traffic. It is located at the narrowest point of the strait, where it is only 38 m (125 ft) wide. It accommodates two lanes of vehicular traffic. It was originally built as a retractable bridge in 1858, replaced by a rotating one in 1896. The existing, originally wooden bridge was built in 1962 and was extensively refurbished in 1998.\n\nThe current consensus is that the Euripus was closed by a dike of coarse sediment until about 6000 years ago. It was opened following an (unrecorded) earthquake and remained open (see Herodotus, e.a. VII.173 and VIII.66, on the sea-battle of Artemision) until 411 BC, when the Euboeans decided to renounce their status as an island subject to Athenian hegemony and make themselves part of Boeotia (Diodorus Siculus, \"Bibliotheca Historica\", 13.47, sections 1–8). There is no trace of this either in Thucydides or in Xenophon (in \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" and in \"Hellenica\" respectively.) Diodorus mentions specifically that gaps had to be left in the dike to allow the Euripus tides to flow through and that the current became much more intense owing to the narrowness of the passage and says that a single passage was left just wide enough for a single ship. Strabo (IX.2.2) wrote of some later time when there was a bridge two plethra long (approximately 50 m, which is probably an exaggeration). Some vestiges of the two ends of the dike of 411 probably remained, so that this later bridge was probably narrower than the channel that existed before 411 BC. We have no information about the depth, but even in the case of a channel about 50 m wide under Strabo's bridge, the depth could have been scoured out to a level entirely sufficient for ancient shipping.\n\nIt is not until the time of the Emperor Justinian I, that we have evidence of two channels in the Euripus, the large original channel and a new, narrow cleft to the east of it, so narrow that it could be crossed on a plank of wood. (Procopius, \"On the Buildings\", 4.3.16.) This later stream is what was eventually widened to make the present shipping channel. At the time when Procopius wrote, the name of the fortress on the Euripus was probably \"Euripus,\" which had become \"Egripos\" by 1204, and was adopted and slightly altered to \"Nigriponte\" by the Latins who occupied the place in 1205. (The name has nothing to do with any sort of \"Black Bridge,\" except as a Veronese or Venetian joke, or folk-etymological corruption or re-interpretation in reference to the old bridge across the channel.)\nIn 1395, Nicola di Martoni came to Negropont during the return from his pilgrimage to Egypt and Palestine. He is clear that the main shipping channel in the Venetian period was on the side of the Boeotian mainland, and mentions the mills on the narrower channel, which he says were sometimes broken in the speed and turbulence of the flow there.\n\nWe have further information about the shipping channel and its single wooden bridge from various documents in the archives of the Venetian Empire. In 1408, the formation of a reef under the bridge severely affected shipping (http://www.archiviodistatovenezia.it/divenire/collezioni.htm \"Senato, Deliberazioni, Misti\". 48,43v) and in 1439 there was concern over the tendency of the current to erode the surroundings of the pilings that supported the bridge (http://www.archiviodistatovenezia.it/divenire/collezioni.htm \"Senato, Deliberazioni, Misti\". 60,140r–42r).\n\nEvliya Çelebi, in his \"Travel Journal\" (SN VIII250a27, ff.), tells us that the narrow channel was first opened out enough for a galley to pass through at some time in the late 16th century, and was still just barely wide enough at the time of his visit in 1668 for a galley to squeeze through, even though the old shipping channel had been abandoned.\nBy the end of the 18th century it was well on its way to being the width of the modern channel.\n\n\n"}

On approximately May 13, 2005, Rahimov and persons loyal to him seized control of Qorasuv.\n\nRahimov announced plans to form an Islamic state in place of what are now Central Asian countries. He gave an interview with the Associated Press while seated on horseback, during which he was quoted as saying \n\"We will be building an Islamic state here in accordance with the Quran\" and citing his goals of reaching Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, \"and the rest of the world\".. The AP report indicated that, as of May 17, no Uzbek military forces were present in the area, but contained only speculation as to the numbers of Rahimov's followers.

However it is more generally accepted that the Lyons descend from a French family called de Léon. At the end of the eleventh century the de Leons had come north with Edgar, son of Malcolm III of Scotland to fight against his uncle, Donald Bane. Edgar was victorious and the de Leons received lands that were later called Glen Lyon in Perthshire. In 1105 Roger de Leonne witnessed a charter from Edgar to Dunfermline Abbey.\n\nRobert II of Scotland granted to Sir John Lyon, who was known as the \"White Lyon\" due to his complexion, the thanage of Glamis and five years later he was made Chamberlain of Scotland. Sir John Lyon married king Robert's daughter, Princess Jean Stewart which brought him the lands of Tannadice on the River Esk. Lyon was also granted the barony of Kinghorn, however he was later killed in a quarrel with Sir James Lindsay of Crawford.\n\nSir John Lyon's son, another John Lyon further strengthened the royal ties by marrying a granddaughter of Robert II. John's son, Patrick Lyon was created Lord Glamis in 1445. He became Master of the Household of Scotland and a Privy Councillor. He had previously been sent to England as a hostage in 1424 for the ransom of James I of Scotland.\n\nJohn Lyon, 6th Lord Glamis was a quarrelsome man with a quick temper. He married Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis, granddaughter of Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus who was known as \"Bell the Cat\", and after Douglas died she suffered terribly for the hatred that James V of Scotland had towards all of the name of Douglas. Lady Glamis was accused of witchcraft and despite speaking boldly in her own defense, she was burnt at the stake on castle hill in Edinburgh on 3 December 1540. Her young son was also sentenced to death when he came of age, however the king died before he had grown up and so he avoided the death sentence and was released. The king had taken possession of Glamis Castle and plundered it.\n\nJohn Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis renounced his allegiance to Mary, Queen of Scots and served under the Regents Moray and Lennox. The 8th Lord was made Lord Chancellor of Scotland and also Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. The 9th Lord Glamis was captain of the Royal Guard and a Privy Councillor to James VI of Scotland. He was created Earl of Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon and Baron Glamis in 1606.\n\nJohn Lyon, 2nd Earl of Kinghorne was a close personal friend of James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose. Lyon was with Montrose in 1638 when he subscribed to the National Covenant. Lyon accompanied Montrose on his early campaigns in defense of the Covenant, however he did not support him when he chose to fight for Charles I of England. As a result, Lyon's estates were almost ruined for supporting the Army of the Covenant.\n\nPatrick Lyon, 3rd Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne paid off the debts that he had inherited from his father and was later able to enlarge Glamis Castle.\n\nThe 3rd Earl's son, John Lyon, 4th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne was a member of the Privy Council but opposed the 1707 Treaty of Union. During the Jacobite rising of 1715, his son was a Jacobite who fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir and died defending his regiment's colours. James Francis Edward Stuart (the Old Pretender) stayed at Glamis in 1716 and amongst the relics of the castle today are a sword and watch that belonged to him.\n\nDuring the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Duke of Cumberland stayed at Glamis on his march to the Battle of Culloden, but it is said that he was much less welcome.\n\nCurrent Chief (\"assumed\") - Simon Patrick Bowes-Lyon, 19th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1987-2016 – Rt Hon Michael Fergus Bowes-Lyon, DL, 18th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1972–1987 – Rt Hon Fergus Michael Claude Bowes-Lyon, 17th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1949–1972 – Timothy Patrick Bowes-Lyon, 16th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1944–1949 – Rt Hon Patrick Bowes-Lyon, 15th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1904–1944 – Rt Hon Claude George Bowes-Lyon, KG, KT, GCVO, TD, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1865–1904 – Claude Bowes-Lyon, 13th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1846–1865 – Thomas Lyon-Bowes, 12th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1820–1846 – Thomas Lyon-Bowes, 11th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1776–1820 – John Lyon-Bowes, 10th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1753–1776 – John Bowes, 9th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1735–1753 – Thomas Lyon, 8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1728–1735 – James Lyon, 7th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1695–1712 – Charles Lyon, 6th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1712–1715 – John Lyon, 5th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1695–1712 – John Lyon, 4th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1646–1695 – Patrick Lyon, 3rd Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1615–1646 – John Lyon, 2nd Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\n1606–1615 – Patrick Lyon, 1st Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\nThe seat of the chief of Clan Lyon is at Glamis Castle in Angus, Scotland.\n\nQuarterly, 1st & 4th, argent, a lion \"rampant\" \"azure\", armed and langued \"gules\", within a double tressure flory counterflory of the Second (Lyon); 2nd & 3rd, ermine, three bows stringed paleways Proper (Bowes); \"en surtout\" an inescutcheon \"azure\", thereon a rose \"argent\", barbed \"vert\" and seeded \"or\", ensigned with the Imperial Crown Proper, within a double tressure flory counterflory of the Second, the said inescutcheon ensigned with an Earl’s coronet Proper (the said honourable augmentation being limited to the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and to the heirs succeeding him in his said Earldom).\n"}

{"id": "1918740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918740", "title": "Torshälla", "text": "Torshälla\n\nTorshälla () is a locality situated in Eskilstuna Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden with 7,612 inhabitants in 2010. It is mainly known for steel manufacturing, centered on the Nyby Bruk steel mill, and also for its historic old town centre.\n\nBecause of its historic town status, from 1317 to 1971, Torshälla is customarily referred to as a \"stad\" (\"town\" or \"city\") even though it does not have a population of 10,000, which is the limit presently in use defined by Statistics Sweden.\n\nBefore the local government reform of 1971 Torshälla was an independent municipality. A new proposal to detach Torshälla from Eskilstuna Municipality was turned down in a referendum in 2006.\n\nTorshälla is one of the oldest towns in Sweden and received city rights as early as 1317 from King Birger. The oldest part of the town church is from the 12th century; however, the church was likely built on top of, or close to, the site of an earlier Old Norse holy place, where the god Thor was worshipped during the Viking Age.\n\nThe name Torshälla stems from \"Þors harg\", which means \"place for sacrificing to Thor\". The town is located at Eskilstunaån's very first rapids upstream of Lake Mälaren, creating a natural trading and reloading site. Several archeological digs have uncovered remains of two (possibly three) \"strong houses\", that is, small fortresses or castles, the one on Husberget next to the rapids dating from around 1300 AD. The fortification on Husberget was burned to the ground during the late 14th century.\n\nIn 1436, during the aftermath of the Engelbrekt Rebellion, Torshälla was plundered by the forces of Lord High Constable of Sweden (later King) Karl Knutsson Bonde, due to siding with the local nobleman Erik Puke's uprising.\n\nTorshälla was during the Middle Ages the dominant trading town in Rekarne, the northwestern part of Södermanland County, which roughly corresponds to present day Eskilstuna Municipality. After neighbouring Eskilstuna was granted town rights in 1659, Torshälla lost in relative importance due to the rapid growth of industry and trade in Eskilstuna, the building of a canal bypassing the rapids in Torshälla, and the great fire which devastated Torshälla in 1798.\n\nThe development of Torshälla during the 19th and 20th centuries was greatly influenced by the foundation of an ironworks on the lands of Nyby manor house on the western outskirts of Torshälla. The Nyby Bruk ironworks was founded in 1829 by the silversmith and industrialist Adolf Zethelius. The mill village of Nyby Bruk grew up around the ironworks, forming a symbiotic relationship with the neighbouring town.\n\nSeveral small tool making and mechanical industries were established in Torshälla during the mid- to late 19th century, using the available water power around the river; Johan Termaenius' mechanical works (1846), F O Nyström's tin vessel factory (1854), Ali Andersson's Torshälla saw blade factory (1881) and Holmens' foundry & mechanical works (1888).\n\nIn 1895 the Northern Södermanland Railway was connected to Nyby Bruk, bypassing Torshälla town centre. Passenger traffic on the line was discontinued in 1933 after which the tracks were exclusively used for freight to Nyby.\n\nDuring the years between 1900 and 1940, Torshälla experienced dwindling population numbers with recession hitting the local manufacturing industry hard.\n\nDuring the decades of economic growth leading up to the 1970s the Nyby Bruk steel mill attracted large numbers of workers from other parts of Sweden and from abroad. A significant part of the immigrant workforce was Finnish, which accounts for the high proportion of Sweden Finnish Torshälla inhabitants today.\n\nAs part of the local government reform of 1971 Torshälla became part of neighbouring Eskilstuna Municipality with Eskilstuna as the municipal centre. Due to the close proximity of and loss of business to the larger neighbour Eskilstuna, Torshälla has in recent years gradually acquired the character of a picturesque commuter town, while still retaining a significant stainless steel industry.\n\nIn a referendum concurrent with the elections of 2006, the inhabitants of Eskilstuna Municipality turned down a proposed split of the municipality into two parts, which would have made Torshälla an independent municipality. The result was a 67.5% majority for the status quo. However, Torshälla remains an own administrative division within the municipality, with certain local government duties delegated to the town administration.\n\nThe main industry and private employer in Torshälla is Outokumpu, producing cold rolled stainless steel products at Nyby Bruk.\n\n\n\nTorshälla is situated 4 mi (7 km) north of the municipal seat in Eskilstuna. European route E20 passes south of Torshälla, and the distance by E20 to Stockholm is 71 mi (114 km). Swedish national road 56 passes west of Torshälla, providing road connections to northern and southern Sweden.\n\nThe old Northern Södermanland Railway connection to the present day main line of Svealandsbanan has since the 1930s only been used for goods traffic. The closest train station is in Eskilstuna, and there are frequent city bus connections to Eskilstuna available.\n\nTorshälla boat harbour is reachable by boat from Lake Mälaren through the river Torshällaån and is mostly used by leisure boats and tourist boats. The Eskilstunaån river, upstream of the now-defunct locks in Torshälla Canal, is only partially navigable, due to the very low clearance under the several fixed bridges which have been built over the river since the 1960s.\n\nNotable present and former residents of Torshälla include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1918743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918743", "title": "Propylthiouracil", "text": "Propylthiouracil\n\nPropylthiouracil (PTU) is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. This includes hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter. In a thyrotoxic crisis it is generally more effective than methimazole. Otherwise it is typically only used when methimazole, surgery, and radioactive iodine is not possible. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include itchiness, hair loss, swelling, vomiting, muscle pains, numbness, and headache. Other severe side effects include liver problems and low blood cell counts. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Propylthiouracil is in the antithyroid family of medications. It works by decreasing the amount of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland and blocking the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3).\nPropylthiouracil came into medical use in the 1940s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 3.62 USD a month. In the United Kingdom a month costs the NHS about 52.51 pounds. In the United States the wholesale price is 38.34 USD per month.\n\nPropylthiouracil is generally well tolerated, with side effects occurring in one of every 100 patients. The most common side effects are related to the skin and include rash, itching, hives, abnormal hair loss, and skin pigmentation. Other common side effects are swelling, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, loss of taste, joint or muscle aches, numbness and headache, allergic reactions, and hair whitening.\n\nIts notable side effects include a risk of agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. On 3 June 2009, the FDA published an alert \"notifying healthcare professionals of the risk of serious liver injury, including liver failure and death, with the use of propylthiouracil.\" As a result, propylthiouracil is no longer recommended in non-pregnant adults and in children as the front line antithyroid medication.\n\nOne possible side effect is agranulocytosis, a decrease of white blood cells in the blood. Symptoms and signs of agranulocytosis include infectious lesions of the throat, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin with an overall feeling of illness and fever. A decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) also may occur. Since platelets are important for the clotting of blood, thrombocytopenia may lead to problems with excessive bleeding. Side effects are suspected and the drug is sometimes discontinued if the patient complains of recurrent episodes of sore throat.\n\nAnother life-threatening side effect is sudden, severe, fulminant liver failure resulting in death or the need for a liver transplantation, which occurs in up to 1 in 10,000 people taking propylthiouracil. Unlike agranulocytosis which most commonly occurs in the first three months of therapy, this side effect may occur at any time during treatment.\n\nPropylthiouracil is classified as Drug Class D in pregnancy. Class D signifies there is positive evidence of human fetal risk. The maternal benefit may outweigh fetal risk in life-threatening situations. PTU is preferred over methimazole (which is also a class D) only in the first trimester of pregnancy and in women who may become pregnant because of the increased risk of teratogenicity of methimazole during critical organogenesis. In the second and third trimester, this risk is diminished and methimazole is preferred to avoid the risk of liver complications from PTU in the mother.\n\nThe primary effect on the fetus from transplacental passage of PTU is the production of a mild hypothyroidism when the drug is used close to term. This usually resolves within a few days without treatment. The hypothyroid state may be observed as a goiter in the newborn, and is the result of increased levels of fetal pituitary thyrotropin. The incidence of fetal goiter after PTU treatment in reported cases is approximately 12%.\n\nPTU inhibits the enzyme thyroperoxidase, which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I) to iodine (I), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor thyroglobulin. This is one of the essential steps in the formation of thyroxine (T4).\n\nPTU does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transporter located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors, such as perchlorate and thiocyanate.\n\nPTU also acts by inhibiting the enzyme 5'-deiodinase (tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase), which converts T to the more active form T. (This is in contrast to methimazole, which shares propylthiouracil's central mechanism, but not its peripheral one.)\n\nIt is important to recognize that these enzymes only work on the conjugated tyrosine molecules of T3 and T4: a completely different enzyme family is responsible for the deiodinase activity of iodized single tyrosine molecules within the thyroid follicular cells. For information on that enzyme family, see Iodotyrosine deiodinase.\n\nThe administration is oral, with peak serum concentrations occurring in one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. Depending on several patient variables, however, euthyroid status may not be achieved until 2–4 months after treatment initiation. Of note, the drug is approximately 70% protein-bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the antithyroid agent methimazole is substantially less protein bound. However, both are equally transferred across the placenta.\n\nThe plasma half-life is one hour and is not altered appreciably by the thyroid status of the patient. Due to the concentration in the thyroid, however, dosing intervals may last 8 hours or longer. Less than 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged, with the remaining fraction undergoing extensive hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation.\n\nPropylthiouracil can be prepared from ethyl 3-oxohexanoate and thiourea.\n\nPropylthiouracil, together with phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), are known to have bitter taste. However, it seems the propensity for tasting these compounds is genetically based and the bitter taste is likely to be engendered by the thiocyanate moiety, also present in PTC.\n\nIt was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1947.\n\n\n"}

On July 10, 1997, ValuJet announced it would merge with the much smaller Airways Corporation, the owner of Orlando, Florida based AirTran Airways. In November 1997, AirTran Holdings announced it would move its headquarters to Airways' existing headquarters in Orlando from Atlanta;<ref name=\"AirTran-Holdings-Dec-1997-S-4/A\"></ref> on November 17, 1997, Airways Corporation and ValuJet completed their merger and the name ValuJet was dropped.\n\nOn January 11, 1999, Joseph Leonard was elected as the chairman, president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\nOn August 15, 2001, AirTran stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn December 2006, AirTran Holdings made public that in December 2005 it had approached the board of directors of Midwest Air Group—owner of Midwest Airlines and Skyway Airlines which operates as Midwest Connect—and had asked the board negotiate a sale of the company. That AirTran offer in 2005 was rebuffed by Midwest's board, which also rebuffed a second offer in late 2006. In December 2006, AirTran disclosed the rejection of both offers in hopes of bringing shareholder pressure on Midwest's board to reconsider, which the board recommended that shareholders reject.\n\nOn December 13, 2006, AirTran announced that it had made an offer to acquire Midwest Airlines, another operator of the Boeing 717. The offer has since been rejected by the Midwest board. On January 11, 2007, AirTran sweetened its offer for Midwest to $13.25 a share from $11.25 a share, valued at US$290 million, or a 24% premium over Midwest's trading price at the time, and AirTran took its renewed bid directly to Midwest shareholders, bypassing Midwest's board of directors; with an offer that expires on April 11, 2007. On April 2, 2007 AirTran raised its bid to $15 a share, in what CEO Joe Leonard called AirTran's final bid.\n\nIn response to AirTran's overtures, Midwest Air Group has stated publicly that it believes that it can maximize shareholder value as a stand-alone company. Midwest Air Group has said that the latest AirTran proposal rejected by its board of directors significantly undervalued Midwest and did not reflect the long-term opportunity inherent in its strategic growth plan. The company also has reiterated that its strategic business plan will offer superior value to shareholders by capitalizing on current industry conditions while remaining true to Midwest's commitment to customer service excellence.\n\nOn January 11, 2007, AirTran Holdings increased its bid for Midwest to $345 million in cash and stock, an 18% increase from their previous offer.\n\nOn April 2, 2007, AirTran again raised its bid for Midwest to $389 million in cash and stock ($9 in cash and .5842 shares of AirTran stock totaling $15 a share). CEO Joe Leonard stated that this would be AirTran's final bid.\n\nIn May 2007, an independent securities expert William McGinnis, CFA, published an analysis of board of directors responsibilities related to hostile takeover offers. He utilized the AirTran offers for Midwest Airlines as the basis for this case study which is available here.\n\nAirTran was successful in having its slate of 3 board members elected to the Midwest Air Group's board of directors in the election on June 14, 2007 at the Midwest annual meeting.\n\nOn August 12, 2007, it was announced that AirTran had lost the bid for Midwest. A private equity group, headed by TPG Capital and including Northwest Airlines, had purchased Midwest and will turn the airline into a privately funded company.\n\nOn August 14, 2007, it was announced that AirTran had renewed their bid for Midwest at a price slightly above that of the TPG Capital offer, in theory at the request of Midwest shareholders. Pequot Capital Management, which owns 8.8% of Midwest, had been unhappy with the TPG Capital offer, as they felt that AirTran's cash and stock offer would result in greater gains because they felt AirTran's stock would rise in value once the acquisition of Midwest was completed. An executive at another unnamed investment group also expressed similar misgivings about the TPG Capital offer. TPG Capital's offer had been $16/share in cash, where AirTran's latest offer is $10 cash plus 0.6056 share of AirTran stock for each share of Midwest, which at the close of trading on August 13 made the value of AirTran's new offer approximately $16.25/share in cash and stock.\n\nHowever, Midwest announced TPG would increase its offer to $17 per share and a definitive agreement had been reached on August 16, 2007.\n\nOn September 27, 2010, Southwest Airlines announced it would acquire AirTran Holdings, along with its subsidiary AirTran Airways. The companies operated separately for a period of time until the absorption of the owned and leased aircraft within AirTran's fleet was completed. On May 2, 2011, AirTran Holdings was purchased by Southwest Airlines. As a result, AirTran Airways and AirTran Holdings both became fully owned subsidiaries of Southwest Airlines.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1918748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918748", "title": "Matthew 2:18", "text": "Matthew 2:18\n\nMatthew 2:18 is the eighteenth verse of the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. Herod has ordered the Massacre of the Innocents and this verse quotes from the Book of Jeremiah to show that this event was predicted by the prophets.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:18\n\nThe verse is a quotation from . This is the first of three times Matthew quotes Jeremiah, the others being and . The verse is similar to the Masoretic, but is not an exact copy implying that it could be a direct translation from the Hebrew. In Jeremiah this verse is a description of Rachel, the long dead mother of the northern tribes, mourning as her children are taken into captivity by the Assyrians. This mourning thus addresses born the Massacre of the Innocents, but the reference to a forced exile can also refer to the Holy Family's Flight into Egypt.\n\nThis has long been considered one of Matthew's more elusive Old Testament references. Scholars have pointed out a number of problems with the context and original meaning. Rachel's tomb has long been associated with Bethlehem an important link between here and the massacre taking place there. However, Brown notes that this view is likely incorrect. Genesis reports that Rachel died and was buried while travelling to Bethlehem and implies that she was still some distance away from the town. In this verse the author of Jeremiah seems to be asserting that she was buried in Ramah, a town some five miles from Bethlehem. The Hebrew word Ramah could also be translated as \"on high\" and some versions of Jeremiah use this wording. \"A voice was heard on high\" would seem to fit more logically with Matthew's narrative, but it is fairly clear that the town is being referred to.\n\nAnother difficulty is that Bethlehem is in Judah, and thus its people were regarded as the children of Leah not Rachel. The verse is also taken somewhat out of context. The passage in Jeremiah is actually one of joy ending with the information that God had saved the Israelites and the children would be unharmed. This is not true of the children of Bethlehem who find no last minute succor. However in the Catholic and Orthodox churches the Holy Innocents were proclaimed to all be saints, thus meeting Jeremiah's message of deliverance.\n\nThe most likely explanation however, is that Rachel represents her descendants more importantly the women of whom lost their children. The voice heard in Rama was that of the lamentation and weeping and great morning taking place in Bethlehem. The outcry was so great that it was heard from over 5 miles away.\n"}
{"id": "1918755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918755", "title": "Kristiansten Fortress", "text": "Kristiansten Fortress\n\nKristiansten Fortress (, historically spelled \"Christiansten\") is located on a hill east of the city of Trondheim in Trøndelag county, Norway, named after Christian V of Denmark-Norway. It was built after the city fire of Trondheim in 1681 to protect the city against attack from the east. Construction was finished in 1685. It fulfilled its purpose in 1718 when Swedish forces laid siege against Trondheim. The fortress was decommissioned in 1816 by king Charles XIV John.\n\nTrondheim was traditionally protected with fortifications by the river Nidelven and Skansen, but the city was vulnerable to attack from the east. The Fortress was therefore put on a hill to protect the city centre and control the area from Ila to Lade. General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, who was chief inspector of fortifications, was responsible for the new town plan of Trondheim after the great fire of 18 April 1681. He also made the plans for the construction of Kristiansten Fortress.\n\nThe fortress was built during the period from 1682 to 1684 and strengthened to a complete defence fortification in 1691 by building an advanced post Kristiandsands bastion in the east and in 1695 with the now vanished Møllenberg skanse by the river Nidelven. These fortifications were encircled by a continuous palisade and thereby connected to the fortified city. In 1750 the fortress was modernized with new bastions and casemates to protect against mortar artillery. Two new isolated defensive works were also built to the east - Grüner's and Frølich's redoubts - but they are hardly visible today.\n\nThe main building featured in the picture is the defensive tower - Donjonen - with artillery, quartering and stores was the centre of the defences. After decommissioning in 1816 it was location of the fire watch, and since 1997 as a museum.\n\nIn the final days of the Great Northern War, Karl XII of Sweden initiated a second invasion of Norway in the fall of 1718. While Karl XII led his main army in an attack from the south at Fredrikshald, an army under General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt (or Armfelt) was sent into Trøndelag to seize Trondheim. Armfeldt advanced against Trondheim, which was defended by an army of 6,900 men under Vincens Budde. The Swedish forces were resisted both by Norwegian forces and by the people of the countryside, who bitterly recalled the previous Swedish occupation of Trøndelag. Provisions were not available, and the Norwegian winter set in. Although he reached the city and laid siege, the strength of Kristiansten Fortress and other fortifications was such that he chose to retreat toward Verdal. Karl XII issued a sharp rebuke and ordered Armfeldt to take Trondheim. Although Armfeldt's forces surrounded Trondheim, Budde's forces were able to keep him at bay. Camping in the open and poorly fed, many of Armfeldt's troops fell ill and his capable forces were reduced to 4,000 men. When Karl XII was killed in December by a bullet at Fredriksten Fortress, Armfeldt's forces retreated to Sweden. On their way back across the mountains, almost the entire army was lost, mostly because of snow, cold temperature and a strong blizzard; the retreat has been likened to Napoleon’s from Moscow for the severity of casualties.\n\nThe Norwegian war flag with the badge denoting the union with Sweden was hauled down on 9 June 1905, and the \"pure\" war flag was hoisted instead, with full military honours and gun salutes for both flags. On 18 November 1905 a twenty-one gun salute was again fired from Kristiansten Fortress to proclaim the election of Prince Carl of Denmark as the new King of Norway under the name of Haakon VII of Norway. The flag of union with Sweden was hauled down and the Flag of Norway hoisted.\n\nDuring German occupation of Norway in World War II the Nazis executed a number of Norwegian patriots at Kristiansten.\n\nThe fortress was the official place of execution of convicted and condemned traitors and war criminals following the legal purge in Norway after World War II. The notorious Henry Rinnan was executed here on 1 February 1947, and nine of his followers afterwards, eight of them on the same day in 1947.\n\nFrom this fortress you can see \"strandlinja\"; a topographical line along the hills of the Bymarka which was formerly beaches and sea cliffs. The \"line\" can be seen stretching out in the hills around Trondheim, but is best seen from the fortress, towards Byåsen.\n\n"}

It formally ended the Japanese invasion of Manchuria which had begun two years earlier.\n\nAfter the Mukden Incident of September 18, 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded Manchuria, and by February 1932, it had captured the entire region. The last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, who was living in exile in the Foreign Concessions in Tianjin, was convinced by the Japanese to accept the throne of the new Empire of Manchukuo, which remained under the control of the Imperial Japanese Army. In January 1933, to secure Manchukuo’s southern borders, a joint Japanese and Manchukuo force invaded Rehe. After conquering that province by March, it drove the remaining Chinese armies in the northeast beyond the Great Wall into Hebei Province.\n\nFrom the start of hostilities, China had appealed to its neighbors and the international community but received no effective support. When China called an emergency meeting of the League of Nations, a committee was established to investigate the affair. The Lytton Commission's report ultimately condemned Japan's actions but offered no plan for intervention. In response, the Japanese simply withdrew from the League on March 27, 1933.\n\nThe Japanese army was under explicit instructions from Japanese Emperor Hirohito, who wanted a quick end to the China conflict, not to venture beyond the Great Wall. Its negotiating position was very strong, as the Chinese republicans were under severe pressure from their simultaneous full-scale civil war with the Chinese communists.\n\nOn May 22, 1933, Chinese and Japanese representatives met to negotiate the end of the conflict. The Japanese demands were severe: a demilitarized zone extending 100 km south of the Great Wall from Beijing to Tianjin was to be created, with the Great Wall itself under Japanese control. No regular Kuomintang military units were to be allowed in the demilitarized zone although the Japanese were allowed to use reconnaissance aircraft or ground patrols to ensure that the agreement was maintained. Public order within the zone was to be maintained by a lightly-armed Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps.\n\nTwo secret clauses excluded any of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies from the Peace Preservation Corps and provided for any disputes that could not be resolved by the Peace Preservation Corps to be settled by agreement between the Japanese and the Chinese governments.\nHarried by their civil war with the communists and unable to win international support, Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese government agreed to virtually all of Japan's demands. Furthermore, the new demilitarized zone was mostly within the remaining territory of the discredited Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang.\n\nThe Tanggu Truce resulted in the \"de facto\" recognition of Manchukuo by the Kuomintang government and acknowledgement of the loss of Rehe. It provided for a temporary end to the combat between China and Japan and relations between the two countries briefly improved. On May 17, 1935, the Japanese legation in China was raised to the status of embassy, and on June 10, 1935, the He-Umezu Agreement was concluded. The Tanggu Truce gave Chiang Kai-shek time to consolidate his forces and to concentrate his efforts against the Chinese Communist Party, albeit at the expense of northern China.\n\nHowever, Chinese public opinion was hostile to terms so favorable to Japan and so humiliating to China. Although the truce provided for a demilitarized buffer zone, Japanese territorial ambitions towards China remained, and the truce proved to be only a temporary respite until hostilities erupted again with the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.\n\n\n\n"}

Production was upstairs to the retail area. To keep up with the regional demands, Koegel opened a processing plant in the mid-1930s on Stevens Street at the Flint River. In 1972, the company operations were moved to Bristol Road, Flint Township.\n\nKoegel's made news when the Michigan Jobs Commission awarded an economic development package to one of Koegel's competitors, Boar's Head Provision Company, in 1998. While Boar's Head is a New York company, it was awarded a large incentive, paid with taxpayer money, to open a processing plant in Michigan. Al Koegel, the son of company founder Albert Koegel, claims that Koegel's has never accepted taxpayer money or tax breaks from the state.\n\nIn 2007, Michigan locations of Costco started carrying Koegel products. In 2008, Koegel's discontinued two products, a honey-style loaf and ham. President John Koegel told the press that in previous years, a couple of truckloads of the ham product would be sold per annum, but declining sales forced its discontinuation. With the downturn of the Great Recession, Koegel sales increased over first couple of years as people prepared meals at home more. Beef prices rose after that cutting into the profits.\n\nIn 2012, Koegel and Meijer agreed to a distribution deal placing Koegel products in Meijer store in other states, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois while keeping direct distribution to Michigan Meijer stores. Keeping Michigan distribution allows their drivers to keep their jobs and retain other customers like A&W, Dairy Queen and Kroger. Previous, the company's products were only available in Michigan and Toledo, Ohio. This deal added 98 new retail outlets for four to six products with two, hot dogs and bologna, being the core products.\n\nA few years before 2016, Koegel was selling nationwide by mail order as far away as Alaska. Keogel Meats was given the 2015 Al Kessel Outstanding Achievement Award by the Michigan Grocers Association. In January 2016, Koegel had to answer multiple inquires, in regards to the Flint water crisis and their water supply, that their plant is not connect to the Flint City water system, but the county run system via Flint Township.\n\nBuilt in 1972, the current factory is on Bristol Road in Flint Township. Features of the plant include:\n\nThe Koegel Meat makes 64 products based on 32 different recipes. This including 16 types of sausage and hot dogs: brats, Italian sausage, foot-longs, franks, vienna frankfurters, bologna rings, chicken frank and Polish sausage. Lunch meat products include bolognas, cotto salami, Dutch loafs, olive loafs, pickle loafs, head cheeses and mac & cheese loaf. Also they make coneys and hot dog chili products.\n\nKoegel uses its original 100-year old recipes that the meat products are smoked with damp sawdust with hardwood for flavor and in its own blend of spices Processes have changed over the 100 years moving from hand stuffing to machine based operation.\n"}
{"id": "1918773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918773", "title": "Lyoness", "text": "Lyoness\n\nLyoness is a multi-level marketing company established in Austria in 2003. According to Lyoness, the company was active in more than 40 countries, spread over six continents, and their shopping community consisted of more than five million members as of 2016. In several countries Lyoness is suspected as being a pyramid scheme.\n\nLyoness operates an international, cross-sectoral shopping community, from which members and merchants presumably benefit through cashback discounts and customer loyalty, respectively.\nLyoness announced that starting July 2014, all network marketing activities are to be bundled under the new brand \"Lyconet\".\n\nThe Lyoness shopping community currently has (as of July 2016) an estimated seven million members around the globe, who receive discounts while shopping at 80,000 Lyoness (2017) partners with over 300,000 points of acceptance. Through the discounts systems, members receive direct discounts of 1-5% in the form of cash back on every purchase made at a Lyoness partner. Depending on the country, the sum of the obtained discounts needs to be 5 or 10 euros or higher in order for it to be transferred to the bank account of the Lyoness member.\n\nCashback and Shopping Points are Member Benefits that are generated when purchasing at a Lyoness Loyalty Merchant. The benefits are depending on the merchant's conditions. Shopping Points can be used for Shopping Point Deals, which could be described as vouchers. Lyoness will transfer the earned Cashback to the bank account registered by the Member.\n\nNext to discounts over personal purchases, Lyoness members receive an 0.5% commission over the purchases made by the people they have introduced to Lyoness, as well as 0.5% over the purchases made by the people introduced by the people they have brought in. Lyoness refers to this system as the ‘Friendship Bonus’.\n\nIn 2004, the CEO of Lyoness, Hubert Freidl, was hired as the company's director. Lyoness comprises at least seven corporations registered in Switzerland, nine corporations registered in Austria and approximately 42 additional national and regional corporations all around the globe. The name \"Lyoness\" was derived from the Celtic mythological kingdom \"Lyonesse\". \"Lyconet\" was introduced in 2014 as a new trademark name for the same group of corporations.\n\nThe Lyoness and Lyconet trademark names cover various corporate structures. The overarching holding corporation is named 'Lyoness International AG', which is supported by several administrative departments (which are registered corporate structures): including: \"Lyoness eBiz GmbH\", \"Lyoness Dataservice GmbH\", \"Lyoness Lyco Soft GmbH\", \"Lyoness Child & Family Foundation\", \"Lyoness Greenfinity Foundation\".\n\nThe continental organisations are subsidiaries of \"Lyoness International AG\" and are registered as stock corporations. These are:\n\"Lyoness Europe AG\" (founded in 2003), \"Lyoness IMEA S.A.\" (2009), \"Lyoness North America Ltd.\", \"Lyoness South America S.A.\", \"Lyoness Asia Ltd.\" (2011).\n\nThe country offices are subsidiaries of the continental stock corporations and are registered as privately owned, limited-liability companies.\n\nLyoness has initiated Cashback cooperations with several sports clubs in Europe since 2015:\n\nAccording to Lyoness, every purchase made by its members at its partner companies benefits the Lyoness Child and Family Foundation (a Lyoness-owned charity organisation) and the Lyoness Greenfinity Foundation (a Lyoness-owned organisation promoting sustainability).\n\nIn 2012, Lyoness announced that it and its affiliated Greenfinity foundation would be the title sponsors of the Austrian Open golf tournament for three seasons, through to 2014. Lyoness also sponsored the ‘European Juniors League’, a European football competition for youth teams, as well as Austrian club SK Rapid Wien. Lyoness announced that it would pay 9 million euros over 5 soccer seasons but would not be the main sponsor of Rapid Wien.\n\nOne year after Lyoness was founded, in 2004, the Austrian criminal police (Kriminalpolizei) published an article in the December issue of its organisation’s magazine, in which it warned of the resurfacing of Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes in Austria. Lyoness was explicitly mentioned in this article. The company contested the allegations publicly. In 2005, Austrian Parliament member, Johann Maier (SPÖ) asked the then-incumbent Austrian Minister of Justice (Karin Miklautsch, BZÖ) parliamentary questions about the reports filed against alleged pyramid schemes in Austria in 2004. Lyoness was one of the organisations complaints were filed against.\n\nIn 2008, the Austrian Chamber of Labour (‘Arbeiterkammer’) of Steiermark issued a warning against Lyoness, listing its alleged privacy violations, misleading advertising, deceptive information and unrealistic and negligible benefits as red flags for doing business with Lyoness.\n\nIn March 2010, the Swiss magazine \"Beobachter\" published an article by Pascale Hofmeier entitled \"Lyoness: Hands off\". In the article, Sara Stalder of the Swiss Consumer Union and Manuel Richard of the Swiss Gambling Commission warn consumers not to do business with Lyoness. In early 2012, \"Kleine Zeitung\" published an article suggesting that Lyoness deceived the masses by operating an irrelevant shopping community. \"L'Hebdo\", a Swiss magazine, reproduced a story about how Lyoness members are told that an investment of 3,000 CHF will eventually lead to 25,000 CHF in return, if enough new, down-paying members are recruited.\n\nIn February 2012, the \"Beobachter\" published an article stating that, based on review of internal Lyoness communication, members are offered ‘bounties’ up to 45,000 CHF to provide ‘relevant information’ on Lyoness’ critics. A critic from Zurich was reported to have been sued for over 1 million CHF for ‘defamation’ after he contacted Lyoness’ partner companies in Switzerland in an attempt to explain the business model of Lyoness to them. The article also reported that the Lyoness business model seems to revolve around recruiting activities instead of discounts and that Lyoness is internationally charged with forgery, fraud and hosting a pyramid scheme.\n\n\"Der Standard\" reported in July 2012 that the Austrian Economic and Corruption Prosecutor (‘WKStA’) has been granted jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute Lyoness in Austria. The Swiss \"Handelszeitung\" mentioned a court case Lyoness lost, which revolved around the question as to whether the company should have issued a financial prospectus before asking investors to finance their advertising campaigns in foreign markets. In September 2012, the same newspaper reported that major, alleged Lyoness partners in Switzerland (Microsoft and Kuoni Travel) were deciding not to continue the partnerships, if there were any to begin with. The \"Wiener Zeitung\" reported about a pending lawsuit initiated by the Austrian Consumer Organisation ‘VKI’ in March 2013. The VKI contested 61 clauses of Lyoness’ ‘General Terms and Conditions’, which it called opaque, uncertain, and/or meaningless. Eric Breiteneder, hired as a legal representative by the organisation, also referred to the concepts used to distinguish various parts of – and benefits within the Lyoness business model as vague and/or undefined elsewhere.\n\nThe \"Handelszeitung\" reported about suspicions that high-level Lyoness members were earlier involved in (other) pyramid schemes, like the ‘Spirit of Independence’. It also mentioned a system called ‘GTS’ (Global Trade System), operated by Erin Trade SA, as a former organisation tied to Hubert Freidl. Like Lyoness, this company has been called a pyramid scheme in the public debate. The \"Kleine Zeitung\" reported that various experts were looking at the investment schemes for advertising campaigns organised by Lyoness, and whether a prospectus was required before attracting capital from investors. Lyoness-hired professor Susanne Kalls concluded that no capital market regulations were violated by not issuing a prospectus; attorney Karl Hengstberger came to the opposite conclusion but agreed with Kalls that the Lyoness business package does not constitute an investment. In the same article, Lyoness spokesman Mathias Vorbach admits that the company may have had some trouble before, but that those days are behind it – Lyoness has learned from its mistakes. He asserts that legal problems have only appeared in Austria (a contested claim) and that 95% of the Lyoness members just shop and do not participate in the earning models offered by Lyoness. However, the \"Beobachter\", after reportedly considering internal Lyoness documents, published an article suggesting that 99.7% of the Lyoness turnover derives from down-payments on future purchases, not from actual shopping or (saved up) discounts.\n\nIn September 2009, Lyoness hired criminal law expert Peter Lewisch to assess whether the company's business model violated the Austrian law concerning illegal pyramid schemes. The study, conducted by Lewisch in September 2013, argued that Lyoness is not a pyramid scheme under Austrian legislation.\n\nLyoness is suspected to be a pyramid scheme in several of the countries it operates in. In its homeland Austria, Lyoness has been declared a pyramid scheme by four independent civil courts. Criminal investigations have also been concluded by the Austrian Economic and Corruption Prosecutor (\"WKStA\"), who maintains that Lyoness operates an illegal pyramid scheme. Lyoness expects to be cleared of all charges. In Australia, Lyoness was under prosecution by the ACCC for operating an illegal pyramid scheme. The trial has ended and the judgment was reserved. In Sweden, the responsible authority concluded that Lyoness is a pyramid scheme and reported Lyoness to the Stockholm police. While initially halted, an appeal by the Gaming Board led to a continuation of the investigation by the Stockholm Police. In Poland, France, Hungary and Lithuania, similar investigations have been conducted or are ongoing. In Greece, the Austrian Lyoness directors have been accused of various types of fraud by the local authorities. Lyoness vehemently denies all allegations.\n\nIn October 2015, the Australian Federal Court found that the loyalty program is not a pyramid scheme as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has originally claimed. The latest decision in Austria also declared that Lyoness is not classified as fraud or any illegal pyramid scheme by the Austrian Economic and Corruption Prosecutor (\"WKStA\"). In April 2016, the Vienna Regional Court stated that Lyoness is not a pyramid scheme. This decision is legally binding and can no longer be subject to appeal.\n\nIn Australia, The Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), after researching Lyoness for a while, instituted proceedings against Lyoness International AG, Lyoness Asia Limited, Lyoness UK Limited and Lyoness Australia Pty Limited (together ‘Lyoness’) for operating a pyramid selling scheme and engaging in referral selling. The ACCC alleges that Lyoness has operated the scheme in Australia from mid-2011 and that it continues to operate the scheme. The scheme offers ‘cash back’ rebates to members who shop through a Lyoness portal, use Lyoness vouchers or present their Lyoness card at certain retailers. Whilst cash back offers themselves are not prohibited by the Australian Consumer Law, the ACCC alleges that the Lyoness scheme also offers commissions to members who recruit new members who make a down payment on future shopping. The ACCC is seeking declarations, pecuniary penalties, injunctions, an order requiring the Lyoness website to link to the case report and costs. As Lyoness International AG, Lyoness Asia Limited and Lyoness UK Limited are located overseas, the ACCC will be making arrangements for service on those entities. The case is before Justice Flick of the Federal Court in Sydney. Lyoness have submitted their defence in October 2014, and the next hearing will be in February 2015. Australian victims claim to have lost thousands of dollars each to Lyoness. The trial has ended and the judgment was reserved. In Greece, an arrest warrant was issued in August 2015 against the Austrian directors of Lyoness Greece. On the 10th of August 2015 the Prosecutor of Thessaloniki Court of First Instance issued an arrest warrant against Herbert Teissel and his wife Anna Teissel, alleged directors of Lyoness Greece, for attempted fraud. Lyoness vehemently denies all allegations.\n\nIn January 2019, Italy’s Competition Authority (AGCM) ruled that the Lyoness cashback formula, which promises a percentage refund of the money spent by consumers shopping at the company’s affiliated retailers, is an unfair and deceptive commercial practice that constitutes a pyramid scheme according to the Italian Consumer Code, and imposed a penalty of €3,200,000 against the company.\n\nOn November 30, 2011, \"Dragons’ Den Canada\" aired an episode featuring the pitch of a Lyoness ‘Premium Member’ from Ontario, Canada in which he asked the ‘Dragons’ to jointly invest 175,000 Canadian Dollars to acquire Lyoness ‘business packages’ through him. None of the Dragons were willing to invest. Instead, they ridiculed him and his business idea, suggesting that it's 'distasteful', and 'a pyramid scheme’. They also advised the Lyoness member, who borrowed against his house to acquire Lyoness positions, not to invest any more money in the Lyoness system.\n\nAnother television show that has reported on Lyoness is the Austrian public television program \"ORF Report\". This programme aired episodes under the names ‘Lyoness - The money machine’ (November 13, 2012), 'Shopping Community Lyoness' (November27th, 2013) and ‘The man behind Lyoness’ (April 24, 2013), interviewing experts and former participants, which both say that Lyoness operates a pyramid scheme behind the façade of a ‘shopping community’\n. The latter episode also features hidden camera footage of Hubert Freidl telling his followers that spreading ‘Cashback Cards’ is irrelevant – ‘it is all about the positions, positions, positions, positions’.\n\nFrom a Lyoness income disclosure statement can be derived that the average Lyoness member in the United States receives a gross annual commission of approximately $275, or $23 per month. The monthly median commission value of $0.38 indicates that the vast majority of the members receives a lower commission than the 23 dollar monthly average.\n\nAdditionally, the document states that 46% of the Lyoness members makes $0 in commission and that the average annual expenditures, not taken into account when calculating the average commission, are $1,294. Similar figures have been reported in 2013, and in Canada.\n\nOn the Internet, various websites and blogs from all over the world have focused critical attention on Lyoness, accusing the company of illegal business practices (mainly of running pyramid and Ponzi schemes) and questioning the alleged partnerships between Lyoness and several multinational corporations, as well as the validity and relevance of the certificates granted to the Lyoness shopping community. In April 2013, it was reported that former (Austrian) participants of Lyoness had organised themselves and founded an organisation and website called \"Plattform Lyoness\". Not much later, an international equivalent was established under the name \"Lyoness Complaint Centre\".\n\nIn the beginning of June 2013, it was reported that Lyoness filed legal complaints against the founders of \"Plattform Lyoness\". The founders were forced to remove legal documents concerning Lyoness from their website. \"Plattform Lyoness\" has reported that a preliminary injunction in a subsequent court case forced \"Plattform Lyoness\" to change its domain name from www.plattform-lyoness.at to www.lyoness-geschaedigte-plattform.at, as the court found that domain names linking to negative content about Lyoness should carry a distinctive term to indicate that the domain is not hosted by Lyoness itself. \"Plattform Lyoness\" solved this by adding the term 'geschaedigte', which is the German word for 'victims'. Lyoness' other demands were not granted by the court.\n\nIn August 2015, the founders of Plattform Lyoness have been cleared of all Lyoness' allegations in court.\n\nOn April 20, 2016 in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Preliminary proceedings against Lyoness regarding fraud and running a pyramid scheme finally terminated.\n"}

{"id": "1918787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918787", "title": "USAir Flight 405", "text": "USAir Flight 405\n\nUSAir Flight 405 was a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight between LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York City, New York, and Cleveland, Ohio. On March 22, 1992, a USAir Fokker F28, registration flying the route, crashed in poor weather in a partially inverted position in Flushing Bay, shortly after liftoff from LaGuardia. The undercarriage lifted off from the runway; however, the airplane failed to gain lift, flying only several meters above the ground. The aircraft then veered off the runway and hit multiple obstructions before coming to rest in Flushing Bay, just beyond the end of the runway. Of the 51 people on board, 27 were killed, including the captain and a member of the cabin crew.\n\nA similar accident had happened three years before in 1989, when Air Ontario Flight 1363 crashed shortly after takeoff at Dryden Regional Airport after ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. Out of 69 passengers and crew, 24 were killed.\n\nThe subsequent investigation revealed that due to pilot error, inadequate de-icing procedures at LaGuardia, and several lengthy delays, a large amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. This ice disrupted airflow over the jet, increasing drag and reducing lift, which prevented the jet from lifting off the runway. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the flight crew were unaware of the amount of ice that had built up after the jet was delayed by heavy ground traffic taxiing to the runway. The report also listed the fact that the aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a lower speed than was standard as a contributing factor to the accident.\n\nInvestigators also found that the deicing procedures at LaGuardia were substandard. While the jet encountered a delay of up to 35 minutes, they found that the deicing fluid that was being used at the airport, and by the majority of commercial airlines across the United States, was effective for only fifteen minutes. The accident led to a number of studies into the effect that ice has on aircraft, and several recommendations into prevention techniques.\n\nThe jet involved in the accident was a Fokker F28 Series 4000 airplane manufactured in the Netherlands. A two-engine, medium-range jet, the Fokker F28 is designed for transporting up to 95 passengers. The particular jet involved in the accident was registered in the United States as N485US. It was first delivered to Piedmont Airlines in August 1986, and was acquired by USAir (US Airways) —now named American Airlines—three years later in August 1989 when Piedmont and USAir merged. N485US had amassed a total of 12,462 flying hours at the time of the accident.\n\nCaptain Wallace J. Majure II, 44, who was fully qualified to pilot the F28 and four other commercial aircraft, had accumulated approximately 9,820 total flying hours, of which 2,200 hours were in the F28. Majure was initially hired as an F28 first officer by Piedmont Airlines in 1985. He was later reassigned to serve as a first officer and then a captain on a Boeing 737, but finally returned to an F28 captain because of company cutbacks. \"The New York Times\" reported that:\n\nMajure was a man who yearned to please his passengers, and if he made them happy then he also made his airline happy. He had often spoken to friends about how important it was for him to get travelers to their destinations on time and how proud he was of USAir's on-time record. All the same, he was also portrayed as a by-the-book, cautious pilot.\n\nFirst Officer John Rachuba, 30, was hired by Piedmont in 1989. At the time of the accident, company records indicate that he had accumulated approximately 4,507 flying hours, of which 29 hours were in the F28. Rachuba held a flight engineer certificate with ratings for turbojet-powered aircraft and an expired instructor certificate issued on August 16, 1987. He also held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license for non-federal control towers. Previously, he had served as a flight engineer on Boeing 737s and Boeing 727s.\n\nThe two flight attendants were Debra Andrews Taylor and Janice King. Janice King, who was seated in the aft jumpseat, died in the crash.\n\nThe aircraft took off from Jacksonville International Airport, Florida, several hours before the accident, although the departure from Jacksonville was delayed by poor weather over New York and the removal of the baggage of a passenger who decided not to board the jet. The instrument approach landing was uneventful and the jet was not significantly delayed while in the air waiting to land, however congestion on the taxiways at LaGuardia delayed the arrival of the aircraft at the gate.\n\nOne hour and six minutes behind schedule, the jet arrived at Gate B1, where the pilot advised a ground mechanic that his airplane was \"good to go.\" The flight crew then disembarked the jet to use facilities in the terminal. The poor weather did not improve as the jet was deiced with Type I fluid, a heated 50/50 water/glycol mixture. Following the completion of this process, one of the two deicing trucks delayed the pushback of the jet when it experienced mechanical problems. The vehicle was immobilised for 20 minutes in such a position that it prevented the aircraft from taxiing to the runway following the flight crew's return.\n\nAfter the deicing truck was repaired, the pilot requested a second deicing, though the flight crew did not perform a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures did not require them to do so. Following the second deicing, LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission to taxi to Runway 13. The flight crew completed the pre-flight checklist during the taxi.\n\nEngine anti-ice was turned on for the two engines during taxi. The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and they should not be worried seeing them in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as a reminder of the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V speed of 110 knots.\n\nWeather reports for LaGuardia showed that on the night of the accident, all taxiways were coated with a thin covering of snow. Runway 13 was also covered with a thin layer of wet snow, although it had been plowed, treated with urea and it had been sanded.\n\nThe first officer described the snowfall as \"not heavy, no large flakes.\" He told authorities that snow was sliding off the jet and the nose of the airplane was coated in a watery layer. He used a light positioned on the wing of his jet to check for signs of ice several times before they attempted to take off. Neither he or the pilot saw any evidence of contamination on the wing or on the black strip and therefore decided against a third deicing. He told investigators that he checked the wings \"maybe 10 times, but at least 3.\" He said that he did not consider the snowfall heavy, and he did not recall any wind blowing the snow. The first officer stated that as they taxied, they looked back at the wings several times. Near the time of the takeoff, he said \"looks good to me, black strip is clear.\"\n\nWhile taxiing, the flight crew discussed deicing procedures. The first officer suggested to the pilot that the aircraft ahead of them in the queue \"might keep our wings clear for us.\" The pilot replied that \"it can cause us to re-freeze too ... I don't want to be very close to him.\" Later, the first officer remarked \"look at all that stuff. What is that?\" to which the pilot replied \"sand I guess, urea sand.\"\n\nThe pilot of a jet taxiing behind Flight 405, Northwest Airlines Flight 517, a Boeing 757, stated that he had a good view of the top of Flight 405's wing, and that there was just enough snow on the fuselage to \"fuzzy\" the USAir printing but that the wings appeared to be clear. He believed that the snow had \"all but stopped\" and was more concerned about the amount of vehicular traffic, such as sweepers and plows, than he was about the snowfall. The second officer of Trump Shuttle Flight 1541, which had landed around the time Flight 405 was taxiing, said their Boeing 727 had \"picked up a lot of snow quickly during my post-landing walkaround, but by the finish it seemed to be more rain.\" He described Flight 405 as a \"fairly clean airplane.\" He said that he could not comment on clear ice, but that the wings and fuselage were clear of snow.\n\nThe jet, already several hours behind schedule, then suffered further delays taxiing to the runway. The weather had created heavy ground traffic at LaGuardia, and it was reported that there were queues of aircraft waiting for permission for takeoff. Investigators estimated that the plane took between 25 and 45 minutes to taxi from the gate to the runway.\n\nFollowing permission for takeoff from controllers, the flight crew initiated the takeoff procedure and the first officer made a callout of 80 knots, and, several seconds later, a V callout, followed shortly after by a V callout. Approximately 2.2 seconds after the V callout, the nose gear left the ground. The final report read that \"the first officer described the takeoff as normal through the rotation. He stated that no problem was evident with vibration, rate of acceleration, ambient noise, [or] directional control\". However, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"several passengers sensed that [the airplane] was not going fast enough.\"\n\nThe first officer said it was \"just like we lost lift.\" As the captain attempted to level the wings, the crew used right rudder to manoeuvre the aircraft back toward the ground and avoid the water below. The accident report found that \"the first officer said that they seemed to agree that the airplane was not going to fly and that their control inputs were in unison.\" Rachuba and Majure continued to try to hold the nose up to impact in a flat attitude, although Rachuba later stated that there were no \"heavy control inputs.\" The final report further noted that \"first officer stated that he did not touch the power levers.\" The first officer later told investigators that the flight crew's primary focus was to find a safe place to land.\n\nJust under five seconds after the undercarriage left the ground, the plane's left wing scraped against the asphalt for 110 feet and the stick shaker activated. The crew received six stall warnings, before the jet began banking to the left, then to the right, and then to the left again, still only several meters above the ground. The aircraft struck two visual approach slope indicator posts, touched down again for approximately 100 feet, before lifting off again and striking an ILS beacon and a water pump house.\n\nThe left wing then separated from the body of the airplane, before the fuselage struck the edge of Flushing Bay and came to rest in a partially inverted position. Parts of the fuselage and cockpit were submerged in water. Confusion, disorientation, or entrapment most likely caused the drowning of passengers who otherwise sustained only minor injuries and injuries that were not life-threatening. The final report read:\n\nPrior to impact, passengers did not assume the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, many of the passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped through a hole in the cabin floor near the flight attendant's position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.\n\nThe tower cab coordinator on duty at the time of the accident stated that he saw a fireball emanating from the crash site following the accident. Upon seeing the flames, he sounded an alarm, alerting the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police, who responded. An investigation revealed that there were technical issues with an emergency telephone at LaGuardia, however it was found that these issues did not hinder the emergency response.\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department initially sent four vehicles. Personnel in these vehicles reported that snow and fog hampered their visibility while heading to the crash site, and they could not see the destroyed aircraft. However, one member of the fire crew observed people standing on top of a dike near the crash site. Police divers also entered the water following the crash, although they found no-one alive inside the jet or in the water. The fire-fighters continued spraying the fire, and the incident commander estimated that they had the fire under control ten minutes after their arrival at the scene. \"The New York Times\" reported that:\n\nThe accident sent thick black smoke billowing above the airport as more than 200 emergency workers ... had to contend not only with blustery snow but the powerful icy current in Flushing Bay ... the tense drama of the rescue continued into the early hours, with fire-fighters and police officers in water up to their shoulders and helicopters shining spotlights on the wreckage and an ice-covered mound of earth at the end of the runway so slick the rescue workers needed metal ladders to walk across it.\n\nThe NTSB report on the accident noted, but did not criticise, the medical operation at the scene. It described how paramedics attended to those who were conscious with life-threatening injuries, but did not make any attempts to resuscitate victims who appeared drowned or lacked vital signs because they believed that they could not be revived because they had succumbed to the cold salt water. It was estimated by the authorities who attended the scene of the crash that 15 ambulances responded to the accident site, all of which were used to transport the injured to hospitals, and that 40 additional ambulances were available near the site of the crash, but were not needed.\n\nThe report described the emergency response as \"effective and contributed to the survivability of the airplane's occupants. However, the response by the emergency medical services personnel was inadequately coordinated, and the ambulance response times to the hospitals were excessive.\" The final report read:\n\n... a basic principle of triage is to treat victims having the most life-threatening injuries first with available medical resources and to utilize limited medical personnel in a manner that will provide maximum effectiveness. However, the Safety Board is also aware that in recent years a number of victims of cold water drowning have been successfully resuscitated. They survived after periods of underwater, including sea water, as long as one hour or more. In view of these facts, the Safety Board believes that all emergency response organizations should review their emergency plans to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained personnel arrive to perform CPR, even during mass casualty/triage incidents, regardless of whether vital signs are present, especially if cold-water immersion/near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not indicate death.\n\nThe NTSB sent a team to the crash site to investigate the accident. They concluded that, unknown to the crew, ice had collected on the wings, which disrupted airflow and reduced lift.The inquiry lasted just under one year.\n\nThe investigators suggested multiple reasons why the jet was unable to gain lift, but the accident report states there was no evidence to suggest corrosion on the wings. The airplane's flight control systems were also examined and revealed no failure prior to impact. The report reads that \"the evidence did not support improper wing configuration, airframe or system defects, or deployment of the speed brakes as reasons for the loss of aerodynamic efficiency.\" The investigators also stated that the takeoff roll of the jet was not abnormal. The board came to the conclusion that ice had built up on the wings, and this had contributed largely to the accident.\n\nWhen attempting to find out why ice was present on the wings of the jet, the board determined that the airplane had been properly cleared of ice and snow during the two deicing procedures at the gate. However, approximately 35 minutes elapsed between the second time that the aircraft was deiced and the initiation of takeoff during which the airplane was exposed to continuing precipitation in below freezing temperatures. The NTSB were unable to determine how much ice had built up on the wings following the second deicing, but considered it to be highly likely that \"some contamination occurred in the 35 minutes following the second deicing and that this accumulation led to this accident.\"\n\n\"The Safety Board views the evidence as conclusive that the primary factor in this accident was the reduced performance of the wing due to ice contamination. Therefore, the Safety Board evaluated the extent to which the decisions of, and procedures used by the flight crew could have contributed to the accident,\" read the final report. Although, when the cockpit was examined, the engine anti-ice switch was found in the 'OFF' position, further investigations found that even slight pressure could move the switch, and the NTSB ruled this out as a contributing factor in the crash. Following the accident, USAir sent out a maintenance directive ordering engine anti-ice switches to be changed on F28s so they would lock into a selected position.\n\nInvestigators found that a flaw in the design of the F28's wings made them extremely vulnerable to ice buildup. Because of the angle of the wings, even a very small amount of ice could have devastating effects. When the NTSB, in collaboration with Fokker, investigated the effect ice can have on an aircraft, they found that ice particles as small as 1-2mm of a density of one particle per square centimeter can cause a loss of lift of over 20%. A document written by Fokker before the accident detailed the effect of ice on the wing of an F28 warned that an \"uncontrollable roll\" would begin even with a small amount of ice on the wings.\n\nThe report found that the flight crew were aware that the poor weather was likely to cause ice buildup, however neither of them took any action to check the condition of the wing leading edge and upper surface. The aircraft was evaluated by ground crew and was deiced. After the mechanical failure of the deicing truck, the investigators reported that, as the captain requested another deice, there was an indication he was:\n\n... concerned about the continuing exposure to precipitation, and the request was prudent and in accordance with USAir guidance. Following the second deicing, the flight crew was most likely satisfied that the airplane was free of adhering contamination. The flight crew was not aware of the exact delay that they would encounter before takeoff and their decision to leave the gate was reasonable. After taxiing, when it became evident that they would be delayed for a prolonged period, conversations between the crew showed that they were aware of and probably concerned about the risk of reaccumulating frozen contamination on the wing.\nThey also found that USAir guidance and flight crew training was sufficient and should have alerted the flight crew to the risk of attempting a takeoff while they were unaware of the condition of the wing. USAir guidance to flight crews specifically stated that:\n\n... it is the captain's responsibility to exercise caution prior to takeoff. If the elapsed time since deicing exceeds 20 minutes, careful examination of the surfaces should be conducted to detect the extent of accumulation [of ice] and to assure that the takeoff can be made safely and in compliance with existing [regulations].\n\nThe final report read:\n\nThe Safety Board believes that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin to look at the wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board believes that the flight crew's failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.\n\nIn a television interview, one of the NTSB investigators suggested that \"the captain was faced with quite a problem. If he wanted to be deiced a third time, he would have had to get out of the line [of jets waiting to take off] and taxi all the way back to the parking area and meet up with a deicing truck again. That would have put him very, very late and it may have even caused the cancellation of the flight.\"\n\nThe NTSB carried out tests to discover why the first officer was unable to see the ice buildup on the wing of the jet. When the sliding window of the cockpit was fully open, the first officer would have been able to see the outer eighty percent of the wing, including the black strip used to contrast the white surface of the wing so the flight crew can search for a build up of ice. When the sliding window was shut, as it was in the accident, it would be difficult to make out any details of the wing, and the black strip would have been distorted by the glass. They also found that the ice light made little difference to how much the first officer would have been able to see.\n\nThe investigators also requested that Fokker conduct a study of the effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on the F28 aircraft. The NTSB evaluated the data from the tests and found that the pilot initiated the rotation five knots earlier at 119 knots instead of the proper rotation speed of 124 knots. The data from Fokker was correlated with the cockpit voice recording and confirmed that the first officer called a rotation speed of 113 knots but the captain did not rotate until 119 knots. It was never established why the rotation was called and initiated earlier than was standard.\n\nInvestigators also focused on deicing practices at LaGuardia. They found that the airport was using only Type I deicing fluid, not Type II. Type I fluids are used for the actual deicing of the jet, while Type II fluids are used for preventing buildup of ice. At the time of the accident, LaGuardia had prohibited the use of Type II deicing fluid because tests suggested that if it fell onto runways it reduced friction. Investigators noted the change had been made because of LaGuardia's shorter runways and the fact that if an aircraft left the vicinity of the runway, it would come to rest in the cold water surrounding Runway 13. The accident report, however, criticised the fact that the majority of the airplane operators in the United States relied only upon Type I fluids for protection, and they do not use Type II. The board stated that tests have shown that both Type I and Type II fluids do flow off the wings of a treated airplane in significant amounts during the initial takeoff ground run. The NTSB stated:\n\nThere are a number of views on the potential uses of Type I and II fluids. The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than the holdover time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.\n\nWhile it was not named as a cause of the accident, investigators also found that the passenger safety briefing cards in the airplane showed two types of galley service doors. However, only one door is installed on a particular F28 model at any one time. The examination also showed that the safety card did not show how to operate either of the two types of galley service doors in the emergency mode if the normal opening mode failed. However, the final report stated that this \"did not contribute to the fatalities in the accident.\"\n\nThe final report, published by the NTSB, cited the probable cause of the accident to be:\n\n... the failure of the airline industry and the Federal Aviation Administration to provide flight crews with procedures, requirements, and criteria compatible with departure delays in conditions conducive to airframe icing and the decision by the flight crew to take off without positive assurance that the airplane's wings were free of ice accumulation after 35 minutes of exposure to precipitation following de-icing. The ice contamination on the wings resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of control after lift-off. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the inappropriate procedures used by, and inadequate coordination between, the flight crew that led to a takeoff rotation at a lower than prescribed air speed.\n\nThe NTSB made several recommendations to the FAA, including requiring that \"flight crew members and appropriate ground personnel responsible for the inspection of transport-category airplanes for wing contamination receive specific periodic training that will illustrate what contamination looks like and feels like on a wing and the amount of contamination that is detectable under different light conditions\". They also ordered \"airlines to establish a way to inform fight crews of the type of [deicing] fluid and mixture used, the current moisture accumulation rate, and the available holdover time.\"\n\nWith regard to the obstructions that the airplane collided with during the accident sequence, the NTSB ordered the modification or replacement of \"all pump houses adjacent to Runway 13/31 so that they are not obstructions to airplanes\". They also ordered a study on the \"feasibility of building a frangible ILS antenna array for LaGuardia Airport\" Further, they ordered a review of Fokker F28-4000 passenger safety briefing cards \"to ensure that they clearly and accurately depict the operation of the two types of forward cabin doors in both their normal and emergency modes and that they describe clearly and accurately how to remove the overwing emergency exit and cover.\"\n\nThe crash was featured on National Geographic Channel in an episode of the television program \"Mayday\" (\"Air Crash Investigation\"/\"Air Emergency\") entitled \"Cold Case\", where the accident was compared with Air Ontario Flight 1363, which crashed in Dryden, Ontario, after the crew did not deice their jet. The program opened by saying that Canadian investigators were \"stunned\" to hear of the USAir accident, as it mirrored the Air Ontario flight which had occurred three years earlier.\n\nThe report on the crash in Dryden criticised approaches to deicing. It made several points, including recommending the use of Type II deicing fluid rather than Type I, deicing trucks near the runway rather than at the gate, and that the crew should inspect their wings not only from the cockpit, but also the cabin. The report concluded that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of the industry's sloppy practices and questionable procedures were placing pilots in difficult situations.\n\nThe Honourable Virgil P. Moshansky, who investigated the crash in Dryden and wrote the report, appeared in the documentary, alleging that if the recommendations in his report had been followed, the USAir accident could have been prevented. Moshansky told the documentary that his report \"probably sat on somebody's [at the FAA] desk.\" He said \"when I first heard about it I thought, my God, it's Dryden all over again ... certainly if they had followed the recommendations in my report, the F28 crash at LaGuardia could have been averted.\"\n\nAnother investigator into the Air Ontario accident told the documentary that \"after all of this work [investigating the Dryden crash], after all of the efforts, to see it happen again was extremely frustrating.\" The documentary focused largely on these allegations, while also reconstructing the Air Ontario flight and the USAir flight. However, it was reported that the FAA refuted Moshansky's allegations, and they claim that they never received his report.\n\nFollowing the crash of Flight 405 and the Air Ontario accident in Dryden, the FAA began to research methods of improving deicing practices at airports to minimise the number of accidents caused by a buildup of ice.\n\nDescribed by the FAA as a \"sharply focused effort\", experts convened on May 28 and 29, 1992, in Reston, Virginia for the International Conference on Ground Deicing. At the conference, industry methods were discussed and agreed upon for actions that should be taken in the long term and short term. A report on the conference by the FAA read:\n\nA better understanding of airplane ground deicing and anti-icing issues is a crucial prerequisite to the implementation of feasible and effective safety improvements. To achieve this goal, the FAA sponsored a conference at which the international aviation community could exchange thoughts and offer recommendation on a variety of issues concerning safe winter operations. [At the conference] more than 750 participants discussed the problems posed by aircraft deicing and examined possible solutions.\nIt was reported that discussions over different types of deicing fluid were discussed, along with different deicing equipment and techniques. They also found that the pilot in command was the ultimate authority for take off decisions, but that all operators had to provide proper training and criteria for the pilot in command to base a proper decision on.\n\nThe conference concluded with an amendment to FAA regulations which air carriers operated under. The new regulations stated that airlines should put in place FAA-approved ground deicing or anti-icing procedures anytime weather conditions of ice, snow or frost prevailed. The new rules went into effect on November 1, 1992.\n\nIn the years that followed the accident, airlines started using Type IV deicing fluid, which is more effective than both Type I and Type II fluids. Type IV fluids stick to aircraft for up to two hours. Chicago O'Hare International Airport was the first to introduce deicing facilities at the runway, something which has now become commonplace.\n\nAircraft themselves now have more sophisticated deicing systems that can be used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.\nGround deicing technologies are also developing, and a newer technology is infrared deicing. This is the transmission of energy by means of electromagnetic waves or rays. Infrared is invisible and travels in straight lines from the heat source to surfaces and objects without significantly heating the space (air) it passes through. When infrared waves strike an object, they release their energy as heat. This heat is either absorbed or reflected by the cooler surface. Infrared energy is continually exchanged between \"hot\" and \"cold\" surfaces until all surfaces have reached the same temperature (equilibrium). The colder the surfaces, the more effective the infrared transfer from the emitter. This heat transfer mechanism is substantially faster than conventional heat transfer modes used by conventional deicing (convection and conduction) due to the cooling effect of the air on the deicing fluid spray.\n\nAircraft deicing vehicles have also improved since the accident, usually consisting of a large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip to take place in a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was a licensed version by Avro of the Fokker F.VIIB/3m.\n\nIn 1928 Avro came to an arrangement with Fokker to license production of its successful F.VIIB/3m for sale in the British Empire (except Canada). The Avro designation 618 Ten was adopted as the aircraft was capable of carrying two crew and eight passengers. After a modification of the centre motor mounting to accommodate British airworthiness requirements, the aircraft was first displayed at the 1929 Olympia Aero Show. The Avro 642 Eighteen used the same wing as the Ten but had a new fuselage for 16 passengers.\n\nThe first five aircraft were sold to the new Australian National Airways. The type entered service on 1 January 1930 on the Brisbane-Sydney route, and later Melbourne-Sydney. They were:\n\nTwo of this fleet were lost in accidents: \"Southern Cloud\" in the Toolong range of the Australian Alps on 21 March 1931 (the wreckage was not found until 1958) and \"Southern Sun\" in Malaya in November 1931, while attempting the first airmail flight to the United Kingdom. The airline folded and the remaining aircraft were sold.\n\n\"Southern Moon\" was rebuilt in 1933 for long-range flights, fitted with 330 hp (250 kW) Wright Whirlwind radial engines and restyled as \"VH-UXX Faith in Australia\". The last surviving 618 Ten in Australia, it evacuated many people from New Guinea in 1941. Another two 618 Ten aircraft were also sold to Australian companies. Three of the 619 Five aircraft went to two Australian airlines, as did (after commercial service in Britain) the sole 642/2m.\n\nFour 618 Tens were delivered directly to British customers. Two went to Imperial Airways (April and June 1931) and were chartered to the Iraq Petroleum Transport Company before returning to Britain in 1933. One went to Midland & Scottish Air Ferries (May 1933) and at the end of 1931 one went to Indian State Airways for the use of the Viceroy of India. Two Tens went to the Egyptian Army air force in January 1932, one of them surviving to join Indian National Airways in September 1934. The last production Ten was delivered to the Royal Aircraft Establishment's Wireless and Equipment Flight in July 1936 with the RAF serial \"K2682\". One of the 624 Sixes was used by A.S.T Ltd; the other two were eventually sold to the Chinese government.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable pilots\n\n"}

Gardner (January 5, 1884 - January 10, 1940) was an American criminal active during the 1920s. He stole a total of more than $350,000 in cash and securities and several times escaped from custody. He is said to have been the most hunted man in Pacific Coast history, having had a $5,000 reward for his head three times in less than a year, and newspapers in the West referred to him as the \"Smiling Bandit\", the \"Mail Train Bandit\", and the \"King of the Escape Artists\" He is a former prisoner of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary (1934-38)..https://www.alcatrazhistory.com/gardner.htm\n\nRoy Gardner was born on January 5, 1884, in Trenton, Missouri, and was raised in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He was said to be attractive and charming, standing just under six feet tall, with short, curly auburn hair and blue eyes. He spent his early manhood as a drifter in the Southwest, learning the trades of farrier and miner. Supposedly he joined the U.S. Army but deserted in 1906 and drifted to Mexico. He was married and had a daughter.\n\nGardner began his criminal profession as a gunrunner around the time of the Mexican Revolution. He smuggled and traded arms and ammunition to the Venustiano Carranza forces until he was captured by soldiers from Victoriano Huerta's army and was sentenced to death by firing squad; however, on March 29, 1909, he broke out of the Mexico City jail along with three other American prisoners after attacking the soldier guards. Back in the United States, Gardner became a prizefighter in the Southwest. He was good enough that he became a sparring partner for Heavyweight Champion J. J. Jeffries at Ben Lemond Training Camp in Reno, Nevada, during the summer of 1910.\n\nEventually, Gardner ended up in San Francisco, where he gambled all of his boxing money away and then robbed a jewelry store on Market Street. He was arrested and spent some time in San Quentin, but was paroled after he saved a prison guard's life during a riot. He then landed a job as an acetylene welder at the Mare Island Navy Yard, married, fathered a daughter, and on Armistice Day in 1918 left and began his own welding company.\n\nOn a business trip to Mexico, Gardner gambled all his money away at the racetracks in Tijuana. Then on the night of April 16, 1920, outside San Diego, he robbed a U. S. Mail truck of about $80,000 in cash and securities. The job went smoothly, but he was arrested three days later while burying his loot. He was sentenced to 25 years at McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary for the armed robbery, but vowed he would never serve the sentence. On June 5, 1920, he was being transported by train, accompanied by Deputy U. S. Marshals Cavanaugh and Haig. Some way outside Portland, Oregon, he peered out of the train window and yelled, \"Look at that deer!\". The lawmen looked, and Gardner grabbed Haig's gun from his holster, then disarmed Cavanaugh at gunpoint, handcuffed the two together, and stole $200. He jumped off the train and made his way to Canada.\n\nHe slipped back into the United States the next year, and started robbing banks and mail trains across the country as a lone bandit. Returning to California, on May 19, 1921, he tied up the mail clerk on Train No. 10 eastbound from Sacramento and robbed the express car of $187,000. The next morning, he told the mail clerk of Train No. 20 to throw up his hands or he would blow his head off. When the train reached the Overland Limited at Roseville, he ran down the tracks with an armful of mail. The home office recognized the gunman as Roy Gardner, the train robber with a $5,000 reward on his head.\n\nGardner was recognized at the Porter House Hotel and while he was playing a game of cards in a pool hall, federal agents arrived and captured him. He was sentenced to another 25 years at McNeil Island for armed robbery of the mail trains.\n\nTrying to reduce his sentence, he told Southern Pacific Railroad detectives that he would lead them to the spot where he buried his loot. The officers found nothing, and Gardner announced, \"I guess I have forgotten where I buried that money.\" He was heavily shackled, with the addition of an \"Oregon Boot\", and was once again transported on a train to McNeil Island, this time by U. S. Marshals Mulhall and Rinkell, both fast-shooting veterans. During the journey, Gardner asked to use the bathroom, in which an associate had earlier hidden a .32 caliber pistol. When he came out of the bathroom, Gardner pointed the gun at Mulhall and ordered another prisoner to handcuff the two lawmen to the seat. He relieved the officers of their weapons and cash before hopping onto another moving train outside Castle Rock, Washington.\n\nThe largest manhunt in Pacific Coast history began after this. Gardner was described as a dangerous man who would shoot on sight and must be captured at all costs. He once again had a $5,000 reward on his head.\n\nHe arrived in Centralia, Washington, where he was almost recognized by Jack Scuitto at the Olympic Club. Gardner plastered his face with bandages to hide his identity, leaving one eye slit, and told the Oxford Hotel staff that he had been severely burned in an industrial accident near Tacoma. Proprietor Gertrude Howell and Officer Louis Sonney became suspicious of the bandaged man, and when Sonney saw a firearm in Gardner's hotel room, he accused him of being the \"Smiling Bandit\". Gardner fought back, but was arrested and a doctor removed the bandages, confirming his identity. He was sentenced to another 25 years, and heavily chained, was finally brought to McNeil Island.\n\nAfter six weeks at the penitentiary, Gardner had convinced two other prisoners, Lawardus Bogart and Everett Impyn, that he had \"paid off\" the guards in the towers. On Labor Day, September 5, 1921, at a prison baseball game, he said \"Now!\" during the fifth inning when someone hit a fly ball into center field, as the guards in the towers had their eyes on the ball and the runners. He, Bogart, and Impyn ran 300 yards to the high barbed-wire fence where Gardner cut a hole, and the three men ran to the pasture as bullets whirled about their heads. Gardner was wounded in his left leg, but escaped behind a herd of cattle near timber. He saw Bogart fall, badly wounded. Impyn was shot dead; his dying words were, \"Gardner told us those fellows in the towers couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.\" Bogart later said that Gardner had deceived them and used his companions as decoys to better his chances of escape.\n\nGuards scoured the beaches and confiscated every boat on the shoreline, but were unable to find Gardner, who lived in the prison barn, drinking milk from the cows, and then swam to Fox Island, where he lived off fruit in the orchards. Warden Maloney claimed Gardner was still on McNeil Island, but by that time Gardner had already left. A San Francisco newspaper published a letter from him.\n\nGardner was now the \"Most Wanted\" criminal, and committed several crimes in Arizona before he was captured by a mail clerk during a train robbery in Phoenix in fall 1921. He was sentenced to an additional 25 years, this time at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. Headlines read: \"Gangster Gardner brags, 'Leavenworth will never hold me'\".\n\nNow known as the \"King of the Escape Artists\", Gardner was transferred in 1925 to Atlanta Federal Prison, then the toughest prison in the country. The following year, he tried to tunnel under the wall and saw through the bars in the shoe shop. Then in 1927, he led a prison break during which he held the captain and two guards hostage with two revolvers, but the escape failed and he was placed in solitary confinement for twenty months. When he was released from solitary confinement, he was placed in a mental hospital in Washington, D. C.\n\nIn 1929, the warden described Gardner as the \"most dangerous inmate in the history of Atlanta Prison\", and that year he began a hunger strike protesting prison food and threatened suicide. He was then transferred to Leavenworth Annex Prison in 1930, and in 1934 he was transferred to Alcatraz, where he was one of the first hardened criminals incarcerated there.\n\nGardner's time in Alcatraz coincided with Al Capone's. Capone was an unpopular prisoner. Supposedly, an unidentified inmate once threw a lead sash weight at Capone, but Capone was only wounded in the arm because Gardner pushed him out of the way.\n\nDuring Gardner's time in Alcatraz, his wife divorced him. He worked and supervised at the mat shop with Ralph Roe and they planned an escape, but Gardner was paroled and released in 1938 after his appeal for clemency was approved.\nIn 1939 Gardner published his autobiography, titled \"Hellcatraz\". He attended crime lectures, and he and Louis Sonney made one of the first re-enactments, a short film called \"You Can't Beat the Rap\". Gardner worked as a film salesman and an exposition barker. A 1939 movie called \"I Stole a Million\" was based on his life; it was a failure.\n\nOn the evening of January 10, 1940, in a hotel room in San Francisco, Gardner wrote four notes; one of them he attached to the door, warning: \"Do not open door. Poison gas. Call police.\" He sealed the door from the inside, then killed himself by dropping cyanide into a glass of acid and inhaling the poison fumes.\n\n"}

The company's games were sold under the \"Swedish Erotica\" banner, although they were programmed in the United States, and manufactured in Hong Kong.\n\n\"I just don't believe adults want to shoot down rocket ships\", American Multiple Industries' president said. According to industry watchers and critics, Mystique's game designs were generally simple, with crude graphics and unexceptional gameplay.\n\nMystique's game \"Custer's Revenge\" gained particular notoriety for its plot. In the game, the player controls the character of \"Custer,\" a naked man sporting a cowboy hat and a visible erection, obviously inspired by George Armstrong Custer. Custer has to overcome various obstacles in order to have sex with a crudely depicted, large-breasted Native American woman who is tied to a cactus. The game prompted complaints from a number of groups—women's rights, anti-pornography, Native American, and video game critics all made complaints.\n\nMystique went out of business during the video game crash of 1983. The rights to Mystique's games were sold to the Playaround spin-off company, which continued the pornographic game line.\n\n"}
{"id": "1918807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918807", "title": "Utopia (band)", "text": "Utopia (band)\n\nUtopia was an American rock band formed in 1973 by Todd Rundgren. During its first three years, the group was a progressive rock band with a somewhat fluid membership known as Todd Rundgren's Utopia. Most of the members in this early incarnation also played on Rundgren's solo albums of the period up to 1975. By 1976, the group was known simply as Utopia and was a stable quartet of Todd Rundgren, Kasim Sulton, Roger Powell and John \"Willie\" Wilcox. This version of the group gradually abandoned prog-rock for straightforward rock and pop.\n\nIn 1980, they had a top 40 hit with \"Set Me Free\". Though often thought of as a Rundgren-oriented project, all four members of Utopia wrote, sang, produced and performed on their albums; \"Set Me Free\", for example, was sung by Sulton. The group broke up in 1986, but reunited briefly in 1992. More recently, beginning in 2011 the earlier prog-rock incarnation known as Todd Rundgren's Utopia was revived for a series of live shows. In 2018 Rundgren, Sulton, and Wilcox reunited for a tour with new keyboardist Gil Assayas under the moniker Todd Rundgren's Utopia.\n\nFor a short period of time (1973–74) Todd Rundgren's Utopia consisted of Rundgren plus Hunt and Tony Sales together with David Mason and Jean-Yves Labat (who at first played rhythm guitars). (The late Mason, a musician from Gainesville, Florida, was not to be confused with the former member of Traffic of the same name.) However, the lineup had changed by the time the band recorded its first release.\n\nThe first two albums — \"Todd Rundgren's Utopia\" (1974) and \"Another Live\" (1975) — featured lengthy, complex and highly arranged progressive rock pieces, performed by a six-piece multi-instrumentalist ensemble. It was originally composed of Rundgren (guitar and vocals), Kevin Ellman (drums and percussion), Mark \"Moogy\" Klingman (keyboards), Jean-Yves \"M. Frog\" Labat (now on synthesizers), Ralph Schuckett (keyboards), and John Siegler (bass and cello). Klingman had played with Rundgren as early as his first album \"Runt\"; both Klingman and Siegler had played on tracks on Side 4 of Rundgren's third album \"Something/Anything\", and together with Schuckett they had also played on Rundgren's fourth album \"A Wizard, A True Star\". Meanwhile, Rundgren had played on Labat's solo album \"M. Frog\". Ellman debuted with Rundgren on the album \"Todd.\"\n\nThe debut album itself contained only four tracks and ran for almost sixty minutes total, opening with \"Utopia Theme\" - recorded live in concert - and closing with the extended concept piece \"The Ikon\", which ran more than thirty minutes and took up all of side two of the album. Soon after this first album was completed, Labat left the band. This remaining five-piece lineup was referred to by Rundgren as the \"Rhythm Kings\" and recorded the song \"Real Man\", later released on Rundgren's 1975 album \"Initiation\", along with other Rundgren solo material. Shortly, though, former Moog programmer Roger Powell joined the band on synthesizer, restoring it to a sextet, but then Ellman left the band to become an executive at his family's Beefsteak Charlie's restaurant chain. Ellman was replaced by John \"Willie\" Wilcox, who had been the drummer with Hall & Oates on the Rundgren-produced \"War Babies\" album.\n\nThe live LP \"Another Live\" (1975) featured new members Powell and Wilcox. The record showcased several extended progressive tracks which were not released in studio versions and also displayed Rundgren's continuing interest in the Broadway musical via a version of \"Something's Coming\" from \"West Side Story\". Also included was a cover of \"Do Ya\", written by Jeff Lynne and originally recorded by The Move; the liner notes characterized this recording as a return gesture for the Move's having covered \"Open My Eyes\", a song written by Rundgren and recorded by his earlier band the Nazz. However, shortly after these sessions, Schuckett and Klingman both left the band, leaving Powell as the lone keyboard player.\n\nOn October 9, 1975, Utopia played their first UK concert at the Hammersmith Odeon in London with the trimmed-down lineup of Rundgren, Siegler, Powell and Wilcox, with backing vocals by future soul star Luther Vandross and Anthony Hinton (a former member of Vandross' early 1970s vocal quintet Luther). This concert was recorded by the BBC for broadcast and has since been widely bootlegged. The audio material from this concert was released in 2012 on Floating World Records' \"Todd Rundgren's Utopia Live at Hammersmith Odeon '75\".\n\nIn 1976, the Rundgren/Powell/Siegler/Wilcox lineup of Utopia recorded an instrumental album entitled \"Disco Jets\", which included a disco arrangement of the \"Star Trek\" theme as well as original compositions. Bearsville Records passed on releasing the album, and it was shelved. (\"Disco Jets\" eventually surfaced in 2001 as part of a Rundgren rarities box set, and was finally issued on its own in 2012.) The same lineup recorded Rundgren's 1976 solo album \"Faithful\". Siegler left the group shortly after the recording of this album.\n\nSiegler, Schuckett, and Klingman were among the many musicians who played with Rundgren for the concerts recorded and released as the live double-LP set \"Back to the Bars\" in 1978.\n\nBy mid-1976, the group became known simply as 'Utopia' and settled into a four-person lineup of Rundgren (guitar, vocals), Kasim Sulton (bass, vocals), Roger Powell (keyboards, vocals) and Willie Wilcox (drums, vocals). This line-up remained stable until the group's demise. All four band members wrote, sang, produced and even engineered material for the band.\n\nThe first Utopia album \"Ra\" (1977) continued showcasing the group's progressive leanings, opening with an electronic arrangement of the \"Overture: Mountaintop and Sunrise\" theme (from Bernard Herrmann's score for the film \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\"), but it also contained several shorter, more accessible songs. Utopia's subsequent albums increasingly featured more concise and pop-oriented material that showed the influence of the prevailing new wave trend.\n\n1977's \"Oops! Wrong Planet\" was an even more pop-oriented album, and the song \"Love Is the Answer\" became Utopia's main set-closer. \"Love Is the Answer\" later became a big hit for England Dan & John Ford Coley, charting No. 1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary list in 1979, but the Utopia version failed to chart.\n\nUtopia had only one \"Billboard\" top 40 hit: \"Set Me Free\", from their best-selling album \"Adventures in Utopia\" (1979), peaking at No. 27 in the US in early 1980. The same year, the band issued the LP \"Deface the Music\", which was an overt pastiche of the Merseybeat and Sgt. Pepper-era music of The Beatles. Though the album received some positive critical notices, the move away from new wave derailed the band's career momentum.\n\nUtopia managed to hold on to their cult status throughout the '80s with their albums, concert performances and videos that were shown on MTV in its early years. The group had a number of album-oriented rock hits including \"Caravan,\" \"Feet Don't Fail Me Now\" (co-written by bassist Doug Howard, who replaced Sulton during his brief hiatus from the group in 1982), and \"Love In Action.\" The video for \"Feet Don't Fail Me Now\" memorably featured the band dressed in insect costumes. The album \"Swing to the Right\" (1982) featured satirical political songs, and the Canadian top 40 hit \"One World\", but its primary purpose was to fulfill the band's recording contract with Bearsville Records, which had stopped promoting the group, concluding that Utopia albums had a guaranteed audience of Rundgren fans but weren't likely to attract new listeners. While the band was without a label, Sulton decided to leave the band and was replaced by Doug Howard; however, once the band signed with Network Records (a subsidiary of Elektra Records), Sulton decided to return and Howard left.\n\nThe follow-up self-titled LP \"Utopia\" (1982) was the band's first album for Network and spread 15 tracks across an LP and a bonus unlisted EP. In addition, a video album was released. Unfortunately during this time Elektra/Asylum records decided to move their offices from New York to Los Angeles. During the consolidation they decided to cut Network Records out of its distribution causing the label to fold and left Utopia without label support once again. Utopia then signed a three-album deal with Passport Records, then a subsidiary of Jem Records.\n\nThe band's final two albums \"Oblivion\" (1984) and \"POV\" (1985) were neither commercially successful, nor critically well-received, partly because the Passport label on which they were issued folded. After issuing the compilation \"Trivia\" in 1986, which included tracks from their previous three LPs plus two previously released outtakes, Utopia called it quits.\n\nRundgren had a successful solo career before, during, and after Utopia, as did his bandmates, although to more modest levels. Powell toured with David Bowie for the live album \"Stage\", and previously worked as protégé for Robert Moog. Powell's solo album \"Air Pocket\" was voted No. 1 in 1980 by \"Keyboard Magazine\", but after the demise of Utopia he had to give up performing for some time due to Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). Prior to Utopia, Wilcox recorded the Rundgren-produced \"War Babies\" album and toured with Hall and Oates. Wilcox was the senior composer and sound designer for NBC Universal Television from 1999–2005, and wrote and programmed \"We Connect\", the No. 1 dance hit for artist Stacey Q. He continues to write and produce for television, film and artists with his company Willie Wilcox Music. Wilcox composed the ringwalk music used by the boxer, Manny Pacquiao. Bassist Kasim Sulton issued a solo LP in 1982, which contained the Canadian top 40 hit \"Don't Break My Heart\", and has toured as a band leader for Meat Loaf, and performed with Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Scandal, Hall and Oates, Blue Öyster Cult, and others.\n\nThough Utopia officially broke up in 1986, they reunited briefly in 1992, yielding the album, \"\", but they were unable to secure a new label arrangement so they disbanded permanently. Various members have continued to work with Rundgren in the intervening years. In 2005, Rundgren and Sulton began working together again in a new lineup of The Cars using the name The New Cars. After Elliot Easton broke his left clavicle following a tour bus accident, The New Cars took a hiatus. During this hiatus, Kasim took on some work with Meat Loaf and Rundgren to support \"\".\n\nRundgren, Powell, and Sulton were reunited on stage during the debut live presentation of Rundgren's \"A Wizard, a True Star\" presented by RundgrenRadio.com in 2009. Due to ongoing health issues with hearing loss and arthritis (which had precipitated his retirement from performing in the 1990s) Powell did not participate in the extended tour, for which he was replaced by founding member Ralph Schuckett, continuing the trend of former Utopia members to remain connected musically. \n\nOn January 29–30, 2011, a reunion of most of the members of the 1974 Utopia Mark II band (Rundgren, Moogy Klingman, Ralph Shuckett, John Siegler, and Kevin Ellman) was held for two nights at the Highline Ballroom in New York City. Proceeds from the shows went to defray medical treatment for Klingman's bout with cancer. Material was drawn from the 1972–75 catalogs of Rundgren and Todd Rundgren's Utopia. This marked the first time this lineup performed together in over 35 years. Fellow musicians Jesse Gress and longtime Utopia (1977–86) member Kasim Sulton performed on some of the songs.\n\nTen months later, in November 2011, the band toured live as \"Todd Rundgren's Utopia\" for the first time since 1975, with the same lineup of Rundgren, Klingman, Schuckett, Siegler, Ellman, Gress and Sulton. Klingman died on November 15, 2011.\n\nIn late 2017, Sulton put together a Utopia tribute band called Kasim Sulton's Utopia, made up of himself, Jesse Gress (guitar and vocals), Wade Preston (piano and vocals), Christopher Clark (synth and vocals) and Andy Ascolese (drums and vocals). This grouping began touring in February 2018. Also in February 2018, Utopia announced it would be touring as \"Todd Rundgren's Utopia\" starting that spring, with a lineup of Rundgren, Sulton, Wilcox, and Schuckett. In March 2018, the band announced that Schuckett would not be able to participate and called for keyboardists who are familiar with Utopia's catalog to submit audition tapes. The band ultimately chose Gil Assayas after one of Rundgren's sons saw him perform.\n\n\n\nThe discography of American progressive rock band Utopia includes ten studio albums, four live albums, four compilations, and three singles that charted on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\n\n\n"}

His father was a member of the former Korean aristocracy and a military officer serving the Joseon Dynasty, who became a Zen priest after the Japanese annexation of Korea, and subsequently committed suicide when Tachihara was age five.\n\nFour years after his father's death in 1931, Tachihara moved with his mother to Yokosuka city, Kanagawa prefecture, Japan. His Korean name was Kim Yun Kyu (金胤奎: 김윤규), but he changed his name to ' when his mother married a Japanese man. Later, he registered his name as Kanai Masaaki under the \"soushi-kaimei\" policy, but after his own marriage (to a Japanese woman), he once again changed his name to '. He has been naturalized in Japan in 1947.\n\nHe was a student at Waseda University in Tokyo, and was initially enrolled in the Law Department. However, he gradually shifted over the Literature Department, drawn by his interest in the novels of Yasunari Kawabata and the literary criticism of Hideo Kobayashi.\n\nTachihara was strongly attracted to medieval Japanese culture, particularly Noh drama, and traditional Japanese gardens, and his novels are patterned after the aesthetics in Zeami's Noh treatise \"Fushi Kaiden\". Tachihara's interests included the collection of ceramics, especially many Korean Yi Dynasty works. It was not until after his death that his Korean ethnic background became widely known.\n\nTachihara's first novel, \"Bakushū\" (“Autumn Wheat”) was published in the literary magazine \"Bungei kenkyūkai\". It was well received by literary critics, which led to his decision to become a professional writer. In 1958, he published \"Tanin no jiyū\" (“Other People's Freedom”) in the magazine \"Gunzō\", followed by \"Takigi nō\" (“Firelight Noh”), \"Tsurugigasaki\" (“Cape Tsurugi”) and \"Urushi no hana\" (“Lacquer Flower”).\n\nHe won the 55th Naoki Award for his novel \"Shiroi keshi\" (“White Poppy”, 1965).

{"id": "1918835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918835", "title": "Aitape", "text": "Aitape\n\nAitape is a small town of about 18,000 people on the north coast of Papua New Guinea in the Sandaun Province. It is a coastal settlement that is almost equidistant from the provincial capitals of Wewak and Vanimo, and marks the midpoint of the highway between these two capitals. Aitape has 240 V power (in general 24 hours), telephone, a bank, a post-office, a courthouse and a police station, a supermarket and many tradestores, a petrol station, two airstrips, two secondary schools, a mission office and a hospital.\n\nAitape was established as a train station by German colonists in 1905 as part of German New Guinea. During the Second World War the town was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nAitape can be reached by logging road from Vanimo and Wewak (180 km). Boats also leave Aitape Harbor to Vanimo and Wewak.\n\nThere are two airstrips: Tadji (TAJ), where most flights land, and Aitape (ATP). Tadji airstrip is located 10 km east of town.\n\nFirst contact between the Aitape (Eitape) area and the outside world is believed to have occurred during the 15th century when large sailing expeditions arrived from China. It is certain that Malay fishing fleets were active along the Sepik coastline from the early 17th century when island inhabitants were recruited as navigators for these Malay fishing vessels. The first Christian missionary arrived in the Aitape area in 1896. It was \"Societatis Verbi Divini\" (the Society of the Divine Word or SVD) from Germany and Holland. The first mission station was established on the island of Tumleo in 1896. A second station was set up at Pro on the mainland the following year. The inhabitants of Pro requested that the mission station be established to protect them from raids by much larger settlements. The major native settlements at the time were at Sissano, Malol, and Arop (the Siau group). The island settlements of Tumleo, Ali and Seleo (the Bakla) made up the next group of main settlements. Both the Siau and Bakla would band together annually for major trading expeditions taking in the Aitape coastline to the south east areas around Wewak.\n\nGerman authorities found it difficult to colonize the Siau and Bakla of the Aitape area. The Aitape area was officially described as uncontrolled during the German colonial period. Still, the Germans built a solid prison at Aitape and installed a powerful radio station which maintained quality communication with Europe.\n\nIn 1908, the Aitape coastline was struck by a major tsunami event resulting in the collapse of an area of coastline between Arop and Sissano creating the Sissano Lagoon. (A second tsunami struck in 1935 with most recent occurring in 1998 also hitting Sissano.)\n\nBy 1914 there were 68 missionaries and 6 new stations established along the coast. The town along with the rest of German New Guinea passed to Australian control after the First World War and became part of the Territory of New Guinea.\n\nDuring the Second World War the town was occupied, along with the rest of the Territory of New Guinea, by the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nDuring the recapture American forces bypassed the Japanese 18th Army based at Wewak, taking Aitape on 22 April 1944. A base was developed here and repulsed a major Japanese counter-attack. The Americans were content to hold Aitape and not advance far towards Wewak. In fact, Aitape was captured as part of a 3-pronged invasion by the Allies (Aitape, and landings on either side of Hollandia). There was little or no strategic gain to be had in doing so as the Japanese force based at Wewak no longer posed a real threat – cut off, short of supplies, and weakened from battle and diseases. In mid-1944, General Douglas MacArthur, the American Commander-in-Chief of Allied forces in the South-West Pacific Area, secured an agreement from the Australian government for Australian forces to take over at Aitape. MacArthur then continued island hopping in preparation for the re-capture of the Philippines.\n\nThe Aitape-Wewak campaign was the final Australian military campaign on mainland New Guinea. It ran from November 1944 to the war's end in August 1945. It was fought by the 6th Division, Australian Imperial Force (AIF) with air and naval support.\n\nAustralian intelligence soldier Leonard Siffleet was beheaded by Japanese on Aitape beach 24 October 1943 .\n\nIn July 1998, the area surrounding the town suffered from a destructive tsunami that killed over 2,000 people. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurred offshore and triggered a large undersea landslide that generated the tsunami. The area worst hit was Warapu village about 8 km west of Aitape. The village was situated on a narrow spit between the coast and a large lagoon. It is estimated that waves with an average height of 10.5 metres passed over the spit into the lagoon.\n\n"}

He was ordained in 1959 and became a priest of the diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts.\n\nPorter was assigned to St. Mary's parochial grammar school in North Attleboro, Massachusetts in April 1960 and put in charge of the altar boys. Porter gained a reputation there as a child molester, but no action was taken against him by the Catholic Church until 1963, by which time at least four parents had complained to his superiors about his inappropriate behavior. Rather than contact the police, however, Church officials moved Porter to a parish in Fall River, where further complaints about his behavior surfaced. In the early 1960s, Porter abused more than 60 North Attleboro children, and nearly 100 in southeastern Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1964, Porter was arrested for molesting a 13-year-old boy and sent to a mental institution for 13 months. Once released, he was quickly reassigned to another parish, the first of many such reassignments over the years. He was shuffled into two more parishes before more accusations piled up and he was hospitalized again in 1967, this time to a hospital run by fellow priests who practiced holistic psychotherapy upon its patients, many of whom were clergy members suffering from psychological problems. Porter's \"problem\" was not unique among the hospital's patients; two of them were later imprisoned for abusing, between them, hundreds of children.\n\nPorter was released after a few months, once again declared cured, and given probationary assignments in parishes in Texas, New Mexico and Minnesota, all of which included access to children. Complaints surfaced by the dozen against Porter, but none of them resulted in disciplinary action beyond his being moved from post to post.\n\nIn 1973, Porter wrote a letter to Pope Paul VI requesting to be released from the priesthood, in which he admitted molesting children across five states. The Pope granted his request and, in 1974, Porter gave up his collar. He married, and eventually settled in Minnesota. He and his wife, Verlyne (née Bartlett), had four children. Following Porter's arrest years later, his family revealed that he was often emotionally and physically abusive toward them; Porter’s son Sean also told authorities \nthat his father had sexually abused him.\n\nIn 1990, Frank Fitzpatrick went public with accusations that Porter had molested him as a child in the '60s. Over the next two years, Fitzpatrick contacted the state police, the FBI, and the media. No one agreed to help him. He eventually reached attorney Roderick MacLeish, who had won a large sexual abuse case that year. MacLeish agreed to take the case on. He arranged for Fitzpatrick and five other Porter victims to talk to Joe Bergantino, an investigative reporter for WBZ-TV. Bergantino's piece attracted nation news and eventually more than 100 victims came forward to accuse Porter. The Boston Globe published more than 100 articles about the case. In 1992, a series of investigative reports by ABC News producer Grace Kahng on Porter's crimes aired on \"Primetime Live\", hosted by Diane Sawyer, which sparked national attention.\n\nThe initial ABC News Primetime Live broadcast revealed Porter had abused over 100 children in Massachusetts. Sawyer interviewed 30 adults who had been raped as elementary school children by Porter. The investigation and documents obtained by MacLeish revealed that instead of removing Porter after parents reported the abuse, the Catholic Church had moved him to a treatment center and then to Bemidji, Minnesota, where he continued to rape dozens of children. \"Primetime Live\" interviewed 30 of Porter's victims and their parents, and confronted the priest who had transferred Porter from Massachusetts to Minnesota knowing of his crimes. They also contacted Porter himself, who still had contact with children as a Sunday school teacher at his church. The ABC News investigation discovered and interviewed a local babysitter who said Porter had sexually abused her in 1984. After the report aired, it was discovered that Porter had also molested the babysitter's younger sister, a crime that was within the statute of limitations. This development allowed local Minnesota authorities to finally arrest Porter. Before Porter's arrest, Sawyer and her producer confronted the former priest at a local carnival.\n\nWithin weeks of the ABC News broadcast, Porter was arrested, tried and convicted of sexually abusing his children's babysitter. He served four months of a six-month prison sentence before his conviction was overturned by the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n\nThe Porter case caused a national outcry and the U.S. Conference of Bishops adopted new guidelines for handling priests charged with child molestation.\n\nBy 1993, dozens of lawsuits had cropped up against Porter in Minnesota, Texas and New Mexico; in Minnesota alone, he was charged with over 200 counts of sexual abuse. Porter's lawyer struck a plea bargain, and Porter was sentenced to 18–20 years in prison, with the possibility of parole, with counseling, after six years. Parole was consistently denied for several years. He completed his prison sentence in 2004, but was held until his death pending a civil commitment hearing.\n\nPorter died February 11, 2005, of cancer at New England Medical Center in Boston, where he had been transferred the month before from a Massachusetts hospital.\n\nThe 1995 \"Law & Order\" episode \"Bad Faith\" and the 2010 \"\" episode \"Confession\" were based on Porter's case. His crimes were also referenced in the 2015 film \"Spotlight\".\n"}

On 12 June 2017, it was announced that \"Salatut elämät\" will be on the air until the summer 2023 making the series the longest-lasting drama series of all time in Finland. The series' storylines follow the daily lives of several families who live in the same apartment block in Helsinki. The series primarily centres on the residents of Pihlajakatu and its neighbouring areas. Only six of the original twenty characters Ismo (Esko Kovero), Kalle (Pete Lattu), Ulla (Maija-Liisa Peuhu), Aki (Sami Uotila), Kari (Tommi Taurula) and Elina (Inna Tähkänen, originally played by Sanna Luostarinen) still remain in the series, and most of the series' current characters have made their debuts in 2014 or later.\n\nMTV3 also airs reruns of the series every weekend (Monday-Wednesday episodes on Saturday, Thursday-Friday episodes on Sunday). In the summer, the channel airs reruns of the series; in the summer of 2014, episodes from the season 2009–2010 were aired.\n\nEight web spin-off series have been made; \"Romeo & Rafael Desperados\" in 2008, \"Lillukanvarsia\" in 2010–2011, \"Tuuliranta\" in 2011–2012, \"Young Man Cash Man\" in 2013, \"Young Girl, Dream Girl\" in 2014, \"Satula\" in 2015, \"Bikineitä ja timantteja\" (or in English known as \"Bikinis and Diamonds\") in 2016 and \"Pihlajakadun tuhmat tädit\" in 2016–2017.\n\nOn 5 December 2012, the first \"Salatut elämät\" movie was released. The teen thriller movie \"Nightmare – Painajainen merellä\" (\"\"Nightmare – Nightmare at Sea\"\") was one of the most watched Finnish films of 2012. The film was directed by Marko Äijö and the main characters are Peppi (Sara Säkkinen), Heidi (Venla Savikuja), Jiri (Mikko Parikka), Joonatan (Markku Pulli), Miro (Patrik Borodavkin), Oona (Sara Lohiniva) and Sampo (Sampsa Tuomala). Nightmare - Painajainen merellä also won the Jussi Award in the category Public Favorite. A second film, called \"Nightmare 2\" was released in December 2014.\n\nThe show's gay storyline between Elias (Petteri Paavola) and Lari (Ronny Röslöf), nicknamed \"Larias\", initially proved very popular on YouTube. Scenes featuring their storyline were uploaded by a user called \"missfinlandia88\". As her account got terminated, she created a new one, \"Elias' Story\". She claims to have had the permission of MTV3 and FremantleMedia to post the clips. Elias was killed off in November 2016 but was seen in some dream scenes later on. The final parts, up to 459, can be seen on the \"Lauri K\" channel on YouTube.\n\nThe series has dealt with a wider range of subjects such as abortion, drug abuse, alcoholism, homosexuality, incest, animal rights, rape, religious fanaticism, gambling addiction, teenage pregnancy, domestic violence, cancer, eating disorder, school bullying, narcissistic personality disorder and its effects to the family, the search of biological parents, stealing and racism; many episodes involving these themes have caused public debate.\n\nAn exceptionally widespread controversy was started by the season finale aired on 1 June 2009. In the episode, a pregnant woman, Paula Sievinen (Johanna Nurmimaa), was seemingly buried alive and a café exploded during a wedding celebration, which implied death of many main characters. Many, including Finland's Minister of Communications Suvi Lindén, questioned the show's suitability for school children. FICORA (Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority) decided later that the episode was not suitable for children under the age of 11, but the show's programming slot was late enough to meet the regulations. In 2013, the original main character Jenni Vainio played by Anu Palevaara, was shot on front of the main house and it caused a lot of talk among the fans of the series. Jenni left the series after 14 years presence. However, producer Marko Äijö said that the biggest sensation of the series was in the early days, when Kalle Laitela, played by Pete Lattu, kissed another man. At that time, the channel MTV3 received over 40 meters of fax about the kiss.\n\nDuring the series' entire run in Finland, a 30-minute episode has aired every weekday in an early-evening slot at 7:30 pm. A new season usually premieres in either late August or early September and concludes by the beginning of June. Normally, the series is on a hiatus during the Christmas holidays, approximately 3 or 4 weeks. The series' episodes are also available online at the website http://katsomo.fi/ for 30 days after their original airing.\n\n\"Salatut elämät's\" main focus is the fictional street \"Pihlajakatu\", located in Ullanlinna, Helsinki. Other locations include a high school, a hospital, \"Café Moose\" and an inn, \"Amanda\", which contains the hotel, a restaurant and a gym \"Amadeus\". Former \"main café\" was \"Kentauri\" which, however, exploded during a wedding celebration in the season finale of the 11th season.\n\nAll of the houses and other locations featured in the show are filmed at the FremantleMedia studio in Konala, Helsinki. In real life, Pihlajakatu is Huvilakatu, which is located in Ullanlinna, Helsinki. \"Salatut elämä\"t has also filmed scenes in Tampere and in Lapland. A few episodes have also been filmed in the Canary Islands, Lithuania and London.\n\nThe original theme song was called \"Tunteisiin\" and performed by Anna Hanski but in 2001, the theme was changed to a version performed by Jore Marjaranta. In 2004, the theme song was replaced by an electronic version of the theme music. In 2014, the theme song was switched back to the original one, first heard on 1999. In 2019, the series got completely new theme song again.\n\nSince its first episode aired in January 1999, it has been one of the most popular TV shows in Finland, regularly attracting around a million viewers (1/5 of Finland's population). At the moment \"Salatut elämät\" is the highest-rated drama series in Finland, although its viewership has declined during the past few years.\n\n\n\n"}

He maintains a strong connection to his high school, where his baseball uniform number has been retired. He attended Marietta College in (Ohio) where he majored in sports medicine and played for legendary NCAA Division III coach Don Schaly.\n\nHe was a first team All-American his junior season when he was drafted in the first round by the San Francisco Giants. The school's baseball field sits on Mulholland Drive; it was renamed so in 1994 after Mulholland purchased a new lighting system for the field.\n\nTerry has one child with his ex-wife. He remarried on February 14, 2009.\n\nHe lists baseball card collecting as one of his hobbies.\n\nMulholland made his Major League debut on June 8, , with the San Francisco Giants. After that, he played for eleven different Major League teams: the Giants, the Phillies, the Yankees, the Mariners, the Cubs, the Braves, the Dodgers, the Pirates, the Indians, the Twins, and the Diamondbacks.\n\nHe is well known for having one of the \"nastiest\" pickoff moves in the game.\n\nWhile pitching for the Giants, Mulholland made a play that is often shown on sports bloopers shows. After he grabbed a hard-hit ground ball, the ball got stuck in the webbing of his glove. Mulholland then ran towards first base and tossed his glove to first baseman Bob Brenly, who recorded the out.\n\nOn June 18, , the Giants traded Mulholland, Dennis Cook and Charlie Hayes for former Cy Young Award winner Steve Bedrosian and a player to be named later. On August 15, , Mulholland no-hit the Giants 6-0 at Veterans Stadium. In pitching this, the first no-hitter in the stadium's history, Mulholland became the first pitcher to no-hit a former team since the Houston Colt .45s' Ken Johnson did so against the Cincinnati Reds in (Johnson lost the game 1-0—the only game, to date, whose losing pitcher had pitched a nine-inning no-hitter). He faced the minimum of 27 batters. The only batter to reach base was on a throwing error by Hayes on Rick Parker's ground ball leading off the seventh inning; Parker was retired on Dave Anderson's double play ground ball one batter later. The 27th out was made by Hayes with a lunging catch of Gary Carter's line drive down the 3rd base line. He defeated Don Robinson, who also served up the 500th career home run to Phillies legend, Mike Schmidt, just three years earlier.\n\nMulholland was named the starter for the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. \n\nMulholland started Game 6 for the Phillies in the 1993 World Series versus the Toronto Blue Jays. This game will always be remembered for Mitch Williams giving up the series-ending home run to Joe Carter. Mulholland was also the starting pitcher for the National League in the All-Star Game played at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nTerry was instrumental in the Cubs' playoff run, pitching in relief and as a starter, often on consecutive days.\n\nAt the 1999 trading deadline, the Braves acquired Mulholland along with infielder José Hernández from the Chicago Cubs for Micah Bowie, Rubén Quevedo and a player to be named later. He appeared in 16 games down the stretch with the Braves, going 4-2 with an ERA of 2.98, during a season that the Braves went to the World Series. The next season, Mulholland was used as a spot starter for the Braves, and went 9-9 with a 5.11 ERA in 156.7 innings of work. He became a free agent after the season ended.\n\nWhile pitching for the Minnesota Twins Mulholland became one of the few players who have beaten every Major League team.\n\nOn June 21, , the Diamondbacks waived Mulholland.\n\n\n"}

Governor and local resident Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor attended the opening ceremony on August 25, 1930. The bridge was renamed the \"Franklin D. Roosevelt Mid-Hudson Bridge\" in 1994 though the span is rarely referred to by its official name.\n\nThe bridge is long with a clearance of above the Hudson. At opening, it was the sixth-longest suspension bridge in the world. The chief engineer was Polish immigrant Ralph Modjeski, who had previously engineered the strengthening of the nearby Poughkeepsie Railroad bridge. Primary contractor was the American Bridge Company of Ambridge, Pennsylvania with steel from Carnegie. The span is unusual in that stiffening trusses were intentionally constructed on top of, not below, the deck.\n\nThe toll for passenger vehicles is $1.50 (cash) and $1.25 (E-ZPass) for eastbound traffic only.\n\nProposals for the Mid-Hudson span were made by state legislature in 1923. Although the Bear Mountain Bridge in Orange County, New York and the Holland Tunnel in Manhattan were under construction, there were then no fixed highway crossings south of Albany. Governor Alfred E. Smith signed the bill in June 1923. Construction would be undertaken by the New York State Department of Public Works (now the New York State Department of Transportation).\n\nConstruction began in 1925. Caissons weighing 66,000 tons were sunk into the riverbed; dirt was removed by crews working in a pressurized environment. The Gothic steel towers were constructed in April 1929. Three years after opening, ownership was transferred to the New York State Bridge Authority in 1933, shortly after the Authority was created.\n\nThe toll plaza was originally located on the eastern side of the bridge, but was moved to the western side in Ulster County when a new highway approach was opened in December 1967. Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York–New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to eastbound-only at that time.\n\nToday, the bridge carries three lanes of US 44 and NY 55 and a pedestrian/bicycle walkway over the Hudson. The bridge allows connections to US 9 on the east side, and US 9W to the west. The center lane is generally closed, except for rush hour traffic eastbound from 6am to 9am, and westbound from 3pm to 6pm. The center lane is also occasionally opened when work is being done on either side of the bridge. Five lane signals (referred to as \"gantries\" by NYSBA) indicate which lanes are open for travel. Approaches on either side of the bridge are four lanes, causing a bottleneck going onto the one- or two-lane span. The bridge has a computer-controlled LED decorative lighting system attached to the suspension cables, allowing the bridge to be decorated for Christmas (red, green) or the Fourth of July (red, white, and blue), and for other holidays.\n\nIn 2009, composer Joseph Bertolozzi completed Bridge Music, a project which allows listeners to hear the Mid-Hudson bridge played like a musical instrument. The work was created for New York's 400th anniversary observance of Henry Hudson's voyage up the Hudson. Originally intended to be a live performance piece, this \"audacious plan\" to compose music for a suspension bridge using the bridge itself as the instrument brought Bertolozzi wide international attention. A recording of the results, the 2009 CD \"Bridge Music\" (on the Delos label DE1045), entered the Billboard Classical Crossover Music Chart at #18, and has been released globally.\n\n\n"}

Usually this will be implemented through clauses in a company's articles of association, and will be designed to prevent stakebuilding above a certain percentage ownership level, or to give a government, or other shareholder, veto powers over any major corporate action, such as the sale of a major asset or subsidiary or of the company as a whole.\n\nIn the context of government-owned golden shares, this share is often retained only for some defined period of time to allow a newly privatised company to become accustomed to operating in a public environment, unless ownership of the organisation concerned is deemed to be of ongoing importance to national interests, for example for reasons of national security.\n\nNATS Holdings, the UK's main air navigation service provider, is an example of a company with a golden share.\n\nThe term arose in the 1980s when the British government retained golden shares in companies it privatised, an approach later taken in many other European countries, as well as the former Soviet Union. It was introduced in Russia by law on November 16, 1992.\n\nThe British government's golden share in BAA, the UK airports authority, was ruled illegal by European courts in 2003, when it was deemed contradictory to the principle of free circulation of capital within the European Union. The European Court of Justice also held that Portugal's holding of golden shares in Energias de Portugal is contrary to European Union law since it presented an unjustified restriction on free movement of capital.\n\nOther golden shares ruled illegal include the Spanish government's golden shares in Telefonica, Repsol YPF, Endesa, Argentaria and Tabacalera.\n\nThe golden share structure of Volkswagen AG and the travails of the German \"Land\" (federal state) of \"Niedersachsen\" (Lower Saxony) are discussed by Johannes Adolff as well by as Peer Zumbansen and Daniel Saam.\n\n"}

It is dedicated to the memory of Sergei Prokofiev. According to many, the last movement, \"Déploration,\" is the last piece Poulenc wrote before he died. It sits as a kind of obituary.\n\nThe Oboe Sonata is very difficult in places, especially the Scherzo. The sorrowful Déploration also requires great skill. To express his mourning for his friend Prokofiev, Poulenc uses the extremes of the oboe. For example, in one passage the player must play a phrase at the bottom of the oboe's range including B flat, the oboe's lowest note, very loudly (fortissimo). The same phrase is then repeated but is marked to be played very quietly (pianissimo). Another obvious example of Poulenc's use of extreme scoring in the first movement is the starting theme which is very high and the player must be skilled to control the notes and keep them in tune.\n\nThe piece is in three movements:\n\n\nThe movements are in the order slow-fast-slow as opposed to the fast-slow-fast of the traditional sonata.\n\nA typical performance will last between 13 and 15 minutes.\n\nThe sonata is the last of Poulenc's three sonatas for wind instruments and piano, the others being the Flute Sonata (1956) and the Clarinet Sonata (1962). Just after World War I he wrote a few other wind sonatas as well, for example a Sonata for two clarinets (FP 7a, 1918, revised 1945), a sonata for clarinet and bassoon (FP 32a. 1922, revised 1945), and a Sonata for horn, trumpet and trombone (FP 33a, 1922, revised 1945). \n\nPoulenc's wind sonatas share similar thematic material. For example, motifs in the final movement of the Clarinet Sonata can be heard in the Scherzo of the Oboe Sonata. Similarly, the Second Movement of the Clarinet Sonata opens with a motif that can be seen as an inversion of the opening of the Elégie of the Oboe Sonata.\n"}

A Mayo County surveyor drew up plans, which were approved by J. Price, a civil engineer. The official authorization was received from The Board of Trade in London and in 1883 an administrative body was organized to finance it ; total cost was projected to be approximately £5,000. The costs exceeded the estimates. However, John Grey Vesey Porter of County Fermanagh contributed his personal funds, so that the bridge could be built as designed. The bridge's structure consisted of a steel bowstring girder construction with a span of pivoting on a central pier. The roadway was in width. It was named for Michael Davitt, 19th Century Irish social campaigner, Fenian, and founder of the National Land League. Davitt officially opened the bridge in 1887.\n\nThe 1887 bridge was designed for horse-drawn traffic and deteriorated with the advent of heavier motorized traffic in the 1900s. In 1947 the Mayo County Council planned to demolish and replace the bridge. J & C McGloughlin of Dublin undertook the construction, which was the largest bridge construction project by an Irish company at the time. It was completed in early 1949.\n\nBy 2007 the bridge had a number of problems with its swing mechanism, which hindered boat traffic. A review of its structures indicated corrosion and the Mayo County Council gave its backing to provide a new swing bridge. Its new design by Malachy Walsh & Partners was based on a Spanish Calatrava architectural model. SIAC Construction undertook the work and it was opened in 2008. The finished bridge weighs 390 tons, but is still operated manually.\n\nIn November 2010, the bridge failed to close for over 2 hours, which resulted in a traffic snarl. The Mayo County Council ordered the bridge consultants and contractors to investigate this failure.

{"id": "1918886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918886", "title": "Low Pin Count", "text": "Low Pin Count\n\nThe Low Pin Count bus, or LPC bus, is a computer bus used on IBM-compatible personal computers to connect low-bandwidth devices to the CPU, such as the boot ROM, \"legacy\" I/O devices (integrated into a super I/O chip), and Trusted Platform Module (TPM). \"Legacy\" I/O devices usually include serial and parallel ports, PS/2 keyboard, PS/2 mouse, and floppy disk controller.\n\nMost PC motherboards with an LPC bus have either a Platform Controller Hub (PCH) or a southbridge chip, which acts as the host and controls the LPC bus. All other devices connected to the physical wires of the LPC bus are peripherals.\n\nThe LPC bus was introduced by Intel in 1998 as a software-compatible substitute for the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus. It resembles ISA to software, although physically it is quite different. The ISA bus has a 16-bit data bus and a 24-bit address bus that can be used for both 16-bit I/O port addresses and 24-bit memory addresses; both run at speeds up to 8.33 MHz. The LPC bus uses a heavily multiplexed four-bit-wide bus operating at four times the clock speed (33.3 MHz) to transfer addresses and data with similar performance.\n\nLPC's main advantage is that the basic bus requires only seven signals, greatly reducing the number of pins required on peripheral chips. An integrated circuit using LPC will need 30 to 72 fewer pins than its ISA equivalent. It is also easier to route on modern motherboards, which are often quite crowded. The clock rate was chosen to match that of PCI in order to further ease integration. Also, LPC is intended to be a motherboard-only bus. No connector is defined, and no LPC peripheral daughterboards are available, except Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) with a TPM daughterboard whose pinout is proprietary to the motherboard vendor and POST cards for displaying BIOS diagnostic codes. Device discovery is not supported; since only motherboard devices or specific models of TPM are connected, the host firmware (BIOS, UEFI) image will include a static description of any devices and their I/O addresses expected to be present on a particular motherboard.\n\nThe LPC specification defines seven mandatory signals required for bidirectional data transfer:\n\nThere are six additional signals defined, which are optional for LPC devices that do not require their functionality, but support for the first two is mandatory for the host:\n\nThe LPC bus derives its electrical conventions from those of conventional PCI. In particular, it shares the restriction that two idle cycles are required to \"turn around\" any bus signal so that a different device is \"speaking\". In the first, the bus is actively driven high. In the second, the bus is undriven and held high by the pull-up resistors. A new device may begin sending data over the bus on the third cycle. LPC operations spend a large fraction of their time performing such turn-arounds.\n\nAs mentioned, the LPC bus is designed to have performance similar to the ISA bus. The exact data transfer rates depend on the type of bus access (I/O, memory, DMA, firmware) performed and by the speed of the host and the LPC device. All bus cycles except the 128-byte firmware read cycle, in which 256 of the 273 clock ticks consumed by this cycle actually are used to transfer data to get a throughput of 15.63 MB/s, spend a majority of their time in overhead rather than data transfer. The next fastest bus cycle, the 32-bit ISA-style DMA write cycle that is defined in this standard, can transfer up to 6.67 MB/s because only 8 out of 20 clock ticks used in this bus cycle actually transfer data with the rest of the cycles are overhead.\n\nOne of the slowest bus cycles is a simple memory read or write, where only 2 of the 17 clock ticks (plus any wait states imposed by the device) transfer data, for a transfer rate of 1.96 MB/s.\n\nIntel designed the LPC bus so that the system BIOS image could be stored in a single flash memory chip directly connected to the LPC bus. Intel also made it possible to put operating system images and software applications on a single flash memory chip directly connected to the LPC bus, as an alternative to a Parallel ATA port.\n\nA CPLD or FPGA can implement an LPC host or peripheral.\n\nThe original Xbox game console has an LPC debug port that can be used to force the Xbox to boot new code.\n\nAll LPC bus transactions are initiated by the host briefly driving LFRAME# low, for one cycle at least. During the last cycle with LFRAME# low (referred to as the START field), the host drives LAD[3:0] to all-zeros to indicate an ISA-compatible transaction will follow. During the first cycle with LFRAME# high again, the host drives a \"cycle type/direction\" (CTDIR) field: three bits indicating the type (I/O, memory, or DMA) and direction (read from device, or write to device) of the transfer to follow. This is usually followed by the transfer address field. The size of the address depends on the type of cycle:\n\nMemory and I/O accesses are allowed as single-byte accesses only.\n\nFor a write, the address described above is followed by the data field, 8 bits transferred with the least significant nibble first over two cycles.\n\nFollowing this, the host turns the bus over to the device. This turn-around take two cycles, and operates the same way as the conventional PCI bus control signals: for one cycle, the host drives the LAD lines high (1111). During the second cycle, the host ceases to drive the lines, although they remain high due to the pull-up resistors. The device may drive the lines beginning with the third cycle.\n\nFollowing any turn-around to the device is a minimum of one SYNC cycle. The number is variable, under the control of the device to add as many wait states as it needs. The bit patterns 0101 and 0110 indicate that the sync cycles will continue. The wait ends when the device drives a pattern of 0000 (ready) or 1010 (error) on the LAD bus for one cycle.\n\nIn the case of reads, this is followed by 8 bits of data, transferred least significant nibble first over two cycles, the same as for a write.\n\nThe device then turns the bus around to the host again (taking another two cycles), and the transfer is complete; the host may send the START field of another transfer on the next cycle.\n\nIf the host attempts a transfer to an unused address, no device will drive the SYNC cycles and the host will see 1111 on the LAD bus. After seeing three cycles of 1111 (two cycles are allowed, in addition to the two turn-around cycles, for a slow device to decode the address and begin driving SYNC patterns), the host will abort the operation.\n\nThe Platform Controller Hub (PCH) chip or the southbridge chip acts as the host and controls the LPC bus. It also acts as the central DMA controller for devices on that bus if the memory controller is in the chipset. In CPUs that contain their own memory controller(s), the DMA controller is located in the CPU. For compatibility with software originally written for systems with the ISA bus, the DMA controller contains the circuit equivalents of \"legacy\" onboard peripherals of the IBM PC/AT architecture, such as the two programmable interrupt controllers, the programmable interval timer, and two ISA DMA controllers, which are all involved in \"ISA-style DMA\".\n\nISA-compatible DMA uses an Intel 8237-compatible DMA controller on the host, which keeps track of the location and length of the memory buffer, as well as the direction of the transfer. The device simply requests service from a given DMA channel number, and the host performs a DMA access on the LPC bus.\n\nDMA requests are made using the device's LDRQ# signal. Normally high, a device can indicate a transition on an ISA-compatible DRQ line by sending a 6-bit request: a 0 start bit, the 3-bit DMA channel number (most significant bit first), one bit of new request level (almost always 1, indicating that a DMA transfer is requested), and a final 1 stop bit. The host then performs a DMA cycle. DMA cycles are named based on the memory access, so a \"read\" is a transfer from memory to the device, and a \"write\" is a transfer from the device to memory.\n\nThe \"address\" consists of two cycles: a 3-bit channel number and 1-bit terminal count indication (the ISA bus's TC pin, or the 8237's EOP# output), followed by a 2-bit transfer size.\n\nBy default, DMA channels 0–3 perform 8-bit transfers, and channel 5–7 perform 16-bit transfers; but an LPC-specific extension allows 1-, 2-, or 4-byte transfers on any channel. When a multi-byte transfer is performed, each byte has its own SYNC field, as described below. DMA transfers allow an additional SYNC field value: a pattern of 1001 indicates that the device is ready with the current byte, and also wishes to transfer more bytes. The standard \"ready\" pattern of 0000 indicates that this is the last byte.\n\nA normal SYNC \"ready\" pattern of 0000 (or an error pattern of 1010) requests that the host stop DMA after the immediately following byte until the device makes another DMA request via the LDRQ# signal. A pattern of 1001 indicates that the host should consider he device's DMA request still active; the host will continue with any remaining bytes in this transfer or start another transfer, as appropriate, without a separate request via LDRQ#.\n\nFor a DMA write, where data is transferred from the device, the SYNC field is followed by the 8 bits of data and another SYNC field, until the host-specified length for this transfer is reached, or the device stops the transfer. A two-cycle turnaround field completes the transaction. For a DMA read, where data is transferred to the device, the SYNC field is followed by a turnaround, and the data—turnaround—sync—turnaround sequence repeats for each byte transferred.\n\nSerialized interrupts are transmitted over a single shared SERIRQ line with the help of the clock. A time slot is dedicated to each interrupt request, with the initial synchronization being done by the host. As a simplified example:\n\nThe devices can synchronize at the first step because the line can only be driven low for two or more consecutive clocks by the host: no other device drives it low for more than one clock. The host recognizes the sources of the interrupts by watching the line while counting the number of clocks: if it sees the SERIRQ line being driven low at the eighteenth clock, then IRQ 18/3=6 is asserted.\n\nThe above is the continuous mode, where the host initiates the protocol. In the quiet mode, a device requests interruption by driving SERIRQ low for a clock. The host then continues driving the line low for the other seven clocks. From this point on, the protocol is the same. In both modes, the number of clocks of the initial synchronization pulse may range from four to eight.\n\nAt the beginning, the protocol works in continuous mode. At the end of each complete bus transaction (after the host has driven SERIRQ low and then waited for all devices to send interrupt requests) the host sends a final message: it drives the SERIRQ line low for two or three clocks depending on the mode that will be used in the next transaction.\n\nThe advantage of using serialized interrupts over the traditional mechanism is that only the single SERIRQ line is necessary (apart from the clock, which is present anyway), not a line for each interrupt level.\n\nSTART field values other than 0000 are used to indicate various non-ISA-compatible transfers. The supported transfers are:\n\n\nThe LPC bus specification limits what type of peripherals may be connected to it. It only allows devices that belong to the following classes of devices: super I/O devices, integrated audio including either AC'97 devices or devices that implemented the Sound Blaster interface, generic-application memory including nonvolatile BIOS memory, firmware hubs, and embedded controllers. Furthermore, each class is restricted on which bus cycles are allowed for each class.\n\nSuper I/O devices and audio devices are allowed to accept I/O cycles, accept ISA-style third-party DMA cycles, and generate bus master cycles. Generic-application memory devices like nonvolatile BIOS memory and LPC flash devices are allowed to accept memory cycles. Firmware hubs are allowed to accept firmware memory cycles. Embedded controllers are allowed to accept I/O cycles and generate bus master cycles. Some ISA cycles that were deemed not useful to these classes were removed. They include host-initiated two-byte memory cycles and host-initiated two-byte I/O cycles. These removed transfer types could be initiated by the host on ISA buses but not on LPC buses. The host would have to simulate two-byte cycles by splitting them up into two one-byte cycles. The ISA bus has a similar concept because the original 8-bit ISA bus required 16-bit cycles to be split up. Therefore, the 16-bit ISA bus automatically split 16-bit cycles into 8-bit cycles for the benefit of 8-bit ISA peripherals unless the ISA device being targeted by a 16-bit memory or I/O cycle asserted a signal that told the bus that it could accept the requested 16-bit transfer without assistance from an ISA cycle splitter. ISA-style bus mastering has been replaced in the LPC bus with a bus mastering protocol that does not rely on the ISA-style DMA controllers at all. This was done in order to remove ISA's limit on what type of bus master cycles a device is allowed to initiate on which DMA channel. The ISA-style bus cycles that were inherited by LPC from ISA are one-byte host-initiated I/O bus cycles, one-byte host-initiated memory cycles, and one- or two-byte host-initiated ISA-style DMA cycles.\n\nHowever, some non-ISA bus cycles were added. Cycles that were added to improve the performance of devices beside firmware hubs include LPC-style one-, two-, and four-byte bus master memory cycles; one-, two-, and four-byte bus master I/O cycles; and 32-bit third-party DMA which conforms to all of the restrictions of ISA-style third-party DMA except for the fact that it can do 32-bit transfers. Any device that is allowed to accept traditional ISA-style DMA is also allowed to use this 32-bit ISA-style DMA. The host could initiate 32-bit ISA-style DMA cycles, while peripherals could initiate bus master cycles. Firmware hubs consumed firmware cycles that were designed just for firmware hubs so that firmware addresses and normal memory-mapped I/O addresses could overlap without conflict. Firmware memory reads could read 1, 2, 4, 16, or 128 bytes at once. Firmware memory writes could write one, two or four bytes at once.\n\n\n"}

She was a younger sister of Lady Frances Brandon and an elder sister of Henry Brandon, 1st Earl of Lincoln. She was also a younger paternal half-sister of Lady Anne Brandon and Lady Mary Brandon from her father's second marriage. After her mother's death in 1533, her father remarried to Catherine Willoughby and Eleanor became an elder half-sister of Henry Brandon, 2nd Duke of Suffolk and Charles Brandon, 3rd Duke of Suffolk.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Sir William Brandon and Elizabeth Bruyn. Her maternal grandparents were Henry VII of England and his queen consort Elizabeth of York. She was thus a niece of Henry VIII.\n\nLady Eleanor was a descendant of a member of the Tudor dynasty and therefore her marriage would advance the political ambitions of any given husband. In March 1533, a marriage contract was written up for Lady Eleanor and Henry Clifford, the eldest son and heir of Henry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland by Lady Margaret Percy. However, since her mother died nine months later, she waited to go and live with her young husband and in-laws. In anticipation of Eleanor's arrival, the Earl of Cumberland built two towers and the great gallery within Skipton Castle. Eleanor married Clifford in June 1535; her uncle King Henry VIII was present.\n\nIn January 1536, Eleanor was designated the chief mourner for the funeral service of Catherine of Aragon, first Queen consort of Henry VIII, at Peterborough Cathedral.\n\nThere is not much known about her later life and she left only one letter:\n\nThe Will of Henry VIII, excluding the argument that it was signed with a dry stamp rather than by hand, defined that Eleanor was in line to succeed her maternal uncle Henry VIII. She was eighth-in-line for the throne following:\n\n\nHenry VIII died on 28 January 1547. Prince Edward became King Edward VI. Lady Eleanor was the seventh-in-line for the throne, but she died on 27 September the same year without surviving male issue at Brougham Castle, and was buried at Skipwith. Her place in line was taken by her daughter. Her husband later remarried Anne Dacre, who bore him six more children.\n\nWith Henry Clifford:\n\nThere is a discrepancy as to who the sitter is in the Hans Eworth portrait which is featured. The coat of arms in the top left corner, which may have been added later, are the impaled arms (those of a husband and wife) of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, and his wife Lady Eleanor, daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France. As a result, the painting has been frequently exhibited in the past as a portrait of Lady Eleanor, regardless of the fact that she died in 1547, well before the date of this portrait. It is, however, a rule of heraldry that impaled arms are not used by the children of a marriage, as they would have their own. Hence the later addition and erroneous use of the arms here suggests that the identity of the portrait was already unclear only two or three generations after it was painted, a situation by no means unusual amid the frequent early deaths, multiple marriages, and shifting alliances and fortunes of the most powerful families of the Tudor era. Later the portrait was thought to represent the only child of Eleanor and Henry to survive infancy, Margaret. Unfortunately the inscription on the right which might have provided a check (Margaret would have been aged 25–28 at the time of this portrait) has been truncated; although the Roman numerals of the year can apply only to 1565-8, the age of the sitter cannot be ascertained with any useful accuracy. The National Portrait Gallery has an online sketch of this portrait identified as Lady Eleanor, but the portrait remains in dispute. There is, however, a portrait of Lady Eleanor featured at Skipton Castle. It is reportedly a very poor work of art, but nonetheless interesting.\n\n"}

Contraction of these muscles causes the hairs to stand on end, known colloquially as goose bumps.\n\nEach arrector pili is composed of a bundle of smooth muscle fibres which attach to several follicles (a follicular unit), and is innervated by the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. The contraction of the muscle is then involuntary–stresses such as cold, fear etc. may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, and thus cause contraction.\n\nContraction of the muscles has a number of different purposes. Its principal function in the majority of mammals is to provide insulation: air becomes trapped between the erect hairs, helping the animal retain heat. Erection of the porcupine's long, thick hairs causes the animal to become more intimidating, scaring predators. Pressure exerted by the muscle may cause sebum to be forced along the hair follicle towards the surface, protecting the hair.\n\n"}
{"id": "1918902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918902", "title": "Burgher people", "text": "Burgher people\n\nBurgher people, also known simply as Burghers, are a small Eurasian ethnic group in Sri Lanka descended from Portuguese, Dutch, British and other European men who settled in Sri Lanka and developed relationships with native Sri Lankan women. The Portuguese and Dutch had held some of the maritime provinces of the island for centuries before the advent of the British Empire. With the establishment of Ceylon as a crown colony at the end of the 18th century, most of those who retained close ties with the Netherlands departed. However, a significant community of Burghers remained and largely adopted the English language. During British rule they occupied a highly important place in Sri Lankan social and economic life.\n\nPortuguese settlers on Ceylon were essentially traders, but wished to form colonies, and Lisbon did nothing to discourage European settlement—even to the extent of advocating intermarriage with the Sinhalese. This was not encouraged by the Sinhalese. It was not the policy of the Dutch East India Company to endorse similar unions, although a number of unofficial liaisons between its employees and local women occurred in the late eighteenth century.\n\nBurghers may vary from generation to generation in physical characteristics; some intermarried with the British and produced descendants with predominantly European phenotypes, including fairer skin and a heavier physique, while others were almost indistinguishable from Sinhalese or Tamils. Most Burgher people have preserved European customs; especially among those of Portuguese ancestry, who \"retained their European religion and language with pride.\"\n\nThe Burghers were legally defined in 1883 by the Chief Justice of Ceylon, Sir Richard Ottley, given before the Commission, appointed in connection with the establishment of a legislative council in Ceylon. Burghers were defined as those whose father was born in Sri Lanka, with at least one European ancestor on one's direct paternal side, regardless of the ethnic origin of one's mother, or what other ethnic groups may be found on the father's side. Because of this definition, Burghers almost always have European surnames (mostly of Portuguese, Dutch and British origin, but sometimes German, French or Russian).\n\nThe Portuguese arrived in 1505 in what outsiders then called Ceylon. Since there were no women in the Portuguese navy, the Portuguese sailors married local Sinhalese and Tamil women. This practice was encouraged by the Portuguese.\n\nThe Dutch first made contact and signed a trade agreement with the Kingdom of Kandy in 1602. From 1640 on the Dutch East India Company (VOC) had a governor installed and conquered more and more fords from the Portuguese, until, in 1658, the last Portuguese were expelled. However, they permitted a few stateless persons of Portuguese-Jewish (Marrano) descent, and of mixed Portuguese-Sinhalese ancestry to stay. Many people having a Portuguese name were a result of forced conversions of local/native people in order to work for the Portuguese. As a result, Burghers with Portuguese names are most likely to be of Sinhalese ancestry, with a very small portion being Portuguese or mixed Portuguese-Sinhalese ancestry. Those of a Portuguese-Jewish background can be traced in various forms or surmised from their surname. Most Burghers of Eurasian descent with Portuguese surnames are of Sinhalese and Dutch, British, German and/or other European descent.\n\nDuring the Dutch period, all Dutch colonial operations were overseen by the VOC ('Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie' or \"United East India Company\"). Virtually all Burghers from this period were employees of the VOC. The VOC employed not only Dutch nationals, but also enlisted men from the Southern Netherlands, the German states, Denmark and Austria. It is therefore not unusual to find ancestors from these countries in many Dutch Burgher family trees.\n\nThe term 'Burgher' comes from the Dutch word \"burger\", meaning \"citizen\" or \"town dweller\", and is cognate with the French and English word \"bourgeois\". At this time in Europe, there had emerged a middle class, consisting of people who were neither aristocrats nor serfs. These were the traders and businessmen, who lived in towns and were considered free citizens. In Europe, they were called burghers, and they were encouraged to migrate to the colonies in order to expand business horizons.\n\nDutch Ceylon had two classes of people of European descent: those who were paid by the VOC and were referred to as Company servants (i.e. employees), and those who had migrated of their own free will. The latter were not referred to as burghers in Ceylon, but rather by their rank, position or standing.\n\nDuring British colonial rule, they were referred to by the British as 'Dutch Burghers' and formed the European-descended civilian population in Ceylon. To some degree the term of Burgher was used in a derogatory way to divide and conquer the population, as it distinguished between British and other races or positions. The 'Dutch Burgher' community took pride in its own achievements and prized their European ancestry. A number of Dutch Burgher Union journals have been created over a period of time, to record family histories. They were not only of Dutch origin but incorporated European (Dutch, German, Hungarian, Italian, French, Swedish etc.), United Kingdom, Portuguese Mix, and Sinhalese lines.\n\nWhen the British took over in 1796, many VOC employees chose to leave. However, a significant number chose to stay, mostly those of mixed descent. Some chose to go to Batavia, which was the headquarters of the VOC. Reportedly about 900 families, both free citizens and United East India Company employees, decided to remain in Ceylon. The British referred to them all as 'Dutch Burghers'. One condition of their being allowed to stay was that they had to sign a Treaty of Capitulation to the British. Many 'Dutch Burghers' can find their ancestors' names in this treaty. At the time of the British conquest, the 900 'Dutch Burgher' families residing in Ceylon were concentrated in Colombo, Galle, Matara and Jaffna.\n\nThe Burghers included members of the Swiss de Meuron Regiment, a mercenary unit employed by the VOC. In diplomatic negotiations in Europe, Count de Meuron pledged allegiance to the British in exchange for back pay and information. This allowed the British to get detailed fortification information and reduce the fighting strength of Ceylon prior to 1796. The de Meuron Regiment refused to fight the Dutch due to relationships forged on the island of Ceylon and South Africa. Post 1796 members of the de Meuron Regiment stayed in Ceylon, whilst the regiment itself went off to fight and distinguish itself in India and later in Canada.\n\nIn the census of 1981, the Burgher population of Sri Lanka was 39,374 persons, about 0.2% of the total population. The highest concentration of Burghers is in Colombo (0.72%) and Gampaha (0.5%). There are also significant communities in Trincomalee and Batticaloa, with an estimated population of 20,000.\n\nBurgher descendants are spread throughout the world. Families with surnames such as Van Dort (or the variant Vandort) are of Dutch ancestry.\n\nNowadays Burgher people predominantly speak Sinhala. Until the early 20th century, many Burghers spoke English and a form of Portuguese Creole, even those of Dutch descent. Portuguese Creole had been the language of trade and communication with Sri Lankans. It is now only spoken in parts of the coastal towns of Trincomalee and Batticaloa. While much vocabulary is from Portuguese, its grammar is based on that of Tamil and Sinhala.\n\nDepending on where they live in Sri Lanka, Burghers may also additionally speak English and or Tamil. According to the 2012 Census 73.6% or 24,412 Burghers also spoke English and 88.3% or 29,277 Burghers also spoke Tamil.\n\nBurgher culture is a mixture of East and West, reflecting their ancestry. They are the most Europeanised of the ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. Most of them wear modern contemporary clothing, although it is not uncommon for a man to be seen wearing a \"sarong\", or for a woman to wear a \"sari\".\n\nA number of elements in Burgher culture have become part of the cultures of other ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. For example, \"baila\" music, which has its origin in the music of 16th-century Portugal, has found its way into mainstream popular Sinhalese music. Lacemaking, which began as a domestic pastime of Burgher women, is now a part of Sinhalese culture too. Even certain foods, such as love cake, breudher, \"bol fiado\" (layered cake), \"ijzer koekjes\" (iron cookies), \"frikkadels\" (savoury meatballs) and lamprais, have become an integral part of Sri Lankan national cuisine.\n\nBurghers are not physically homogeneous. It is possible to have a blond, pale white-skinned Burgher, as well as a Burgher with a very dark complexion and black hair, a Burgher with complexion from brown to light brown and black hair, and a Burgher with fairer complexion and black hair. Pale-skinned and dark-skinned children can even appear as brother and sister in the same family of the same parents. Burghers share a common culture rather than a common ethnicity.\n\nBurghers have a very strong interest in their family histories. Many old Burgher families kept \"stamboeken\" (from the Dutch for \"clan books\"). These recorded not only dates of births, marriages and deaths, but also significant events in the history of a family, such as details of moving house, illnesses, school records, and even major family disputes. An extensive, multi-volume \"stamboek\" of many family lineages is kept by the Dutch Burgher Union.\n\nIndividual families often have indigenous European traditions reflecting their specific family origins. Burghers of Dutch origin sometimes celebrate the Feast of Saint Nicholas in December, and those of Portuguese-Jewish origin observe customs such as the separation time of a woman after childbirth (see Leviticus 12:2-5), the redemption of the Firstborn (\"Pidyon ha-Ben\"), and the purification bath (\"taharah\") after a daughter’s first period (see \"niddah\"). Most of the latter Burgher families, being unaware of the Jewish origins of these customs, have given them a Catholic slant. (Catholic and Episcopal churches had services for the churching of women after childbirth from ancient times.)\n\nHowever, some traditions attributed to Judaism can also be explained as borrowings or retention from the Tamil and Sinhalese communities with whom many Burgher families also share ancestry and culture. For example, the purification bath after a girl’s first period is a common cultural feature of the Tamil and Sinhalese communities of Sri Lanka and neighboring India. Hence its prevalence amongst some Burghers families of Sri Lanka is not necessarily of Jewish origins.\n\nSome commentators believe that the Burghers’ own mixed backgrounds have made their culture more tolerant and open. While inter-communal strife has been a feature of modern Sri Lankan life, some Burghers have worked to maintain good relations with other ethnic groups.\n\nIn 2001 the Burghers established a heritage association, the Burgher Association, with headquarters at No.393, Union Place, Colombo 2 Sri Lanka.\n\n\n"}

This subset of forced migration has been historically associated with the construction of dams for hydroelectric power and irrigation but is also the result of various development projects such as mining, agriculture, the creation of military installations, airports, industrial plants, weapon testing grounds, railways, road developments, urbanization, conservation projects, and forestry.\n\nDevelopment-induced displacement is a social problem affecting multiple levels of human organization, from tribal and village communities to well-developed urban areas. Development is widely viewed as an inevitable step towards modernization and economic growth in developing countries; however, for those who are displaced, the end result is most often loss of livelihood and impoverishment.\n\nClassification of development-induced displaced persons (DIDPs), refugees and internally displaced persons rests on fundamental differences in the type of assistance provided to each category. Refugees and internally displaced persons typically need international protection and assistance as a result of fleeing violence and persecution. Development-induced displaced persons require the restoration of their capacity to generate income and protection from the state. While people displaced as a result of development have similar experiences to refugees (as defined by the UNHCR) in terms of economic and social loss, they are not protected by international law.\n\n\"Primary\" or \"direct\" displacement occurs when people are moved from their traditional lands to make way for a development project or when people move towards a project to meet a new labor demand. Primary displacement is usually predictable and can therefore be mitigated through planning.\n\n\"Secondary\" or \"indirect\" displacement is a result of environmental, geographical and socio-political consequences of the development project that take place over time and distance from the initial project. This type of displacement is less predictable and difficult to control. One example of secondary displacement is if a community is forced to move because of pollution of their water supply by a mining project.\n\nSome examples of development-induced displacement are:\n\nIt has been estimated that fifteen million people each year are forced to leave their homes as a result of public and private development projects and that number continues to increase as countries move from developing to developed nations.\n\nCompensation and rehabilitation policies designed to mitigate effects of displacement are often unsuccessful. This is largely due to corruption of street level bureaucrats, underestimation of the value of resources, failure of planners to recognize the intricacies of the existing social and economic systems of the displaced and lack of involvement of displaced persons in the planning process. Communities and individuals are most often only compensated monetarily, without proper mechanisms for addressing their grievances or political support to improve their livelihoods. When land is used as compensation, it is often inadequate in terms of size, location and natural resources. Land tenure laws may also prevent resettlement policy from being effective. Poor and indigenous people are mostly affected by displacement as they have few political and monetary resources.\n\nMichael Cernea's impoverishment and reconstruction model (IRR) sets forth eight potential risks of displacement:\nThe consensus among researchers is that impoverishment due to loss of capacity to generate income is the most apparent effect of DIDR. Additionally, displacement severs social ties which are often crucial for survival in indigenous communities. Loss of connection to historical, religious, symbolic or spatial locations resulting from forced migration diminishes cultural identity. Development-induced displaced persons, like refugees and internally displaced persons, experience psychological stress as well as feelings of helplessness and distrust towards their government and humanitarian groups. While the state is charged with protecting them as equal citizens, they are considered \"others\" and left to bear the cost for those who will benefit.\n\nWomen are disproportionately affected by DIDR as the loss of land used by women to generate economic worth further marginalizes their socio-economic standing as they become more dependent on their husbands.\n\nThe work of sociologists and anthropologists studying displaced populations gradually led to a body of theoretical and conceptual knowledge. Development planners were eventually forced to rely on the work of social scientists in order to devise resettlement plans. Cernea explains that, assisted by dissent from NGOs and displaced persons themselves, a \"ripple effect\" of early policies led to expansion of resettlement policy which continues to broaden over time.\n\nResettlement policy may be adopted by the state, regional associations, private development companies, NGOs, large financial institutions and the United Nations. Regardless of the source of the policy, local-level participation during all stages of the planning process is crucial to mitigating negative outcomes. Policies adopted by large financial institutions (mainly the World Bank and OECD), NGOs (The Brookings Institution) and the World Commission on Dams provide guidelines for resettlement of those displaced by development. Implementation of these policies is often lacking and, with no political mandate, the guidelines are usually ineffective. State involvement is dependent on political will but the precarious position of the state as \"player and referee\" leaves the displaced with little protection.\n\nIn 1998, the United Nations was presented with the \"Guiding Principals on Internal Displacement\", a set of guidelines proposed by group of legal scholars identifying rights and protections for internally displaced people. These guidelines specifically name the state as the protector of the rights of its citizens against the effects of development-induced displacement. Should the state fail to protect the rights of DIDRs, the \"Guidelines\" state that the international community must respond. In 2002, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established an IDP Unit to investigate instances of DIDR. There is currently no enforceable international law governing DIDR.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1918906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1918906", "title": "Acousmatic music", "text": "Acousmatic music\n\nAcousmatic music (from Greek ἄκουσμα \"akousma\", \"a thing heard\") is a form of electroacoustic music that is specifically \"composed\" for presentation using speakers, as opposed to a live performance. It stems from a compositional tradition that dates back to the introduction of musique concrète (a form of musique expérimentale) in the late 1940s. Unlike musical works that are realised using sheet music exclusively, compositions that are purely acousmatic (in listening terms) often exist solely as fixed media audio recordings.\n\nThe compositional practice of acousmatic music features acousmatic sound as a central musical aspect. Other aspects traditionally thought of as 'musical' such as melody, harmony, rhythm, metre may be present but more often consideration is given to sound-based characteristics such as timbre and spectrum. Compositional materials can include sounds derived from musical instruments, voice, electronically generated sound, audio that has been manipulated using various effect processors, as well as general sound effects and field recordings.\n\nThe music is produced with the aid of various music technologies, such as digital recorders, digital signal processing tools and digital audio workstations. Using such technology various sound materials can be combined, juxtaposed, and transformed in any conceivable manner. In this context the compositional method can be seen as a process of \"sound organisation\": a term first used by the French composer Edgard Varèse.\n\nAccording to certain historical accounts, the origin of the term \"acousmatic\" can be traced back to Pythagoras; the philosopher is believed to have tutored his students from behind a screen so as not to let his presence distract them from the content of his lectures. Under these conditions, the listener focuses on the sounds being produced to heighten the sense of hearing. In 1955, Jérôme Peignot and Pierre Schaeffer were the first to use the term \"acousmatique\" to define the listening experience of musique concrète. It is said to be derived from \"akousmatikoi\", the outer circle of Pythagoras' disciples who only heard their teacher speaking from behind a veil. In a similar way, one hears acousmatic music from behind the 'veil' of loudspeakers, without seeing the source of the sound.\n\nWithin academia the term acousmatic music, or acousmatic art, has gained common usage, particularly when referring to contemporary musique concrète; however, there is some dispute as to whether acousmatic practice relates to a style of composition or a way of listening to sound. Scruton defines the experience of sound as inherently acousmatic, as Lydia Goehr (1999) paraphrases, \"the sound world is not a space into which we can enter; it is a world we treat at a distance\".\n\nAcousmatic music may contain sounds that have recognizably musical sources, but may equally present recognizable sources that are beyond the bounds of traditional vocal and instrumental technology. We are as likely to hear the sounds of a bird, or of a factory as we are the sounds of a violin. The technology involved transcends the mere reproduction of sounds. Techniques of synthesis and sound processing are employed which may present us with sounds that are unfamiliar and that may defy clear source attribution. Acousmatic compositions may present us with familiar musical events: chords, melodies and rhythms which are easily reconcilable with other forms of music, but may equally present us with events which cannot be classified within such a traditional taxonomy.\n\nAcousmatic compositions are sometimes presented to audiences in concert settings that are often indistinguishable from acoustic recitals, albeit without performers. In an acousmatic concert the sound component is produced using pre-recorded media, or generated in real-time using a computer. The sound material will then be distributed spatially, via multiple loudspeakers, using a practice known as \"sound diffusion\". The work is often \"diffused\" by the composer (if present) but the role of interpreter can also be assumed by another practitioner of the art. To provide a guideline for \"spatialisation\" of the work by an interpreter, many composers provide a \"diffusion score\"; in its simplest form this might be a graphic representation of the acousmatic work with indications for spatial manipulations, relative to a time-line.\n\nIn acousmatic music, listeners are challenged to distinguish sounds, not based on their source, but by their sonic quality. As Pierre Schaeffer writes in his \"Treatise on Musical Objects\" \"The concealment of the causes does not result from a technical imperfection, nor is it an occasional process of variation: it becomes a precondition, a deliberate placing-in-condition of the subject. It is \"toward it\", then, that the question turns around; \"what am I hearing?... What exactly are you hearing\" -in the sense that one asks the subject to describe not the external references of the sound it perceives but the perception itself.\" \n\nThat music is acousmatic is determined more by \"how\" it is listened to, than by whether it is being played from a loudspeaker or not. In understanding the term 'acousmatic' appropriately, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between sound source and sound identity.\n\nIf for example a recording of a solo cello being played in a recognizable way is sounded through a loudspeaker, the source of the sound is the loudspeaker, but its identity is still 'cello' for a listener. Thus, acousmatic music can be said to be that which calls for the listener to perceive sound without (or with a reduced) sensibility to the sound's identity. The listening mode is oriented instead upon more abstract timbral than mimetic aspects of the sound. Pierre Schaeffer has referred to this as \"écoute réduite\". It can be said that an \"écoute réduite\" leads to the perception of music as acousmatic, in the sense that playing sounds from loudspeakers has the potential for obscuring their identity, as the visual reference is removed.\n\n\n"}

He joined the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM) in 1959 for a two-year master class, shortly after its founding by Pierre Schaeffer. After leaving his studies with Lecoq, he was first a sound engineer and was later put in charge of the Music/Image unit for French television (ORTF). There he worked in the studio with several notable composers, Iannis Xenakis, for example.\n\nWhile at ORTF Parmegiani produced music for numerous film directors including Jacques Baratier and Peter Kassovitz, and for \"A\", a 1965 short film animated by Jan Lenica. He also wrote a number of jingles for the French media and the \"Indicatif Roissy\" that preceded every PA announcement at Terminal 1 of Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris until 2005.\n\nParmegiani composed his first major work, \"Violostries\", for violin and tape in 1964 for a choreography performed for Théâtre Contemporain d'Amiens directed by Jacques-Albert Cartier. During a visit to America in the late 1960s, Parmegiani researched the link between music and video and on his return produced several musical videos, including \"L'Œil écoute\", and \"L'Écran transparent\" (1973) during a residency at Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Germany. In the 1970s, he also became involved with live performances of jazz and performed with the Third Ear Band in London.\n\nAt this time Parmegiani also started writing acousmatic pieces for performance in the concert hall: examples are \"Capture éphémère\" of 1967 which deals with the passage of time, and \"L'Enfer\" (1972), a collaboration with the composer François Bayle, based on Dante's \"Divine Comedy\".\n\nParmegiani composed the music for Walerian Borowczyk's films \"Jeux des Anges\" (1964) and \"Docteur Jekyll et les femmes\" (1981), the soundtrack for the latter comprising cues Parmegiani re-arranged from his 1972 work \"Pour en finir avec le pouvoir d'Orphée\".\n\nIn 1992 Parmegiani left the GRM and set up his own studio in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. In April 2010 he sat on the jury at the sixth Qwartz Electronic Music Awards, a promotional project and support group for electronic music artists.\n\nParmegiani has been cited as a major influence by younger experimentalists like Aphex Twin, Autechre and Sonic Youth. Works of his were performed at the All Tomorrow's Parties festivals in 2003 and 2008.\n\nHis music has won awards, among them prizes from the Académie du Disque Français in 1979, SACEM in 1981, Les Victoires de la Musique in 1990, and the Prix Magister at the Concours International de Bourges in 1991. In 1993 he was awarded the Golden Nica Award at Prix Ars Electronica for \"Entre-temps\" composed the previous year..d\n\n\n"}

It is one of two species of lizard of the genus \"Iguana\" and is in severe decline due to habitat destruction, introduced feral predators, hunting, and hybridization with its introduced sister species, the green iguana (\"Iguana iguana\"). Successful captive breeding of this species has been limited to only two instances, as most captive-laid eggs tend to be infertile.\n\nOther common names for it are Lesser Antillean green iguana or West Indian iguana.\n\nThe generic name \"iguana\" is derived from \"iwana\", a Spanish form of the Taino name for the species. Its specific name \"delicatissima\" is Latin for \"delicate\". The species was first officially described by Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768.\n\nThe Lesser Antilles iguana has a more blocky, shortened face than the green iguana and lacks the distinctive stripe pattern present along the green iguana's tail. The feature that most easily distinguishes these two species is the large, round scale that the green iguana has below each ear hole but which the Lesser Antillean iguana lacks.\n\nThe Lesser Antillean iguana varies in color between different island populations, but the base color tends to be gray, with green splotching on the underside. They have large pale, ivory colored scales on their heads. The jowls of males are pink and the scales around the eyes are blue. Males also have femoral pores along each inner thigh that exude pheromones during breeding season. Males are larger than females and are long, with an tail when full-grown. Females are two-thirds this size.\n\nThe Lesser Antillean iguana is found in scrub woodlands, rainforests, and mangroves throughout the Lesser Antilles on Saint Barth, Anguilla, St. Eustatius, Guadeloupe, Dominica, and Martinique.\n\nLesser Antillean iguanas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, flowers, fruit, and growing shoots of upwards of 100 different species of plant.\n\nThe Lesser Antillean iguana is a critically endangered species and is found on the IUCN Red List. The Lesser Antillean iguana is legally protected from hunting throughout its range, but enforcement of these regulations is extremely difficult and therefore limited. Other threats include habitat loss to agriculture and development and the introduction of feral predators such as dogs, cats, and mongooses.\n\nThe species' greatest threat is from its own relative. The green iguana has been introduced to the Lesser Antilles as an invasive species and directly competes with the Lesser Antillean iguana for food and resources. In addition, the green iguana has been interbreeding with the Lesser Antillean iguana and this hybridization has been the number one reason for the latter species' decline on at least three of the islands: Les Iles des Saintes, Basse Terre (Guadeloupe) and St. Barthélemy. After a group of green iguanas washed ashore after hurricane Luis in 1995 on the island of Saint Martin, the endemic Lesser Antillean iguana population was gone within twenty years.\nCaptive Lesser Antillean iguanas are currently kept at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Chester Zoo, the Memphis Zoo, and the San Diego Zoo's Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species. All individuals originate from the Commonwealth of Dominica. Breeding and keeping the species in captivity is difficult. Mating and egg laying have occurred at each institution, but most of the eggs have been infertile; however, a single individual was successfully hatched at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in 1997 and in 2000 eight iguanas were hatched. Following on from this success, 11 iguanas hatched at Durrell in 2016 and they will be sent to zoos across Europe in an effort to promote and support the urgent conservation work for this species. In 2018 four captured iguanas from Sint Eustatius were sent to Blijdorp zoo in Rotterdam, The Netherlands for a breeding programme.\n\n"}

Historically it was a lower-cost alternative to a fabric topology. It allowed connection of many servers and computer storage devices without using then very costly Fibre Channel switches. The cost of the switches dropped considerably, so by 2007, FC-AL had become rare in server-to-storage communication. It is however still common within storage systems.\n\n\nArbitrated loop can be physically cabled in a ring fashion or using a hub. The physical ring ceases to work if one of the devices in the chain fails. The hub on the other hand, while maintaining a logical ring, allows a star topology on the cable level. Each \"receive\" port on the hub is simply passed to next active \"transmit\" port, bypassing any inactive or failed ports.\n\nFibre Channel hubs therefore have another function: They provide bypass circuits that\nprevent the loop from breaking if one device fails or is removed. If a device is removed\nfrom a loop (for example, by pulling its interconnect plug), the hub’s bypass circuit\ndetects the absence of signal and immediately begins to route incoming data directly\nto the loop’s next port, bypassing the missing device entirely. This gives loops at least\na measure of resiliency—failure of one device in a loop doesn’t cause the entire loop\nto become inoperable.\n\n"}

The unified New York Fever team competed in one season in the A-League in 1996 before folding.\n\nThe Fever originally played out of Barrett Stadium on the campus of Westchester Community College in Valhalla, New York.\n\nThe Centaurs played their games at Downing Stadium on Randall's Island, the former home of the New York Cosmos.\n\nThe saga of the New York Centaurs/Fever began in 1994 when English businessman Bob Butler launched the first pro soccer club in the New York City area since the NASL New York Cosmos of the 1970s and 1980s. Butler founded the New York Fever as a USISL Pro League team in 1994 with the objective of building a robust franchise and soccer training center for the large and untapped population and youth of New York City.

For the 1996 season, Goervic brought in Tom Neale to be the team's General Manager. Neale in turn brought in Mike Winograd, his college roommate and teammate at Lafayette College, to head up ticket sales, marketing and team development. After one season, Gorevic moved the franchise to Staten Island and tapped Neale and Winograd to start up a new team there. The franchise was named the Staten Island Vipers, which began play in the A-League in 1998. Neale ultimately went on to be General Manager of the San Jose Earthquakes and COO of the MetroStars of MLS.

The compound occurs as a white odorless solid, although commercial samples can be off-white and possess a slightly phenolic odor. It is insoluble in water but dissolves in acetone, ethanol, diethyl ether, and chloroform. In medicine, hexachlorophene is useful as a topical anti-infective, anti-bacterial agent, often used in soaps and toothpaste. It is also used in agriculture as a soil fungicide, plant bactericide, and acaricide.\n\nIn 1972, the \"Bébé\" brand of baby powder in France killed 39 babies. It also did great damage to the central nervous systems of several hundred other babies. The batch of toxic \"Bébé\" brand of powder was manufactured with 6% hexachlorophene. This industrial accident directly led to the removal of hexachlorophene from consumer products across the world.\n\nIn 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) halted the production and distribution of products containing more than 1% of hexachlorophene. After that point, most products that contain hexachlorophene were available only with a doctor's prescription. The restrictions were enacted after 15 deaths in the United States and 39 deaths in France were reported following brain damage caused by hexachlorophene.\n\nSeveral companies manufactured over-the-counter preparations which utilised hexachlorophene in their formulations. One product, \"Baby Magic Bath\" by The Mennen Company, was recalled in 1971, and removed from retail distribution.\n\nTwo commercial preparations using hexachlorophene, \"pHisoDerm\" and pHisoHex, were widely used as antibacterial skin cleansers in the treatment of acne, (with \"pHisoDerm\" developed for those allergic to the active ingredients in \"pHisoHex\"). During the 1960s, both were available over the counter in the US. After the ban, \"pHisoDerm\" was reformulated without hexachlorophene, and continued to be sold over-the-counter, while \"pHisoHex\", (which contained 3% hexachlorophene - 3 times the legal limit imposed in 1972), became available as a prescription body wash. In the European Community countries during the 1970s and 1980s, \"pHisoHex\" remained available over the counter. A related product, \"pHisoAc\", was used as a skin mask to dry and peel away acne lesions whilst \"pHiso-Scrub\", a hexachlorophene-impregnated sponge for scrubbing, has since been discontinued. Several substitute products (including triclosan) were developed, but none had the germ-killing capability of hexachlorophene. ( Sanofi-Aventis was the sole manufacturer of \"pHisoHex\", while The Mentholatum Company owns the \"pHisoDerm\" brand today. Sanofi-Aventis discontinued production of several forms of \"pHisoHex\" in August 2009 and discontinued all production of \"pHisoHex\" in September 2013).\n\nThe formula for Dial soap was modified to remove hexachlorophene after the FDA put an end to over-the-counter availability in 1972.\n\nBristol-Myers' discontinued Ipana Toothpaste brand, at one time, contained Hexochlorophene. \n\nAnother company involved in the production of products with hexachlorophene was cosmetic company, J.R. Watkins Company of Winona, Minnesota. They had previously produced \"Watkins Cologne for Men\".\n\nIn Germany, cosmetics containing hexachlorophene have been forbidden since 1985. \n\nIn Austria, sale of drugs containing the substance has been forbidden since 1990.\n\nHexacholorophene is produced by alkylation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol with formaldehyde. Related antiseptics are prepared similarly, e.g., bromochlorophene and dichlorophene.\n\nThe LD50 (oral, rat) is 59 mg/kg, indicating that the compound is relatively toxic. It is not mutagenic nor teratogenic according to Ullmann's Encyclopedia, but \"embryotoxic and produces some teratogenic effects\" according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) is always a contaminant in this compound's production. Several accidents releasing many kilograms of TCDD have been reported. The reaction between 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and Formaldehyde is exothermic. If the reaction occurs without adequate cooling, TCDD is produced in significant quantities as a byproduct and contaminant. The Seveso disaster and the Times Beach, Missouri contamination incident exemplify the industrial hazards of hexachlorophene production.\n\nTrade names for hexachlorophene include: \"Acigena\", \"Almederm\", \"AT7\", \"AT17\", \"Bilevon\", \"Exofene\", \"Fostril\", \"Gamophen\", \"G-11\", \"Germa-Medica\", \"Hexosan\", \"K-34\", \"Septisol\", \"Surofene\", \"M3\".\n"}

His books include \"The Transylvanian Trilogy\" (\"They Were Counted\", \"They Were Found Wanting\" and \"They Were Divided\"), and \"The Phoenix Land\".\n\nThe Bánffy family emerged in 15th century Transylvania and established itself among the foremost dynasties of the country. They owned a grand palace in Kolozsvár (, ), one of the main cities of Transylvania and one of the province's largest castles at Bonchida. One branch was raised to a barony in the 1660s, while another became counts in 1855. The barons produced a 19th-century prime minister of Hungary (Dezső Bánffy), and the counts held important offices at court. Among the latter was Count Miklós, born in Kolozsvár on December 30, 1873.\n\nBeginning his political career at the time when Hungary was a constituent of Austria-Hungary, Bánffy was elected a Member of Parliament in 1901 and became Director of the Hungarian State Theatres (1913–1918). Both a traditionalist and a member of the avant-garde, he wrote five plays, two books of short stories, and a distinguished novel. Overcoming fierce opposition, his intervention made it possible for Béla Bartók's works to have their first performance in Budapest.\n\nBánffy became Foreign Minister of Hungary in his cousin Count István Bethlen's government of 1921. Although he detested the politics of the Regent, Admiral Miklós Horthy, he worked to review the boundary revisions confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon after World War I through which Transylvania had been transferred to Romania. Little progress was made, and he retired from office.\n\nHis trilogy, \"A Transylvanian Tale\", also called \"The Writing on the Wall\", was published between 1934 and 1940. Bánffy portrayed pre-war Hungary as a nation in decline, failed by a shortsighted aristocracy.\n\nIn April 1943, Bánffy visited Bucharest to persuade Ion Antonescu's Romania together with Hungary to abandon the Axis and sue for a separate peace with the Allies (\"see also Romania during World War II\"). The negotiations with a delegation led by Gheorghe Mironescu broke down almost instantaneously, as the two sides could not agree on a future status for Northern Transylvania (which Romania had ceded to Hungary in 1940, and where Bonchida was located). Two years later, in revenge for Bánffy's actions in Bucharest, his estate at Bonchida was burned and looted by the retreating German army.\n\nHungary and Transylvania were soon invaded by the Soviet Union's Red Army, an event which marked an uncertain status for Northern Transylvania until its return to Romania. His wife and daughter fled to Budapest while Bánffy remained on the spot in a vain attempt to prevent the destruction of his property. Soon after, the frontier was closed. The family remained separated until 1949, when he was allowed by Romanian communist authorities to leave for Budapest, where he died the following year.\n\nA mellowing communist regime in Hungary permitted the reissue of \"A Transylvanian Tale\" in 1982, and it was translated into English for the first time in 1999. The Castle of Bonchida is now being restored as a cultural center. An apartment is being prepared for the use of the Count's family.\n\n"}

{"id": "1919008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919008", "title": "J. G. Farrell", "text": "J. G. Farrell\n\nJames Gordon Farrell (25 January 1935 – 11 August 1979) was an English-born novelist of Irish descent who spent much of his childhood in Ireland. He gained prominence for a series of novels known as \"the Empire Trilogy\" (\"Troubles\", \"The Siege of Krishnapur\" and \"The Singapore Grip\"), which deal with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule.\n\nFarrell's career abruptly ended when he drowned in Ireland at the age of 44, falling to his death in a storm. \"Had he not sadly died so young,” Salman Rushdie said in 2008, \"there is no question that he would today be one of the really major novelists of the English language. The three novels that he did leave are all in their different way extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Troubles\" received the 1971 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize and \"The Siege of Krishnapur\" received the 1973 Booker Prize. In 2010 \"Troubles\" was retrospectively awarded the Lost Man Booker Prize, created to recognise works published in 1970. \"Troubles\" and its fellow shortlisted works had not been open for consideration that year due to a change in the eligibility rules.\n\nFarrell, born in Liverpool into a family of Anglo-Irish background, was the second of three brothers. His father, William Farrell, had worked as an accountant in Bengal and, in 1929, he married Prudence Josephine Russell, a former receptionist and secretary to a doctor. From the age of 12 he attended Rossall School in Lancashire. After World War II, the Farrells moved to Dublin, after which Farrell spent much time in Ireland. This, perhaps combined with the popularity of \"Troubles\", leads many to regard him as an Irish writer. After leaving Rossall, he taught in Dublin and also worked for some time on Distant Early Warning Line in the Canadian Arctic. In 1956, he went to study at Brasenose College, Oxford; while there he contracted polio. This left him partially crippled and disease was prominent in his works. In 1960 he left Oxford with third-class honours in French and Spanish and went to live in France, where he taught at a lycée.\n\nFarrell published his first novel, \"A Man From Elsewhere\", in 1963. Set in France, it shows the clear influence of French existentialism. The story follows Sayer, who is a journalist for a communist paper, as he tries to find skeletons in Regan's closet. Regan is a dying novelist who is about to be awarded an important Catholic literary prize. The book mimics the fight between the two leaders of French existentialism: Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus (Sayer representing Sartre and Regan representing Camus). The two argue about existentialism: the position that murder can be vindicated as an expedient in overthrowing tyranny (Sartre) versus the stance that there are no ends that justify unjust means (Camus). Bernard Bergonzi reviewed it in the \"New Statesman\" in the 20 September 1963 issue and said, \"Many first novels are excessively autobiographical, but \"A Man from Elsewhere\" suffers from the opposite fault of being a cerebral construct, dreamed up out of literature and the contemporary French cinema.\" Simon Raven wrote in \"The Observer\" on 15 September 1963 that \"Mr. Farrell's style is spare, his plotting lucid and well timed; his expositions of moral or political problems are pungent if occasionally didactic.\" It entirely lacks the ironic humour and the tender appreciation of human frailty which characterise his later work. Farrell himself came to dislike the book.\n\nTwo years after this came \"The Lung\", in which Farrell returned to his real-life trauma of less than a decade earlier: the main character Martin Sands contracts polio and has to spend a long period in hospital. It has been noted that it is somewhat modelled after Farrell, but it is modelled more after Geoffrey Firmin from Malcolm Lowry's 1947 novel, \"Under the Volcano\". The anonymous reviewer for \"The Observer\" on 31 October 1965, wrote that \"Mr. Farrell gives the pleasantly solid impression of really having something to write about\" and one for \"The Times Literary Supplement\" on 11 November 1965 that \"Mr. Farrell's is an effective, potent brew, compounded of desperation and a certain wild hilarity.\"\n\nIn 1967, he published \"A Girl in the Head\". The protagonist, the impoverished Polish count Boris Slattery, lives in the fictional English seaside town of Maidenhair Bay, in the house of the Dongeon family (which is believed to be modelled after V. S. Naipaul's \"A House for Mr Biswas\"). His marriage to Flower Dongeon is decaying. His companion is Dr. Cohen, who is a dying alcoholic. Boris also has sex with an underaged teenager, June Furlough. He also fantasizes about Ines, a Swedish summer guest, who is the \"girl in the head\". Boris is believed to be modelled after Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita\". Like its two predecessors, the book met only middling critical and public reaction. In the 13 July 1967 issue of \"The Listener\", Ian Hamilton wrote that he disliked the novel, and thought it was, at best, an \"adroit pastiche\" of Samuel Beckett's deadbeats. Martin Levin in \"The New York Times Book Review\" on 23 March 1969 praised the author's \"flair for giving the ridiculous an inspired originality\". In an anonymous review in \"The New York Times Book Review\" on 20 July 1967, the writer stated that the \"verbal assurance and resourcefulness show that Mr. Farrell is not content to coast along merely imitating his previous work. Such a deliberate extension of range is perhaps a hopeful sign for a talent which, after three novels, still has not found the mode in which to fulfil its attractive promise.\"\n\n\"Troubles\" tells the comic yet melancholy tale of an Englishman, Major Brendan Archer, who in 1919 goes to County Wexford in Ireland to reunite with his fiancée, Angela Spencer. From the crumbling Majestic Hotel at Kilnalough, he watches Ireland's fight for independence from Britain. Farrell started writing this book while on a Harkness Fellowship in the United States and finished it in a tiny flat in Knightsbridge, London. He got the idea for the setting from going to Block Island and seeing the remains of an old burned-down hotel. He won a Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for the novel, and with the prize money travelled to India to research his next novel.\n\nFarrell's next book \"The Siege of Krishnapur\" and his last completed work \"The Singapore Grip\" both continue his story of the collapse of British colonial power. The former deals with the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Inspired by historical events such as the sieges of Cawnpore and Lucknow, the novel is set in the fictional town of Krishnapur, where a besieged British garrison succeeds in holding out for four months against an army of native sepoys, in the face of enormous suffering, before being relieved.\n\nThe third of the novels, \"The Singapore Grip\", centres upon the Japanese capture of the British colonial city of Singapore in 1942, while also exploring at some length the economics and ethics of colonialism at the time, as well as the economic relationships between developed and Third World countries at the time that Farrell was writing.\n\nThe three novels are in general linked only thematically, although Archer, a character in \"Troubles\", reappears in \"The Singapore Grip\". The protagonist of Farrell's unfinished novel, \"The Hill Station\", is Dr McNab, introduced in \"The Siege of Krishnapur\"; this novel and its accompanying notes make the series a quartet.\n\nWhen \"The Siege of Krishnapur\" won the Booker Prize in 1973, Farrell used his acceptance speech to attack the sponsors, the Booker Group, for their business involvement in the agricultural sector in the Third World.\n\nCharles Sturridge scripted a film version of \"Troubles\" made for British television in 1988 and directed by Christopher Morahan.\n\nIn 1979, Farrell decided to quit London to live on the Sheep's Head peninsula in County Cork, southwestern Ireland. A few months later he was drowned on the coast of Bantry Bay, after falling into the sea from rocks while angling. He was 44.\n\nHe is buried in the cemetery of St James's Church of Ireland in Durrus. The manuscript library at Trinity College, Dublin holds his papers: \"Papers of James Gordon Farrell (1935–1979). TCD MSS 9128-60\".\n\nPeter Morey wrote that \"an interpretation of the novels of J. G. Farrell and Paul Scott as examples of post-colonial fiction [is possible], since both partake of oppositional and interrogative narrative practices which recognize and work to dismantle the staple elements of imperial narrative.\"\n\nDerek Mahon dedicates his poem \"A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford\" to J. G. Farrell, possibly in reference to the topic of \"Troubles\".\n\nRonald Binns described Farrell's colonial novels as \"probably the most ambitious literary project conceived and executed by any British novelist in the 1970s.\"\n\nIn the 1984 novel \"Foreign Affairs\" by Alison Lurie, Vinnie Miner, the protagonist, reads a Farrell novel on her flight from New York to London. In the 1991 novel \"The Gates of Ivory\" by Margaret Drabble, the writer Stephen Cox is modelled on Farrell.\n\nFarrell said to George Brock in an interview for \"The Observer\", \"the really interesting thing that's happened during my lifetime has been the decline of the British Empire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She began her brief career as an actress while still a student working on productions supervised by Michael Barry who cast her in \"Toad of Toad Hall\", and later in the same year in \"The Insect Play\" (both 1950). She became more interested in working in television than acting, preferring a three-week assignment in the medium over a ten-week touring production in Ireland.\n\nShe was the first female floor manager to work for the BBC, her non-gendered credit being a means of avoiding problems with prospective technical crews. Although she appeared in the first two episodes of \"The Quatermass Experiment\" (1953), her main role was a production assistant for television director Rudolph Cartier. She worked on the later \"Quatermass\" science-fiction serials, as well as the 1954 adaptation of George Orwell's novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". In the \"Studio 4\" series, she appeared on screen in the Cartier directed Holocaust drama \"Doctor Korczak and the Children\" (1962) instructing the actors on the roles they were to perform. The production was made in the unadorned studio without sets or the actors in costume.\n\nShe progressed to becoming a director herself, one of the first two women directors in BBC television. She directed many television programmes from 1962. She became the first woman to direct episodes of \"Doctor Who\" when she directed \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\" (1966). She directed three further \"Doctor Who\" serials: \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\" (1974), \"Pyramids of Mars\" (1975), and \"Horror of Fang Rock\" (1977). The last two \"Doctor Who\" serials featured Tom Baker in the title role. She told \"Doctor Who Magazine\": \"Tom Baker was easy to deal with at first, but the part went to his head completely. By the time I did \"Horror of Fang Rock\", he was desperately difficult to work with\". Her other work included \"Out of the Unknown\" (1965), \"Pere Goriot\" (1968), \"The Moonstone\" (1972) and \"The Omega Factor\" (1980).\n\nBy the 1980s, Russell was living in a cottage in Oxenhope, on the Yorkshire Moors near Keighley. She was working regularly for Yorkshire Television for whom she directed many episodes of \"Emmerdale\", the quiz programme \"3-2-1\" in its early years and the local news programme, \"Calendar\". She was actively involved in charitable work in the area with particular emphasis on domestic cats.\n\nRussell moved to a care home, where she died in 2017, aged 89.\n"}

The solid-fuel second stage was built by KARI, the national space agency of South Korea, and Korean Air.\n\nNeither the maiden flight on 25 August 2009 nor the second flight on 10 June 2010 reached orbit. The third flight on 30 January 2013 successfully reached orbit. The launches took place from the Naro Space Center. The official name of the first KSLV rocket, KSLV-I, is Naro, which is the name of the region in which Naro Space Center is located.\n\nIn 1992, Republic of Korea developed and launched several satellite systems and rockets overseas, such as the solid-fueled KSR-1 and KSR-2 sounding rockets. In 2000, Republic of Korea began construction of the Naro Space Center, located on Naro Island in Goheung, south of Seoul, with Russian assistance. The work was completed by the launch of the KSR-3 liquid-propellant sounding rocket on 28 November 2002. South Korea announced in 2002 that it intended to develop a small satellite launch vehicle by 2005 that would be based on technology flown on the KSR-3 test vehicle. The launcher would be entirely indigenous, based on the thrust LOX/kerosene motor used for the KSR-3 rocket stage. In 2005 a change was announced, indicating that they would use the Russian RD-191 as the vehicle's first stage. The program, like that of the Angara, was subject to continuous funding shortages and schedule delays.\n\nOn 26 October 2004, during the visit of a GKNPTs Khrunichev delegation headed by A. A. Medvedev, Director General to Republic of Korea, a contract was signed to design and build a Space Rocket Complex for the small-lift launch vehicle KSLV-1. The design represented a joint effort between GKNPTs Khrunichev partner NPO Energomash \"V. P. Glushko\", who would build the first stage of KSLV-1, and Republic of Korea KARI, who would design and produce the second stage. As the prerequisite to signing the contract South Korea joined the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). All documentation was reviewed by the Russian Space Agency (RSA), and the joint project to build the Korean rocket complex was approved. The vehicle was unveiled at the Naro Space Center in Goheung, South Jeolla Province in October 2008. South Korea has spent some KR₩ 500 billion (US$ 490 million) since 2002 on the project.\n\nThe total cost of the first three launches was over 500 billion won (US$450 million), raising concerns among the Korean populace about the value of the Naro space program.\n\nRepublic of Korea efforts to build an indigenous space launch vehicle is hindered due to persistent political pressure of the United States, who had for many decades hindered South Korea's indigenous rocket and missile development programs in fear of their possible connection to clandestine military ballistic missile programs. South Korea has sought the assistance of foreign countries such as Russia through MTCR commitments to supplement its restricted domestic rocket technology. South Korea is working on an engine for an indigenous launcher planned for 2021.\n\nThe whole rocket was originally planned to be completely indigenous, but due to technological constraints largely spurred by political pressure from the United States that discouraged independent research and development of rocket technology by South Korea, KARI decided that the KSLV would be built on the basis of the universal rocket module (URM) designed for the Russian Angara family of rockets. The first stage of the vehicle uses the Russian RD-151 engine, which is essentially the RD-191 de-powered to 170 tonnes-force (1.7 MN; 370,000 lbf) from 190 tonnes. The second stage is a solid rocket motor developed and built by KARI. The launch vehicle weighs , stands tall and has a diameter of almost .\n\nThe first launch of the Naro-1 took place on . The rocket was launched from the Naro Space Center. The Khrunichev-built first stage reportedly performed nominally, and the second stage separation took place as expected, but the payload fairing separation system malfunctioned and half of the satellite protective cover stayed bolted to the second stage. The added weight of the remaining fairing caused the rocket to tumble upwards and to be thrown off its nominal course, soaring above the planned altitude before falling down. The payload (STSAT-2) reentered the atmosphere and disintegrated.\n\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea officially approved the launch of the KSLV in June 2009, which was expected to send the STSAT-2A satellite into orbit. The launch was first tentatively scheduled for 11 August, after receiving approval from the National Space Committee.\nThe first actual attempt to launch Naro-1 was conducted on , but the launch was canceled seven minutes 56 seconds before launch.\n\n The launch of the second Naro-1 took place on at 08:01 UTC. The launch ended in failure 137 seconds (2 minutes 17 seconds) later, when contact with the rocket was lost. Ahn Byung-man, Minister of Science and Technology, told reporters that the rocket was believed to have exploded in midair. The launch originally had been scheduled for , but was postponed due to a malfunction of a fire protection system.\n\nThirteen engineering experts from Republic of Korea and thirteen from Russian Federation formed a Failure Review Board and met in August 2010 to discuss the launch. They were able to officially conclude that the launch had failed. Further investigation was ongoing as to the cause of the failure. As of 11 November 2010, a definitive cause for the failure had not been determined. According to the Director-General of GKNPTs Khrunichev, Vladimir Nesterov, the telemetry data received by his company does not point to any off-nominal performance of the Khrunichev-built first stage. A new team consisting of 30 experts was formed to investigate the cause of the failure. According to findings of a Russian independent commission made public in August 2011, an error had occurred in the rocket's second stage produced by KARI.\n\nNaro-1 became the first South Korean launch vehicle to achieve Earth orbit on January 30, 2013, when it was successfully used to launch the Science and Technology Satellite 2C (STSAT-2C). Naro-1 launched from the Naro Space Center, located 480 kilometers south of Seoul,\n\nLaunch of the third flight was postponed from its original launch date of late October to sometime in mid to late November due to a damaged rubber ring that caused a fuel leak. A launch countdown on 29 November was halted 17 minutes prior to launch due to an excessive electric current reading, indicating some type of electrical malfunction. Diagnosing and correcting the problem were reported to require delaying the launch for at least four days. \nThe Republic of Korea government announced this would be the final flight attempt. Had the mission failed there would not be another attempt and the project would come to an end.\n\nWhile the immediate cause of the leak was a damaged rubber seal further investigation into the failure revealed a defective adapter bloc linking the rocket to the port. Korean ministry announced that the new adapters will be brought in from Russia in preparation for the launch. A new preliminary launch date no earlier than 24 November 2012 was also announced.\n\nWhile no cause for the failure of the second launch has officially been declared, changes to the third launch were to include eliminating the flight termination system on the second stage (built by Republic of Korea KARI), and changes to the system on the first stage (supplied by Russia). Changes to the electrical system that operates the payload fairing were also to be made.\nThe first stage of the rocket Naro-1 for the third attempt was delivered from the Russian manufacturer at the end of August 2012.\n\nShortly after the mishap with the second launch attempt, South Korea had announced the third flight would take place in 2011. Specific plans were never announced and no launch attempt was made in 2011.\n\nThe third launch of Naro-1 occurred one month after North Korea's successful December 2012 launch of their Unha-3 rocket developed with North Korean technology. The launch came in the wake of news that North Korea had plans for a third nuclear test. Chinese Navy official Yin Zhuo said that South Korea has been competing with Japan for favor with the United States, and the launch aims to strengthen relations with the U.S.\n\n\n\n"}

A \"cum laude\" graduate of Brooklyn College in 1944, Kupferberg founded the magazine \"Birth\" in 1958.\n\nKupferberg reportedly appears in Ginsberg's poem \"Howl\" as the person \"who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways & firetrucks, not even one free beer.\" The incident in question actually occurred on the Manhattan Bridge. Ginsberg's description in \"Howl\" uses poetic license. Kupferberg did jump from the Manhattan Bridge in 1944, after which he was picked up by a passing tugboat and taken to Gouverneur Hospital. Severely injured, he had broken the transverse process of his spine and spent time in a body cast.\n\nIn 1964, Kupferberg formed the satirical rock group the Fugs with poet Ed Sanders.\nKupferberg was active in New York pacifist-anarchist circles. In 1965 he was one of the lecturers at the newly founded Free University of New York. He appeared as a machine-gun-toting soldier policing Manhattan in \"\", a 1971 film about the revolutionary psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich by Dušan Makavejev. An anti-police-brutality skit from his Revolting Theatre appeared in the 1971 Richard Pryor underground film \"Dynamite Chicken\". In 1972, Kupferberg played the role of God in the Canadian experimental film \"Voulez-vous coucher avec God?\". Kupferberg later appeared in the music video for \"Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror\" by Jeffrey Lewis.\n\nKupferberg suffered a stroke in April 2009 at his home in New York City, which left him severely visually impaired and in need of regular nursing care. After treatment for a number of days at a New York hospital, followed by convalescence at a nursing home, he recuperated at home.\n\nKupferberg died in New York Downtown Hospital in Manhattan of kidney failure and sepsis on July 12, 2010. In 2008, in one of his last interviews, he told \"Mojo Magazine\", \"Nobody who lived through the '50s thought the '60s could've existed. So there's always hope.\"\n\n\n"}

Because a switched fabric network spreads network traffic across multiple physical links, it yields higher total throughput than broadcast networks, such as the early 10BASE5 version of Ethernet, or most wireless networks such as Wi-Fi.\n\nThe generation of high-speed serial data interconnects that appeared in 2001–2004 which provided point-to-point connectivity between processor and peripheral devices are sometimes referred to as fabrics; however, they lack features such as a message passing protocol. For example, HyperTransport, the computer processor interconnect technology, continues to maintain a processor bus focus even after adopting a higher speed physical layer. Similarly, PCI Express is just a serial version of PCI; it adheres to PCI's host/peripheral load/store direct memory access (DMA)-based architecture on top of a serial physical and link layer.\n\nIn the Fibre Channel S\"witched Fabric\" (\"FC-SW-6\") topology, devices are connected to each other through one or more Fibre Channel switches. While this topology has the best scalability of the three FC topologies (the other two are Arbitrated Loop and point-to-point), it is the only one requiring switches, which are costly hardware devices.\n\nVisibility among devices (called \"nodes\") in a fabric is typically controlled with Fibre Channel zoning.\n\nMultiple switches in a fabric usually form a mesh network, with devices being on the \"edges\" (\"leaves\") of the mesh. Most Fibre Channel network designs employ two separate fabrics for redundancy. The two fabrics share the edge nodes (devices), but are otherwise unconnected. One of the advantages of such setup is capability of failover, meaning that in case one link breaks or a fabric goes out of order, datagrams can be sent via the second fabric.\n\nThe fabric topology allows the connection of up to the theoretical maximum of 16 million devices, limited only by the available address space (2).\n\n\n"}
