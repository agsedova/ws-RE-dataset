She was built in 1927 as an ocean liner and refrigerated cargo ship, converted in 1929 into a cruise ship and requisitioned as a troop ship in the Second World War. At the end of June 1940 she was assigned the task of transporting Italian and German civilians among a small number of prisoners of war to Canada. On 2 July 1940 she was sunk in controversial circumstances by a German U-boat with a large loss of life, 805 people.\n\nIn 1925 Blue Star ordered a set of new liners for its new London – Rio de Janeiro – Buenos Aires route. Cammell Laird of Birkenhead built three sister ships: \"Almeda\", \"Andalucia\" and \"Arandora\". John Brown & Company of Clydebank built two: \"Avelona\" and \"Avila\". Together the quintet came to be called the \"luxury five\".\n\nCammell Laird launched \"Arandora\" on 4 January 1927 and completed her in May. As originally built she measured , was long, had a beam of and accommodated 164 first class passengers. She had a service speed of . A major refit in 1929 reduced her cargo space and increased her passenger accommodation to turn her into a cruise ship.\n\nAs \"Arandora\" she sailed from London to the east coast of South America from 1927 to 1928. In 1929 she was sent to Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Limited of Glasgow for refitting. In the refit, her gross tonnage was increased to 14,694 and first class accommodation was increased to 354 passengers. A tennis court was also placed aft of the funnels on the boat deck and a swimming pool was installed in the after well deck. Upon completion, she returned to service as a full-time luxury cruise ship. At the time of this refit, she was also renamed \"Arandora Star\". The renaming was done to avoid confusion with Royal Mail Ships which typically bore names beginning and ending in \"A\". \n\nAs a cruise ship \"Arandora Star\" was based mainly in Southampton, and voyaged to many different destinations, calling in some instances at home ports such as Immingham. Cruises included Norway, the Northern capitals, the Mediterranean, the West Indies, Panama, Cuba, and Florida. \"Arandora Star\" also had two unique nicknames because of her colour scheme of a white hull with scarlet ribbon. The nicknames most frequently used were \"The Wedding Cake\" or the \"Chocolate Box\".\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out in September 1939, \"Arandora Star\" was \"en route\" from Cherbourg to New York. She returned to Britain \"via\" Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she joined the very first HX-series convoy, Convoy HX 1.\n\nAt the end of September, the Admiralty assessed the ship at Dartmouth, Devon and decided she was unsuitable for conversion to an armed merchant cruiser. In December, she was ordered to Avonmouth where she was fitted with the Admiralty Net Defence anti-torpedo system, consisting of underwater wire mesh suspended from booms either side of the ship. She was fitted out at Avonmouth and then spent three months based at Portsmouth testing nets of various gauges in the English Channel. On tests the system was successful at catching torpedoes and reduced \"Arandora Star\"s speed by only . In March 1940, the ship was sent to Devonport where the equipment was removed. She was then sent to Liverpool for orders.\n\nOn 30 May, the ship left Liverpool for Norway to help evacuate Allied troops. She sailed unescorted to Harstad, where she embarked 1,600 personnel; most of them members of the Royal Air Force in addition to some French and Polish troops. She left Harstad on 7 June and took her evacuees to Glasgow.\n\nOn 14 June, the ship left Glasgow en route for Brest, in Brittany, to rescue troops and refugees. Continuous \"Luftwaffe\" attacks on the port and town prevented her from entering, and only 12 refugees managed to get out by boat to the ship. \"Arandora Star\" escaped with the aid of a destroyer, which provided anti-aircraft cover and came under heavy air attack. The liner took her handful of evacuees to Falmouth, where she bunkered. She then went to Quiberon Bay, on the Bay of Biscay, where she evacuated about 300 people from Saint-Nazaire on 17 June. Sources disagree whether she took these to Falmouth or Plymouth. \"Arandora Star\"s trip to Saint-Nazaire was fairly uneventful; the same day, \"Luftwaffe\" aircraft sank at the port killing several thousand people.\n\n\"Arandora Star\"s next trip to France was to the southwest, near the border with Spain. There she found Bayonne under \"Luftwaffe\" attack, but assisted by a destroyer, she picked up about 500 people who were in an overloaded small craft adrift off the beach. These she took to Falmouth, before returning to the same area. She entered Saint-Jean-de-Luz, where some Polish troops were trapped. She embarked roughly 1,700 troops and refugees, including the Polish staff, and left just in time as \"Luftwaffe\" aircraft approached to bomb the town. She took her evacuees to Liverpool.\n\nWhat became \"Arandora Star\"s final voyage, was the transport of Italian and German internees as well as German prisoners of war to Canada. In Liverpool on 27–30 June, she embarked 734 interned Italian men, 479 interned German men, 86 German prisoners of war, 200 military guards, in addition to her crew of 174 officers and men. Her Master was Captain Edgar Wallace Moulton. The ship was bound for St John's, Newfoundland, and her internees for Canadian internment camps.\n\nSources disagree as to whether the ship left Liverpool on 30 June, or at 4 h on 2 July 1940. She sailed unescorted, and early on the morning of 2 July she was about 75 miles west of Bloody Foreland when she was torpedoed. , commanded by Günther Prien, struck \"Arandora Star\" with a single torpedo. Prien believed the torpedo to be faulty, but it detonated against \"Arandora Star\"s starboard side, flooding her aft engine room. All engine room personnel, including two engineer officers, were killed. Her turbines, main generators and emergency generators were all immediately put out of action and therefore knocked out all lights and communications aboard.\n\nChief officer Frederick Brown gave the ship's position to the radio officer, who transmitted a distress signal. At 7:5 hours Malin Head radio acknowledged the message and retransmitted to Land's End and to Portpatrick.\n\nThe cruise ship carried 14 lifeboats and 90 liferafts. The torpedo destroyed one starboard and disabled the davits and falls of another. Two boats were damaged during their launch and thus useless. The crew successfully launched the remaining 10 boats and more than half the liferafts. Some boats were overloaded by prisoners descending the falls and side ladders, but many of the Italians were afraid to leave the ship. At least four of the remaining lifeboats were launched with a very small number of survivors. One other lifeboat was swamped and sank shortly after being launched.\n\nOne of the internees was Captain Otto Burfeind, who had been interned after scuttling his ship, the . Burfeind stayed aboard \"Arandora Star\" organizing her evacuation until she sank and he was lost.\n\nThe ship listed further to starboard. At 7:15, Captain Moulton and his senior officers walked over the side into the rising water, leaving behind many Italians who were still afraid to leave the ship. At 7:20, the ship rolled over, raised her bow in the air and sank. 805 people were killed, including Captain Moulton, 12 of his officers, 42 of his crew and 37 of the military guards. \n\nAt 9:30, an RAF Coastal Command Short Sunderland flying boat flew over and dropped watertight bags containing first aid kits, food, cigarettes, and a message that help was coming. The aircraft circled until 13:00, when the Canadian C-class destroyer HMCS \"St. Laurent\" arrived and rescued 868 survivors, of whom 586 were detainees. The injured were taken to Mearnskirk Hospital in Newton Mearns, Glasgow. One of the survivors was the athletics coach Franz Stampfl.\n\nOn 3 July, the UK War Cabinet received a report on the disaster. Its impact was overshadowed by the Royal Navy attack on Mers-el-Kébir, French Algeria, that sank elements of the French battle fleet. Throughout July and August, bodies were washed up on the Irish shore. On 30 July, the first body was found; 71-year-old Ernesto Moruzzi, who was found at Cloughglass, Burtonport. Four others were found on the same day. During August 1940, 213 bodies washed up on the Irish coast, of which 35 were from \"Arandora Star\" and a further 92 unidentified, potentially from the ship.\n\nCaptain Moulton was posthumously awarded Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea. Captain Burfeind was posthumously cited for his heroism in the evacuation, and the Canadian commander Harry DeWolf was cited for his heroism in the rescue.\n\nThe wreck's position is .\n\nIn the weeks following the \"Arandora Star\"s sinking many bodies of those who perished were carried by the sea to various points in Ireland and the Hebrides. In the small graveyard of Termoncarragh, Belmullet, County Mayo, Luigi Tapparo, an internee, from Edinburgh, and John Connelly, a Lovat Scout, lie buried side by side. Belmullet gardaí received a call from Annagh Head that another body had been found. From a service book on the body, Garda Sergeant Burns identified 27-year-old Trooper Frank Carter of the Royal Dragoons, a career soldier and a married man, from Kilburn, London. Ceazar Camozzi (1891–1940) from Iseo, Italy was washed ashore on the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal and is buried at Sacred Heart graveyard, Carndonagh. 46 German civilian detainees, who were being shipped from England to Canada for internment when the ship sank, were buried in the German war cemetery in Glencree, County Wicklow.\nPrivate E.G. Lane, of The Devonshire Regiment, from Kingsteignton, Newton Abbot, Devon, England, his body was washed onto the beach close to Ballycastle, Co. Mayo and was buried in the local cemetery. His grave was re-dedicated in 2009 by the Mayo Peace Park Committee.\n\nAn unidentified sailor, unrecognisable other than for a tattoo bearing the name \"Chrissie\", was washed ashore near Newhouse, on the Atlantic coast of Kintyre, Argyll and, after official investigation, buried at the local churchyard of Killean, Kintyre, Argyll.\n\nA memorial chapel was built in a cemetery in Bardi, home town of 48 of the dead, and an annual commemorative mass is held in the town. A street in Bardi was renamed \"Via Arandora Star\".\nSt Peter's Italian Church in Clerkenwell, London, unveiled a wall memorial in 1960, and added a second memorial to London victims in 2012.\n\nIn 2004 the Italian town of Lucca unveiled a monument to 31 local men lost in the sinking, located in the courtyard of the museum of the Paolo Cresci Foundation for the History of Italian Emigration.. There is also a Via Arandora Star in Parma.\n\nNumerous bodies were found on the Scottish island of Colonsay. A memorial was unveiled on Colonsay on 2 July 2005, the 65th anniversary of the tragedy, at the cliff where the body of Giuseppe Delgrosso was found.\n\nA bronze memorial plaque was unveiled on 2 July 2008 at the Church of Our Lady and St Nicholas, Liverpool. It was relocated to the Pier Head in front of the old Mersey Docks and Harbour Board building after building work was finished.\n\nIn 2009, the 69th anniversary of the sinking, the Mayor of Middlesbrough unveiled a memorial in the town hall commemorating the town's 13 interned Italians held in cells there prior to deportation and death on the \"Arandora Star\"s final voyage.\n\nOn 2 July 2010, the 70th anniversary of the sinking, a new memorial was unveiled in St David's Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, Cardiff by the Arandora Star Memorial Fund in Wales.\nOn the same day, 2 July 2010, a memorial cloister garden was opened next to St Andrew's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Glasgow. Archbishop Mario Conti said at the time he hoped the monument would be a \"fitting symbol\" of the friendship between Scotland and Italy.\n\nThe wreckage of one of the lifeboats remains visible at Knockvologan beach on the Ross of Mull, largely buried but with its iron suspension hooks still above the sand. Photographs of the lifeboat remains in 1969, as well as an eyewitness account by a Ms. Bella MacLennanin can be found in the citation. A 2006 picture shows the build up of sand over time.\n\n\n\n"}

He has directed many music videos for popular artists.\n\nBryan Barber takes inspiration from many sources and says his upbringing has always helped form his vision. For Barber, writing and directing began as an outlet to have a voice. Raised by a single mother in the heart of Silicon Valley, before it was a coined phrase, Barber viewed life as a teen from the streets of East Palo Alto, California. Only two miles from where Steve Jobs was building Apple, Barber was writing stories in what was at the time the murder capital of the nation.\n\nBryan moved to Sacramento at the age of sixteen. His early love for film led him to work for Tower Records video distribution center and Tower Video during high school. While working at Tower, Barber learned early on that storytelling would be his way to bridge the gap between economic and racial divides. His family was involved in art and activism, so it was only natural that Barber would follow suit, but it wouldn't be easy.\n\nBarber failed out of three colleges before finally deciding to study film at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia. The challenge for him was taking his studies seriously. Eventually, a short film written and directed by Barber won him a trip to the Tel Aviv International Student Film Festival sponsored by the United Negro College Fund. From that experience, he knew he had a place as a filmmaker.\n\nAfter graduating college, Barber worked as a production assistant (PA) on the feature Black Dog directed by Kevin Hooks. However, steady work was hard to find. Barber worked many jobs as a production assistant (PA), an assistant editor, and he worked at a telecine film- processing lab in Atlanta before finally saving enough money to buy his 16mm camera, with assistance from his grandparents. “Without the help of my grandparents, I would have been a PA forever,” explains Barber.\n\n“Back then the barrier of entry for directing was too expensive,” Barber states. However, Barber was determined. Owning a camera allowed him to focus on directing. For him the timing was right. There was a boom in the music industry in Atlanta and not many music video directors. “I grew up admiring all of these guys who had cut their teeth on directing music videos, directors like John Landis, Ridley Scott, Michael Bay, David Fincher, and Spike Lee. Barber states, “I knew if I wanted to make movies the easiest way to gain experience was through following their footsteps.”\n\nBarber directed his first music video, Skew It on the Bar-B in 1998 for Outkast. Barber soon became known for his original, left of center, narrative video scripts, and visual directing style.\n\nEarly on, Barber produced his videos through his own company, Bush Harbor Filmworks, Inc. He eventually joined a major production company where his success as a director took off working with stars like Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera, Mary J. Blige, Dr. Dre, Kanye West, Janet Jackson, and Wiz Khalifa. This led to him being a groundbreaker in the field and hailing several award-winning classic videos.\n\nBarber has directed more than 200 music videos; 40 commercials; and wrote, directed, and produced various television and film projects.\n\nBarber received a Grammy nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form for directing Outkast's \"Hey Ya!\". He is also the winner of three MTV awards; five BET awards; two Soul Train Michael Jackson Icon Awards; five MVPA awards; and two Much Music awards. His videos and artist collaborations have amassed over 100 million albums sold worldwide.\n\nBarber has also directed numerous commercials for clients such as Pepsi, Target, CoverGirl, Chevrolet, Verizon, Shoe Carnival, Sony, and The Sugar Bowl.\n\nAfter a decade of pushing the genre, Barber was inspired to move into feature films with his debut of the HBO/Universal Studios produced Idlewild written, directed, and co-produced by Barber. A 1930s musical set in the fictional Georgia town of Idlewild (inspired by the Michigan resort town that served as a safe vacation haven for middle-class blacks in the pre-Civil Rights era). The film starred OutKast (whose members include André 3000 and Big Boi), Paula Patton, Terrence Howard and Faizon Love. OutKast also produced \"Idlewild (album)\" an accompanying album.\n\nAfter Idlewild, Barber had the opportunity to work on several television projects. Most notably, Barber directed episodes of the Nickelodeon sitcom, Instant Mom, starring Tia Mowry.\n\nBarber spent \"$50,000 for a presentation that included motion capture, stunts, concept art, storyboards and sound design\" to try to get the job directing \"\" from 20th Century Fox. He did not get the job but Fox was impressed enough with it that they reimbursed Barber. Barber is currently working on an adaptation of \"Gigantor\" after acquiring the rights from Fred Ladd.\n\n"}
{"id": "2075860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075860", "title": "Slowly I Turned", "text": "Slowly I Turned\n\n\"Slowly I Turned\" is a popular vaudeville sketch wherein a character is relating a story and is triggered into violent outbursts when the listener inadvertently utters a triggering word or phrase. Versions have also been performed in movies and on television. Comedians Harry Steppe, Joey Faye, and Samuel Goldman each laid claim to this routine, also referred to as \"The Stranger with a Kind Face\" by clowns, \"Niagara Falls\" by fans of The Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello, \"Martha\" by fans of \" I Love Lucy\", \"Pokomoko\", and \"Bagel Street\".\n\nThe routine features a man recounting the day he took his revenge on his enemy – and becoming so engrossed in his own tale that he attacks the innocent listener to whom he is speaking. The attacker comes to his senses, only to go berserk again when the listener says something that triggers the old memory again.\n\nTypically, the routine has two characters meeting for the first time, with one of them becoming highly agitated over the utterance of particular words. Names and cities (such as Niagara Falls) have been used as the trigger, which then sends the unbalanced person into a state of mania; the implication is that the words have an unpleasant association in the character's past. While the other character merely acts bewildered, the crazed character relives the incident, uttering the words, \"Slowly I turned ... step by step ... inch by inch...,\" as he approaches the stunned onlooker. Reacting as if this stranger is the object of his rage, the angry character begins hitting or strangling him, until the screams of the victim shake him out of his delusion. The character then apologizes, admitting his irrational reaction to the mention of those certain words. This follows with the victim innocently repeating the words, sparking the insane reaction all over again. This pattern is repeated in various forms, sometimes with the entrance of a third actor, uninformed as to the situation. This third person predictably ends up mentioning the words and setting off the manic character, but with the twist that the second character, not this new third person, is still the recipient of the violence.\n\nAbbott and Costello performed the \"Pokomoko\" version in their 1944 film \"Lost in a Harem,\" and later did a \"Niagara Falls\" version for their early '50s television show, with Sidney Fields, who played many characters, as the delusional man beating Costello while they were both locked in a jail cell. The television version ended with Costello’s troublesome lawyer, also played by Fields, entering the scene. Costello asks for the lawyer to take the case of the storytelling stranger, and the lawyer says, \"Help him out? I don’t know anything about him! What’s his name? Where is he from?\" Costello whispers in the Fields' ear, to which he responds aloud, \"Niagara Falls?\" and then he is immediately attacked. Another variation on the Abbott and Costello Show was the Susquehanna Hat Company/Bagel Street routine, also done as the Floogle Street routine.\n\nThe Three Stooges performed the sketch (as part of the show they put on within the movie, as they play performers) in \"Gents Without Cents\", a 1944 short. In their version, the final punchline is that the third character to arrive (played by Larry) is, in fact, the object of the hate of the storyteller (played by Moe). However, even though Curly (who has just been repeatedly beaten up by Moe and Larry, who is also triggered by the sketch’s word, which is \"Niagara Falls\") eggs him on, Moe refuses to attack Larry and instead they make peace. Curly then says \"Niagara Falls\" and both Moe \"and\" Larry chase him off the stage.\n\nThe routine also appears in episode 19, \"The Ballet\" of season 1 of \"I Love Lucy\", with Lucy playing the stranger with a kind face and a clown playing the storyteller, with the trigger word \"Martha\". Lucille Ball later performed the \"Martha\" version on \"CBS Opening Night\" in 1963, now playing the vagabond storyteller herself, with Phil Silvers as the stranger with the kind face.\n\nDanny Thomas and Joey Faye reprised the routine in Season 8, episode 20 (\"Good Old Burlesque\") of the \"Danny Thomas Show\". Hawkeye Pierce (played by Alan Alda) references this routine in the second-season \"M*A*S*H\" episode \"Dr. Pierce and Mr. Hyde\", in which the sleep-deprived surgeon insists on responding to an ambulance arrival.\n\nSteve Martin's character Rigby Reardon had a similar trigger, the words \"cleaning woman\", in his film noir homage \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\".\n\nMilton Berle's performance of this routine was played on the Dr. Demento radio show several times using the trigger word \"Buffalo\".\n\nThe lyrics of \"Native Love\" by the drag singer Divine are based on this routine, along with \"Don't Call Me Dude\" by eclectic thrash metal band Scatterbrain.\n\nPerforming this routine on \"Your Show of Shows\" in the early 1950s, Sid Caesar plays the poor sap who gets beaten up, and Imogene Coca plays a distraught manic lamenting her life with \"Jeffery\", the trigger word, who is prevented from throwing herself off the Empire State Building by Caesar's character. In the end, she runs off just as another woman comes running over to jump off the building. Caesar stops her, but rather than go through all that again, he jumps off instead.\n\n"}

The Vai are known for their indigenous syllabic writing system known as Vai syllabary, developed in the 1820s by Momolu Duwalu Bukele and other tribal elders. Over the course of the 19th century, literacy in the writing system became widespread. Its use declined over the 20th century, but modern computer technology may enable a revival.\n\nThe Vai people speak the Vai language, which is of the Mande languages. The Sierra Leonean Vai are predominantly found in Pujehun District (around the Liberian border) . Many Sierra Leonean villages that border Liberia are populated by the Vai. In total only about 1200 Vai live in Sierra Leone.\nThe earliest written documentation of the Vai is by Dutch merchants sometime in the first half of the seventeenth century, denoting a political group near Cape Mount. The Vai likely settled there as part of the Mane invasions from the Mali Empire in the middle of the sixteenth century and, according to Vai oral tradition were led by the brothers Fábule and Kīatámba in conquering the land down to the coast. \n\nIn many aspects, the Vai are a unique African ethnicity. Many believe that the region inhabited by the Vai is the original home of the Poro, a male secret society known throughout West Africa. The Vai are also quite musical. They play many instruments and perform dances on special occasions.\n\nThe Vai have three types of schooling. The first and most important is the bush school, where the children learn traditional Vai socialization skills, important survival skills, and other traits of village life for four to five years. Second is the English school; some Vai children attend English schools to learn the English language. Finally, there are the Quranic schools, where Vai children are taught the Arabic language under the guidance of the local Muslim religious leader.\nThe Vai are predominantly Muslim, and have for centuries practiced traditions rooted in studying the Quran, with a minority being Christian.\n\nThese monotheistic religions however coexist with traditional beliefs in the supernatural, and shamanistic practices are common as people consider themselves to be surrounded by spirits that can change into living creatures or objects. These spirits are believed to have the power to do evil to individuals or to the whole tribe. The Vai perform ceremonies for the dead in which they leave articles of clothing and food near the graves of the deceased.\n\nMost Vai make their living by farming the fertile land. Rice is their staple crop and can be cultivated with other vegetables on upland plots of cleared land. In addition to rice, crops such as cotton, corn, pumpkins, bananas, ginger, coffee, and cocoa are raised. The Vai also gather various nuts and berries from the forests. The palm tree is an important commodity to the Vai. Nuts, butter, wine, fuel, soap, and baskets are among its many derivatives.\n\n\n"}

More commonly the set square bears the markings of a ruler and a half circle protractor. The outer edges are typically bevelled. These set squares come in two usual forms, both right triangles: one with 90-45-45 degree angles, the other with 30-60-90 degree angles. Combining the two forms by placing the hypotenuses together will also yield 15° and 75° angles. They are often purchased in packs with protractors and compasses.\n\nLess commonly found is the adjustable set square. Here, the body of the object is cut in half and rejoined with a hinge marked with angles. Adjustment to the marked angle will produce any desired angle up to a maximum of 180°.\nIn many European countries, the most common form of set square combines a 90-45-45 triangle with a protractor into a single tool made of clear plastic. Named \"Geodreieck\" (German colloquial short form of \"Geometrie-Dreieick\", meaning \"geometry triangle\"), it was originally developed and trademarked by the German-Austrian manufacturer \"Aristo-Instrumente Dennert KG\" (now \"GEOtec Zeichen- und Kunststofftechnik GmbH\") in 1964.\n\n"}

He is younger brother of the Rakshasa king Ravana of Lanka. Though a Rakshasa himself, Vibhishana was of a noble character and advised Ravana, who kidnapped and abducted Sita, to return her to her husband Rama in an orderly fashion and promptly which Ravana refused sternly. When Ravana did not heed his advice, Vibhishana deserted Ravana and joined Rama's army. Later, when Rama defeated Ravana, Rama crowned Vibhishana as the king of Lanka and he returned to Ayodhya.\n\nVibhishana had a sattvic (pure) mind and a sattvic heart. From his early childhood, he spent all his time meditating on the name of the Lord. Eventually, Brahma appeared and offered him any boon he wanted. Vibhishana said that the only thing he wanted was to have his mind fixed at the feet of the Lord as pure as lotus leaves (charan kamal). He prayed that he should be given the strength by which he would always be at the feet of the Lord and that he would receive the darshan (holy sight) of Lord Vishnu. This prayer was fulfilled when he was able to give up all his wealth and family, and join Rama, who was Avatar of Lord Vishnu (God incarnate).\n\nVibhishana was the youngest son of Kaikesi and Sage Vishrava, who was a son of Sage Pulatsya, one of the Heavenly Guardians. He (Vibhishana) was the younger brother of the Lord of Lanka, Ravana and Kumbakarna. Even though he was born in the demon race, he was alert and pious and considered himself a Brahmin, since his father was intuitively such.When kaikesi daughter of demon sumali expressed her wish to vishrava of becoming his wife,he said that you have asked for this wish in such inauspicious time that our children will be born with horrible body structure and cruel nature.Hearing this kaikesi fell at the Brahmin's foot and started crying.Seeing this vishrava said destiny cannot be changed but still seeing your devotion and as dutiful wife our youngest son will be born with normal body structure and pious mind but others will remain same.\n\nDue to Vibhishana's differences with Ravana, because he was against the act of kidnapping Sita and most of all because Ravana wanted the throne for himself, he fled Lanka. His mother, Kaikesi, advised him to go and serve Shri Rama, who was at that time assembling an army to conquer Ravana and to recover Sita. He divulged the secrets of Ravana's army and made sure Rama ended up being victorious in the great battle. Lord Rama accepted Vibhishana's service and anointed him the Lord of Lanka after Ravana's death.\n\nIn the Lanka War, Vibhishana's knowledge about the secrets of Lanka proved invaluable to Shri Rama. Vibhishana freely divulged many secrets that became key to the success of Rama's attack, including revealing the secret path to the temple of Mata Nikumbala, the family deity of the Pulatsya Clan. In the climactic battle between Rama and Ravana, when Rama was unable to kill Ravana, he revealed the secret of Ravana's death to Rama. He told Rama that Ravana has stored the nectar of immortality in his belly and it is necessary to dry it. Rama then finally killed Ravana. \nWhile modern readers tend to view the Indian epics with eyes used to seeing clearly defined good and bad characters, Ramayana's characterization is trying to represent the practical implications of the concept of Dharma. The epic stresses that neither Vibhishana or Kumbhakarna strayed from the path of Dharma and that there is no single way out of a moral dilemma. Ramayana teaches that Kumbhakarna adhered to the Dharma of loyalty to his kin when his advice fails, while Vibhishana chose to oppose his kin when his advice failed.\n\nSymbolically, Vibhishana represents a devotion to Shri Rama and as a demon devotee, he shows that the Lord does not distinguish between his followers based on birth or circumstances in life. The same aught can be read in the story of Prahlada and Narasimha.\n\nWhen Vibhishana attained the position of the King of Lanka, he turned his subjects from the path of evil to the path of Dharma (righteousness). His wife, Queen Sarama also aided him in this effort. He had a daughter named AnalTe.\n\nWhen Rama was about to leave Ayodhya at the end of his reign, Lord Rama in his original form of Shri Vishnu ordered Vibhishana to stay on earth and serve the people and guide them to the path of truth and Dharma. Hence, Vibhishana is considered one of the seven immortals or Chiranjeevins. Lord Vishnu also ordered Vibhishana to pray the family deity of Sun Dynasty, Lord Ranganatha.\n\nVibishana is attached with the legend of Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple, considered the abode of Vishnu on earth and the primary temple of Vishnu on earth. During the coronation of Rama, the avatar of Vishnu, Vibishana was presented the sacrosanct Sri Ranga Vimana. He was carrying it all the way to his kingdom of Sri Lanka and midway, to rest, he placed the image on the banks of Kaveri. After performing his routine pooja, he tried to lift the Vimana, but it could not be lifted. Mahavishnu appeared to him and said that he desired to stay as Ranganatha in the place, which went on to become Srirangam. Vishnu also desired to watch the Brahmotsavam at Tirucherai. The festivals of the temple are thus considered sacred.\n\nIn some period of history Sinhalese people have considered Vibhishana as one of the \"Sathara Waram Deviyo\" (four guardian deities). This belief was more prominent in the Kotte period. According to the \"Ravana Katha\" of Wickramasinghe Adigar, after the defeat of Ravana, Vibhishana transferred the Yaksha capital from Alaka mandawa to Kelaniya. In the 15th-century poem of Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera, the \"sælalihini sandesaya\", Myna is ordered to carry the missive to Vibhishana at his temple in Kelaniya. After the 16th century, he was replaced as a God of the four warrants by the goddess Pattini. He continues to be worshipped by a diminishing number of adherents, mainly in the Kelaniya area.\n"}

In 1967, he won the painting prize at the Biennale de Paris and presented his work \"Connaissez-vous Joseph Beuys ?\" at the Salon de Mai, in a reference to the man he considered the most important artist of the day. In 1969 he was invited by the critic and curator Harald Szeemann to take part in the now legendary show \"When Attitudes Become Form\". Teaching and the sharing of experience are key concerns of this artist. From 1980 to 1990 he was director of the Art Department at the École des Arts Décoratifs in Strasbourg, and from 1988 to 1995 he ran a seminar at the Institut des Hautes Etudes en Arts Plastiques created by Pontus Hulten.\nSince the 1980s, Sarkis has taken part in numerous international exhibitions (including Documenta and the biennials in Venice, Sydney, Istanbul and Moscow) and had his work shown in the world’s leading museums.\n\nIn the exhibition \"Passages\" at the Pompidou Centre in 2010, works by Sarkis were allowed to dialogue with works by Kasimir Malevich, the wall from André Breton’s studio, and \"Plight\" by Joseph Beuys, who is one of Sarkis’s sources of inspiration, along with the Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, one of whose films he explored in the Brancusi studio. \"Passages\" evoked both the permanent back-and-forth between an artist’s studio and the museum, and Walter Benjamin’s great unfinished work about the arcades of Paris. The exhibition featured a series of recent or specially created works produced by the Pompidou Centre. These works, standing as the artist’s \"KRIEGSSCHATZ\" (trophies), comprised found objects, art works and ethnographic objects from different civilizations.\n\nIn 2011 the Musée d’Art Moderne et Contemporain in Geneva (MAMCO) devoted an important retrospective to the artist entitled \"Hôtel Sarkis\". The presentation on four floors brought together 200 works created between 1971 and 2011, and explored the artist’s different practices (video and sound installations, watercolours, photographs, films) and thus amplified the resonance of a body of work produced in response to other artists, whether musicians, architects, writers, philosophers, painters, sculptors or filmmakers.\n\nIn 2012, Sarkis presented \"Ballads\" in the 5000 square metres of the underwater Hangars, at the invitation of the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen and the Port of Rotterdam, as well as \"Ailleurs, Ici\" on the estate of Chaumont-sur-Loire, following a commission by the regional council of Centre. He has also taken part in the group show \"La Triennale – Intense Proximité\" at the Palais de Tokyo with his \"Frise des Trésors de Guerre\", showed at \"Néon, who’s afraid of red, yellow and blue?\" at La Maison Rouge – Fondation Antoine de Galbert, and Istanbul Modern at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen.\n\nIn 2013, Sarkis took part in the exhibition \"When Attitudes Become Form, Bern 1969/Venice 2013\" at the Prada Foundation as part of the 55th Venice Biennale. He also showed at \"Passages Croisés en or\" at the Château d’Angers, and was invited to present his \"Frise de Guerre\" at the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Tasmania as part of the exhibition \"The Red Queen\". Sarkis also participated in the exhibition \"Ici, Ailleurs\" as part of the Marseille – Provence, European Capital of Culture programme, and the exhibition \"Modernity? Perspectives from France and Turkey\" at the Istanbul Modern, and in his solo exhibition titled \"Sarkis – Cage/Ryoanji Interpretation\" at the ARTER – Space for Art in Istanbul. \nIn 2014 he exhibited his \"Ring Portraits\" at the Huis Marseille Museum voor Fotografie in Amsterdam, and was presented in three places: the CIAC, the MNAC and the Museum of the Romanian Peasant in Bucharest.

She is the third daughter of the late Takakichi Asō, chairman of Asō Cement Co., and his wife, Kazuko, the daughter of former Prime Minister, Shigeru Yoshida. She is also the sister of former Prime Minister and current Deputy Prime Minister Tarō Asō. The couple married on 7 November 1980. Miss Asō was given the title HIH Princess Tomohito of Mikasa. The Prince and Princess had two daughters:\n\nThe family lived in a compound within the Akasaka Estate complex, in Azabu Minato, Tokyo. In October 2009, his wife separated her residence from him and their children.\n\nFor the 1972 Sapporo Winter Olympics, Prince Tomohito served as a committee member on the organizing committee from 1970 until 1972. He was also on the committee for the 1975 Okinawa World Fair.\n\nPrince Tomohito was president and honorary president of various organizations that concerned themselves with cancer research (the Princess Takamatsu Cancer Research Fund), having himself suffered from the disease from 2003, youth education and promotion of international relations. He was also noted for his support of organizations which promoted the welfare of people with physical or mental disabilities through sporting activities, such as ski, bowling, dancing and rugby.

His parents, Jonathan Mluwane Shabalala and Nomandla Elina Shabalala, raised Joseph and his six siblings on a white-owned farm called Tugela. His father died in the late 1940s; Joseph, being the eldest, had to take care of the family. He left the farm, however, in 1958 to search for work in the nearby city of Durban.\n\nDuring this time, he was spotted by a well-known group, the Durban Choir, after he delighted audiences with his smooth guitar playing and soprano voice. When he joined the choir, he attempted to teach them some of his new compositions, namely his first song \"Nomathemba\" (which was made into a play in 1995). They refused, and so he left them after only two years.\n\nIn 1958, Shabalala discovered an isicathamiya group, The Highlanders, led by his hero Galiyane Hlatshwayo. Hlatshwayo was the man who encouraged Shabalala to use his voice powerfully. Shabalala formed his own group the following year 1959, Ezimnyama (\"The Black Ones\"). A series of dreams he had in his sleep in December 1960 was a major turning point in the formation of the group; when he saw how well his group did in the once-weekly isicathamiya competitions, he renamed them Ladysmith Black Mambazo, \"Mambazo\" meaning axe, referring to how the group chopped down the other choirs by winning almost every time.\n\nAfter local radio airplay (on the S.A.B.C. station \"Radio Zulu\"), Shabalala accepted a recording contract that was offered in 1972 by Gallo Music producer West Nkosi. The group sold over 40,000 copies of their first album and continued to do so through other recordings. In 1976, he became a Christian, and the songs in the Mambazo repertoire were shuffled to one side to include generalized Christian, Methodist, and Zionist hymns sung in the Zulu language.\n\nIn 1986, Paul Simon travelled to South Africa to collaborate with South African artists for his upcoming \"Graceland\" album. Simon collaborated with Shabalala and the group, and co-composed the now-famous song, \"Homeless\". The group's popularity spread all over the world, and since then they have sold records popular enough to earn platinum disc certification. In 1987, the group won their first solo Grammy Award for \"Shaka Zulu\". Since then, they have won one more and have been nominated over ten times. Following the worldwide success of \"Graceland\", Shabalala began composing more songs in English (prior to this they had only recorded two in English and one in German).\n\nOn the night of 10 December 1991, his brother and fellow member Headman Shabalala was killed by an off-duty white security guard near the town of Ladysmith. The death was thought to be a racial murder. Joseph, helped by his beliefs, persevered, and the group continued; the members now included his brother Jockey, close relatives Albert and Abednego Mazibuko, Russel Mthembu and Jabulani Dubazana and his sons Sibongiseni, Thamsanqa, Thulani and Msizi. Nevertheless, tragedy returned. In May 2002, Shabalala's wife of 30 years, Nellie, was shot and killed by an assailant outside the couple's home in Clermont, KwaZulu-Natal. Shabalala's hand was wounded in his attempt to protect his wife. Mboneni Mdunge was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. At the same trial, Shabalala's son Nkosinathi Vivian Shabalala (Nellie's stepson) was charged, tried and acquitted on charges of having paid Mdunge for Nellie's murder.\n\nThe next album from the group, \"Wenyukela\", was expected to have a solemn touch to it. Indeed it did, including a tribute to Nellie by her grandsons Gagamela and Babuyile Shabalala, encouraging Shabalala to carry on and that \"S-H-A-B-A-L-A-L-A will live on.\" Six months after Nellie's death, he married Thoko Maduna, which was a \"controversial stunt,\" according to the South African press. Despite this opposition, Shabalala managed to continue to carry on singing and even managed to set up the Ladysmith Black Mambazo Foundation, a music academy to promote and teach isicathamiya music to young South African children.\n\nTragedy struck again in June 2004 when his brother and former Mambazo member Ben Shabalala was shot and killed by an unknown individual whilst driving his two children to school. In February 2006, his brother Jockey (his only brother in the group by this time), died of natural causes at his home in Ladysmith, South Africa.\n\nShabalala announced, in January 2008, that his youngest son Thamsanqa would take over as leader of Ladysmith Black Mambazo when the time comes for him to retire from international touring (see main article for more information).\n\nOn 11 February 2020, Shabalala died in Pretoria at the age of 78.\nAt his death, many media houses reported he was 78 years old which suggests he was born in 1941 but the government of South Africa declared his actual year of birth was 1940 which makes him 79 years old at the time of his death \n\n\n"}

The game was to be a real-time strategy game, with elements from first-person shooter games. According to Dave Taylor, the game's name came from Shakespeare's King Lear tragedy, wherein Golgotha was a massive plain and a future battlefield.\n\nThe game plays in the fictional future of the year 2048 AD, where a global nuclear disarmament and the coincidental murder of a beloved American archaeologist leads to an American military incision on Iraq. Which, in turn, elicits a European military power play and begins World War III. The commander of the American force sent to invade Iraq questions his mission. With no suitable answers, he abandons his country and takes his troops on the quest for truth. In the try to recover what really happened at Golgotha they discover a supernatural conflict behind a veil of political discord.\n\nAfter the successful release of \"Abuse\" in February 1996, \"Crack dot Com\" began instantly with a new project, called \"Golgotha\". The game was originally meant to be a real-time strategy game, with elements from first-person shooter games. This FPS/RTS hybrid should draw inspiration specifically from \"Doom\" and \"Command & Conquer\".\n\nThe last released demo, version number 5c, was playable in Windows. It supported both software rendering and 3dfx Glide-based 3D cards. The demo included two levels, one based on Switzerland and one based on Cairo. The Switzerland demo level was the more complete one. In addition to this, the demo also had a non-interactive demo level that showed the terrain rendering capabilities of the graphics engine.\n\nIn the demo, the gameplay worked in the following fashion. The player controlled a super-tank, which can be driven in first-person mode. In third-person mode, the player is presented with a bird's-eye view of the battlefield, and can command squads of individual units. The object of the level is to secure the enemy base and move any unit capable of taking over enemy bases to the \"takeover pad\" in the base.\n\nIn September 1998, around the time the company folded, the gameplay had several issues: Basically, there was no way to control squads any more; grand-scale strategy was limited to choosing path for the produced units to follow. This didn't allow for much variation in gameplay. Also, many AI issues had been left unattended.\n\nThough originally inspired by \"Command & Conquer\", the team decided to abandon the traditional RTS format because both the team and budget proved to be ill-suited to solving the problems inherent in an RTS. As they would learn later, pathsolving and routing are famous for bringing RTS teams to their knees and theirs was no exception. Rather than suffer, they decide to pull the kill chain on it and adopt a simpler gameplay mechanic.\n\nThe removal of squad control in \"Golgotha\" was intentional. Crack Dot Com tossed \"C&C\" as the inspiration and embraced \"Rescue Raiders\", changing it from a 1.5D RTS/action hybrid to a 2.5D RTS/action hybrid. In the new version of \"Golgotha\", players controlled a supertank in a very twitchy action game. So squad control was reduced to picking a path, then queuing a rock-paper-scissors-ish sequence of baddies so that players could quickly return to control of their supertank.\n\nThis change dramatically improved gameplay. Artificial intelligence for the opposing supertank was still wobbly and posed another notoriously challenging problem, but it was a far more tractable problem than the pathsolving/routing problem and a much better fit for the team. However, about the time the team had finally settled on this, they had burned through the cash generated from sales of \"Abuse\", in addition to a little money from AMD for 3DNow! optimizations and a gracious gift from Richard Garriott. Although they had an offer on the table to fund the rest of the game, Dave Taylor was at the time too proud to let someone else foot the bill, thinking that they would ruin it. In retrospect, he believes he should have coped and accepted the money. Crack Dot Com released the assets to the public domain so they could ride the resulting press release to other jobs.\n\nThe unfinished game's assets were released to public domain on October 22, 2000. This included source code, game data, textures and music, some of which have been recycled into other games.\n\nAfter the release, some volunteers started working on the game code. The development effort was rekindled as \"Golgotha Forever\", headed by Mark O'Hara. However, the interest later died down.\n\n"}

The current incumbent is Art O'Leary who was appointed in June 2014. \n\nThe Office was established by the \"Presidential Establishment Act, 1938\". Under this Act, and subsequent legislation, the Secretary General is:\n\nThe Secretary General's signature is essential for the authentication of the Presidential Seal when affixed to a document executed by the Commission under Seal.\n\nUnder the \"Presidential Elections (Amendment) Act, 1946\" the Secretary General to the President is one of a group of senior state officials, including the outgoing president, the Taoiseach and the chairs of both houses of the Oireachtas, who must be formally notified of the election of a new president by the Returning Officer.\n\nThe coming into force of the new Irish constitution, in December 1937 resulted in the creation of a new office, President of Ireland. While the office was not scheduled to be filled until mid 1938 its powers, functions and duties were required to be exercised immediately. That role was given to the new collective vice-presidency, which under the transitory provisions of the constitution was made up of the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann, the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court. (The latter fulfilled the role that would normally be exercised by the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann. However the election to the new upper house had yet to take place, so there was no Cathaoirleach.) \n\nThe Government immediately appointed as Secretary to the President, as the post was then called, Michael McDunphy, a controversial, outspoken and temperamental civil servant who had prior to his appointment been Assistant Secretary to the Executive Council, and had once been Secretary to the Provisional Governments of Michael Collins and W. T. Cosgrave (January–December 1922) McDunphy, like the Presidential Commission, was originally based in Dublin Castle until a new presidential residence was chosen. He moved into the new Áras an Uachtaráin (formerly the Viceregal Lodge) in June 1938.\n\nMcDunphy proved to be a difficult and complex Secretary to the President. A passionate believer in structure, he spent his period in office creating numerous rules and regulations. While the first president, the politically inexperienced Douglas Hyde accepted his rules automatically, his successor, the more politically experienced former Tánaiste, Seán T. O'Kelly, who became president in June 1945, had a more fraught relationship with McDunphy and frequently baulked at following McDunphy's rules. \n\nMcDunphy had a long-term impact on the presidency. His 1945 book \"The President of Ireland: His Powers, Functions & Duties\" was seen as the bible of the office by those seeking to restrict the post and its occupant. His restrictions, which were viewed as correct (or, if not correct, useful in enabling them to control and restrict presidents) by later civil servants, led President Erskine Childers to accuse one later Secretary to the President of having \"the ghost of McDunphy behind you.\" Mary Robinson as president ditched all of McDunphy's rules and in effect started from scratch. Commentators credited the ditching of McDunphy's rules as a key factor in the rebirth of the office and in its subsequent popularity.\n\nThough technically the Secretary General to the President is attached to the Department of the Taoiseach in practice he or she is treated as being a full department head in his or her own right. McDunphy however accused the Secretary to the Government and Secretary to the Taoiseach, Maurice Moynihan of plotting to undermine him and take over control of the Office of the President, a claim Moynihan ridiculed in papers now available in the National Archives of Ireland.\n\nIn the 1990s, the title of chief civil servant in the Irish government was changed from \"Secretary to the Department\" to \"Secretary-General to the Department\". The post of \"Secretary to the President\" however was left unchanged because the Office of the President was not technically a department. In 2004 a Bill was introduced into the Oireachtas to change the title from \"Secretary to the President\" to \"Secretary-General to the President\". The name change came into force in 2005.\n\n"}
{"id": "2075960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2075960", "title": "Ferroelectric RAM", "text": "Ferroelectric RAM\n\nFerroelectric RAM (FeRAM, F-RAM or FRAM) is a random-access memory similar in construction to DRAM but using a ferroelectric layer instead of a dielectric layer to achieve non-volatility. FeRAM is one of a growing number of alternative non-volatile random-access memory technologies that offer the same functionality as flash memory.\n\nFeRAM's advantages over Flash include: lower power usage, faster write performance and a much greater maximum read/write endurance (about 10 to 10 cycles). FeRAMs have data retention times of more than 10 years at +85 °C (up to many decades at lower temperatures).\nMarket disadvantages of FeRAM are much lower storage densities than flash devices, storage capacity limitations and higher cost. Like DRAM, FeRAM's read process is destructive, necessitating a write-after-read architecture.\n\nFerroelectric RAM was proposed by MIT graduate student Dudley Allen Buck in his master's thesis, \"Ferroelectrics for Digital Information Storage and Switching,\" published in 1952. This was during an era of sharing research between members of the scientific community as a means to rapidly propel technological innovation during a rapid buildup of computing power in the Cold War era. In 1955, Bell Telephone Laboratories was experimenting with ferroelectric-crystal memories. Following the introduction of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips in the early 1970s, development of FeRAM began in the late 1980s. Work was done in 1991 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on improving methods of read out, including a novel method of non-destructive readout using pulses of UV radiation.\n\nFeRAM was commercialized in the late 1990s. In 1996, Samsung Electronics introduced a 4Mb FeRAM chip fabricated using NMOS logic. In 1998, Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix) also commercialized FeRAM technology. The earliest known commercial product to use FeRAM is Sony's PlayStation 2 (PS2), released in 2000. The PS2 hardware's Emotion Engine central processing unit (CPU) manufactured by Toshiba contains 32kb embedded FeRAM fabricated using a 500 nm complementary MOS (CMOS) process.\n\nA major modern FeRAM manufacturer is Ramtron, a fabless semiconductor company. One major licensee is Fujitsu, who operates what is probably the largest semiconductor foundry production line with FeRAM capability. Since 1999 they have been using this line to produce standalone FeRAMs, as well as specialized chips (e.g. chips for smart cards) with embedded FeRAMs. Fujitsu produced devices for Ramtron until 2010. Since 2010 Ramtron's fabricators have been TI (Texas Instruments) and IBM. Since at least 2001 Texas Instruments has collaborated with Ramtron to develop FeRAM test chips in a modified 130 nm process. In the fall of 2005, Ramtron reported that they were evaluating prototype samples of an 8-megabit FeRAM manufactured using Texas Instruments' FeRAM process. Fujitsu and Seiko-Epson were in 2005 collaborating in the development of a 180 nm FeRAM process. In 2012 Ramtron was acquired by Cypress Semiconductor.\nFeRAM research projects have also been reported at Samsung, Matsushita, Oki, Toshiba, Infineon, Hynix, Symetrix, Cambridge University, University of Toronto, and the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC, Belgium).\n\nConventional DRAM consists of a grid of small capacitors and their associated wiring and signaling transistors. Each storage element, a \"cell\", consists of one capacitor and one transistor, a so-called \"1T-1C\" device. It is typically a type of MOS memory, fabricated using CMOS technology. DRAM cells scale directly with the size of the semiconductor fabrication process being used to make it. For instance, on the 90 nm process used by most memory providers to make DDR2 DRAM, the cell size is 0.22 μm², which includes the capacitor, transistor, wiring, and some amount of \"blank space\" between the various parts — it appears 35% utilization is typical, leaving 65% of the space empty (for separation).\n\nDRAM data is stored as the presence or lack of an electrical charge in the capacitor, with the lack of charge in general representing \"0\". Writing is accomplished by activating the associated control transistor, draining the cell to write a \"0\", or sending current into it from a supply line if the new value should be \"1\". Reading is similar in nature; the transistor is again activated, draining the charge to a \"sense amplifier\". If a pulse of charge is noticed in the amplifier, the cell held a charge and thus reads \"1\"; the lack of such a pulse indicates a \"0\". Note that this process is \"destructive\", once the cell has been read. If it did hold a \"1,\" it must be re-charged to that value again. Since a cell loses its charge after some time due to leak currents, it must be actively refreshed at intervals.\n\nThe 1T-1C storage cell design in an FeRAM is similar in construction to the storage cell in widely used DRAM in that both cell types include one capacitor and one access transistor. In a DRAM cell capacitor, a linear dielectric is used, whereas in an FeRAM cell capacitor the dielectric structure includes ferroelectric material, typically lead zirconate titanate (PZT).\n\nA ferroelectric material has a nonlinear relationship between the applied electric field and the apparent stored charge. Specifically, the ferroelectric characteristic has the form of a hysteresis loop, which is very similar in shape to the hysteresis loop of ferromagnetic materials. The dielectric constant of a ferroelectric is typically much higher than that of a linear dielectric because of the effects of semi-permanent electric dipoles formed in the crystal structure of the ferroelectric material. When an external electric field is applied across a dielectric, the dipoles tend to align themselves with the field direction, produced by small shifts in the positions of atoms and shifts in the distributions of electronic charge in the crystal structure. After the charge is removed, the dipoles retain their polarization state. Binary \"0\"s and \"1\"s are stored as one of two possible electric polarizations in each data storage cell. For example, in the figure a \"1\" is encoded using the negative remnant polarization \"-Pr\", and a \"0\" is encoded using the positive remnant polarization \"+Pr\".\n\nIn terms of operation, FeRAM is similar to DRAM. Writing is accomplished by applying a field across the ferroelectric layer by charging the plates on either side of it, forcing the atoms inside into the \"up\" or \"down\" orientation (depending on the polarity of the charge), thereby storing a \"1\" or \"0\". Reading, however, is somewhat different than in DRAM. The transistor forces the cell into a particular state, say \"0\". If the cell already held a \"0\", nothing will happen in the output lines. If the cell held a \"1\", the re-orientation of the atoms in the film will cause a brief pulse of current in the output as they push electrons out of the metal on the \"down\" side. The presence of this pulse means the cell held a \"1\". Since this process overwrites the cell, reading FeRAM is a destructive process, and requires the cell to be re-written.\n\nIn general, the operation of FeRAM is similar to ferrite core memory, one of the primary forms of computer memory in the 1960s. However, compared to core memory, FeRAM requires far less power to flip the state of the polarity and does so much faster.\n\nThe main determinant of a memory system's cost is the density of the components used to make it up. Smaller components, and fewer of them, means that more cells can be packed onto a single chip, which in turn means more can be produced at once from a single silicon wafer. This improves yield, which is directly related to cost.\n\nThe lower limit to this scaling process is an important point of comparison. In general, the technology that scales to the smallest cell size will end up being the least expensive per bit. In terms of construction, FeRAM and DRAM are similar, and can in general be built on similar lines at similar sizes. In both cases, the lower limit seems to be defined by the amount of charge needed to trigger the sense amplifiers. For DRAM, this appears to be a problem at around 55 nm, at which point the charge stored in the capacitor is too small to be detected. It is not clear as to whether FeRAM can scale to the same size, as the charge density of the PZT layer may not be the same as the metal plates in a normal capacitor.\n\nAn additional limitation on size is that materials tend to stop being ferroelectric when they are too small. (This effect is related to the ferroelectric's \"depolarization field\".) There is ongoing research on addressing the problem of stabilizing ferroelectric materials; one approach, for example, uses molecular adsorbates.\n\nTo date, the commercial FeRAM devices have been produced at 350 nm and 130 nm. Early models required two FeRAM cells per bit, leading to very low densities, but this limitation has since been removed.\n\nThe key advantage to FeRAM over DRAM is what happens \"between\" the read and write cycles. In DRAM, the charge deposited on the metal plates leaks across the insulating layer and the control transistor, and disappears. In order for a DRAM to store data for anything other than a very short time, every cell must be periodically read and then re-written, a process known as \"refresh\". Each cell must be refreshed many times every second (typically 1000/64 round 0 times per second) and this requires a continuous supply of power.\n\nIn contrast, FeRAM only requires power when actually reading or writing a cell. The vast majority of power used in DRAM is used for refresh, so it seems reasonable to suggest that the benchmark quoted by STT-MRAM researchers is useful here too, indicating power usage about 99% lower than DRAM. The destructive read aspect of FeRAM may put it at a disadvantage compared to MRAM, however.\n\nAnother non-volatile memory type is flash RAM, and like FeRAM it does not require a refresh process. Flash works by pushing electrons across a high-quality insulating barrier where they get \"stuck\" on one terminal of a transistor. This process requires high voltages, which are built up in a charge pump over time. This means that FeRAM could be expected to be lower power than flash, at least for writing, as the write power in FeRAM is only marginally higher than reading. For a \"mostly-read\" device the difference might be slight, but for devices with more balanced read and write the difference could be expected to be much higher.\n\nDRAM performance is limited by the rate at which the charge stored in the cells can be drained (for reading) or stored (for writing). In general, this ends up being defined by the capability of the control transistors, the capacitance of the lines carrying power to the cells, and the heat that power generates.\n\nFeRAM is based on the physical movement of atoms in response to an external field, which happens to be extremely fast, settling in about 1 ns. In theory, this means that FeRAM could be much faster than DRAM. However, since power has to flow into the cell for reading and writing, the electrical and switching delays would likely be similar to DRAM overall. It does seem reasonable to suggest that FeRAM would require less charge than DRAM, because DRAMs need to \"hold\" the charge, whereas FeRAM would have been written to before the charge would have drained. However, there is a delay in writing because the charge has to flow through the control transistor, which limits current somewhat.\n\nIn comparison to flash, the advantages are much more obvious. Whereas the read operation is likely to be similar in performance, the charge pump used for writing requires a considerable time to \"build up\" current, a process that FeRAM does not need. Flash memories commonly need a millisecond or more to complete a write, whereas current FeRAMs may complete a write in less than 150 ns.\n\nOn the other hand, FeRAM has its own reliability issues, including imprint and fatigue. Imprint is the preferential polarization state from previous writes to that state, and fatigue is increase of minimum writing voltage due to loss of polarization after extensive cycling.\n\nThe theoretical performance of FeRAM is not entirely clear. Existing 350 nm devices have read times on the order of 50–60 ns. Although slow compared to modern DRAMs, which can be found with times on the order of 2 ns, common 350 nm DRAMs operated with a read time of about 35 ns, so FeRAM performance appears to be comparable given the same fabrication technology.\n\nFeRAM remains a relatively small part of the overall semiconductor market. In 2005, worldwide semiconductor sales were US$235 billion (according to the Gartner Group), with the flash memory market accounting for US $18.6 billion (according to IC Insights). The 2005 annual sales of Ramtron, perhaps the largest FeRAM vendor, were reported to be US $32.7 million. The much larger sales of flash memory compared to the alternative NVRAMs support a much larger research and development effort. Flash memory is produced using semiconductor linewidths of 30 nm at Samsung (2007) while FeRAMs are produced in linewidths of 350 nm at Fujitsu and 130 nm at Texas Instruments (2007). Flash memory cells can store multiple bits per cell (currently 3 in the highest density NAND flash devices), and the number of bits per flash cell is projected to increase to 4 or even to 8 as a result of innovations in flash cell design. As a consequence, the areal bit densities of flash memory are much higher than those of FeRAM, and thus the cost per bit of flash memory is orders of magnitude lower than that of FeRAM.\n\nThe density of FeRAM arrays might be increased by improvements in FeRAM foundry process technology and cell structures, such as the development of vertical capacitor structures (in the same way as DRAM) to reduce the area of the cell footprint. However, reducing the cell size may cause the data signal to become too weak to be detectable. In 2005, Ramtron reported significant sales of its FeRAM products in a variety of sectors including (but not limited to) electricity meters, automotive (e.g. black boxes, smart air bags), business machines (e.g. printers, RAID disk controllers), instrumentation, medical equipment, industrial microcontrollers, and radio frequency identification tags. The other emerging NVRAMs, such as MRAM, may seek to enter similar niche markets in competition with FeRAM.\n\nTexas Instruments proved it to be possible to embed FeRAM cells using two additional masking steps during conventional CMOS semiconductor manufacture. Flash typically requires nine masks. This makes possible for example, the integration of FeRAM onto microcontrollers, where a simplified process would reduce costs. However, the materials used to make FeRAMs are not commonly used in CMOS integrated circuit manufacturing. Both the PZT ferroelectric layer and the noble metals used for electrodes raise CMOS process compatibility and contamination issues. Texas Instruments has incorporated an amount of FRAM memory into its MSP430 microcontrollers in its new FRAM series.\n\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Hanshin Tigers (2007–2008) and Orix Buffaloes (2009). He stands tall and weighs .\n\nHis career was revitalized with the Giants in 2011. He made the 2011 All-Star team, and in 2012 he posted a streak of 16 consecutive quality starts, allowing three earned runs or fewer in at least six innings each game. In four starts during the 2012 postseason, he recorded a 3–0 record with a 1.09 ERA, twice helping the Giants avoid elimination en route to their 2012 World Series title. In 2014, Vogelsong made a career-high 32 starts, helping the Giants win another title in the 2014 World Series.\n\nIn 1995, Vogelsong graduated from Octorara Area High school in Atglen, Pennsylvania, where he played baseball, basketball, and soccer. He played Legion baseball in Oxford, Pennsylvania. He played his little league baseball for Highland in the Southern Chester County Midget League. He also played for Kutztown University in Kutztown, Pennsylvania, during the 1996–1998 seasons. He recorded 242 strikeouts and set nine school records in his three years at Kutztown. He was inducted into the university's Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nVogelsong was drafted by the Giants in the 5th round of the 1998 MLB draft. In 1998 he made his minor league debut with the Single A Salem-Keizer Volcanoes in Keizer, Oregon.\n\nVogelsong made his MLB debut with the Giants on September 2, 2000. He finished the rest of the 2000 season by playing 4 games with 6 innings in relief pitched.\n\nVogelsong did not perform well to start the 2001 season as he went 0–5 and a 6.75 ERA in 15 games (2 started).\n\nVogelsong was acquired by the Pirates on July 30, 2001, along with outfielder Armando Ríos, for pitcher Jason Schmidt and outfielder John Vander Wal. He appeared in two games for the Pirates before he required Tommy John surgery that kept him out of the majors until the end of the 2003 season.\n\n2004 marked Vogelsong's first full season in the major leagues. He spent most of the season as a starting pitcher. Vogelsong struggled in that role, ending the season with a 6–13 record and 6.50 ERA. He rebounded in 2005 after being moved to the bullpen, posting a 4.43 ERA and 2–2 record while being used primarily as a middle reliever. At the end of the 2006 season, Vogelsong had accumulated a career 10–22 record and a 5.86 ERA in 120 games and 315 innings over parts of six seasons.\n\nVogelsong signed for the Hanshin Tigers of the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in 2007 and made his Nippon Professional Baseball debut as their starting pitcher on April 5, 2007, facing a future Major League Baseball pitcher, Kenshin Kawakami. He won in his debut at the home stadium, Koshien Stadium, on April 12, 2007, hitting a home run in the bottom of the second inning.\n\nVogelsong signed a one-year deal to play for the Orix Buffaloes of the NPB in 2009.\n\nDuring the 2009–2010 off-season, Vogelsong made his way back to the MLB and signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. He appeared in 25 games for the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs, posting a 2–5 record with a 4.91 ERA in 58.2 innings. He was released by the Phillies on July 15, 2010.\n\nVogelsong signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 28, 2010. Vogelsong appeared in eight games for the AAA Salt Lake Bees, posting a 1–3 record with a 4.66 ERA in 36.2 innings pitched. He was released after the season ended.\n\nIn 2011, Vogelsong signed a minor league contract to return to the San Francisco Giants with an invitation to spring training. He started the season in AAA Fresno, but on April 17, 2011, the Giants purchased his contract to replace the injured Barry Zito. On April 28, 2011, after making two relief appearances, Vogelsong got his first start since the 2004 season against his former club, the Pirates. He held the host Pirates to two earned runs on four hits and struck out eight en route to a 5–2 Giants victory and his first MLB win since September 2005.\n\nVogelsong continued to excel in his replacement role, posting a record of 6–1 with a 2.17 ERA in the first half, which secured him a spot in San Francisco's vaunted starting rotation. Giants and 2011 National League All-Star manager Bruce Bochy named Vogelsong to the 2011 NL All-Star Team on July 3, 2011. He didn't see any action in the NL 5–1 win over the AL. His first start after the All-Star break on July 18, 2011, a 5–0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, gave him enough innings pitched to qualify for the National League leader in ERA with 2.02.\n\nIn his final start of the season Vogelsong pitched seven shutout innings against the Colorado Rockies, giving up four hits and walking no batters. The 33-year-old Vogelsong finished his first MLB season as a starting pitcher since 2005 with a 13–7 record and a 2.71 ERA, the lowest among the San Francisco starting rotation that boasted Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, and Madison Bumgarner. Five of Vogelsong's seven losses occurred in a row, during a stretch where Vogelsong received three total runs of support, with no more than one run scored each game by a struggling San Francisco offense.\n\nDuring the month of August 2011, Vogelsong stated that playing winter ball in Venezuela in 2010 with Tiburones de La Guaira was the turning point to recover his career. Prior to his experience in Venezuela, Vogelsong had 10 wins, 22 losses and 5.86 ERA in his MLB career\n\nIn January, Vogelsong and the Giants agreed to an $8.3 million, two-year contract.\n\nVogelsong continued to dominate in 2012. He boasted the lowest ERA in the National League at the All-Star Break and a 7–4 record. Despite his impressive pitching, Vogelsong did not make the 2012 All-Star team, a decision Giants fans consider a major snub. Vogelsong was the first ERA leader not to make the All-Star team since 2001 (Josh Johnson had not pitched enough innings in 2006 to qualify for the ERA title). On August 3, 2012, Vogelsong's 16-game streak of allowing three or fewer runs per game was snapped by the Colorado Rockies when he allowed 4 runs while pitching 6.1 innings in a 16–4 Giants win. Vogelsong finished the regular season with a 14–9 record in 31 starts with a 3.37 ERA.\n\nIn the 2012 postseason, Vogelsong would play a pivotal role in the Giants push toward their 2012 World Series title. During Game 3 of the 2012 National League Division Series in Cincinnati, with the Reds holding a commanding 2–0 lead in the series and the Giants facing elimination, Vogelsong pitched a tight game tied at one run through 5 innings. The Giants would go on to win Game 3, 2–1 in 10 innings on a Joaquin Arias ground ball mishandled by Scott Rolen allowing Buster Posey to score the winning run. During Game 2 of the 2012 National League Championship Series in San Francisco, Vogelsong faced Chris Carpenter, with the Cardinals holding a 1–0 series lead. Vogelsong allowed 1 run in the 2nd inning to tie the game, but proceeded to shut out the Cardinals offense through seven innings en route to a 7–1 win at home to tie the series at one game apiece. During Game 6 of the NLCS in San Francisco, Vogelsong and the Giants faced elimination for a fifth time. Giants' pitching had begun to dominate. Vogelsong had a very strong outing this time, scattering five hits and allowing one run (in the 6th inning), after the Giants set the tempo with a four-run 2nd inning to break the game open. He set a new career-high of 9 strikeouts on the night after he struck out Daniel Descalso with a foul tip. The Giants won 6–1, pushing the NLCS to the limit in a magical Game 7, which they won to complete the comeback and advance to the World Series.\n\nDuring Game 3 of the 2012 World Series in Detroit, the Giants held a surprising 2–0 lead for the first time in the 2012 postseason. Vogelsong again had a strong outing, posting a shutout through 5.2 innings. The Tigers threatened to open the scoring with the bases loaded and one out in the 5th inning, but Vogelsong struck out Quintin Berry and got Miguel Cabrera to pop out to end the threat. The Giants would go on to win Game 3, 2–0, and posted the first back-to-back shutouts since 1966. The Giants went on to sweep the Detroit Tigers 4–0 to win the World Series.\n\nVogelsong and Barry Zito were the only pitchers to go undefeated in the postseason amongst all Giants' starting pitchers. Vogelsong posted a 3–0 record with a 1.09 ERA, allowing three runs through 24.2 innings, the lowest ERA among all Giants' starting pitchers. Vogelsong's postseason ERA was the best since Orel Hershiser's 1.05 in 1988 (minimum 24 innings). Vogelsong joined Christy Mathewson as the only pitchers to start their postseason careers with four consecutive starts of five or more innings giving up one run or fewer.\n\nVogelsong began 2013 as the #5 starter in the Giants rotation. His season didn't start out well, where in his first 9 starts, he went 2–4 with a 7.19 ERA and 1 quality start. In a start on May 20 against the Nationals, he was pitching 5 shutout innings when he came to bat against Craig Stammen, who hit him on the hand with a fastball, fracturing two bones and dislocating a joint. Vogelsong missed almost 12 weeks before returning on August 9. He had a strong final two months, lowering his ERA by 1.46. In 19 starts in 2013, Vogelsong went 4–6 with a 5.73 ERA, striking out 67 in 103.2 innings.\n\nOn November 4, Vogelsong had his $6.5 million club option declined, and instead was paid a $300,000 buyout. However, the Giants remained interested in negotiating a less-expensive deal with him. Vogelsong agreed to a 1-year, $5 million contract on November 29, 2013, pending the completion of a physical examination. The deal was officially completed on December 4, 2013.\n\nVogelsong made a career-high 32 starts in 2014, finishing the season 8–13 with a 4.00 ERA, striking out 151 in 184.2 innings. During the postseason, Vogelsong started three games, and although he received three no decisions, the Giants went on to win each game. Vogelsong won his second World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals four games to three.\n\nOn January 23, 2015, Vogelsong re-signed with the Giants on a one-year, $4 million contract. On September 3, he hit his first career home run, a 2-run homer off Chris Rusin at Coors Field.\n\nOn December 18, 2015, Vogelsong signed a one-year contract to return to the Pirates for the 2016 season. On May 23, 2016, Vogelsong was hit in the face by a pitch from Colorado Rockies right-hander Jordan Lyles. He suffered damage to his left eye socket, including fractures to the orbital bone. He was subsequently placed on the 15-day disabled list.\n\nOn January 10, 2017, Vogelsong agreed to a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins, with an invite to spring training. He was released on March 21, 2017 after he struggled to a 7.72 ERA in just 8 innings of spring work.\nThe Giants held a ceremony on September 17, 2017, before the game at AT&T Park, to officially retire Vogelsong as a Giant.\n\nVogelsong throws a four-seam fastball, two-seam fastball, cut fastball, circle changeup, and curveball. His four seam sits in 90–93 mph.\n\n\nVogelsong is married to Nicole Vogelsong, with whom he has one son, Ryder. Vogelsong is a Christian.\n"}

It encompasses and is the only national forest located in the Florida Panhandle. The National Forest provides water and land-based outdoors activities such as off-road biking, hiking, swimming, boating, hunting, fishing, horse-back riding, and off-road ATV usage.\n\nApalachicola National Forest contains two Wilderness Areas: Bradwell Bay Wilderness and Mud Swamp/New River Wilderness. There are also several special purpose areas: Camel Lake Recreation Area, Fort Gadsden Historical Site, Leon Sinks Geological Area, Silver Lake Recreation Area, Trout Pond Recreation Area, and Wright Lake Recreation Area. In descending order of forest land area it is located in parts of Liberty, Wakulla, Leon, and Franklin counties. The forest is headquartered in Tallahassee, as are all three National Forests in Florida, but there are local Forest ranger district offices located in Bristol and Crawfordville.\n\nHunting and fishing are monitored and governed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The national forest itself is a wildlife management area. The FWC divides the management area into sections that allow dog hunting, still hunting, and private property. Modern gun season for large game starts Thanksgiving weekend and ends in January.\n\nThe Apalachicola National Forest is in the southeastern conifer forests ecoregion. Areas of the national forest with dry, sandy soils support Florida longleaf pine sandhills and east Gulf coastal plain near-coast pine flatwoods. Sandhills are woodlands dominated by longleaf pine (\"Pinus palustris\"). Pine flatwoods are forests and woodlands on broad, sandy flatlands. Both of these pine communities are sustained by frequent fires.\n\nNear the floodplains of spring-fed rivers grow southern coastal plain hydric hammocks, dense forests of evergreen and deciduous hardwood trees. Blackwater rivers support southern coastal plain blackwater river floodplain forests of baldcypress (\"Taxodium distichum\") along their banks. Major rivers support diverse east Gulf coastal plain large river floodplain forests.\n\nNotable animals that inhabit this forest are red-cockaded woodpecker, fox squirrel, red fox, raccoon, gray fox, bobcat, coyote, black bear, wild turkey and alligator. \n\nIt is also home to several wetland plant communities. Southern coastal plain nonriverine basin swamps are large, seasonally flooded depressions of baldcypress (\"Taxodium distichum\") and swamp tupelo (\"Nyssa biflora\"). East Gulf coastal plain savannas and wet prairies are low, flat plains covered in grasses and sedges, which are seasonally flooded and maintained by frequent fires. Southern coastal plain nonriverine cypress domes are small wetlands of pond cypress (\"Taxodium ascendens\") notable for their dome-shaped appearance.\n\nThe Forest contains thousands of acres of old growth Pond Cypress swamps (cypress domes). In addition, Bradwell Bay Wilderness contains about of old-growth Slash Pine - Swamp Tupelo swamps.\n\n\n"}

It is present in 90 countries, operating in several sectors, including retail, financial services, shopping centres management, software and information systems, media and telecommunications.\n\nIt is the largest private employer in Portugal, with 53,794 employees.\n\nSonae is listed on the Euronext PSI-20 in Lisbon, under the code SON.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Sonae's turnover amounted to 2,680 million euros, with net results in the order of 98 million euros, more 34.2% than the same period last year.\n\nSonae was founded in 1959 by the entrepreneur, banker and patron from Arouca, Afonso Pinto de Magalhães. The business group originated from the Sociedade Nacional de Estratificados, an industrial company operating in the area of processed wood, more specifically, in the production of decorative high-pressure laminated panels. During the first two decades of existence, Sonae remained as a small to medium-size business company.\n\nAfonso Pinto de Magalhães, also the founder of the Pinto Magalhães Bank, placed Fábio Lemos in control of Sonae in the turbulent years following the Carnation Revolution. During that period, the company was nationalized and then reprivatized.\n\nIn 1982, Afonso Pinto de Magalhães gave 16% of Sonae to Belmiro de Azevedo, who had been admitted to Sonae in 1965. After the death of the founder, Belmiro de Azevedo reached the majority of the capital, with 54.6%, taking control of the company.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Sonae began its fast growth. In 1985, Sonae Investimentos SGPS, S.A. was created and the group entered the Lisbon Stock Exchange. It was also in the early 1980s that Sonae began its business diversification strategy through acquisitions and the creation of new investments.\n\nThe group entered into the modern distribution market by opening the first hypermarket in Portugal, \"Continente\", in Matosinhos. Two years later, Sonae launched seven takeover bids to seven companies, which allowed the business group to grow in various business areas.\n\nIn 1993, Sonae Indústria expanded its investments by acquiring a controlling position in Spanish company Tafisa, which allowed the company to extend its business segment. Posteriorly, another important step was taken when Sonae entered into the specialized retail area with the launch of Worten.\n\nIn 1998, with Paulo de Azevedo leading the project, Optimus was born. The mobile operator merged with Zon in 2013, giving rise to NOS.\n\nIn 2007, Paulo de Azevedo took over the leadership of the Sonae group, succeeding his father, Belmiro de Azevedo.\n\nIn March 2015, Belmiro de Azevedo announced his resignation as Sonae chairman. Paulo de Azevedo was chosen as the new chairman and CEO of the Sonae group, sharing the executive committee presidency with Ângelo Paupério, who was the vice president of Sonae until that point.\n\nIn 2018, Cláudia Azevedo was elected executive president of Sonae by the biggest shareholder company of the group, the Efanor. Belmiro de Azevedo's daughter started functions in May 2019, replacing the group Co-CEOs, Paulo de Azevedo and Ângelo Paupério.\n\nFrom 2009, Sonae (Sonae SGPS, S.A.) holds a portfolio of businesses grouped into different business areas, where its subholdings are included:\n\nCore Businesses\n\nCore Partnerships\n\nRelated Business\n\nActive Investments\n\nWith autonomy since 2007, there is Sonae Capital, presided by Cláudia Azevedo, daughter of Belmiro de Azevedo, with three main business areas:\n\n\nIn 2012, Sonae invested more than 70 million Euros in research in the retail sector, in a programme that involved around 3,200 employees. In 2014, Sonae compiled a book with more than 80 innovations developed during 2013, in areas like Health or Technology, many of them with national and international prizes.\n\nIn 2013, Sonae gave back to the community 10.6 million Euros of which 5 million were in foodstuffs donations, impacting more than 2,000 institutions. \nThe main intervention areas are: Environmental Awareness, Culture, Education, Health and Sports, Science and Innovation (R&D) and Social Solidarity.\n\nSonae has received awards and distinctions in a number of areas, having been recognised as one of the Most Ethical Companies in the world, as Human Capital Master and with the ICSC Solal Marketing Awards. According to the latest edition of the Global Powers of Retailing report, carried out by Deloitte and the American magazine Stores, Sonae is one of the 250 largest retailers in the world, positioning itself at 155 place, which is equivalent to an increase of 10 places from the previous ranking. In 2015, Sonae's major retail brands were distinguished as \"Trusted Brands\", according to the international study carried out for the 15th consecutive year by the Reader's Digest Selections. It is the second most desired company to work by Portuguese university students, according to a survey conducted by Spark Agency and Economics and Management School at Minho University. The company was recognized by Kaizen Institute for its continuous improvement. Continente was honoured with the title \"Kaizen Ambassador\", for its work carried out in store operations, and Worten was the winner in the \"Excellence in Quality\" category, for its sales force management project.\n\nSonae brands (Continente, Worten, Sport Zone, Wells and Zippy) were the most valued by consumers, in the fourth edition of Consumer Choice Awards.\n\n8.ª Avenida | AlbufeiraShopping | AlgarveShopping | Arrabidashopping | Cascaishopping | CC Continente de Portimão | Centro Colombo | Centro Vasco da Gama | CoimbraShopping | Estação Viana Shopping | GaiaShopping | Guimarães Shopping | LeiriaShopping | LoureShopping | Madeira Shopping | MaiaShopping | Norteshopping | Parque Atlântico | RioSul Shopping | Serra Shopping | Via Catarina\n\nBoavista Shopping | Boulevard Londrina Shopping | Franca Shopping | Manauara Shopping | Parque D.

{"id": "2076005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076005", "title": "Corey–House synthesis", "text": "Corey–House synthesis\n\nThe Corey–House synthesis (also called the Corey–Posner–Whitesides–House reaction and other permutations) is an organic reaction that involves the reaction of a lithium diorganylcuprate (RCuLi) with an organyl (pseudo)halide (R'X) to form a new alkane, as well as an ill-defined organocopper species and lithium halide as byproducts. \n\nIn principle, a carbanion equivalent such as an organolithium or Grignard reagent can react directly (without copper) with an alkyl halide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to form a new carbon–carbon bond. However, aside from the use of metal acetylides as nucleophiles, such a process rarely works well in practice due to metal–halogen exchange and/or the formation of large amounts of reduction or elimination side-products. As a solution to this problem, the Corey–House reaction constitutes a general and high yielding method for the joining of two alkyl groups or an alkyl group and an aryl group. \n\nThe scope of the Corey-House synthesis is exceptionally broad, and a range of lithium diorganylcuprates (RCuLi, R = 1°, 2°, or 3° alkyl, aryl, or alkenyl) and organyl (pseudo) halides (RX, R = methyl, benzylic, allylic, 1°, or cyclic 2° alkyl, aryl, or alkenyl and X = Br, I, OTs, or OTf; X = Cl is marginal) will undergo coupling as the nucleophilic and electrophilic coupling partners, respectively. The reaction usually takes place at room temperature or below in an ethereal solvent. Due to the wide range of applicable coupling partners, functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity, the Corey–House synthesis is a powerful and practical tool for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. However, as limitations, hindered (2° or 3°) alkyl halides are generally unsuccessful or low-yielding substrates for the Corey-House synthesis. Furthermore, alkynylcuprates are generally inert under usual coupling conditions. The forging of aryl-aryl bonds is also inefficient and much more effectively achieved using palladium catalysis.\n\nThe Corey-House synthesis is preceded by two preliminary steps to prepare the requisite Gilman reagent from an alkyl halide. In the first step, the alkyl halide is treated with lithium metal in dry ether to prepare an alkyllithium reagent, RLi. The starting alkyl halide for the lithiation step can be a primary, secondary or tertiary alkyl chloride, bromide, or iodide:\n\nIn the second step, a lithium dialkylcuprate, also known as a Gilman reagent (named after Henry Gilman of Iowa State University) is prepared from the alkyllithium by treatment with cuprous iodide (CuI) in a transmetalation reaction:\n\nIf the use of alkyllithium reagents is precluded by functional group incompatibility, transmetalation from other metals (e.g., Mg, Zn, Al, B) may be considered as alternatives for the preparation of the organocopper reagent. \n\nThe Corey-House synthesis process is the reaction between the organocopper reagent, usually a lithium dialkylcuprate as prepared above, and a second alkyl (pseudo)halide or an aryl iodide. This results in the formation of a C–C bond between the two organic fragments:\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, it is apparent that one equivalent of the R group is wasted as an ill-characterized alkylcopper species (likely polymeric; usually converted to RH upon aqueous workup) in the most common form of the Corey–House synthesis. To avoid this for cases where R is a precious or complex fragment, a reagent (R)(R)CuM, where R is an untransferable dummy ligand (e.g., R = cyano, alkynyl, 2-thienyl, etc.) can be prepared and used instead.\n\nIt is important to note that when R and R' are different, only the cross product R–R' is obtained; R–R or R'–R' are not formed in significant amounts. The Corey–House reaction is therefore an example of a cross-coupling reaction. The Corey–House synthesis is, in fact, one of the earliest transition metal-mediated (or catalyzed, see below) cross-coupling reactions to be discovered. \n\nIn the case of alkyl bromides and tosylates, inversion of configuration is observed when an configurationally pure alkyl electrophile is used. The reaction is believed to proceed via an S2-like mechanism to give a copper(III) species, which undergoes reductive elimination to give the coupling product. When alkyl iodides are used, scrambling of configuration is observed, and cyclization products are observed to form for alkyl iodides with an olefin tether, both of which are indicative of the involvement of radicals.\nIt is important to note that for this reaction to work successfully, the alkyl (pseudo)halide coupling partner should be methyl, benzylic, allylic, 1° alkyl, or 2° cycloalkyl. In most cases, 3° and acyclic 2° electrophiles give unsatisfactory results. (However, see below for recent modifications that allow 2° electrophiles to be used successfully.) On the other hand, sterically hindered organocopper reagents, including 3° and other branched alkyl reagents, are generally tolerated. However, aryl bromides, iodides and sulfonates, which do not ordinarily undergo nucleophilic substitution in the absence of a transition metal, can be used successfully as coupling partners.\n\nIn 1971, Kochi reported that Grignard reagents and alkyl bromides could be coupled using a catalytic amount of lithium tetrachlorocuprate(II), a process that was extended to alkyl tosylates by Schlosser and Fouquet. In the catalytic process, the Grignard reagent undergoes transmetalation with the copper salt or complex to generate an organocuprate as a catalytic intermediate, which then undergoes reaction with the (pseudo)halide electrophile to form the coupling product and release the copper and complete the catalytic cycle. \nUnder recently discovered conditions, using TMEDA as the ligand for copper and lithium methoxide as a base additive, it is now possible to couple 1°, 2°, and 3° Grignard reagents with 1° and 2° alkyl bromides and tosylates in high yields with nearly exclusive stereoinversion. Even β-branched 2° alkyl tosylates react to give coupling product in moderate yield, greatly expanding the scope of the catalytic Corey–House synthesis (Kochi–Schlosser coupling). \n\nWhile the coupling of organocopper compounds and allyl bromide was reported as early as 1936 by Henry Gilman (Iowa State University), this reaction was fully developed by four organic chemists (two at Harvard and two at MIT): \n\n\n"}

He started his seminary studies in Zagreb then at the Pontifical Gregorian University) in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Giuseppe Palica on 26 October 1930. \n\nHis first pastoral assignments were in the Archdiocese of Zagreb and, in 1934, was appointed private secretary to the Archbishop. In 1941 Father Šeper became the rector of the archdiocesan seminary, a post which he held for the next decade.

He set a Tokyo Big6 Baseball League record with 476 strikeouts during his college career at Waseda University and was the Pacific League Most Valuable Rookie in 2003.\n\nWada was born in Kōnan, Aichi Prefecture, a member of the age group often referred to as the \"Matsuzaka Generation\". He began playing baseball as a first grader at Kōnan Municipal Fujisato Elementary School for the Kōnan Danchi Baseball team.\n\nIn 1991, Wada and his family moved to Izumo, Shimane Prefecture, Wada's father's hometown. Wada enrolled in Shimane Prefectural Hamada High School in Hamada upon graduating from junior high, leading them to the 79th National High School Baseball Championship in the summer of his second year of high school (the equivalent of eleventh grade in the United States) in 1997. His team faced Akita Commercial High School, led by current Tokyo Yakult Swallows ace Masanori Ishikawa, in the first round, but Wada walked that very Ishikawa with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning and suffered a walk-off loss.\n\nWada's team secured a berth in the national tournament again the following summer (1998). They defeated Niigata Prefectural Shibata Agricultural High School, whose battery consisted of right-hander Togashi Kazuhiro (who later played for the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters) and catcher Ken Katoh (currently with the Yomiuri Giants), in their first game. They faced Teikyo High School, the East Tokyo champions, in their next game. Though Wada, who was not only the team's ace but also their cleanup hitter, gave up a home run to current Fighters outfielder Hichori Morimoto, Hamada High won 3-2, making it to the quarter-finals. They narrowly lost in the quarter-finals to Toyota Otani High School (led by current Orix Buffaloes outfielder Katsuaki Furuki) in extra innings.\n\nThough Wada had ruptured his left triceps muscle the previous fall and struggled to even reach with his fastball during the tournament, Teikyo High players remarked after facing Wada that \"[his fastball] looked like it was .\"\n\nWada went on to enroll at the prestigious Waseda University as a human sciences major after graduating from Hamada High. He made his collegiate debut in the fall of his freshman year, pitching in a game against the University of Tokyo on September 12. He rebuilt his pitching mechanics from scratch that year, succeeding in increasing the velocity of his fastball until it consistently hit speeds of and above within a mere two months of joining the team. He became a full-fledged starter for Waseda in the spring of his second year, drawing attention with the furious pace with which he racked up strikeouts.\n\nTaking on the uniform number 18 that had traditionally denoted the team's lefty ace (and had previously been worn by current Fighters left-hander Shugo Fujii), Wada led Waseda to consecutive Tokyo Big6 league titles in the spring and summer seasons of his senior year (2002) for the first time in university history since 1950. He received the league Best Nine Award in both seasons.\n\nThat year, Waseda earned a berth in both the 51st All-Japan University Baseball Championship Series as well as the Meiji Jingu Tournament, but the team fell short of a championship in both tournaments, losing to Asia University (whose pitching staff featured right-handers Katsuhiro Nagakawa and Hiroshi Kisanuki, both of whom would later turn professional) in the finals in the former and succumbing to Tohoku Fukushi University in the semi-finals in the latter.\n\nWada set a new Tokyo Big6 record for career strikeouts that year, surpassing the 443 set by Suguru Egawa (who later pitched for the Yomiuri Giants) and finishing with 476. He also set a new Waseda record in wins for left-handed pitchers, finishing his college career with a 27-13 record and a 1.35 ERA. His dedication and commitment were said to have had a positive influence on younger players on the team like Norichika Aoki, Takashi Toritani, Toshimitsu Higa and Shintaro Yoshida (all of whom later went pro), the core that later led Waseda to four consecutive league titles for the first time in Tokyo Big6 history.\n\nWada was dubbed the \"Dr. K (à la former Major League Baseball pitcher Dwight Gooden) of the Tokyo Big6\" during his college years and was one of the most coveted prospects in Japanese college baseball as he entered his senior year. He was signed by the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks as a pre-draft pick along with right-handermdy Nagisa Arakaki of Kyushu Kyoritsu University prior to the 2002 NPB amateur draft that fall and was assigned the uniform number 21.\n\nWada secured a spot in the Hawks' starting rotation from his rookie year (2003), making his professional debut in a regular season game against the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes on April 1 (he gave up five runs in innings). He earned the first win of his career against the Seibu Lions on April 8, pitching six shutout innings, and recorded his first career complete game win (a shutout) against the Chiba Lotte Marines on April 16. Overall, he finished the year with a 14-5 record, 3.38 ERA and 195 strikeouts (second only to young Lions right-hander Daisuke Matsuzaka's 215), earning Pacific League Most Valuable Rookie honors. He also played an instrumental role in the Hawks' league title and subsequent Japan Series championship, pitching a complete game win as a rookie for the first time in Japan Series history in Game 7 of the series. He played in the 2003 Asian Baseball Championship (which also functioned as the Asian qualifying tournament for the 2004 Athens Olympics) as a member of the Japanese national team in November, pitching shutout innings against South Korea in the final game of the tournament to clinch a berth in the upcoming Olympic Games.\n\nWada played in the 2004 Athens Olympics, contributing to Japan's bronze medal finish in the tournament by earning two wins against Canada (one in the preliminary round, the other in the bronze medal match) while holding them to two runs over twelve innings. However, he fell victim to a so-called sophomore slump in the regular season, going 10-6 but racking up a 4.35 ERA and striking out just 115 batters (despite this, his batting average against was a league-best .228).\n\nIn 2005, Wada was named the starter for the Hawks' season opener for the first time in his career, taking the mound against the Fighters on March 26 and holding them to one run over innings while striking out eight en route to the win (though he required 135 pitches). He finished the year with a 12-8 record and a much-improved 3.27 ERA, becoming the first pitcher to record double-digit wins in each of his first three seasons in Hawks franchise history since Tadashi Sugiura accomplished the feat in 1960.\n\nOn December 10, the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks made it public that Wada had married swimsuit model and actress Kasumi Nakane. The couple had their wedding ceremony at Izumo Taisha, a Shinto shrine, on December 14.\n\nWada was chosen to play in the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic as a member of the Japanese national team but saw little playing time as a middle reliever, coming on in relief in Japan's second-round match against Mexico and pitching two shutout innings in his first and only appearance of the tournament (Japan won the game 6-1).\n\nWada had perhaps his finest year yet in the regular season, pitching just innings but going 14-6 with a career-best 2.98 ERA and allowing the fewest walks and hits per inning pitched of his career (1.10). His wife, Kasumi, gave birth to their first child (a daughter) on September 13 of that year.\n\nThough Wada improved on his ERA still more by lowering it to 2.82 in the 2007 season, he was plagued by poor run support and went 12-10 for the year. He pitched the most innings (182) and amassed the most strikeouts (169) since his rookie campaign and became the only active pitcher other than the aforementioned Masanori Ishikawa (and the first in Hawks franchise history since Sugiura) to record double-digit wins in each of the first five seasons of his professional career.\n\nHe underwent endoscopic surgery in Los Angeles during the season to remove articular cartilage fragments in his left elbow after experiencing discomfort in the region during the season.\n\nThe rehab that Wada had to undergo following the elbow surgery kept him from making his first start of 2008 until April 6, roughly two-and-a-half weeks into the season. Despite the slight setback, he started the season of well, putting up eight wins before the All-Star break and garnering selection to the Japanese national team that would play in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. However, he did not pitch as had hoped in the Olympics, giving up six runs (five earned) in two starts en route to a 4.82 ERA over 9⅓ innings (albeit while striking out 13) and being one of the factors in Japan's disappointing fourth-place finish behind South Korea, Cuba and the United States.\n\nAfter returning to Japan in late August, Wada pitched 10 shutout innings and struck out 10 in one no-decision against the Saitama Seibu Lions on August 31 (the game ended in a 0-0 tie after 12 innings) and held the Lions to one run in 10 innings yet again while striking out 12 on September 20, this time in a tough 1-0 loss. While he pitched reliably, recording a 3.18 ERA in his final six starts of the season, he was victimized by a lack of run support and failed to put up double-digit wins for the first time in his professional career.\n\nIn 2009, Wada was named to the national team's preliminary roster for the upcoming World Baseball Classic along with teammates first baseman Nobuhiko Matsunaka, starter Toshiya Sugiuchi, closer Takahiro Mahara and shortstop Munenori Kawasaki. However, though he took part in the training camp held in Miyazaki in mid-February, he and Matsunaka were cut from the final 28-man team before the tournament.\n\nWada showed no signs of disappointment in his pitching, taking the mound in the Hawks' season opener on April 3 and striking out 14 (tying both his career high and the NPB record for strikeouts in a season opener) en route to a three-hit, complete game shutout against the Buffaloes in one of the most dominant starts of his young career. However, more injury trouble found Wada in the form of left elbow inflammation. He went to the United States for treatment, and was taken off the active roster on June 11. He was expected to miss at least three weeks initially, but did not return until September 9, when he was hammered by the Chiba Lotte Marines for 6 runs in 3 and 2/3 innings. Wada finished 2009 with a record of 4-5 with a 4.06 ERA.\n\nWada started the 2010 campaign pegged as the fourth starter in the rotation behind Toshiya Sugiuchi, Kenji Ohtonari, and D.J. Houlton. His first start of the season came against the Orix Buffaloes, and he gave up two runs on three hits in five innings, walking two and striking out eight. Despite the performance, he took the loss. More of the same came from Wada in his second outing against the Saitama Seibu Lions, as he gave up four runs on five hits in five innings, but he managed to get the win.\n\nHis third start was one of the best in his career, as he gave up one run on four hits in a complete-game effort, striking out a career-high 15 Marines to record his second win of the season. He continued his winning ways into interleague, where he won all five of his starts, going at least six innings every start and striking out at least five batters, by the end of interleague, he had won nine games.\n\nWada was selected for the All Star Series in 2010 and started game 1. His team-mate Sugiuchi Toshiya started game 2. They lead the Pacific League in wins through most of the season. It was their fine form that carried the Hawks to the league title in 2010 as the rest of the team's starters struggled. Wada was named Pacific league MVP for the 2010 season, helping the Hawks win the regular season pacific league pennant.\n\nWada and the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks defeated the Chunichi Dragons in seven games to win the 2011 Japan Series.\n\nOn December 14, 2011, Wada agreed to a two-year deal with the Orioles, including an option for a third year.\n\nWada underwent Tommy John surgery on May 11, 2012 due to a partially torn ligament in his left elbow and spent the rest of the 2012 season on the disabled list. He started the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list, and was expected to join the Orioles around June 1, 2013. He started a rehab assignment with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides on May 16. On June 14, he was activated from the 60-day disabled list and optioned to Norfolk.\nWada signed a minor-league contract with invitation to spring training with the Chicago Cubs on January 24, 2014, but he was released on March 23, 2014. He re-signed with the Cubs on another minor league contract the next day. His contract was selected from the Triple-A Iowa Cubs on June 22, and he was optioned to Iowa. He was recalled by the Cubs on July 8, and started the second game of that day's doubleheader against the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nIn 2014 Wada compiled a 4-4 record and a 3.25 ERA. His strongest outing came on August 24, 2014 when he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the Baltimore Orioles. He was removed from the game after giving up a solo home run, the only hit he allowed in the contest. The Cubs won 2-1, and Wada was credited with the win. He was signed to a one-year $4 million contract after the season. Wada made seven starts for the Cubs during May and June 2015 before suffering a shoulder injury, he returned in September but pitched out of the bullpen.\n\nWada returned to Japan, signing with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball for the 2016 season. In 2016 season, Wada finished the regular season with a 24 Games pitched, a 15–5 Win–loss record, a 3.04 ERA, a 157 strikeouts in 163 innings. And he was honored with the 2016 Pacific League the most wins Champion and 2016 Pacific League Winning percentage leader.\n\nOn May 22, Wada had left elbow surgery and spent three months in rehabilitation. On August 27, he made a comeback and pitched against the Chiba Lotte Marines, and recorded 1,500 strikeouts in total. In 2017 season, he finished the regular season with a 8 Games pitched, a 4–0 Win–loss record, a 2.49 ERA, a 34 strikeouts in 47 innings. On November 1, he pitched against the Yokohama DeNA BayStars as a starting pitcher in the 2017 Japan Series.\n\nWada spent the 2018 season on rehabilitation for left shoulder pain.\n\nOn June 5, Wada made a comeback and pitched Interleague play (NPB) against the Chunichi Dragons. In 2019 season, he finished the regular season with a 12 Games pitched, a 4–4 Win–loss record, a 3.90 ERA, a 45 strikeouts in 57 2/3 innings. On October 23, he pitched against the Yomiuri Giants as a starting pitcher in the 2019 Japan Series, and won the game for the first time in 16 years since the 2003 rookie year.\nWada is a 5 ft 11 in, 180 lb, left-handed pitcher with an unorthodox delivery, throwing from an overhand arm slot but deceiving hitters by keeping his throwing arm back and delaying its swing as he drives to the plate with his lower body.\n\nWada's four-seam fastball has good late life but decidedly below-average velocity, topping out at 92 mph and usually sitting at 88-89 mph. He compensates for this with his deceptive arm swing and late release point, complementing it with a solid-average slider, an occasional curveball, and a changeup.\n\nWhile Wada has good command of his pitches overall, recording a career walks per nine innings rate of 2.46 (until 2011 season), he has established somewhat of a reputation as a pitcher who is prone to throwing mistake pitches and giving up a large number of home runs. However, he has shown marked improvement in this area since making his professional debut, giving up progressively fewer homers in every season of his career except for 2005.\n\n"}

Snorri also who drew inspiration from Þjóðólfr to redact his own version of the myths told in \"Haustlöng\".\n\nThe poem describes mythological scenes said by the skald to have been painted on a shield: Loki's betraying of Iðunn, the Æsir's \"old-age cure\", who was snatched from them by the eagle-shaped jötunn Þjazi; and Thor's victorious combat against the strongest of the jötnar, Hrungnir.\n\nThe title of the poem, \"Haustlǫng\", translated as 'Autumn-long', may refer to its period of composition or gestation by the skald, identified from a relatively early period with Þjóðólfr of Hvinir.\n\nThe stanzas 1–13 of the poem depicts the encounter of the Æsir (gods) Odin, Loki and Hœnir with the jötunn Þjazi in the form of an eagle.\n\nAs the three gods Odin, Loki and Hœnir are trying to cook an ox, the eagle-shaped Þjazi asks for some. Loki strikes at him with a staff, but the latter sticks to the eagle and to Loki's hand as the bird flies out. The eagle then asks Loki to bring him the gods' \"old-age cure\", Iðunn.\nWithout Iðunn, tells the poet, \"all Ingi-Freyr’s kin [the Æsir] became old and grey in their assembly; the powers were rather ugly in form\". Then the gods catch Loki and force him to get Iðunn back: \"‘You shall be trapped, Loki,’ the angry one spoke thus, ‘unless by some scheme you bring back the renowned maid, enlarger of the fetters' [gods'] joy.\" Loki flies to Jötunheimar with the help of a hawk's flight-skin. There the Jötnar direct a storm-wind against the eagle-shaped god to keep him out from their abode.\n\nIn the stanzas 14–20 of \"Haustlöng\", Þjóðólfr depicts Thor's journey to the duel with the jötunn Hrungnir while the entire cosmos reacts. Then Hrungnir and Thor fight by hurling their weapons at each other (the jötunn's whetstone and Thor's hammer), and the poem alludes at the end to the removal of the piece of whetstone from Thor's head. Compared to Snorri Sturluson's account, Þjóðólfr emphasizes more on Thor's journey to the battle, escorted by noise and flames, while Snorri makes relatively little of it and also describes Hrungnir's journey. Thor's servant Þjálfi and Hrungnir's clay-made giant Mokkurkálfi are absent from Þjóðólfr’s version.\nTwo other verses of \"Haustlöng\" have survived for they are also cited in the 13th-century Prose Edda:\n\n\n\nTwo other verses attributed to Þjóðólfr by Snorri in the Prose Edda were instead redacted by the 9th-century skald Þorbjörn Hornklofi.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2076047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076047", "title": "Education in Uganda", "text": "Education in Uganda\n\nThe system of education in Uganda has a structure of 7 years of primary education, 6 years of secondary education (divided into 4 years of lower secondary and 2 years of upper secondary school), and 3 to 5 years of post-secondary education, according to Education News Uganda The government of Uganda recognizes education as a basic human right and continues to strive to provide free primary education to all children in the country. However, issues with funding, teacher training, rural populations, and inadequate facilities continue to hinder the progress of educational development in Uganda. Girls in Uganda are disproportionately discriminated against in terms of education; they face harsher barriers when trying to gain an education and it has left the female population disenfranchised, despite government efforts to close the gap.\n\nThe present system of education, known as Universal Primary Education (UPE), has existed since 1997, and its introduction was the result of democratisation and open elections, as there was great popular support for free education. Despite its promising boosts in enrolment, issues with funding and organisation have continued to plague the UPE. In 1999 there were six million pupils receiving primary education, compared to only two million in 1986. Numbers received a boost in 1997 when free primary education was made available to four children per family. According to Education News Uganda, one of the authoritative publications in Uganda, only some of primary school graduates go on to take any form of secondary education.\n\nThis is contingent upon their passing their Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE).\n\nUganda is one of East Africa's developing countries, bordered by Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and Kenya. It occupies and has 26,404,543 people. According to CIA World Fact Book 2004, more than 80 percent of its population is rural and 35% of the people lives below poverty line. The United Nations characterised the current condition of Uganda with its unstable government and struggling people as \"the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.\"\n\nIn 1997 the Ugandan government introduced the Universal Primary Education (UPE) program to improve enrollment and attainment in primary schools. It was initially realized to provide free education for four children per family, but the program was not performing based in its regulations due to the complex structure of Ugandan families. Most Ugandan families have more than four children and households started sending every child, which resulted in a rapid increase in student enrollment in primary schools. Due to the circumstances, President Museveni announced that the UPE was open to all children of all families (Omona 74). When the new policy was executed, schools experienced a massive influx of pupils and the demand for learning materials, teachers, and infrastructure became a challenge to the education system. Ngaka argues that the UPE resulted in costly consequences, including but not limited to a poor quality education, low pupil achievement, untrained teachers, improper infrastructures and classroom settings. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative gives Uganda a score of 92.3% for primary school enrolment.\n\nUganda has seven years of primary education and the legal age for school entry is six. According to the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) statistics, school enrollments increased from three million to 5.3 million in 1997 and the number rapidly increased to seven million by 2004. Even though the increased number of pupils was perceived as a good thing, there were only 125,883 teachers, exceeding the UPE required pupil-teacher ratio of 1:40. The large number of pupils worsens the learning environment and it becomes harder for the teacher to be heard and teach. According to Arbeiter and Hartley, classes have between 70 and 150 pupils and there is over-age studying in all schools. Moyi explains the issue of many classes having the inappropriate age of pupils as having been driven by late enrolment or grade repetition, which in turn is caused by the poor quality of education. For instance, “third grade included pupils aged between seven to sixteen years and in sixth grade there were pupils up to nineteen years of age.\"\n\nThere is a significant disparity between enrolment rates in primary and secondary schools in Uganda. Census data from 2004 indicates that for every ten students enrolled in primary schools, only one is enrolled at a secondary institution. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative gives Uganda a score of 36%. The structure of Uganda's secondary education system follows the education system of its former colonial masters, Britain. It is divided into the Ordinary level and Advanced level.\nLower secondary consists of 4 years of schooling at the end of which students undertake Ordinary-level exams (O-level) in at least 8 subjects with a maximum of 10 subjects. Upper secondary consists of 2 years of schooling at the end of which students sit Advanced-level exams (A-level) in at least 3 subjects.\n\nThe curriculum for lower secondary is currently being reviewed by the National Curriculum Development Centre, and a new curriculum is expected to be rolled out in 2014 or 2015.\n\nThree-year technical schools provide an alternative to lower secondary school. Alternatives for graduates from lower secondary school include: 2-3 year Technical institutes; 2 year Primary Teacher Colleges (PTC); Department Training Colleges (DTCs) and Upper secondary schools; including:\n\n\nAlthough 60,000 to 70,000 students in Uganda leave secondary school each year qualified to go on to higher education, only some 35 per cent of them (at most 25,000) are able to find places at the limited number of institutions. The majority of students go to universities, both public and private. Makerere University in Kampala has about 95 percent of the total student population in Uganda's universities. The remainder are distributed among the more than 20 private universities and a smaller number of non-university institutions. Recognised universities in Uganda include:\n\n\n\n\nVocational and Technical Education is a necessary aspect of the education system in Uganda. The UN has led efforts to support this form of education through the UNESCO subdivision International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). According to a UN report, \"Uganda’s TVET mission is defined as being to ensure that individuals and enterprises acquire the skills they need to raise productivity and income.\" These TVET programs range in both complexity and scope. Some provide for craftsmen or technician level training that replaces standard modes of secondary education, while some TVET programs provide graduate engineering level education to students seeking education at the tertiary or post secondary level.\n\nEarly literacy movements were characterized by Western aid and leadership and have since given way to a more local decentralized approach to adult and youth literacy in Uganda. This transition is due in part to the realization of leaders in the West and in Uganda that literacy, and literacy in English particularly, is not a silver bullet for solving Uganda's economic issues. Much of the literacy work is conducted by NGOs acting on a local level in conjunction with local or village governments. There is a great demand for these programs, and their rates of return, satisfaction, and literacy retention for graduates have been high. However, these programs face great challenges including lack of funding, social reluctance, and a general lack of appreciation for literacy and literature.\n\nEducation is important for a successful post-conflict transition in Northern Uganda (see Conflict in Northern Uganda), as it helps develop peoples' abilities to break free of circles of violence and suffering. Uganda's Universal Primary Education (UPE) has resulted in high enrolment rates in Northern Uganda, but education tends to be of a low quality and few pupils actually complete primary school. There are inadequate facilities; e.g. out of 238 primary schools in Pader, 47 are still under trees, limited teacher accommodation is causing high rates of teacher absenteeism and in some areas the average primary school teacher to student ratio is 1:200.\n\nFurthermore, there is some evidence to suggest completion of secondary school is necessary to provide an individual with a proper chance to escape poverty, as employment and income levels for those who completed primary schools are similar to those who did not attend at all. Their region has particular difficulties as teachers are hard to find, the conflict created a lost generation without an adequate education themselves and teachers from other areas are still highly concerned about security in the region.\n\nLiteracy discrepancies and educational inequity are a serious factor in the propagation of gender inequality. Female school attendance at all levels of society in Uganda is lower than that of men. This can be attributed to poverty, inadequate infrastructure, social pressures, and early maternity. These barriers continue throughout a woman's life, as one cited challenge to adult females' participation in literacy education in Uganda is home life. A World Bank report found that a significant force in preventing attendance at adult literacy classes was husbands stopping their wives from attending. According to United Nations' Girls Education Initiative statistics, literacy rates for young females still lag behind that of young boys by five percent, and nearly half of all girls in Uganda are married before the age of 18. Studies have shown that marriage and pregnancy rates prior to the age of 18 is decreased by roughly 7% when girls receive an extra year of education.\n\nSince 1997, UPE has aimed to bring equality of education to all the children of the country, specifically to those in rural, impoverished areas. It has had controversial results, but overall the UPE program has successfully allowed for higher enrollment, specifically among young girls. However, there is no clarity over whether there are true gender discrimination factors affecting whether the children go to school; it is noted that girls enrollment is dependent upon their age and their mother's level of schooling. Boys, on the other hand, are not affected by their father or mother's education level. Uganda received a score of .517 on the UN Development Programme Gender Equality index as reported in the Human Development Report. This measure evaluates the respective equality of women in various dimensions including: health, empowerment, and access to labor market.\n\nUganda implemented the National Strategy for Girls' Education (NSGE) in order to bring equality in the education system for both women and girls and indicates some of the various impediments to them obtaining an education, and particularly secondary education. Ultimately, the NSGE framework is more inclined to identify these barriers rather than offer insight to help overcome these obstacles such as location, menstruation, home responsibilities and overall attitudes within the school domain.\n\nIn 2007 the government implemented Universal Secondary Education (USE) with research showing that girls secondary public education enrollment rates increased approximately 49%. This policy is most beneficial to girls of poor households who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to attend due to fees and the general belief that boys secondary education yields more benefits than a girls. There are a few explanations for the increased enrollment aside from the USE policy such as poor or inaccurate reporting of student enrollment, the growing population, and new schools being built or included in the USE policy. Further, the overall performance since the USE has been utilized has decreased in the schools, as teachers are working in worse conditions and students are not as motivated, especially as their parents have now seen education as completely in the realm of the government whereas the policy meant to involve a plethora of actors to support children's education.\n\nThe government has attempted various policies targeted at adult education, with inconsistent results. These include: the Functional Adult Literacy (FAL) Programme, Women's Empowerment Programme (WEP), and the National Adult Literacy Strategic Investment Plan (NALSIP). Some results prove that these programmes have bettered the living conditions of women, as they have increased influence in decision making, greater economic accumulation, better self-esteem, and knowledge of their rights in society. However, these results are not widespread; many women do not register for these programmes, especially those in the rural parts of Uganda. The women who do choose to enroll often have low attendance rates or high drop-out rates.\n\n\n\n"}

They had a blues-based sound and scored a Top 5 hit in the United States in 1969 with a cover of the Burt Bacharach song \"Baby It's You\", featuring Gayle McCormick on lead vocals. This disc sold over one million copies between July and October 1969, out-charted popular versions by the Beatles and the Shirelles, and received a gold record awarded by the R.I.A.A.\n\nThe group evolved from \"The Smiths\" (not to be confused with later English band The Smiths), which featured two of the same members, and had attempted a hit single with \"Now I Taste The Tears\", produced and arranged by Ron Budnik. \"Tears\" was a brooding, foreboding sounding record that didn't chart well. When the band did not succeed, McCormick, who had started her career singing songs by Tina Turner, Etta James and others, was added as a front woman and lead vocalist. The group were then discovered by 1960s rocker Del Shannon in a nightclub in Los Angeles. Shannon arranged \"Baby It's You\" for the group and got them signed to the ABC-Dunhill label.\n\nSmith released an album titled \"A Group Called Smith\", which spent 11 weeks in the Top 40 album listings of the since-called \"Billboard\" 200 record chart. On the album, vocals were split amongst Rich Cliburn, Jerry Carter and McCormick. Smith recorded a second album titled \"Minus-Plus\" with lesser success since it only reached #74. Smith's version of \"The Weight\" was included on the epochal \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack because, due to contractual reasons, The Band's version, which appeared in the movie, was unavailable. Most of their material consisted of covers of popular rock and R&B tunes.\n\nThe band's singles \"Take a Look Around\" and \"What Am I Gonna Do\" reached the charts, but the group broke up after two albums. The band's hit \"Baby It's You\" was featured in Quentin Tarantino's Grindhouse film, \"Death Proof\".\n\nAfter Smith disbanded, McCormick went on to record three solo albums, \"Gayle McCormick\" in 1971, \"Flesh & Blood\" in 1972 and \"One More Hour\" in 1974. The single \"It's A Cryin' Shame\" from her eponymous first album was a minor hit for her, reaching #44 on the charts in 1971. It and \"Gonna Be Alright Now\" were included on the 1994 reissue of \"A Group Called Smith\".\n\n\nSmith was composed of one woman and four men:\n\n"}

He was baptised two days later, on 28 August. Döpfner had a sister, Maria, and two brothers, Paul and Otto. Entering the Augustinian-run \"gymnasium\" at Münnerstadt in 1924, he later attended the Seminary of Würzburg and the Pontifical German-Hungarian College in Rome. Döpfner was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Luigi Traglia on 29 October 1939, and then finished his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained a doctorate in theology in 1941, writing his dissertation on Cardinal John Henry Newman. He worked as a chaplain in Großwallstadt until 1944.\n\nOn 11 August 1948, Döpfner was appointed Bishop of Würzburg by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 14 October from Archbishop Joseph Kolb, with Bishops Joseph Schröffer and Arthur Landgraf serving as co-consecrators. The consecration took place in the Neumünster Collegiate church, Würzburg, due to the fact that Würzburg Cathedral was unusable due to the Bombing of Würzburg in World War II.\n\nHe was named Bishop of Berlin on 15 January 1957, and became the youngest member of the College of Cardinals when he was created Cardinal-Priest of \"Santa Maria della Scala\" (pro hac vice) by Pope John XXIII in the Consistory of 15 December 1958.\n\nPromoted to Archbishop of Munich and Freising on 3 July 1961, Döpfner participated in the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), and sat on its Board of Presidency.

He was often described as \"papabile\", but he died at age 62 in the archiepiscopal residence of Munich.\n\nThe Cardinal, who was considered liberal in his positions, criticised the Church's \"antiquated forms\" and its \"resisting ideas, forms and possibilities to which perhaps the future belongs, and we often consider as impossible that which will finally manifest itself as a legitimate form of Christianity\".\n\nHe was deeply involved with the question of birth control, serving as co-deputy on the Vatican's commission to study the topics of marriage, family, and regulation of birth.\n\nHe also supported ecumenism.\n\n"}

He is the older brother of Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martínez, and is currently a senior advisor in Latin America for the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nMartínez was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent on September 1, 1984 and was the youngest player in the National League when he made his major league debut on August 13, 1988 against the San Francisco Giants. He allowed only one run on four hits in 7 2/3 innings in a game the Dodgers eventually won in 11 innings. He got his first career win on August 29 against the Montreal Expos. That season, he won his first and only World Series ring with the 1988 Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nHe had a breakout season in 1990, when he won 20 games, struck out 18 batters in a game (on June 4), was selected an All-Star, and finished second in strikeouts as well as in the Cy Young Award balloting. He remained a solid pitcher for several years, winning 17 games in 1991 and 1995. On July 14 of the latter year, Martínez no-hit the Florida Marlins 7-0 at Dodger Stadium. In his no-hitter, the only thing that kept him from a perfect game was a walk to Tommy Gregg with two outs in the 8th inning.\n\nEarly in the 1998 season, Martínez suffered a torn rotator cuff and torn cartilage, which was surgically repaired on June 30. The Dodgers did not pick up a $5.6 million option after 1998 and he signed with the Boston Red Sox.\n\nIn 11 seasons with the Dodgers, he was 123-77 with a 3.45 ERA and 1,314 strikeouts and was the team's opening day starter five times.\n\nRamón started the 1999 season in the minor leagues for rehabilitation. He was called up by the Red Sox in August, to pitch again alongside brother Pedro, making four starts for a 3-1 record with an ERA of 3.05. Martinez was less successful in 2000, with a record of 10-8 and a 6.03 ERA, and his option for 2001 was not picked up by the Red Sox.\n\nAfter his two years with the Red Sox, he signed again with the Dodgers, but they released him at the end of spring training. He played briefly with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2001 before retiring.\n\nRamón has three brothers, Pedro, Nelson and Jesus.\n\nWhile he was a starter for the Dodgers, Ramón repeatedly asserted that Pedro was an even better pitcher than he was. Nevertheless, Dodgers management thought Pedro was too small to be successful and traded him away. Pedro went on to win three Cy Young Awards with the Expos and Red Sox, and was a first-ballot inductee to the Hall of Fame in 2015. Ramón and Pedro were eventually reunited as teammates during Ramón's two years with the Red Sox.\n\nThe youngest brother, Jesus also played professional baseball in the Dodgers farm system. He was briefly called up to the Majors in September, 1996 but never got into a game.\n\n"}

She was buried in the grounds of Medinet Habu, in a tomb chapel that \"she shared with her natural mother and adoptive grandmother.\" Her sarcophagus was reused in a Ptolemaic tomb at Deir el-Medina, and today, is located in the Cairo Museum.\n\nA stela often referred to as the \"Adoption Stela\", was unearthed in 1897 by Georges Legrain at Karnak and moved to the Cairo Museum. It is made from red granite and measures roughly in height and in width.\n\nThe beginning of the inscription is lost, but the remainder continues with an inscription relating that Pharaoh Psamtik I is reporting to the court his intention to give his daughter to Amun to be a God's Wife. Psamtik acknowledged that the current God's Wife, Shepenupet II, daughter of pharaoh Piye of the 25th Dynasty, already had an heir in Taharqa's daughter Amenirdis II, who was officiating as Divine Adoratrice of Amun. Psamtik intended to compel Shepenupet to adopt Nitocris as her heir, thus supplanting Amenirdis II in the succession.\n\nThe court praised the pharaoh's decision and, in his regnal “year 9, first month of the first season, day 28” (a date identified with March 2, 656 BC) Nitocris departed from Sais to Thebes on a royal flotilla led by the admiral and nomarch of Herakleopolis Magna, Sematawytefnakht.\n\nAfter sixteen days the flotilla reached Thebes, whose population acclaimed the arrival of the princess. Both Shepenupet II and Amenirdis II met Nitocris. She was adopted formally and both agreed to convey their properties to her (and, indirectly, to Psamtik I).\n\nThen the stela reports a very detailed list with all the daily donations (mainly food) to Nitocris from several officials such as the mayor of Thebes, Mentuemhat, and his family, from the priesthood of Amun that at this time was led by the High Priest of Amun, Harkhebi, as well as from the king and many temples of the whole Land.\n\nShepenupet II and Amenirdis II were the last vestiges of the vanished 25th Dynasty, yet they held this highest position of power in the south and practically controlled the entirety of Upper Egypt. Psamtik I chose not to remove the God's Wife in charge forcefully – an action that would be unpopular – but to make her adopt his daughter as her successor, thus ensuring the future control of Upper Egypt, as well as receiving a considerable number of properties and other goods: beyond the “facade” of the adoption of Nitocris, the stela \"de facto\" reports the reunification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the aegis of Psamtik, after centuries of fragmentation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2076117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076117", "title": "Iraqi Police", "text": "Iraqi Police\n\nThe Iraqi Police (IP) is the uniformed police force responsible for the enforcement of civil law in Iraq. Its organisation, structure and recruitment were guided by the Coalition Provisional Authority after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and it is commanded by the reformed Iraqi Ministry of the Interior. \"IP\" refers to the Iraqi Police, and \"ISF\" to the broader Iraqi security forces. The current commander of the Federal Police Forces is Lieutenant General Raed Shaker Jawdat.\n\nThe current Iraqi Police has some links with the pre-war Iraqi police service.\nThe prewar police service was low in repression priority and was professional. Therefore, the police was expected to remain cohesive and be a useful instrument also after the invasion.\n\nIt was intended to form the basis for the police force of the new Iraq, but the civil disorder caused this project to be abandoned.\nFollowing the emergency stipend payment, some police came back especially in Baghdad and the U.S. Army military police conducted emergency training. At the same time, in the south the British forces began to establish local police forces in coordination with Shiite religious leaders.\n\nIn the north, Kurdish security forces did not experience any interruption, and in Mosul a thousand former police officers were hired by Major General David Petraeus in order to maintain the public order.\n\nIn the meantime, the Coalition Provisional Authority worked with the renewed Ministry of Interior in order to purge Baathist officials (7,000 police officers fired by Bernard Kerik only in Baghdad) and to establish a police forces in short terms. In the first four months, the first training course was launched and over 4,000 officers were trained. In 2003 recruitment, applicants were mostly former soldiers and police officers who served under the Baathist rule. At the end of 2003, Iraqi Police formally totalled 50,000 officers.\n\nIn 2009 the Iraqi Police was under the command of Major General Hussein Jassim Alawadi. The Multi-National Security Transition Command – Iraq (MNSTC-I) was a United States Central Command organisation tasked to train, mentor and equip all Iraqi civilian security forces. MNSTC-I also had the goal of training their counterparts in the Iraqi government of Iraq to assume their role. MNSTC-I was dissolved in 2010. The Iraqi Police had three main branches:\n\nBy 2012-13 there were four Federal Police Divisions, spread out around the country. The 1st and 2nd Motorized Divisions were headquartered in Baghdad and created out of the former Commando Division and the Public Order Division. The 3rd Federal Police Division, with its headquarters in Mosul, collapsed in the ISIS 2014 Northern Iraq offensive by 9 June. The 4th Division was headquartered in Basra. Some reinforcing units, such as the 9th Brigade, 4th Federal Police Division, also withered once deployed to the front lines.\n\nThe Iraqi Police Service uniform consists of a long-sleeved, light-blue shirt with a blue brassard on the left arm with an embroidered Iraqi flag and \"Iraqi Police\" embossed in English and Arabic, black or light-blue trousers or blue combat trousers similar to those of the United States Navy. They wear a dark-blue baseball cap with \"POLICE\" in white letters or body armour and a PASGT helmet.\n\nFederal Police wear a black-and-blue camouflage uniform similar to the U.S. Army Combat Uniform Universal Camouflage Pattern, which includes a baseball cap, body armour and PASGT helmet. FP uniforms are issued when an officer has completed training; officers not yet trained wear a variety of uniforms, including woodland camouflage. FP officers are organised into brigades which cover geographic areas. Rank insignia for the IP is nearly identical to that of the Iraqi Army, except that the shoulder boards are usually dark blue.\n\nOfficers ranks and ranks of NCOs and constables are the same that of Iraqi army, from highest to lowest, with symbol on epaulette, as below:\n\n\nThe Iraqi Police has faced a number of problems since it was reformed by the Coalition Provisional Authority after the fall of Baghdad. It became the target of fighters from inside and outside Iraq; thousands of officers have been killed by gunfire and bombings by Iraqi insurgents, foreign terrorists and, in some cases, friendly fire from Coalition troops. An estimated 4,250 Iraqi police officers were killed from January 2005 and 4 March 2006. Due to high unemployment in Iraq, many young Iraqi men have volunteered to join the police forces. A number of recruits have been killed by suicide bombers and suicide car bombs whilst queueing at police stations.\n\nThe IP has also been infiltrated by insurgents, who use access to privileged information, training and weapons for their own motives. Many police stations have been attacked, blown up, had weapons stolen from them and have been occupied by opponents of the Iraqi government; as a result, many police officers have abandoned their posts. As of October 7, 2006, 12,000 Iraqi Police deserted and 4,000 were killed.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, a market owner was killed by a police officer after a brawl began when the market owner \"refused to back his vehicle\" in Baghdad.\n\nThe Baathist regime began to increase the role of Islam in government during the early 1990s, with required religious education in the schools, honor killings and religious committees to punish those deemed in violation of traditional mores (such as adultery, fornication and homosexuality).\n\nThe Iraqi constitution stipulates Islam as the official religion, enacted laws must conform to sharia and provisions for civil rights and liberties are in accordance with public mores. Many members of the Iraqi police and Interior Ministry have ties to the Islamic fundamentalist Badr Brigade, which have been given leeway to punish those suspected of immorality. In Basra, police guarding a local park reportedly made no attempt to stop an armed group from severely beating two women and shooting a male Iraqi friend of theirs to death.\n\nThe Iraqi government has been accused of using (or allowing) the police and other groups to carry out sectarian killings and kidnappings of Sunni Iraqis. In December 2005, US troops found 625 inmates held in \"very overcrowded\" conditions in a Baghdad Interior Ministry building. Twelve of the prisoners reportedly had signs of torture and malnutrition. The story gave credence to the accusations, sowing further distrust of the police force. A report into the findings at the building was promised by Iraqi president Ibrahim Jaafari at the end of December 2005, but as of 4 May 2006 no report was issued.\n\nThe United States Department of State released a 2006 human rights report accusing the Iraqi police of widespread atrocities. In October of that year, the Iraqi government dismantled a police brigade with connections to sectarian death squads. The dismantled brigade was transferred to a US base for retraining. Other police brigades will be investigated for links to death squads.\n\nThe number of police is difficult to estimate, since local police chiefs may exaggerate their numbers to obtain increased funding for their stations and people drift in and out of service. Although the total Ministry of Interior payroll exceeds 300,000, many are off-duty at any given time. As of mid-2007, the National Police Forces employed about 25,000 officers. The number is somewhat misleading, because one-third to one-half of the NP are on leave at any given time.\n\nIraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bulani announced that as of December 24, 2005, 12,000 police officers in Iraq died in the line of duty since the 2003 US-led invasion.\n\nLarge-scale operations were conducted by coalition forces to assist in policing and train the Iraqi Police (IP) and security forces. Police transition teams (PTTs) are US military-police squads deployed to Iraqi Police stations. The teams conduct joint patrols with the IP, share station defense and gather station information and counter-terrorism intelligence. The joint patrols of the PTTs have helped curb violence, increasing respect for Iraq's police force. These duties were later performed by United States Air Force Security Forces members. An International Police Liaison Officer (IPLO), an experienced US police officer, accompanied most of the transition teams to aid post-academy training of the IP.\n\nNational Police Transition Teams (NPTT) are 11-man military transition teams embedded in Iraqi Police units at the battalion, brigade, division and corps levels. These teams are supplied by the US Army and the US Marine Corps. Like the PTTs, each team is assisted by an IPLO and one to six local interpreters.\n\nMembers of the Iraqi Police use the Glock 19 and HS2000 handgun, and may carry a shotgun, Type 81, or AK-47 rifle on patrol. Iraqi Federal Police have also been seen using the Croatian-made HS Produkt VHS-2 bullpup carbine during military options against ISIS in northern Iraq. For marine operations, the police are equipped with Safe Boat International 230 T-Top patrol boats.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2076134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076134", "title": "Nickajack", "text": "Nickajack\n\nThe ill-defined area known as \"Nickajack\" generally refers to the rugged Appalachian foothills in eastern Tennessee and northeastern Alabama. \"Nickajack\" is a corruption of the Cherokee word ᎠᏂ ᎫᏌᏘ Ᏹ (Ani-Kusati-yi) which translates to Coosa Town, but more likely references Koasati Town.\n\nIn the late 18th century during the ongoing war with the Chickamauga, the area was inhabited by Chickamauga Cherokee and Muscogee-Creek warriors residing in the \"Five Lower Towns\" on the Tennessee River (near present-day Chattanooga). The warriors were mostly made up of the Cherokee, led by Dragging Canoe. Small groups of Shawnee and Creek lived with and fought with them, in addition to the occasional bands of Muskogee, who also served as allies. Renegade whites; white traders; Spanish, French, and British agents; and runaway slaves also inhabited the area.\n\nAfter those wars, the settlement of Nickajack Town eclipsed the neighboring town of Running Water (Dragging Canoe's seat of operations) as the dominant town in the immediate area, due to its position on the river near the crossing of the \"Federal Road\" running from Athens to Nashville over the Tennessee River. One of the town's more prominent residents, Turtle-at-Home (Dragging Canoe's brother), owned the ferry at that crossing and had other commercial interests. In addition, Turtle-at-Home was on the council of the Lower Towns and served as Speaker of the Cherokee National Council.\n\nNickajack Cave, formerly called Tecallassee, near the site of the former town, may have been used as a hideout and cache by the Chickamauga Cherokee. Its deposits of bat guano were mined by Confederate forces during the Civil War, and the cave became one of the leading sources of saltpeter for the Confederate Powderworks at Augusta, Georgia. The road used to transport the material became known as the \"Nickajack Trail\".\n\n\"Nickajack\" was made up of loosely defined regions of North Alabama and East Tennessee where popular sentiment remained loyal to the Union, and were decidedly anti-slavery.\n\nIn the period leading up to the American Civil War, there had been increasing talk of secession by the politicians representing wealthy plantation owners in the Black Belt. Hill country residents, however, were typically poor dirt-farmers and rarely slave owners. They believed such a war of secession would be \"a war for the rich, fought by the poor,\" and they wanted to have nothing to do with it.\n\nOn January 7, 1861, Alabama Governor Andrew B. Moore called delegates from Alabama to Montgomery for a convention to debate the Articles of Secession. Delegates from South Alabama wanted the convention delegates to determine the vote, while northern delegates wanted the issue put to a popular vote. Because the apportionment of delegates to the convention was based on total population (including slaves), the Southern delegates effectively voted \"on behalf\" of the African-American slaves, who made up a large proportion of the population in the region. The results of the poll determined that the balance of power would shift to the North, where the population was mostly white.\n\nUltimately, the Alabama Ordinance of Secession was passed by a vote of 61 to 39, split along geographic lines. In addition to Nickajack, Winston County, Alabama, threatened to form its own Free State of Winston. These threats of internal separation never materialized, but men in the region fiercely resisted conscription into the Confederate Army, with many joining the Union Army.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2076157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076157", "title": "Bridgewater Bridge (Tasmania)", "text": "Bridgewater Bridge (Tasmania)\n\nThe Bridgewater Bridge and Causeway is a road and rail bridge that carries the Midland Highway (A1) and South Railway Line across the Derwent River in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The steel truss vertical lift bridge and specially-built causeway connect the Hobart suburbs of and . The bridge was completed in 1946 and accommodates a two-lane highway, a single track railway and a grade-separated footpath. \n\nThe bridge is the major connector of the Midland Highway on the eastern shore and the Brooker Highway on the western shore. The bridge is the oldest surviving lift span bridge in Australia; and lifting of the bridge can cause considerable traffic delays.\n\nThe Bridgewater Bridge was one of the first bridges constructed in Tasmania following British settlement in 1803, and gave its name to the nearby suburb of Bridgewater. Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur commissioned the construction of the bridge and causeway as part of the Launceston Hobart Trunk Road, linking both Tasmanian towns and providing easier access to farmlands in the interior of Tasmania.\n\nConstruction commenced on the bridge in 1829. Operations were supervised by Roderic O'Connor. The causeway, which was constructed first, was built by a workforce of 200 convicts who had been condemned to secondary punishment. These convicts, using nothing but wheelbarrows, shovels and picks and sheer muscle power, shifted of soil, stones and clay. The finished causeway stretched , although did not span the full width of the Derwent. The original plan apparently called for a viaduct, but this plan was abandoned and the half-built arches were filled in to form the present causeway.\n\nUpon completion of the causeway, a punt operated across the deep, navigable section of the river, but could not cope with traffic demands. To resolve this issue, the first bridge across this point of the Derwent opened in 1849. The bridge was designed by the firm of architect and former convict James Blackburn. Being a swing bridge, it could pivot out of the way to allow ships to pass. In the late 1870s, the Launceston-Hobart Railway called for modifications to the causeway so they could lay tracks over it. The causeway required widening and the swing bridge was modified as well.\n\nOn 22 July 1886, a train from the north was passing over the bridge when the engine left the tracks and tipped over, hanging precariously above the water on the edge of the southern end of the swing bridge. The fireman and driver were injured, but no one was killed and the locomotive was salvageable. The cause of the accident was found to be that the rails failed to match properly when the bridge was closed, so the bridge was modified again to solve this problem. The bridge lasted several decades more before being replaced by another swing bridge in the early 1900s. The pivot and the sandstone abutments of this bridge are still standing and can be viewed on the left of the present bridge as one travels towards the north.\n\nBoth the first and second swing bridges did not run straight off the end of the causeway; rather, they turned slightly to the right. The second swing bridge was left standing when the present lifting bridge was being constructed to prevent traffic stoppages, so the present bridge deviates from the causeway quite appreciably.\n\nConstruction on the present steel vertical lift bridge across the Derwent began in 1939. It was briefly interrupted by World War II, but was finally completed in 1946. It consists of a long concrete bridge that leads off the end of the causeway, and a steel lifting section just before the northern bank of the river. The lifting section is one of only a few remaining in the Southern Hemisphere, and is the largest of its kind remaining in Australia. The bridge was designed to last a century without replacement. A small control house stands on the lifting section. Inside are the switches and locks which operate the bridge.\n\nUntil 1984, the Australian Newsprint Mills (now Norske Skog Paper) at Boyer, near New Norfolk, upstream from Bridgewater, moved all its produce by river. Many barges were used to transport paper from the mill to the storage sheds at Pavilion Point at Hobart, and for this reason the bridge was required to open very frequently. Consequently, a bridge-keeper lived on-site and opened and closed the bridge when required. However, when the decision was made to cease river transportation, an on-site keeper was no longer necessary, so although the bridge can and does still open, bridge openings are now infrequent.\n\nIn response to vandalism of the house which contains the bridge operating controls, closed-circuit television cameras were installed along the lifting span sometime between 2003 and 2005.\n\nOn 30 October 2006 a fault was found in one of the steel cables holding up the two concrete counterweights above the road, forcing the temporary closure of the bridge. This closure caused peak hour traffic delays, mainly along the East Derwent Highway, due to traffic being diverted over the Bowen and Tasman bridges. The cables, which were put in place in 1994, were supposed to have a 20-year lifespan, and as they have lasted barely over half that time.\n\nThe bridge received an Engineering Heritage Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2005, the Australian Government granted 100 million towards the replacement of the Bridgewater Bridge, soon after the Tasmanian Government decided to build the replacement to the south of the existing bridge. However, after years of inaction the State government has encountered some heritage issues with replacing the bridge and is now to be replaced as part of the final stage of the Brighton Bypass and Midland Highway upgrade.\n\nTowards the end of 2010, the State government released plans for a new Derwent River crossing, next to the current bridge. The new bridge, when complete, will carry the Midland Highway and the old bridge will be left open for rail, pedestrian and local traffic. While the Bridgewater Bridge is recognised as being limited in its ability to perform the function of the Midland Highway, it also has important heritage values and is recognised as a landmark in the area.\n\nFrom 2006 until 2010, the lifting segment of the Bridgewater Bridge was out of commission, due to failed maintenance. The State Government spent $14 million to refurbish the bridge and provide it with a further 15 years of life, until a replacement can be built. This refurbishment replaced the vandalised control house and its controls and all of the cabling to raise and lower the bridge. Touted as a \"major tourist attraction\" with expected regular openings for tourist and private vessels to travel between Hobart and , the bridge refurbishment has been a major embarrassment to the Tasmanian Government. It has opened no more than six times successfully and has caused major traffic delays, including on a well-promoted occasion the lift span raised approximately and was stuck in that position for several minutes before being lowered again.\n\nIn March 2016, Infrastructure Tasmania published its review of a design and cost estimate for the construction of a replacement structure for the existing Bridgewater Bridge, which considered various options for a replacement structure and provided advice as to the most feasible crossing solution. As part of the 2018-19 federal budget, the Australian Government announced a $461 million grant towards the construction of a new Bridgewater Bridge, representing 80 per cent of the expected total construction cost. The Tasmanian Government is expected to contribute $115 million. Construction was expected to commence in 2019; however, following independent assessment of the project by Infrastructure Australia in July 2019, the evaluation identified a range of issues, which may add to costs and require further work to address, and recommended that the Tasmanian Government revise its business case. The project is scheduled to start design and approvals in 2019, with the design to be agreed by the end of 2020. Substantive construction is expected to commence in 2022 and completion is targeted in 2024. The concrete box girder bridge is expected to carry dual carriageways with a clearance of above the Derwent River.\n\n"}

In the film, John Travolta played \"Tod\", a teenage boy who lived in a sterile bubble due to illness. DeVita was 14 when the film, unauthorized by his family, was released. In 2004, the story of DeVita's life, illness, death, and the lasting impact of these events on his family was examined in a memoir by his younger sister, Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn, entitled \"The Empty Room: Surviving the Loss of a Brother or Sister at Any Age\".\n\nTed DeVita was the son of NIH oncologist and researcher Vincent T. DeVita, Jr., MD, who diagnosed his son's illness in 1972. Severe aplastic anemia is a rare disease in which the body is suddenly unable to produce new blood cells and platelets. Its victims have no effective immune system and must be protected from infection. DeVita was admitted to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. While scientists and physicians tried all known treatments for his condition, DeVita was isolated in Building 10, in a \"laminar airflow room\". This specialized room on \"13-East\" had been created in 1969 to protect leukemia patients whose immune systems had been compromised by chemotherapy. Physicians hoped the sterile room and frequent blood transfusions would sustain him until he recovered spontaneously or an effective treatment was found.\n\nThe \"laminar airflow room\" gave DeVita a living space the size of a normal bedroom. He was able to walk around and participate in many normal activities, but could be touched only with gloved hands. He lived surrounded by plastic sheeting containing a door-sized space through which sterilized objects, including food, clothing, and books, and occasionally doctors and nurses, could pass in and out. He was surrounded by a \"curtain\" of air, a steady outflow of positive air pressure to expel potential pathogens.\n\nHis family recalls DeVita as a bright and curious boy who grew to be a strong-willed teenager. DeVita's emotional adjustment to the confinement and isolation was difficult. From a later review of medical notes, his younger sister, Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn, learned the staff saw DeVita as alternately \"hostile, angry, and cheery\". Especially during the first year, he indulged in tantrums, throwing things out of the sterile area in his room, and creating a cavity in the wall to hide thousands of his hated pills. On the few occasions DeVita left his room, he was enclosed in a spacesuit and helmet, with an air pump that expelled pathogens. The suit drew so much attention that he rarely chose to leave. His sister remembers that the only time DeVita was not stared at was at a \"Star Trek\" convention.\n\nTed DeVita died in 1980 at NIH Hospital in Bethesda. His death was not primarily due to aplastic anemia, but was caused by iron overload from too many transfusions. Treatment for DeVita's disease is much more successful today, with a cure rate of up to 80 percent of aplastic anemia patients. Bone marrow transplants, transfusions, iron chelating regimens, and brief periods in positive airflow rooms are used in treating these patients.\n\n\n"}

It has been influential and has spawned a series of similar texts tailored to individual languages, such as \"The Elements of C Programming Style\", \"The Elements of C# Style\", \"The Elements of Java(TM) Style\", \"The Elements of MATLAB Style\", etc.\n\nThe book is built on short examples from actual, published programs in programming textbooks. This results in a practical treatment rather than an abstract or academic discussion. The style is diplomatic and generally sympathetic in its criticism, and unabashedly honest as well— some of the examples with which it finds fault are from the authors' own work (one example in the second edition is from the first edition).\n\nIts lessons are summarized at the end of each section in pithy maxims, such as \"Let the machine do the dirty work\":\nModern readers may find it a shortcoming that its examples use older procedural programming languages (Fortran and PL/I) which are quite different from those popular today. Few of today's popular languages had been invented when this book was written. However, many of the book's points that generally concern stylistic and structural issues transcend the details of particular languages.\n\n\"Kilobaud Microcomputing\" stated that \"If you intend to write programs to be used by other people, then you should read this book. If you expect to become a professional programmer, this book is mandatory reading\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2076198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076198", "title": "Polygenism", "text": "Polygenism\n\nPolygenism is a theory of human origins which posits the view that the human races are of different origins (\"polygenesis\"). This view is opposite to the idea of monogenism, which posits a single origin of humanity. Modern scientific views no longer favor the polygenic model, with the monogenic \"Out of Africa\" theory and its variants being the most widely accepted models for human origins.\n\nMany oral traditions feature polygenesis in their creation stories. For example, Bambuti mythology and other creation stories from the pygmies of Congo state that the supreme God of the pygmies, Khonvoum, created three different races of humans separately out of three kinds of clay: one black, one white, and one red. In some cultures, polygenism in the creation narrative served as an etiological function. These narratives provided an explanation as to why other people groups exist who are not affiliated with their tribe. Moreover, distinctions made between the creation of foreign people groups and the tribe or ethnic group to which the creation myth pertains served to reinforce tribal or ethnic unity, the need to exercise wariness and caution when dealing with outsiders, or the unique nature of the relationship between that tribe and the deities of their religious system.\n\nAn example may be found in the creation myth of the Asmat people, a hunter-gatherer tribe situated along the south-western coast of New Guinea. This creation myth asserts that the Asmat themselves came into being when a deity placed carved wooden statues in a ceremonial house and began to beat a drum. The statues became living humans and began to dance. Some time later, a great crocodile attempted to attack this ceremonial house, but was defeated by the power of the deity. The crocodile was cut into several pieces and these were tossed in different directions. Each piece became one of the foreign tribes known to the Asmat.\n\nThe idea is also found in some ancient Greek and Roman literature. For example, the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate in his \"Letter to a Priest\" wrote that he believed Zeus made multiple creations of man and women. In his \"Against the Galilaens\" Julian presented his reasoning for this belief. Julian had noticed that the Germanics and Scythians (northern nations) were different in their bodies (i.e. complexion) to the Ethiopians. He therefore could not imagine such difference in physical attributes as having originated from common ancestry, and so maintained separate creations for different races.\n\nIn early classical and medieval geography the idea of polygenism surfaced because of the suggested possibility of there being inhabitants of the antipodes (Antichthones). These inhabitants were considered by some to have separate origins because of their geographical extremity.\n\nThe religion of the Ainu people claims that the ancestors of the Ainu people arrived on Earth from the skies separate from the other races. See Ainu creation myth.\n\nTraditionally, most Jews, Christians and Muslims have embraced monogenism in the form that all modern humans ultimately are descended from a single mating pair, named Adam and Eve. In this context, polygenism described all alternative explanations for the origin of humankind that involved more than two individual \"first people\". This definition of polygenism is still employed among some Creationists and within the Roman Catholic Church (see \"Humani generis\").\n\nWith the development of the evolutionary paradigm of human origins, it has become widely recognized within the scientific community that at no point did there exist a single \"first man\" and a single \"first woman\" who constituted the first true humans and to whom all lineages of modern humans ultimately converge. If Adam and Eve ever existed as distinct historical persons, they were members of a much larger population of the same species. However, a common scientific explanation of human origins asserts that the population directly ancestral to all modern humans remained united as a single population by constant gene flow. Therefore, on the level of the entire human population, this explanation of human origin is classified as monogenism. All modern humans share the same origin from this single ancestral population.\n\nModern polygenists do not accept either theological or scientific monogenism. They believe that the variation among human racial types cannot be accounted for by monogenism or by evolutionary processes occurring since the proposed recent African origin of modern humans. Polygenists reject the argument that human races must belong to a single species because they can interbreed. There are several polygenist hypotheses, including biblical creationist polygenism and polygenist evolution.\n\nTo make polygenism compatible with the Biblical account in the early chapters of the \"Book of Genesis\", some argument is needed to the effect that what is in the Bible is incomplete. Three standard positions are:\n\n\nIn Christian terms, polygenesis remained an uncommon Biblical interpretation until the mid-19th century, and was largely considered heretical; however, it has been pointed out by some modern scholars that, while Pre-Adamism was strongly rejected by most and deemed heretical, Co-Adamism was not received with the same degree of hostility.\n\nA major reason for the emergence of Biblical polygenism from around the 18th century was because it became noted that the number of races could not have developed within the commonly-accepted Biblical timeframe. Francis Dobbs (1750–1811), an eccentric member of the Irish Parliament, believed in a different kind of biblical polygenism. In his \"Concise View from History\" written in 1800 he maintained that there was a race resulting from a clandestine affair between Eve and the Devil (see Serpent Seed).\n\nPolygenism was heavily criticized in the early 20th century Roman Catholic Church, and especially by Pope Pius XII in the encyclical \"Humani generis\" (1950), on the grounds that polygenism is incompatible with the doctrine of Original Sin.\n\nPre-Adamism claims there were already races of humans living before the creation of Adam. It traces back to Isaac La Peyrère in the 17th century.\n\nCo-Adamism claims that there was more than one Adam – small groups of men, created at the same time in different places across the Earth – and therefore that the different races were separately created. The idea of co-Adamism has been traced back as far as Paracelsus in 1520. Other 16th century advocates of co-Adamism included Thomas Harriot and Walter Raleigh, who theorised a different origin for the Native Americans.\n\nIn 1591 Giordano Bruno argued that because no one could imagine that the Jews and the Ethiopians had the same ancestry, then God must have either created separate Adams or Africans were the descendants of pre-Adamite races.\n\nAn anonymous Biblical paper supporting co-Adamism was published in 1732 entitled \"Co-adamitae or an Essay to Prove the Two Following. Paradoxes, viz. I. That There Were Other Men Created at the Same time with Adam, and II. That the Angels did not fall\".\n\nHenry Home, Lord Kames was a believer in co-Adamism. Home believed God had created different races on Earth in separate regions. In his book \"Sketches on the History of Man\" in 1734 Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so that the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.\n\nCharles White was another advocate of co-Adamism, although he used less theology to support his views. White's \"Account of the Regular Gradation in Man\" in 1799, provided the empirical science for polygenism. White defended the theory of polygeny by refuting French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon's interfertility argument the theory that only the same species can interbreed – pointing to species hybrids such as foxes, wolves and jackals, which were separate groups that were still able to interbreed.\n\nCharles Hamilton Smith, a naturalist from England, was a polygenist: he believed races had been created separately. He published the book \"The Natural History of the Human Species\" in 1848. In the book he maintained that there had always been three fundamentally distinct human types: the Caucasian, the Mongolian and the Negro. He also referred to the polygenist Samuel George Morton's work in America. Samuel Kneeland wrote an 84-page introduction to the American edition of the book where he laid out evidence which supports polygenist creationism and that the Bible is entirely compatible with multiple Adams.\n\nJohn William Colenso, a theologian and biblical scholar, was a polygenist who believed in co-Adamism. Colenso pointed to monuments and artifacts in Egypt to debunk monogenist beliefs that all races came from the same stock. For example, Ancient Egyptian representations of races showed exactly how the races looked in his time. Egyptological evidence indicated the existence of remarkable permanent differences in the shape of the skull, bodily form, colour and physiognomy between different races which are difficult to reconcile with biblical monogenesis. Colenso believed that racial variation between races was so great, that there was no way in which all the races could have come from the same stock just a few thousand years ago. He was unconvinced that climate could change racial variation and also believed, in common with other biblical polygenists, that monogenists had interpreted the Bible wrongly.\n\nColenso said: \"It seems most probable that the human race, as it now exists, had really sprung from more than one pair\". Colenso denied that polygenism caused any kind of racist attitudes or practices; like many other polygenists he claimed monogenesis was the cause of slavery and racism. Colenso claimed that each race had sprung from a different pair of parents, and that all races were created equal by God.\n\nBiblical polygenists such as Colenso, Louis Agassiz, Josiah Clark Nott and George Gliddon maintained that many of the races on Earth, such as Africans and Asians, were not featured in the \"Table of Nations\" in Genesis 10. They argued that its authors' knowledge was limited to their own region. Nott in his books claimed this, and that the Bible does not concern the whole of the Earth's population. According to Nott, there are no verses in the Bible which support monogenism; and that the only passage the monogenists use is Acts 17:26, where (he wrote) the monogenists are wrong in their interpretation of this verse because the \"one blood\" of Paul's sermon only includes the nations he knew existed, which were local.\n\nAccording to Lansdown (2006), \"Polygenism, the concept of different human species, was heretical and 'atheistic'; it was embraced only by the most isolated and heterodox thinkers\". Atheist polygenism was most notably supported by Ephraim Squier (1821–1888). In Europe in the 19th century the general public had favored polygenism, as many believed it contradicted the Genesis account and thus was more scientific than religious monogenism.\n\nThe British atheist leader Charles Bradlaugh was also interested in the theory of polygenesis. He found it useful to undermine Genesis accounts of creation, but this did not mean he advocated racist policies.\n\nDuring the late 17th century and early 18th century many countries first began to encounter different races from other countries due to colonial expansion, discovery, overseas exploration and increases in trade routes. Because of the encounters with different races, many people could not believe that they had the same ancestry of other races, because of the extreme racial differences. Many explorers and scientists visited other countries to observe and study different races and write down their findings. Later they went back to their own countries to publish books and journals on their findings and claim that the evidence supported polygenism.\n\nPolygenists of the 18th century included Voltaire and David Hume. Voltaire in his 1734 book \"Traité de métaphysique\" wrote that \"Whites ... Negroes ... the z races are not descended from the same man\". Voltaire brought the subject up in his \"Essay on the Manner and Spirit of Nations and on the Principal Occurrences in History\" in 1756 (which was an early work of comparative history). He believed each race had separate origins because they were so racially diverse. Voltaire found biblical monogenism laughable, as he expressed:\n\nIt is a serious question among them whether the Africans are descended from monkeys or whether the monkeys come from them. Our wise men have said that man was created in the image of God. Now here is a lovely image of the Divine Maker: a flat and black nose with little or hardly any intelligence. A time will doubtless come when these animals will know how to cultivate the land well, beautify their houses and gardens, and know the paths of the stars: one needs time for everything.\n\nWhen comparing Caucasians to those with dark skin, Voltaire claimed they were different species:\n\nThe negro race is a species of men different from ours as the breed of spaniels is from that of greyhounds. The mucous membrane, or network, which nature has spread between the muscles and the skin, is white in us and black or copper-colored in them.\n\nJohn Atkins, an English naval surgeon, was one of the earliest scientists to be a proponent of the polygenist theory. In his book \"A Voyage to Guinea\" (1723) he said \"I am persuaded that the black and white race have sprung from different coloured parents.\"\n\nIn the last two decades of the 18th century polygenism was advocated in England by historian Edward Long and anatomist Charles White, in Germany by ethnographers Christoph Meiners and Georg Forster, and in France by Julien-Joseph Virey.\n\nPolygenism was most widespread during the 19th century. The racial studies of Georges Cuvier, the French naturalist and zoologist, influenced scientific polygenism and scientific racism. These theories proposed a graduation from ‘civilisation’ to ‘barbarism’, at once justifying the European acquisition of foreign territories and highlighting the belief in the singular role of the Europeans as a civilizing force.\n\nGeorges Cuvier, a French naturalist and zoologist, believed there were three distinct races: the Caucasian (\"white\"), the Mongolian (\"yellow\") and the Ethiopian (\"black\"). Cuvier claimed Adam and Eve were Caucasian, forming the original race of mankind, while the other two races originated by survivors escaping in different directions after a major catastrophe hit the Earth 5,000 years ago, with those survivors then living in complete isolation from each other. Each race received marks for the beauty or ugliness of their skull and quality of their civilizations. According to Cuvier the white race was at the top and the black race was at the bottom.\n\nCuvier wrote regarding Caucasians:\n\nThe white race, with oval face, straight hair and nose, to which the civilised people of Europe belong and which appear to us the most beautiful of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage and activity.\n\nRegarding those he termed \"Ethiopian,\" Cuvier wrote:\n\nThe Negro race ... is marked by black complexion, crisped of woolly hair, compressed cranium and a flat nose, The projection of the lower parts of the face, and the thick lips, evidently approximate it to the monkey tribe: the hordes of which it consists have always remained in the most complete state of barbarism.\n\nCuvier's racial studies held the main features of polygenism, which are as follows:\n\n\nScientific polygenism became popular in France in the 1820s in response to James Cowles Prichard's \"Researches into the Physical History of Man\" (1813) which was considered a pioneering work of monogenism. An anthropological school advocating polygenism arose to counter Prichard's monogenism in France. Key French polygenists of this period included the naturalist Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent and Louis-Antoine Desmoulins (1796–1828), a student of Georges Cuvier.\n\nAnders Retzius, a Swedish professor of anatomy, was a polygenist. Retzius studied many different skull types, and because the skulls were so different he believed that the races had a separate origin.\n\nPolygenist schools arose in the 1830s and 1840s across Europe. The Scottish anatomist and zoologist Robert Knox was considered to have influenced polygenism in Britain; he argued in his \"The Races of Men\" (1850) that \"[r]acial natures ... were unchanging over thousands of years, and were so different that they should be called different species\". A colleague of Knox, James Hunt, was also an early author who promoted polygenism in Britain, though he was more concerned with establishing white superiority. Hunt dedicated his \"On the Negro's Place in Nature\" (1863) to Knox who had died a year before its publication.\n\nJohn Crawfurd, a Scottish physician and colonial administrator, was a polygenist. He studied the geography of where different races were located, and believed that different races had been created separately by God in specific regional zones for climatic circumstance.\n\nCharles Caldwell was one of the earliest supporters of polygenism in America. Caldwell attacked the position that environment was the cause of racial differences and argued instead that four races, Caucasian, Mongolian, American Indian, and African, were four different species, created separately by God.\n\nCharles Pickering (naturalist) was a librarian and curator of the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1843, he traveled to Africa and India to research human races. In 1848, Pickering published \"Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution\", which enumerated eleven races.\n\nPolygenism came into mainstream scientific thought in America in the mid 19th century with the work of several corresponding natural scientists such as Samuel George Morton and Charles Pickering as well as Egyptologist George Gliddon, the surgeon Josiah Clark Nott and more prominently the paleontologist and geologist Louis Agassiz in the United States. All had contributed to a major ethnological work of 738 pages entitled \"Types of Mankind\" which was published in 1854 and was a great success; it was followed by a sequel \"Indigenous Races of the Earth\" (1857). These works sparked the first formal Polygenist vs. Monogenist debates across America, and advocates of the polygenism school became known as pluralists. Since Louis Agassiz backed the pluralists, polygenism received mainstream public approval and wide exposure during the 1840s-1860s. Numerous articles promoting polygenist views were published in the \"American Journal of Science and Arts\" during this time period.\n\nThe archeologist Ephraim George Squier helped Morton's polygenism by excavating an ancient cranium from the midwestern mounds and sending a drawing of it to Morton. Morton found its similarities striking to Central and South American crania, confirming his belief that the American Indian nations had a common and indigenous origin. Morton's polygenism explicitly stated the Mound Builders were an American Indian race of great antiquity, they did not migrate from Asia, and their physical form has remained essentially unchanged in their descendants. Both Squier and Gliddon demonstrated for Morton the permanence of racial characteristics, and the suitability of each race to the region for which it had been created.\n\nAmerican Indians supported Morton's conclusions, whilst some white archaeologists supported Morton. Others such as William Pidgeon did not accept Morton's conclusions because at the time some white archaeologists such as Pidgeon could not believe that Native Americans had created the archaeological remains they saw around them; instead William Pidgeon wrote a book called \"Traditions of Dee-Coo-Dah and Antiquarian Researches\" in 1858. In the book Pidgeon attempts to prove that a vanished race, culturally superior to and existing earlier than the American Indians, occupied America first and that The Mound Builders were not Native Americans. Pidgeon's book was revealed mostly to be a hoax. The famed archaeologist Theodore H. Lewis later revealed that Pidgeon had fabricated most of his research and distorted much of the rest of it, mapping mounds where none existed and changing the arrangement of existing mound groups to suit his needs. Morton's work gained more support because his work was considered to be evidence of true objective science unlike others such as Pidgeon. Morton won his reputation as the great data-gatherer and objectivist of American Science. Oliver Wendell Holmes praised Morton for \"the severe and cautious character\" of his works, which \"from their very nature are permanent data for all future students of ethnology\".\n\nBy 1850 Agassiz had developed a unique form of co-Adamism. God he believed had created several different zoological provinces with different races in them, but also fauna and animals specific to those regions. An essay of Agassiz promoting this theory with maps of the zoological zones was attached as a preface to \"Types of Mankind\" in collaboration with Morton, Gliddon, Nott and others. Agassiz's theory developed some support amongst Christians, and he often wrote articles in Christian magazines claiming his views on polygenism were compatible with the bible. Christian fundamentalists however who held to Young Earth Creationism and strict monogenism (i.e. everyone on Earth from Adam and Eve) attacked his views, as well as those of Gliddon and Nott.\n\nUnlike Josiah Nott, the slave-owner from Alabama, Agassiz was never a supporter of slavery. He claimed his views had nothing to do with politics.\n\nThe notion that races were separate and came together by hybridism, rather than being variations from a common stock, was cast into doubt with the publication of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" in 1859, which Agassiz opposed till his death. Yet the influence of polygenism persisted for many years. For example, the Hamitic Hypothesis, which argued that certain African populations were the descendants of a proto-white invasion in the ancient past, was influenced by polygenism and continued to hold sway in linguistics and anthropology until the 1950s. Darwin did not address man's origin directly at this stage, and the argument continued for a number of years, with the creation of the Anthropological Society of London in 1863 in the shadow of the American civil war, in opposition to the abolitionist Ethnological Society. The Anthropologicals had the Confederate agent Henry Hotze permanently on their council. The two societies did not heal their differences until they merged in 1871 to form the Anthropological Institute.\n\nGeorges Pouchet, the French naturalist and anatomist, was a polygenist. Pouchet made contributions in several scientific fields, and specialised in comparative anatomy of fishes and whales. He was a prime advocate of polygeny, and was the author of an anthropological work titled\" De la Pluralité des Races Humaines\" (1858), which was translated into English as \"The Plurality of the Human Race\" in 1864 by the Anthropological Society.\n\nJohn Thurnam with Joseph Barnard Davis published a work in two volumes under the title of \"Crania Britannica\" in 1865, important for craniometry. Thurnam and Davis were both believers in polygenism, in the form that different races had been created separately. Davis was a collector of crania, and had over 1700 specimens. Because of the racial differences of the crania, Davis and Thurnam believed that proofs of polygenism were to be found in studying the skull types of different races. Davis also wrote \"Thesaurus craniorum: catalogue of the skulls of the various races of man\" (1875).\n\nAlthough it took many years, polygenism, which required species to be created in specific geographic locations and to remain immutable, has been almost entirely replaced among scientists by Darwin's theory of evolution from a common ancestor. Persistent antagonism to Darwinian theory is today primarily a matter of religious or political viewpoint.\n\nPolygenist evolution is the belief that humans evolved independently from separate species of apes. This can be traced back to Carl Vogt in 1864. Polygenist evolution allowed polygenists to link each race to an altogether different ape. This was shown in the work of Hermann Klaatsch and F. G. Crookshank.\n\nCarl Vogt believed that the inhabitants of Africa were related to the ape, and was separate from those of European descent. In Chapter VII of his \"Lectures of man\" (1864) he compared both ethnicities, describing them as \"two extreme human types\". The difference between them, he claimed, are greater than those between two species of ape; and this proves the two are a separate species altogether.\n\nIn an unusual blend of contemporary evolutionary thinking and pre-Adamism, the theistic evolutionist and geologist Alexander Winchell argued in his 1878 book \"Adamites and Preadamites\" for the pre-Adamic origins of the human race on the basis that Africans were too racially inferior to have developed from the Biblical Adam. Winchell also believed that the laws of evolution operated according to the will of God.\n\nBefore Darwin published his theory of evolution and common descent in his \"Origin of Species\" (1859), scientific theories or models of Polygenism (such as Agassiz's) were strictly creationist. Even after Darwin's book was published, Agassiz still stuck to his scientific form of polygenist creationism and denounced the idea of evolution. However, by the late 19th century most scientific polygenists had abandoned Agassiz's creationism and began to embrace polygenist forms of evolution. This even included many students of Agassiz, including Nathaniel Shaler, who had studied under Agassiz at Harvard. Shaler continued to believe in polygenism, but believed the different races evolved from different primates. The prominent French anthropologist Paul Broca by 1878 had also converted from creationist polygenism to accepting a form of polygenist evolution.\n\nIn his work \"The Descent of Man\" (1871), Charles Darwin and some of his supporters argued for the monogenesis of the human species, seeing the common origin of all humans as essential for evolutionary theory. This is known as the single-origin hypothesis. Darwin even dedicated a chapter of his \"The Descent of Man\" to an attempt to refute the polygenists and support common ancestry of all races. Polygenist evolution views however continued into the early 20th century, and still found support amongst prominent scientists. Henry Fairfield Osborn for example in his \"The Origin and Evolution of Life\" (1916) claimed blacks and whites both evolved from different primates.\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace was also an advocate of polygenist evolution, claiming that the physical differences in races must have occurred at such a remote time in the past before humans had any intelligence, when natural selection was still operative on human bodies. The differentiation into separate races with distinct physical traits must have happened so soon after humans had just appeared on Earth that for all practical purposes all races had always been distinct.\n\nIn contrast to most of Darwin's supporters, Ernst Haeckel put forward a doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist and polygenist August Schleicher, in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman Urmenschen, which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. Haeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction.\n\nHaeckel claimed that Africans have stronger and more freely movable toes than any other race, which he interpreted as evidence that members of the race were closely related to apes. Reasoning that apes use their toes to cling tightly to tree branches, Haeckel compared Africans to \"four-handed\" apes. Haeckel also believed that Blacks were savages and that Whites were significantly more civilized.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a match-up between the champions of the previous year's Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana, South America's premier club competitions.\n\nThe competition has had several formats over its lifetime. Initially, the champions of the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Libertadores contested it. In 1998, the Supercopa Libertadores was discontinued and the \"Recopa\" went into a hiatus. The competition has been disputed with either a presently-used two-legged series or a single match-up at a neutral venue. Together with the aforementioned tournaments, a club has the chance to win the \"CONMEBOL Treble\" all in one year or season. However, if the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana are won by the same team, then according to the Copa Libertadores regulations Article 1.7, both competitions' runners-up will play one or two matches in order to decide the team which will play in the Recopa.\n\nThe most recent champion of the competition is Brazilian club Flamengo, after beating Independiente del Valle in the 2020 edition. Argentine club Boca Juniors is the most successful club in the cup history, having won the tournament four times. Brazilian clubs have accumulated the most victories with eleven wins while Brazil has the most different winning teams, with eight clubs having won the title. The cup has been won by 16 clubs and won consecutively by four clubs: Brazil's São Paulo, Ecuador's LDU Quito, Argentina's Boca Juniors and River Plate successfully defended the title in 1994, 2006, 2010 and 2016, respectively.\n\nWhen the Supercopa Sudamericana was created in 1988, a new continental Super Cup competition in South America became viable. CONMEBOL named the new competition \"Recopa Sudamericana\" after the defunct Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes played in 1970 and 1971. The Recopa Sudamericana, disputed between the winners of South America's two premier club competitions, is not related chronologically to the Recopa Sudamericana, created in 1968 which was contested between former South American winners of the Intercontinental Cup, Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes, disputed among Cup winners of South America. The first edition was played in 1989 and pitted Uruguayan club Nacional and Argentinian side Racing. Played on two legs, Nacional managed to win the trophy after winning 4–1 on points. Due to schedule dilemmas and political issues, the 1990 edition was played in Miami between Atlético Nacional and Boca Juniors with the latter winning 0–1. Olimpia of Paraguay would win the Recopa Sudamericana without the need to dispute a match as the \"Decano\" won both the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana. CONMEBOL declared Olimpia the automatic winners of the 1991 competition.\n\nIn 1992, and from 1994 to 1997, the competition was played in Japan. Colo-Colo of Chile defeated Cruzeiro 5–4 on penalties after a 0–0 tie in the 1992 final. Staying true to the winning ways of the \"Paulista's\" golden generation, São Paulo won the 1993 and 1994 finals to become the first team to retain the title. Due to schedule congestion, the 1993 finals were played as part of the Campeonato Brasileiro and it also became the first \"Recopa\" to feature two teams from the same nation. In a second, consecutive all-Brazilian final, São Paulo successfully defended the trophy against Botafogo. Since São Paulo won both the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana, CONMEBOL had Copa CONMEBOL winners Botafogo dispute the Recopa Sudamericana only to lose 3–1 to the defending champions.\n\nArgentina managed to emulate their northern neighbors with the 1995 edition being an all-Argentinian affair. Independiente, led by Jorge Burruchaga, managed to consecrate themselves winners after defeating Carlos Bianchi's legendary Vélez Sársfield 1–0 in Tokyo. Independiente participated in a second, consecutive final only to lose the title to Grêmio after being defeated 4–1. The 1997 edition was won by a Vélez Sársfield team that bowed out from the international limelight with their last title. Having failed to win the trophy in 1992 and 1993, Cruzeiro comfortably won the 1998 edition that was played as part of the Copa Mercosur. This final series was played two years after the participating teams won their corresponding qualifying tournaments.\n\nAt the end of the 1998 season, CONMEBOL discontinued the Supercopa Sudamericana. As a result of not having an important, secondary tournament, the Recopa Sudamericana went into a hiatus from 1999 until 2002. However, the introduction of the new Copa Sudamericana revitalized the competition with Olimpia winning the 2003 final in Los Angeles. Played on a neutral venue for the second year in a row, Cienciano defeated Boca Juniors on penalties to win their second international title. From 2005 onwards, the Recopa Sudamericana would be played on a home-and-away basis.\n\nIn a rematch of the Copa Libertadores final of 2004, Boca Juniors avenged that defeat as they beat Once Caldas 4–3 on aggregate. A year later, Boca Juniors faced São Paulo, both two-time winners of the competition, in order to determine who would become the first . The \"Xeneizes\" won 4–1 on points and successfully defended the title, becoming the first side since Telê Santana's São Paulo to win consecutive \"Recopas\". Internacional became the first Brazilian side to lift the trophy in nine years. The 2008 competition saw Boca Juniors win their fourth title to become joint leaders for most international titles won by a club in a last hurrah on the international scene. LDU Quito won their second international title as they thumped Internacional 6–0 on points and 4–0 on goal aggregate to win their first ever title. LDU Quito then successfully defended their title in 2010 against Estudiantes. They became the third team to successfully defend the title.\n\nUnlike most other competitions around the world, the Recopa Sudamericana do not use extra time, an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw, or away goals, a method of breaking ties in football and other sports when teams play each other twice, once at each team's home ground, to decide a tie that was level on aggregate.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1995, teams would be awarded 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss). From 1995 onwards, the \"three points for a win\" standard, a system adopted by FIFA in 1995 that places additional value on wins, was adopted in CONMEBOL, with teams now earning 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss. If both teams are level on points after two legs, goal difference would come into play. Penalty kicks was used to determine a winner if the match was tied on goal difference.\n\nSince the competition takes place in the mid-winter, it's disputed between the champions of the previous year's aforementioned competitions. Because of this, some count the year of the championship by the qualification year rather than that of the competition itself. Thus, CONMEBOL states that Nacional from Uruguay won the first Recopa of 1989, whereas the RSSSF refers to that championship as Recopa 1988.\n\nThe Recopa Sudamericana trophy is retained by CONMEBOL at all times. A full-size replica trophy is awarded to the winning club. Thirty gold medals are presented to the winning club and thirty silver medals to the runners-up.\n\nThe Recopa Sudamericana trophy has not undergone many changes in its history. The trophy consists of a gold-coated body with a pedestal. The body consists of an Adidas Tango ball, a successful family and brand of association footballs. It was first introduced as the \"Tango Durlast\" in 1978 for the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. The ball is hoisted by a golden, cylindrical body with four quadrilateral edges sticking out of the body at 45 degrees from each other. The pedestal is separated into two parts; the top part of the pedestal consists of the CONMEBOL emblem. The bottom part of the pedestal contains a gold badge underneath the CONMEBOL emblem with the phrase, \"RECOPA\", imprinted into it. To the left and right, badges of previous winners are placed.\n\nA team which wins 3 times in a row, receives an original copy of the trophy and a special mark of recognition.\n\nThe current match ball for the Recopa Sudamericana, manufactured by Nike, is named the \"Total 90 Omni CSF\". It is one of the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the \"Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis\" in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration. Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.\n\nLike the FIFA World Cup, the Recopa Sudamericana is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations. Unlike the premier football tournament forementioned, the competition uses a single, main sponsor; it is currently primarily sponsored by Banco Santander, one of the largest banks in the world. The deal running for a period of three years began with the 2012 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition will carry the name of the bank. Thus, the competition is known officially as the '\"Copa Santander Libertadores'\". The first primary sponsor of the competition was Fox Sports Latinoamérica, a Latin American cable television network focusing on sports-related programming including live and pre-recorded event telecasts, sports talk shows, and other original programmings. The sponsorship was only for the 2005 edition of the competition, being known officially as '\"Fox Sports Recopa Sudamericana\"'. The second primary sponsor was Visa, an American multinational financial services corporation. The deal ran for a period of 3 years which began with the 2006 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition carried the name of the corporation. Thus, the competition was known officially as '\"Recopa Visa Sudamericana\"'.\n\nHowever, the competition has had many secondary sponsors that invest in the tournament as well. Many of these sponsors are nationally based but have expanded to other nations. Nike supplies the official match ball, as they do for all other CONMEBOL competitions. Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising, even if such sponsors conflict with those of the Recopa Sudamericana.\n\nThe tournament's current secondary sponsors and brands advertised (in \"italic\") are:\n\nArgentines Leonardo Ponzio, Sebastián Battaglia, Neri Cardozo, Rodrigo Palacio, and Jesús Dátolo, Uruguayan Camilo Mayada and Paraguayan Claudio Morel Rodríguez are the only players to have won three Recopa Sudamericana winners' medals. The overall top goalscorer in Recopa Sudamericana history is Rodrigo Palacio, scorer of five goals. Leandro Damião is second with 3 goals. Rodrigo Palacio and Leandro Damião hold the record for the most goals scored in a single Recopa Sudamericana. Each of their three goals was scored in the 2006 and 2010 finals, respectively. Claudio Morel Rodríguez is the player with most appearances in the competition, 5 editions (winning three finals), all of them in Boca Juniors with the exception of 2003 (played for San Lorenzo). Paraguayan Julio César Cáceres, Argentine Jesús Dátolo and Brazilian André are the only players that won the Recopa Sudamericana with two teams. Cáceres won in 2003 with Olimpia and 2008 with Boca Juniors, Dátolo won in 2006 and 2008 with Boca and in 2014 with Atlético Mineiro, and André won in 2012 with Santos and 2014 with Atlético Mineiro.\n\nArgentinian Marcelo Gallardo is the only head coach to ever win three Recopa Sudamericana. Brazilians Telê Santana and Levir Culpi, Uruguayan Luis Cubilla, and Argentinian Alfio Basile are the only head coaches to ever win two Recopa Sudamericana. All Recopa Sudamericana winning head coaches were natives of the country they coached to victory except for Cubilla, Mirko Jozić, Jorge Fossati and Edgardo Bauza. Croatian Jozić, who won the 1992 edition with Chile's Colo-Colo, has the distinction and honor of being the only non-South American coach to win the tournament.\n\n\n"}

J. Poncet, who passed through Sennar in 1699, left this description of his interview with King Badi:\n\nPoncet's departure from Sennar was delayed at the border for 19 days until 11 June 1699, due to the death of King Badi's mother. A Jesuit residing at Port Said, Jean Verzaeu, wrote on 20 October 1700 that the kingdom and Ethiopia were at war over the assassination of a Sennar national in Ethiopia, and that the trade route between the two countries was closed.\n\nBecause of the success of Poncet's visit to Ethiopia, Charles de Maillet, the French consul at Cairo, ordered Lenoir de Roule to visit the Ethiopian Emperor on behalf of Louis XIV. Due to the hostility of the natives of the lands he travelled through, de Roule was unable to get any further than Sennar, where he was murdered with his five companions before the royal palace on November 10, 1705. Although King Badi was seen by many as being responsible for this act, the Scots traveller James Bruce, who travelled through Sennar later in the eighteenth century, accused the Franciscans of having manipulated the events that led to these deaths.\n"}

They were formed in response to the housing crisis precipitated by large numbers of houses being bought by wealthy English people for use as holiday homes, pushing up house prices beyond the means of many locals. They were responsible for setting fire to English-owned holiday homes in Wales from 1979 to the mid-1990s.\n\nThe group first came to prominence in 1979. In the first wave of attacks, eight English-owned holiday homes were destroyed within the space of a month. In 1980 Welsh Police carried out a series of raids in Operation Tân in an effort to find the culprits. Within the next ten years around 220 properties were damaged by the campaign. It peaked in the late 1980s with the targeting of Conservative MPs' homes and David Hunt, the then Welsh secretary, was a target in 1990.\n\nResponsibility for the bombings had been taken by four separate movements: Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (\"the movement to defend Wales\"), Cadwyr Cymru (\"the keepers of Wales\"), Meibion Glyndŵr, and the Welsh Army for the Workers Republic (WAWR), whose attacks were on political targets in the early 1980s. Meibion Glyndŵr was the only group to have any claim to long-term success, although since the mid-1990s the group has been inactive, and Welsh nationalist violence has ceased, at least on an organisational level. Letters claiming responsibility for attacks were signed \"Rhys Gethin\", in homage to one of Owain Glyndŵr's most prominent followers.\n\nA reinvestigation into postal bombings led to the conviction of Sion Aubrey Roberts in 1993. A Plaid Cymru member of parliament, Elfyn Llwyd, speculated that the group was an MI5 front.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is also the president of the Biju Janata Dal, a writer and has authored three books. As of 2019, he is one of the longest-serving chief minister of any Indian state, holding the post for almost two decades, and only the third Indian chief Minister after Pawan Chamling and Jyoti Basu to win five consecutive terms as Chief Minister of an Indian state.\n\nPatnaik was born on 16 October 1946 in Cuttack to Biju Patnaik, former Chief Minister of Odisha, and his Punjabi wife, Gyan. Patnaik was educated at the Welham Boys' School in Dehradun, and later the prestigious The Doon School. After that he attended St. Stephen College, Delhi University, and he qualified for Bachelor of Arts degree.\nPatnaik is a writer and had for most part of his youth been away from both politics and Odisha, but after his father Biju Patnaik's demise, he entered politics in 1997 and a year later founded the Biju Janata Dal, named after Biju Patnaik, which won the state election with the BJP as its alliance and formed the government in which Patnaik became Chief Minister. His mild mannerism, \"Stand against corruption\" and \"Pro-poor policies\" have resulted in the development of a huge support base in Odisha, which has voted him to power in the last five consecutive terms. Like his father, he has managed to control the bureaucracy and transformed it into a machine for the development of the state.\n\nAfter the death of his father Biju Patnaik, leader of the Janata Dal, he was elected as a member to the 11th Lok Sabha in the by-election from Aska Parliamentary Constituency in Odisha, India. He was a member of the Consultative Committee of Ministry of Steel & Mines, Member of Standing Committee on Commerce, and Member Library Committee of Parliament. A year later the Janta Dal split and Patnaik founded the Biju Janta Dal which in alliance with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) performed well and Patnaik was selected the Union Minister for Mines in the cabinet of A.B.Vajpayee.\n\nIn 2000 Assembly election, BJD won the majority of seats in alliance with the BJP in the Odisha Assembly elections, Patnaik resigned from the Union cabinet and was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Odisha.\n\nBJP led NDA lost the general elections in 2004, however, the coalition led by Naveen Patnaik emerged victorious in the state legislative elections and he continued as the Chief Minister. During this tenure, the friction between the ruling partners was getting more and more apparent, especially after the killing of Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati in the Kandhamal district of Odisha in 2007–2008 and also active participation of Bajrang Dal in the riots that hit Kandhamal region.\n\nIn the run-up to the polls for the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly of Odisha elections in 2009, BJD walked out of the NDA after severing ties with the BJP and joined the nascent Third Front constituted mainly by the Left Front and few regional parties. He did it after severely criticising BJP's involvement in Kandhamal anti-Christian riots during 2007. The BJD won a resounding victory in both the Vidhan Sabha (State Assembly) as well as the Lok Sabha elections in 2009, winning 14 out of 21 Lok Sabha seats and 103 of the 147 assembly seats and was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Odisha on 21 May 2009 for the third consecutive term.\n\nPatnaik won a huge victory in both the 2014 Indian general elections and the Legislative Assembly of Odisha elections in 2014. Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal secured 20 out of the 21 Lok Sabha seats of Odisha and 117 of the 147 Odisha Vidhan Sabha seats.\n\nDespite a strong BJP wave across the country, the Biju Janata Dal, under the leadership of Naveen Patnaik won as many as 112 seats out of 146 (polls for 1 was deferred) in the Legislative Assembly of Odisha and 12 out of 21 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 Indian general elections\n\nPatnaik spent most of his early days away from Odisha, so he has problems with writing and speaking fluently in Odia language. He is the only chief minister of India who does not speak the regional language of his state and because of this he has been facing severe criticism from his opponents. However, he possesses great mastery over Hindi, French, Punjabi and English. At rallies, he delivers Odia speeches written in Roman alphabet. A book named \"Naveen Patnaik\" was authored by Ruben Banerjee\n\nThe United Nations has complimented Naveen Patnaik for his government's proposal of 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and the state Assemblies.\n\n"}

He studied at the Denver College of Music with Edwin Stringham and at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, with Howard Hanson and Bernard Rogers. On September 17, 1928, he married Alberta Phillips (who wrote many of his librettos; died 1979). The couple had a daughter, Ann (b. 1931; actress Ann E. Todd, later Ann Basart) and a son, Stephen (1937–1986), who predeceased his father. Due to privations caused by the Great Depression, the children, Ann and Stephen, were raised by their maternal grandparents.\n\nPhillips's first important work was \"Selections from McGuffey's Reader\", for orchestra, based on poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. . He wrote of this work in his 1933 diary, \"I don't think anybody had written such 'American-sounding' music before. On the first night, the students said it was corny. And it was. But I didn't care, because it was a huge success.\"\n\nIn his 1943 diaries, he looked back at his \"Courthouse Square\" (1935) and is struck by \"the poor scoring and the clichés and triviality of the material. There is almost self-conscious simplicity, not to say idiocy, about it. Too sweet, although the vitality of rhythm is there. But it wasn't a bad way to begin a career.\"\n\nBy the 1940s he had turned to a more astringent and expressive idiom . In 1942, he wrote in his diary, \"I have decided that my slow movements from now on are going to be different; they are going to play for keeps and not just be soft, sensuous, tender, delicious, delicate, dramatic, or dark. No more warm middle-western summer-night scenes, but the cool, stormy, volcanic, passionate stretches of the soul.\" He commented in his 1944 diary, \"I want something with more bite to it, with an ache and some force. I want the structure of this work to be evident. I want to use some of the elements of the mind in working it out, such as fugue, passacaglia, etc. I want to write with humor or wit in some parts—another function of mind. The underlying emotional warmth, however, must always be there.\"\n\nIn 1960 his String Quartet Number Two was premiered at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. by the Paganini Quartet, with the composer present, and broadcast on live FM radio. In the early 1960s he turned to free serial techniques, less sharply accented rhythms, and increasing fantasy . In his 1987 diaries, he wrote, \"Yesterday, I read about [Elliott] Carter's Double Concerto for piano and harpsichord. I find I am developing a type of chordal structure similar to his, but I never knew anything about this phase of his before reading about it. I certainly don't feel attracted to his rhythmic style, but the widespread open distribution of intervals in the chords & the cluster forms & inversions are very much what I have been doing. I hadn't, until lately, done anything to arrive at a new chordal style because of my predominant drive for linear motion, thematic or contrapuntal.\"\nHe wrote, in 1983, of his musical influences: \"The first music of a serious nature I was introduced to as a child was the 2- and 3-part inventions of Bach. Then Haydn and Chopin. All of these are simple and clear, and their harmonic content is not obscured by an elaborate overlay of either contrapuntal virtuosity or chromatic sugaring. After college I emerged with a fairly self-recognized set of preferences: Scarlatti, Soler, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Debussy, Stravinsky—all those whose attitude toward the sonic portion of music is one of making things clear and strong-flavored.\"\n\nPhillips taught composition and theory at Eastman (1933–49), the University of Illinois (1949–64), the Juilliard School of Music (1968–69), and Cornell University (1972–73). His students include Jack Beeson, William Flanagan, Kenneth Gaburo, Ben Johnston, H. Owen Reed, Daria Semegen, Steven Stucky, David Ward-Steinman, and Charles Whittenberg , as well as Jerry Amaldev. He was a Fulbright Lecturer in Barcelona, Spain, in 1960–61, and received Guggenheim fellowships in 1942–43 and 1961–62 , when the entire Phillips family reunited in Paris.\n\nHe died in Berkeley, California on June 22, 1988, aged 80, of complications after a heart attack (; ).

It is one of the oldest musical instruments in China and has been in use for approximately seven thousand years. The xun was initially made of baked clay or bone, and later of clay or ceramic. It is the only surviving example of an earth (also called \"clay\") instrument from the traditional \"eight-tone\" (bayin) classifications of musical instruments (based on whether the instrument is made from metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, hide, or wood).\n\nThe xun is an egg-shaped aerophone, containing at least three finger holes in front and two thumb holes in back. It has a blowing hole on top and can have up to ten smaller finger holes, one for each finger. It is similar to an ocarina but does not contain a fipple mouthpiece, unlike other Chinese flute-like instruments, such as the Wudu and Taodi. The xun can come in a variety of sizes.\n\nThe entry for the Xun in the oldest surviving Chinese encyclopedia, \"Erya\" (Refined Definitions, c. 3rd century BC), describes it as being of two types:\n\n\nThe origin of this unique wind instrument dates back to the Stone Age and has much to do with early Chinese hunting practices. During ancient times, people often tied a stone or mud ball to the rope that was used for hunting wild animals. Some of the balls were hollow, which allowed it make many sounds when thrown. Most people found it enjoyable and learned how to blow air into it. Gradually, the \"stone meteor\" became the musical instrument we know as \"xun\".\n\nArchaeologists have discovered vessel-flutes like the xun in common graves of the Xia dynasty. Those had three finger holes and could produce the notes do, mi, so, la and fa. The shape of the instrument and number of finger holes of the xun as we know it today were standardized during the Shang dynasty. Most xun of that era had five finger holes and produced sound of much better quality. They were able to produce all the tones and half-tones in a single octave.\n\nBy the Zhou dynasty, it was a common instrument and was played in the imperial courts. The design of the xun varied according to whether it was played for enjoyment or for celebrations.\n\nThe use of xun in the Chinese history was found mainly in the performance of palace music. However, the sound of xun is also associated as the symbol of respectable hermits, lady in sorrow, or heroes at the end of their strength, and is considered the best instrument to perform a heartbreaking tone, or to make solemn music within the royal court. The sound of xun represents a particular beauty, which combines with loneliness, desolate and elegance. It is the embodiment of the unique Chinese aesthetic conceptions. In a traditional Chinese orchestra, xun plays the important part of alto voice. Its soft, heavy voice makes high-pitch and low-pitch in a harmonious proportion. In this sense, xun represents also the idea of harmony, which is one of the main parts of traditional Chinese values.\n\nThe Erya (尔雅): \"A large xun is like a goose egg, with a flattened bottom and six holes; a small one is like a chicken egg\"\n\nClassic of Poetry (诗经): \"The elder brother plays xun, the younger brother plays chi [transverse flute]\"\n\nThe Korean equivalent is the \"hun\" (hangul: 훈; hanja: 塤). In Japan, the same type of instrument is called \"tsuchibue\" (hiragana: つちぶえ ; kanji: 土笛, lit. \"earthen flute\"). In Assam, it is known as Xutuli.\n\n"}

Cancer of the duodenum is relatively rare compared to stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. Its histology is usually adenocarcinoma.\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Gardner syndrome, Lynch syndrome, Muir–Torre syndrome, celiac disease, Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, Crohn's disease and juvenile polyposis syndrome are risk factors for developing this cancer.\n\nThe duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. It is located between the stomach and the jejunum. After foods combine with stomach acid, they descend into the duodenum where they mix with bile from the gallbladder and digestive fluid from the pancreas.\n\nThe cancerous mass tends to block food from getting to the small intestine. If food cannot get to the intestines, it will cause pain, acid reflux, and weight loss because the food cannot get to where it is supposed to be processed and absorbed by the body.\n\nPatients with duodenal cancer may experience abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nResection is sometimes a part of a treatment plan, but duodenal cancer is difficult to remove surgically because of the area that it resides in—there are many blood vessels supplying the lower body. Chemotherapy is sometimes used to try to shrink the cancerous mass. Other times intestinal bypass surgery is tried to reroute the stomach to intestine connection around the blockage.\n\nA 'Whipple' procedure is a type of surgery that is sometimes possible with this cancer. In this procedure, the duodenum, a portion of the Pancreas (the head), and the gall bladder are usually removed, the small intestine is brought up to the Pylorus (the valve at the bottom of the stomach) and the liver and pancreatic digestive enzymes and bile are connected to the small intestine below the pylorus.\n\nThe removal of part of the Pancreas often requires taking pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid digestion. These are available in the form of capsules by prescription.\n\nIt is not unusual for a people having received a Whipple procedure to feel well, and to lead a normal life. Some patients need to be fitted with tubes to either add nutrients (feeding tubes) or drainage tubes to remove excess processed food that can not pass the blockage.\n"}

It was used to contain perfume or oil, and is often depicted in vase paintings being used by athletes during bathing. In these depictions, the vessel is at times attached by a strap to the athlete's wrist, or hung by a strap from a peg on the wall.\n\nThe shape of the aryballos originally came from the oinochoe of the Geometric period of the 9th century BCE, a globe-shaped wine jar. By the Proto-Corinthian period of the following century, it had attained its definitive shape, going from spherical to ovoid to conical, and finally back to spherical. This definitive form has a wide, flat mouth, and a single small handle. Some later variations have bell-shaped mouths, a second handle, and/or a flat base. Potters also created inventive shapes for aryballoi.

In 1900, he graduated from St. Petersburg University and found work at the Petersburg Margarine Factory.\n\nStarting in 1902, Lebedev moved from university to university in Russia, starting at the Saint-Petersburg Institute for Railroad Engineering. In 1904, he returned to St. Petersburg University to work under Alexey Favorsky (Stalin Prize, 1941, for contributions to the manufacture of synthetic rubber). \n\nIn 1905, he married his second wife, the artist Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva.\n\nIn 1915, Lebedev was appointed Professor at the Women's Pedagogical Institute in St. Petersburg. After 1916, he was a Professor of the Saint Petersburg Academy for Military Medicine. In 1925, he became the leader of the \"Oil Laboratory\" (after 1928, the \"Laboratory of Synthetic Resins\") at St. Petersburg University.\n\nHe died in Leningrad and is interred in Tikhvin Cemetery.\n\nLebedev's main works are devoted to polymerisation of diene hydrocarbons. He was the first to research the polymerisation of butadiene (1910–1913). In 1910, Lebedev was the first to get synthetic rubber based on poly-butadiene. His book \"Research in polymerisation of by-ethylene hydrocarbons\" (1913) became the bible for studies of synthetic rubber.\n\nAfter 1914, he studied polymerisation of ethylene monomers, leading to modern industrial methods for manufacturing of butyl synthetic rubber and poly-isobutylene. Between 1926 and 1928, he developed a single-stage method for manufacturing butadiene out of ethanol. In 1928, he developed an industrial method for producing synthetic rubber based on polymerisation of butadiene using metallic sodium as a catalyst. This method became the base for the Soviet industry of synthetic rubber. The Soviets lacked reliable access to natural rubber, making the manufacture of synthetic rubber important. The first three synthetic rubber plants were launched in 1932–33. For butadiene production they used grain or potato ethanol as a feedstock. It caused a number of jokes about \"Russian method of making tires from potatoes\".\n\nBy 1940, the Soviet Union had the largest synthetic rubber industry in the world, producing more than 50,000 tons per year. During World War II, Lebedev's process of obtaining butadiene from ethyl alcohol was also used by the German rubber industry.\n\nAnother important contribution of Lebedev's was the study of the kinetics of hydrogenation of ethylene hydrocarbons and the development of a number of synthetic motor oils for aircraft engines.\n\n\n"}

Her sister is the Canadian television journalist Avery Haines and her brother is Tim Haines, owner of Bluestreak Records in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada.\n\nAfter settling in Fenelon Falls, Ontario at the age of three, she grew up in a house rich with experimental art and musical expression. Paul would often make cassettes of rare and eclectic music for his daughter to listen to and her early influences included Carla Bley, Robert Wyatt, and later PJ Harvey. By her teens, she followed in her parents' footsteps by attending the Etobicoke School of the Arts (ESA) to study drama. There she met Amy Millan and Kevin Drew, with whom she would later collaborate in Broken Social Scene (co-founded by Drew), a musical collective. During their time at ESA, Haines and Millan formed their first band together (around 1990), and she also briefly dated Drew.\n\nHaines attended the University of British Columbia in Vancouver between 1992 and 1993, and Concordia University in Montreal between 1995 and 1996. In 1996, she distributed a limited-edition album entitled \"Cut in Half and Also Double\" that included songs written and recorded during her student years.\n\nHaines's middle name is Savitri. She is named after , an epic poem by Sri Aurobindo.\n\nHaines met James Shaw in Toronto in 1997. Initially, the duo's name was \"Mainstream\". After releasing an EP entitled \"Mainstream EP\", they changed the band's name to \"Metric\", after a sound that was programmed by Shaw on his keyboard in 1997 or 1998. Joshua Winstead and Joules Scott-Key joined the band in 2001.\n\nAs of September 2018, Metric has released seven studio albums: \"Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?\" (2003), \"Live It Out\" (2005), \"Grow Up and Blow Away\" (2007, but recorded in 2001), \"Fantasies\" (2009), \"Synthetica\" (2012), \"Pagans in Vegas\" (2015), and \"Art of Doubt\" (2018).\n\nDuring her time in Metric, Haines also contributed vocals or backing vocals to songs by Broken Social Scene, Jason Collett, Stars, Delerium, K-Os, KC Accidental, The Stills, Tiësto, The Crystal Method and Todor Kobakov.\n\nIn 2004, Metric appeared in the 2004 drama film \"Clean\". Haines and the rest of the band, appearing as themselves, performed their song \"Dead Disco\" and completed minor speaking roles in a backstage scene. \"Dead Disco\" also featured on \"Clean Original Soundtrack\".\n\nIn 2006, Haines released the studio album \"Knives Don't Have Your Back\", under the moniker \"Emily Haines & The Soft Skeleton\". The songs \"Our Hell\" and \"Doctor Blind\" were issued as singles and corresponding music videos were produced. \"Knives Don't Have Your Back\" was followed in 2007 by the EP \"What Is Free to a Good Home?\"—recordings that were inspired by the death of her father.\nI found myself with a body of work that was dealing with a whole whack of themes that really weren't suited to Metric. It would've been very strange to bring those songs to a band. The way Metric songs usually develop is that I write something on the piano that sounds a lot like those songs.\n\nHer solo work is typically more subdued and piano-based than her work with Metric. She occasionally plays solo shows, with Amy Millan featured as the opening act.\n\nAccording to Haines, the album \"Synthetica\" is \"about forcing yourself to confront what you see in the mirror when you finally stand still long enough to catch a reflection. \"Synthetica\" is about being able to identify the original in a long line of reproductions. It's about what is real vs what is artificial.\" The album contains the song \"The Wanderlust\", Haines's collaboration with Lou Reed.\n\nIn an August 2013 interview, Haines reflected on the early years of her musical career in relation to the success of Metric in 2013:\nThere are a million things that I could have done that would have made it less difficult in the beginning, but the moments I'm most proud of are those first shows where we managed to get 15 people in a random bar to be committed to what's happening with the music. I know it's hard for people to imagine that would be the hardest shows we've ever played. I've played with Lou [Reed], I've played to tens of thousands of people, I've played for the Queen, but nothing is harder than those moments when you have the conviction to play in front of those 15 people and own it.\n\nHaines has explained that she is a \"big leaver\" when she encounters difficulty with the creative process, or is lacking inspiration. Prior to the fourth Metric album \"Fantasies\", Haines traveled to Argentina. Haines further explains: \"The advice that I would give anyone is just get over yourself and forget yourself. Realize what you don't know ... Don't be so precious about yourself.\"\n\nEmily Haines became good friends with Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson before Reed's death. When Lou Reed and Emily met, he asked if she would rather be The Beatles or The Rolling Stones and she shot back \"Velvet Underground.\"\n\nHaines performed with Broken Social Scene on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert 30 March 2017.\n\nHaines contributed to Broken Social Scene's album Hug of Thunder, released summer 2017. It is their first new album in seven years. In May 2017, Haines was with Broken Social Scene in Manchester, England, the night after the terror attack at the Ariana Grande concert. Haines attributes her ability to carry on and play after the attack to the support of former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr.\n\nHaines released the second studio album as \"Emily Haines & The Soft Skeleton\", titled \"Choir of the Mind\" on 15 September 2017. The album's lead single \"Fatal Gift\" was released on 9 June 2017. The album was released by Last Gang Records/eOne. This was her first solo release in over a decade. \"Choir of the Mind\" was recorded during September and October 2016 in Toronto. A tour supporting \"Choir of the Mind\" took place throughout North America in late 2017.\n\nWhen performing live with her band Metric, Haines sings and plays two synthesizers. Her primary synthesizer is a Sequential Circuits Pro-One, which she has played since the band's early years. As secondary synthesizer, she played a Kawai MP9000 in Metric's early years, which was replaced by E-mu PK-6 Proteus Keys from 2003 to 2011, and followed by Clavia Nord Wave since 2012.\n\nDuring some Metric live songs, Haines also plays a tambourine or an electric guitar. During Metric acoustic appearances, Haines sings and sometimes plays piano or harmonica, while her bandmate James Shaw plays the acoustic guitar.\n\nHaines sang and played a piano when she performed live with a backing band as Emily Haines & The Soft Skeleton.\n\nAs of late August 2013, Haines is involved with FLEET4HEARme, a collaboration between herself, Fleet Jewelry, and HearMe—the latter is an organization that aims to increase children's access to music programs in public schools. In support of the project, Haines explained: \"I feel like anybody who wants to play an instrument should be able to.\" September 2015, Rudsak unveiled a leather jacket customized by Emily Haines. The jacket is a classic black motor-cycle style with lyrics from \"The Governess\" on the back.\n\nMetric is active with Global Citizen, which aims to tackle the world's most challenging issues via social change, and Haines is also involved with its girls and women issues campaign #SheDecides.\n\nHaines partnered with \"House of Matriarch High Perfumery\" to create a fragrance called \"Siren\".\n\nAlbums\n\nAlbums\n\nEPs\n\nSingles\n\nMusic videos\n\nAlbums\n\nThe following songs are credited with Emily Haines on either lead or backing vocals:\n\n\n\n\n"}

At least 300 people, including the chief baron and sheriff, are thought to have died as a result of this event. It received its name because it was believed to have been associated with a trial at the Assize Court at Oxford Castle.\n\nReports vary as to the total number of deaths that occurred in the \"Black Assize\". The casualties in Oxford itself are consistently recorded as approximately 300, but some reports say that further deaths occurred outside the city. One report records:\n\nThis reported lack of deaths among women and children led to speculation about the causes of the casualties.\n\nOn the wall inside the Main Hall of the Old County Hall of Oxfordshire in New Road, an inscription reads:\n\nFrom the time of the Black Death in the mid-14th century until the second half of the 19th century, Oxford was regularly visited by plague, cholera, smallpox and typhoid fevers. In 1348, the Black Death reduced the city's population to such an extent that Gloucester College (from which Gloucester Green derives its name) was forced to close. In 1571, Oxford University had to postpone the start of term because of an outbreak of plague, and the 'gaol fever' six years later may have been part of the same epidemic, being considered more worthy of note because its victims included the Lord Chief Baron and the Lord High Sheriff.\n\nThis account of disease is reflected in a number of sources.\n\nAn early Chronicle records:\n\nA 19th-century account is more sure of the cause:\n\nOther accounts reject the notion of disease as a cause:\n\nFurther accounts merely attribute the deaths to a curse supposedly uttered by Rowland Jenkes.\n\nThe Black Assizes has featured as a display at Oxford Castle and is a regular feature of Oxford ghost tours, where the story of Rowland Jenkes' curse is given prominence.\n\nThe events of this time are part of the backdrop to the historical crime novel \"Heresy\" by S. J. Parris in which Rowland Jenkes appears as a character.\n\nBlack Assize of Exeter 1586\n"}

Deciding to make his career selling model railroad supplies, he became a full-time retailer in 1946. Athearn opened a separate facility in Hawthorne, California in 1948, and that same year he branched into HO scale models for the first time.\n\nAthearn acquired the Globe Models product line and improved upon it, introducing a comprehensive array of locomotive, passenger, and freight car models. Improvements included all-wheel drive and electrical contact. One innovation was the \"Hi-Fi\" drive mechanism, employing small rubber bands to transfer motion from the motor spindle to the axles. Another was the double-ended ring magnet motor, which permitted easy connection to all-wheel-drive assemblies. Athearn was also able to incorporate flywheels into double-ended drives.\n\nThe company produced a model of the Boston & Maine P4 class Pacific steam locomotive which incorporated a cast zinc alloy base and thermoplastic resin superstructure. It had a worm drive and all power pickup was through the bipolar trucks that carried the tender. This item was discontinued after the Wilson motor was no longer available, and was not redesigned for a more technologically advanced motor.\n\nStarting in the mid 1950s, Athearn produced shortened versions of streamlined and heavyweight passenger cars based on Southern Pacific and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe prototypes. The company also offered a variety of freight cars with sprung and equalized trucks. The cars could be obtained in simple kit form, or ready-to-run. A model of the Budd Rail Diesel Car was introduced in 1953 with a metal body, and reintroduced in 1958 in plastic. The comprehensive scope of the product line contributed to the popularity of HO as a model railroad scale, due to the ready availability of items and their low cost.\n\nWhen Lionel Corporation introduced their line of HO scale trains in 1958, many of the trains were produced by Athearn. Athearn also produced trains for the short-lived Cox Models brand of electric train sets in the 1970s. Many of these products were pre-existing items from the Athearn catalog repackaged with Cox branding. Freight cars packaged with train sets sold by Atlas Model Railroad Co. in the 1970s also came from Athearn.\n\nIrv Athearn died in 1991. New owners took control in 1994, but continued to follow Athearn's business model. Paul Lubliner's fine quality tooling for his \"Highliners\" brand of EMD F-units was acquired by Athearn in 1998 and integrated into their new Genesis line. In 2002, Athearn acquired Rail Power Products, as well as the tooling for modern 50' boxcars from Details West.\n\nAthearn was purchased in 2004 by Horizon Hobby, which moved the company from Compton to a new facility in Carson, California. At the same time, Horizon purchased Model Die Casting and their line of Roundhouse brand trains. A major international hobby distributor, Horizon Hobby is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois. In 2006, Horizon purchased McHenry Couplers.\n\nIn 2008, Athearn acquired the tooling for the short-lived \"Tower 55\" series of HO scale diesels from Overland Models. Much of this tooling made its way into the Athearn Genesis line.\nIn mid-2009, all remaining U.S. production was moved to China and warehousing moved to parent Horizon Hobby. Sales and product development was moved to a smaller facility in Long Beach, California.\n\nOn October 16, 2009, Athearn announced that it would stop making so-called \"blue-box kits\" citing increased manufacturing and labor costs.\n\nAthearn continues to produce ready-to-run models of diesel locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars representing a variety of eras and railroads. The company sells three lines: Genesis, the highest-cost, highest-quality, with DCC sound and fine details; and two lower-priced, less-detailed lines: Ready-to-Roll, representing trains from the steam-to-diesel transition period to today; and Roundhouse, representing trains from the days of steam era railroading.\n\nMcMurtry L.

The plot is a tribute to Al Jolson's film \"The Jazz Singer\".\n\nThe young owl is unjustly kicked out of his family's house by his disciplinarian violinist father, Professor Fritz Owl (Billy Bletcher), after he is caught singing jazz instead of \"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes\" to the reed (pump) organ accompaniment of his mother (voiced by Martha Wentworth). While wandering, he comes across a radio amateur contest (clearly a takeoff of the Major Bowes Amateur Hour), hosted by \"Jack Bunny\" (a pun on Jack Benny and later used in \"Goofy Groceries\", voiced by Tedd Pierce). Billing himself as \"Owl Jolson\" (a reference to Al Jolson) he wins the contest, but not before his father has finally seen his son's potential and allows him to freely sing jazz. His singing voice is by Johnnie Davis.\n\n\nAs with several early Warners cartoons, it is a sense a music video designed to push a song from the Warners library.\n\nThe song in question, \"I Love to Singa\", was first written by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg for the 1936 Warner Bros. feature-length film \"The Singing Kid\". It is performed three times in the film: first by Al Jolson and Cab Calloway, then by the Yacht Club Boys and Jolson, and finally again by Calloway and Jolson. During this period, it was customary for Warners to have their animation production partner, Leon Schlesinger Productions, make \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoons based upon songs from their features.\n\nThe cartoon has become a cult favorite, with a pervasive impact on popular culture. The short, one of the earliest \"Merrie Melodies\" produced in Technicolor's 3-strip process, is recognized as one of Avery's early masterpieces.\n\nThe May 7, 2013 episode of \"The Looney Tunes Show\", \"Gribbler's Quest\", featured a Merrie Melodies segment in which Gossamer plays the piano and sings \"I Love to Singa\" (with new audio sung by Kwesi Boakye). This was one of two instances of the show's Merrie Melodies segment using a classic song rather than a new composition with the other instance being Yellow Bird. However the lyrics were changed to remove racist terms such as mammy.\n\nIn the first episode of the American animated television series \"South Park\", \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\", Cartman is hit by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to \"I Love to Singa\". Afterwards, Stan Marsh asks \"What the hell was that?\" and Kyle Broflovski stating that Cartman \"Is under alien control!\".\n\nOwl Jolson appears in several levels of the video game tie-in to \"\", singing \"I Love to Singa\" via archive audio. Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck will comment upon Owl when they get close enough.\n\n\n"}

He is, to date, the only NFL player to die on the field during a game.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Hughes moved with his family to Texas when he was young, along with his 12 siblings. Hughes attended high school in Abilene at Abilene High School.\n\nHughes played college football at Texas Western College, now the University of Texas at El Paso, where he is still listed in the all-time football records; his accomplishments include:\n\nHe was inducted into the UTEP Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nHughes was selected in the fourth round by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1967 NFL/AFL draft and played three seasons with the Eagles before he was traded to the Detroit Lions prior to the start of the 1970 season. Although listed as a wide receiver he saw most action on special teams, being a backup at wide receiver. In his five-year career he caught only 15 passes.\n\nOn Oct. 24, 1971, the Lions hosted the Chicago Bears at Tiger Stadium. Late in the 4th Quarter, with Detroit trailing 28–23, the Lions were driving into Chicago territory and Hughes, who entered the game as an injury replacement, caught a pass from quarterback Greg Landry for 32 yards and a first down at the Bears' 37-yard line.\n\nThree plays later, Landry threw a pass that tight end Charlie Sanders dropped near the end zone. Hughes, a decoy on the play, began running back to the huddle with 1:02 showing on the clock. Suddenly, he dropped to the turf clutching his chest around the 20-yard line. Hughes collapsed near Bears linebacker Dick Butkus, who saw him begin to convulse violently on the field. Butkus motioned to the sideline frantically to get Hughes assistance.\n\nBoth teams' doctors and trainers, along with a physician who happened to be attending the game, ran to Hughes to try to save him. An ambulance was called for and arrived to take Hughes to Henry Ford Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:34 pm that afternoon. He was 28 years old. The game was played to its conclusion in front of a now-stunned silent crowd in Tiger Stadium, with the Bears' lead holding. The Lions awaited word of Hughes' condition after the game and the players were informed once word had broken that he was dead.\n\nA postmortem examination revealed that Hughes was suffering from undiagnosed and advanced arteriosclerosis (one of his coronary arteries was 75% blocked) and that he had a family history of heart disease. The direct cause of death was a coronary thrombosis, which caused a massive myocardial infarction that cut off the blood flow to his heart. Hughes was buried in San Antonio, Texas, and all 40 of his Lions teammates attended his funeral, including head coach Joe Schmidt. He was survived by his widow, Sharon Leah, and his son, who was 1 year and 11 months old at the time, Brandon Shane. A $10,000 trust fund was set up for his son Brandon by an insurance company. His widow filed a $21.5 million malpractice lawsuit against Henry Ford Hospital in 1972 for not diagnosing his condition when he was hospitalized after complaining of chest pains. The lawsuit was settled on October 3, 1974 for an undisclosed amount of money.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2076391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076391", "title": "Jason Webley", "text": "Jason Webley\n\nJason Webley is an American musician known for his sincere fusion of folk, experimental, and alternative music. Webley plays the guitar and accordion, sometimes providing percussion by stomping or shaking a plastic vodka bottle filled with coins. Webley began his career performing solo, but has collaborated with a wide range of artists. He has also organized several commemorative concerts and events memorializing everything from tragedies in his hometown of Everett, Washington to tomatoes.\n\nWebley is originally from Everett, Washington. In high school, Webley played in a punk band called Moral Minority. He picked up the accordion in 1996 in his last year in college at the University of Washington when he was part of a performance of Bertolt Brecht's play \"The Caucasian Chalk Circle\", and wrote a couple of songs for the play on the accordion. He later recalled, \"I was just a geeky kid; accordion came later. It's since playing accordion that I've become cool. I used to be a geek with an electric guitar. I had a guitar and played in punky bands and I had a computer. I sequenced stuff. I was much geekier.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1998 Webley quit his day job and began busking. Later that year he recorded the album Viaje in his kitchen and independently released it. In 1999, Webley releasedAgainst the Night, which would become one of his most popular albums. \"Against the Night\" includes \"Last Song\" and \"Dance While the Sky Crashes Down,\" which would be staples of his live performances for the next two decades.\n\nWebley's first four albums were released or re-released by Springman Records, but he now owns his own record label, Eleven Records, and sells his merchandise via website or at concerts. \n\nWebley plays various instruments on his albums, including guitar, accordion, piano, marimba, and glockenspiel; when he tours, however, he usually only brings his guitar, an accordion, and a vodka bottle filled with coins from around the world. He has been known to do short tours with a backing band. Webley has performed at several festivals, including Burning Man, Glastonbury Festival, VanFest, and the Oregon Country Fair. His sound has been compared to Tom Waits, Vladimir Vysotsky, Leonard Cohen, and Bob Dylan.\n\nWebley's music and live performances reflect his eclectic personality. Webley has a fascination with the number 11. References to the number can be found throughout his discography. He also performed a special commemorative concert on November 11th, 2011. \n\nWebley was also once known for incorporating vegetables into his performances. He once owned a late 1990s model Toyota Corolla that had been converted into a giant tomato. It was painted red, and had a green fiberglass stem attached to the roof of the car (until the stem was stolen). He reported at a concert that his beloved Toyota had \"passed away\" around January 18, 2011. Webley's vegetable fixation is no longer a main element of his live performances. \n\nFrom 2000 to 2004 Webley pretended to die every Halloween only to be born in the spring.\n\nIn May 2014 Jason Webley performed the songs 'Promise To The Moon' as well as 'These and More Than These' by Joseph Fink; while doing a series of live shows with the show Welcome to Night Vale, as well as writing an original song as the character Louie Blasco on the podcast.\n\nIn 2011, Webley scaled back his touring schedule and started focusing more on other projects. He still performs annually at some venues such as the Oregon Country Fair. \n\nWebley organized the Monsters of Accordion tour, an all-accordion extravaganza that took place on the West Coast. The tour came together when Webley was invited to play at an accordion shop in Oakland, and met two Bay Area accordionists, Daniel Ari and Aaron Seeman. They decided to do an accordion-only tour, which was the first Monsters of Accordion. The tour has since featured such accordionists as Corn Mo, Geoff Berner, Amy Denio, Mark Growden, (former Gogol Bordello member) Stevhen Iancu, and Eric Stern (frontman of Vagabond Opera).\n\nIn 2014 Webley released, Margaret, a collaborative album commemorating Margaret Rucker, the daughter of a prominent Everett family. The album was sparked by Webley's fascination with Rucker's pyramidal tomb and his friends discovery of one of Rucker's scrapbooks in a California dumpster. The album was released along with a book and six live shows were performed up and down the West Coast. The project was funded via a Kickstarter Campaign.\n\nIn 2016 Webley once again turned to crowdfunding to co-create an album centered on Everett's history. This time the focus was the Everett Massacre. The album commemorated the centennial of the massacre. It was performed live at the historic Everett Theater one day before the centennial (hence the title, \"One Hundred Years Ago Tomorrow\").\nIn 2017, Webley began organizing a floating circus on the Willamette River. After his father became ill the project was delayed for two years. In the summer of 2019, the \"Flotsam River Circus\" finally set sail from Corvallis, Oregon after performing at the Oregon Country Fair. Shows were performed at waterfront parks with a homemade barge serving as the stage.\n\nWebley has announced that there will be a series of 11 collaborative projects between him and his songwriter friends, and each recording will be limited to 1,111 numbered copies. He has thus far collaborated with Jay Thompson, Andru Bemis, Reverend Peyton, and Sxip Shirey.\n\nIn September 2007, Webley collaborated with Amanda Palmer to release Evelyn Evelyn's debut EP \"Elephant Elephant\" via Webley's Eleven Records.\n\nAfter a December 2007 concert at Hampshire College, Webley and Hampshire student Professor Science collaborated on a song about mittens known as \"The Mitten Opera\". Webley repeated this tradition the following two nights, first after a concert at Bard College, where he and a group of students collaborated on a song called \"Clown Car to Mulberry\", then at Sarah Lawrence College, where Webley and almost the entire audience performed the hardcore punk-inspired \"Bad Milk\". All three songs are available on YouTube.\n\nAt a concert at The Saint in Asbury Park, New Jersey in January 2009, Webley was joined on stage by Calamity Menagerie to perform \"Ways To Love\" and \"Quite Contrary\" – a song he rarely plays at live shows.\n\nIn December 2011, Webley announced the intention to make his back catalogue available as paid downloads online on the website BandCamp.\n\nIn February 2018, Webley announced the release of the new Amanda Palmer music video \"Judy Blume\" which he directed.\n\n\n\n"}

Chlopicki entered the army in 1785 and fought under Kościuszko in the Uprising of 1794. Warsaw was surrendered to the Russians on November 8, 1794, after which Chlopicki went to France and joined the Army of the Cisalpine Republic under General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. In France he is known as Grégoire Joseph Clopicki de Necznia.\n\nHe was present at all the engagements fought during 1792-1794, especially distinguishing himself at the Battle of Racławice, when he was General Franciszek Rymkiewicz's adjutant.

However, he saw the hopelessness of the insurrection and quickly resigned on 23 January; then, however, he joined the army as a private soldier and fought in some battles. At Wawer (February 19) and at the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska (February 20) he displayed all his old bravery, but was so seriously wounded at the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska that he had to be conveyed to Kraków, near which city he lived in complete retirement until his death in 1854.\n"}

The film includes elements of tongue-in-cheek horror, comedy, romance and drama, and does not fit neatly into any one genre.\n\nMay Ho (Sammi Cheng) is a woman who inherits a vast fortune when her rich husband drowns in a scuba diving accident in the Caribbean. May told several joking lies to win her Stanford-educated, extremely successful husband, and his mother and sister are less than pleased when they find out, especially since they still harbor suspicions about her motives in marrying her husband after knowing him for only seven days. Nonetheless, the house, fortune, and a portion of the family fashion company are hers. Depressed, alone, and deeply missing her husband (feelings further exacerbated when her husband's dog, Whisky, dies), May goes on a binge of eating, drinking, smoking, watching television, and stealing from her own company's stores, culminating in a drunken car ride and near-fatal car accident.\n\nMay finds herself lying on the ground outside her car and thinks she is unscathed, until she approaches her vehicle and sees her bloody body in the driver's seat. Ken Wong (Lau Ching Wan) appears to her and scares her into returning to her body, reviving herself.\n\nAlthough she just barely evaded death, the left side of May's face is heavily injured. Later in the hospital, when she removes the gauze covering her left eye, she suddenly realizes she can see ghosts with that eye. She soon finds herself in the constant company and care of the ghost Ken, who claims that he is her former classmate who died when he was 13 in a typhoon out at sea. Throughout their escapades in the realm of the supernatural, May slowly develops a connection with him. However, despite all the ghosts she has encountered, her husband has never appeared to her and she deeply wants to see him, even for just an instant. Ken attempts to help her fulfill this wish before he crosses the Twilight Junction to be reincarnated though it initially appears she did not succeed. Only the spirit of her husband's late dog, Whisky, appears - seemingly close to Ken as if the canine knows him. Ken ask May for a final wish to hug her before he moves on, and in doing so she had to pretend that he was her husband.\n\nLater, she goes to check on the restoration of her husband's vintage car and discovers the restorer resembles Ken, who turned to be the real Ken who did not really die when he was 13. She finally realize that the ghost who had been at her side all the while was actually her dead husband in disguise to prevent her from becoming too attached to him and to urge her to move on. She tries several ways to contact him after he had moved on, but all attempts were useless. Her ability to see ghosts had also disappeared. The film ends with a hint of a future romance between May and Ken.\n\n\nParamount Pictures acquired the remake rights and decided to release in 2013.\n\n"}

{"id": "2076436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076436", "title": "Continental collision", "text": "Continental collision\n\nContinental collision is a phenomenon of the plate tectonics of Earth that occurs at convergent boundaries. Continental collision is a variation on the fundamental process of subduction, whereby the subduction zone is destroyed, mountains produced, and two continents sutured together. Continental collision is only known to occur on Earth.\n\nContinental collision is not an instantaneous event, but may take several tens of millions of years before the faulting and folding caused by collisions stops. The collision between India and Asia has been going on for about 50 million years already and shows no signs of abating. Collision between East and West Gondwana to form the East African Orogen took about 100 million years from beginning (610 Ma) to end (510 Ma). Collision between Gondwana and Laurasia to form Pangea occurred in a relatively brief interval, about 50 million years long.\n\nThe process begins as two continents (different bits of continental crust), separated across a tract of ocean (and oceanic crust), approach each other, while the oceanic crust is slowly consumed at a subduction zone. The subduction zone runs along the edge of one of the continents and dips under it, raising volcanic mountain chains at some distance behind it, such as the Andes of South America today. Subduction involves the whole lithosphere, the density of which is largely controlled by the nature of the crust it carries. Oceanic crust is thin (~6 km thick) and dense (about 3.3 g/cm³), consisting of basalt, gabbro, and peridotite. Consequently, most oceanic crust is subducted easily at an oceanic trench. In contrast, continental crust is thick (~45 km thick) and buoyant, composed mostly of granitic rocks (average density about 2.5 g/cm³). Continental crust is subducted with difficulty, but is subducted to depths of 90-150 km or more, as evidenced by ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic suites. Normal subduction continues as long as the ocean exists, but the subduction system is disrupted as the continent carried by the downgoing plate enters the trench. Because it contains thick continental crust, this lithosphere is less dense than the underlying asthenospheric mantle and normal subduction is disrupted. The volcanic arc on the upper plate is slowly extinguished. Resisting subduction, the crust buckles up and under, raising mountains where a trench used to be. The position of the trench becomes a zone that marks the suture between the two continental terranes. Suture zones are often marked by fragments of the pre-existing oceanic crust and mantle rocks, known as ophiolites.\n\nThe continental crust on the downgoing plate is deeply subducted as part of the downgoing plate during collision, defined as buoyant crust entering a subduction zone. An unknown proportion of subducted continental crust returns to the surface as ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic terranes, which contain metamorphic coesite and/or diamond plus or minus unusual silicon-rich garnets and/or potassium-bearing pyroxenes. The presence of these minerals demonstrate subduction of continental crust to at least 90–140 km deep. Examples of UHP terranes are known from the Dabie–Sulu belt of east-central China, the Western Alps, the Himalaya of India, the Kokchetav Massif of Kazakhstan, the Bohemian Massif of Europe, the North Qaidam of Northwestern China, the Western Gneiss Region of Norway, and Mali. Most UHP terranes consist of an imbricated sheets or nappes. The fact that most UHP terranes consist of thin sheets suggests that much thicker, volumetrically dominant tracts of continental crust are more deeply subducted.\n\nAn orogeny is underway when mountains begin to grow in the collision zone. There are other modes of mountain formation and orogeny but certainly continental collision is one of the most important. Rainfall and snowfall increase on the mountains as these rise, perhaps at a rate of a few millimeters per year (at a growth rate of 1 mm/year, a 5,000 m tall mountain can form in 5 million years, a time period that is less than 10% of the life of a typical collision zone). River systems form, and glaciers may grow on the highest peaks. Erosion accelerates as the mountains rise, and great volumes of sediment are shed into the rivers, which carry sediment away from the mountains to be deposited in sedimentary basins in the surrounding lowlands. Crustal rocks are thrust faulted over the sediments and the mountain belt broadens as it rises in height. A crustal root also develops, as required by isostasy; mountains can be high if underlain by thicker crust. Crustal thickening may happen as a result of crustal shortening or when one crust overthrusts the other. Thickening is accompanied by heating, so the crust becomes weaker as it thickens. The lower crust begins to flow and collapse under the growing mountain mass, forming rifts near the crest of the mountain range. The lower crust may partially melt, forming anatectic granites which then rise into the overlying units, forming granite intrusions. Crustal thickening provides one of two negative feedbacks on mountain growth in collision zones, the other being erosion. The popular notion that erosion is responsible for destroying mountains is only half correct - viscous flow of weak lower mantle also reduces relief with time, especially once the collision is complete and the two continents are completely sutured. Convergence between the continents continues because the crust is still being pulled down by oceanic lithosphere sinking in the subduction zone to either side of the collision as well as beneath the impinging continent. \n\nThe pace of mountain building associated with the collision is measured by radiometric dating of igneous rocks or units that have been metamorphosed during the collision and by examining the record of sediments shed from the rising mountains into the surrounding basins. The pace of ancient convergence can be determined with paleomagnetic measurements, while the present rate of convergence can be measured with GPS.\n\nThe effects of the collision are felt far beyond the immediate site of collision and mountain-building. As convergence between the two continents continues, the region of crustal thickening and elevation will become broader. If there is an oceanic free face, the adjacent crustal blocks may move towards it. As an example of this, the collision of India with Asia forced large regions of crust to move south to form modern Southeast Asia. Another example is the collision of Arabia with Asia, which is squeezing the Anatolian Plate (present day Turkey). As a result, Turkey is moving west and south into the Mediterranean Sea and away from the collision zone. These far-field effects may result in the formation of rifts, and rift valleys such as that occupied by Lake Baikal, the deepest lake on Earth.\n\nContinental collisions are a critical part of the supercontinent cycle and have happened many times in the past. Ancient collision zones are deeply eroded but may still be recognized because these mark sites of intense deformation, metamorphism, and plutonic activity that separate tracts of continental crust having different geologic histories prior to the collision. Old collision zones are commonly called \"suture zones\" by geologists, because this is where two previous continents are joined or \"sutured\" together.\n\n\n"}

He became the Bishop of St David's in 1897.\n\nBorn at Ysgubor Wen, Caernarfonshire (Gwynedd), his father Griffith Owen was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist. Though he never deviated from his own loyalties, he watched his son’s career as an Anglican with great pride. Owen’s mother, Ann Jones from Aberdaron, could not easily reconcile herself to her son becoming an Anglican, however, nor could she wholly accept the fact that he married an English wife.\n\nIn 1872, Owen was awarded a mathematical scholarship at Jesus College, Oxford, where he read classics and mathematics. As a graduate, he began a teaching career at Botwnnog grammar school. Whilst at Botwnnog, Owen discovered an interest in the Anglicanism and was gradually drawn towards ordination, though he decided to teach for a few years until he was sure of his vocation.\n\nAs a respected educator, Owen was appointed Professor of Welsh at St David’s College, Lampeter (now the University of Wales Trinity Saint David) in 1879 and committed himself in two respects: he would advance the study of the Welsh language at the college and would aim to be ordained before, or soon after, joining the college. In both respects he was successful and was ordained deacon in 1879 and priest in 1880.\n\nIn 1889, A. G. Edwards, newly appointed Bishop of St Asaph, invited Owen to join him as dean. At St Asaph, Owen maintained an interest in education and his colleagues nominated him to serve on the charter committee of the nascent University of Wales, established in 1891, which gave him a new emphasis to his existing interest in higher education.\n\nIn 1892, Owen returned to Lampeter as principal, an office he was to hold until he became Bishop of Saint David's in 1897. His time as principal was not an easy one: he fought a sustained battle for Lampeter to be included in the newly formed federal University of Wales, which had already embraced the colleges at Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff universities. Lampeter already conferred its own degrees under Royal Charter and, for Owen, it was unthinkable that it should be excluded from this new university. Those against Lampeter's admission, however, argued that the original plan for Lampeter had been to found a theological college and, as such, it should be excluded like any other denominational college in the nation. Owen was furious, regarding Lampeter as a university institution \"and\" theological college. He petitioned the privy council, sparking a debate in the House of Lords. Lampeter’s case was upheld, but the Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, refused to be moved and the University of Wales received its royal charter with Lampeter firmly excluded. Too late to effect this outcome, Owen established a supplemental charter for the college, re-affirming in the plainest terms that the college existed to \"\"receive and educate any person whatsoever, whether destined for Holy Orders or not\"\". Lampeter was not to be admitted to the university until 1971.\n\nIn January 1897, William Basil Jones, Bishop of St David’s, died and, within six weeks, Owen had been named as his successor. Much of Owen’s episcopate was marked by controversy and he was not afraid of confrontation, even so he led the Church in Wales through the difficult disestablishment and become regarded as spokesman for the Welsh church during this time. In private correspondence there was even a suggestion that he should become Wales’ first archbishop, but he refused to consider it. In Easter week 1920, he presided over the election of Bishop Edwards as the first Archbishop of Wales.\n\nOwen died of a short illness on 4 November 1926 and was buried on 9 November at Abergwili, Carmarthenshire.\n\nOwen is extremely well documented not least in the press, both denominational and national (in both senses) due to his combative nature and the controversial positions he took. The two volume Life by his daughter, Eluned Owen, is inevitably partial but most readily available.\n\nEluned E. Owen, The Early Life of Bishop Owen, A Son of Lleyn, Gomerian Press, 1958\n\nEluned E.

Examples include glue, adhesive and thickening.\nExamples of mechanical binders are bond stones in masonry and tie beams in timber framing.\nBinders are loosely classified as organic (bitums, animal and plant glues, polymers) and inorganic (lime, cement, gypsum, liquid glass, etc.). These can be either metallic or ceramic as well as polymeric depending on the nature of the main material. For example, in the compound WC-Co (Tungsten Carbide used in cutting tools) Co constitutes the binding agent for the WC particles.\n\nBased on their chemical resistance, binders are classified by the field of use: non-hydraulic (gypsum, air-cements, magnesia, hydrated lime), hydraulic (Roman cement, portland cement, hydraulic lime), acid-resistant (silicon fluoride cement, quartz cement), and autoclavable (harden at 170 to 300°С i.e. 8-16 atm pressure and, e.g., comprise CaSiO3 materials).\n\nSome materials labeled as binders such as cement have a high compressive strength but low tensile strength and need to be reinforced with fibrous material or rebar if tension and shear forces will be applied.\n\nOther binding agents such as resins may be tough and possibly elastic but can neither bear compressive nor tensile force. Tensile strength is greatly improved in composite materials consisting of resin as the matrix and fiber as a reinforcement. Compressive strength can be improved by adding filling material.\n\nIn art, binders have use in painting, where they hold together pigments and sometimes filling material to form paints, pastels, and other materials. Binders used include wax, linseed oil, gum arabic, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, gums, or protein such as egg white or casein. Glue is traditionally made by the boiling of hoofs, bones, or skin of animals and then mixing the hard gelatinous residue with water. Natural gum-based binders are made from substances extracted from plants. Larger amounts of dry substance are added to liquid binders in order to cast or model sculptures and reliefs.\n\nIn cooking, various edible thickening agents are used as binders. Some of them, e.g. tapioca flour, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and various starches are also used in pharmacology in making tablets. Tablet binders include lactose powder, sucrose powder, tapioca starch (cassava flour) and microcrystalline cellulose.\n\nIn building construction, concrete uses cement as a binder. Asphalt pavement uses bitumen binder. Traditionally straw and natural fibres are used to strengthen clay in wattle-and-daub construction and in the building material cob which would otherwise become brittle after drying. Sand is added to improve compressive strength, hardness and reduce shrinkage. The binding property of clay is also used widely to prepare shaped articles (e.g. pots and vases) or to bind solid pieces (e.g. bricks).\n\nIn composite materials, epoxy, polyester or phenolic resins are common. In reinforced carbon–carbon, plastic or pitch resin is used as a source of carbon released through pyrolysis. Transite, hypertufa, papercrete and petecrete used cement as a binder.\n\nIn explosives, wax or polymers like polyisobutylene or styrene-butadiene rubber are often used as binders for plastic explosives. For polymer-bonded explosives, various synthetic polymers are used.\n\nIn rocket fuels, polybutadiene acrylonitrile copolymer was used in 1960-70's big solid-fuel booster rocket fuels.\n\nOrganic binders, designed to disintegrate by heat during baking, are used in sintering.\n\nIn the Classical World painters used materials like egg, wax, honey, lime, casein, linseed oil or bitumen as binders to mix with pigment in order to hold the pigment particles together in the formation of paint. Egg-based tempera was especially popular in Europe from the Middle Ages until the early 16th century. However, since that time, the binder of choice for paint has been oil.\n\n"}

Col. was the head of the domestic affairs section of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. In August 1945, he helped plan a \"coup\", the Kyūjō incident, along with Major Kenji Hatanaka and a handful of others. \nThe intent of the attempted \"coup\" was to prevent the Emperor's announcement of Japan's surrender from being broadcast. \n\nAs one of the most senior officers involved in the \"coup\", he was, at times, the leader of the group. He believed, as did his co-conspirators and many others, that the Emperor had to be separated from his peace-seeking advisors and convinced to change his mind. They believed that the costs of repelling an Allied land invasion would not be devastating, and that, ultimately, Japan would be better off under military rule, with his brother-in-law, Minister of War Korechika Anami as \"shōgun\".\n\nTakeshita had a close relationship with Anami, and was among the few who had the Minister's ear; Anami considered Takeshita one of his closest confidants, and so it was through him that the rebels gained much of their information and influence. Ultimately, however, Anami insisted that while he was sympathetic with the rebels' cause, he could not actively oppose the wishes of the Emperor. Despite being so trusted by the Minister, he was at times confused as to Anami's true desires regarding the \"coup\".\n\nIn the afternoon on August 14, Anami officially announced to the conspirators that the Cabinet had decided to terminate the war. The Cabinet operated by unanimous decision, and so this meant that Anami had given in. Faced with the now fully official opposition of the Cabinet, and the final loss of any aid Anami might have provided, Takeshita withdrew from the plot along with Col. Okikatsu Arao.\n\nEarly on the morning of August 15, 1945, Major Hatanaka spoke with Takeshita, trying one last time to convince him to rejoin the rebellion, and to secure the aid of General Anami. Takeshita refused, and realized, given the circumstances, that Anami would probably try to commit suicide. He traveled to the General's house, and acted as \"kaishakunin\", second, in his brother-in-law's act of \"seppuku\".\n\nUnlike several of his co-conspirators, Takeshita survived through the events of August 15, and, as of 1968, was the head of the Command and General Staff college, a general in the Land Self-Defense Forces.\n\n"}

An analyst at CTU Los Angeles (and later New York), she is Jack Bauer's most trusted colleague, often doing unconventional and unauthorized favors for him, even at personal risk to herself. As O'Brian, Rajskub appeared in 137 episodes of \"24\", more than any other actor except series star Kiefer Sutherland, who appeared in all 204 episodes of the series. UGO.com named her one of the best TV nerds. AOL named her one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.\n\nO'Brian is exceptionally intelligent; in particular she displays extraordinary mastery of computer science. Spending most of her time behind a computer terminal, she is rarely sent on field assignments; however, she has demonstrated proficiency with weapons in Day 4, 5, and 8. She works very well under pressure, yet it is obvious when she is under pressure, that she has always demonstrated a degree of social awkwardness. Despite her lack of social graces, Chloe has gained several friends at CTU and has shown to have a great deal of loyalty to them. She helped CTU Agent Chase Edmunds take care of his daughter from a previous relationship after the child's mother abandoned Chase and their child. She even tried to pass the child off as her own, so as to keep Chase's then-girlfriend, Kim Bauer, from knowing.\n\nBefore the start of Day 6, she and Milo Pressman briefly dated. This was a source of hostility between Milo and Morris.\n\nToward the end of Day 6, it is revealed that Chloe is pregnant with Morris's child.\n\nIn interviews to promote the show's return to Fox with the miniseries, \"\", actor Kiefer Sutherland revealed that Rajskub would be reprising Chloe, but hinted that the relationship between her and Jack Bauer would be more adversarial than before. He also suggested that the reason for this was possibly related to her actions during the show's final season.\n\nIntroduced in the third season of the series, Chloe O'Brian is a senior analyst at CTU. Her other experience at CTU includes Intelligence Agent and Internet Protocol Manager. She received her education at the University of California-Davis, having received her BSc in Computer Science. In \"\", it is revealed that before coming to CTU Los Angeles, she worked at CTU: Washington DC with Chase Edmunds.\n\nChloe continues to work at CTU as an analyst. She continues to help Jack (at the time, not a member of CTU) to follow the terrorists while risking her career. She is detained and fired when Director of CTU Los Angeles Erin Driscoll (the person who fired Jack) discovered Chloe is helping Jack behind her back.\n\nWhen Driscoll resigns and Michelle Dessler steps in, she is reinstated since none of the other CTU employees were as skilled as Chloe was. When the crisis ends later in the day, she, along with Michelle Dessler, Tony Almeida and former President David Palmer, help Jack to fake his death.\n\nChloe continues to grow as a person with the introduction of a love interest, a subordinate named Spenser Wolff. She finds out later that Spenser is a mole (albeit unknowingly), and turns him in immediately. He later states he is not a mole but at CTU as an Internal Affairs investigator.\n\nChloe is the only person who had continual contact with Jack since he faked his death. Chloe is also the only one involved in the plot to fake his death to survive from murder attempts committed by unknown parties (later discovered to be President Charles Logan and Jack's brother, Graem Bauer), narrowly escaping a car bomb and a subsequent attack by the terrorists who planted the bomb.\n\nShe is briefly arrested for aiding Jack, though her skills with computers allow her to avoid the consequences of her actions and returns to work at CTU. Sadly, Edgar Stiles does not survive the events of Day 5 and Chloe watches him die through the glass door. Chloe is visibly shaken by the death of one of her few best friends and regrets having been short with him earlier that day.\n\nChloe is later forced to work directly against her superiors in Homeland Security in order to help Audrey and Jack. She hacks into a CTU server and interferes with a satellite tracking Audrey's car. She is able to slip into the bathroom just before being caught red handed, but Homeland Security bureaucrat Miles Papazian is very suspicious that she is deliberately interfering with their orders to attempt to apprehend Jack, at that time subject to a warrant by President Logan.\n\nHomeland Security tricks Chloe into calling a pay phone where Audrey is currently located. They track the call to Van Nuys Airport and alert President Logan that they have located Bauer. Chloe is then put into custody by Miles. However, Chloe steals his keycard and escapes from detention. She grabs her laptop and leaves CTU. When leaving she encounters Shari Rothenburg but Chloe blackmails her to stay quiet. Chloe works with Buchanan from his home but Papazian is able to track her. Karen Hayes contacts Bill to alert them that Papazian has sent a team to arrest Chloe and that she has mere minutes to leave the house.\n\nChloe is able to escape and continues to aid Jack from a nearby hotel. Combined with Hayes, she works to help Jack locate the passenger on a private plane in possession of the audio tape implicating Logan in Palmer's death. Eventually she confirms that it is the co-pilot who has the tape. Hayes and Buchanan bring Chloe back to CTU shortly thereafter to help Jack make an emergency landing, because Logan has ordered an F18 to shoot down the plane. Bill Buchanan is able to locate a 4000 ft. strip on a Los Angeles Highway to use for a landing. Jack eventually lands safely and escapes from Logan's marine force with the help of Curtis Manning. Once Jack gets the audio tape back to CTU, Chloe sets to work preparing the audio tape for the United States Attorney General. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to Chloe, Miles destroys the digital recording while she is distracted.\n\nIn the final hours of Day 5, Chloe aids Jack in preventing Bierko from firing missiles from a Russian submarine. After the mission ends successfully, Jack tells her that he is going to attempt to get a confession from Logan and will need her help. With help from Mike Novick, Chloe is able to get Jack the necessary papers to board the presidential helicopter as a co-pilot. After Jack places a listening device on Logan that records his confession to Martha, Chloe transmits the recording to the Attorney General.\n\nWhen the crisis ends, Bill brings her something from Edgar's locker, a picture of Chloe and Edgar together. An emotionally spent Chloe leaves CTU for the day with her ex-husband Morris O'Brian, whom she had enlisted to help her at CTU.\n\nAfter the failed assassination of Assad via military helicopter, Chloe found an image of Jack rescuing the terrorist. She shared the information with Bill Buchanan, who conceded that from Jack's perspective, a rescue was the right action. Chloe suggests if Jack is right, then Fayed should be monitored. Buchanan agrees, and subsequently CTU obtains information that Fayed was indeed behind the latest waves of bombings.\n\nChloe is later able to recover data from the hard drive of one of Fayed's men that he was particularly interested in a specific set of terrorists Fayed demanded be set free. Later, after Jack notices Curtis Manning's demeanor around Assad, asks her to find out if there is a past connection between the two men. She later confirms that Manning's military unit took heavy losses at Assad's hands and that Assad beheaded two members of Manning's unit on television. Jack uses that information to prevent Manning from killing Assad, though the price is Manning's life.\n\nWhen chatter is intercepted between Fayed and Darren McCarthy, a profile of the man able to arm the four remaining suitcase nukes is sent, though the message is badly degraded. Morris works on reconstructing the image, while Milo finds information that states Morris's brother has been exposed to the radiation from the Valencia bomb and is in a hospital. Chloe informs him, but while Morris wants to go to his brother's side at once, Chloe insists he retrieve the data. After Morris downloads an illegal program that will speed up the reconstruction of the data, he leaves, and Chloe kisses him goodbye. Chloe then monitors the retrieval to find that the engineer was, in fact, Morris. Bill has her call Morris via cell phone with Jack on the line, and Chloe jumps nervously after hearing gunfire erupt as McCarthy corners and kidnaps Morris from his car and put into his with the help of McCarthy's girlfriend, Rita.\n\nChloe works to help locate Morris, who was tortured by Fayed into programming a device which would allow the detonation of the suitcase nukes. Chloe gives Jack the needed information in how to disable the suitcase nuke Fayed left behind after CTU assaulted his safe house. Afterwards, Jack and Chloe have a reunion at CTU where she thanks him for saving Morris's life, and she tells him she's glad Fayed didn't kill him. Jack thanks her for everything. She later visits Morris in the infirmary, but her attempts at compassion are dismissed by Morris's claims that he's responsible for Fayed ability to arm the remaining suitcase nukes. He tells her to go away. She later goes back to say they have a lead, and asks him to return to duty. He dismisses it as a ruse to get him to go back to work, and admits he's a coward. Chloe retorts he's pissing her off, and Morris says she can add it to his list of failings. Chloe slaps him, and he tells her if she wants to save somebody, save somebody who is worth saving. She tries to slap him again, but he blocks it. She tells Morris to stop feeling sorry for himself and get back to work.\n\nLater, she finds Morris is not at his work station. She investigates his palmtop, and calls his sponsor, who says she hasn't been in touch with Morris for years. Chloe confronts Morris in the men's room. He tells her he has a different sponsor now – who he \"did\" speak to on the phone – and berates Chloe for being 'obsessive' about his contacts. However, when Chloe leaves, he drains what is left of a bottle of whiskey down the sink.\n\nWhen Milo suspects that Morris has been drinking again, he asks Chloe to check Morris for any signs of alcohol. She reluctantly agrees, and walks over to him and kissed him, when he asked \"What was that for?\" she responded by saying \"Just checking your breath.\"\n\nLater, she helps Jack to steal the bomb's schematics. However, Morris discovers her act and forces her to tell Bill. When Bill orders everyone to help Jack Bauer under presidential order, he excludes her saying that \"I don't trust you\" but he changes his mind in the next episode when he tells her he needs his best people working on this.\n\nChloe is apparently upset and angry at Morris for forcing her to tell Bill the truth and the pair argue until Chloe's anger gets the better of her and she throws the fact that he armed nuclear weapons for terrorists, back in his face. Chloe insists that she didn't mean it but Morris puts in for a transfer out of Com and to no longer work aside Chloe. She is visibly upset and scolds herself for pushing the issue too far. Later, she attempts to apologize, but Morris tells her that their relationship is over. As Morris goes back to work, Chloe bursts into tears. Minutes later, Nadia notices that Chloe is not at her station and Morris claims not to know where she is.\n\nLater, Chloe confronts Morris over his decision to break up. Morris tells Chloe that he ended their relationship because he felt that neither of them would be able to move past the fact that he had armed the nuclear weapons. Soon afterwards, CTU came under attack and the entire staff, including Chloe, was taken hostage. Eventually Nadia, Jack, and Morris attacked the men holding them hostage and Chloe commended Nadia on her bravery.\n\nWhile at work, Chloe faints and is taken to the CTU medical department. It was revealed near the end of the final episode that she is pregnant. Morris, presumably the father, appears pleased at the news, and the two resume their relationship once again (in typical Morris fashion, he dismisses their breakup with a \"Sod that!\" comment).\n\nChloe does not appear in \"\", the two-hour TV prequel, which aired on Sunday, November 23, 2008, she and Bill Buchanan first appear in the third episode of the season.\n\nActress Mary Lynn Rajskub revealed her role in the upcoming seventh season: “I show up, time has passed and I have a 4-year-old and a wedding ring, [and I'm] calling Morris (Carlo Rota) while I'm busy. So far he's taking care of the baby, but he'll be around.\" \"We're a rogue operation – we are working outside of the government to uncover the conspiracy within the government.\" When asked by Matobo if she is a federal agent, she replies, \"No, I'm a stay-at-home-mom.\" She and Morris have named their son Prescott.\n\nKiefer Sutherland commented \"Chloe is crankier than ever; the dammit count is pretty high.\"\n\nChloe was working with Bill Buchanan and Tony Almeida who was undercover with Emerson's gang, to uncover the conspiracy within the US government who had been supporting General Juma and his regime in Sangala, Africa. Chloe co-ordinates numerous operations for the team, until later they become compromised through their efforts to secure the CIP device used by Juma's henchman, Dubaku to launch attacks on America. After this Chloe collaborates with the FBI, working from their headquarters in Washington.\n\nLater on, after Dubaku is captured and the threat seemingly ended, Jack is informed by Tony of another impending attack. Jack enlists Chloe's help while he follows a lead on Ryan Burnett — a US-based conspirator named as a traitor in the files retrieved from Dubaku. Jack asks Chloe to erase Burnett's name from the files to buy him time to get to Burnett and interrogate him. Janis Gold, one of the FBI's analysts, becomes suspicious of Chloe's and finds out what she has done. Janis reports her to Agent Larry Moss, who has Chloe arrested and detained. Chloe is later released when her husband Morris cuts an immunity deal for her, and the two go home to get some sleep. This plot development was partially to work around Rajskub's pregnancy. In earlier episodes, \"I sit behind my computer and every time I stand up, they yell cut, and bring in a body double.\" Chloe's arrest allowed her to be temporarily written out of the show so that Rajskub could go on maternity leave; meanwhile, Morris takes over her role in the story.\n\nChloe is called back into action by Jack at around 3:30 AM, when CTU's servers are dug out of storage and made available for FBI use; Chloe is (of course) the person best suited to integrating them and getting them running. Jack tells her that Tony has betrayed them, but (as of 4 AM) has not informed her of his own condition. Jack eventually informed her of his condition, but asked her to remain focused and help them find Tony and the pathogen. Thanks to Chloe's help, Jack is able to find and capture Tony. However, the tables are turned and Jack is kidnapped by Tony. When Kim recovers a laptop from one of Tony's lackeys, Chloe is able to track Jack's location and save him.\n\nAt the 7:30 am mark, Chloe has decided to stay and be there for Jack in his final hours.\n\nIn Season 8, Chloe is re-employed by the revived CTU, but is at times struggling with the new hardware, software and interfaces; dialogue between her and Head of CTU Brian Hastings (Mykelti Williamson) indicates that Morris has lost his job and Chloe is keeping the family afloat. She is also subordinate to Dana Walsh (Katee Sackhoff), who holds Chloe's usual position of Head Analyst, causing the insecure Chloe additional stress.\n\nChloe quickly goes head-to-head with her co-workers when evidence is uncovered that implicates journalist Meredith Reed (Jennifer Westfeldt) in an assassination plot against President Omar Hassan (Anil Kapoor). Chloe is suspicious of the ease with which CTU obtained this evidence, feeling that Reed might be being framed by actual conspirators. Hastings refuses to follow up on her suspicions, even threatening her job if she takes time to investigate, so she recruits Jack to do it instead. As it turns out, Chloe's instincts are proved correct, leading CTU to the actual assassin, and Hastings formally apologizes and commends her actions in the official logs. Later, after Dana's behavior in relation to former associate Kevin Wade (Clayne Crawford) affects her job performance, Chloe is then reinstated to Head Analyst, with Dana now reporting to her.\n\nIn the 183rd episode of the show (Season 8, 6:00 am – 7:00 am), Chloe surpassed Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard)'s episode count of 115, becoming the character who has appeared in the most episodes of the show other than Jack Bauer. Perhaps appropriately, just after 8 am that day, Chloe is promoted to (Acting) Director of CTU, replacing Hastings. This puts Chloe in an abnormal position in regard to Jack: normally she helps him carry out clandestine operations in defiance of their mutual boss, but now she \"is\" the boss he is defying. This new dynamic is put to the test within two hours of her promotion, when Jack steals a helicopter to pursue justice in direct defiance of orders from President Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones). Chloe sticks with the responsibilities of her position, ordering pursuit instead of supporting Jack; this is the first time in several years the two have pursued clashing goals.\n\nAt the end of the 8th season (3:00 pm to 4:00 pm), Chloe manages to talk Jack out of assassinating the Russian president in revenge of a friend's murder earlier that day and gets him to agree to expose the conspiracy her way. Jack orders Chloe to shoot him in order to free herself from suspicion and to expose the cover up of Hassan's murder. Chloe refuses to go through with it until Jack points the gun at his own head, forcing her to either shoot him or having him kill himself. She shoots him in the shoulder. Coordinating with Cole Ortiz, she tries to get evidence collected by Jack vital to expose the cover up, but is stopped by Jason Pillar and CTU. After Jack is saved from death by President Alison Taylor's order, he calls Chloe and makes her promise to protect Jack's family, and along with President Taylor, plans to buy him as much time as she can for him to flee the country before the Americans and Russians come after him for his actions. Jack thanks her for all she has done for him since she joined CTU and forgives her for her actions during the day. Chloe has the distinction of speaking the final line in the series by saying \"shut it down\" to Arlo Glass in regards to the CTU drone. As Jack looks one last time towards CTU's monitoring, Chloe gives one final tearful look to Jack in CTU's monitor screen before the clock counts down to zero.\n\nIn the Season 8 DVD bonuses, it is revealed that Chloe was arrested soon after the events of Day 8 by the FBI for covering up Jack's escape. She returned in the miniseries 24: Live Another Day, which started airing in May 2014.\n\nFour years after the end of Day 8, Chloe is situated in London and has taken to a new, darker appearance. Since being arrested for helping Jack escape, she has become a member of the free information movement and is working with a hacker group named Open Cell, which devotes itself to exposing government secrets. Her new goals are a stark contrast to the loyal CTU agent Chloe once was; it is suggested she was betrayed by the American government, at one point telling Jack not to judge her \"after what [she's] been through.\"\n\nAt the start of the miniseries, she was being detained by the CIA for leaking thousands of classified DOD documents. Jack, allowing himself to be captured to gain access to the facility, frees her and then follows her to the hideout of Open Cell's leader, hacker Adrian Cross (Michael Wincott). Chloe convinces her colleagues to assist Jack in locating Derrick Yates (Joseph Millson), a former member of their movement who Jack believes to be involved in a planned assassination attempt on President James Heller (William Devane). By this time, Yates had already managed to commandeer a U.S. drone and fire upon a military convoy in Afghanistan, killing two American and two British soldiers. Together, Jack and Chloe track Yates to an apartment complex, but are circumvented by the CIA's efforts to apprehend them. After losing Yates, Jack evades capture and escapes with Chloe.\n\nIn the show's third episode, Jack discovers Yates' corpse, left behind by his female companion, Simone Al-Harazi (Emily Berrington). Chloe loses sight of Al-Harazi after being distracted by a passing family, after which she reveals to Jack that Morris and Prescott were killed as a result of her knowledge of Jack's disappearance following Day 8. Together, they return to Open Cell's headquarters in order to establish a cover for Jack to infiltrate the U.S. embassy in London and question Lieutenant Chris Tanner (John Boyega), the man Yates had framed for the drone attack. However, Cross betrays Jack by botching Jack's cover; Chloe senses something amiss and warns him to escape, giving Jack enough time to create a diversion and enter the embassy.\n\nThroughout the rest of the day Chloe aids Jack as he searches for Margot Al-Harazi. Chloe manages to hack into Al-Harazi's video feed from her drone's cameras and fake President Heller's death and then track her with Adrian Cross' help. Jack kills Al-Harazi and stops an attack on Waterloo station, but Chloe refuses to have anything more to do with him, telling Jack it was good working with him again before rejoining Cross.\n\nAfter Cross receives the override device from Steve Navarro, Chloe tries to steal it but is forced by Cross to give it back. She is shocked to discover that Cross is working with Jack's old enemy Cheng Zhi who forces Chloe to fix the device and murders Cross who admits that he learned that the death of Morris and Prescott were actually an accident and he kept it from her so she wouldn't leave him. A horrified Chloe can only watch as Cheng uses the override device to order the sinking of a Chinese aircraft carrier by a United States submarine to spark a war between the two countries, but manages to leave a recording of Cheng behind so that Jack knows who is behind everything. As she is being transported, Chloe escapes and contacts Jack. Remorseful over her decisions, Chloe offers Jack her help in guiding him through Cheng's hideout, telling him she's the only friend he's got left. Reluctant to trust her, Jack agrees. Chloe runs satellite surveillance for Jack and Belcheck, but they lose contact with her shortly before Jack captures Cheng. Shortly afterwards, Jack gets a call from the Russians to trade himself for Chloe who they have kidnapped.\n\nThe next morning, Jack meets with the Russians and willingly trades himself for Chloe and his family's safety. Before leaving, Jack affirms that Chloe is his best friend and asks her to look after Kim. As Jack leaves with the Russians, a reluctant Chloe drives away with Belcheck.\n\nProject CHLOE, a Department of Homeland Security surveillance technology development program aimed at protecting airliners from terrorist missiles, was named after Chloe O'Brian because \"24\" is former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff's favorite show.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2076484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076484", "title": "Cyril Wecht", "text": "Cyril Wecht\n\nCyril Harrison Wecht (born March 20, 1931) is an American forensic pathologist. He has been a consultant in numerous high-profile cases, but is perhaps best known for his criticism of the Warren Commission's findings concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\nHe has been the president of both the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the American College of Legal Medicine, and headed the board of trustees of the American Board of Legal Medicine. He served as County Commissioner and Allegheny County Coroner and Medical Examiner serving the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.\n\nWecht was born to Jewish immigrant parents in a tiny mining village in Dunkard Township, Pennsylvania, called Bobtown. His father, Nathan Wecht, was a Lithuanian-born storekeeper; his Ukrainian-born mother, Fannie Rubenstein, was a homemaker and helped out in the store. When Wecht was young, Nathan moved the family first to McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, and then to the Hill District neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and opened a neighborhood grocery store. He attended and graduated from the now closed Fifth Avenue High School in Pittsburgh.\n\nWecht had musical leanings and was concertmaster of the University of Pittsburgh Orchestra during his undergraduate years. He earned a B.S. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1952, an M.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1956, an LL.B. from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1962, and a J.D. degree from the University of Maryland School of Law. After serving in the United States Air Force, he became a forensic pathologist. He served on the staff of St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh before becoming Deputy Coroner of Allegheny County in 1965. Four years later he was elected coroner. Wecht served as coroner from 1970 to 1980, and again from 1996 to 2006.\n\nWecht became famous appearing on television and consulting on deaths with a high media profile. Some of the cases include; Robert F. Kennedy, Sharon Tate, Brian Jones, the Symbionese Liberation Army shootout, John F. Kennedy, the Legionnaires' Disease outbreak, Elvis Presley, Kurt Cobain, JonBenét Ramsey, Dr. Herman Tarnower (the Scarsdale diet guru), Danielle van Dam, Sunny von Bülow, the Branch Davidian incident, Vincent Foster, Laci Peterson, Daniel and Anna Nicole Smith, and Rebecca Zahau. During his career, Wecht performed more than 14,000 autopsies. He is a clinical professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and an adjunct professor of law at Duquesne University. \n\nSince 1962, Wecht has had a private practice. He has served as a medical-legal and forensic pathology consultant in both civil and criminal cases. Wecht is consulted by both plaintiffs' and defense attorneys in civil cases, and by both prosecutors and defense attorneys in criminal cases in jurisdictions throughout the United States and abroad.\n\nHis forensic consultant engagements include:\n\nIn 1965 Wecht presented a paper critiquing the Warren Commission to the meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. In 1972 Wecht was the first civilian ever given permission to examine the Kennedy assassination evidence. It was Wecht who first discovered that Kennedy's brain, and all related data in the killing, had gone missing.\n\nIn 1978, he testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations as the lone dissenter on a nine-member forensic pathology panel re-examining the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which had concurred with the Warren Commission conclusions and single bullet theory. Out of the four official examinations into the Kennedy Assassination, Wecht is the only forensic pathologist who has disagreed with the conclusion that both the single bullet theory and Kennedy's head wounds are mutually consistent.\n\nWecht was hired by Callenders and Co, a Bahamian law firm, to do an independent autopsy on the body of Daniel Smith, the son of Anna Nicole Smith, who died while visiting his mother in the Bahamas. Wecht attested that Daniel Smith died as a result of the interaction of methadone, sertraline (Zoloft) and escitalopram (Lexapro).\n\nIn 2000, the Duquesne University School of Law established the Cyril H. Wecht Institute of Forensic Science and Law. The Institute offers graduate degree and professional certificate programs in forensic science to a diverse group of students spanning the disciplines of law, nursing, law enforcement, pharmacy, the health sciences, business, the environmental sciences and psychology.\n\nWecht has written numerous books, including: \n\nIn 1965, Wecht became Deputy Coroner of Allegheny County. Four years later he was elected Coroner of Allegheny County. Wecht served as coroner from 1970 to 1980. His initial departure from the office of Coroner was not met without controversy. Wecht did not resign as Coroner until January 9, two days after his swearing-in as an Allegheny County Commissioner, as the law did not prohibit him from holding both the offices of Coroner and Commissioner.\n\nHe resigned under pressure from a variety of sources, including his predecessor as Coroner, Dr. Ralph Stalter, a Republican, and the administration of Governor Dick Thornburgh, also a Republican. He initially recommended that Dr. Joshua Perper succeed him, and indeed Perper held the title of Acting Coroner until Thornburgh appointed Dr. Sanford Edburg to succeed Wecht. While Perper initially rejected the appointment as unconstitutional, the State Supreme Court upheld Thornburgh's right to appoint Edberg, who duly took over the office of Coroner on March 2, 1981.\n\nIn 1978, he was elected chairman of the Allegheny County Democratic Party. One year later, Wecht was elected to the Allegheny County Board of Commissioners. In 1982, he was the Democratic party's nominee to oppose freshman Senator John Heinz in bid for a second term; Heinz won the election with 59 percent of the vote.\n\nWecht and fellow Democratic County Commissioner Tom Foerster were frequently at odds, and battled for control of the Democratic Party in Allegheny County, which Wecht chaired. Although the Democratic Committee rejected Foerster and endorsed Wecht for re-election as commissioner in 1983, the committee paired him with Sheriff Gene Coon, with whom he also had a longstanding political feud. \n\nFoerster teamed up with former Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty, and the two defeated Wecht and Coon in the primary election for the two Democratic nominations. Wecht then lost the chairmanship of the county's Democratic Party in 1984 to Foerster's hand-picked candidate, Scott Township Tax Collector Ed Stevens. Wecht then sought to become chair of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party that same year, but was defeated by Ed Mezvinsky, a former Congressman from Iowa.\n\nIn 1995, Wecht, after 12 years out of public life, was again elected as Allegheny County's Coroner. In 1999, he ran for the newly created position of Allegheny County Chief Executive, defeating one-term minority County Commissioner Mike Dawida in the Democratic primary, but losing to prominent Republican businessman Jim Roddey in his first bid for elective public office.\n\nWhile serving as the county's coroner, Wecht continued to operate a private forensic consulting business on the side known as Wecht Pathology Associates. Wecht Pathology Associates charges clients for examining cases, conducting autopsies, and testifying in civil and criminal trials. In his official capacity as county coroner, Wecht continued to squabble with DA Zappala, often over deaths that took place during encounters with police.\n\nIn the case that is the precursor to Wecht's federal prosecution, US vs. Wecht, Wecht ruled that Charles Dixon had been suffocated through positional asphyxiation during a 2002 encounter with police officers from Mount Oliver and Pittsburgh. When Wecht ruled the death of Dixon a homicide, DA Zappala refused to press charges against the officers. In response, Wecht, acting in his private capacity as an employee of Wecht Pathology Associates, wrote a medical opinion outlining the officers' alleged role in Dixon's death which was utilized by Dixon's family in a civil suit against the county.\n\nIn response to Wecht's testimony in the Dixon case, Zappala accused Wecht of violating the federal Hobbs Act, which prohibits public officials from using their offices for private gain. In early 2005, Zappala launched an investigation into whether Wecht had been using county resources to carry out private work — allegations similar to those Wecht had faced before. By spring of 2005, FBI agents were seizing documents in Wecht's private and county offices.\n\nWecht continued to serve as Coroner until the position was eliminated in 2006. County Executive Dan Onorato named him as the county's first appointed Medical Examiner in 2006. By January 2006, a federal grand jury had indicted Wecht on 84 criminal counts, prompting Wecht to step down from his county post per an agreement he made when the investigation became public in 2004 that if indicted he would resign as county coroner.\n\nWecht's tenure as Allegheny County Coroner was controversial. While he was responsible for significant upgrades in the professionalism and technology of the coroner's office during his service in that office from 1970 to 1980, making the Allegheny County Coroner's office one of the best in the nation, Wecht's political career proved controversial due to his opinionated nature and as he put it his unwillingness to \"run away from a fight.\"\n\nIn 1979 Wecht was accused of performing autopsies for other counties at the county morgue and depositing the fees from these autopsies in his private business's bank account. Wecht responded that the funds in question had been used solely to upgrade the office and staff.\n\nAfter a long investigation, Wecht was indicted on multiple criminal counts that charged Wecht with personally profiting from work at the coroner's office. Wecht allegedly transacted approximately $400,000 of his private business work using county facilities and the county morgue. In spring 1981, the six-week-long criminal trial began. All charges were dismissed except for one, theft of services. Wecht was acquitted on the remaining charge.\n\nThe original judge at trial was censured by a judge's panel and some findings vacated due to judicial misconduct. Wecht's attorneys alleged that he was a victim of a political conspiracy.\n\nAlthough Wecht was acquitted in the criminal case, the County Controller levied a civil surcharge of $390,000 against him for mingling private and public work at the morgue. In 1983, a civil court ruled that Wecht owed the county $172,410. On appeal, the original award to the county was increased to $250,000. In 1992, the county and Wecht reached a settlement resulting in Wecht having to repay the county $200,000.\n\nOn January 28, 2008, a federal trial against Wecht began, on charges of public corruption. Roughly two weeks prior to the trial, 43 of the 84 counts against Wecht were withdrawn; judge Arthur J. Schwab dismissed those charges with prejudice. Following trial the jury could not reach agreement on the remaining counts, and the judge declared a mistrial. The prosecution immediately announced that they planned to retry Wecht.\n\nConcerns were raised about the motivation and conduct of the prosecution before and after the trial. Speculation arose that the prosecution of Wecht was politically motivated. Former Attorney General and Governor of Pennsylvania Dick Thornburgh, a defense lawyer for Wecht, testified before a House panel investigating the US Attorneys' Firing Scandal that Wecht was targeted politically.\n\nCongressmen Mike Doyle (whose district includes Pittsburgh) and John Conyers questioned the prosecution's tactics in the aftermath of the first trial and instituted Congressional hearings on the matter.\n\nOp-eds in The \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" and the \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\" called for dismissal of the proposed re-trial. On April 12, 2008, 33 prominent leaders in the Pittsburgh community sent a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey and US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan requesting that the prosecution dismiss the indictment against Wecht. Shortly after the press release of this letter, Senator Arlen Specter publicly recommended against a retrial for Wecht. Former jurors stated to the press that they believed that the prosecution had been politically motivated.\n\nOn May 5, 2008, the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) revealed that it initiated an investigation into the Wecht prosecution due to claims that the case was a \"selective prosecution\".\n\nOn May 14, 2009, a new trial judge in the retrial excluded most of the evidence against Wecht because it was seized under an illegal and improperly executed search warrant.\n\nOn June 2, 2009, Buchanan announced that her office would file a motion to dismiss all charges against Wecht.\n\nIn October 1961, Wecht married Sigrid Ronsdal; they have four children together, including David Wecht.\n\nIn March of 2020, one of Wecht's grandsons tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nOn May 16, 2020, Wecht promoted a less reactive and restrictive response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWecht was portrayed by Albert Brooks in the 2015 film \"Concussion\". In the film, Wecht was a staunch supporter of Bennet Omalu's efforts to expose the link between concussions and football.\n\n"}

Schaffer was co-chairman of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, and an outspoken leader in promoting American interests and human rights in Eastern Europe.\n\nSchaffer is currently Headmaster of Liberty Common High School, a school chartered by the Poudre School District based in Fort Collins, Colorado. Under Schaffer's leadership, the school beat the state's all-time record composite SAT (college readiness) score.\n\nIn 2004, Schaffer lost in the primary election to be the Republican nominee for a U.S. Senate seat. He was the Republican nominee for Colorado's other Senate seat in the 2008 election, which he lost to Democratic nominee Mark Udall.\n\nSchaffer was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and raised Catholic. He attended Archbishop Moeller High School.\n\nThe son of public-school teachers, Schaffer worked his way through college as a farm hand. In 1984, he graduated from the University of Dayton with a B.A. in Political Science. He was later awarded an honorary doctorate in Management from Colorado Technical University.\n\nSchaffer served for nine years as a Colorado State Senator in the Colorado General Assembly. Schaffer was only 25 years old in 1987 when he was appointed to finish Colorado State Senator Jim Beatty's term, making Schaffer the youngest to serve in Colorado's Senate. As a Colorado Senator, he was Chairman of the Finance Committee, the State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, and the Local Government Committee. Schaffer also was the Vice-Chairman of the Senate Education Committee. Schaffer was awarded the \"National Republican Legislator of the Year for 1995\" by the National Republican Legislators Association.\n\nIn 1993, Schaffer made headlines when he removed a display from the Capitol—that was in clear view of visiting children—that contained pamphlets describing \"unsafe sexual practices.\" \n\nSchaffer was first elected to the U.S. Congress in November 1996 representing Colorado's 4th congressional district, succeeding Wayne Allard and Hank Brown.\n\nSchaffer served three terms in Congress, fulfilling the three-term pledge he made during his first Congressional campaign.\n\nSchaffer upheld his pledge in spite of pleas from national Republicans and President George W. Bush to run for another term. Schaffer lead no less than four congressional delegations to Ukraine, and offered an ultimately unsuccessful balanced budget resolution and amendment. He was described as fiscally and socially conservative and to the right of the center of the party.\n\nHis education policy work focused on school-choice and local control, and Schaffer was remembered for being able to help his Republican colleagues form their arguments when debating this issue. He was succeeded by Marilyn Musgrave in January 2003. His congressional colleagues recount his tenure in congress as an education-policy expert.\n\nSchaffer is of Ukrainian heritage, the son of a Ukrainian immigrant to the United States. He has received multiple recognitions for his advocacy of Ukraine–United States relations, and for defense of Ukraine's territorial integrity under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Schaffer was co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus. Schaffer served as an election observer in Ukraine during parliamentary election 2002 and presidential election 2004 (“Orange Revolution”).\nThe American Conservative Union gave him a 100% evaluation in 2001.\n\nSince 2010, Schaffer has served as the inaugural principal of Liberty Common High School, a college-preparatory charter school in Fort Collins, Colorado. During his time at Liberty Common, the first four graduating classes posted the highest average composite ACT score in Colorado, with the class of 2015 breaking the state record. During the 2017 - 2018 school year, Schaffer was appointed as headmaster and Torgun Lovely, former vice-principal, replaced him as principal of the school.\n\nSchaffer was vice-president for business development at Aspect Energy, LLC., where he was involved in a variety of energy, mining and education projects, working primarily in wind energy. He was also a board member on the National Alternative Fuels Foundation, but environmental groups released attack ads during the 2008 U.S. Senate race highlighting Shcaffer's congressional vote which gave $2.5 billion to alternative energy research and a much larger amount to traditional energy research and tax credits.\n\nSchaffer served as president of the Parental Alliance for Choice in Education, a non-profit corporation promoting school choice reform in Colorado's public education system, and is active in the state's transformation to a market-driven education system.\n\nSchaffer has been chairman of the Leadership Program of the Rockies, a nonprofit corporation that provides economic education and civic-leadership training in Colorado. Schaffer is a regular columnist for the Fort Collins Coloradoan daily newspaper. Schaffer was also an opinion columnist for the now-defunct \"Northern Colorado Courier\".\n\nSince 2003, Schaffer has been chairman of Leadership Program of the Rockies, a nonprofit organization providing economic education and civic-leadership training in Colorado.\n\nIn March 2005, Schaffer was elected Republican National Committeeman for Colorado.\n\nSchaffer was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Colorado State Board of Education by a party vacancy committee, representing a district that is coterminous with the state's Fourth Congressional District. He successfully ran for the seat in 2006, against Democrat Tom Griggs. In January, 2009, Schaffer was made chairman of the Colorado State Board of Education with a unanimous decision of the four Republican and three Democratic board members. Fellow board members elected Schaffer to continue his chairmanship in 2011.\n\nAs Chairman of the Colorado State Board of Education, Schaffer borrowed ideas from Singapore and Finland when working to create new forward-thinking standards that are both internationally benchmarked and designed to grow students’ strategic thinking capabilities over fact memorization.\n\nCiting the importance of letting parents know if someone proximal to their children has been arrested, Schaffer took a leadership role in the effort to require parent notification if a school employee is arrested or charged with a serious crime. The measure went into effect in April 2011 despite strong opposition from the Colorado Education Association, the state-based teachers' unions.\n\nSchaffer maintained the position throughout the debating of the measure that parents are in the best position to make decisions about their children's safety. He voted against adopting Common Core standards, but the federal standards passed on a 4-3 vote. Adopting the standards were a keystone factor to the Colorado's application for $175 million in Race to the Top funds. In early 2011, Schaffer took heat from Democratic State Board of Education member Mary Johnson. The disagreement was over Schaffer's inviting William Maloney, Colorado education commissioner under both parties from 1997 to 2007, who spoke on “three incontestable realities concerning which America has been in denial for decades,” regarding America's education performance on a global scale, the unsustainable costs of education, and the availability of better models for the path forward.\n\nUnder Schaffer's chairmanship tenure, unanimous charter school guidelines were adopted. The new concrete rules adopted best practices for charter school authorization.\n\nHe is the Colorado Chairman of the Judicial Confirmation Network. In 2006, Schaffer founded Dreamsoft Colorado, LLC, a firm that creates high-end interactive websites for business and political clients. He is also the President of AMDG LLC. As a member of the Fort Collins, Colorado community, he owned a small business.\n\nIn 2004, Schaffer contended for the Republican nomination to the U.S. Senate after incumbent Republican Ben Nighthorse Campbell chose not to run for re-election. Brewing magnate Pete Coors opposed Schaffer. Coors entered the bitter primary battle after Schaffer faced down potential contenders such as David Liniger, founder of ReMax. The nomination battle concluded when Coors won the Republican nomination over Schaffer with 61% of the vote. Coors went on to lose to Democratic nominee Ken Salazar in the 2004 general election.\n\nSchaffer was the Republican nominee for the open seat of retiring Senator Wayne Allard. He lost to Mark Udall, the Democratic nominee.\n\nOn May 9, 2007, Schaffer filed his official statement of candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission. On May 12, 2007, he made an official announcement in Boulder that he would run for the Senate to a group of over 150 Republicans attending a fundraising event.\n\nOn September 28, 2008, Udall and Schaffer appeared on Meet the Press's \"Senate Debate\" series, discussing the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system.\n\nIn 2008, the League of Conservation Voters named Schaffer a member of its \"Dirty Dozen\" because of an anti-environmental record during his tenure in Congress.\n\nIn 2001, then-congressman Schaffer voted for President Bush's energy plan that Democrats argued was a $33 billion gift to the oil corporations. Republicans argued that the bill would help reduce America's dependence on foreign oil.\n\n\nSchaffer was allegedly linked to the Mariana Islands worker abuse scandal by his association with the Traditional Values Coalition, a non-profit Christian charity headquartered in Washington, D.C., which opposes abortion and advocates for religious freedom around the world. The organization was used by Jack Abramoff to pay for the trip of the then-Congressman to visit the island. The Denver Post reported that the TVC paid the $13,000 travel bill for the trip, organized by Abramoff's lobbying firm. Schaffer appeared visibly angry and expressed disgust with the Denver Post's reporting, asserting that the allegations were fiction and that he had no contact with the individuals in the report, particularly Jack Abramoff.\n\nThese accusations against Schaffer were spearheaded by Allen Stayman. Stayman leveled the unconfirmed and never proven Schaffer-Abramoff accusations at a press conference organized by Catholics United, an organization with ties to the Democratic Party and created John Podesta for the purpose of mobilizing Catholics into a socially progressive \"Catholic Spring.\"\n\nAbramoff's lobbying team would prepare questions and \"factual backup\" for friendly lawmakers. Trips to the island for congressmen and staff would be a key tool to \"build permanent friends,\" the memo said.\n\nThe congressional junkets to the Mariana Islands were designed to build support in Congress among Republican lawmakers to block labor and immigration legislation for the islands, which had been found to harbor squalid working conditions and abusive labor practices, including child prostitution and forced abortions.\n\nSchaffer claimed that he spoke with local clergy who denied there was a problem of forced abortions in the Northern Marianas, the only area of the United States where abortion is banned by their local constitution. After his return from the islands, Schaffer used his position on the Resources Committee to attack reports of abuses on the islands.\n\nUpon retiring from Congress in 2003, Schaffer was awarded the Benemerenti medal by Pope John Paul II. The Benemerenti Medal is an honour awarded by the Pope to members of the clergy and laity for service to the Catholic Church.\n\nSchaffer is a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem by confirmation of the Holy See in the name of and by the authority of Pope John Paul II. He is also a member of the Knights of Columbus, Council 1214 of Fort Collins, Colorado.\n\nDuring his 2008 Senate campaign, Schaffer suggested that the Northern Marianas' guest worker program might serve as a model for U.S. national immigration policy, stirring further controversy.\n\nSchaffer was particularly impressed with their pre-qualifying foreign workers before they were allowed to immigrate to the CNMI. According to a 1998 World magazine article that mainly sourced Andrea Sheldon of the TVC, some argued that the issues of the Northern Marianas labor, wage, and immigration laws are simply attacks by U.S.-based labor unions who are attempting to eliminate competition. Schaffer told the Denver Post, \"The workers were smiling; they were happy.\" Schaffer downplayed criticism from anti-abortion organizations that he participated in Abramoff's lobbying strategy to protect the sweatshop system by arguing, \"In five days, I did not observe a forced abortion or meet anybody who had any knowledge of them.\"\n\n"}

These institutions include four public research universities, eight state colleges and universities, fourteen private colleges and universities (two of which are classified as research universities), nineteen county colleges, fourteen religious institutions, and eight for-profit proprietary schools.\n\nNew Jersey was the only British colony to permit the establishment of two colleges in the colonial period. Princeton University, chartered in 1746 as the \"College of New Jersey\", and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, chartered on November 10, 1766 as \"Queen's College\", were two of nine colleges founded before the American Revolution. In the 1860s, these two colleges competed to become the state's land grant college under the terms of the Morrill Act of 1862 which provided land and funding to expand development of engineering, scientific, agricultural, and military education at one school in each state. Rutgers received the designation in 1864 began to expand instruction in these areas and taking on a hybrid private-public role that paved the way for its transformation into a state university in 1945. Today, Rutgers is a large public research university serving over 65,000 students. Princeton remained a private college and developed into a research university that is one of the nation's eight prestigious Ivy League schools.\n\nOn August 22, 2012, the New Jersey governor Chris Christie signed into law the \"New Jersey Medical and Health Science Education Restructuring Act\" which divided the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) between Rutgers and Rowan University, creating two public medical schools. According to \"The Star-Ledger\", the law gave Rutgers \"nearly all of UMDNJ—including its medical schools in Newark and Piscataway—in one of the greatest expansions in the state university's history\" and southern New Jersey's Rowan University would \"take over UMDNJ's osteopathic medical school in Stratford.\"\n\nThere are three law schools in the state accredited by the American Bar Association; two at Rutgers (at the university's Rutgers–Newark and Rutgers–Camden campuses respectively) and the other at Seton Hall Universitys campus in Newark.\n\nNew Jersey has a system of 19 public community colleges at the county level statewide. This reflects the fact that each college serves one of New Jersey's 21 counties, except for Atlantic Cape Community College and Raritan Valley Community College, each of which serves two counties. In 1989, the New Jersey Council of County Colleges was created to promote the advancement of the state's county community colleges. In 2003, governor James McGreevey created the New Jersey Community Colleges Compact, through Executive Order No. 81, as a statewide partnership to enable cooperation between the colleges and various state departments. The county colleges of New Jersey represent 56% of all undergraduate students in the state and offer studies in associate degree and certificate programs. Reflecting long-term trends nationwide, the male-to-female ratio of students in the system is 41% male to 59% female, and 48% of students are over the age of 24. Overall, the system enrolls more than 350,000 students each year on campuses that range in size from 1,300 students at Salem Community College to over 15,000 students at Bergen Community College.\n\nNot all of the county colleges were founded by the State of New Jersey; the oldest county college in New Jersey, Union County College, was founded in 1933 by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration as Union County Junior College; it operated as a private college from 1936 to 1982, and merged with the publicly operated Union County Technical Institute in 1982 to become the current public institution.\n\nTheological schools are typically classified as \"Special Topic Institutions\" by the Carnegie Foundation.\n\n\n"}

It has also been used for divination by arrows (which have wooden shafts) - otherwise known as belomancy. Less commonly it has been assigned to the I Ching, which traditionally uses a bundle of yarrow shoots. Another type of rhabdomancy is dowsing in its traditional form of using a wooden stick, usually forked.\n\nRhabdomancy has been used in reference to a number of Biblical verses. St Jerome connected Hosea 4:12, which reads \"My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them\" (KJV), to Ancient Greek rhabdomantic practices. Thomas Browne, in his \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\", notes that Ezekiel 21:21 describes the divination by arrows of Nebuchadnezzar II as rhabdomancy, though this can also be termed belomancy. Numbers 17 has also been attributed to rhabdomancy.\n\nW.F. Kirby, an English translator of the Kalevala, notes that in Runo 49, Väinämöinen uses rhabdomancy, or divination by rods, to learn where the Sun and Moon are hidden, but this interpretation is rejected by Aili Kolehmainen Johnson (1950).\n\nThe word first appears in English in the mid-17th century (used in Thomas Browne's \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\", 1646), where it is an adaptation of Late Latin \"rhabdomantia\", from a presumed (unrecorded) ancient Greek \"*rhabdomanteia\", from the ancient Greek ῥάβδος (\"rhabdos\") a rod. Liddell & Scott are \"dubious\" about the word's existence in Classical Greek, though the word is well attested in Patristic Greek. Note that none of the divinatory practices denoted by \"rhabdomancy\" in English are documented from ancient Greek sources.\n"}
{"id": "2076519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076519", "title": "Amores (Ovid)", "text": "Amores (Ovid)\n\nAmores is Ovid's first completed book of poetry, written in elegiac couplets. It was first published in 16 BC in five books, but Ovid, by his own account, later edited it down into the three-book edition that survives today. The book follows the popular model of the erotic elegy, as made famous by figures such as Tibullus or Propertius, but is often subversive and humorous with these tropes, exaggerating common motifs and devices to the point of absurdity.\n\nWhile several literary scholars have called the \"Amores\" a major contribution to Latin love elegy, they are not generally considered among Ovid's finest works and \"are most often dealt with summarily in a prologue to a fuller discussion of one of the other works\".\n\nSpeculations as to Corinna's real identity are many, if indeed she lived at all. It has been argued that she is a poetic construct copying the \"puella\"-archetype from other works in the love elegy genre. The name Corinna may have been a typically Ovidian pun based on the Greek word for \"maiden\", \"\"kore\"\".\n\nThough most of this book is rather tongue-in-cheek, some people didn't take it that way and this could be the reason or part of the reason why Ovid was banished from Rome. However, his banishment probably has more to do with the \"Ars Amatoria\", written later, which offended Augustus. There is also a connection between Ovid and Augustus' daughter, Julia, who was also exiled.\n\nThe\" Amores\" is a poetic first person account of the poetic \"persona's\" love affair with an unattainable higher class girl, Corinna. It is not always clear if the author is writing about Corinna or a generic puella. Ovid does not assume a single woman as a subject of a chronical obsession of the persona of lover. The plot is linear, with a few artistic digressions such as an elegy on the death of Tibullus.\n\n\nThe book has a ring arrangement, with the first and last poems concerning poetry itself, and 1.2 and 1.9 both contain developed military metaphors.\n\n\n3.1 - Ovid imagines being confronted by the personified 'Elegy' and 'Tragedy', who start to argue since Tragedy believes Ovid never stops writing elegies. Elegy responds by arguing her case, responding sarcastically to Tragedy that she should \"take a lighter tone\" and points out she is even using her (elegiac) metre to lament. Elegy seems to be victorious.\n\n3.2 - Ovid woos a girl at the races, despite perhaps only just having met her. Ovid seems to be very desperate - as shown by quickly making his move. The reader is left unsure whether his advances were truly accepted or whether Ovid (chooses to?) misinterpret the girl's rejections. \n\n3.3 - Ovid laments that his lover has not been punished for lying. He blames the gods for allowing beautiful women \"excessive liberties\" and for punishing and fighting against men. However, he then states that men need to \"show more spirit\" and if he was a god, he would do the same as them, with respect to beautiful women.\n\n3.4 - Ovid warns a man about trying to guard his lover from adultery. He justifies this through a commentary on forbidden love and its allure.\n\n3.5 - Ovid has a dream about a white cow that has a black mark. The dream symbolises an adulterous woman who now has been forever stained by the mark of adultery.\n\n3.6 - Ovid describes a river preventing him from seeing his lover. He compares then compares it to other rivers in Graeco-Roman mythology, and their associated myths such as the Inachos and the Asopus.\n\n3.7 - Ovid complains of erectile dysfunction.\n\n3.8 - Ovid laments over his lover's avarice, complaining that poetry and the arts are now worth less than gold.\n\n3.9 - An elegy for the dead Tibullus.\n\n3.10 - The Festival of Ceres prevents Ovid from making love to his mistress. Characteristically of Ovid, he complains he should not be held responsible for the gods' mistakes.\n\n3.11a - Ovid has freed himself from the shackles of his lover. He is ashamed of what he did for her and his embarrassment in standing outside her door. She exploited him, therefore he has ended it.\n\n3.11b - The poet is conflicted. He loves and lusts after his lover but acknowledges her evil deeds and betrayals. He wishes she were less attractive so he can more easily escape her grasp.\n\n3.12 - Ovid laments that his poetry has attracted others to his lover. He questions why his descriptions of Corinna were interpreted so literally, when poets sing of stories of fiction or, at least, embellished fact. He stresses the importance of this poetic licence.\n\n3.13 - Ovid describes the Festival of Juno, which is taking place in the town of his wife's birth, Falsica (Falerii), and its origins. He finishes the poem hoping Juno will favour both him and the townspeople.\n\n3.14 - Ovid instructs his partner to not tell him about her affairs. Instead, although he knows he cannot keep her to himself, he wants her to deceive him so that he can pretend not to notice.\n\n3.15 - Ovid bids farewell to love elegy.\n\nOvid's \"Amores\" are firmly set in the genre of love elegy. The elegiac couplet was used first by the Greeks, originally for funeral epigrams, but it came to be associated with erotic poetry. Love elegy as a genre was fashionable in Augustan times. \n\nFamiliar themes include:\n\nIt has been regularly praised for adapting and improving on these older models with humour.\n\nThe poems contain many allusions to other works of literature beyond love elegy.\n\nPoems 1.1 and 1.15 in particular both concern the way poetry makes the poet immortal, while one of his offers to a lover in 1.3 is that their names will be joined in poetry and famous forever.\n\nOvid's love elegies stand apart from others in the genre by his use of humour.\n\n\"Amores\" I.1 begins with the same word as the \"Aeneid\", \"\"Arma\"\" (an intentional comparison to the epic genre, which Ovid later mocks), as the poet describes his original intention: to write an epic poem in dactylic hexameter, \"with material suiting the meter\" (line 2), that is, war. However, Cupid \"steals one (metrical) foot\" (\"unum suripuisse pedem\", I.1 ln 4), turning it into elegiac couplets, the meter of love poetry.\n\nOvid returns to the theme of war several times throughout the \"Amores\", especially in poem nine of Book I, an extended metaphor comparing soldiers and lovers (\"Militat omnis amans\", \"every lover is a soldier\" I.9 ln 1).\n\nOvid's popularity has remained strong to the present day. After his banishment in 8 AD, Augustus ordered Ovid's works removed from libraries and destroyed, but that seems to have had little effect on his popularity. He was always \"among the most widely read and imitated of Latin poets. Examples of Roman authors who followed Ovid include Martial, Lucan, and Statius.\n\nThe majority of Latin works have been lost, with very few texts rediscovered after the Dark Ages and preserved to the present day. However in the case of \"Amores\", there are so many manuscript copies from the 12th and 13th centuries that many are “textually worthless”, copying too closely from one another, and containing mistakes caused by familiarity. Theodulph of Orleans lists Ovid with Virgil among other favourite Christian writers, while Nigellus compared Ovid's exile to the banishment of St. John, and imprisonment of Saint Peter. Later in the 11th century, Ovid was the favourite poet of Abbot (and later Bishop) Baudry, who wrote imitation elegies to a nun - albeit about Platonic love. Others used his poems to demonstrate allegories or moral lessons, such as the 1340 \"\" which was translated with extensive commentary on the supposed moral meaning of the \"Amores\". Wilkinson also credits Ovid with directly contributing around 200 lines to the classic courtly love tale \"Roman de la Rose\".\n\nChristopher Marlowe wrote a famous verse translation in English.\n\n\n"}

The medal was physically identical in all realms where it was awarded, save for Canada, where it contained unique elements. As an internationally distributed award, the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal holds a different place in each country's order of precedence for honours.\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal was created by a Royal Warrant from the Queen.\n\nUntil 1977, the practice for coronation and jubilee medals was for the United Kingdom authorities to decide on a total number of medals to be produced and allocate how many were to be distributed by each Dominion and possession across the British Empire, and later, to each Commonwealth country. From 1977, the award of the medals was at the discretion of each national government. Thus, 30,000 were distributed in Britain, 1,507 in New Zealand, 6,870 in Australia, and 30,000 in Canada.\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in the UK was designed by David Wynne. It is in the form of a diameter silver disc with, on the obverse, the words \"ELIZABETH II DEI GRA. REGINA FID. DEF.\" (Latin abbreviation for \"Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, Queen, Defender of the Faith\") surrounding an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, symbolising her role as fount of honour. On the reverse is a crown atop a wreath that contains the words \"THE 25th YEAR OF THE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II 6 February 1977\" in six lines.\n\nThe Canadian version has a number of differences, with the medal slightly thicker and the crown on the Queen's effigy more upright. The reverse has a distinct design, and bears a stylised maple leaf with \"CANADA\" above and the Royal Cypher below, flanked with the dates \"1952\" and \"1977\".\n\nBoth versions of the medal are worn on the left chest, suspended from a brooch bar on a wide white ribbon with cardinal red bands along the edges, each 1mm wide, and a 7mm wide garter blue stripe down the centre, bisected by another 1mm wide line of cardinal red; the colours carried on the tradition for jubilee medals. Women may wear the medal near the left shoulder with the ribbon tied in a bow. Like the Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal and Queen's Police Medal, ribbon bars are also available. The medal, which came with a certificate, was awarded unnamed.\nThe Canadian medal was intended to award individuals who had been deemed to have made a significant contribution to their fellow citizens, their community or to Canada. So that all regions of the country would be recognised equally, the federal, provincial, and civic governments all forwarded names to Rideau Hall, as did private organisations in the fields of the arts, sports, philanthropy, and charity. The full membership of the Order of Canada and Order of Military Merit, as well as all recipients of Canadian Bravery Decorations received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal automatically, while for members of the Canadian Forces, merit with length of service and prestige of current appointment was considered.\n\nThe 30,000 medals awarded within the United Kingdom included 9,000 to armed forces personnel, with others given to members of the Royal Household and to people engaged in a wide range of activities, including industry, trade, local services, voluntary work, the arts, entertainment and sport.\n\nSome orders of precedence are as follows:\n\nThe following list includes notable New Zealanders who received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and is not an exhaustive list of recipients.\n"}

The district's current Representative is Roger Williams.\n\nFor the 2004 elections, it had an elongated shape stretching from deep south Texas at the U.S.-Mexico border to Austin (informally known as \"the fajita strip\") as a result of mid-decade 2003 gerrymandering of Texas congressional districts.\n\nThe district was redrawn again for the 2006 elections as the result of a lawsuit (see below).\n\nIn July 2011, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed into law a redistricting plan (\"C185\"), approved by the Texas legislature in June, which gave the 25th district a completely different geography for the 2012 elections, including part of Travis County, and stretching north as far as southern Tarrant County near Fort Worth. The redistricting split Travis County into five districts, four of which were heavily Republican. As a result, the only realistic place for Representative Lloyd Doggett to run was the new 35th district (which by weight of population is more of a San Antonio district than an Austin district).\n\nFor a number of years, there was a consolidated lawsuit against the redistricting. In March 2017, a panel of federal judges ruled that the new 35th district and two others were illegally drawn with discriminatory intent. However, the district was allowed to stand in the Supreme Court's 2018 Abbott v. Perez ruling.\n\nOn June 28, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the Texas legislature's 2003 redistricting plan violated the Voting Rights Act in the case of the 23rd district. The main basis for the ruling was that the old 23rd was a protected majority-Hispanic district—in other words, if the 23rd was redrawn in a way to put Hispanics in a minority, a new majority-Hispanic district had to be created. Since the 25th was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement, the 23rd had to be struck down. The size of the 23rd required the redrawing of nearly every district from El Paso to San Antonio.\n\nAs a result, on August 4, 2006, a three-judge panel announced replacement district boundaries for 2006 election for the 23rd district, as well as for the 15th, 21st, 25th and 28th districts. On election day in November, these five districts held open primaries; if any candidate received over 50%, they were elected. Otherwise, a runoff election in December decided the seat.\n\nThe redrawn 25th was more compact and restricted to Central Texas, comprising more of Travis County, most of Bastrop County, and all of Hays, Caldwell, Fayette, Gonzales, Lavaca, and Colorado Counties.\n\nIncumbent congressman Doggett faced Republican Grant Rostig (formerly the Libertarian nominee), independent candidate Brian Parrett, and Libertarian Party Barbara Cunningham, and won re-election.\n\nIn the 2008 election Doggett faced Republican George Morovich, a structural engineer from La Grange and Libertarian Jim Stutsman, a retired Army veteran. Doggett won with 65.8% of the vote to Morovich's 30.5% and Stutsman's 3.7%. Doggett won 73.8% of the vote in his Austin-based stronghold of Travis County.\n\nDogget faced Republican and \"Tea Party favorite\" Donna Campbell, and again held his seat, though by a surprisingly small margin.\n\nThe new district boundaries were more favorable to Republicans, as had been foreseen.\n\n"}

On March 16, 2007, the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of Higher Education voted to change the name of the school to its current name College of Southern Nevada on July 1, 2007.\n\nCollege of Southern Nevada has three main campuses in the Las Vegas Valley: the Charleston Campus, North Las Vegas Campus and Henderson Campus. There are also eight learning centers: Moapa Valley, Summerlin, Mesquite, Green Valley, Western, Sahara West, Las Vegas City Hall and Nellis Air Force Base.\n\nThe current president of CSN is Dr. Federico Zaragoza, who was unanimously selected by the Nevada System of Higher Education Board of Regents.\n\nProvost\nHenderson\nPatty Charlton\nNLV\nTBA\nWest Charleston\nTBA\n\nCSN provides job training in more than 70 academic programs with more than 180 degrees certificates available. The college also offers seven bachelor's degrees. The majority of students, 73.5 percent or 25,301, attend part-time and 26.5 percent or 9,108 students attend full-time.\n\nCSN's undergraduate degrees have received regional accreditation from Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities since 1975.\n\nDepartment of Computing and Information Technology; Department of Media Technologies and Department of Applied Technologies\nDepartment of Communications; Department of English; Department of Fine Arts; Department of International Languages and Performing Arts Center\nDepartment of Accounting, Finance, Computer Office Technology; Department of Business Administration; Paralegal Studies; Department of Hospitality Management; Department of Public Safety and Human Services; Police Academy and Fire Technologies\nDepartment of Education; Department of Human Behavior and Department of Social Sciences\nDepartment of Dental Science, Diagnostic Evaluation and Rehabilitation Services; Department of Health Related Professions and Department of Nursing\nDepartment of Biological Sciences; Department of Mathematics and Department of Physical Sciences\nAdult Literacy and Language; American Heart and Healthcare Programs; Apprenticeship; Business Assessment and Consulting; Community Programs and Personal Enrichment; Construction; Education and Government; EMS; Occupational Health and Safety Programs.\n\nIn fall 2014, 36.1 percent of students were Caucasian, 26.7 percent Hispanic, 10.3 percent Asian and 11.7 percent African American. Nationally the college enrolls students from 48 states in more than 3,000 classes each semester.\n\nThe College of Southern Nevada Coyotes compete in the Scenic West Athletic Conference of the NJCAA's Division I. The school currently has five athletic programs—men's baseball, men's soccer, women's softball, women's volleyball, and women's soccer. Baseball's first season was in 2000, and softball began its first season in 2004. Volleyball was added in 2014. Men and Women's Soccer started in Fall of 2016 and campus-wide improvements will be coming to all three campuses (including the Henderson Campus, where Athletics will be headquartered).\n\nThe Coyotes baseball team was the first intercollegiate athletics program at CSN. The Coyotes' home field, William R. Morse Stadium, is located at CSN's Henderson campus in Henderson, Nevada.\n\nOn March 18, 1999, CSN hired its first baseball coach—local legend Rodger Fairless, who coached former MLB pitchers Greg Maddux and Mike Maddux at Valley High School during the 1980s, and was more well known for coaching Green Valley High School to six consecutive Nevada state baseball championships from 1993-98. But, before Fairless would even conduct his first baseball practice at CSN, he stepped down on May 4, 1999, citing health reasons. Fairless would be replaced by another local veteran coach, Tim Chambers, on July 8, 1999.\n\nThe Coyotes played their first-ever game on February 1, 2000, against Scottsdale Community College, and quickly grew into a perennial contender. They joined the Scenic West Athletic Conference in 2002, quickly asserting themselves a place in the conference, becoming rivals with Dixie State College until the Trailblazers moved up to NCAA Division II in 2006. Since joining the SWAC, CSN has won six conference championships, two Region XVIII championships and two Western District championships. Today, the Coyotes' rivals are the Western Nevada Wildcats, as they are the only two junior colleges in Nevada to have intercollegiate athletics, and also fueled by their fierce battles on the diamond.\n\nOn May 31, 2003, the Coyotes made history, defeating the heavily favored San Jacinto-North Gators 4-1 to win the 2003 National Junior College World Series in only their fourth year of existence. It is CSN's only national championship in any sport to date.\n\nIn 2010, catcher Bryce Harper was selected first overall by the Washington Nationals in the Major League Baseball First Year Player Draft after a season in which he batted .443/.526/.987 (AVG/OBP/SLG) with 98 runs scored, 31 home runs, 98 RBIs, 20 SBs, and a 1.510 OPS, leading the team to a third-place finish at the National Junior College World Series. He was selected as an outfielder.\n\nOn June 11, 2010, just one week after the Coyotes had been eliminated from the JUCO World Series, longtime head coach Tim Chambers took the head coaching job at UNLV. There would be no vacancy for long though, as CSN hired former Bishop Gorman High School baseball coach Chris Sheff on July 9, 2010, to carry on the legacy that Chambers built.\n\nSheff would become the second baseball coach in CSN history to never coach a game. Allegations of illegal activity in the eyes of the NJCAA and parents alike came up, and on November 3, 2010, the school decided to relieve Sheff of his duties.\n\nSix days later, on November 9, 2010, CSN hired former Green Valley High School coach Nick Garritano as its head baseball coach. Garritano, who was Fairless' successor at Green Valley, won two state championships during his 12 years at the helm, producing a 315-118-1 record. He played sports at Chaparral High School and was inducted into the UNLV Hall of Fame as a former place-kicker for the football team.\n\nOn May 5, 2012, the baseball clubhouse was officially named after James B. Whiteaker in a dedication ceremony that took place prior to the final baseball game of the regular season. Today, \"Building D\" is now known as the James B. Whiteaker Clubhouse.\n\n2015 Coyotes Baseball was an exciting year of competition. The Coyotes sported RHP – Phil Bickford (2015-drafted to SF Giants), SS – Tyler Brown (2015 – drafted to SF Giants), and OF-Matthew Waldren, who was a 2015 NJCAA Superior Academic-All-American.\n\nCoyotes Athletic Programs pride themselves on maintaining very high individual and team academic standards. Student-athletes at the College of Southern Nevada regularly attend and accomplish 17–21 credits per semester, averaging individual GPAs as high as 3.9.\n\nFall 2015 was the inaugural season hosting Women's Volleyball.\n\nThe College of Southern Nevada now houses Men's and Women's Division I Soccer; their first season was Fall of 2016.\n\nMen's soccer is Coached by Geoffrey Hawkins, Esq., Christopher Burgess, and Julian Portugal. In their first season of competition they made their way to the 2016 NJCAA DIV. I, Men's Soccer Championship in Tyler, TX. They were defeated by #2 ranked Monroe College.\n\nWomen's soccer adopted Head Coach Rob Dahl of Utah to lead them to victory. Rob is a championship collegiate-level ladies soccer coach and is planning for the ladies to head for the Finals during his first year of 2017. The ladies are mixed with local Las Vegas and Utah talents.\n\n\n\nThe Coyotes softball team debuted in the spring of 2004. The Coyotes' home field is located at the Russell Road Recreation Complex, a park operated by the City of Henderson. Talks are in the works to build a softball stadium on the CSN Henderson campus, adjacent to the baseball stadium, with funding being its major obstacle.\n\nThe program's first coach was Ric Grenell, who previously had coached women's soccer at CSN from 2000-02 before the sport was discontinued.\n\nAfter a moderate first season record of 16-30, the 2005 softball team did less well, winning only six games. Shortly after the 2006 season began, another rough start prompted Grenell to resign, and Ysidro Jimenez took over as interim head coach. Jimenez would become the permanent head coach at season's end, and remained the head coach until June 2011.\n\nUnder Jimenez, CSN softball enjoyed five winning seasons from 2007–11, including a record 38 wins in the 2011 season. But, after failing to win a conference or region championship, then-assistant coach and former longtime Hawaii-Hilo softball coach Callen Perreira was announced as Jimenez's replacement, and officially took over the helm on July 1, 2011.\n\nIn Spring of 2017, CSN welcomed the addition of the new Lady Coyotes Softball Complex at the Henderson Campus. Softball also welcomed Head Coach Jim Overturf and Olympian Lori Harrigan-Mack.\n\n\n"}

On the electrode surface, many atoms, molecules, and ions adsorb and affect the reactions. In the past, in order to obtain information about the structure of electrode surfaces and reactions, the sample electrode was taken out of the electrolytic solution and measured under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions. In this case, the structure of the surface changed and could not be observed precisely. By using this microscope, however, these problems are resolved.\nIn electrolytic solutions, a complicated electrical double layer of HO molecules and anions is formed. In this layer, as the distribution of anions changes with the potential of the electrode, it is necessary to control the reaction on the electrode. The potentials of the working electrodes (the sample and the tip) are controlled independently against a reference electrode. In this case, the tunneling bias voltage is the difference between the two potentials. A counter electrode is used to complete the current-carrying circuits with the working electrodes. By using these four electrodes, the electrochemical reaction is controlled precisely by the external voltage, and the surface in liquid can be observed.\n"}

Smith\n\nArthur James Marshall Smith (November 8, 1902 – November 21, 1980) was a Canadian poet and anthologist. He \"was a prominent member of a group of Montreal poets\" – the Montreal Group, which included Leon Edel, Leo Kennedy, A. M. Klein, and F. R. Scott — \"who distinguished themselves by their modernism in a culture still rigidly rooted in Victorianism.\"\n\nSmith was born in Montreal, but lived in England from 1918 to 1920, where he \"studied for the Cambridge Local Examinations, 'and failed everything except English and history' (he later wrote).\" In England he became aware of contemporary poetry: \"he frequented Harold Monroe's bookshop, then the citadel of Georgian poetry, and read much in the recent war poets and the Imagists.\"\n\nReturning to Montreal, Smith entered McGill University in 1921. While an undergraduate there in 1924 he wrote for and co-edited the \"McGill Daily Literary Supplement\"; in 1925, as a graduate student, he and F. R. Scott founded the \"McGill Fortnightly Review\", which billed itself as \"an independent journal of literature, the arts, and student affairs edited and published by a group of undergraduates at McGill University.\" The \"Review\" was \"the first journal to publish modernist poetry and critical opinion in Canada.\"\n\n\"The \"McGill Fortnightly\" drew to it other young writers – among them A. M. Klein, Leo Kennedy, and Leon Edel – on whom, as well as on Scott, Smith had an enduring influence.\"\n\n\"While still at McGill,\" Scott later noted, \"Smith had poems accepted by the \"Dial\", then in the last days of its glory as an expounder of new aesthetic values, and which only a few years previously had printed Eliot's \"Waste Land\". Such an honour was a stimulus to our whole group.\"\n\nSmith received his doctorate from the University of Edinburgh in 1931.\n\nIn various editorial roles, Smith significantly contributed to promoting the poetry of others. With Scott and Kennedy he co-edited the \"milestone selection of modernist verse,\" \"New Provinces\", which was published in 1936 (although Smith's Preface was \"rejected by the publisher as being too impatient with traditional Canadian poetry. The 'Rejected Preface' was resurrected in 1964, and was made an important feature of the new edition of \"New Provinces\" published in 1976.\")\n\nIn 1936 Smith became a professor at Michigan State College (now Michigan State University) and taught there until his retirement in 1972.<ref name=\"Biography/History\">\"Biography/History,\" Arthur James Marshall Smith fonds, Trent University Archives. Web, Mar. 13, 2011.</ref> \"He became a naturalized American, but spent all his summers in his country place near Magog, Quebec.\" He became well known as both a scholar and an author of poetry, with many of his best known works focusing on Canadian themes (for example his 1929 poem \"The Lonely Land,\" which was inspired by a 1926 Group of Seven exhibition).\n\nAs early as 1939, Smith applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship to support the preparation of an anthology of Canadian poetry. In 1943 his first anthology was published: \"The Book of Canadian Poetry\", in which he argued that there was a distinctive Canadian voice. The book was praised by literary critic Northrop Frye, who called its publication \"an important event in Canadian literature. For instead of confining his reading to previous compilations, as most anthologists do, he has made a first-hand study of the whole English field with unflagging industry and unfaltering taste.\" \"The Encyclopædia Britannica\" says that \"The Book of Canadian Poetry\", and Smith's later anthologies, \"contributed greatly to the modernization of literary standards in Canada.\n\nSmith won the 1943 Governor General's Award for English-language poetry or drama for his own first collection of poetry, \"News of the Phoenix and Other Poems\".\n\nIn 1966 the Royal Society of Canada awarded him its Lorne Pierce Medal.\n\nOn Smith's retirement in 1972, Michigan State University established the A.J.M. Smith Award, given annually to a noteworthy volume by a Canadian poet.\n\nSmith's poem \"The Lonely Land\" was set to music by Violet Archer in 1978.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was formerly the Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls and later the Mississippi State College for Women. Men have been admitted to MUW since 1982 and now make up about 20% of the student body.\n\nUpon its establishment in 1884, Mississippi University for Women became the first public women's college in the United States. Then formally titled the Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls, the institution was created by an act of the Mississippi Legislature on March 12, 1884, for the dual purposes of providing a liberal arts education for women and preparing them for employment. The first session began October 22, 1885, with an enrollment of approximately 250 students on a campus formerly occupied by the Columbus Female Institute, a private college founded in 1847. Richard Jones was selected by the State Institutions of Higher Learning board of trustees as the university's first president.\n\nThe name of the institution changed to Mississippi State College for Women in 1920 to reflect an emphasis on collegiate, rather than vocational, education.\n\nIn 1966, three local women from Hunt High School became the first black undergraduates at MUW. They lived off campus, as the dormitories remained segregated until 1968. At the same time, three teachers from Hunt became the first graduate students at the school. The students were known collectively as The Fabulous Six.\n\nIn 1971 Mississippi State College for Women won the intercollegiate women's basketball national championship (the third ever held).\n\nIn 1974 the name was changed to the Mississippi University for Women to reflect the expanded academic programs, including graduate studies. All other Mississippi state colleges were also designated universities at this time.\n\nIn 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of \"Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan\" that the nursing school's single-sex admissions policies were in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Following this decision, the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning ordered the university to change its policies to allow the admission of qualified males into all university programs. In 1988, the Board of Trustees reaffirmed the mission of MUW as an institution providing quality academic programs for all qualified students, with emphasis on distinctive opportunities for women.\n\nIn a 1997 article in \"Innovative Higher Education\", the journalist Dale Thorn describes MUW's successful attempt to avoid a merger with another institution and to remain a separate entity.\n\nIn 2009, President Dr. Claudia Limbert announced the possibility of changing the university's name to \"Reneau University\". The Mississippi State legislature did not approve the change.\n\nAs of 2018, U.S. News & World Report ranked The W 11th as a best value among public Southern regional universities and tied at 20th among best public regional universities in the South. The W also appeared in U.S. News’ Best Colleges for Veterans in Southern regional universities at No. 40.\n\nOn February 1, 2019, Nora Roberts Miller, was inaugurated as the first alumna president of Mississippi University for Women.

Typically, hearing loss is gradual, and often detected by family and friends of the people so affected long before the patients themselves will acknowledge the disability.\n\nIn some cases, the loss is extremely sudden and can be traced to specific diseases, such as meningitis, or to ototoxic medications, such as Gentamicin. In both cases, the final degree of loss varies. Some experience only partial loss, while others become profoundly deaf. Hearing aids and cochlear implants may be used to regain a sense of hearing, with different people experiencing differing degrees of success. It is possible that the affected person may need to rely on speech-reading and/or sign language for communication.\n\nIn most cases the loss is a long term degradation in hearing loss. Discrediting earlier notions of presbycusis, Rosen demonstrated that long term hearing loss is usually the product of chronic exposure to environmental noise in industrialized countries (Rosen, 1965). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has asserted the same sentiment and testified before the U.S. Congress that approximately 34 million Americans are exposed to noise pollution levels (mostly from roadway and aircraft noise) that expose humans to noise health effects including the risk of hearing loss (EPA, 1972).\n\nCertain genetic conditions can also lead to post-lingual deafness. In contrast to genetic causes of pre-lingual deafness, which are frequently autosomal recessive, genetic causes of post-lingual deafness tend to be autosomal dominant.\n\nIn cases where the causes are environmental, the treatment is to eliminate or reduce these causes first of all, and then to fit patients with a hearing aid, especially if they are elderly. When the loss is due to heredity, total deafness is often the end result. On the one hand, persons who experience gradual deterioration of their hearing are fortunate in that they have learned to speak. Ultimately the affected person may bridge communication problems by becoming skilled in sign language, speech-reading, using a hearing aid, or accepting elective surgery to use a prosthetic devices such as a cochlear implant.\n\nThose who lose their hearing later in life, such as in late adolescence or adulthood, face their own challenges. For example, they must adjust to living with the adaptations that make it possible for them to live independently. They may have to adapt to using hearing aids or a cochlear implant, develop speech-reading skills, and/or learn sign language. The affected person may need to use a TTY, a videophone, an interpreter, or relay service to communicate over the telephone. Loneliness and depression can arise as a result of isolation (from the inability to communicate with friends and loved ones) and difficulty in accepting their disability. The challenge is made greater by the need for those around them to adapt to the person's hearing loss.\n\n\n"}

He played for the Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins and Calgary Flames in the National Hockey League (NHL). Kennedy was drafted by the Red Wings in the fourth round of the 1988 NHL Entry Draft while playing with the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League (WHL). In the WHL, Kennedy helped the Broncos capture the 1989 Memorial Cup, and was named to the tournament all-star team. Kennedy represented Canada internationally at the World Junior Championships in 1988 and 1989. He helped Canada win a gold medal at the 1988 tournament. Kennedy was born in Brandon, Manitoba, but grew up in Elkhorn, Manitoba.\n\nKennedy is known for going public as a victim of sexual abuse by his coach, Graham James. In 1998, Kennedy roller bladed across Canada to raise awareness and funds for sexual abuse victims. Currently, Kennedy serves as a spokesperson for violence and abuse prevention programs with the Canadian Red Cross. He was honoured by Hockey Canada in 2020, with the Order of Hockey in Canada.\n\nKennedy started playing junior hockey with the Winnipeg South Blues of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) in 1985. After being noticed by Graham James at a hockey camp, Kennedy joined the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League (WHL) for the 1986–87 season. He spent the rest of his WHL career with the Broncos, helping the team capture the 1989 Memorial Cup. For his play during the tournament, Kennedy was named to the Memorial Cup All-Star Team. He was also named to the WHL's Eastern Conference Second All-Star Team. Kennedy along with fellow future NHLer Joe Sakic, was a passenger in the Swift Current Broncos bus crash that occurred in December 1986, killing four members of the team.\n\nKennedy was selected by the Detroit Red Wings in the fourth round (80th overall) of the 1988 National Hockey League (NHL) Entry Draft. His first professional season was split between the Red Wings in the NHL and their minor league affiliate Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League (AHL). At the NHL level, Kennedy scored two goals and added seven assists in 20 games. Kennedy spent the next four seasons bouncing between the AHL and NHL within the Red Wings organization. The Winnipeg Jets acquired Kennedy from the Red Wings after the 1993–94 season. The NHL lock-out meant that Kennedy did not play for the Jets before being picked up on waivers by the Calgary Flames. Kennedy spent two seasons in Calgary, then the Flames decided not to renew his contract in 1996, shortly after his sexual abuse revelation. He signed as a free agent with the Boston Bruins for the 1996–97 season but also spent time with the Providence Bruins, Boston's AHL affiliate. The 1996–97 season was Kennedy's last campaign in the NHL but he later resurfaced in the 1998–99 season with the Manitoba Moose of the now-defunct International Hockey League. Kennedy also played for EV Landshut of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany during the 1998–99 season.\n\nKennedy devoted his post hockey career to child abuse prevention and education. Along with his business partner, Wayne McNeil, he owns and operates Respect Group Inc. which provides training to thousands of people with messages and tools of empowerment to help people involved in amateur sport and education systems prevent bullying, harassment, and abuse.\n\nOn June 15, 2012 Kennedy was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Fraser Valley for his work supporting victims of child abuse and promoting education and awareness of the topic. On June 8, 2015 Kennedy was awarded with an Honorary degree, Doctor of Laws, from the University of Calgary for his extraordinary commitment to violence and abuse prevention programs in Canada.\n\nOn April 13, 2013 the Calgary Child Advocacy Centre was renamed the Sheldon Kennedy Child Advocacy Centre at an ceremony hosted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The centre provides services to children and their families using a coordinated, multi-disciplinary approach. The Centre houses 95 professionals from Calgary Police Services, Alberta Health Services, Child and Family Services, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Alberta Education and crown prosecutors who work together to assess, treat, and seek justice for physically and sexually abused children. Sheldon Kennedy serves as a Board member.\n\nKennedy was named as a Member of the Order of Canada on December 26, 2014 for “his courageous leadership in raising awareness of childhood sexual abuse and his continued efforts to prevent abuse in schools, sports and communities.”\n\nKennedy received the Lincoln Alexander Outstanding Leader Award at the University of Guelph, March 25, 2015.\n\nIn 2016 Kennedy was appointed to the Alberta Order of Excellence.\n\nA television movie about his life, \"The Sheldon Kennedy Story,\" aired on CTV in 1999. Jonathan Scarfe starred as Kennedy. In 2006, he released his autobiography, \"Why I Didn't Say Anything - The Sheldon Kennedy Story\".

{"id": "2076622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076622", "title": "United Democrats of Hong Kong", "text": "United Democrats of Hong Kong\n\nThe United Democrats of Hong Kong (; UDHK) was a short-lived political party in Hong Kong founded in 1990 as the united front of the liberal democracy forces in preparation of the 1991 first ever direct election for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. It self-proclaimed as the first political party in Hong Kong. The party won a landslide victory by sweeping 12 of the 18 directly elected seats in the 1991 LegCo elections which shook the political landscape of Hong Kong. In 1994 it was merged with another pro-democracy party Meeting Point to form the contemporary Democratic Party.\n\nThe main objectives of Democrats are to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, to better the welfare and quality of life of the people of Hong Kong; and to strengthen the position of Hong Kong as an industrial, commercial and international financial centre. In pursuit of these aims, the party strived\n\nThe United Democrats had a large labour component among its top leadership. 6 of its 30 Central Committee members, including Szeto Wah and Lau Chin-shek, were leaders of the major independent unions, namely the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union (PTU) and the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee (CIC) respectively. They are veterans of labour protests and community movements. Some other core members of the party were experienced in collective mobilisation and electoral campaigns, such as Tuen Mun's Ng Ming-yam and Sha Tin's Lau Kong-wah and Wong Hong-chung and Eastern District's Man Sai-cheong who brought their local networks into the party.\n\nThe United Democrats of Hong Kong was established on 23 April 1990 as a grand alliance of the pro-democracy activists. As early as 1988, the pro-democratic groups including the Meeting Point, the Hong Kong Affairs Society (HKAS) and the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL), the three major pro-democracy groups at the time had already formed the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government (JCPDG) for the 1988 direction election for the Legislative Council. Soon after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the pro-democracy camp decided to come together to resist the foreseeing pressure from Beijing after 1997. The preparatory committee was formed by individuals from the pro-democracy pressure groups and unions, such as Lau Chin-shek from the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee (HKCIC), Cheung Man-kwong and Szeto Wah from the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union (HKPTU) and Michael Ho from the Association of Hong Kong Nursing Staff (AHKNS). Frederick Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the ADPL later quit the preparatory committee as he said the stance of the United Democrats did not fit the pro-grassroots stance of the ADPL.\n\nOn 23 April 1990, the party was officially launched by some 220 activists and mostly service professionals from the ranks of social workers, teachers, university professors, independent union activists, church leaders, and lawyers. In July, it held the party's first general meeting. It soon opened six district branches and extended to nine after the 1991 Legislative Council election. It was headed by barrister Martin Lee, as well as Szeto Wah who remained the leader of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. As such, the party was labelled \"anti-Beijing\" as their support for the democratic movements in China.\n\nAfter the United Democrats gained a landslide victory in the Urban Council and Regional Council elections in 1991, it began to prepare for the first direct election in September. However the fight for the candidacy led to many members returning to their original organisations, such as Meeting Point's Li Wah-ming, Zachary Wong and Tik Chi-yuen. The United Democrats also failed to reach agreement with the ADPL in Kowloon West. At last, the United Democrats formed an electoral alliance with the Meeting Point. The party won a landslide victory, winning 12 of the 18 directly elected seats and two functional constituency seats due to the widespread of anti-Beijing sentiments after the Tiananmen crackdown and also the electoral system. On 17 September 1991, Martin Lee led a delegation of 14 Legislative Councillors-elect from the United Democrats to meet the Governor David Wilson, demanded the Governor to respect the wishes of the people expressed in the election and filled the LegCo appointed seats with liberal-minded people.\n\nIn 1992, United Democrat Ng Ming-yam died suddenly and left his seat in the Legislative Council vacant. Vice-Chairman Albert Ho was defeated by rural leader Tang Siu-tong in the by-election. In 1993, Lau Kong-wah, a Sha Tin District Board member and Regional Councillor who did not follow the instruction from the party authority and Sha Tin District Board chairman Choy Kan-pui resigned from the party citing the party being too radical and confrontational. The two later formed the Civil Force, a pro-Beijing community organisation.\n\nThe United Democrats supported Chris Patten, the last Governor's controversial reform proposal which largely broadened the franchise and heavily criticised by Beijing. The party remained open critic of the Beijing policies. After the reform proposal was passed, the Beijing government set up the 57-member Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the preparation works of the establishment of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and planning for an alternative body, the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) to the 1995 elected legislature under Patten's proposal. No members from the United Democrats was appointed as PWC member or Hong Kong Affairs Advisor.\n\nIn preparation for the District Board elections in September 1994, the Urban and Regional elections in March 1995 and the first fully elected LegCo elections in September 1995, the United Democrats merged with another liberal party Meeting Point in April 1994 to form the Democratic Party.\n\nNote: Each voter got two votes in the 1991 Election.\n"}

Though born in the Occitan city of Toulouse in France, he is of Spanish descent as his parents had fled from the Francoist State.\n\nIt is worth noting that Mengo was born with greatly diminished hearing. In fact, it was estimated by doctors that 70% of his hearing ability was missing. Despite this handicap, his mother gave him a keyboard as a plaything. It is now clear that this had an impact upon his future career. During his teenage years, corrective surgery for his ears helped him to regain his hearing ability. Music, however, was not Mengo's first career plan. Upon completing the baccalauréat, Mengo pursued chemistry and physics at university.\n\nMusic initially was a hobby to Mengo as his studies came first. During his university years, Mengo would play piano at a local bar during the evenings. Mengo had purchased an 8 Track recorder, and this would play heavily into his move into the music industry. With Mengo writing the music, and his brother-in-law producing lyrics a considerable inventory of music was created. It was good enough for Mengo to get his first record contract in 1988, shortly thereafter he released his first single, which was a hit on the French Top 50. His music quickly became popular, and by 1992 he was asked to write a song for French superstar Johnny Hallyday. In 1993, he wrote an entire album for German singer Ute Lemper. He performed the song \"Parler d'amour\" with Ute on this album.\n\nDespite his successes, he remains relatively unknown.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Technical standards for battery sizes and types are published by standards organizations such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Many popular sizes are still referred to by old standard or manufacturer designations, and some non-systematic designations have been included in current international standards due to wide use.\n\nThe complete nomenclature for a battery specifies size, chemistry, terminal arrangement, and special characteristics. The same physically interchangeable cell size or battery size may have widely different characteristics; physical interchangeability is not the sole factor in substituting a battery.\n\nThe current IEC standards for portable primary (non-rechargeable) batteries bear the 60086 number. The relevant US standards are the ANSI C18 series, which are developed by a committee of the US National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA).\n\nBoth standards have several parts that cover general principles, physical specifications, and safety. Designations by IEC and ANSI standards do not entirely agree, though harmonization is in progress. Also, manufacturers have their systems for identifying cell types, so cross-reference tables are useful to identify equivalent types from different manufacturers.\nLead-acid automotive starting, lighting and ignition batteries have been standardized according to IEC standard 60095 and in North America by standards published by BCI.\n\nEarliest telephones relied upon batteries stored within them. These quickly became known as \"No.6\" 1.5 Volt batteries - they were 6\" tall. Stronger versions became available that were larger, labeled as No.7 and No.8, again, nominally 7\" and 8\" tall. Earliest automobile spark plugs were driven from this type of battery. The batteries were placed in wooden boxes that could hold 4 to 12 of them. These were special 'ignitor' batteries, built to take rough service and were sold at all motor garages. No.6 batteries were in common use worldwide inside hand-crank telephones up into the 1970-80's\n\nManufacturers may assign proprietary names and numbers to their batteries, disregarding common, colloquial, IEC, and ANSI naming conventions (see LR44 battery as an example). Often this is done to steer customers towards a specific brand, and away from competing or generic brands, by obfuscating the common name. For example, if a remote control needs a new battery and the battery compartment has the label, \"Replace with CX472 type battery,\" many customers will buy that specific brand, not realizing that this is simply a brand name for a common type of battery. For example, British standard \"U\" series batteries were often sold under manufacturer prefixes such as \"C\", \"SP\", \"HP\", etc.; Ever Ready sold \"U2\" (D) batteries as \"SP2\" (standard-duty zinc carbon) and \"HP2\" (heavy duty zinc chloride).\n\nOn the other hand, with obscure battery types, the designation assigned by a specific brand will sometimes become the most common name for that battery type, as other manufacturers copy or modify the name so that customers recognize it.\n\nThe terminal voltage of a battery cell depends on the chemicals and materials used in its construction, and not on its physical size. For example, primary (non-rechargeable) alkaline batteries have a nominal voltage of 1.5 volts. Rechargeable NiCd (nickel cadmium) and NiMH (nickel metal hydride) typically output 1.25 volts per cell. Devices intended for use with primary batteries may not operate properly with these cells, given the reduction in voltage.\n\nDry Leclanché (carbon-zinc), alkaline and Lithium batteries are the most common modern types. Mercury batteries had stable cell terminal voltages around 1.35 volts. From the late 1940s until the mid-1990s, mercury batteries were made in many consumer and industrial sizes. They are no longer available since careless disposal can release toxic mercury into the environment. They have been replaced in some applications by zinc-air batteries, which also produce 1.35 volts.\n\nThe full battery designation identifies not only the size, shape and terminal layout of the battery but also the chemistry (and therefore the voltage per cell) and the number of cells in the battery. For example, a CR123 battery is always LiMnO ('Lithium') chemistry, in addition to its unique size.\n\nThe following tables give the common battery chemistry types for the current common sizes of batteries. See Battery chemistry for a list of other electrochemical systems.\n\nCylindrical cells typically have a positive terminal nub at one end, and a flat negative terminal at the other. A cell with a nub on the positive terminal is called a button-top, and a cell without a positive nub is called a flat-top. Two different cells of the same nominal size, e.g. two 18650 cells, may have different diameter buttons if made by different manufacturers, and this can lead to incompatibility with devices. Flat-top cells cannot be used in series without modification or soldering into position, because the flat positive terminal of one cell cannot contact with the next cell's negative terminal. Rarely, however, a manufacturer may include tiny bumps on the \"negative\" terminal, so flat-tops can be used in series.\n\nThese are round batteries with height longer than their diameter. In zinc-carbon or alkaline types they produce around 1.5 V per cell when fresh. Other types produce other voltages per package, as low as 1.2 V for rechargeable nickel-cadmium, up to 12 V for the A23 alkaline battery, a stack of 8 cells in the same overall format. This package has a positive nub terminal at the cap of the cell, and the negative terminal at the bottom of the can; the side of the can is not used as a terminal. The polarity of the can side may even change, according to their chemistry and whether the can is sealed from the positive or negative end. The internal cell construction may differ, common types are named \"bobbin\", \"spiral\" and \"coiled\".\n\nAs well as other types, digital and film cameras often use specialized primary batteries to produce a compact product. Flashlights and portable electronic devices may also use these types.\n\nCoin-shaped cells are thin compared to their diameter. Polarity is usually stamped on the metal casing.\n\nThe IEC prefix \"CR\" denotes lithium manganese dioxide chemistry. Since LiMnO cells produce 3 volts there are no widely available alternative chemistries for a lithium coin battery. The \"BR\" prefix indicates a round lithium/carbon monofluoride cell. See lithium battery for discussion of the different performance characteristics. One LiMnO cell can replace two alkaline or silver-oxide cells.\n\nIEC designation numbers indicate the physical dimensions of the cylindrical cell. Cells less than one centimeter in height are assigned four-digit numbers, where the first two digits are the diameter in millimeters, while the last two digits are the height in tenths of millimeters. Taller cells are assigned five-digit numbers, where the first two digits are the diameter in millimeters, followed by the last three digits indicating the height in tenths of millimeters.\n\nAll these lithium cells are rated nominally 3 volts (on-load), with open circuit voltage about 3.6 volts. Manufacturers may have their own part numbers for IEC standard size cells. The capacity listed is for a constant resistance discharge down to 2.0 volts per cell.\n\nRound button cells have heights less than their diameter. The metal can is the positive terminal, and the cap is the negative terminal.\n\nButton cells are commonly used in electric watches, clocks, and timers. IEC batteries that meet the international IEC 60086-3 standard for watch batteries carry a \"W\" suffix. Other uses include calculators, laser pointers, toys, LED \"blinkies\", and novelties.\n\nIEC designation numbers indicate the physical dimensions of the cylindrical cell. Cells less than one centimeter in height are assigned 4-digit numbers, where the first 2 digits are the diameter in millimeters, while the last 2 digits are the height in tenths of millimeters. Taller cells are assigned 5-digit numbers, where the first 2 digits are the diameter in millimeters, followed by the last 3 digits indicating the height in tenths of millimeters.\n\nIn the IEC designations, cell types with an \"SR\" prefix use silver oxide chemistry and provide 1.55 volts, while the \"LR\" prefix batteries use alkaline chemistry and provide 1.5 volts. Common alternative manufacturer's prefixes for these two types are \"SG\" for silver oxide and \"AG\" for alkaline. Since there are no \"common\" names beyond the AG designation, many vendors use these four designations interchangeably for the same physical sized cell.\n\nThe functional differences are that silver oxide batteries typically have 50% greater capacity than alkaline chemistry, relatively slowly declining voltage during discharge compared to alkaline types of the same size, and superior leakage resistance. The ultimate energy capacity of a silver battery may be as much as twice that of an alkaline. Also, a silver cell with a flat discharge characteristic is preferable for devices that need a steady voltage, such as photographic light meters, and devices that will not operate below a certain voltage; for example, some digital calipers, which do not work below 1.38V.\n\nAlkaline batteries are usually cheaper than silver oxide equivalents. Inexpensive devices are sometimes supplied fitted with alkaline batteries, though they would benefit from the use of silver oxide batteries. Exhausted silver oxide cells are often recycled to recover their precious metal content, whereas depleted alkaline cells are discarded with household trash or recycled, depending on the local practices.\n\nMercury batteries were formerly commonly made in button sizes for watches, but due to careless disposal and the resulting mercury pollution hazard, they are no longer available. This is also a concern for users of vintage camera equipment, which typically used a mercury button battery in the exposure meter for its very steady voltage characteristic. Substitute non-mercury batteries have been produced to replace certain discontinued mercury batteries, typically by incorporating a miniature voltage regulator to simulate the flat voltage discharge characteristics of the original batteries.\n\nIn the following table, sizes are shown for the silver-oxide IEC number; types and capacity are identified as \"(L)\" for alkaline, \"(M)\" for mercury (no longer manufactured), and \"(S)\" for silver-oxide. Some sizes may be interchangeably used in battery holders. For example, the 189/389 cell is 3.1 mm high and was designated 1131, while the 190/390 size is 3.0 mm high and was designated 1130, but a battery holder will accept either size.\n\nMiniature zinc-air batteries are button cells that use oxygen in air as a reactant and have very high capacity for their size. Each cell needs around 1 cc of air per minute at a 10 mA discharge rate. These cells are commonly used in hearing aids. A sealing tab keeps air out of the cell in storage; a few weeks after breaking the seal the electrolyte will dry out and the battery becomes unusable, regardless of use. Nominal voltage on discharge is 1.2 V.\n\nLithium-ion rechargeable batteries are generally not interchangeable with primary types using different chemistry, though certain lithium primary cell sizes do have lithium-ion rechargeable equivalents. Most rechargeable cylindrical cells use a chemistry with a nominal voltage around 3.7 volts, but cells produce only 3.2 volts.\n\nLithium-ion cells are made in various sizes, often assembled into packs for portable equipment. Many types are also available with an internal protection circuit to prevent over-discharge and short-circuit damage. This can increase their physical length; for example, an 18650 is around long, but may be around long with an internal protection circuit. Safe and economic recharging requires a charger specified for these cells. Popular applications include laptop battery packs, electronic cigarettes, flashlights, electric vehicles, and cordless power tools.\n\nCommonly-used designation numbers indicate the physical dimensions of the cylindrical cell, in a way similar to the system used for lithium button primary cells. The larger rechargeable cells are typically assigned five-digit numbers, where the first two digits are the (approximate) diameter in millimeters, followed by the last three digits indicating the (approximate) height in tenths of millimeters.\nThese types are associated with legacy applications or no longer manufactured.\n\nThe PP (\"Power Pack\") series was manufactured by Ever Ready in the UK (Eveready in the US). The series comprised multi-cell carbon-zinc batteries used for portable electronic devices. Most sizes are uncommon today; however, the PP3 size (and to a lesser extent PP8 and PP9, which are used in electric fencing and marine applications respectively) is readily available. The PP4 was cylindrical; all the other types were rectangular. Most had snap terminals as seen on the common PP3 type. These came in two incompatible sizes, as is evident in some of the pictures below, those on larger, mostly older, battery types such as the PP9 being somewhat larger than those on the smaller batteries such as the PP3.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2076646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076646", "title": "Simultaneous communication", "text": "Simultaneous communication\n\nSimultaneous communication, SimCom, or sign supported speech (SSS) is a technique sometimes used by deaf, hard-of-hearing or hearing sign language users in which both a spoken language and a manual variant of that language (such as English and manually coded English) are used simultaneously. While the idea of communicating using two modes of language seems ideal in a hearing/deaf setting, in practice the two languages are rarely relayed perfectly. Often the native language of the user (usually spoken language for the hearing person and sign language for the deaf person) is the language that is strongest, while the non-native language degrades in clarity. In an educational environment this is particularly difficult for deaf children as a majority of teachers who teach the deaf are hearing. Results from surveys taken indicate that communication for students is indeed signing (about 2/3 of the population of students), and that the signing leans more toward English rather than ASL.\n\nManual communication, including simultaneous communication, has existed for a while in the United States, but gained traction in the 70's. The history of using signing with children has been a tumultuous one, with many swings between discouraging the use of signed languages and focusing on oralism, to the current push of bilingualism in Deaf schools. Ultimately, the majority of schools pushed the signed language they used to focus on English, resulting in the birth of a language that combined spoken language (English) with a manual language. The historical use of SC in schools has been stormy, with professionals (both researchers and teachers alike) on either side of the debate on whether the language is useful or not.\n\nAccording to a study done in 1984, it was found that compared with haphazard instruction involving no language approach whatsoever, Total Communication was proved to be beneficial when combined with the correct approach.\n\nOne study entitled \"Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication\", 12 hearing impaired individuals were asked to audit the audio samples of 4 hearing sign language experts who had produced recordings of a Simultaneous Communication (SC) sample and a Speech Alone (SA) sample. The 12 hearing impaired individuals were asked to then determine which speech produced was clearer. After listening to both audio samples, hearing impaired listeners agreed that both SC and SA were intelligible, which is supported by previous research. Since the intelligibility of the speech was kept on par with English grammar, the study results indicate that SC is a positive tool to use with Deaf and Hard of Hearing children as a language model and for Deaf/Hard of Hearing adults to keep using.\n\nAnother study showed the difference between a control group, families who participated in an intervention program that offered services such as classes on Total Communication, private teachers for the child and a deaf adult who came to the families house, and another group of families who used TC, but did not have as much intervention as the control group. The results showed that intervention did work, and that it positively correlated with the communication skills show by the control group's children. The children showed advanced cognitive skills, including comprehension and expression, specifically related to time.\n\nA study done in 1990 titled \"The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom\" by Dennis Cokely reviewed research done previously that supported the use of Total Communication (SimCom) in the classroom. However, the study pointed out several restrictive factors that several research tests had not approached. One of the tests administered only compared SimCom, the Rochester Method and speech reading with voice (lip reading), omitting the option of ASL as a means of communication. The 1990 study addressed this issue by comparing SimCom, Sign Alone and Interpretation to see which was the most effective. The results from the comparison showed that signing alone as a way for students to understand information given was the most effective and SimCom was the least effective. Overall, Sign Alone and Interpretation was most effective in all areas of the test, proving that SimCom was a struggle for teachers and students alike. When working with two separate modes of communication, the one that comes naturally for the user will be the more prominent mode. A study conducted in 1998 showed that signing and speaking at the same time results in a slower approach to instruction than if just one modality was used to express language.\n\nListed below are the signed communications that are used within SimCom. Since SimCom can use any spoken language, mainly English, combined with any signed mode, all communication listed below are available for use. \n\n"}

Her family was Jewish. She was only 6 years old when her mother took her to Educational Pictures, where she became the company's trademark, symbolized by a living statue holding a lamp of knowledge. In her autobiography, \"I'll Cry Tomorrow\" (1954), she describes being molested by the man who painted her as a statue. She attended the Professional Children’s School in New York, with classmates Ruby Keeler and Milton Berle.\n\nIn 1917 Roth made her Broadway debut as the character \"Flossie\" in \"The Inner Man\". Her film debut occurred the following year, when she performed as an extra in the government documentary \"Pershing's Crusaders\". She and her sister Ann also toured together during this period as \"Lillian Roth and Co.\", although at times they were billed as \"The Roth Kids\". According to Lillian's autobiography, one of the highlights of their tour was meeting U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who attended the girls' vaudeville act and afterwards allowed them to ride with him briefly in his chauffeur-driven car.\n\nRoth entered the Clark School of Concentration in the early 1920s. She appeared in \"Artists and Models\" in 1923 and went on to make \"Revels\" with Frank Fay. During production for the show, she told management she was 19 years of age despite being only 13 at the time.\n\nIn 1927, at the age of 17, Roth returned to Broadway to perform in the first of three \"Earl Carroll Vanities\", which was followed by \"Midnight Frolics\", a Florenz Ziegfeld production. Soon the young actress signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures.\n\nAmong the films she made with Paramount are \"The Love Parade\" (1929) with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, \"The Vagabond King\" (1930), \"Paramount on Parade\" (1930), \"Honey\" (1930; in which she introduced \"Sing, You Sinners\"), Cecil B. DeMille's \"Madam Satan\" (1930) with Reginald Denny and Kay Johnson, \"Sea Legs\" with Jack Oakie, and the Marx Brothers' second film, \"Animal Crackers\" (1930). She took over Ethel Merman's stage role in the film version of \"Take a Chance\", singing \"Eadie Was a Lady\". After leaving Paramount, she was cast by Warner Bros. in a supporting role in the 1933 women's prison film \"Ladies They Talk About\" starring Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nRoth headlined the Palace Theatre in New York City and performed in the \"Earl Carroll Vanities\" in 1928, 1931, and 1932. She continued to make strides as a singer in an era when so much was being set to music.\n\nRoth was out of the limelight from the late 1930s. Roth's personal and spiritual feelings led her to convert to Catholicism in 1948. Friends accused her of forsaking Judaism; however, in her autobiography Roth explains that although her parents had believed in God, her sister and she had not been brought up religiously. Roth in her book also insists that she was so inherently Jewish that she could not really forget her heritage and thought that she was \"the richer\" because of it. In February 1953, she appeared on a special episode of the TV series \"This Is Your Life\" hosted by Ralph Edwards. In response to her honesty in relating her story of alcoholism, she received more than 40,000 letters. Her theme song, which she began singing as a child performer, was \"When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)\".\n\nIn 1962, she was featured as Elliott Gould's mother in the Broadway musical \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\", in which Barbra Streisand made her Broadway debut. Despite the acclaim for Streisand, producer David Merrick realized that Roth's name still sold tickets, and he elevated her to above-title star billing after the show's opening, with Gould, Streisand, and Sheree North listed below. Roth remained with the show for its full run of 301 performances and recorded the cast album for Columbia Records.\n\nShe was also featured as Mrs. Brice in the national touring company of \"Funny Girl\" in 1964, again getting top billing.\n\nRoth was married six times: to Mark Harris, to aviator William C. Scott (\"Willie Richards\"), Judge Benjamin Shalleck, Eugene J. Weiner, Edward Goldman (\"Vic\"), and Thomas Burt McGuire. Before her marriages, she was engaged to David Lyons, who died of tuberculosis. She divorced her second husband in 1932 after 13 months of marriage.\n\nIn 1947, she met her last husband, Thomas Burt McGuire, scion of Funk and Wagnalls Publishing Company at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting (Roth joined Alcoholics Anonymous in 1946). The two wed and McGuire managed Roth until September 1963 when she received a note from him stating that their marriage was finished.\n\nRoth returned to Broadway in 1971 in the Kander and Ebb musical \"70, Girls, 70\", which despite its short run was also recorded by Columbia Records and has remained a popular cast album. She played a pathologist in the 1976 cult horror classic \"Alice, Sweet Alice\" (also known as \"Communion\"). Her last film was \"Boardwalk\", with Lee Strasberg, Ruth Gordon, and Janet Leigh (1979). A successful concert at Town Hall was released as an album by AEI Records after her death. One of her latter appearances was in a well-reviewed club act at the legendary NYC nightclub, Reno Sweeney. \n\nRoth's autobiography, \"I'll Cry Tomorrow\", was written with author-collaborator Gerold Frank in 1954, and a toned-down version of it was made into a hit film the following year starring Susan Hayward, who was nominated for an Academy Award. The book became a bestseller worldwide and sold more than 7 million copies in 20 languages, and the film renewed the public's interest in Roth. She recorded four songs for the Coral label (the first commercial recordings of her career), which were followed by an LP for Epic and another for Tops. She also headlined a vaudeville revival at the Palace on Broadway. A highlight of her act was an imitation of Susan Hayward imitating her (Roth) singing \"Red, Red Robin\".\n\nIn 1958, Roth published a second book, \"Beyond My Worth\", which was not as successful as its predecessor, but told the compelling story of what it was like to be placed on a pedestal that she could not always live up to. Roth had managed to re-invent herself as a major concert and nightclub performer. She appeared at venues in Las Vegas and New York's Copacabana and was a popular attraction in Australia.\n\nAfter suffering a stroke at her New York City apartment in February 1980, Roth died at age 69 on May 12 at De Witt Nursing Home in Manhattan. Her obituary in \"The New York Times\" reports that she had \"no immediate survivors\". Roth's grave marker in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Westchester County, New York includes the inscription \"As bad as it was it was good\".\n\nShort Subjects:\n\nFeatures:\n\n"}

There are many causes of leukorrhea, the usual one being estrogen imbalance. The amount of discharge may increase due to vaginal infection, and it may disappear and reappear from time to time. This discharge can keep occurring for years, in which case it becomes more yellow and foul-smelling. It is usually a non-pathological symptom secondary to inflammatory conditions of the vagina or cervix.\n\nLeukorrhea can be confirmed by finding >10 WBC under a microscope when examining vaginal fluid.\n\nVaginal discharge is normal, and causes of change in discharge include infection, malignancy, and hormonal changes. It sometimes occurs before a girl has her first period, and is considered a sign of puberty.\n\nIt is not a major issue but is to be resolved as soon as possible. It can be a natural defense mechanism that the vagina uses to maintain its chemical balance, as well as to preserve the flexibility of the vaginal tissue. The term \"physiologic leukorrhea\" is used to refer to leukorrhea due to estrogen stimulation.\n\nLeukorrhea may occur normally during pregnancy. This is caused by increased bloodflow to the vagina due to increased estrogen. Female infants may have leukorrhea for a short time after birth due to their in-uterine exposure to estrogen.\n\nIt may also result from inflammation or congestion of the vaginal mucosa. In cases where it is yellowish or gives off an odor, a doctor should be consulted since it could be a sign of several disease processes, including an organic bacterial infection (aerobic vaginitis) or STD.\n\nAfter delivery, leukorrhea accompanied by backache and foul-smelling lochia (post-partum vaginal discharge, containing blood, mucus, and placental tissue) may suggest the failure of involution (the uterus returning to pre-pregnancy size) due to infection. A number of investigation such as wet smear, Gram stain, culture, pap smear and biopsy are suggested to diagnose the condition.\n\nLeukorrhea is also caused by trichomonads, a group of parasitic protozoan, specifically \"Trichomonas vaginalis\". Common symptoms of this disease are burning sensation, itching and discharge of frothy substance, thick, white or yellow mucous.\n\nLeukorrhea may be caused by sexually transmitted diseases; therefore, treating the STD will help treat the leukorrhea.\n\nTreatment may include antibiotics, such as metronidazole. Other antibiotics common for the treatment of STDs include clindamycin or tinidazole.\n\nThe word leukorrhea comes from Greek λευκός (leukós, “white”) + ῥοία (rhoía, “flow, flux”).

By then it had about of double track (103.2 route km or 64.12 route miles) and 1,200 cars and trailers, on 15 routes radiating from the centre of Melbourne to neighbouring suburbs. It was one of the largest cable car systems in the world, comparable with those of San Francisco which had 23 lines, and Chicago which had 66.0 km of double track.\n\nWith the exception of the Northcote tramway, which was privately built and managed, the infrastructure of the network was built by the Melbourne Tramway Trust, which consisted of representatives of the 12 local councils served by the system. The trust bought land, laid the tracks, and built the cable winding houses. The Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company (MTOC) provided the trams and operated the services from 1885 to 1916 under an exclusive 30-year franchise arrangement with the Victorian Government. MTOC had been founded by Francis Boardman Clapp, an American emigrant, who had purchased the Victorian rights to the patents of the cable system developed by Andrew Hallidie. George Smith Duncan, who had built the Roslyn cable tramway in Dunedin, New Zealand, was the engineer in charge of the development of the Melbourne cable network.\n\nOn the expiration of the MTOC's franchise in 1916, the cable tram network was transferred to the Victorian Government, and then passed to the government-owned Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) on 1 November 1919. The Northcote tramway was transferred to the MMTB on 20 February 1920.\n\nAlthough the first electric tram service was introduced in 1889, and ran for seven years between the outer Melbourne suburbs of Box Hill and Doncaster, the electric tram network did not seriously commence until 1906, when the Victorian Railways built an \"Electric Street Railway\" from St Kilda railway station to Brighton, and The North Melbourne Electric Tramway & Lighting Company built an electric tramway towards Essendon from the terminus of the cable system. From 1924 the cable tram lines were progressively converted to electric traction. The last Melbourne cable tram ran on 26 October 1940, on the Northcote to Bourke Street route.\n\nThe Richmond line opened on 11 November 1885, and ran between Hawthorn Bridge and City (Spencer Street). The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The line was at first truncated to Swanston Street on 15 May 1927, the rest of the line closing on 29 June 1927. The converted line between Swanston Street and Spencer Street opened on 14 July 1927. The section between Swanston Street and Simpson Street opened on 17 September 1927, and the rest of the line to Hawthorn Bridge opened later that year on 4 December, connecting with the Church Street line and the Burwood Road line, which were already in operation. This conversion enabled Mont Albert and East Kew trams to reach the city directly. The powerhouse was located on Bridge Road, at Hoddle Street, and has since been demolished to provide for a left-turn lane. The remains of the Richmond cable tram depot now form part of the Amora Hotel, near Hawthorn Bridge.\n\nThe North Fitzroy line opened on 2 October 1886, and ran between North Fitzroy and City (Collins Street). The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The North Fitzroy Line was truncated to Brunswick Street on 14 September 1929. The line was eventually fully closed on 12 July 1930. The Collins Street section was converted to electric traction and opened on 8 December 1929. The line between Brunswick Street and North Fitzroy was reopened on 26 October 1930. This conversion enabled a direct route for West Preston and East Preston electric trams to reach the city, rather than using the Holden Street line. The powerhouse was located on the north-east corner of Victoria Parade and Brunswick Street. The car shed was located at Holden Street near the North Fitzroy terminus.\nThe Victoria Bridge line opened on 22 November 1886, and ran between Victoria Bridge and City (Collins Street). The Victoria Bridge line was closed on 13 July 1929 for conversion to electric traction between Victoria Bridge and Brunswick Street. This section reopened on 15 September 1929, providing a second route for East Kew and Mont Albert electric trams to reach the city (along with Bridge Road). The rest of the Collins Street line was converted to electric traction and reopened on 8 December 1929. The powerhouse was located on the north-east corner of Victoria Parade and Brunswick Street. The car shed was located on Victoria Street near the Victoria Bridge terminus.\n\nThe Clifton Hill line opened on 10 August 1887, and ran between Clifton Hill and City (Bourke Street). When the Clifton Hill - Northcote line opened in 1890, it interchanged with the Clifton Hill line at its southern terminus. Passengers initially had to physically walk between the two lines for a through service. When the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board took over the line in 1925, the two lines were connected together and a through-service was established between Northcote and the City (Bourke Street). The combined Clifton Hill/Northcote line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Nicholson Street line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses. Within a few years, it was noticed that the bus route were unsuccessful at coping with the high demand of the routes, so conversion of the Northcote line to electric traction was scheduled to take place right after World War II ended. However, it was not until 26 September 1955 that the Northcote/Clifton Hill route finally reopened. The powerhouse was located on the south-east corner of Nicholson and Gertrude Streets. The car shed was located on Queens Parade near the Clifton Hill terminus.\n\nThe Nicholson Street line opened on 30 August 1887, and ran between Nicholson Street and City (Bourke Street). The Nicholson Street line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Northcote line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses. Within a few years, it was noticed that the bus route were unsuccessful at coping with the high demand of the routes, so conversion of the Northcote line to electric traction was scheduled to take place right after World War II ended. However, it wasn't until 8 April 1956 that the Nicholson Street route finally reopened. The powerhouse located on the south-east corner of Nicholson and Gertrude Streets. The car shed was located on Nicholson Street near the Nicholson Street terminus.\n\nThe Brunswick line opened on 1 October 1887, and ran between Brunswick and City (Elizabeth Street). The Brunswick line was converted to electric traction in stages. The line was first truncated to Victoria Street on 29 September 1935. It was further truncated to Leonard Street, Parkville on 17 November 1935. The Brunswick Line was finally closed on 11 January 1936. The powerhouse was located on the north-west corner of Brunswick Road and Black Street. The car shed was located near the Moreland Road terminus.\n\nThe Collingwood line opened on 21 December 1887, and initially ran between Collingwood and City (Lonsdale Street). When the Prahran line opened in 1888, the Collingwood line operated through-routed services to Prahran. When the Swanston Street line was truncated back to Princes Bridge on 26 December 1925 for electrification, the Collingwood and North Carlton lines were truncated back to Lonsdale Street. The line was finally closed on 15 April 1939, being converted into a bus service. The powerhouse was located on the north side of Johnston Street, near Brunswick Street. The car shed was located near the Johnston Street Bridge terminus.\n\nThe Brighton Road line opened on 11 October 1888, and originally ran between Brighton Road and City (Swanston Street). The initial city terminus was at Flinders Street, but this was extended northwards towards Queensberry Street on 20 January 1889. The trams operated along Brighton Road, High Street (now just St Kilda Road), St Kilda Road and Swanston Street from Brunning Street, Balaclava to Queensberry Street, Carlton. The line was truncated from Queensberry Street to Lonsdale Street on 11 February 1924 to allow the electric trams from the North to terminate in the City. Following this point, Brighton Road trams were through-routed to North Melbourne via Lonsdale Street. The Brighton Road tram line fully closed for electrification on 26 December 1925, but the section between City Road and Domain Road remained for Toorak and Prahran trams to use. An electrified line from Lonsdale Street to Brighton Road was completed on 29 August 1926. Both the powerhouse and car shed were located on the south-east corner of St Kilda Road and Bromby Street.\n\nThe Prahran line opened on 26 October 1888, and ran between Prahran and City (Swanston Street). All Prahran line trams were through-routed to Collingwood via Lonsdale Street. The line ran along Chapel Street from Carlisle Street and Toorak Road where it met the Toorak line, along Toorak Road, Park Street and Domain Road to St Kilda Road where it met the Brighton Road line. Trams then ran via St Kilda Road and Swanston Street to Lonsdale Street where trams continued onto Collingwood. The line was truncated to City Road on 26 December 1925, when the Swanston Street line was closed for electrification. The line was further truncated back to Domain Road on 12 January 1926, when the St Kilda Road line was being converted to electric traction. The rest of the line was closed on 28 August 1926. However, Toorak trams still used the line between Domain Road and Chapel Street until October 1 later that year. The powerhouse and the car shed were both located on the north-west corner of Toorak Road and Chapel Street.\n\nThe North Carlton line opened on 9 February 1889, and ran between North Carlton and City (Lonsdale Street). In 1897, the North Carlton service began running through-routed services to St Kilda Beach. The line was closed in 1 August 1936, being replaced by a bus service, though the Collingwood line continued to use the section of track between Rathdowne Street and Lonsdale Street until it closed on 15 April 1939. Both the powerhouse and the car shed were located at the south-west corner of Rathdowne and Park Streets.\n\nThe Toorak line opened on 15 February 1889, and ran between Toorak and City (Swanston Street). The initial city terminus was at Flinders Street, but this was extended northwards towards Queensberry Street on 20 January 1889. The line was truncated from Queensberry Street to Lonsdale Street on 11 February 1924 to allow the electric trams from the North to terminate in the City. The line was truncated to City Road on 26 December 1925, when the Swanston Street line was closed for electrification. The line was further truncated back to Domain Road on 12 January 1926, when the St Kilda Road line was being converted to electric traction. The rest of the line was finally closed on 1 October 1926. Both the car shed and the powerhouse located on the north-west corner of Toorak Road and Chapel Street.\n\nThe North Melbourne Line opened on 3 March 1890, and ran between Flemington Bridge and City (Elizabeth Street). Trams initially terminated at Flinders Street, but due to congestion, the line was diverted at Lonsdale Street and through-routed to Brighton Road on 11 February 1924. The section between Flemington Bridge and Abbotsford Street was closed for electric conversion on 18 July 1925, which was first section cable line in Melbourne to close. The rest of the line closed for conversion to electric traction on 20 July 1935, though the Brunswick Line continued to use the Elizabeth Street section until 28 September 1935. The powerhouse was located on the west corner of Queensberry and Abbotsford Streets. The car shed was located was located near the Flemington Bridge terminus, but later was moved to Victoria Street, near the intersection of Howard Street after the Flemington Bridge section of the line was closed.\n\nThe West Melbourne line opened on 18 April 1890, and ran between West Melbourne and City (Elizabeth Street). The entire line was closed on 20 July 1935, being replaced by buses, though the Elizabeth Street section of the line was used by the Brunswick Line for a few months after until it too closed on 28 September 1935. The powerhouse was located at the south-west corner of Queensberry Street and Abbotsford Street. The car shed for the West Melbourne line was always shared with the North Melbourne line, first using the Flemington Bridge car shed and later using the Victoria Street car shed from 18 July 1925 onwards.\n\nThe South Melbourne opened on 17 June 1890, and ran between South Melbourne and City (Collins Street). Initially, the city terminus was located on Gisborne Street at Victoria Parade, but after the Collins Street line was closed for electrification on 14 September 1929, the South Melbourne line was truncated back to Market Street. Eventually, the line entire line closed for electrification on 13 July 1937, but the electric line instead ran to the city via Spencer Street, the City Road section being abandoned. The powerhouse was located on the south side of City Road, near Cecil Street. The car shed was located near the South Melbourne terminus on Victoria Avenue.\n\nThe Port Melbourne line opened on 20 June 1890, and ran between Port Melbourne and City (Collins Street). Initially, the city terminus was located on Gisborne Street at Victoria Parade, but after the Collins Street line was closed for electrification on 14 September 1929, the Port Melbourne line was truncated back to Market Street. Eventually, the line entire line closed on 13 July 1937, being replaced by a bus service. The powerhouse located on the south side of City Road, near Cecil Street. The car shed was located on Beaconsfield Parade near the Port Melbourne terminus.\n\nThe Windsor - St Kilda line opened on 17 October 1891, and ran between Windsor Railway Station and St Kilda Beach. It was the final cable tram line to open, but was also the first major line to close for electrification on 29 August 1925. The powerhouse was located on the north side of Wellington Street, near Marlton Crescent. The car shed was located near the St Kilda terminus on Acland Street.\n\nThe Clifton Hill - Northcote line was opened by the Clifton Hill to Northcote & Preston Tramway Company on 18 February 1890, and was Melbourne's only privately built and operated cable tramway. It ran between the northern terminus of the Clifton Hill line, and Dundas Street, Northcote. Early in its existence, the line struggled financially. Passengers initially had to physically walk to the Clifton Hill line for a through service to the city. When the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board took over the line in 1925, the two lines were connected together and a through-service was established between Northcote and the City (Bourke Street). The combined Clifton Hill/Northcote line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Nicholson Street line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses. Within a few years, it was noticed that the bus route were unsuccessful at coping with the high demand of the routes, so conversion of the Northcote line to electric traction was scheduled to take place right after World War II ended. However, it wasn't until 26 September 1955 that the Northcote/Clifton Hill route finally reopened. The powerhouse and the car shed was located on the north-east corner of High and Martin Streets.\n\n\nThe Melbourne Cable Trams Matthews, H.H.

It entered service in 1970. The rifle was replaced by the Accuracy International PM as the L96A1 in 1985. \n\nThe L42A1 was the last model in a long line of bolt-action rifles that used a rear-locking action designed by James Paris Lee for the British Army; this action design appeared first in the Lee–Metford rifle of 1888. During its British Army service, the L42A1 was used in active service in several conflicts, including the Dhofar Rebellion in Oman, The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Falklands War, and the Gulf War.\n\nThe L42A1 was a 7.62×51mm NATO conversion of the Second World War era .303 British chambered Lee–Enfield Rifle No. 4 Mk1(T) and No. 4 Mk1*(T), which had remained in service for some time after the 7.62×51mm NATO L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle replaced the Rifle No.4 as the standard service rifle in 1957. It differed from other post-war No. 4 based variants in that the trigger remained hinged on the trigger guard as on the No.4 Mk1 and 1*, not hung from the receiver as in the later No. 4 Mk 2, Mk 1/2 and Mk 1/3 .303 British rifles, and other 7.62×51mm NATO conversions. \n\nThe conversion programme was carried out at Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield from 1970 to 1971. About 1,080 rifles were converted. A new hammer-forged heavy 7.62×51mm NATO barrel was installed, with four-groove, right hand twist rifling instead of the five-groove left-hand Enfield-type rifling used in .303 British barrels. The heavier barrel was free-floating, which meant that the required accuracy standard could be achieved without the barrel bearing against the wooden fore-end, as had been the case with the No.4 MkI(T). Therefore the woodwork was modified by shortening the fore-end to 1/2\" in front of the middle band, and a new design for an upper handguard was fitted. \n\nThe No. 32 3.5 power telescopic sight was refurbished and the bullet drop compensation on the elevation drum modified for the ballistic characteristics of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge in increments out to . The modified version was renamed the \"Telescope, Straight Sighting, L1A1\". \n\nA new magazine suitable for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge was attached; it is recognizable by its more square shape when compared against the .303 British version. A hardened projection of the left magazine lip serves as an ejector, although the .303 ejector screw remained in place. The butt with its screwed-on cheekpiece was retained, however the scope number on the wrist of the stock, was obliterated with \"X\"-outs, and new numbers applied. The markings on the left side of the receiver were obliterated and new markings reflecting the new rifle's designation and chambering were applied. The original markings are sometimes partially visible underneath. \n\nA new, larger transit case was made for the L42A1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Both procedures are often combined, but can be performed separately.\n\n\"Chopping the top\" goes back to the early days of hot rodding and is an attempt to reduce the frontal profile of a car and increase its speed potential. To chop a roof, the pillars and windows are cut down, lowering the overall roofline. Some racers on the dry lakes chopped the tops of their cars so severely the windows were only a few inches tall. These were sometimes referred to as \"mail slot\" windows. This sort of bodywork is also popular on custom cars, kustoms, and leadsleds. Roof chopping also quickly became very popular with drag racers for much the same reasons as it did for lakes racers. The first roof chopper is considered to be Sam Barris (brother of auto customizer George Barris), who chopped and customized his brand new 1949 Mercury. Barris also pioneered a more advanced form, where the B-pillar is removed, turning it into a pillarless hardtop in the process.\n\nConcept cars, such as the AMX-GT, often undergo a lowering of their roofs, even if the vehicles are based on production models. Automakers use the chopping technique to make their show cars look more sleek and \"racy\", although it would be impractical for normal use.\n\n\"Channeling\" is a modification that can be applied to cars with body-on-frame construction. To channel a car, its body is temporarily lifted off of its ladder or perimeter frame. After cutting the floor loose and refastening it higher inside the body, the body can then be lowered back over the frame. Thus the modification causes the entire body to rest closer to the ground without alterations to the suspension. The overall effect is to give the car's body a more massive appearance.\nEach automobile would have its own engineering challenges as far as modifying the various components of the chassis. Local laws may prevent making the modifications too extreme, and safety would dictate some restraint. Channeling is also popular amongst hot rod, leadsled and minitruck enthusiasts, though the latter refer to it as a \"body drop\".\n\nSectioning removes a horizontal section from the body of a car, lowering the top half onto the bottom half, and welding the result back together. The purpose is to reduce the overall height of the bodywork of the car. Like a roof chop, it also has the advantage of reducing a car's frontal area and reducing wind resistance. This sort of bodywork is popular on minitrucks, race cars, kustoms, and leadsleds.\n\n"}
{"id": "2076702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076702", "title": "George Boxley", "text": "George Boxley\n\nGeorge Boxley (1780–1865) was a white abolitionist and former slaveholder who allegedly tried to coordinate a local slave rebellion on March 6, 1815, while living in Spotsylvania, Virginia. His plan was based on \"heaven-sent\" orders to free the slaves. He tried to recruit slaves from Orange, Spotsylvania, and Louisa counties to meet at his home with horses, guns, swords and clubs. He planned to attack and take over Fredericksburg and Richmond, Virginia. Lucy, a local slave, informed her owner, and the plot was foiled. Six slaves involved were imprisoned or executed. With his wife's help, Boxley escaped from the Spotsylvania County Jail and, despite a reward, he was never caught.\n\nBoxley fled to Ohio and Indiana, where he was joined by his family. He built a cabin in 1830, the first in Adams Township. He helped runaway slaves, taught school, and supported abolitionism. The George Boxley Cabin has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGeorge Boxley, a native of Virginia, was born in 1780. He was a merchant storekeeper and miller who became deeply committed to abolitionism. He arrived in Indiana as a fugitive from justice and was the first settler in Adams Township, Hamilton County, Indiana. Accounts vary in details, but the facts are that Boxley, himself a slaveowner, opposed—or came to oppose—the institution of slavery. Boxley was accused of helping slaves to escape and of fomenting a slave rebellion in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. Jailed, he made his escape aided by his wife Hannah. After fleeing Virginia, Boxley may have spent a brief time in Pennsylvania.\n\nVarious accounts indicate that he lived in Ohio and the Missouri Territory at different times, and that at least once he was confronted by bounty hunters but was able to elude them. His family eventually joined him each time he relocated. Finally Boxley headed to Indiana, pausing first at Strawtown with the idea of continuing westward to settle along the Wabash River. Sources indicate that on his way west through the heavily forested land, Boxley took note of what was to become his future home and decided to stake a claim there.\n\nIt was about 1828 that Boxley arrived to stay in Adams Township, his family soon joining him. Boxley recorded the of land on which he had built his cabin in 1830, the earliest in the township. Boxley was a well-read man and believed strongly in education. On his land, he soon constructed a small log school for his own children and those of other settlers starting to come into the area.\n\nBoxley is credited with establishing the first school in the township. He taught his pupils from the books in his own library, educating them in history, literature, law and politics, about which he held strong views. How long he kept the school going is unclear, but it was at least until about 1838, when a subscription school became available in the settlement of Englewood (later, Bakers Corner) roughly four miles to the east, and possibly even longer. In 1851, a township school was finally established near the southeast corner of Boxley's land.\n\nLocal folklore holds that Boxley participated in the Underground Railroad by hiding runaway slaves in an excavated place beneath his cabin. Certainly his abolitionist views were widely known, but there is no concrete evidence to document his having participated in the Underground Railroad. Such activity is known to have taken place to the southeast in the Westfield area, and some sources indicate there was a route that would have passed, and perhaps included, Boxley's cabin. On the other hand, since Boxley's strong libertarian and abolitionist sympathies were public knowledge, logic suggests that the Boxley property might have been a too obvious—and thus insecure—hiding place for fugitive slaves. But this would not have prevented him from helping in any number of other ways.\n\nGeorge Boxley married Hannah in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and they had 11 children together, some born after they left the South. While some were young adults when Boxley arrived in Indiana, the youngest among them were born in his years on the run. His youngest child became the first recorded death in the township: Benjamin Boxley was killed by a tree that fell on him during a severe thunderstorm.\n\nAfter the death of his wife in 1853, George Boxley had deteriorating health. At some point, he left his cabin to live with his son Caswell (1817–1891), a lawyer and schoolteacher. Caswell's first wife died in 1858, and possibly his father came to live with him at that time. Caswell rapidly remarried, finding a second wife, Sarah Ann Kercheval, whom he married in 1859. He also purchased his father's land then.\n\nGeorge Boxley died in 1865 and was buried in the cemetery of the town named after him.\n\n\n"}

It provides a central launching point for computer programs and performing other tasks. It has different names in different operating systems and window managers, such as \"Kickoff Application Launcher\" in KDE, \"Dash\" in GNOME and Unity, and \"Start screen\" in Windows 8.\n\nTraditionally, the Start menu provided a customizable nested list of programs for the user to launch, as well as a list of most recently opened documents, a way to find files and obtain assistance, and access to the system settings. Later enhancements via Windows Desktop Update included access to special folders such as \"My Documents\" and \"Favorites\" (browser bookmarks). Windows XP's Start menu was expanded to encompass various \"My Documents\" folders (including \"My Music\" and \"My Pictures\"), and transplanted other items like \"My Computer \"and \"My Network Places \"from the Windows desktop. Until Windows Vista, the Start menu was constantly expanded across the screen as the user navigated through its cascading sub-menus.\n\nIn Microsoft Windows, the Start menu in some form appears in Windows 9x, Windows NT 4.0 and all subsequent versions in the Windows NT family, as well as Windows CE, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.\n\nThe Start menu was introduced in Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, but had been worked on at Microsoft since 1992, originally being labelled as \"System\" to testers of the time. It was made to overcome the shortcomings of Program Manager in previous operating systems. Program Manager consisted of a simple multiple document interface (MDI) which allowed users to open separate \"program groups\" and then execute the shortcuts to programs contained within. It lacked the ability to nest groups within other groups.\n\nWindows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 replaced Program Manager with desktop and Start menu. The latter was comparable in some respects with the Apple menu in Mac OS operating systems and did not have the mentioned limitations of Program Manager: Being a menu, it allowed nested grouping while keeping only one group open at the time. The menu also offered the ability to shut down and log off from their computer.\n\nLater developments in Internet Explorer and subsequent Windows releases make it possible to customize the Start menu and to access and expand Internet Explorer Favorites, My Documents and Administrative Tools (Windows 2000 and later) from the Start menu. Items could also be simply added to the Start menu by dragging and dropping them.\n\nAlthough Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 introduced a new version of Start menu, they offered the ability to switch back to this version of Start menu. This version of the Start menu is also available in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. However, it is absent in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and other later Windows releases.\n\nThe first major overhaul to the Start menu was introduced in Windows XP and was later included in Windows Server 2003. The Start menu was expanded to two columns: the left-hand column focuses on installed programs, while the right-hand column provides access to My Documents, My Pictures, My Music and other special folders. This column also includes shortcuts for Computer and Network (\"Network Neighborhood\" in Windows 95 and 98), which were placed on the Desktop in prior versions of Windows. The contents of this column can be customized. Commonly used programs are automatically displayed in the left-hand menu. Users may opt to \"pin\" programs to this side of the Start menu so that they are always accessible. A sub-menu item at the bottom of this column grants access to all items of Start menu. When this menu item is selected, a scrolling list of start menu programs replaces the user/recent list.\n\nWindows Vista and its successors added minor changes to the menu. Prior to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Start menu consisted of a group of menus and sub-menus that cascaded and expanded, obscuring the initially visible portions of the screen beneath them. In Windows Vista, however, cascading menus were replaced by a sliding window in the left pane of the Start menu. Whenever All Programs item is clicked, the contents of the left pane slide off the left edge of the Start menu and the All Programs menu slides in from the right edge of the left column. This menu presents a tree view of it hierarchy that expands towards the bottom, with a vertical scrollbar whenever needed. Also added in Windows Vista is a \"Search\" box that allows users to search for the Start menu shortcuts or other files and folders. The search box features incremental search: If indexing is not turned off, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. Since the found items can be immediately opened, the Start menu search box partially replaces the function of Run command from previous versions of Windows. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu. In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the search results pane covers both columns of the Start menu. The search box is extended to support searching Control Panel items. The right column in Windows 7 links to Libraries instead of ordinary folders. Most importantly, however, items on the Start menu support \"Jump lists\" through cascade buttons on their right. Unlike prior versions, the ability to revert to the \"Classic\" Start menu design is no longer available.\n\nOn Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, an update to the Start menu known as the \"Start screen\" was introduced. It covers the entire screen and no longer features the right column. It shows much larger tiles for programs and, whenever possible, displays dynamic content supplied by the program directly on the tile itself (known as a \"live tile\"), behaving similarly to a widget. For instance, the live tile for an email client may display the number of unread emails. The Start screen allows users to uninstall their programs by right-clicking on them and selecting \"Uninstall\". Pinned apps can be placed in groups. The search box is initially hidden but can be viewed by clicking the search button on the charms bar and can also be brought up as it receives a keyboard input. True to its name, the Start screen is the first screen that a user sees upon login.\n\nThe idea of a full-screen Start can be traced back to Windows Neptune, when Microsoft originally considered a \"Start page\" that integrated with Windows desktop through Active Desktop. This menu has its roots in Windows Mobile and Windows Phone: In Windows Mobile Standard, which runs on smartphones, the Start menu produces a separate screen of icons. Windows Phone was the original host of the design principles of the third generation Start menu.\n\nThe Start screen no longer supports several previously available features. A list of recently launched program or shortcuts to special folders no longer appears on the Start screen. It no longer supports more than one level of nesting for groups in All Programs view. Drag and drop support for adding new items to the menu as well as reorganizing the contents of All Programs view is no longer available. In addition, for the first time in the history of Windows, the Start menu in a stock installation of Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 does not provide any facility for shutting down, restarting or activating sleep mode or hibernation, forcing users to use the settings button in the charms bar to perform these actions. An April 2014 update for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 restores the latter.\n\nWindows 10 re-introduced the Start menu in a revised form. It uses a two column design similar to Windows 7's version, except that the right side is populated by tiles, similarly to Windows 8's Start screen. Applications can be pinned to the right half, and their respective tiles can be resized and grouped into user-specified categories. The left column displays a vertical list, containing frequently-used applications, and links to the \"All apps\" menu, File Explorer, Settings, and power options. Some of these links, and additional links to folders such as Downloads, Pictures, and Music, can be added through Settings' \"Choose which folders appear on Start\" page. The Start menu can be resized, or be placed in a full-screen display resembling the Windows 8/8.1 Start screen (although scrolling vertically instead of horizontally). The Start menu also enters this state when \"Tablet mode\" is enabled.\n\nAs of build 10586, the left panel of the Start menu advertises \"suggested\" Windows Store apps; users can opt out of these suggestions. \n\nWindows RT 8.1 update KB3033055 adds a variant of the Windows 10 Start menu that is visually closer to the design used in early preview builds of Windows 10. It allows applications to be pinned to the top of the left column, with recently used apps listed below (much like 7), and as with 10, allows tiles to be pinned to the right column.\n\nThe Start menu may be launched either by pressing (the Windows key) on a keyboard or its equivalent on a tablet device, pressing CTRL+ESC on a keyboard, or by clicking on the visual Start button. With the exception of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the Start button can be found on the taskbar. On versions before Windows Vista, the Start Button consisted of the word \"Start\" and the Windows Logo (the word \"Start\" was localized for each different language version of the system, for instance, reading \"Avvio\" in Italian). On the Windows Vista and Windows 7 desktop, the word \"Start\" has been replaced by a blue Windows \"orb\" logo. However, the user can revert to displaying the word \"Start\" and the Windows Logo by setting the theme to \"Windows Classic\". The Start button on Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 is initially moved from the traditional taskbar to \"charms\", a hidden secondary taskbar located to the right of the screen (accessed by swiping in from the right on multitouch devices, or positioning the mouse in one of the right corners of the screen and sliding up or down). The Start screen is accessed either by that button or by clicking the lower left corner of the screen. Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 restore the button back to its original place without removing the new button in the charms.\n\nRight-clicking on the Start button invokes a context menu. This menu in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 is called the Quick Link menu and grants access to several frequently used features of Windows, such as accessing desktop or File Explorer.\n\nUsers may add Start menu entries by creating folders and shortcuts in the associated \"Start Menu\" folder, located on the operating system operating media. These appear in a separated section at the top of the Start menu, or, if placed in the Programs sub-folder, in the Programs menu. The location of this folder however, depends on the operating system installed:\n\n\nIn Windows Server 2003 and earlier, the folder name \"Start Menu\" has a different name on non-English versions of Windows. For example, on German versions of Windows XP it is \"codice_9\". Windows installers generally use the Windows API to find out the real names and locations of the Start menu and Desktop folders. However, since Windows Vista, all Versions of Windows use the same English named folders and only display different names in the Windows Explorer.\n\nTweakUI, an unsupported utility program from Microsoft, offers additional customizations, including speeding up the response time of the Start menu, window animation, and other hacks. On Windows XP and Windows Vista, it is possible to prevent specific programs from appearing in the recent programs list (the left pane of the Start menu) by modifying the Windows registry.\n\nMany desktop environments for open source operating systems provide a menu similar to the start menu:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2076709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076709", "title": "Concrete slab", "text": "Concrete slab\n\nA concrete slab is a common structural element of modern buildings, consisting of a flat, horizontal surface made of cast concrete. Steel-reinforced slabs, typically between 100 and 500 mm thick, are most often used to construct floors and ceilings, while thinner \"mud slabs\" may be used for exterior paving . \n\nIn many domestic and industrial buildings, a thick concrete slab supported on foundations or directly on the subsoil, is used to construct the ground floor. These slabs are generally classified as \"ground-bearing\" or \"suspended\". A slab is ground-bearing if it rests directly on the foundation, otherwise the slab is suspended. \nFor multi-storey buildings, there are several common slab designs :\n\nOn technical drawings, reinforced concrete slabs are often abbreviated to \"r.c.c. slab\" or simply \"r.c.\". Calculations and drawings are often done by structural engineers in CAD software.\n\nEnergy efficiency has become a primary concern for the construction of new buildings, and the prevalence of concrete slabs calls for careful consideration of its thermal properties in order to minimise wasted energy. Concrete has similar thermal properties to masonry products, in that it has a relatively high thermal mass and is a good conductor of heat.\n\nIn some special cases, the thermal properties of concrete have been employed, for example as a heatsink in nuclear power plants or a thermal buffer in industrial freezers.\n\nThermal conductivity of a concrete slab indicates the rate of heat transfer through the solid mass by conduction, usually in regard to heat transfer to or from the ground. The coefficient of thermal conductivity, \"k\", is proportional to density of the concrete, among other factors. The primary influences on conductivity are moisture content, type of aggregate, type of cement, constituent proportions, and temperature. These various factors complicate the theoretical evaluation of a \"k\"-value, since each component has a different conductivity when isolated, and the position and proportion of each components affects the overall conductivity. To simplify this, particles of aggregate may be considered to be suspended in the homogeneous cement. Campbell-Allen and Thorne (1963) derived a formula for the theoretical thermal conductivity of concrete. In practice this formula is rarely applied, but remains relevant for theoretical use. Subsequently, Valore (1980) developed another formula in terms of overall density. However, this study concerned hollow concrete blocks and its results are unverified for concrete slabs.\n\nThe actual value of \"k\" varies significantly in practice, and is usually between 0.8 and 2.0 W m K. This is relatively high when compared to other materials, for example the conductivity of wood may be as low as 0.04 W m K. One way of mitigating the effects of thermal conduction is to introduce insulation .\n\nThe second consideration is the high thermal mass of concrete slabs, which applies similarly to walls and floors, or wherever concrete is used within the thermal envelope. Concrete has a relatively high thermal mass, meaning that it takes a long time to respond to changes in ambient temperature. This is a disadvantage when rooms are heated intermittently and require a quick response, as it takes longer to warm the entire building, including the slab. However, the high thermal mass is an advantage in climates with large daily temperature swings, where the slab acts as a regulator, keeping the building cool by day and warm by night.\n\nTypically concrete slabs perform better than implied by their R-value. The R-value does not consider thermal mass, since it is tested under constant temperature conditions. Thus, when a concrete slab is subjected to fluctuating temperatures, it will respond more slowly to these changes and in many cases increase the efficiency of a building. In reality, there are many factors which contribute to the effect of thermal mass, including the depth and composition of the slab, as well as other properties of the building such as orientation and windows.\n\nThermal mass is also related to thermal diffusivity, heat capacity and insulation. Concrete has low thermal diffusivity, high heat capacity, and its thermal mass is negatively affected by insulation (e.g. carpet).\n\nWithout insulation, concrete slabs cast directly on the ground can cause a significant amount of extraneous energy transfer by conduction, resulting in either lost heat or unwanted heat. In modern construction, concrete slabs are usually cast above a layer of insulation such as expanded polystyrene, and the slab may contain underfloor heating pipes. However, there are still uses for a slab that is not insulated, for example in outbuildings which are not heated or cooled to room temperature . In these cases, casting the slab directly onto a substrate of aggregate will maintain the slab near the temperature of the substrate throughout the year, and can prevent both freezing and overheating.\n\nA common type of insulated slab is the beam and block system (mentioned above) which is modified by replacing concrete blocks with expanded polystyrene blocks. This not only allows for better insulation but decreases the weight of slab which has a positive effect on load bearing walls and foundations.\n\nGround-bearing slabs, also known as \"on-ground\" or \"slab-on-grade\", are commonly used for ground floors on domestic and some commercial applications. It is an economical and quick construction method for sites that have non-reactive soil and little slope.\n\nFor ground-bearing slabs, it is important to design the slab around the type of soil, since some soils such as clay are too dynamic to support a slab consistently across its entire area. This results in cracking and deformation, potentially leading to structural failure of any members attached to the floor, such as wall studs.\n\nLevelling the site before pouring concrete is an important step, as sloping ground will cause the concrete to cure unevenly and will result in differential expansion. In some cases, a naturally sloping site may be levelled simply by removing soil from the uphill site. If a site has a more significant grade, it may be a candidate for the \"cut and fill\" method, where soil from the higher ground is removed, and the lower ground is built up with fill.\n\nIn addition to filling the downhill side, this area of the slab may be supported on concrete piers which extend into the ground. In this case, the fill material is less important structurally as the dead weight of the slab is supported by the piers. However, the fill material is still necessary to support the curing concrete and its reinforcement.\n\nThere are two common methods of filling - \"controlled fill\" and \"rolled fill\".\n\n\nProper curing of ground-bearing concrete is necessary to obtain adequate strength. Since these slabs are inevitably poured on-site (rather than precast as some suspended slabs are), it can be difficult to control conditions to optimize the curing process. This is usually aided by a membrane, either plastic (temporary) or a liquid compound (permanent).\n\nGround-bearing slabs are usually supplemented with some form of reinforcement, often steel rebar. However, in some cases such as concrete roads, it is acceptable to use an unreinforced slab if it is adequately engineered .\n\nFor a suspended slab, there are a number of designs to improve the strength-to-weight ratio. In all cases the top surface remains flat, and the underside is modulated:\n\nUnreinforced or \"plain\" slabs are becoming rare and have limited practical applications, with one exception being the mud slab . They were once common in the USA, but the economic value of reinforced ground-bearing slabs has become more appealing for many engineers. Without reinforcement, the entire load on these slabs is supported by the strength of the concrete, which becomes a vital factor. As a result, any stress induced by a load, static or dynamic, must be within the limit of the concrete's flexural strength to prevent cracking. Since unreinforced concrete is relatively very weak in tension, it is important to consider the effects of tensile stress caused by reactive soil, wind uplift, thermal expansion, and cracking. One of the most common applications for unreinforced slabs is in concrete roads.\n\nMud slabs, also known as \"rat slabs\", are thinner than the more common suspended or ground-bearing slabs (usually 50 to 150 mm), and usually contain no reinforcement. This makes them economical and easy to install for temporary or low-usage purposes such as subfloors, crawlspaces, pathways, paving, and levelling surfaces. In general, they may be used for any application which requires a flat, clean surface. This includes use as a base or \"sub-slab\" for a larger structural slab. On uneven or steep surfaces, this preparatory measure is necessary to provide a flat surface on which to install rebar and waterproofing membranes. In this application, a mud slab also prevents the plastic bar chairs from sinking into soft topsoil which can cause spalling due to incomplete coverage of the steel. Sometimes a mud slab may be a substitute for coarse aggregate. Mud slabs typically have a moderately rough surface, finished with a float.\n\nA \"one-way slab\" has moment-resisting reinforcement only in its short axis, and is used when the moment in the long axis is negligible. Such designs include corrugated slabs and ribbed slabs. Non-reinforced slabs may also be considered one-way if they are supported on only two opposite sides (i.e. they are supported in one axis). A one-way reinforced slab may be stronger than a two-way non-reinforced slab, depending on the type of load.\n\nThe calculation of One Way Slab Reinforcement Details Design is extremely tedious and time-consuming and after give more time is not 100% sure that design is best or not and also if some minor change comes in design if force to calculate full design step again and again \n\nAlso, there are so many factor work as silent during structure design of one way slab as belove\nEffective Span\n\n\nA \"two-way slab\" has moment resisting reinforcement in both directions. This may be implemented due to application requirements such as heavy loading, vibration resistance, clearance below the slab, or other factors. However, an important characteristic governing the requirement of a two-way slab is the ratio of the two horizontal lengths. If formula_1 where formula_2 is the short dimension and formula_3 is the long dimension, then moment in both directions should be considered in design. In other words, if the axial ratio is greater than two, a two-way slab is required.\n\nA non-reinforced slab is two-way if it is supported in both horizontal axes.\n\nA concrete slab may be prefabricated (precast), or constructed on site.\n\nPrefabricated concrete slabs are built in a factory and transported to the site, ready to be lowered into place between steel or concrete beams. They may be pre-stressed (in the factory), post-stressed (on site), or unstressed. It is vital that the wall supporting structure is built to the correct dimensions, or the slabs may not fit.\n\nOn-site concrete slabs are built on the building site using formwork - a type of boxing into which the wet concrete is poured. If the slab is to be reinforced, the rebars, or metal bars, are positioned within the formwork before the concrete is poured in. Plastic-tipped metal or plastic bar chairs, are used to hold the rebar away from the bottom and sides of the form-work, so that when the concrete sets it completely envelops the reinforcement. This concept is known as concrete cover. For a ground-bearing slab, the formwork may consist only of side walls pushed into the ground. For a suspended slab, the formwork is shaped like a tray, often supported by a temporary scaffold until the concrete sets.\n\nThe formwork is commonly built from wooden planks and boards, plastic, or steel. On commercial building sites, plastic and steel are gaining popularity as they save labour. On low-budget or small-scale jobs, for instance when laying a concrete garden path, wooden planks are very common. After the concrete has set the wood may be removed, or left there permanently.\n\nIn some cases formwork is not necessary - for instance, a ground slab surrounded by brick or block foundation walls, where the walls act as the sides of the tray and hardcore (rubble) acts as the base.\n\n"}

Jenkins. The Global Community was established as the successor of the United Nations by Nicolae Carpathia, the series' main antagonist.\n\nAt its territorial peak, the GC controlled the entire world. Initially the state was a peaceful union of nations. As time passed by however, the state increasingly became anti-Christian and despotic. Ultimately it was destroyed after the second coming of Christ.\n\nThe Global Community was born out of the immediate aftermath of the Rapture, an event that caused millions of people to disappear from the face of the Earth. Due to the mass disappearances, the world descends into chaos and mass hysteria. The disappearances happen a week after the newly elected United Nations General Assembly starts session. On the same day of the Rapture, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mwangati Ngumo, resigns. He is immediately replaced with worldwide approval by a 33-year-old Romanian politician named Nicolae Carpathia, who was elected to the open position supposedly against his will.\n\nAfter \"reluctantly\" accepting the office, Carpathia calls for all nations to destroy 90% of their weapons and donate the remaining 10% to the United Nations – a call that was eventually accepted by all heads of state. In less than a month Carpathia established a new, permanent, ten-member Security Council. He also moves the U.N. headquarters to New Babylon, a new city which was built over the ruins of Ancient Babylon. Carpathia finally changes the name of the United Nations to the Global Community and appoints himself Supreme Potentate, the leader of the new world government.\n\nAs the Supreme Potentate of the Global Community, Nicolae Carpathia establishes its headquarters at the Global Community Palace in New Babylon. For the first few years Carpathia worked to unify and merge all businesses, industries and media outlets through either financial means (being the sole beneficiary of Jonathan Stonagal, the richest man in history) or by mind control and putting them under GC authority. Carpathia also established new organizations to keep control of the population, including Global Community Cable News Network (GCCNN), Global Community Peacekeepers, Global Community Morale Monitors, Global Community Aeronautics and Space Administration (GCASA), Global Community Power and Light (GCP&L), and Enigma Babylon One World Faith. A new single global currency called the Global Community Dollar, nicknamed \"Nicks\" (after Carpathia himself), is established. In less than a year, the Global Community is the dominant state on Earth, with Carpathia at its head. As a result of the GC's rise, New Babylon becomes the biggest, richest, most advanced and most beautiful city in the world.\n\nCarpathia divides the world into ten regions: the United North American States, the United European States, the United Carpathian States (Middle East; before events in \"The Indwelling\" it was called the United Holy Land States), the United Asian States, the United South American States, the United Russian States, the United Indian States, the United Pacific States, the United African States, and the United Great Britain States. This partitioning eventually comes into play as ten sub-potentates are given control over each region, representing the ten kings prophesied in the Book of Revelation. Each region is assigned a code number, which is to be the marking used for the loyalty mark system established by Carpathia. (The code is based on a mathematical equation involving three sixes; example: United Carpathian States: 6 x 6 x 6 = 216).\n\nIn \"Assassins\", Carpathia is assassinated during the last day of the Global Gala. After three days however he is resurrected at the Global Community Palace during his own funeral, attended by four million people from around the world.\n\nThe Global Community had far-reaching gasp as it owned several significant corporations, from media to technology. The following is the known departments of he Global Community.\n\n\nAfter his return to power at the end of \"The Indwelling\", Carpathia, proclaiming himself to be God, establishes Carpathianism as the world's only legal religion, replacing the Enigma Babylon One World Faith. Leon Fortunato the newly appointed Most High Reverend Father goes to the Vatican to establish Carpathianism with himself as its leader. Statues (varying in construction materials, color, and size) of Carpathia are erected in every possible locale; citizens are expected to worship one of these statues three times a day, on penalty of death. Eventually, Carpathia orders that all GC citizens take a mark proclaiming their allegiance to him and the state. The discipline method for refusing to take the mark is death by guillotine, nicknamed the \"loyalty enforcement facilitator\". As millions take the loyalty mark, Carpathia, growing tired of the resistance being put up by Christians, Orthodox Jews, and some Muslims, issues a kill-on-sight order for all non-Carpathians.\n\nIn \"Armageddon\", Carpathia establishes the \"Global Community One World Unity Army\", composed of all the GC military forces. It was created to destroy the rebel stronghold of Petra and take over Jerusalem, which was to become the new capital of Carpathia's empire after the supernatural destruction of New Babylon.\n\nThe Global Community was finally defeated at the Battle of Armageddon. In the battle, the Unity Army is destroyed in its entirety. After the battle Carpathia and Fortunato are cast into the biblical Lake of Fire, where they would be tormented for eternity.\n\n\n"}

In its youth (\"Chavignol jeune\"), its dough is solid and compact, and its rind is white. As it ripens (\"Chavignol bleuté\"), it takes on a stronger flavour and develops a harder rind. With full maturity (\"Chavignol affiné\"), the dough becomes crumbly and the mould on the rind matures into a bluish colour. The cheese is marketed and eaten at all three stages of maturity.\n\nA classic dish is baked Crottin de Chavignol on a green salad. The dish is said to go well with a Sancerre wine from its home region.

After his parents divorced and he bounced around from home to home, he made his way to Orlando, Florida. He worked at Orlando's ABC TV affiliate WLOF-TV Channel 9 as a cameraman and director. In his 20s, he packed up and moved to Hollywood to try to find work.\n\nIn the 1970s, he helped found the Met Theatre in Los Angeles. While performing there, a rep from The Public Theater saw him and had him cast as Weston in Sam Shepard's \"Curse of the Starving Class\" in 1978. The two became friends afterward. He made his sole Broadway appearance as \"Dodge\" in a revival of Sam Shepard's \"Buried Child\". He was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance. He also appeared on stage in Shepard's San Francisco debut of \"The Late Henry Moss\" along with Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Cheech Marin and Woody Harrelson in 2000.\n\nGammon may be best-remembered for his characters Lou Brown, manager of the Cleveland Indians in the \"Major League\" films, and Nick Bridges, the father of Don Johnson's title character in the television series \"Nash Bridges\".

The obverse features a crowned effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, facing right, in a high-collared ermine cloak and wearing the collar of the Garter and Badge of the Bath. There is no raised rim and no legend.\n\nThe reverse shows the Royal Cypher \"EIIR\", surmounted by a large crown. The legend around the edge reads \"QUEEN ELIZABETH II CROWNED 2nd JUNE 1953\". The medal was designed by Cecil Thomas.\n\nThe dark red ribbon is wide, with wide white edges and two narrow dark blue stripes in the centre, each wide and apart.\n\nLadies who were awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, can wear it on their left shoulder with the ribbon tied in the form of a bow.\n\nThe medals were issued unnamed, except for the 37 issued to the British Mount Everest Expedition. These were engraved \"MOUNT EVEREST EXPEDITION\" on the rim.\n\nSome orders of precedence are as follows:\n\nThe following list includes notable New Zealanders who received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, and is not an exhaustive list of recipients.\n"}

{"id": "2076781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076781", "title": "Ascension of Isaiah", "text": "Ascension of Isaiah\n\nThe Ascension of Isaiah is a pseudepigraphical Jewish-Christian text. Scholarly estimates regarding the date of the Ascension of Isaiah range anywhere between the final decades of the first century to the early decades of the third century, though scholars prefer some time in the early 2nd century. The reason for this large range in dating is due to the fact that there is virtually no information that allows for a confident dating into any specific period. Many scholars believe it to be a compilation of several texts completed by an unknown Christian scribe who claimed to be the Prophet Isaiah, while an increasing number of scholars in recent years have argued that the work is a unity by a single author that may have used utilized multiple sources.\n\nIt is generally believed that the text is composed of three different sections written at different times, by different authors. The earliest section, regarding chapters 3:13-4:22, was composed at about the end of the first century AD or perhaps early second century and is believed to be a text of Jewish origins which was later on redacted by Christian scribes. The date of the Vision of Isaiah (chapters 6-11) is rather more difficult to determine, but it is no more recent than the third century, since Saint Jerome (c. 347-420 AD) cites a fragment of the work in some of his writings, but from internal evidence it seems that the text is to be placed before the end of the second century AD. The whole work was on a later date assembled as M.A. Kinibb writes:\n\nIt is not known when exactly the three sections of the Ascension were combined. The Greek fragment (from the 5th-6th cent.), the palimpsest giving the text of the fragments of the first Latin translation (likewise from the 5th-6th cent.), and the Ethiopic translation (which was made some time during the 4th-6th cent.) all presuppose the existence of the complete work. But the character of the mistakes in the Greek fragment and the Latin palimpsest suggests that the complete work had already been in existence for some time when these manuscripts were copied. It thus seems likely that the three sections of the Ascension were brought together in the third or fourth century A.D., and this is confirmed by the fact that Jerome seems to have known the complete book. It is possible that there were two stages in the process, first the combination of 3:13-4:22 with the Martyrdom, and second the combination of the enlarged Martyrdom with the Vision.\n\nKnibb thus dates the whole text as being written between AD 150 and 200 but assembled at a later time. Most scholars agree that a mid to early second century date for the principal portion of the document is probable, dateable in its present to the least the early part of the second century.\n\nThe book has three main sections:\n\nElements of the \"Ascension of Isaiah\" are paralleled in other Jewish and Christian writings. The method of Isaiah's death (sawn in half by Manasseh) is agreed upon by both the Babylonian Talmud and Jerusalem Talmud and is probably alluded to by the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (11:37). The demon Beliar appears in quite a number of apocryphal works, including the \"Book of Jubilees\", the \"Book of Enoch\", the \"Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs\", and the \"Sibylline Oracles\". Finally, Isaiah's journey through the Seven Heavens parallels that of Enoch in the \"Second Book of Enoch\".\n\nThe first section of the text also contains hostility toward the Samaritans, a Jewish sect that claim to be Jews left behind during the Babylonian exile disowned by the remainder.\n\nSome scholars have noted that the Ascension reflects a proto-Trinitarian perspective, such as when the inhabitants of the sixth heaven sing praises to \"the primal Father and his Beloved Christ, and the Holy Spirit\". Larry Hurtado writes;\n\nThe most extended narrative of heavenly worship is in 9.27-42, however, where a similar triadic view is presented. Having reached the seventh heaven, which is bathed in incomparable light, Isaiah sees innumerable angels and \"all the righteous from the time of Adam onwards\" (9.6-9). Then, after his angel guide explains how the descent of the Beloved One will make it possible for the righteous to receive their robes, crowns, and thrones (9.10-26), Isaiah sees a figure \"whose glory surpassed that of all\" being worshiped by Adam, Abel, and all the other righteous and angels (9.27-28). Crucially, at this point the angel guide directs Isaiah to \"Worship this one,\" whom the angel identifies as \"the Lord of all the praise which you have seen\" (9.31-32), the Beloved One; Isaiah joins in the worship and sung praise directed to this figure. Then another glorious figure approaches, subsequently identified as \"the angel of the Holy Spirit who has spoken in you and also in the other righteous\" (9.36), and Isaiah is likewise told\nto join the angels in worshiping this one (9.35-36). Finally, in a carefully prepared climax to this scene, Isaiah sees \"the Great Glory\" (but with his spirit, for it appears that his eyes are blinded by the light of this glory, 9.37), and he relates how \"my Lord\" and \"the angel of the Spirit\" both offered worship to this third figure, along with \"all the righteous\" and the angels (9.40-42).\n\nThe \"Ascension of Isaiah\" suggests early Christian belief in subordinationism, similar to that of Origen and, later, Novatian. The text describes the worship of the \"Great Glory\" by the \"Beloved\" and the \"Angel of the Holy Spirit,\" implying hierarchy in the ranks of the trinity. Further, it is suggested that the angels escorting Isaiah in his ascension are none other than Jesus (\"the Beloved\") and the Angel of the Holy Spirit. By the text labeling Jesus and the Holy Spirit as angelic beings, a Christology and pneumatology are established that distinguish \"the LORD\" from \"my LORD\" and the Holy Spirit. This would be cause to label the story as heretical in the Western Orthodox tradition, along with similar theological beliefs, such as Arianism. Nonetheless, early Jewish-Christians, most likely in the Palestinian region, would have found this story influential in understanding theology, pneumatology and Christology, largely due to its referral to the Hebrew scriptures' prophets.\n\nTheological demons noted in the text are:\n\nAccording to the theory of R. H. Charles, the text incorporates three distinct sections, each once a separate work that is a single compilation here. Of these, one, the first, appears to have been written by a Jewish author, and the other two by Christians. \nAccording to this author, \"The Martyrdom\" consists of:\n\nE. Norelli suggests on the contrary that the whole text, even if written in different times, is the expression of a docetic Christian prophetic group related with the group attacked by Ignatius of Antioch in his letters to the Smyrnaeans and to the Trallians. According to this scholar chapters 6-11 (the Vision) are older than chapters 1-5 (which represent a later pessimistic introduction to the original Vision), the date of composition is the end of the 1st century AD, and the narrative of Mary's pregnancy (AI 11:2-5) is independent from the Gospel of Matthew. Recently, other scholars have rejected characterizing the Ascension of Isaiah as a docetic text.\n\nThe text exists as a whole in three Ge'ez manuscripts of around the 15th-18th centuries, but fragments have also survived in Greek, Coptic, Latin, and Old Church Slavonic. All three component texts appear to have been in Greek, and it is possible that the \"Martyrdom of Isaiah\" derives from a Hebrew or Aramaic original. Comparison of the various translations suggests that two different recensions of the Greek original must have existed; one on which the Ethiopic and one of the Latin versions were based, and the other on which the Slavonic and the other Latin version were based. Fragments of both Greek versions have survived. The work's current title is derived from the title used in the Ethiopic manuscripts (\"'Ergata Īsāyèyās\" – \"The Ascension of Isaiah\"). In antiquity, Epiphanius also referred to it by this title (in Greek: Τὸ Αναβατικὸν Ἡσαΐου), as did Jerome (in Latin: \"Ascensio Isaiæ\").\n\n\n\n"}

He grew up in Newport, Oregon, attended the University of Oregon and worked on a number of campaigns before taking office as a Portland commissioner. Among them was Vera Katz's run for mayor of Portland. After she won, he served as her chief of staff for eleven years and then went back to school, earning a degree in Political Science.\n\nIn 2004, Adams was elected to the Portland City Council, serving four years on the council earning a reputation as a \"policy-driven advocate for sustainability, the arts, and gay rights\". He was elected to a four-year term as mayor of Portland in the May 2008 primary, with 58% of the vote and a dozen other candidates on the ballot. He was the first openly gay mayor of a top-30 U.S. city. In July 2011, Adams announced that he would not seek a second term as mayor. He had an approval rating of 56% eight months before he left office. In 2020 he announced his candidacy for Portland City Commission, challenging incumbent Chloe Eudaly.\n\nSamuel Adams was born at St. James Hospital in Butte, Montana, on September 3, 1963. He is the third of four children born to Larry Adams—a special education teacher and high school basketball coach—and his wife, Karalie (née Gibbons). When Adams was born his family lived on ranch eight miles outside Whitehall, Montana. When he was a year old, his family moved to Richland, Washington, for a year, and then on to Newport, Oregon. His maternal grandfather Francis Gibbons immigrated from Ireland to Portland. Because of the Irish birth of his maternal grandfather, Adams holds dual Irish and American citizenship. In 1966, Adams and his family moved from Montana to the Oregon coast.\n\nAs a boy, Adams and his friends were almost always outside, rain or shine, fishing and crabbing off the cannery docks and digging for clams in the mudflats. \"The only thing that would bring him inside was food,\" said Adams' Mom.\n\nWhen Adams was thirteen, his parents moved to Eugene, Oregon, where they divorced. Adams and his three siblings lived with their mother and survived at times on food stamps and public housing assistance. When his mother could not find work in Eugene in 1979 and moved to Portland, Adams stayed in Eugene, living largely on his own and supported himself working as a cook at a Mr. Steak restaurant throughout most of his high school years.\n\nHe graduated from high school in 1982, then started at the University of Oregon in 1984, but did not finish. Adams went back to college while working full time in 1999, at Portland State University. He graduated with a BA in Political Science in 2002 from the University of Oregon.\n\nSummarizing his early life, the Willamette Week noted that Adams \"got a rough start in life. Not a lot of closeted, bullied, small-town welfare kids with divorced parents grow up to be the mayor of a major U.S. city. But unlike some politicians, Adams has not made his personal story a platform. His tough upbringing in Newport shapes his priorities.\"\n\nAdams began his career in politics as a staffer on Peter DeFazio's 1986 campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in Oregon's 4th district. He dropped out of the University of Oregon to work on Peter DeFazio's successful bid for Congress. Not earning much, to save money, he sleep on a floor futon in the campaign headquarters.\" After DeFazio won, Adams worked as a communications and policy assistant in his Oregon office, and on his reelection campaigns until 1988 when, Sam went to work for the Democratic House Campaign Committee, in Salem, Oregon and for Democratic Majority Leaders David Dix and Carl Hosticka.\n\nAdams' first political position on his own came in 1988 when he was elected Chair of the Lane County (Oregon) Democratic Party. In 1990, Adams worked as the Oregon director for the highway safety organization Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways (CRASH). He next worked on Vera Katz's mayoral campaign in Portland and served eleven years as her Chief of Staff. He remained closeted at work until he became her Chief of Staff in 1993. He broke the news for the first time to a prospective employer to Mayor Vera Katz in 1992 after she offered him the job as her campaign manager, to which she replied 'Sweetie, I don't give a damn.'\" In discussing not disclosing his sexuality, Adams noted he came from a \"family of tough Montanans\" where \"there's a premium on being tough and strong, and being queer and a faggot wasn't strong\".\n\nIn a 2004 election for a seat on the Portland City Council, Adams won significantly fewer votes than rival Nick Fish in the primary election, but defeated Fish in the general election. Following the primary, Adams shifted campaign managers and tactics from a focus on traditional fundraising to grassroots outreach.\n\nAdams was Portland's Commissioner of Public Utilities. He ran the Portland Office of Transportation (commonly abbreviated as \"PDOT\") and the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES). He also served as Portland City Council's liaison to the Arts and Culture and Small Business communities. As part of managing PDOT, he inherited the responsibility to oversee development of the Portland Aerial Tram, one of the world's few urban aerial trams. It links the South Waterfront district to the upper campus of Oregon Health & Science University. During its development, the project was plagued with cost overruns and opposition from some residents impacted by the project. When Adams assumed responsibility, he replaced the external consultants responsible for the poor cost estimates with in-house expertise. The project was completed on time and within the revised budget with the tram opened to the public in January 2007.\n\nAdams and his staff maintained a blog highlighting their activities in the community, especially pertaining to Adams' priorities such as arts and culture, livability and environment, and transportation.\n\nIn October 2007 Adams announced his intentions to run for Mayor of Portland and kicked off his campaign at the Wonder Ballroom in Northeast Portland in February 2008. His main opponent was Sho Dozono, a civic leader and businessman, although 13 candidates filed for mayor. In the primary election, held May 20, 2008, Adams captured 58 percent of the vote and was elected without the need for a run-off. Dozono, his nearest opponent, received 34 percent of the vote. Adams took office on January 1, 2009. Portland became the largest U.S. city to have ever elected an openly gay mayor. (In December 2009 Houston, Texas, the nation's fourth largest city, elected Annise Parker, who is an out lesbian, surpassing Portland as the largest American city ever to have an openly gay mayor. Houston was the largest city to have elected an openly gay mayor until Lori Lightfoot was elected mayor of Chicago in 2019)\n\nIn 2009, Adams in his inauguration speech said his top three priorities were creating more family-wage jobs, reducing the high school dropout rate, and making Portland more sustainable.\n\nIn his first State of the City address on February 27, 2009, Adams outlined his goal of making Portland \"the most sustainable city in the world\". Adams emphasized reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and investment in efficient green energy as essential to the city's energy-environmental goals and called on the Oregon State Legislature to provide incentives for the expansion of green energy companies, notably Vestas Wind Systems, into the Portland metropolitan area.\n\nLater that year, Adams was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing related to a consensual sexual relationship with a young adult he met in 2005. Adams said the deception about the relationship was warranted because a political opponent had falsely accused him of having sex with a minor, but later apologized.\n\nThat year he also established a local economic stimulus plan by fast-tracking capital improvement projects, secured a Major League Soccer franchise, began work on the Oregon Sustainability Center established a free-bus-ride program designed to help low-income students more easily get to school, helped secure $2.5 million in new grants designed to help the city reduce diesel emissions, began construction of 15 miles of bike boulevards, and consolidated the city's permitting process.\n\nAdams announced his support of new regulations for horse-drawn carriages in September 2009 after a horse died in downtown Portland a month earlier. Adams recommended that planners at the Revenue Bureau write new city codes that would cover working conditions for equine businesses and their animals.\n\nIn September 2009, he opposed the $4 billion, twelve-lane replacement for the I-5 bridge over the Columbia River, a plan he had once supported. Adams stated, \"I'd rather settle for a bad bridge for another 25 years than a terrible bridge that punishes Portland for another 100 years.\" The twelve-lane idea was a compromise deal Adams helped write with then-Mayor Royce Pollard of Vancouver, Washington, in February, 2009. That deal helped get the Portland City Council to agree for a bridge of up to twelve lanes, something Vancouver wanted in exchange for its support of Portland's MAX Light Rail extension across the I-5 bridge. Adams focused on improving the local economy by attracting large, sustainable employers to Portland, including a $200-million investment by the company Vestas.\n\nIn 2010, Adams in his State of the City address was praised by environmental organizations and criticized by coal advocates for his successful efforts to shrink Portland's carbon footprint through programs such as Clean Energy Works, the nation's first on-bill financing for home retrofitting. Adams also became known for leading the creation of Portland's \"Citizen Reports\" iPhone application. He also appeared in \"Portlandia\"'s second episode as Sam, assistant to the Mayor of Portland.\nIn November of that year, Adams fired the police chief and then fired a police officer who had shot and killed an unarmed citizen. He recruited a wind company to spend $66 million on development and hire 400 employees, established the city's first economic development plan, developed programs designed to reduce Portland's high school dropout rate and make the city more sustainable, and, along with the rest of the city council, adopted gun control regulations that are designed to reduce shootings.\n\nIn 2011, Adams established curbside composting, banned single-use plastic bags, adopted a transgender-inclusive health plan for city employees, recruited a photovoltaic company to move to and invest $340 million in infrastructure in Portland, recruited several TV and movie companies to do business and spend about $100 million on production in Portland, established the $2.1 million seed fund to help start-up businesses in Portland, supported Occupy Portland at first, but later dispersed the camps, and cracked down on gangs with a 14-month police undercover operation that resulted in the arrests of 31 gang members.\n\nOn July 29, 2011, Adams announced on his official city blog that he would not seek a second term as Portland's mayor.\nJust 16 days after expiration of his term as Mayor of Portland, Sam Adams was named as Executive Director of the City Club of Portland, a non-profit organization best known as the host of public civic policy meetings. After applying for the job in December 2012, Adams was selected from a pool of 80 applicants for the position, which paid him $80,000 in 2013.\n\nAdams characterized his new position as a \"fantastic opportunity to do community building, work on improving the civic health of the city, and to support the members' work in researching tough public policy issues. Established in 1916, the City Club of Portland had about 1500 members and four paid employees in 2013. During his two-year tenure, City Club membership grew by 47 percent and corporate sponsorships doubled.\n\nOn January 14, 2014, Adams announced that he was leaving the City Club to become director of U.S. Climate Initiatives at the World Resources Institute, a global nonprofit dedicated to environmental sustainability. Adams moved to Washington, D.C. as a result.\n\nIn November of 2017, Adams was accused of sexual harassment by a former aide when he was mayor, and in December of 2017, he left his position at the World Resources Institute, although the allegations were not a factor in his choice to resign.\n\nFrom 1992 until 2004, Adams was in a long-term relationship with Greg Eddie. During that time, in 1993, he was outed as gay by the alternative newspaper \"Willamette Week.\" In 2007, the former couple, in a challenge to the state constitution, filed suit against the State of Oregon to dissolve their domestic partnership and divide Adams' future pension. After his break-up with Eddie, Adams was, for the first time, both openly gay and single. Adams lamented his lack of \"gaydar\". He said this made him decide to date only men who asked him out first.\n\nIn 2005, Adams met Beau Breedlove, a 17-year-old interning for Oregon State Representative Kim Thatcher. In September 2007, Adams denied rumors of a sexual relationship between the two, calling the allegations scurrilous, and adding that they played into stereotypes of predatory gays. In January 2009, after being confronted with a story in \"Willamette Week\", Adams acknowledged lying about the nature of their sexual relationship. Breedlove confirmed Adams' accounts. Adams apologized, saying he had lied to avoid accusations of grooming a minor and the likely disruption such allegations would cause in his mayoral campaign. Adams cited the \"swift public condemnation\" of former mayor and governor Neil Goldschmidt in 2004 by the news media as weighing heavily in his decision to lie. \"[N]o one's going to believe me [that he was eighteen]\". Oregon had already seen several prominent political sex scandals; prior to Goldschmidt's, there was one involving Senator Bob Packwood in 1992. The \"well-funded newsroom\" of \"The Oregonian\" had been criticized for failing to pursue both stories. In the Goldschmidt case, the \"Oregonian\" publicly debated with \"Willamette Week\" over which publication reported more accurately and aggressively. Adams also announced his intention to remain in office.\n\nNews of the deception led Oregon Attorney General John Kroger to initiate a criminal investigation in January 2009. By June, his office announced that no charges would be filed and that there was \"no credible evidence\" of inappropriate sexual contact before the age of consent. Before Kroger's findings were made public, several newspapers called for Adams' resignation. \"The Portland Mercury\" and the board of the Portland Area Business Association, the LGBTQ chamber of commerce, spoke out against resignation. \"Out\" magazine columnist Dan Savage noted what they saw as hypocrisy, homophobia, and sex panic about age disparity in sexual relationships. In July 2009 a recall campaign asserted that Adams had lost the trust of the public and other elected officials to ill effect on the city's economy. It fell short of gathering the necessary number of signatures. A second effort began in late 2009, with financial backing from over a dozen regional businesses. The backers posited that a \"lack of trust and political capital\" was affecting their businesses' bottom lines. However, it too failed due to lack of sufficient signatures.\n\nAdams also dated Christopher Stowell, artistic director of Oregon Ballet Theatre. Adams met his partner Peter Zuckerman in 2008. Zuckerman is an American journalist and author who has focused his career on court reporting, investigative journalism, adventure stories, and socially progressive political campaigns.\n\nAdams had a recurring role on the IFC show \"Portlandia\" as assistant to Portland's fictional mayor played by Kyle MacLachlan. He also appeared as himself in \"The Hour of Death\", a 2012 episode of the Portland-based NBC show \"Grimm\".\n"}

The first classes consisted of 30 students and faculty; the initial schedule consisting of a half day, six days per week and was inclusive of only six grades. Middle and high school grade children were included sometime between November 1946 and March 1947. The school newspaper was \"The Quonsetter\". There was no yearbook printed in 1947.\n\nIn the fall of 1947 classes opened the school year in a group of 15 Butler-type prefabricated buildings in the Awase housing area with 177 students and 11 teachers serving grades 1 through 12. 1947-1948 was the first year that high school seniors attended Okinawa University School. A problem with graduating seniors was the lack of accreditation of the school; however, on March 11, 1948 through the efforts of Dr. Theodora Koob, Okinawa University School received accreditation from The Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools.\n\nThe first school yearbook was printed in 1948 and was called the \"Torii\". The school newspaper was called the \"Typhoon\". In July 1949, Typhoon Gloria destroyed the school and delayed the opening of the school year.

In November of that year, the school name was changed to \"Okinawa-American Dependent High School\" and moved back to the Awase Housing Area in quonset huts. Later, communist aggression on the Korean Peninsula necessitated a ban on dependent travel in East Asia, resulting in few new students enrolled until 1951. At some point before 1952, the school name was changed to Okinawa-American Dependent School. In 1952 during the publication of the fifth \"Torii\", the Dragon was chosen as the mascot.\n\nBy 1952 rising enrollment forced a move to another set of quonsets at the Army Training School at Camp Kubasaki. The high school kids were moved to the new campus at Camp Kubasaki while the elementary and middle school kids remained at Awase. The name of the high school was changed in the fall of 1952 to Okinawa-American Dependents High School. Sometime between the fall of 1952 and the fall of 1955 the school name was changed again to Kubasaki American High School,\n\nIn the Fall of 1957, the school was moved into partitioned barracks in the Port Wheel area of Naha. By the early 1960s, the school was hosting grades 10 through 12.\n\nTo begin the school year in the fall of 1964, the school moved to its present and permanent location in the Kishaba Terrace housing area, adjacent to the U.S. Army post of Fort Buckner, and was renamed Kubasaki High School.\n\nKubasaki High School has withstood destruction from fire and typhoons on six campuses in five locations and with four names.\n\nStudent activities and groups include Associated Student Body, Chorus, Class elected officers, Seminar Representatives, Drama, Far East Activity Council events, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Future Educators of America, Band, MCJROTC, Model United Nations, Intellectual Cultural Society, Chess Club, Ryukyuan American Tomodachi Organization, Mu Alpha Theta, National Honor Society, School Newspaper (\"Typhoon\"), Science & Humanities Symposium, Student-2-Student, Yearbook (\"Torii\"), and International Thespian Society.\n\nTyphoon. The student newspaper of Kubasaki High School was established in 1964, when the present day Kubasaki High School was opened in Kishaba Terrace. During the late 1960s, the school newspaper gained national and international fame, winning 12 straight All American ratings from the National Scholastic Press Association (NSPA). In 1972, it was shortlisted for the Pacemaker Award as the top high school newspaper in America, edited that year by Joe Van Eaton. Quill and Scroll awarded the Typhoon the George H. Gallup Award for excellence in 1972 (edited by Mark Tunis). John Weldon was principal at this time. The Typhoon has been the only Department of Defense high school to win an All American rating and was under the advisership of Bill Hobbs. The student newspaper was printed locally by Okinawan printers. The Typhoon was the product of both extra-curricular students and the journalism class, taught and advised by Bill Hobbs.\n\nTorii. The student yearbook of Kubasaki was founded prior to 1956. In 1967, the Torii began production on a much larger scale, eventually becoming the largest single school Department of Defense high school yearbook with 336 pages in 1973, advised by Bill Hobbs. (This record was eclipsed in 1987 when Focus, student yearbook of Frankfurt (Germany) American High School published an All American book of 352 pages.) In 1971, edited by sophomore Frank Day, the Torii received an All American rating (the first of any DoD high school) by the NSPA. The Torii was printed stateside after the new Kubasaki was established in 1964. Principal Virginia Lee was instrumental in making the yearbook \"more stateside\" in its production and Walsworth Publishing CO., with a representative in the Far East advised. In 1973, when the school had almost 2000 students, grade 10 through 12, some 1200 copies were ordered from Taylor Publishing Co.\n\nQuill and Scroll honorary journalistic society was established at Kubasaki High School in the spring of 1971, with Teresa Sheehan as its first president. In 1973, under its president Harvey Humphrey, this chapter was named the Bill Hobbs Chapter in honor of its founding adviser.\n\nThe Kubasaki Dragons compete in interscholastic competition with other DoDDS schools and local Okinawan schools. Kubasaki fields teams in baseball, boys' and girls' basketball, coed cheerleading, girls' and boys' cross country, football, boys' and girls' golf, boys' and girls' soccer, softball, boys' and girls' tennis, boys' and girls' track and field, girls' volleyball, and wrestling. High school students can also join the local Okinawa Dolphins swim team and earn a letter.\n\nKubasaki has a legacy of prep football legacy from the start of the Cold War era.\n\nAs KHS was the only school on the island with active varsity and JV gridiron programs at the time, teams were determined by the general location on-island the players were from. From the 1950s through the 1980s, Kubasaki's legacy teams and colors were Kadena Falcons (blue & white), Sukiran (later Zukeran) Knights (black & white), and Naha Eagles (red & white).\n\nThe team names, mascots, and colors carried-over to Kubasaki's basketball and wrestling squads.\n\nAs there was no football field or stadium at Kubasaki's previous campuses (and, until recently, the present Kishaba campus), each team had their respective \"home field\" stadium. MacDonald Stadium on Kadena Air Base was home to the Falcons; the Sukiran Knights shared Rambler Field at Sukiran Stadium in the Camp Sukiran Troop Area (now known as Marine Corps Base Camp Foster) with the Army's intramural football team, the Rangers; and the Eagles claimed Naha Field at Naha Air Base as their home turf.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, a fourth \"expansion team\" — Kubasaki Warriors (gold & white) — was added due to the large post-Vietnam student population and to give those prep athletes an opportunity to play.\n\nFor regional games against opponents on mainland Japan, an \"all-star\" team of top players from all three (and later, four) Kubasaki varsity squads were selected and sported the green and white uniforms of the Kubasaki Dragons.\n\nThe legacy teams were dissolved with the opening of Kubasaki's new \"cross-town rivals,\" Kadena High School on Kadena Air Base in 1981.\n\nKubasaki has the Varsity Dragons and the JV Dragons. At the beginning of the season, these teams are not formed. Instead, they make up the Green Squad and White Squad, and they have scrimmages against themselves.\n\nThe Kubasaki All-Stars lost the first \"Cherry Bowl\" game 30-0 in Yamato Japan (1961) to the Narimasu Dragons; coincidentally, this game was held on the 20th anniversary of Pearl Harbor.\n\nThey split two games with Kanto Plains champion Yokota High School in the 1970s.\n\nFrom 1982 to 2004, Kubasaki and Kadena High School fielded two teams each to make up the four-team Okinawa Secondary Schools Athletic Association (OSSAA) football league. In 23 seasons, the Kubasaki Samurai won or shared 15 island championships, while the Kubasaki Shogun captured three.\n\nAt the end of the season, a Dragons varsity team was selected from the Samurai and Shogun and played against Kadena's varsity team. In 1992, the Dragons swept Kadena two games to none and routed Yokota 44-12 in the inaugural Ichiban Bowl.\n\nThe Kubasaki Dragons won the First Class AA Far East Championship against the Seoul American Falcons 34-14 in 2005, but lost to the Kadena Panthers 2 years in a row in the OAC best two-of-three series 28-14, 14-8 the first year and 45-0, 41-6 in the second.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on September 20, 2005 and became Disturbed's second consecutive number 1 debut on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States, shipping around 239,000 copies in its opening week. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA and was also the band's second number 1 release in New Zealand. It is also the first Disturbed album to not have the Parental Advisory label.\n\n\"Ten Thousand Fists\" marks the first album with bassist John Moyer who replaced Steve Kmak following his dismissal in 2003. However, Moyer was considered a session musician during the time of recording, and only became a full-time member during the tour supporting the album. It would be the band's third and final collaboration with mainstay producer Johnny K. In addition, \"Ten Thousand Fists\" is also the first album to feature their now-infamous mascot \"The Guy\" on the cover; he would later appear full-bodied in the music video for the band's \"Land of Confusion\" cover.\n\n\"Ten Thousand Fists\" is, as of 2010, Disturbed's second highest selling album in the United States, with sales of around 1.9 million copies. \"The Sickness\", the band's debut CD, has shifted sales of almost 4.2 million copies in the United States. The album was dedicated to Dimebag Darrell, who was murdered the year before the album's release.\n\nThe album features several styles, including alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock, and speed metal.\n\nOn June 16, 2005 the album title was announced via the Disturbed website. Later that month, the album track listing was also revealed. The song \"Guarded\" was released to radio stations in late June 2005 as a teaser. Vocalist David Draiman said the motive behind releasing the song was to promote the album. He said, \"[The song] was put out there to just whet everybody's appetite. It's one of the more aggressive tracks on the record, just to remind everybody where we came from and who we are.\"\n\nThe first single, \"Stricken\", was released on July 25, 2005. On August 19, 2005 the music video \"Stricken\", directed by Nathan Cox, was posted on the Warner Bros. Records website. The music video was filmed in an abandoned hospital, in the same location where some scenes from the 1984 horror film \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" were filmed. In early August 2005, viral marketing was used to promote \"Ten Thousand Fists\". A piece of software was sent via e-mail to certain recipients, who passed it along to other recipients. When the software was passed along to at least 250,000 recipients, it unlocked the song \"Ten Thousand Fists\". In early July 2006, the third single, \"Land of Confusion\" (originally written by Genesis), was released, alongside an animated music video directed by Todd McFarlane.\n\nVocalist David Draiman said that \"Ten Thousand Fists\" \"seems to fuse the brutality and darkness of \"The Sickness\" with the added melodic nature and complexity of \"Believe\". It's more aggressive than the last record, and at times, more aggressive than the first one.\" The song \"Overburdened\" is about soldiers going to Hell. Draiman said that the song \"Guarded\" is about Draiman guarding himself from other people. He said the song \"reflects what choosing this life forces certain people to do in a certain way — you have to remain guarded on a certain level.\" Draiman said the song \"Ten Thousand Fists\" is meant to \"[signify] strength, unity, conviction, power, and the exhilaration that you feel when you get to see that at one of our shows.\" Draiman continued to say, \"It's one of my favorite moments, and people know that I have an affinity for asking people to put their fists in the air, and it's just, it's exhilaration to be able to see ten thousand raised fists or more.\"\n\nAccording to band members, while \"Ten Thousand Fists\" was not written as a political album, it was their most political record to date. Vocalist David Draiman's lyrics for the title song, \"Ten Thousand Fists\", were heavily influenced by his feelings towards American president George W. Bush, and several of the songs included war/anti-war themes, including \"Deify\", for which the intro features audio clips of Bush urging the nation to push forward in war, interlaced with an individual's political commentary, while the video for \"Land of Confusion\" depicts big business and capitalism as being a corrupting Nazi-style enemy being overthrown by an army of the people led by The Guy, the band's mascot.\n\n\"Ten Thousand Fists\" earned mixed reviews from critics; it received a score of 59% on the review-aggregating website Metacritic, based on seven reviews. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus gave the album a positive review; however, regarding the album's sound, he stated \"\"Ten Thousand Fists\" does start to sound the same after a while.\" The Village Voice's reviewer Phil Freeman also gave the album a positive review, \"The guitarist and drummer are an airtight team, and the session bassist capably underpins the guitar solos that are a welcome new addition to the band's sound. Program out the cover of 'Land of Confusion' and you've got the best mainstream metal release since Judas Priest's \"Angel of Retribution\".\" \"NME\" gave it a 1/10 review describing it as \"unfocused rage\" and \"you'll find nothing more despicable this year\".\n\nThe UK and Tour editions of the album both featured four bonus tracks: \"Monster\", \"Two Worlds\", \"Hell\", and \"Sickened\", the first of which was also included as an iTunes bonus track. All four songs are also included in the band's b-side compilation, \"The Lost Children\".\n\nDisturbed\n\nSession member\n\nProduction\n"}

As a result, it became the top selling manga magazine in Japan of its period, appearing popular amongst many otaku. But the position was later occupied by \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\", when this competitor was born in 1968, knocking Shonen Magazine off the top spot. \"Shōnen Jump\" had now begun to circulate and dominate the manga magazine market. This began from the 1970s and continued throughout the 1990s, largely owed to Akira Toriyama's \"Dragon Ball\". In the middle of the 1990s, \"Shōnen Jump\" suffered the loss of \"Dragon Ball\", as the franchise had come to an end in 1996, and thus lost much of its readership. \"Shōnen Magazine\" had now made a comeback in October 1997, regaining its original position as the top selling manga magazine of its day until this was brokered in 2002. Currently, the two magazines have competed closely in terms of market circulation. Sales of the two magazines now remain very close. Circulation has dropped below two million. In a rare event due to the closeness of the two magazine's founding dates, Weekly Shōnen Magazine and Weekly Shōnen Sunday released a special combined issue on March 19, 2008. In addition, other commemorative events, merchandise, and manga crossovers were planned for the following year as part of the celebrations.\nOthers include Shōnen Magazine, published by Kobunsha of the same Kodansha group.

Morissette recorded the album with Leslie Howe, who also produced her second album \"Now Is the Time\" (1992), and it was certified platinum.\n\nJohn Alexander, head of A&R for MCA Records Canada, first heard a demo tape from Morissette in 1983, when she was nine years old. He called it \"very promising. Her voice was very strong, and it was remarkable that the tape included some original songs written by her at that age.\" However, he decided not to sign her to a record deal because \"from an A&R standpoint, I said, 'What am I going to do with a nine-year-old?'\" In 1987 Morissette met entertainment manager Stephan Klovan, and at the 1988 World Figure Skating Championships she recorded a well-received version of \"O Canada\" with two musicians, one of whom was Leslie Howe of the new wave/synthpop duo One to One. Klovan intended for Howe to work with Morissette so that she could audition on the television show \"Star Search\", but eventually both he and Howe decided to try to secure a record contract for her. She did appear on Star Search in 1990, having auditioned more than once.\n\nOne of the demo recordings Howe and Morissette created with keyboardist Serge Côté in the studio was \"Walk Away\", for which Howe and Klovan funded an expensive promotional video that was filmed in Paris, France. In 1988 Howe sent the video to Alexander, who later arranged a dinner meeting with Morissette. \"I could tell that she was a very focused and passionate 14-year-old girl, who was also very talented\", Alexander said. \"I felt strongly that we could work together to build her music career.\" The next day he met Morissette and her parents and told them he wanted to sign her, but MCA Records did not endorse this decision. Leeds Levy, president of MCA Publishing in North America, thought that Morissette had talent and agreed to sign her to a publishing deal as well as help fund a record deal for her. MCA Publishing financed the album through Hot Mustard Records, its new independent label for the development of new artists, and MCA Records distributed it. The album was recorded in Distortion Studios, Ottawa between September and December 1990.\n\nAccording to Morissette, people from MCA placed \"hardcore\" pressure on her to lose weight in time for the album's release, leading her to develop anorexia nervosa and bulimia. She subsequently began therapy, which she called \"a long process to un-program [my brain]. I try to remember, whatever my body is, it's perfect the way it is.\" She also revealed she would often go straight from school to the studios where she would stay until 3 or 4 AM and write/record music, drink alcohol, smoke marijuana, and hang out with what she called \"the older crowd\".\n\n\"Alanis\" was released in April 1991 to mixed reviews, and the media drew comparisons between Morissette and other teen pop singers at the time such as Debbie Gibson and Tiffany. Its first single, \"Too Hot\", reached number 14 on the Canadian singles chart and, in July, peaked within the top ten on contemporary hit radio. CBC called the song \"Paula Abdul-inspired\", and the \"Arizona Daily Wildcat\" described it as \"cheesy\" and \"poppy\". \"Feel Your Love\" was released as a single during this period, and the CRIA certified the album gold. \"Alanis\" reached number 25 on the Canadian album chart, and two other singles were released: \"Walk Away\", the video for which featured Matt LeBlanc, and \"Plastic\". At the 1992 Juno Awards \"Too Hot\" received nominations for \"Single of the Year\" and \"Best Dance Recording\" (for the \"Hott Shot\" remix), and Morissette won the award for \"Most Promising Female Vocalist\". The album went on to sell over 200,000 copies, though Morissette's popularity experienced a backlash at her high school, where her version of \"O Canada\" was played over the PA system every morning.\n\n\"TIME\" magazine said the album \"brought [Morissette] modest renown ... (one presumes) among people [in Canada] who don't read lyric sheets\", while \"Rolling Stone\" described it as \"vaguely Madonna-esque dance-pop\" and \"fairly generic\". \"The Kansas City Star\" labelled it \"a faux Janet Jackson album\", and \"Spin\" magazine wrote, \"It's as if her high school yearbook picture came to life and made an album designed to haunt her forever. Sometimes cheese is Velveeta.\" In 1995 Morissette released her international debut album \"Jagged Little Pill\" through U.S. label Maverick Records. Executives at Maverick persuaded MCA Records to withdraw all copies of \"Alanis\" and \"Now Is the Time\" from circulation, and they did not mention either album in the promotional material for \"Jagged Little Pill\". According to \"Spin\", Morissette's transformation from \"the Debbie Gibson of Canada\" to an alternative rock musician made some Canadians skeptical. As of 2008 \"Alanis\" is officially out of print, but some pirates and mp3s have circulated.\n\nMorissette said of \"Alanis\" and \"Now Is the Time\", \"...I'm not scared people might hear these records. I never did \"Playboy\" centrefolds. There's nothing I regret. Maybe people will just understand that my lyrics are from different experiences if they hear those records. It validates [\"Jagged Little Pill\"] ... There was an element of me not being who I really was at the time and I'm now more experienced with my life. It was because I wasn't prepared to open up that way. The focus for me then was entertaining people and getting my feet wet in the business, it was about being young & having fun as opposed to sharing any revelations I had at the time. I had them, but I wasn't prepared or comfortable with sharing it.\" She considered including material from both albums on her 2005 compilation \"\", but she was talked out of it and decided against it, citing the genres dance/pop wouldn't match other material from her current discography, also \"it was right around when I was 19 and \"Jagged Little Pill\" where I first felt writing was a channelled experience. That has a lot to do with where I was at then, with having met Glen Ballard, with my moving from Canada and moving away from any preconceived notions of how songs 'should' be written. It was the beginning of a new way to approach songwriting altogether.\"\n\n"}

Her work has been published, screened, and exhibited around the world in galleries and museums in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berlin, and Sydney.\n\nCarland was born in Portland, Maine in 1965. She grew up with 4 siblings and was raised by her single mother. She was the first in her family to graduate from high school.\n\nIn the late 1980s, while she was studying photography at The Evergreen State College, Carland co-founded the independent art gallery Reko Muse (a.k.a. wreck-o-muse) in Olympia, Washington with fellow photography student, Kathleen Hanna and another friend, Heidi Arbogast. They formed a band, Amy Carter, who performed during art exhibitions. Kathleen Hanna often did spoken word performances at the gallery. Local band, Nirvana, led by Kurt Cobain, periodically played benefit shows to support the gallery.\n\nAfter Amy Carter broke up, Carland remained friends with Hanna. She collaborated on the record art for Hanna’s band, Bikini Kill. Carland is also the namesake of the Bikini Kill song \"For Tammy Rae\" off the album Pussy Whipped. She also collaborated on album art for bands such as The Fakes and The Butchies.\n\nHanna contributed to Carland’s next project, the independently produced fanzine, I (heart) Amy Carter. Other contributors included Donna Dresch of the queercore band, Team Dresch. Carland’s zine writings have been republished in \"A Girl's Guide to Taking Over the World\" edited by Karen Green and Tristan Taormino and \"The Riot Grrrl Collection\" edited by Lisa Darms.\n\nAfter the zine's demise, Carland turned her focus to photography and filmmaking. Excerpts from her film \"Lady Outlaws and Faggot Wannabes\" are included in the documentary film \"She's Real, Worse Than Queer\" by Lucy Thane, and Carland is also interviewed in this film. She has also been a contributor to \"Joanie4Jackie\", a film compilation zine created by Miranda July, which featured \"Dear Mom\" and \"Becky 1977\" in the first and second issues respectively. Her videos \"Live From Somewhere\", \"Odd Girl Out\", and \"Lady Outlaws and Faggot Wannabes\" have screened nationally and internationally.\n\nFrom 1997-2005, Carland ran, in partnership, Mr. Lady Records and Videos. Mr. Lady was an independent record label and video distribution company dedicated to promoting feminist and queer culture. Mr. Lady released recordings by The Butchies, Kaia Wilson (Carland's ex-partner and Mr. Lady co-founder), and Le Tigre.\n\nCarland's photographs appear in the book \"The Passionate Camera: Photography and Bodies of Desire\" edited by Deborah Bright and \"Lesbian Art in America\" edited by Harmony Hammond. Carland has several bodies of work that have been shown in museums and galleries. She is currently represented by Jessica Silverman Gallery.\n\nCarland has described herself as a maker rather than a documentarian, with regard to her art practice. In general, her photographs are carefully staged rather than captured in the moment. She has cited Bernd and Hilla Becher, Felix Gonzales-Torres and Imogen Cunningham as influences, especially on her \"Lesbian Beds\" series. The series contains photographs of her friends' unmade beds, all taken from the same aerial perspective, just minutes after being vacated. In the series \"Horror Girls\", Carland dresses up to recreate scenes and characters from horror movies. In \"On Becoming: Billy and Katie 1964\" Carland creates snapshot portraits of her dressed as her parents. \"Photoback\" is a series in which she photographed found photos that have captions hand written on the backs. \"Keeping House\" is a series Carland did with Kaia Wilson, staging scene from their home life together. The series \"Post Partum Portraits\" was created after Carland became a mother.

The isthmus is crossed by the St. Peters Canal which is almost exclusively used by pleasure boats in recent decades.\n\nIt is home to Battery Provincial Park. This park is situated on a hillside overlooking St. Peter’s Bay adjacent to the St. Peter’s Canal National Historic Site. Its entrance is on the east side of the bridge at the canal. Battery features a small saltwater beach (unsupervised), an interpretive display, picnic area with ocean frontage, and 3 kilometres /1.8 miles of hiking trails. \n\nSt. Peter's is also located on Trunk 4, one of the province's trunk or secondary highways. An expressway, Highway 104, is scheduled to be extended from its present terminus several kilometres west of St. Peter's to Sydney. When this occurs, Highway 104 will carry the Trans-Canada Highway designation on Cape Breton Island, for which Highway 105 is now designated. \n\nThe Nicholas Denys Museum is located in the village, but is only open in the summer. St. Peter's used to be served by a Canadian National Railways branch line which was abandoned in the early 1980s.\n\nSt. Peter's is one of North America's oldest European establishments. Prior to the arrival of the French, it was a Portuguese trading and fishing post named Santo Pedro in the 16th century. It was abandoned by Portugal in the early 17th century, and taken over by France in the 1630s when a small fortified settlement named Saint-Pierre (again named for Saint Peter) was built by merchants from La Rochelle, France on the isthmus. In 1650, La Rochelle merchant Nicholas Denys took possession of Saint-Pierre and encouraged the fur trade with local members of the Mi'kmaq Nation who used the isthmus as a canoe portage route between the Atlantic Ocean and Bras d'Or Lake. In addition to establishing a fur trading post, Denys later used the isthmus as a \"haulover road\" for portaging small sailing ships from Bras d'Or Lake to the Atlantic and vice versa.\n\nIn 1653, along with raiding Pentagouet (Castine, Maine), LaHave, Nova Scotia, and Nipisguit (Bathurst, New Brunswick), Emmanuel Le Borgne with 100 men also raided Saint-Pierre. Denys was taken prisoner and returned to France.\n\nNicolas Denys was here between 1650–1669 and then Cape Breton remained unsettled by Europeans until the establishment of Louisbourg and re-establishment of Fort Dauphin (Englishtown, Nova Scotia) and Saint Peters 1713-1758.\n\nFrance lost possession of present-day peninsular (mainland) Nova Scotia to Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. France began moving some Acadian colonists to Île Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island) to populate this remaining outpost of French Acadia. Port Toulouse—named after Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse—was created by Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville near the 17th-century location of the fortified community of Saint-Pierre as a logistics base and supply centre for the Fortress of Louisbourg. To protect Port Toulouse, Rouville built another fortification on the shore called Point Jérome. A colonial military officer of New France, Rouville is best known in North America for leading the raid on Deerfield, Province of Massachusetts Bay on 29 February 1704 and was widely reviled by the settlers of New England for his tactics of raiding poorly defended settlements.\n\nAlong with Saint-Pierre, the French also established Fort St. Anne at present-day Englishtown as the other garrison on Île Royal to support the Fortress of Louisbourg.\n\nDuring King George's War, just prior to the Siege of Louisbourg (1745), the village was attacked in the Siege of Port Toulouse.\n\nIn August 1752 during Father Le Loutre's War, the schooners \"Friendship\" of Halifax and \"Dolphin\" of New England were seized and 21 prisoners held for ransom by Mi'kmaq at St. Peter's.\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, after the final Siege of Louisbourg (1758), the forts at Port Toulouse and the settlements in the area were destroyed by the British and the rest of Île Royale became a British colony.\n\nAfter Louisbourg fell on 26 July 1758, French officer Boishébert withdrew, with the British in pursuit. Boishebert brought back a large number of Acadians from the region around Port Toulouse to the security of his post at Beaubears Island on the Miramichi River. (On 13 August 1758 French officer Boishebert left Miramichi, New Brunswick with 400 soldiers, including Acadians from Port Toulouse, for Fort St. George (Thomaston, Maine). His detachment reached there on 9 September but was caught in an ambush and had to withdraw. They then went on to raid Friendship, Maine, where people were killed and others taken prisoner. This was Boishébert’s last Acadian expedition. From there, Boishebert and the Acadians went to Quebec and fought in the Battle of Quebec (1759).)\n\nAfter the war, Britain sponsored settlers and displaced veterans from the Seven Years' War to move into the area of Port Toulouse.\n\nFrance declared war on Great Britain on 1 February 1793 during the French Revolutionary Wars. In response, Britain built Fort Dorchester on the summit of Mount Granville, a hill overlooking the isthmus.\n\nThe village of St. Peter's was founded early in the 1800s. Local residents rehabilitated Denys's old \"haulover road\", laying wood skids for portaging small sailing ships across the isthmus. The route through Bras d'Or Lake was considered a much shorter and safer voyage to Sydney than travelling around the exposed southern coast of Cape Breton Island. In 1825 a feasibility study into building a canal was undertaken. Construction of the St. Peters Canal began in 1854 and took 15 years of digging, blasting and drilling through a solid granite hill to build a channel with an average width of 30 m (100 ft). The canal opened in 1869 at the dawn of the industrial age on Cape Breton Island. There can be a tidal difference of up to 1.4 m (4.5 ft), thus a double-lock system was designed to regulate water levels. The lock is the only one of its kind in North America.\n\nThe walls of the canal were lined with timber planking and locks were installed at each end. Modifications to the canal and lock continued until 1917 and the canal saw moderate to heavy use by small coastal steamships and barges, particularly during the First and Second World Wars when coal from the Sydney Coal Field was transported on this sheltered inland route to avoid U-boats. A marble quarry on the western shore of Bras d'Or Lake at Marble Mountain also generated some shipping traffic.\n\nThe canal was designated a National Historic Site in 1929 and the federal government took over its operation. Parks Canada is the government agency responsible for its maintenance and operation and undertook a major project to restore both entrances to the canal in 1985. During the post-war, commercial shipping has largely avoided traveling through Bras d'Or Lake and the canal is almost exclusively used by pleasure boats, particularly sailboats with the increased popularity of cruising Bras d'Or Lake in recent decades.\n\nParks Canada operates the canal from May to October each year. Vessels transiting the canal are limited by the size of the lock, which measures , , and . The ruins of Nicholas Denys's Fort Saint-Pierre are located on the grounds of the lockmaster's house (ca. 1876), and the ruins of Fort Dorchester are located on Mount Granville, which overlooks the Atlantic approach to the canal.\n\nSt. Peters contains two National Historic Sites:\n\nThe 1876 Lockmaster's House beside the canal is a Recognized Federal Heritage Building, while the circa 1870 MacAskill House, the birthplace of photographer Wallace MacAskill, is a Provincially Registered Property. The Fort Toulouse Archaeological Site is protected under the provincial Special Places Protection Act.\n\n\n"}

The company was founded in October 1998 by Akihiro Hino after he departed from the now defunct Riverhillsoft. Early in its history, the company enjoyed a close relationship with Sony Computer Entertainment, with many of its games then funded by and produced in conjunction with them. Starting in 2007, the company started self-publishing its games in Japan, while Nintendo took over publishing on their systems internationally. The company is best known for their \"Dark Cloud\", \"Professor Layton\", \"Inazuma Eleven\", \"Ni no Kuni\", \"Yo-kai Watch\", and \"Snack World\" franchises, among others.\n\nLevel-5 was established in October 1998 by Akihiro Hino and his development team at Riverhillsoft, following the release of \"OverBlood 2\". Since Hino did not originally believe that his team could become an independent developer, he formed a partnership with Sony Computer Entertainment, who would allow him to develop for their upcoming PlayStation 2 under the condition that he set up his own company. The name, \"Level-5\", was a reference to Japanese school report cards, where \"Level-5\" is the highest possible mark. Soon after being created, the company had eleven employees.\n\nLevel-5's first full-scale production was the action role-playing game \"Dark Cloud\", developed under contract by Sony Computer Entertainment. Intended to be a launch game for the Japanese release of the PlayStation 2, it was delayed before the console's launch in March 2000 to allow further development, eventually being released in Japan in December 2000, and worldwide in 2001. Work immediately began on a sequel titled \"Dark Chronicle\" (\"Dark Cloud 2\" in North America). While not as successful as the first game, \"Dark Chronicle\" still gained critical acclaim and sold over half a million units worldwide.\n\nMidway through 2002, the company had a substantial boost in recognition as it began development on three high-profile games:\n\nIn just four years, Level-5 went from small startup studio to one of the premier RPG developers in Japan, and have since enjoyed immense critical and commercial success. In early 2007, the company released its first fully self-funded and self-published game in Japan, \"Professor Layton and the Curious Village\", which has since enjoyed incredible commercial success, shipping more than 840,000 copies to retail, and has officially transitioned Level-5 into both a developer \"and\" publisher of interactive video game entertainment in Japan.\n\nYasumi Matsuno, director of \"Vagrant Story\", \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", and the \"Ogre Battle\" series, briefly joined Level-5 in June 2011, who left the company after completing work on \"Crimson Shroud\" for the Nintendo 3DS. By the early 2010s, Level-5 was one of the ten largest video game companies in Japan, holding a market share of 3.2%. In October 2015, Level-5 founded a spin-off company in Santa Monica, in cooperation with Dentsu, called Level-5 abby. Its purpose is to develop multimedia entertainment for Western demographics.\n\nIn 2009, Level-5 launched its Roid (Revolutionary Original Ideas Discovery) service, a mobile phone application that serves as a content delivery platform for mobile games. It is only compatible with NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile internet service in Japan. Users pay a monthly fee for access to exclusive games and social game functions. The platform debuted with six games: \"Sloan and McHale's Mystery Story\", \"Professor Layton and the Mansion of the Mirror of Death Remix\", \"Chara Jo P\", \"Yuuenchi wo Tsukurō Revolution\", \"Treasure Island\", and \"Elf the Dragon\". The first three were developed by Level-5, while the last three were developed by outside companies.\n\n\"All games were developed and/or published by Level-5 unless otherwise noted\"\n"}

{"id": "2076863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076863", "title": "Custom car", "text": "Custom car\n\nA custom car is a passenger vehicle that has been either substantially altered to improve its performance, often by altering or replacing the engine and transmission; made into a personal \"styling\" statement, using paint work and aftermarket accessories to make the car look unlike any car as delivered from the factory; or some combination of both. A desire among some automotive enthusiasts in the United States is to push \"styling and performance a step beyond the showroom floor - to truly craft an automobile of one's own.\" A custom car in British according to \"Collins English Dictionary\" is built to the buyer's own specifications.\n\nAlthough the two are related, custom cars are distinct from hot rods. The extent of this difference has been the subject of debate among customizers and rodders for decades. Additionally, a street rod can be considered a custom.\n\nCustom cars are not to be confused with coachbuilt automobiles, historically rolling chassis fitted with luxury bodywork by specialty body builders.\n\nA development of hot rodding, the change in name corresponded to the change in the design of the cars being modified. The first hot rods were pre-World War II cars, with running boards and simple fenders over the wheels. Early model cars (1929 to 1934) were modified by removing the running boards and either removing the fenders entirely or replacing them with light cycle fenders. Later models usually had fender skirts installed. The \"gow job\" morphed into the hot rod in the early to middle 1950s. Typical of builds from before World War II were 1935 Ford wire wheels.\n\nMany cars were \"hopped up\" with engine modifications such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and dual exhausts. Engine swaps were often done, with the objective of placing the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination. The suspension was usually altered, initially by lowering the rear end as much as possible using lowering blocks on the rear springs. Later cars were given a rake job by either adding a dropped front axle or heating front coil springs to make the front end of the car much lower than the rear. Immediately postwar, most rods would change from mechanical to hydraulic (\"juice\") brakes and from bulb to sealed-beam headlights.\n\nThe mid-1950s and early 1960s custom Deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the flatty, introduced in 1939); a Halibrand quick-change rearend was also typical, and an Edelbrock intake manifold or Harman and Collins ignition magneto would not be uncommon. Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today. Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro, Vic Edelbrock, and Offenhauser. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a \"slingshot\" design for the flatty. Front suspension hairpins were adapted from sprint cars, such as the Kurtis Krafts. The first Jimmy supercharger on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.\n\nMuch later, rods and customs swapped the old solid rear axle for an independent rear, often from Jaguar. Sometimes the grille of one make of car replaced another; the 1937 Buick grille was often used on a Ford. In the 1950s and 1960s, the grille swap of choice was the 1953 DeSoto. The original hot rods were plainly painted like the Model A Fords from which they had been built up, and only slowly begun to take on colors, and eventually fancy orange-yellow flamed hoods or \"candy-like\" deep acrylic finishes in the various colors.\n\nWith the change in automobile design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, tremendous automotive advertising raised public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Thus, custom cars came into existence, swapping headlamp rings, grilles, bumpers, chrome side strips, and taillights as well as frenching and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding lead to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term lead sled; Bondo has since largely replaced lead.) Chopping made the roof lower while sectioning made the body thinner from top to bottom. Channeling was cutting notches in the floorpan where the body touches the frame to lower the whole body. Fins were often added from other cars, or made up from sheet steel. In the custom car culture, someone who merely changed the appearance without also substantially improving the performance was looked down upon. \"Juxtapoz Magazine\", founded by the artist Robert Williams, has covered Kustom Kulture art.\n\nCustom cars are distinct from cars in stock condition. Builders may adopt the visual and performance characteristics of some relevant modification styles, and combine these as desired. There are now several different custom themes, including:\n\nPaint was an important concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic undercoat, and metalflake paint, with aluminum glitter within candy-apple paint, appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect – which in hot climates had a tendency to flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California.\n\nCustomizers also continued the habit of adding decorative paint after the main coat was finished, of flames extending rearward from the front wheels, scallops, and hand-painted pinstripes of a contrasting color. The base color, most often a single coat, would be expected to be of a simpler paint. Flame jobs later spread to the hood, encompassing the entire front end, and have progressed from traditional reds and yellows to blues and greens and body-color \"ghost\" flames. One particular style of flames, called \"crab claw flames\", which is still prevalent today, is attributed to Dean Jeffries.\n\nPainting has become such a part of the custom car scene that now in many custom car competitions, awards for custom paint are as highly sought after as awards for the cars themselves.\n\nEngine swaps have always been commonplace. Once, the Ford flathead V8 engine was the preference, supplanted by the early hemi in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, the small-block Chevy was the most common option, and since the 1980s, the Chevy has been almost ubiquitous. The Chevrolet LS has begun replacing the 350. Flatheads and early hemis have not entirely disappeared, but ready availability, ease of maintenance, and low cost of parts make the Chevrolet V8, in particular the first and third generation small block, the most frequent engine of choice.\n\nOnce customizing post-war cars caught on, some of the practices were extended to pre-war cars, which would have been called fendered rods, with more body work done on them. An alternate rule for disambiguation developed: hot rods had the engine behind the front suspension, while customs had the engine over the front suspension. The clearest example of this is Fords prior to 1949 had Henry Ford's old transverse front suspension, while 1949 models had a more modern suspension with the engine moved forward. However, an American museum has what could be the first true custom, built by Cletus Clobes in 1932, among its exhibits. With the coming of the muscle car, and further to the high-performance luxury car, customization declined. One place where it persisted was the U.S. Southwest, where lowriders were built similar in concept to the earlier customs, but of post-1950s cars.\n\nAs the supply of usable antique steel bodies has decreased, companies such Westcott's, Harwood, Gibbon Fiberglass<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\">\"Street Rodder\", 2/78, p. 43.</ref> and Speedway Motors have begun to fabricate new fiberglass copies, while Classic Manufacturing and Supply, for one example, has been making a variety of new steel bodies since the 1970s. California's \"junker\" (or \"crusher\") law, which pays a nominal sum to take \"gross polluters\" off the road, has been criticized by enthusiasts (and by SEMA) for accelerating this trend. Starting in the 1950s, it became popular among customizers to display their vehicles at drive-in restaurants, such as Johnie's Broiler in Downey, California. The practice continues in Southern California.\n\nExamples of notable customizers include George Barris, Vini Bergeman, Bill Cushenberry, the Alexander Brothers, Gil Ayala, Darryl Starbird,<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\">\"Street Rodder\", 1/85, p.56.</ref> Roy Brizio, Troy Trepanier (of Rad Rides by Troy), Boyd Coddington, Darryl Hollenbeck (working out of at Vintage Color Studios; winner of the 2016 America's Most Beautiful Roadster (AMBR) trophy with a custom Deuce) Harry Westergaard, Dave Stuckey, Dean Jeffries, Barry Lobeck, Phil Cool (who won the 1978 AMBR trophy with a bright orange Deuce, cover car for the July 1978 issue of \"Hot Rod\"), Troy Ladd of Hollywood Hot Rods, Doane Spencer (builder of a 1940s Deuce considered the template for the hiboy), \"Posie\", Ron Clark and Bob Kaiser (of Clarkaiser Customs), Joe Bailon (inventor of candy apple paint), Gene Winfield, Rick Dore Joe Wilhelm, \"Magoo\", Chip Foose, and Pete Chapouris.\n\nOthers, such as Von Dutch, are best known as custom painters. Several customizers have become famous beyond the automobile community, including Barris, Jeffries, and Coddington, thanks to their proximity to Hollywood; Barris designed TV's Batmobile, while Chapouris built the flamed '34 three-window coupé in the eponymous telefilm \"The California Kid\". Another Barris creation, \"Ala Kart\" (a '29 Ford Model A roadster pickup), made numerous appearances in film (usually in the background of diner scenes and such), after taking two AMBR wins in a row. Some customizers have become well-enough known to be referred to by given name alone. These include Boyd (Coddington), Pete (Chapouris), and Jake (Jim Jacobs).\n\nThe highest award for customizers is the AMBR (America's Most Beautiful Roadster) trophy, presented annually at the Grand National Roadster Show since 1948 (also known within the customizer community as the Oakland Roadster Show until it was moved to Southern California in 2003). This competition has produced famous, and radical, customs.\n\nAnother is the Ridler Award, presented at the Detroit Autorama since 1964 in honor of show promoter Don Ridler. With one of the most unusual of car show entry requirements, winners of the prestigious Ridler Award are selected as the most outstanding from among cars being shown for the first time. This prompts builders of many high-end roadsters to first enter the Autorama first and then the Grand National show in order to have the chance to win top honors at both shows. Few cars and owners can claim this achievement.\n\nSome customs gained attention for winning the AMBR trophy, or for their outlandish styling. Notable among these is \"Silhouette\" and Ed Roth's \"Mysterion\". Some of these more unusual projects turned into Hot Wheels cars, among them \"The Red Baron\".\n\nOther custom cars became notable for appearances in film (such as \"Ala Kart\" {1958}, \"The California Kid\" three-window {1973}, or the yellow deuce from \"American Graffiti\" {1973}) or television (such as \"The Monkeemobile\", the \"Munsters\" hearse, or, more recently, Boyd's full-custom \"Tool Time\" '34, or Don Thelan's '33 three-window, \"Eliminator\", built for the ZZ Top video). Specialist vehicles, such as the T/A, KITT, from \"Knight Rider\", are not usually considered customs, but movie or TV cars, because they retain a mostly stock exterior.\n\nStill others exemplified a trend. One of these is the '51 Merc built by the Barris brothers for Bob Hirohata in 1953, known forever after as the Hirohata Merc. Even without an appearance in film (\"Runnin' Wild\"), it is iconic of 1950s customs, and of how to do a Merc right. The same year, Neil Emory and Clayton Jensen of Valley Custom Shop built \"Polynesian\" for Jack Stewart, starting with a '50 Holiday 88 sedan. \"Polynesian\" made the cover of \"Hot Rod\" in August, and saw 54 pages of construction details in \"Motor Trend Custom Car Annual\" in 1954.\n\nCertain linguistic conventions are followed among rodders and customizers:\nThe \"cutoff year\" as originally promoted by the \"National Street Rod Association\" (NSRA) is 1949. Many custom car shows will only accept 1948 and earlier models as entries, and many custom car organizations will not admit later model cars or trucks (also with some imports - this has been a gray area of what's acceptable e.g. an aircooled VW Beetle, a Big Three product manufactured overseas e.g. a Ford Capri built in the UK or a General Motors - Holden's product, not to mention captives), and/or a vintage import automobile with an American driveline transplant but this practice is subject to change. Modern day custom car shows which allow the inclusion of muscle cars have used the 1972 model year as the cutoff since it is considered the end of the muscle car era prior to the introduction of the catalytic converter. The NSRA has announced that starting in 2011 it will switch to a shifting year method where any owner with a car 30 years or older will be allowed membership. So in 2011 the owner of a 1981 model year vehicle will qualify, then in 2012 the owner of a 1982 model year vehicle will quality, and so on. Additionally, the Goodguys car show organization has moved the year limit for its \"rod\" shows from 1949 to 1954 in recent years.\n\n\nSome other common terms:\nSome terms have an additional, different meaning among hot rodders than among customizers: NOS, for instance, is a reference to nitrous oxide, rather than new old stock.\n"}

It was her final album for MCA Records Canada. Morissette recorded the album with Leslie Howe, who produced her debut album, \"Alanis\" (1991).\n\nIn 1995 Morissette released her Grammy winning-international acclaimed debut album \"Jagged Little Pill\" through U.S. label Maverick Records. Executives at Maverick persuaded MCA Records to withdraw all copies of \"Alanis\" and \"Now Is the Time\" from circulation, and they did not mention either album in the promotional material for \"Jagged Little Pill\". According to \"Spin\" magazine, Morissette's transformation from \"the Debbie Gibson of Canada\" to an alternative rock musician made some Canadians skeptical. As with \"Alanis\", \"Now Is the Time\" is no longer in print. Morissette's contract with MCA expired after the release of the album, and she said \"It was kind of a blessing that it was over, because I wanted to start out with a clean slate, not only personally but career-wise, too.\" \"Time\" magazine called the album \"uninspired\", and the song \"Rain\" \"wistful\", while \"The Kansas City Star\" labelled it \"a lightweight faux Madonna album\".\n\nMorissette said of \"Alanis\" and \"Now Is the Time\", \"...I'm not scared people might hear these records. I never did \"Playboy\" centerfolds. There's nothing I regret. Maybe people will just understand that my lyrics are from different experiences if they hear those records. It validates [\"Jagged Little Pill\"] ... There was an element of me not being who I really was at the time and now I'm more experienced with my life.

Mic-O-Say's ceremonies, customs, and traditions are loosely based on the folklore of the American Indian. Both councils use both the Tribe of Mic-O-Say and the Order of the Arrow.\n\nMic-O-Say was founded in 1925 at \"Camp Brinton\" near Agency, Missouri under the guidance of H. Roe Bartle, who was the Scout executive of the St. Joseph Council, now Pony Express Council. Bartle combined his experiences in Wyoming with the St. Joseph Council's existing honor organization called \"Manhawka\".\n\nBartle was inspired to create the organization after serving as the Scout Executive for the Cheyenne Council of the Boy Scouts of America in Casper, Wyoming, in 1922. Bartle became interested in the heritage and culture of the many Indian reservations in Wyoming. He spent many hours listening to stories about the Indian tribes and soon began to incorporate Indian values and ideals into his Scouting program. Bartle was inducted into a local tribe of Arapaho based on a reservation served by the Scout council, and according to traditional Mic-O-Say legend, was given the name Lone Bear by the Chief.\n\nBartle started as Scout Executive in St. Joseph, January 1925. The idea of Mic-O-Say was well formed from the moment he arrived. There already existed a camp society there called Manhawka, established by a previous executive. Bartle familiarized himself with the rudiments of it, and incorporated them into his central theme of an Indian-like society based on the principles of the Scout Oath. Bartle named the society \"Micosay.\" A hyphenated version was used shortly after and remains popular today, though the non-hyphenated version can still be used.\n\nCamp Geiger, which succeeded Camp Brinton in 1935, is considered the 'mother' Tribe of Mic-O-Say. Bartle was \"The Chief,\" and conducted all the early ceremonies personally, placing an eagle claw around the neck of each new member and bestowing their Tribal Name upon them. He built up the tribe during the next few years.\n\nIn the fall of 1928, Bartle became the Scout executive of the Kansas City Area Council. Mic-O-Say had increased both Scouting and summer camp attendance in leaps and bounds, and he established another Mic-O-Say program at Camp Dan Sayre near Noel, Missouri, in 1929, the first summer there. Another honor program known as the 4Ms existed there at the time. In 1930 Camp Osceola opened near Osceola, Missouri, and remains open to this day, renamed the H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation, or commonly known as \"Bartle.\"\n\nThe tribe flourished and expanded rapidly at both Camps. The mother tribe in St. Joseph remained and grew. In 2014 the 20,000th tribesman was inducted into the Camp Geiger tribe.\n\nThe 75th anniversary celebration of the program at the H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation included thousands of members of the Tribe, including the current and previous Chief Scout Executives.\n\nThe purpose of Mic-O-Say is to reinforce the principles of the Scout Oath and Law, and to encourage continued participation in Scouting. Mic-O-Say Membership is conferred upon Scouts who participate in long-term camping and who best exemplify progress in their leadership skills. \n\nIn the Heart of America Council, the Council of Chieftains, She-She-Be Council, and Tribal Council lead the tribe. Their official publications are the \"Customs and Traditions\" booklet, \"Cedar Smoke\" newsletter, and \"Inner Circle\" magazines.\nIn the Pony Express Council, the Council of Chieftains and the Tribal Council lead the tribe. Their official publications are the \"Redbook\" and most recently \"Make Talk Now\" which is an electronic video version of the former \"Make Talk\" magazine and available for viewing on the Mic-O-Say website.\n\nThere are only 2 ranks in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say:\nThe following are \"responsibilities\", known as \"paint stations\" at Camps Geiger and Bartle, for those tribesmen who have obtained the rank of Warrior and given additional years of service to Scouting. Note that the first 5 are only for Hard-way warriors. Only a youth can advance to hard-way warrior.\n\n **** denotes Bartle only paint stations\n\nMembers of Mic-O-Say have spread nationally and internationally. Roy Williams, who served as Chief Scout Executive from 2000 to 2007, has been inducted into the program. Robert Mazzuca, who served as the Chief Scout Executive from 2007 to 2012, was inducted into the Tribe in July 2008. Michael B. Surbaugh was also inducted into the Tribe as an Honorary Chief in 2016. Two of the founders of Cerner, an international health care IT company and the current CEO of J. E. Dunn Construction Group, one of the nation's largest construction companies, are members of the program. Former U.S. Congressman from Missouri's 4th congressional district former Chair of the House Armed Services Committee Ike Skelton is a Mic-O-Say member, and was made an honorary chieftain in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2076883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076883", "title": "South East Queensland", "text": "South East Queensland\n\n</ref>\nSouth East Queensland (SEQ) is a bio-geographical, political, and administrative region of the state of Queensland in Australia, which contains more than 3.6 million people out of the state's population of 5.1 million. The area covered by South East Queensland varies, depending on the definition of the region, though it tends to include Queensland's three largest cities: the capital city Brisbane; the Gold Coast; and the Sunshine Coast. Its most common use is for political purposes, and covers and incorporates 11 local government areas, extending from Noosa in the north to the Gold Coast and New South Wales border in the south (some sources include Tweed Heads (NSW) which is contiguous as an urban area with Brisbane/Gold Coast), and west to Toowoomba (which is simultaneously considered part of the Darling Downs region).\n\nSouth East Queensland was the first part of Queensland to be settled and explored by Europeans. Settlements initially arose in the Brisbane and Ipswich areas with activity by European immigrants spreading in all directions from there. Various industries such as timber cutting and agriculture quickly developed at locations around the region from the 1840s onwards. Transport links have been shaped by the range of terrains found in South East Queensland.\n\nThe economy of South East Queensland supports and relies on a wide diversity of agricultural manufacturing industries, commerce and tourism. The region has an integrated public transport system, TransLink.\n\nSouth East Queensland, classified as an interim Australian bioregion, comprises and includes the Moreton Basin, South Burnett, and the Scenic Rim along with ten other biogeographic subregions. The term South East Queensland has no equivalent political representation. The area covers many lower house seats at the federal and state levels. As Queensland has no upper house, there are no Legislative Council provinces or regions to bear the name either.\n\nSouth East Queensland was home to around 20,000 Aboriginals prior to British occupation. The local tribes of the area were the Yugarapul of the Central Brisbane area; the Yugambeh people whose traditional lands ranged from South of the Logan River, down to the Tweed River and west to the McPherson Ranges; the Quandamooka people whose traditional lands encompassed the Moreton Bay Islands to the mouth of the Brisbane River to Tingalpa and south to the Logan River; and the Gubbi Gubbi people whose traditional lands were known to exist north of the Pine River, to Burrum River in the north, and west to the Conondale ranges. According to history researchers the Aboriginal population declined to around 10,000 over the next 60 years.\n\nEarly explorers in the area including Matthew Flinders, Allan Cunningham, John Oxley and Patrick Logan. Around 1839, European settlers were able to move into the region. Logging was the first industry to develop. The first railway built in Queensland linked Grandchester to Ipswich in 1865 along a narrow 1067 mm gauge.\n\nMajor floods were experienced in 1893, 1974 and 2011. In 2005, the region suffered its worst drought in recorded history.\n\nQueensland's third highest peak, Mount Barney, is located in the south of the region. The Cunningham Highway passes southwest to the Darling Downs via Cunninghams Gap. Several highways including the Bruce Highway, Warrego Highway and the Pacific Motorway link to the adjoining regions.\n\nThe region is mountainous. McPherson Range, Teviot Range, D'Aguilar Range, Little Liverpool Range, Blackall Range as well as the Springbrook Plateau and Tamborine Mountain Plateau. Isolated volcanic peaks are found at Moogerah Peaks and the Glass House Mountains. Along the coast are several large islands including Bribie Island, Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island with many smaller islands in Moreton Bay. Several major water supply and flood mitigation dams have been constructed here. The Western Corridor Recycled Water Scheme and Gold Coast Desalination Plant were recently built to counter the effects of drought in South East Queensland.\n\nSouth East Queensland generally consists of the following regions, each of which is also a local government area (LGA):\n\n\nThe Tweed Shire is actually within NSW but is often included in planning processes for SEQ. While not officially part of the TransLink public transport network, Surfside Buses run a seamless service across the border that appears to passengers as though it is integrated.\n\nA highly effective integrated ticketing system for public transport has averted transport gridlock in the region.\n\nThe region is a complex, regional hybrid linking Brisbane with several surrounding cities. South East Queensland includes the following regional cities:\n\nNew urban centres are currently being develop at Springfield, Ecco Ripley, Yarrabilba and Flagstone. Some geographers suggest several more master-planned communities will be needed to cater for the expected population growth rates.\n\n\nThe region exports a number of crop products including broccoli, onion, Chinese cabbage, sweet corn and celery. A sizeable vegetable industry is established in the Lockyer Valley. Timber cutting, mining and a range of agricultural pursuits including dairying were once prominent in South East Queensland. Tourism, in part due to Brisbane serving as major transport and export hub and destinations such as the Gold Coast and the availability of land for industry, has grown in recent decades together with specialised skills in professional services and manufacturing.\n\nAs of 2014, the population of South East Queensland is estimated to be approximately 3.4 million, meaning that between one in six and one in seven Australians call the region home. The regional population is heavily urbanised and concentrated along the coast. The three largest population centres of Brisbane, Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast account for 90 per cent of the region's population.\n\nSouth East Queensland is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. Growth in the state is fueled principally by migration from the southern states and overseas. In 2010, South East Queensland's population grew by an average of about 1,200 new residents each week.\n\nThe region has experienced significant population growth over the last two decades, growing on average by 55,000 to 80,000 people a year since 1986. South East Queensland is expected to be home to 4.4 million by 2031. A 2010 report concluded that the region will reach 5.5 million people by 2051.\n\nSouth East Queensland's future development will be heavily based on the South East Queensland Regional Plan, released by the Queensland state government in 2005. The regional plan covers the period from 2009–2031 and focuses on slowing development along the coast, in order to prevent creating a 200 km city, and instead aim for growth in the west, in particular around Springfield and Beaudesert. Infrastructure planning in South East Queensland is almost exclusively designed to facilitate trans-metropolitan travel and reduce traffic congestion.\n\nPredominantly rural landscapes lie to the west of the urbanised coastal centres. The Lockyer Valley, a major agricultural area referred to as \"South East Queensland's Salad Bowl\", lies outside Brisbane. Many World Heritage listed rainforests are located along the region's southern border ranges, an area known as the Scenic Rim, such as Lamington National Park and Main Range National Park.\n\nWithin the region, the koala is listed as vulnerable. The Australian Koala Foundation says the animal is threatened by mining and land development. Numbers in Redland City have seen a dramatic decline in recent years. The state government launched the Koala Conservation Plan in 2006. The plan involved the rehabilitation of cleared areas, domestic dogs containment and koala signage. Another initiative was launched in 2010 to protect and rehabilitate koala habitats by tree planting and the construction of koala friendly fencing.\n\nAfter many years of water restrictions due to severe drought, the Government of Queensland lifted restrictions across the whole of South East Queensland on 1 January 2013.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2076899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076899", "title": "St. Peters Canal", "text": "St. Peters Canal\n\nThe St. Peters Canal is a small shipping canal located in eastern Canada on Cape Breton Island. It crosses an isthmus in the village of St. Peter's, Nova Scotia which connects St. Peters Inlet of Bras d'Or Lake to the north with St. Peters Bay of the Atlantic Ocean to the south.\n\nIn the vast majority of canals the flow of water is unidirectional. That is, the \"high\" side of the canal is always the same. St. Peter's Canal is unusual in that, due to the difference in the timing of the tides between Bras d'Or Lake and the ocean, during part of the tide cycle the Atlantic side is the higher, in other parts of the tide cycle it is the lake side. As a result, the canal requires special \"double\" gates, the only ones of their kind in North America. The usual canal lock has a gate at each end, each gate consisting of two swinging doors that when closed form a shallow 'V' shape, with the point of the 'V' pointing upstream. At the St. Peter's Canal lock each gate consists of four swinging doors which form a diamond shape when closed. In actual use the pair of doors which form the upstream pointing 'V' are used. No matter which side has the higher water level, either one pair or the other will be appropriate.\n\nVessels transiting the canal are limited by the size of the lock, which measures long, wide, draught and air draught of . A swing bridge over the canal has of clearance when closed and is operated from the bridge house on Denys Street.\n\nSt. Peters Canal is the only working canal of national historic significance in Atlantic Canada and an important historic landmark for the Village of St. Peter's and for Cape Breton Island. St. Peters Canal is part of a nationwide family of over 900 national historic sites, including 9 operating canals.\n\nPrior to 2013, the canal operated from November 1 to mid-May, weather permitting, on a 24 hours' advance notice requirement.\nIt operated seven days a week, from mid-May to mid-October each year, continuing with five-day-a-week operation (Monday to Friday) from mid-October to October 31. Through the early peak season (mid-June to mid-August) the canal was open for navigation from 8:00 am to 8:30 pm each day. The remainder of the peak season (mid-August to Labour Day) the hours were 8:00 am to 7:30 pm.\n\nIn 2013 season Parks Canada reduced service to three days a week from May 17 to Jun 23, expanding to seven days a week operation from June 24 to September 8 and two days a week operation from September 9 to 22 (extended to October 14, 2013). The daily hours of operation were also cut back, with closure at 6:00 pm each day until August 11 when the closing time fell back to 4:00 pm. St. Peter's Canal handles about 1,000 transits a year. By its own estimate, Parks Canada believed 15 per cent of those boaters would be affected by the reduced hours of operation. In December 2015 seven-day-a-week operation was restored to the May 10 to June 26, 2016 operation period.\n\nHours of Operation - 2019\n\nMay 10 to June 25, 2019\n8 a.m. - 4 p.m.\nThursday - Monday\n\nJune 26 to August 10, 2019\n8 a.m. - 6 p.m.\n\nAugust 11 to September 10, 2019\n8 a.m. - 4 p.m.\n\nSeptember 11 to September 24, 2019\n8 a.m. - 4 p.m.\nThursday - Monday\n\nSeptember 25, 2019 and after\nLimited passage\nWeekdays\n902-535-2118\n\nSchedule may be subject to change.

A \"haulover road\" across the isthmus established by French fur trader Nicholas Denys in 1650 predated the canal.\n\nA feasibility study was conducted in 1825 into the possibility of building a canal. Construction began in 1854 and was completed in 1869, resulting in a channel measuring 800 m (2,600 ft) long and an average of 30 m (100 ft) wide. The canal passes through a 20 m (66 ft) high hill composed of solid granite, accounting for the 15 years for its construction. There can be a tidal difference of up to 1.4 m (4.5 ft) between Bras d'Or Lake and the Atlantic Ocean, thus a lock was designed to regulate water levels. The original works were designed to take vessels of 4 m (13 ft) draft but were deepened to 5.5 m (18 ft) between 1875 and 1881.\n\nThe St. Peters Canal saw relatively heavy use by commercial shipping in the 19th century and early 20th century, during an era of industrial expansion on Cape Breton Island.\nAdditions and renovations, widening the channel and lengthening the locks, continued until 1917. The canal eventually became too small for modern ships and has been used primarily by pleasure boats since the end of the Second World War. The canal continues to serve both pleasure craft and commercial vessels travelling to and from the Bras d’Or Lakes, with about 1000 lockages recorded for the years 2003 and 2004. The canal was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1929 and was under the jurisdiction of the Federal Department of Railways and Canals and its successor, Transport Canada up to 1972, when administration of the canal and associated property was transferred to Parks Canada who continue to operate and maintain the site today. The Lockmaster's house built in 1876 is a “recognized” heritage building according to the Federal Heritage Building Review Office (FHBRO).\n\nParks Canada undertook a major project to restore both entrances to the canal in 1985. The St. Peters Canal is operational from May to October each year. The current swing bridge, installed in its present location in 1931, is the fourth bridge to span the canal; previous ones were installed in 1869, 1876 and 1919.\n\nThe old one-lane swing bridge was constructed in 1936. The bridge was almost 80 years old and was nearing the end of its lifecycle. Routine inspections identified the bridge as needing some upgrades to meet current standards. Parks Canada considered continuing to perform repairs but a full bridge replacement was deemed to be more cost effective. The old bridge still met all safety requirements, and underwent regular bridge inspections to ensure public safety until it was replaced.\n\nIn August 2014 Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) issued a Notice of Preferred Procurement (NPP) for the design phase of a new swing bridge for the St. Peters Canal. According to Parks Canada external relations officer Maria O’Hearn, this step was the first in a three-year process that saw construction of a new two-lane swing bridge begin in 2016, with the new structure replacing the former one-lane bridge a year later. On 20 November 2014 this tender was awarded to PARSONS INC. of Gloucester, Ontario.\n\nThe project was estimated to cost $10 million (final cost closer to $16 million) and was overseen by Parks Canada as the bridge is part of a national historic site. The new two-lane bridge was built adjacent to the existing one-lane structure. Contracts for the construction went out during the winter of 2016-2017 with the work beginning in March 2017. The new two lane bridge opened slightly behind schedule to boat and vehicular traffic in mid-June 2017, with landscaping work to be completed during the summer that year. An official re-opening ceremony, with representatives of the Government of Canada, along with community members from St. Peter's and Potlotek First Nation, was held on November 16, 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "2076901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076901", "title": "American Apparel", "text": "American Apparel\n\nAmerican Apparel Inc. is an online-only retailer and former brick-and-mortar stores operator based in Los Angeles, California. Founded by Canadian businessman Dov Charney in 1989, it was a vertically integrated company that ranked as one of the largest apparel manufacturers and marketers in North America.\n\nAfter losing money for six consecutive years, American Apparel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. on October 5, 2015 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. It was reported that the brand then agreed to a plan with its creditors to convert $200 million of debt into equity, $90 million in debtor financing and $70 million in new capital. The company officially exited bankruptcy after its financial restructuring plan was accepted by the Bankruptcy Court in Delaware and became privately owned by its creditors and bond holders, thus severing ties with all former stockholders as well as ex-CEO and founder Dov Charney. In January 2017, Gildan Activewear purchased American Apparel's intellectual property and other assets for $88 million in a bankruptcy auction after the company filed for bankruptcy a second time in November 2016.\n\nIn January 2017, American Apparel laid off 2,400 Southern California workers and started the process of shutting down company factories and closing its 110 stores, using Chapter 7-like tactics.\n\nAs of mid-2017, American Apparel runs as an online-only retailer and markets itself as \"Ethically Made—Sweatshop Free,\" with the majority of its products being made internationally. Most of its apparel is sourced from factories in Central America, primarily Honduras and Nicaragua.\n\nIn January 2018, the company had an executive board consisting entirely of women. \n\nAmerican Apparel was founded in 1989 by Canadian Dov Charney.\n\nIn 1997, after a variety of iterations, including a period of manufacturing in South Carolina, the company moved to Los Angeles. Charney began to sub-contract sewing with Sam Lim who, at the time, had a shop with 50 workers under the Interstate 10 freeway in east LA. Months later the two became partners. In 2000 American Apparel moved into its current factory in downtown Los Angeles where it continued to grow primarily as a wholesale business, selling blank T-shirts to screenprinters, uniform companies and fashion brands. After its experience as a wholesale brand, the company moved into the retail market. The company was ranked 308th in Inc.'s 2005 list of the 500 fastest growing companies in the United States, with a 440% three-year growth and revenues in 2005 of over US$211 million.\nIn late 2006, American Apparel went through a reverse merger and became listed on the American Stock Exchange.\n\nIt is also one of the few clothing companies exporting \"Made in the USA\" goods and in 2007 sold about $125 million of domestically manufactured clothing outside of America. The company promotes labor policies that exclude use of clothing manufactured in sweatshops.\n\nIn 2010, American Apparel's auditors, Deloitte & Touche, resigned after informing the company that its financial statements for 2009 may not be reliable. The resignation led to investigation by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn April 2011, American Apparel confirmed that it had secured $14.9 million in financing from a group of Canadian investors. Under the deal announced, American Apparel sold some 15.8 million shares of common stock at 90 cents a share to a group of investors led by Michael Serruya and Delavaco Capital. The investors also received warrants to buy as much as 27.4 million additional shares.\n\nIn April 2013, American Apparel issued a private offering of $206 million in senior secured notes. The proceeds were used to repay a long-standing, high-interest credit facility from Lion Capital and Crystal Financial.\n\nIn June 2014, the Board of Directors decided to oust American Apparel founder, chairman and CEO, Dov Charney, after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour towards employees. As interim chief executive during the search for a permanent CEO, the company's CFO John Luttrell was appointed. As co-chairmen the company appointed Allan Mayer and David Danziger. Charney, through his lawyers, claimed his ousting was illegal and demanded reinstatement. Soon after, Lion Capital demanded the repayment of a $10 million loan four years early. A failure to repay the loan would trigger a default on a $50 million credit line with Capital One Financial.\n\nIn December 2014, American Apparel announced the official termination of CEO Dov Charney and the promotion of fashion executive Paula Schneider to that position.\n\nAs of September 2015, American Apparel was trying hard to avoid bankruptcy as it scrambled to raise money to pay down US$15.4 million debt due in October, 2015. It was struggling to find funds as it prepared to report a torrid set of financial results in the coming weeks.\n\nThe clothes retailer warned investors in August 2015 that it would not have enough cash to \"sustain operations for the next twelve months\" which raises \"substantial doubt that we may be able to continue as a going concern\". The firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 5, 2015. In January 2016, the brand rejected a $300 million takeover bid from Hagan Capital Group and Silver Creek. The investment firms are supporters of Dov Charney.\nMontreal-based company Gildan Activewear Inc. bought American Apparel but not its physical stores.\n\nAmerican Apparel designs, creates and prints its own advertisements. The company is known for its provocative and controversial advertising campaigns, which is largely the inspiration of the company CEO Dov Charney. According to Adage, American Apparel's advertising 'telegraphs the brand' from person to person. Their print campaigns are widely considered to be some of the best in the industry. The sexually charged advertising has been criticized, but has also been lauded for honesty and lack of airbrushing.\n\nAccording to CEO Dov Charney, the vision for the brand is that of a \"heritage brand. It's like liberty, property, pursuit of happiness for every man worldwide. That's my America.\" In regards to the company's image overseas, advisor Harry Parnass stated that the brand is about aspiration and that they are \"selling the American dream.\"\n\nAmerican Apparel images often display subjects with their blemishes, imperfections and asymmetrical features highlighted and attached with brief, personal descriptions. Many of the models in American Apparel's advertising are recruited by Charney and his colleagues on the street, or company stores; others are selected after sending their photos directly to the company website.\n\nThe company has also used pornographic actors and glamour models in some of its ads including Lauren Phoenix, Charlotte Stokely, Sasha Grey, Euguenia Diyordiychuk and Faye Reagan. Adult entertainment trade magazine Adult Video News cited the American Apparel website as \"one of the finer softcore websites going\". Some of the company's other ads, which feature nudity or sexual themes, have been banned by various advertising authorities. In 2009, an American Apparel ad which appeared in VICE Magazine was banned in the UK, because the image \"could be seen to sexualise a model who appears to be a child\". American Apparel complied with this ruling. American Apparel also came under fire for a 2014 ad for mini-skirts, which featured a model bending over so that her underwear was prominently exposed. In 2013, the company released an ad in which the model lay on a bed with her feet up in the air without wearing pants. The company also released an ad in which a model posed in a series of photos focused on her crotch, in which her face was not seen. The UK Advertising Standards Authority criticized the ad for being \"voyeuristic\" and \"vulnerable\".\n\nFor a time, Charney used a branding strategy that spotlighted his treatment of workers, promoting American Apparel's goods as \"sweatshop free\". In 2014, the company released a controversial ad with a topless model, and the words \"Made in Bangladesh\" across her chest, in an effort to draw attention to the company's fair labor practices. In 2008, the company took out a series of political ads featuring the corporate logo that called current immigration laws an \"apartheid system\".\n\nIn 2005, the company was named \"Marketer of the Year\" at the first-ever LA Fashion Awards. \"Women's Wear Daily\" published a survey in April 2007 from Outlaw Consulting, a creative research firm tracking the habits of 21- to 27-year-olds, which ranked American Apparel as the 8th most trusted brand, ahead of such clothing brands as H&M and Levi's.\n\nIn 2007, Imp Kerr created a fake American Apparel ad campaign in New York. The stunt lasted almost a year, until it was revealed that the fake ads were actually Photoshop mockups. American Apparel ran a tribute ad on the back cover of Vice magazine showing a compilation of the fake ads.\n\nIn January 2008, the Intelligence Group, a trend and market research firm, listed American Apparel as their number two Top Trendsetting Brand, behind only Nike. In 2008, The Guardian named American Apparel \"Label of the Year\".\n\nFrom 2009 until 2014, photographers such as Henrik Purienne and David Shama worked on a number of ad campaigns for American Apparel that defined the identity of the brand.\n\nIn 2007, American Apparel put up two billboards, one in New York and one in Los Angeles, featuring an image of Woody Allen's character dressed as a Rabbi from the movie \"Annie Hall\" and Yiddish text, for a period of one week. According to Charney, the billboards were a satire and allegory alluding to both the scene in the movie and the similar controversy experienced by both individuals. Allen strongly objected to this use of his image and sued the company for $10 million. Allen testified at a December 2008 deposition that he considered the company's advertising to be \"sleazy\" and \"infantile\".\n\nAlthough the company said as early as May 2008 that the billboards were meant \"strictly as social parody\", there was much debate over whether American Apparel's lawyers would use Allen's personal life, namely his affair with Soon-Yi Previn as their defense at the trial. Charney claimed that these rumors were outright false and that his speech was protected by the First Amendment. In May 2009, the case was settled by American Apparel's insurance carrier for $5 million, with the insurance company paying the bulk of the settlement. The settlement was for half of Allen's initial demand. Dov Charney said that if it had been up to him, he would have continued the case and taken it to trial.\n\nIn addition to participating in a variety of immigration protests, the company launched an advertising and advocacy campaign called \"Legalize LA\". The campaign featured advertisements in national papers like \"The New York Times\" as well as billboards, T-shirts, bus ads and posters. The company also maintains a Legalize LA portion of their website that features news articles relating to immigration reform, the brand and information on the history of the issue.\n\nAfter the passing of Prop 8 (which defines marriage in the state as one man and one woman) in California in November 2008, American Apparel launched the Legalize Gay campaign. It is similar to the Legalize LA campaign, and shirts with \"Legalize Gay\" and \"Repeal Prop 8\" printed on them in the same style as the shirts of Legalize LA are sold by the company.\n\nIn June 2012 American Apparel partnered with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in releasing a new line of T-shirts to celebrate LGBT Pride Month. Fifteen percent of the net sales of the shirts were donated to GLAAD. Isis King modeled for this line, becoming American Apparel's first openly transgender model. In the summer of 2013, American Apparel announced their desire for more \"transexy\" models.\n\nIn 2013, American Apparel was named one of TheStreet.com's \"8 Pro-Gay Companies\".\n\nIn a November 2010 ad running in Canadian alternative weeklies, the company describes itself as \"a majority-owned Canadian company, founded and operated by Dov Charney, a Montrealer\". The ad goes on to say, \"In the end, one of the important things that makes American Apparel special is its Canadian heritage.\"\n\nIn 2010, Kanye West released his album \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\". On this album, the song \"Gorgeous\" (featuring Kid Cudi and Raekwon) contained the following lyrics: \"I need more drinks and less lights, and that American Apparel girl in just tights.\"\n\nThe 2013 Capital Cities song \"Farrah Fawcett Hair\", features a verse in which André 3000 lists a number of things he appreciates, ending with \"getting tucked in every night for a month by the American Apparel ad girls\". This song became the source for a parody by Willam Belli, Courtney Act, and Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 titled \"American Apparel Ad Girls\".\n\nIn February 2014, the band 5 Seconds of Summer released their hit single \"She Looks So Perfect\", which included the following lyrics: \"You look so perfect standing there\nin my American Apparel underwear.\"\n\nThe production system of American Apparel centralizes most of its employees in a single location. By not outsourcing, Charney believes that he knows his workers better and that it ties them directly to the brand. A banner on top of the downtown factory states \"American Apparel is an Industrial Revolution.\"\n\nCharney has stated that American Apparel hires its creatives by their sense of culture and fashion, not their resume. Conversely, the company has also been accused of focusing on personal style and outward appearance in its hiring practices for retail positions.\nAccording to Charney, the unconventional corporate culture at American Apparel is responsible for the company's creativity and rapid growth. He's stated that the company is open about sexuality and its culture because \"young people like honesty.\"\n\nThe company has been criticized for its unconventional corporate culture. Charney claimed to have slept with employees, and reportedly masturbated numerous times and had oral sex performed on him by an employee during a series of interviews with a writer for the magazine \"Jane\".\n\nAmerican Apparel has been subject to seven public sexual harassment lawsuits, though to date, they have all been dismissed, \"thrown out,\" remanded to arbitration, or in one case, settled but with \"no monetary liability to the company.\" In one prominent case, the company was sued by four ex-models for sexual harassment—including one separately named plaintiff who sued the company for $250 million—in a lawsuit which involved mutual nude photographs, sexual text messages and requests for money. The company was accused of being responsible for these leaks in a later lawsuit. However, the case was dismissed by a New York City judge in 2012. In another case, American Apparel was reprimanded in an opinion by the Second Appellate District for a settlement in which plaintiff confessed that she had not been subjected to sexual harassment and American Apparel attempted to issue press release which mentioned an arbitration hearing that had, in fact, never taken place. As of 2013, only one case, a \"class action [lawsuit] on behalf of all female employees\" which contains no \"specific allegations against Charney,\" remains active. In response to the lawsuits, American Apparel has claimed that the lawsuits were extortionary attempts to \"shake the company down,\" and has run advertisements saying so. Charney has maintained his innocence in all the lawsuits, telling CNBC that \"allegations that I acted improperly at any time are completely a fiction.\" The board of directors voted to strip him of his position of chairman in June 2014 and fire him as CEO. Charney responded with legal action attempting to retain his positions.\n\nIn December 2014, Dov Charney was terminated as the company's Chief Executive Officer after months of suspension. He was replaced by Paula Schneider, president of ESP Group Ltd, company of brands like English Laundry, on January 5, 2015.\n\nAs of 2008, the company employed more than 10,000 people and operated more than 200 retail locations in 20 countries. The company paid its manufacturing employees an average of $12 per hour. According to the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" the average factory worker at the company makes $80–120 per day, or roughly $500 per week compared to the $30–40 made daily at most other Los Angeles-based garment factories. Employees also receive benefits such as paid time off, health care, company-subsidized lunches, bus passes, free English as an additional language classes, on-site massage therapists, free bicycles and on-site bike mechanics, free parking in addition to the proper lighting and ventilation. Every floor of the factory includes free telephones where workers can make and receive long distance phone calls. The company's employees in foreign countries do not receive the same hourly wages as their Los Angeles counterparts. However, employees in China will earn US Federal minimum wage. After going public, the company offered employees as much as $40 million in stock shares. The plan grants employees roughly 1 share of stock for every workday they'd spent at the company. Approximately 4,000 of the company's employees are eligible for the program. In previous years the waiting list for employment at American Apparel has had over 2,000 names on it. In 2010 the company was actively looking for staff following an investigation by US immigration found that 1,500 of its workers lacked the legal immigration documents and were subsequently dismissed.\n\n\"New York Times\" reporter Rob Walker wrote about the controversy in his book \"Buying In\" and revealed that since the unionization drive, the company Sweat X, which was held up as the example for what American Apparel should be, had since gone out of business. He quotes Charney saying more explicitly that \"[Sweat X] ... fucking failed.\"\n\nThe differences between American Apparel and Sweat X were the subject of the 2010 documentary \"No Sweat\".\n\nIn 2015, the company hired the union-busting firm Cruz & Associates. The firm was paid a total of $462,343.\n\nAs early as 2001, American Apparel has been a vocal advocate for reform of U.S. immigration laws. On May 1, 2002 American Apparel shut down its factory to allow the company's workers, many of whom are immigrants, to participate in a pro-immigration rally in downtown Los Angeles. Dov Charney, a Canadian, also marched alongside the workers. American Apparel participates annually in the May 1st Immigration March and Rally in downtown Los Angeles. In 2008, they added a route from their factory that eventually connected with other supporters near the city hall. The company's politics were eventually spun off into the Legalize LA advertising campaign.\n\nIn 2009, an ICE audit of American Apparel's employment records uncovered discrepancies in the documentation of about 25% of the company's workers, implying mainly that they were undocumented immigrants. About 1,500 workers were let go in September of that year as a result. American Apparel responded with questions of the effectiveness of such an action and said \"\"[the firings] will not help the economy, will not make us safer. No matter how we choose to define or label them [undocumented immigrants] are hard-working, taxpaying workers.\"\" The ICE audit highlighted a new strategy from President Obama which announced they were shifting away from high-profile raids. According to CEO Dov Charney, American Apparel promised its workers who were fired for improper immigration documentation that they would be given \"priority treatment, in terms of being interviewed for future positions with the company,\" if and when they \"got [their] immigration papers in order.\" Commenting on the loss of 1,500 workers due to concerns over illegal immigration Charney said \"It broke our efficiencies and generated a situation where we were late delivering garments. It lost us an enormous amount of money. It cost us agility.\"\n\nThe company depends on environmentally friendly practices and is known for its innovations in sustainability due to vertical integration. American Apparel manufacturing system is designed around the concept of \"Creative Reuse\"—which converts excess fabric from one garment template into several additional garments such as bathing suit tops, belts, headbands, bows, bras, underwear and children's clothing. This otherwise wasted material reduces the amount of fabric the company needs to produce in addition to expanding its product line and saves approximately 30,000 pounds of cotton per week.\n\nAmerican Apparel maintains a bicycle lending program for its employees and according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals it is a vegan-friendly clothing company. As of 2007 the company planned to increase its use of organic cotton within the next four years from over 20% to 80%. American Apparel also sells a line of shirts under the \"Sustainable\" label that are 100% USDA organic cotton. In 2008, American Apparel purchased over 30,000 pounds of organic cotton known as B.A.S.I.C cotton.\n\nAmerican Apparel installed a 146-kilowatt solar electric system on its factory roof, designed to reduce power costs by at least 20%. These panels power as much as 30% of the factory.\n\nIn 2005, the company hosted a bikini car wash benefit with the American Red Cross to raise money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, they packaged and delivered 80,000 shirts to the relief effort in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. As an underwriter of Farm Aid, American Apparel donates the blank shirts that the organization prints and sells as merchandise. In 2007, right before Christmas, American Apparel donated more than 300,000 articles of clothing, with the giveaway specifically targeting the homeless population of large cities. In 2009, the company had a \"Justice for Immigrants\" factory sale in Los Angeles—the proceeds of which benefitted organizations such as the Casa Libre Immigrant Children's Homeless Youth Shelter, the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, the Coalition for Humane Immigration Reform of Los Angeles, Hermandad Mexicana Latinoamericana, and the National Day Laborers Organizing Network.\n\nAmerican Apparel also donated more than $400,000 worth of garments to the victims of the Haitian earthquake through Fashion Delivers as well as over 5,000 pairs of socks to the shoe charity Soles4Souls.\n\nAmerican Apparel was criticized in October 2013 for a 'culturally insensitive display' in one of its New York stores. The display used imagery associated with Traditional African religion and Afro-American religion. This sparked outrage among some practitioners of these various religions, that include Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, West African Vodun, Cuban Santería, and others.\n\n"}

{"id": "2076912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2076912", "title": "Bill Stewart (musician)", "text": "Bill Stewart (musician)\n\nWilliam Harris Stewart (born October 18, 1966, in Des Moines, Iowa) is an American jazz drummer. He has performed with Maceo Parker, John Scofield, Joe Lovano, Michael Brecker, Pat Metheny, Lonnie Smith, Nicholas Payton, Bill Carrothers, Steve Wilson, Seamus Blake, Larry Goldings and Peter Bernstein, and Jim Hall.\n\nBill Stewart's father was a trombonist, and his first and middle names are a tribute to jazz trombonist Bill Harris.\n\nStewart grew up in Des Moines, Iowa, listening to his parents' jazz and rhythm and blues records without much exposure to live jazz in the then relatively isolated state of Iowa. The largely self-taught drummer began playing at the age of seven. While in high school, he played in a Top 40 cover band and the school orchestra, and went to a summer music camp at Stanford Jazz Workshop, where he met jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie. After high school graduation, Stewart attended the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, Iowa, playing in the jazz and marching bands as well as the orchestra. He then transferred to William Paterson University (then William Paterson College), where he played in ensembles directed by Rufus Reid, studied drums with Eliot Zigmund and Horacee Arnold and took composition lessons from Dave Samuels. The young drummer met future employer Joe Lovano while still in college (the two played duets in lieu of a drum lesson when Zigmund was away). Stewart also made his first recordings, with saxophonist Scott Kreitzer, and pianist Armen Donelian, while still in school, and with pianist Franck Amsallem (and Gary Peacock on bass) shortly thereafter, in 1990.\n\nAfter college, Stewart moved to New York where he quickly built his reputation, first gaining wider recognition in John Scofield's quartet with pianist Michael Eckroth and bassist Ben Street and in a trio with Larry Goldings and Peter Bernstein, which has become the longest-running group Stewart has played with, having begun in 1989 and continuing to this day, however infrequently the group may be found in performance. Stewart's musical horizons expanded when funk saxophonist Maceo Parker tapped the budding drummer upon seeing him with Larry Goldings at a regular gig at a club in Manhattan. Stewart worked with Parker from 1990 to 1991, touring and recording on three of Parker's albums. The association led to Stewart's gig with James Brown, who told Stewart that there \"Ain't no funk in Iowa!\" upon learning the drummer's roots. Another close associate is pianist Kevin Hays, with whom he performs, along with fellow WPC graduate, bassist Doug Weiss. The Kevin Hays trio has recorded five CDs and toured internationally. Musical associations with Lee Konitz, Michael Brecker, Pat Metheny and many other notable jazz musicians have followed.\n\nAs a drummer, Bill Stewart's playing is distinguished by its melodic focus, and its polyrhythmic, or layered character. To describe someone's drumming style as \"melodic\" would mean there is a sense that you could \"hum along\" with discernible linear phrases which tell pieces of a story, akin to a vocalist, pianist, or saxophonist. Stewart's improvisations favor the development and layering of motivic ideas over the raw generation of excitement or display of technical prowess. Stewart has great touch, or dynamic precision, so that his ideas are articulated with an exactness and clarity. He has also achieved a very high degree of independence of his limbs, so that not only the ride cymbal and the snare/toms, but also the bass drum and hi-hat, are free to participate as melodic \"first-class citizens.\" His drumming bears the influence of various melodic drummers who preceded him, including Max Roach, Art Blakey, Joe Morello, Roy Haynes, Jack DeJohnette, Paul Motian, and Al Foster.\n\nAs a composer, Bill Stewart is forward-looking, and seems not to want to repeat what others have already accomplished. In other words, his tunes have a bit of an avant-garde flavor. The melodies, harmonies, phrase lengths, and measure lengths are often altered so as not to conform too closely to traditional jazz language. Some of his tunes (such as \"Mayberry\") also feature a built-in \"free blowing\" section, surrounded by a composed \"head\" (in the case of \"Mayberry\", a parody of the theme song of the \"Andy Griffith Show\".) The concept of \"Mayberry\" may have been borrowed from Stewart's long-time collaborator John Scofield, who has written many tunes of the same general shape.\n\nStewart, for the most part, plays holding his sticks in a \"matched\" grip, favored by orchestral and rock players. This is in contrast to many jazz contemporaries who still prefer the traditional grip.\n\nStewart has a considerable output as a leader, beginning with 1989's \"Think Before You Think\", with bassist Dave Holland, pianist Marc Copland, and saxophonist Joe Lovano, on which the drummer led a session of originals and standards, including one of his own compositions.\n\nIn his next outing as a leader, Stewart assembled trumpeter Eddie Henderson, saxophonist Lovano, pianist Bill Carrothers and bassist Larry Grenadier for an entire record of Stewart compositions, \"Snide Remarks\", which was chosen as one of the top ten jazz CDs of the year by Peter Watrous of \"The New York Times\".\n\nThe second Blue Note album to be released under Stewart's name was 1997's \"Telepathy\", featuring Carrothers and Grenadier along with saxophonists Steve Wilson and Seamus Blake.\n\nIn 2005, the Bill Stewart Trio, with Kevin Hays and Larry Goldings, released \"Keynote Speakers\". The ensemble is a twist on the usual organ-guitar-drum trio, where a second keyboard (variously piano, Fender Rhodes, and other keyboard instruments) is added to the organ-drum foundation. In December 2006 he recorded \"Incandescence\" with the same trio.\n\nStewart's recordings all have a certain blend of playfulness and mystery propelled by his drumming and melodic and rhythmic compositional style. Stewart has said that he thinks it very important to find an interesting combination of musicians whose abilities will complement each other and who will sound at home on the compositions slated for the given session.\n\nStewart plays various Zildjian K cymbals and is endorsed by the Avedis Zildjian Company. A collaboration with Paul Francis from Zildjian yielded the 22\" K Custom Special Dry Complex Rides (in Thin and Medium Thin weights), which are meant to replicate the sound of an old K. Zildjian cymbal Stewart has had for a long time. They were introduced in 2004. According to Stewart, \"The K Custom Special Dry Complex Ride has some trashy quality, but can also be articulate. The nice crash sound gets out of the way quickly while a clean stick sound or click is evident when riding. These cymbals are very pretty, yet can be very nasty.\"\n\nThe cymbals were redesigned and sold as the K Custom Dry Complex II Rides since 2008 in sizes of 20, 22 and 24-inch. These custom ride cymbals feature a wider bell with a much lower profile to promote more control while offering a smooth array of rich overtones. Weight specifications are slightly heavier (medium-thin) than the first generation of Complex Rides, to make the cymbals more versatile, providing ride patterns that can be heard clearly from within an airy wash of overtones.\n\nZildjian has also designed the Bill Stewart Artist Series Drumsticks.\n\n\nWith Franck Amsallem\n\nWith Peter Bernstein\n\nWith Seamus Blake\n\nWith Bill Carrothers\n\nWith Scott Colley\n\nWith Marc Copland\n\nWith Larry Goldings\n\nWith Jon Gordon\n\nWith Lage Lund\n\nWith Pat Martino\n\nWith Pat Metheny\n\nWith Maceo Parker\n\nWith Chris Potter\n\nWith Jim Rotondi\n\nWith John Scofield\n\nWith Jesse van Ruller\n\nWith others\n\n"}

It has been represented by Democrat Jim Cooper since January 2003.\n\nThe district is located slightly northwest of the state's geographical center. It is currently composed of Davidson and Dickson counties, as well as most of Cheatham County. It is the only Tennessee congressional district which does not border another state.\n\nThe fifth district is nearly synonymous with Tennessee's capital city, Nashville, as the district has almost always been centered on Nashville throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries. The city is a center for the music, healthcare, publishing, banking and transportation industries, and is home to numerous colleges and universities (its old nickname was \"the Athens of the South\"). It is also home to the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, earning it the nickname \"Music City\".\n\nThe district stretches west of Nashville, and into Cheatham and Dickson counties, which are far less suburbanized than the communities to the south and east of Nashville.\n\nThe 5th is historically a very safe seat for the Democratic Party, due almost entirely to the influence of heavily Democratic Nashville. Some pockets of Republican influence exist in Belle Meade, and portions of neighboring Cheatham County. However, they are no match for the overwhelming Democratic trend in most of Nashville.\n\nNo Republican has represented Nashville in Congress since Horace Harrison in 1875.\n\nFollowing the 1950 census, Tennessee expanded briefly to ten districts. Even though it has since contracted back to nine districts, that marked the beginning of the continuous period where the 5th district was centered on Davidson County/Nashville.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1957, Nashville was represented by J. Percy Priest, who was the House majority whip in the 81st and 82nd Congresses. A dam in eastern Davidson County and the lake formed by the dam are both named in his memory.\n\nPriest died just before the Election of 1956, and the Democrats turned to Carlton Loser. Loser won that election, and then to two more Congresses after that. Loser appeared to win another Democratic nomination in 1962, but his primary came under investigation for voter fraud, and a court ordered a new election. In this new election, Loser was defeated by former state senator Richard Fulton.\n\nRichard \"Dick\" Fulton represented the 5th from 1963 until 1977, when retired from Congress to become the second mayor of metropolitan Nashville.\n\nFollowing the 1970 census, while Fulton was representing the district, Tennessee briefly contracted to eight congressional districts. During the 70s, the district encompassed Davidson, Cheatham, and Robertson counties. This contraction of congressional districts forced the first time in thirty years where Davidson County was not the sole county in the district. (The fifth was Davidson County and only Davidson County from 1943 to 1972.)\n\nOnce Fulton was Nashville mayor, he was succeeded in Congress by former state senator Clifford Allen. Allen served for only a term and a half (Nov.1975- Jun.1978) before he died in office due to complications from a heart attack he'd suffered a month earlier.\n\nIn the election of 1978, the fifth district selected state senator Bill Boner. He served in Congress for ten years, and then succeeded Fulton as mayor of Nashville.\n\nBoner was succeeded in 1988 by Bob Clement, former president of Cumberland University and son of former governor Frank G. Clement. Clement ended up serving seven terms as TN-District 5 Congressman, where he served Davidson and Robertson counties. He was one of the 81 Democratic congressmen who voted for the Iraq Resolution of 2002.\n\nClement did not run for re-election in 2002, as he was running for the open US Senate seat left by retiring Fred Thompson. He won the Democratic nomination easily, but was defeated in the general election by former governor Lamar Alexander. Clement was succeeded in Congress by Jim Cooper, who, like Clement, was also the son of a former governor.\n\nJim Cooper is considered a blue dog Democrat. According to On The Issues, he is deemed \"moderate\", but is slightly to the left of the political center. As of summer 2019, he is in his ninth term in Congress.\n\nSource: Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 2, 2004\n\nSource: TN Department of State\n\nSource: TN Department of State\n\nSource: \n\nSource: \n\nSource: \n\n\n"}

An international representative for Australia and Lebanon, and a New South Wales State of Origin representative goal-kicking , he played his entire club football career in Sydney with Canterbury-Bankstown with whom he won the 2004 NRL Premiership. In 2009 (his final season in the NRL) El Masri took the record for the highest-ever point scorer in premiership history and for a record sixth time was the NRL's top point scorer for the season. He also became only the seventh player in history to score over 150 NRL tries, having primarily played on the wing, but also at .\n\nEl Masri is a self-identified devout Muslim. He is widely respected for his community work with young people, winning the NRL's Ken Stephen Award in 2002. The award recognises players who contribute to the betterment of their community away from rugby league.\n\nEl Masri, widely regarded as the greatest goalkicker ever seen on a rugby league field, scored the second most points (2,418) by any player in NRL history.\n\nEl Masri was born in Tripoli, Lebanon on 1 April 1976 to ethnic Lebanese parents, Khaled and Amal. He emigrated to Australia with his family from there in 1988 when he was 12 years old. He began playing soccer at an early age but during his senior years in high school switched to rugby league, joining a local club, the Enfield Federals. While playing for Belmore Boys High School in 1994, El Masri was spotted by Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs development officers and was invited to trials for their Jersey Flegg side. The following year he was elevated to the President's Cup squad.\n\nEl Masri debuted in the Sydney Bulldogs' first grade team during the 1996 ARL season. He was not the first choice goal-kicker at the Bulldogs initially as the club still featured renowned sharp shooter Daryl Halligan. It was not until Halligan was injured in 1997 that El Masri first kicked for the club. In that year's Super League season El Masri scored a memorable hat-trick of tries against English club Halifax.\n\nEl Masri had become a regular member of the Canterbury-Bankstown squad by the 1998 NRL season. Although his side reached the 1998 NRL Grand Final, he did not play in Canterbury's defeat by the Broncos.\n\nIn 1999, El Masri made his debut for Lebanon in a Mediterranean Cup game against Morocco. In this match he scored a total of 48 points, the highest number of points ever scored by one player in an international match.\n\nThe Lebanon nation side qualified for their first ever World Cup in 2000 and El Masri captained the side. He played in all three of Lebanon's World Cup games. He played in his country's first ever World Cup Match against New Zealand, which they lost 64–0. He scored a try and kicked three goals in their 24–22 defeat by Wales. He scored two tries and kicked three goals in their 22–22 draw against the Cook Islands. At the end of the group stage, Lebanon finished on one point and did not advance to the knockout stage. At the end of the World Cup his stats were three tries and six goals for 24 points for Lebanon. His brother, Samer El Masri, also played for Lebanon. El Masri later played for the New South Wales representative side in 2001 and would go on to appear in the annual City vs Country Origin fixture on five occasions.\n\nIn 2002, El Masri topped the League's point-scoring table for the first time and rejected a $2 million offer from the South Sydney Rabbitohs, opting to stay with the Bulldogs. In 2002, he played for the Australian team against New Zealand. El Masri set a new record for most goals scored by a Bulldogs player in a single match with 11 against the South Sydney Rabbitohs in Round 21, 2003.\n\nEl Masri broke the National Rugby League point scoring record for a single season with 342 points (16 tries and 139 goals) in the 2004 season. He then played for Canterbury on the wing in their 2004 NRL grand final victory over cross-city rivals the Sydney Roosters, scoring a try and kicking two goals. As 2004 NRL premiers, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs faced Super League IX champions, Leeds, in the 2005 World Club Challenge. El Masri played on the wing, scoring two tries and kicking four goals in the Bulldogs' 32–39 loss.\n\nEl Masri set the Canterbury-Bankstown club's career points record, surpassing Daryl Halligan during the 2005 NRL season.\n\nIn 2006, El Masri broke another two club records: the most points scored for a single game (34 points, round 2 against the Wests Tigers) and the most first grade tries for Canterbury (123, Round 13 against the Newcastle Knights). He also kicked his 600th goal during that match.\n\nEl Masri broke the 1,900-point record after scoring 14 points in Round 8 of the 2007 NRL season against the Newcastle Knights, defeating them 30–16 and becoming the sixth player to ever surpass that point, along with Graham Eadie, Mick Cronin, Daryl Halligan, Jason Taylor and Andrew Johns. El Masri was called up to Game 3 of the 2007 State of Origin series to make his debut for New South Wales after Jamie Lyon was ruled out through injury. He kicked three conversions from the sideline, and scored the final try, giving him 10 points in total. Also in 2007, Bill Woods published an authorised biography, \"El Magic: the life of Hazem El Masri\".\n\nEl Masri broke the all-time highest NRL career point scoring record in front of a crowd of 19,791 against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in round 1, 2009, with a penalty goal on a rainy Saturday night, giving him 2,208 points. On 15 May 2009, El Masri played his 300th game in the Bulldogs 20–18 defeat by the Dragons at Win Jubilee Stadium. He was the first Canterbury play to reach the milestone. He joined the exclusive '300' club behind, Darren Lockyer (355), Terry Lamb (349), Steve Menzies (349), Brad Fittler (336), Cliff Lyons (332), Andrew Ettingshausen (328), Geoff Gerard (320), Jason Croker (318), Paul Langmack (315), Ruben Wiki (312), Steve Price (306), Luke Ricketson (301) and Petero Civoniceva (300). In June 2009, El Masri announced that he would retire from the NRL at the end of the 2009 season. He played his 317th and final game on 25 September 2009 against the Parramatta Eels in the preliminary final in front of a crowd of 74,549 people, the largest finals crowd ever recorded for a non-grand final. Lebanon Cedars' coach John Elias approached El Masri to play a one-off European Cup tie for Lebanon against Russia in Tripoli in October 2009. El Masri considered accepting this invitation but found himself unable to do so.\n\nWith El Masri setting the NRL career point scoring record of 2,418 points in 317 games (159 tries, 891/1087 goals at 81.97%).\n\nIn 2000, El Masri married a Saudi Arabian-born Palestinian woman, Arwa Abousamra. They have three children. \n\nEl Masri is a devout Muslim. He was one of the first Lebanese Australians to step forward in the name of friendship and understanding in the wake of the racially motivated 2005 Cronulla riots.\n\nAfter his retirement, El Masri made an appearance, kicking a goal, in the opening ceremony of Melbourne's new AAMI Park before the 2010 ANZAC Test. El Masri was approached to stand as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Lakemba at the 2011 state election. El Masri and his wife split in early 2014. He subsequently remarried. He was a White Ribbon Day ambassador. In October 2015, he was charged by New South Wales Police with assaulting his second wife and causing bodily harm. In early 2016 the charge was later dropped by police. In 2017, it was reported he and his first wife, Arwa had remarried.\n\n"}

(; August 28, 1899 – July 12, 1976), known professionally as James Wong Howe (Houghto), was a Chinese American cinematographer who worked on over 130 films. During the 1930s and 1940s, he was one of the most sought after cinematographers in Hollywood due to his innovative filming techniques. Howe was known as a master of the use of shadow and one of the first to use deep-focus cinematography, in which both foreground and distant planes remain in focus.\n\nBorn in Guangzhou, China, Howe immigrated to the United States at age five and grew up in Washington. He was a professional boxer during his teenage years, and later began his career in the film industry as an assistant to Cecil B. DeMille. Howe pioneered the use of wide-angle lenses and low-key lighting, as well as the use of the crab dolly.\n\nDespite the success of his professional life, Howe faced significant racial discrimination in his private life. He became an American citizen only after the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943, and due to anti-miscegenation laws, his marriage to a white woman was not legally recognized in the United States until 1948.\n\nHowe earned 10 nominations for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, winning twice for \"The Rose Tattoo\" (1955) and \"Hud\" (1963). He was selected as one of the 10 most influential cinematographers in a survey of the members of the International Cinematographers Guild. \n\nHowe was born Wong Tung Jim in Taishan, Canton Province, China in 1899. His father Wong Howe moved to America that year to work on the Northern Pacific Railway and in 1904 sent for his family. The Howes settled in Pasco, Washington, where they owned a general store. A Brownie camera, said to have been bought at Pasco Drug (a now-closed city landmark) when he was a child, sparked an early interest in photography.\n\nAfter his father's death, the teenaged Howe moved to Oregon to live with his uncle and briefly considered (1915–16) a career as a bantamweight boxer. After compiling a record of 5 wins, 2 losses and a draw, Howe moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in hopes of attending aviation school but ran out of money and went south to Los Angeles. Once there, Howe took several odd jobs, including work as a commercial photographer's delivery boy and as a busboy at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\nAfter a chance encounter with a former boxing colleague who was photographing a Mack Sennett short on the streets of Los Angeles, Howe approached cinematographer Alvin Wyckoff and landed a low-level job in the film lab at Famous Players-Lasky Studios. Soon thereafter he was called to the set of \"The Little American\" to act as an extra clapper boy, which brought him into contact with silent film director Cecil B. DeMille. Amused by the sight of the diminutive Asian holding the slate with a large cigar in his mouth, DeMille kept Howe on and launched his career as a camera assistant. To earn additional money, Howe took publicity stills for Hollywood stars.\n\nOne of those still photographs launched Howe's career as a cinematographer when he stumbled across a means of making silent film star Mary Miles Minter's eyes look darker by photographing her while she was looking at a dark surface. Minter requested that Howe be first cameraman, that is director of photography, on her next feature, and Howe shot Minter's closeups for \"Drums of Fate\" by placing black velvet in a large frame around the camera. Throughout his career, Howe retained a reputation for making actresses look their best through lighting alone and seldom resorted to using gauze or other diffusion over the lens to soften their features. Howe worked steadily as a cinematographer from 1923 until the end of the era of silent film.\n\nIn 1928, Howe was in China shooting backgrounds for a movie he hoped to direct. The project he was working on was never completed (although some of the footage was used in \"Shanghai Express\"), and when he returned to Hollywood, he discovered that the \"talkies\" had largely supplanted silent productions. With no experience in that medium, Howe could not find work. To reestablish himself, Howe first co-financed a Japanese-language feature shot in Southern California entitled \"Chijiku wo mawasuru chikara\" (\"The Force that Turns the Earth around its Axis\"), which he also photographed and co-directed. When that film failed to find an audience in California's nisei communities or Japan, Howe shot the low-budget feature \"Today\" for no salary. Finally, director/producer Howard Hawks, whom he had met on \"The Little American\", hired him for \"The Criminal Code\" and then director William K. Howard selected him to be the cinematographer on \"Transatlantic\".\n\nHowe's innovative work on \"Transatlantic\" reestablished him as one of the leading cinematographers in Hollywood, and he worked continuously through the 1930s and 1940s, generally on several movies per year. Howe gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be difficult to work with, often overruling and even berating other members of the film crew. In a 1945 issue of \"The Screen Writer\", Howe stated his views of a cameraman's responsibility, writing in \"The Cameraman Talks Back\" that \n\"[t]he cameraman confers with the director on: (a) the composition of shots for action, since some scenes require definite composition for their best dramatic effect, while others require the utmost fluidity, or freedom from any strict definition or stylization; (b) atmosphere; (c) the dramatic mood of the story, which they plan together from beginning to end; (d) the action of the piece.\" Howe's broad view of a cinematographer's responsibilities reflected those established for first cameramen in silent films and continued through the studio era where most directors were also contract employees mainly in charge of actor performances.\n\nHowe was nominated for an Academy Award in 1944 in the \"Best Cinematography: Black-and-White\" category for his work on the movie \"Air Force\", a nomination he shared with Elmer Dyer, A.S.C., and Charles A. Marshall.\n\nIn the early 1930s, while at MGM, Howe, who had generally been billed as \"James Howe\", began listing his name in film credits as \"James Wong Howe\". Over the course of his career, he was also credited as \"James How\", \"Jimmie Howe\", and \"James Wong How.\" Often publicized as a Chinese cameraman, Howe was prevented from becoming a U.S. citizen until the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943.\nPrior to World War II, Howe met his future wife, novelist Sanora Babb, whom he married in 1937 in Paris. Due to anti-miscegenation laws, the marriage would not be legally recognized in the United States until 1948. Babb died in 2005, aged 98.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Howe's long-term contract with Warner Bros. lapsed, and he went to China to work on a documentary about rickshaw boys. When he returned Howe found himself \"gray-listed.\" While never a Communist, Howe was named in testimony as a sympathizer. Howe and his wife Sanora Babb, who had been a member of the Communist Party, moved to Mexico for a time; Howe again had trouble finding employment until writer/director Samuel Fuller hired him to shoot \"The Baron of Arizona\".\n\nAgain reestablished, Howe's camerawork continued to be highly regarded. In 1949 he shot tests and was hired for a never made comeback film starring Greta Garbo (screen adaptation of Balzac's \"La Duchesse de Langeais\"). In 1956, Howe won his first Academy Award for \"The Rose Tattoo\". The film's director Daniel Mann originally had been a stage director and later stated that he gave Howe control over almost all decisions about the filming other than those regarding the actors and dialogue. In 1957's \"Sweet Smell of Success\", Howe worked with director Alexander Mackendrick to give the black-and-white film a sharp-edged look reminiscent of New York tabloid photography such as that taken by Arthur \"Weegee\" Fellig. During the 1950s, Howe directed his only English-language feature films, \"Invisible Avenger\", one of many film adaptations of \"The Shadow\", and \"Go Man Go\", a movie about the Harlem Globetrotters. Neither was a critical or commercial success. In 1961 Howe directed episodes of \"Checkmate\" and \"87th Precinct\", then went back to cinematography.\n\nHowe's best known work was almost entirely in black and white. His two Academy Awards both came during the period when Best Cinematography Oscars were awarded separately for color and black-and-white films. However, he successfully made the transition to color films and earned his first Academy Award nomination for a color film in 1958 for \" The Old Man and the Sea\". He won his second Academy Award for 1963's \"Hud\". His cinematography remained inventive during his later career. For instance, his use of fish-eye and wide-angle lenses in \"Seconds\" (1966) helped give an eerie tension to director John Frankenheimer's science fiction movie.\n\nDuring the mid to late 1960s, he taught cinematography at UCLA's Film School. Some of his students include Dean Cundey, Stephen H. Burum, and Alex Funke. Howe would take a minimal set and teach how to achieve a particular mood and style with just lighting. Cundey said, \"it was my most valuable class I took in film school\" and it changed his career direction to cinematography.\n\nAfter working on \"The Molly Maguires\" (1970), Howe's health began to fail, and he entered semi-retirement. In 1974, he was well enough to be selected as a replacement cinematographer for \"Funny Lady\". He collapsed during the filming; American Society of Cinematographers president Ernest Laszlo filled in for Howe while he was recovering in the hospital. \"Funny Lady\" earned Howe his tenth and final Oscar nomination. Three documentaries were made about Howe during the last two decades of his life.\n\nAssociation of Asian Pacific American Artists has given the James Wong Howe Award. Past winners of \"The Jimmy\" have included Arthur Dong, Genny Lim, and Jude Narita.\n\nHowe met his wife, a white woman named Sanora Babb, before World War II. They traveled to Paris in 1937 to marry, but their marriage was not recognized by the state of California until 1948, after the law banning interracial marriage was abolished. Due to the ban, the \"morals clause\" in Howe's studio contracts prohibited him from publicly acknowledging his marriage to Babb. They would not cohabit due to his traditional Chinese views, so they had separate apartments in the same building.\n\nDuring the early years of the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings, Babb was blacklisted due to supposedly having Communist ties from her marriage to Howe; she moved to Mexico City to protect the \"graylisted\" Howe from racial harassment.\n\nHowe raised his godson, producer and director Martin Fong after Fong arrived in the United States.\n\nHe is buried at Pierce Bros. Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles.\n\nHowe's earliest discovery was the use of black velvet to make blue eyes show up better on the orthochromatic film stock in use until the early 1920s. Orthochromatic film was \"blue blind\"; it was sensitive to blue and green light, which showed as white on the developed film. Reds and yellows were darkened. Faced with the problem of actors' eyes appearing washed out or even stark white on film, Howe developed a technique of mounting a frame swathed with black velvet around his camera so that the reflections darkened the actors' eyes enough for them to appear more natural in the developed film.\n\nHowe earned the nickname \"Low-Key Howe\" because of his penchant for dramatic lighting and deep shadows, a technique that came to be associated with film noir. Later in his career, as film-stocks became faster and more sensitive, Howe continued to experiment with his photography and lighting techniques, such as shooting one scene in \"The Molly Maguires\" solely by candlelight.\n\nHowe also was known for his use of unusual lenses, film stocks, and shooting techniques. For the 1927 film, \"The Rough Riders\", Howe created an early version of a crab dolly, a form of camera dolly with four independent wheels and a movable arm to which the camera is attached. For the boxing scenes of \"Body and Soul\" (1947), he entered the boxing ring on roller-skates, carrying an early hand-held camera. \"Picnic\" (1955) features a very early example of the helicopter shot, filmed by the second-unit cinematographer, Haskell Wexler, and planned by Wexler and Howe.\n\nHowe was the first minority cinematographer admitted to the ASC, and mentored other minority cinematographers, such as John Alonzo, who shot \"Chinatown\" and many other productions in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Alonzo credited Howe with giving him his big break on the film \"Seconds\" as a camera operator, doing hand-held sequences during the wild party scenes with Rock Hudson. Alonzo became known for his hand-held technique.\n\nHowe also shot \"The Outrage,\" a remake of \"Rashomon\". During the chase scenes through the woods, Howe had the actors run around him in a circle, which when filmed, looks like a chase. Alonzo used this technique in \"Sounder,\" in the wooded chase sequence.\n\nAlthough the innovation of deep focus cinematography is usually associated with Gregg Toland, Howe used it in his first sound film, \"Transatlantic\", 10 years before Toland used the technique in \"Citizen Kane\". For deep focus, the cinematographer narrows the aperture of the camera lens, and floods the set with light, so that elements in both the foreground and background remain in sharp focus. The technique requires highly sensitive film and was difficult to achieve with early film stocks. Along with Toland and Arthur Edeson, Howe was among the earliest cinematographers to use it successfully.\n\n"}

The estate was home to the families of Compton, de la Pole, Doddiscombe, Gilbert and Templer. The castle has been home to the Gilbert family for most of the time since it was built. Listed as a Grade 1 set of buildings, it has been a National Trust property since 1951.\n\nThe castellated house was the seat of Sir Maurice de la Pole in the reign of King Henry II (1154–1189), after which family the manor was known as Compton Pole when it came into the hands of Sir Peter Compton. The original undefended manor house was built in the mid-14th century and consisted of a hall flanked by solar and service rooms at each end. These were rebuilt in the later Middle Ages. The fortress-like front was added in about 1520 by John Gilbert. The central hall was in ruins by the 18th century, but was faithfully reconstructed in the 1950s.\n\nCompton Castle's most famous inhabitant was Sir Humphrey Gilbert.(1539–1583), coloniser of Newfoundland and half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh; legend has it that Raleigh smoked the first pipe of tobacco in Britain while visiting Sir Humphrey. The castle was home to the Gilbert family until the estate was sold in 1785 whereupon it gradually declined until a descendant bought it back in 1931; he gave it to the National Trust in 1951 on the condition that members of the family should continue to occupy the castle. They still do, and administer it for the Trust.\n\nThe great hall lacked a roof and needed a great deal of restoration work which was all done prior to the National Trust acquiring the property. In the hall there is a model of \"Squirrel\", the ship in which Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed to Newfoundland (The crest of the Gilbert family is \"A squirrel sejant on a hill vert feeding on a crop of nuts proper\"). To the west of the great hall is the solar, which served as a private retiring room away from the bustle of the great hall. It is approached by a 15th-century staircase. Another restored room is the kitchen, which is housed in a separate building because of the risk of fire it posed. To the right of the hearth, a stone stair led up inside a tower to what was probably a guard room.\n\nExternal defences in the castle included two portcullises which could be lowered when the castle came under attack. Arrows could be shot through loopholes overlooking the gateway. The curtain walls had slits through which stones and boiling oil could be dropped on any attackers trying to scale the walls.\n\nThe castle was used as a location for the filming of the 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\". Its Great Kitchen is notable for the insight it gives into medieval domestic life, and its small formal gardens are enclosed by a stone curtain wall.\n\nThere is another Compton Castle at Compton Pauncefoot, Somerset.\n\n"}

Her early films helped define the No Wave scene. According to \"The Irish Times\", \"one of the most important film-makers Ireland has produced\".\n\nDick was born in Donegal and grew up in Ireland during the 1950s, attending University College Dublin there in the 1960s. After travels in Europe, India and Mexico, she emigrated to the United States in the 1975. She relocated to London in the mid-1980s and returned to Ireland in the mid-1990s. Dick currently lives in Galway and teaches filmmaking at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.\n\nUpon her arrival in the U.S., Dick became an integral figure in No Wave film culture and produced a series of seminal Super8 short films. Living in New York, which was undergoing a recession and an inexpensive place to live, many of her films were staged around well-known sites such as Coney Island, the Statue of Liberty, and the World Trade Center. The films featured punk performers such as Lydia Lunch, Pat Place (of the band Bush Tetras) and Adele Bertei (of The Contortions). Film critic and author J. Hoberman has called Dick the \"quintessential No Wave filmmaker\".\n\nAfter leaving the United States, Dick's work took on a more political tone. She was an active member of the London Filmmakers Coop during her time in the city. Her 2014 film, \"The Irreducible Difference of the Other\", acknowledges her longstanding interest in Luce Irigaray. Her work is examined in the 2010 documentary \"Blank City\", which discusses the No Wave movement. She is referenced by the feminist dance-punk group, Le Tigre, in their song \"Hot Topic.\"\n\nDick's work formed part of two major retrospectives of American \"avant garde\" film: \"No Wave Cinema 1978-87\" (1996) at the Whitney Museum, New York and \"Big as Life: An American History of Super8 Film\" (1999) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Vivienne's work was the subject of a retrospective at the Crawford Arts Centre, curated by Treasa O'Brian in 2009, with an accompanying monograph co-published by the Crawford Arts Centre and the LUX Tate Modern, London in late 2010. It included a collection of her remarkable films and included a performance by Lydia Lunch as well as discussions with Nan Goldin, Claire Pajaczkowska and Maeve Connolly, as well as films by other artists selected by Dick.\n\n\n"}

Older Colagers mentor younger members, preparing them for challenges that a child may face having same-sex parents. Every summer COLAGE comes to Family Pride annual Family Week in Provincetown on Cape Cod. There, hundreds of gay families attend COLAGE meetings and workshops.\n\nCOLAGE is currently a virtual organization and has a small paid staff. The national program director is Kaley Fry.\n\nCOLAGE is the first organization of its kind and was originally called Just for Us. Just for Us began as a newsletter of the main six members of COLAGE. Later, six other chapters around the United States adopted that name. The ancestry of COLAGE can be tracked to an annual conference that is sponsored each year by Gay and Lesbian Parents Coalition International (GLPCI). In 1992, the group met for three days, outside of its annual meeting, to compose a mission statement and long-term goals. Amity Buxton represented the Straight Spouse Network (SSN), which has close relations with the Family Pride Coalition (FPC), at the conference and gave presentations for the GLPCI/FPC concerning her heading of the Task Force for children through the PFLAG. Her presentation proved successful in contributing to the origins of COLAGE.\n\nIn 1995, COLAGE opened a volunteer-run national office in San Francisco. This office operated for the primary purpose of providing \"support, research, media, and advocacy\" for over 500 families on a mailing list of children with GLBT parents. Beginning in 1996, COLAGE included children of transgender parents and designed specific resources not available anywhere else.\n\nIn 1997, the organization had their first director on payroll with a minuscule budget. The director, along with a determined team of youth-led volunteer committees, was able to commence a nationwide campaign that would allow them to hire another staff member in 1999.\n\nIn the United States, there are 6 million children who have at least one lesbian or gay parent and within these values anywhere from one to nine million children are currently being raised in same-sex parent households. Children within these households face minority problems and the ability to cope with their situation can often be overwhelming. COLAGE serves these types of children in several ways with peer support and community-building.\n\nThe process for children to become comfortable with their lifestyle is often disrupted by different outside influences such as the \"negative portrayals, misinformation, and the constant public debate about LGBT rights.\" Another purpose of COLAGE is advocating for the lack of legal recognition of same-sex relationships to address the burden of lack of benefits or protections for LGBT families with children. COLAGE also opposes negative media concerning the psychological disorders that surround the children of LGBT parents.\n\nThis program of COLAGE aims to \"connect constituents with media and public speaking opportunities empowering them to produce authentic representations of their experiences.\" YLAP (Youth Leadership and Action Program) was a COLAGE program designed to support public education and advocacy efforts for the children with LGBT parents by creating high quality arts activism materials. In 2005, the YLAP members completed \"In My Shoes: Stories of Youth with GLBT Parents\", a documentary that profiles several adolescents with their stories, unique experiences, and their opinions about same-sex marriages. This film is used as an educational tool to reach out to youth across America in hopes to education the general public and eventually influence school policies and legislation at the state/federal level. \"In My Shoes: Stories of Youth with LGBT Parents\" won the Audience Award for Best Short at the Frameline Film Festival and is now distributed to classrooms and communities nationwide.\n\nThis program of COLAGE aims directly \"provide tools, training, and information to engage effectively in public policy development.\" COLAGErs have been brought up by helping youth from an early age develop \"self-awareness to social awareness to civic and political advocacy.\" Specifically for this program area, a staff-led organization researches and advocates for COLAGE. In 2004, this organization \"created and distributed a state-by-state guide of issues directly affecting GLBT people and families.\" \n\n\n"}

Constructed in the 1960s, the A-35 links Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu with Montreal via the A-10. The A-35 is also the primary route for traffic between Montreal and Boston, although it ends short of the U.S. border. South of its current terminus in Saint-Sébastien, the A-35 continues as two-lane Route 133 (which becomes four-lane divided north of the border) to the border. An extension of A-35 to meet Interstate 89 at Saint-Armand will complete a nearly limited-access highway link between Montreal and Boston. It had been scheduled to open in 2017, but construction was on hold during 2015 and 2016, so this last freeway link will be delayed until at least 2020. The MTQ has not mentioned any revised schedule.\n\nLike many Quebec Autoroutes, the A-35 also has a name: Autoroute de la Vallée-des-Forts (\"Forts Valley Highway\"). The name refers to a chain of forts built by the French in the Richelieu Valley during the 17th and 18th centuries to defend their colonial settlements from the Iroquois. The A-35 used to be known as Autoroute de la Nouvelle-Angleterre (\"New England Motorway\"), referring to its role as a link between Quebec and New England.\n\nFirst constructed in the 1960s, A-35 is currently a long, 4-lane spur route linking Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu to Autoroute 10. By 1966, connecting the A-10 in Chambly with Route 104 in Iberville were opened to traffic. Another of A-35 from Route 104 to its terminus with Route 133 were completed in 1967. Completion of the entire length of A-35 had been scheduled for that year in time for Expo 67, but the province instead focused on expediting construction of autoroutes and approach roads to the Expo site. \n\nFor many years, the A-35 featured at-grade intersections with St-Raphael Road and St-Andre Road in Saint-Luc. These intersections were closed in 1999; the St-Andre Road intersection was converted into a partial cloverleaf interchange, while St-Raphael Road was dead-ended on either side of the A-35.\n\nA federal-provincial funding agreement is providing for the completion of the A-35 to Interstate 89 at the U.S. border. The project's objectives are to improve economic links between Quebec and New England, reduce traffic on Route 133 (which is ill-equipped for the traffic it currently carries) and improve quality of life in the region.\n\nConstruction of the A-35 extension began in 2009 between Saint-Alexandre and Saint-Sébastien. Construction of the extension is divided into four segments. The first section (first two segments) of new highway between Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Highway 133 to Saint-Sébastien was opened on October 8, 2014. \n\nOn June 10, 2019, Federal and provincial government officials announced that plans are in the works to extend Quebec’s Highway 35 by nearly nine kilometres in the southbound direction — but that still leaves it 4.5 kilometres short of reaching the U.S. border. Although Provincial authorities still did not know when the section will be complete, construction of this section was expected to begin in 2020.\n\nIf ever completed, the length of A-35 will increase to .\n\n"}

So, while the concentration of the solutes is fundamental to the calculation of the dynamics of a solution, they theorized that an extra factor that they termed gamma is necessary to the calculation of the activity coefficients of the solution. Hence they developed the Debye–Hückel equation and Debye–Hückel limiting law. The activity is only proportional to the concentration and is altered by a factor known as the activity coefficient formula_1. This factor takes into account the interaction energy of ions in solution.\n\nIn order to calculate the activity formula_2 of an ion C in a solution, one must know the concentration and the activity coefficient:\n\nwhere\nDividing formula_6 with formula_5 gives a dimensionless quantity.\n\nThe Debye–Hückel limiting law enables one to determine the activity coefficient of an ion in a \"dilute\" solution of known ionic strength.

Another English translation was completed in 2019 . The article deals with the calculation of properties of electrolyte solutions that are under the influence of ion-induced electric fields, thus it deals with electrostatics.\n\nIn the same year they first published this article, Debye and Hückel, hereinafter D&H, also released an article that covered their initial characterization of solutions under the influence of electric fields called \"On the Theory of Electrolytes. II. Limiting Law for Electric Conductivity\", but that subsequent article is not (yet) covered here.\n\nIn the following summary (as yet incomplete and unchecked), modern notation and terminology are used, from both chemistry and mathematics, in order to prevent confusion. Also, with a few exceptions to improve clarity, the subsections in this summary are (very) condensed versions of the same subsections of the original article.\n\nD&H note that the Guldberg–Waage formula for electrolyte species in chemical reaction equilibrium in classical form is\n\nwhere\n\nD&H say that, due to the \"mutual electrostatic forces between the ions\", it is necessary to modify the Guldberg–Waage equation by replacing formula_43 with formula_44, where formula_1 is an overall activity coefficient, not a \"special\" activity coefficient (a separate activity coefficient associated with each species)—which is what is used in modern chemistry .\n\nThe relationship between formula_1 and the special activity coefficients formula_47 is\n\nD&H use the Helmholtz and Gibbs free entropies formula_49 and formula_50 to express the effect of electrostatic forces in an electrolyte on its thermodynamic state. Specifically, they split most of the thermodynamic potentials into classical and electrostatic terms:\n\nwhere\n\nD&H give the total differential of formula_49 as\n\nwhere\n\nBy the definition of the total differential, this means that\n\nwhich are useful further on.\n\nAs stated previously, the internal energy is divided into two parts:\n\nwhere\n\nSimilarly, the Helmholtz free entropy is also divided into two parts:\n\nD&H state, without giving the logic, that\n\nIt would seem that, without some justification,\n\nWithout mentioning it specifically, D&H later give what might be the required (above) justification while arguing that formula_69, an assumption that the solvent is incompressible.\n\nThe definition of the Gibbs free entropy formula_50 is\n\nwhere formula_72 is Gibbs free energy.\n\nD&H give the total differential of formula_50 as\n\nAt this point D&H note that, for water containing 1 mole per liter of potassium chloride (nominal pressure and temperature aren't given), the electric pressure formula_75 amounts to 20 atmospheres. Furthermore, they note that this level of pressure gives a relative volume change of 0.001. Therefore, they neglect change in volume of water due to electric pressure, writing\n\nand put\n\nD&H say that, according to Planck, the classical part of the Gibbs free entropy is\n\nwhere\n\nSpecies zero is the solvent. The definition of formula_82 is as follows, where lower-case letters indicate the particle specific versions of the corresponding extensive properties:\n\nD&H don't say so, but the functional form for formula_87 may be derived from the functional dependence of the chemical potential of a component of an ideal mixture upon its mole fraction.\n\nD&H note that the internal energy formula_54 of a solution is lowered by the electrical interaction of its ions, but that this effect can't be determined by using the crystallographic approximation for distances between dissimilar atoms (the cube root of the ratio of total volume to the number of particles in the volume). This is because there is more thermal motion in a liquid solution than in a crystal. The thermal motion tends to smear out the natural lattice that would otherwise be constructed by the ions. Instead, D&H introduce the concept of an ionic atmosphere or cloud. Like the crystal lattice, each ion still attempts to surround itself with oppositely charged ions, but in a more free-form manner; at small distances away from positive ions, one is more likely to find negative ions and vice versa.\n\nElectroneutrality of a solution requires that\n\nwhere\n\nTo bring an ion of species \"i\", initially far away, to a point formula_59 within the ion cloud requires interaction energy in the amount of formula_93, where formula_11 is the elementary charge, and formula_95 is the value of the scalar electric potential field at formula_59. If electric forces were the only factor in play, the minimal-energy configuration of all the ions would be achieved in a close-packed lattice configuration. However, the ions are in thermal equilibrium with each other and are relatively free to move. Thus they obey Boltzmann statistics and form a Boltzmann distribution. All species' number densities formula_97 are altered from their bulk (overall average) values formula_98 by the corresponding Boltzmann factor formula_99, where formula_15 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_16 is the temperature. Thus at every point in the cloud\n\nNote that in the infinite temperature limit, all ions are distributed uniformly, with no regard for their electrostatic interactions.\n\nThe charge density is related to the number density:\n\nWhen combining this result for the charge density with the Poisson equation from electrostatics, a form of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation results:\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve and does not follow the principle of linear superposition for the relationship between the number of charges and the strength of the potential field. It has been solved by the Swedish mathematician Thomas Hakon Gronwall and his collaborators physicical chemists V. K. La Mer and Karl Sandved in a 1928 article from Physikalische Zeitschrift dealing with extensions to Debye–Huckel theory, which resorted to Taylor series expansion.\n\nHowever, for sufficiently low concentrations of ions, a first-order Taylor series expansion approximation for the exponential function may be used (formula_105 for formula_106) to create a linear differential equation (Hamann, Hamnett, and Vielstich. Electrochemistry. Wiley-VCH. section 2.4.2). D&H say that this approximation holds at large distances between ions, which is the same as saying that the concentration is low. Lastly, they claim without proof that the addition of more terms in the expansion has little effect on the final solution. Thus\n\nThe Poisson–Boltzmann equation is transformed to\n\nbecause the first summation is zero due to electroneutrality.\n\nFactor out the scalar potential and assign the leftovers, which are constant, to formula_109. Also, let formula_18 be the ionic strength of the solution:\n\nSo, the fundamental equation is reduced to a form of the Helmholtz equation:\n\nToday, formula_114 is called the Debye screening length. D&H recognize the importance of the parameter in their article and characterize it as a measure of the thickness of the ion atmosphere, which is an electrical double layer of the Gouy–Chapman type.\n\nThe equation may be expressed in spherical coordinates by taking formula_115 at some arbitrary ion:\n\nThe equation has the following general solution (keep in mind that formula_12 is a positive constant):\n\nwhere formula_19, formula_120, and formula_121 are undetermined constants\n\nThe electric potential is zero at infinity by definition, so formula_121 must be zero.\n\nIn the next step, D&H assume that there is a certain radius formula_123, beyond which no ions in the atmosphere may approach the (charge) center of the singled out ion. This radius may be due to the physical size of the ion itself, the sizes of the ions in the cloud, and any water molecules that surround the ions. Mathematically, they treat the singled out ion as a point charge to which one may not approach within the radius formula_123.\n\nThe potential of a point charge by itself is\n\nD&H say that the total potential inside the sphere is\n\nwhere formula_127 is a constant that represents the potential added by the ionic atmosphere. No justification for formula_127 being a constant is given. However, one can see that this is the case by considering that any spherical static charge distribution is subject to the mathematics of the shell theorem. The shell theorem says that no force is exerted on charged particles inside a sphere (of arbitrary charge). Since the ion atmosphere is assumed to be (time-averaged) spherically symmetric, with charge varying as a function of radius formula_129, it may be represented as an infinite series of concentric charge shells. Therefore, inside the radius formula_123, the ion atmosphere exerts no force. If the force is zero, then the potential is a constant (by definition).\n\nIn a combination of the continuously distributed model which gave the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and the model of the point charge, it is assumed that at the radius formula_123, there is a continuity of formula_132 and its first derivative. Thus\n\nBy the definition of electric potential energy, the potential energy associated with the singled out ion in the ion atmosphere is\n\nNotice that this only requires knowledge of the charge of the singled out ion and the potential of all the other ions.\n\nTo calculate the potential energy of the entire electrolyte solution, one must use the multiple-charge generalization for electric potential energy:\n\nThis section was created without reference to the original paper and there are some errors in it (for instance, the ionic strength is off by a factor of two). Once these are rectified, this section should probably be moved to the nondimensionalization article and then be linked from here, since the nondimensional version of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation isn't necessary to understand the D&H theory.\n\nThe differential equation is ready for solution (as stated above, the equation only holds for low concentrations):\n\nUsing the Buckingham π theorem on this problem results in the following dimensionless groups:\n\nformula_49 is called the reduced scalar electric potential field. formula_147 is called the reduced radius. The existing groups may be recombined to form two other dimensionless groups for substitution into the differential equation. The first is what could be called the square of the reduced inverse screening length, formula_148. The second could be called the reduced central ion charge, formula_149 (with a capital Z). Note that, though formula_150 is already dimensionless, without the substitution given below, the differential equation would still be dimensional.\n\nTo obtain the nondimensionalized differential equation and initial conditions, use the formula_153 groups to eliminate formula_132 in favor of formula_155, then eliminate formula_156 in favor of formula_129 while carrying out the chain rule and substituting formula_158, then eliminate formula_129 in favor of formula_147 (no chain rule needed), then eliminate formula_18 in favor of formula_148, then eliminate formula_150 in favor of formula_149. The resulting equations are as follows:\n\nFor table salt in 0.01 M solution at 25 °C, a typical value of formula_148 is 0.0005636, while a typical value of formula_149 is 7.017, highlighting the fact that, in low concentrations, formula_148 is a target for a zero order of magnitude approximation such as perturbation analysis. Unfortunately, because of the boundary condition at infinity, regular perturbation does not work. The same boundary condition prevents us from finding the exact solution to the equations. Singular perturbation may work, however.\n\nTo verify the validity of the Debye–Hückel theory, many experimental ways have been tried, measuring the activity coefficients: the problem is that we need to go towards very high dilutions.\nTypical examples are: measurements of vapour pressure, freezing point, osmotic pressure (indirect methods) and measurement of electric potential in cells (direct method).\nGoing towards high dilutions good results have been found using liquid membrane cells, it has been possible to investigate aqueous media 10 M and it has been found that for 1:1 electrolytes (as NaCl or KCl) the Debye–Hückel equation is totally correct, but for 2:2 or 3:2 electrolytes it is possible to find negative deviation from the Debye–Hückel limit law: this strange behavior can be observed only in the very dilute area, and in more concentrate regions the deviation becomes positive.\nIt is possible that Debye–Hückel equation is not able to foresee this behavior because of the linearization of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation, or maybe not: studies about this have been started only during the last years of the 20th century because before it wasn't possible to investigate the 10 M region, so it is possible that during the next years new theories will be born.\n\nWarning: The notation in this section is (currently) different from in the rest of the article.\n\nA number of approaches have been proposed to extend the validity of the law to concentration ranges as commonly encountered in chemistry\n\nOne such extended Debye–Hückel equation is given by:\n\nwhere formula_172 as its common logarithm is the activity coefficient, formula_173 is the integer charge of the ion (1 for H, 2 for Mg etc.), formula_174 is the ionic strength of the aqueous solution, and formula_175 is the size or effective diameter of the ion in angstrom. The effective hydrated radius of the ion, a is the radius of the ion and its closely bound water molecules. Large ions and less highly charged ions bind water less tightly and have smaller hydrated radii than smaller, more highly charged ions. Typical values are 3Å for ions such as H,Cl,CN, and HCOO. The effective diameter for the hydronium ion is 9Å. formula_176 and formula_177 are constants with values of respectively 0.5085 and 0.3281 at 25 °C in water .\n\nThe extended Debye–Hückel equation provides accurate results for μ ≤ 0.1. For solutions of greater ionic strengths, the Pitzer equations should be used. In these solutions the activity coefficient may actually increase with ionic strength.\n\nThe Debye–Hückel equation cannot be used in the solutions of surfactants where the presence of micelles influences on the electrochemical properties of the system (even rough judgement overestimates γ for ~50%).\n\n\n\n"}

A part of the Los Angeles Community College District, it is located on Vermont Avenue south of Santa Monica Boulevard on the former campus of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). From 1947 to 1955, the college shared its campus with California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA), then known as Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences (LASCAAS), before the university moved to its present campus of in the northeastern section of the City of Los Angeles, east of the Civic Center.\n\nThe LACC campus was originally a farm outside Los Angeles, owned by Dennis Sullivan. It is one of nine separate college campuses of the Los Angeles Community College District. When the Pacific Electric Interurban Railroad connected downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood in 1909, the area began to develop rapidly. In 1914, the LA Board of Education moved the teachers' Normal School to the site. The Italian Romanesque campus became the original campus of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1919. In need of more space, UCLA moved to its present location in Westwood in 1929. On September 9, 1929, the campus opened its doors as Los Angeles Junior College with over 1,300 students and 54 teachers. The campus changed its name to Los Angeles City College in 1938.\n\nThe California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) was founded on July 2, 1947 by an act of the California legislature and opened for classes as Los Angeles State College (LASC) on the campus of Los Angeles City College.

{"id": "2077085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077085", "title": "National Association of Personal Financial Advisors", "text": "National Association of Personal Financial Advisors\n\nNational Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is an American financial planning trade organization created in 1983 to expand the use of fee-only financial advisors by individual consumers. NAPFA established the first set of professional standards for fee-only financial advisors and has updated them to reflect changes in industry practices.\n\nNAPFA members are distinguished from other financial professionals in several ways.\n\n\nThe combination of strict fee-only rules and a peer review have kept NAPFA's membership small compared to other professional financial planning organizations. As of December 1, 2018, NAPFA had approximately 3,500 members.\n\nNAPFA defines a \"fee-only\" financial advisor as one who is compensated solely by the client, with neither the advisor nor any related party receiving compensation that is contingent on the purchase or sale of a financial product. This definition is in direct contrast to most advisors, who earn commissions, discounts, and other incentives when their clients purchase financial products. Also, unlike other financial planners, NAPFA members are required to clearly disclose the fee in advance.\n\nHowever, NAPFA members differ on how they charge the fee. Some advisors charge an hourly rate, similar to an attorney or CPA. Rates vary by region of the country and an advisor's experience level and expertise. Some advisors charge a retainer fee schedule that is paid quarterly or annually. Other advisors charge based upon a percentage of the client's assets under management, such as a 1% fee on the assets per year. Regardless, the fee must be made clear to the client.\n\nNAPFA does not permit its members to be compensated via the industry-standard 12b-1 sales & marketing expense fees for mutual funds. From NAPFA's perspective, there are two problems with these fees: undermined objectivity and inadequate disclosure.\n\n\nNAPFA's membership requirements include proof that a financial advisor can produce a comprehensive financial plan for a client. Proof is demonstrated through peer review of a financial plan submitted by the prospective NAPFA member. The plan can either be from an actual client with whom the advisor is working, or it can be a plan produced from a sample set of facts and situations developed by NAPFA to test a candidate's knowledge.\n\nThe plan must contain numerous specific elements that are common needs of many individuals and families. These include the following: a client's goals and objectives, net worth statement, cash flow analysis, recent tax return and analysis, insurance needs (medical, home, life, disability, long-term care, auto, umbrella, other), investment analysis and recommendations, retirement needs and projections, and estate plan and related elements (will, Advance health care directive, durable power of attorney, etc.).\n\nIn addition to developing standards for financial advisors and enforcing those standards, NAPFA engages in a variety of free consumer education programs. These are designed to teach consumers how to manage their financial affairs, as well as to identify when they might need the assistance and support of a fee-only financial advisor.\n\nNAPFA has always advocated on behalf of consumers' interests. In fact, protecting consumers was the impetus behind the creation of the organization—the radical idea in the early 1980s that fee-only financial planning, without high and hidden commissions, would be better for consumers.\n\nOver the years, NAPFA's influence has resulted in greater awareness and adoption of fee-only principles by leading financial advisors, other major financial industry trade associations, and government regulations. Since 2008, NAPFA has joined with two other organizations in the Financial Planning Coalition (FPC) to push for greater change for consumers, at a time when an economic downturn and investment scandals have affected the financial security of nearly all Americans. NAPFA, the Financial Planning Association, and the CFP Board of Standards formed the Financial Planning Coalition to work with Congress and federal agencies to strengthen the rules on financial advisors' fiduciary conduct, fee disclosures, and conflicts of interest.\n\nAmong the FPC's successes in this area have been greater disclosure of 12b-1 marketing fees by mutual funds and the SEC study in fall 2010 of a need for a consumer-first fiduciary requirement on investment brokers.\n"}

The film features series regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth and Hattie Jacques. It was the 23rd and final appearance for Charles Hawtrey. June Whitfield returned after appearing in \"Carry On Nurse\" 13 years earlier. Jimmy Logan and Carol Hawkins made their first of two appearances in the series.\n\nAlong with the previous film in the series (\"Carry On Matron\"), it features the highest number of the regular \"Carry On\" team. The only members missing are Jim Dale and Terry Scott, both of whom had left the series by this point (although Dale would return belatedly for \"Carry On Columbus\" in 1992) and, as a result, were never in a \"Carry On\" film together.\n\nThe film opens with pub landlord and frequent holidaymaker Vic Flange (Sid James) openly flirting with the sassy saucepot widow Sadie Tompkins (Barbara Windsor) as his battleaxe wife, Cora (Joan Sims), looks on with disdain. Their twitching friend Harry (Jack Douglas) arrives and lets slip that the package holiday Vic has booked to the Mediterranean island Elsbels (a pun on the slang expression \"Hell's Bells\") which is on the Costa Bomm, also includes Sadie, much to Cora's outrage. Cora, who avoids holidays because she hates flying, suddenly decides to accompany her boorish husband on the trip, to ensure he keeps away from Sadie.\n\nThe next day, Stuart Farquhar (Kenneth Williams), the representative of Wundatours Travel Agency, and his sexy, seductive assistant, Moira Plunkett (Gail Grainger), welcome the motley passengers. Among them are the henpecked and sex-starved Stanley Blunt (Kenneth Connor) and his overbearing, conservative, frigid wife, Evelyn (June Whitfield); a drunken, bowler-hatted mummy's boy, Eustace Tuttle (Charles Hawtrey); brash Scotsman Bert Conway (Jimmy Logan); young and beautiful friends Lily and Marge (Sally Geeson and Carol Hawkins respectively), who are each hoping to find a man to fall in love with; and a party of monks, including Brother Bernard (Bernard Bresslaw) a timid young monk who has difficulty fitting into his new path of life.\n\nUnfortunately, upon their arrival they discover their hotel is only half-finished; the builders have just quit suddenly for unspecified reasons, leaving the remaining five floors unfinished. Distraught manager Pepe (Peter Butterworth) desperately tries to run the place in myriad different guises – the manager, the doorman and the porter – and the chef is his irate, ill-tempered wife, Floella (Hattie Jacques), who battles repeatedly with the temperamental stove while their handsome, womanising son Georgio (Ray Brooks) idles behind the bar. The hotel also hides an assortment of faults and Pepe is soon overrun with complaints: Evelyn finds Mr Tuttle in her bath, Vic discovers Sadie naked in his shower; Lily and Marge's wardrobe has no back to it, allowing them to be accidentally seen by Brother Bernard in the opposite room; sand pours out of Moira's taps; the lavatory drenches Bert. The phone system itself is faulty and the guests end up complaining to each other for much of the time. Nevertheless, Stuart is determined to ensure everyone has a good time.\n\nDinner the first night is foul and made even more unpleasant by the smoke from the burning food in the kitchen, which forces the motley group of holiday-makers to open the windows, prompting the arrival of mosquitos. Although agreeing to play leapfrog with Tuttle, Lily and Marge have their eyes on other things. Marge takes a shine to Brother Bernard, while Lily lures the dashing Nicholas (David Kernan) away from his jealous (and implied gay) friend, Robin (John Clive), and Marge and Bernard develop an innocent romance. Meanwhile, Stanley attempts to seduce Cora whilst his nagging wife is not present, but Cora is more interested in keeping Vic away from Sadie, who grows fond of Bert. Vic tries to put Bert off Sadie by telling him that she is a black widow who murdered her two previous husbands, when in fact both were firemen who died on the job.\n\nThe next day, while most of the party go off on an excursion to the nearby village, Stanley ensures his wife is left behind so that he can spend the day attempting to woo Cora. Vic samples a local drink, \"Santa Cecelia's Elixir\", which blesses the drinker with X-ray vision and he is able to see through women's clothing. However, the tourists are arrested for causing a riot at Madame Fifi's (Olga Lowe) local brothel after Vic, Bert and Eustace annoy the girls there; left-behind Evelyn is seduced by Georgio, which leads to her abandoning her frigid manners.\n\nIn the local prison, Miss Plunkett seduces the Chief of Police, and the tourists are released. Back at the hotel, Mrs Blunt resumes her sex life with a surprised Stanley after having a brief affair with Georgio. The last night in the hotel starts as a success, with all the guests at ease with each other thanks to the punch being spiked with Santa Cecelia's Elixir. Midway through the night it begins to rain, and the hotel is shown to have been constructed on a dry river bed. As the hotel begins to collapse Pepe finally loses his patience and sanity with the guests, who party on, oblivious to the disintegrating hotel.\n\nThe film then shifts forward an unspecified period of time, and shows an Elsbels reunion at Vic & Cora's pub. All the guests are happy and reminisce about the holiday they barely survived.\n\n\n\nThe film's opening credits also include 'Sun Tan Lo Tion' (sun tan lotion) as 'Technical Director'.\n\nThe brothel keeper is played by Olga Lowe, one of the first actresses to work with Sid James when he arrived in the UK in 1946. Lowe was also the actress on stage with James on the night he died in Sunderland.\n\n\nInterior/Exterior film locations:\n\nBagshot, Surrey: Road to the airport.\n\nHigh Street, Slough: Wundatours travel agency shop (site has since been redeveloped and is now Cornwall House)\n\nPinewood Studios: Elsbels hotel interior and exterior scenes.

These nicknames are typically derived from well-known symbols of Australia. Often the nickname is combined with that of a commercial sponsor, such as the \"Qantas Wallabies\" or the \"Telstra Dolphins\". Some names are a portmanteau word with second element \"-roo\", from kangaroo; such as \"Olyroos\" for the Olympic association football team.\n\nThe oldest nicknames are \"Kangaroos\" and \"Wallabies\" for the rugby league football and rugby union teams. The other names are more recent, mostly invented to help publicise sports not traditionally popular in Australia. Some journalists have criticised the practice as embarrassing, gimmicky, or PR-driven.\n\nThe name \"Wallabies\" was chosen by the 1908 rugby union side, making its first tour of the Northern Hemisphere. British newspapers had already nicknamed the 1905 New Zealand touring team the \"All Blacks\" from their kit colour; the 1906 South African tourists had adopted \"Springboks\". \"Rabbits\" was first suggested for Australia, but rejected since rabbits there are notorious as pests. Until the 1980s, only touring sides were \"Wallabies\"; players on the eight tours up to 1984 were \"the First Wallabies\" up to \"the Eighth Wallabies\".\n\nThe rugby league tour side arrived in Britain later in 1908 with a live kangaroo as mascot and were nicknamed \"Kangaroos\". \"Kangaroos\" originally referred only to teams on \"Kangaroo Tours\" to Britain and France. In 1994 the Australian Rugby League extended the nickname to all internationals for sponsorship reasons, drawing criticism for the break with tradition. The first such game was a 58–0 win over France at Parramatta Stadium on 6 July 1994.\n\nAmong the longer-established sports, the test cricket and Davis Cup tennis teams have no common nickname. Harry Beitzel's 1967 Australian Football World Tour team was unofficially nicknamed the Galahs from their flashy uniform. Though this side was a precursor of subsequent Australian international rules football teams, the nickname has not been retained.\n\n\"Australian Tennis\" magazine invited readers to suggest a nickname for the Davis Cup team in 1996. The Australia Fed Cup team has been called the Cockatoos, first suggested by player Casey Dellacqua in a press conference at the April 2012 match against Germany. The name has been embraced by teammates and used on the website of governing body Tennis Australia.\n\nAs part of a 1998 strategic business plan, Cricket Australia surveyed \"stakeholders\" in 1998 about a possible nickname, to enhance marketing opportunities. State cricket teams in the Sheffield Shield had benefited from adopting nicknames in the 1990s. 69% opposed a national nickname, partly from a sense of decorum and partly because the best names were already taken by other teams.\n\nAthletics Australia held a competition for a nickname for its squad for the 2001 World Athletics Championships. The winning entry was \"the Diggers\", from the nickname for ANZAC soldiers. This was quickly abandoned after criticism from the Returned and Services League of Australia and others that this was an inappropriate use of the term. The team previously had a little-used nickname, \"the Blazers\".\n\nIn December 2004, the Australian Soccer Association renamed itself Football Federation Australia (FFA) and announced an effort to rebrand association football as \"football\" rather than \"soccer\" in Australia. The national team had been nicknamed \"the Socceroos\" by journalist Tony Horstead on a 1967 tour to South Vietnam. FFA chairman Frank Lowy commented \"It has been commonly used and is a much loved name but we may see it fade out as evolution takes place\", and suggested few national football teams had nicknames. By 2016, the FFA announcement of Caltex as sponsors was titled \"Caltex Australia with the Socceroos all the way\".\n\n"}

This source adds that he subdued Elam, and reigned 900 years.\n\nHe is the earliest ruler on the king list whose name is attested directly from archaeology. Two alabaster vase fragments inscribed with his name were found at Nippur where, according to the Sumerian \"Tummal Inscription\", he is said to have built the first temple:\n\nThere are in all at least four surviving fragments bearing the abbreviated form \"Mebarag(e)si\", describing him as the \"lugal\" of Kish. One of them, in the Baghdad Museum, reads \"Mebaragsi, King of Kish\". As of today, \"two fragments of alabaster vessels bear dedication inscriptions of Mebaragesi, king of Kish\" are known, which confirms the historicity of this king. The fragments verifying Enmebaragesi's historicity enhance the notion that Gilgamesh is also historical.\n\nEnmebaragesi is also mentioned in a section of the original Sumerian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", \"Bilgamesh and Aga\", as the father of the Aga who laid siege to Uruk. The \"Sumerian King List\" and the \"Tummal Inscription\" concur with the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" in making him the father of Aga, who was the final king of the 1st dynasty of Kish. Enmebaragesi is said to have been vanquished by Gilgamesh in a document written by Shulgi, but earlier texts describe his son Aga of Kish as having been vanquished instead.\n\nThe later Sumerian Renaissance (Ur III) king Shulgi addressed one of his praise poems to Gilgamesh, that credits Gilgamesh with capturing and defeating Enmebaragesi — thus contradicting the king list, where he was already captured by Gilgamesh's predecessor. In another part of the Gilgamesh epic, Gilgamesh offers his \"sister\" Enmebaragesi to be the wife of the monster Huwawa or Humbaba, causing some debate as to Enmebaragesi's gender, with most scholars taking this reference as a jest.\n\nIn the 2009 comedy film \"Year One\", a film parodying historical, biblical and mythical persons, places and events, Enmebaragesi is portrayed as one of the best hunters from the village.\n"}

It is owned and operated by Station Casinos and has 1,053 rooms. Palace Station has a large Asian customer base mainly because of its location near Chinatown.\n\nIn 1976, Frank Fertitta Jr., a former general manager at the Fremont, and his two partners, opened The Casino, a gambling hall attached to a Mini Price Motor Inn, in an off-Strip location where few observers expected it to succeed. In 1977, he added bingo and renamed the property as the Bingo Palace. The casino was the first to target a clientele of local residents with offerings like giveaways, cheap buffets and bingo. It thrived, and Fertitta soon bought out his partners' shares. Other locals casinos like Sam's Town and the Gold Coast followed in later years.\n\nIn 1984, the Bingo Palace was expanded and remodeled with a railroad theme, and renamed to the Palace Station Hotel & Casino. The grand opening ceremony was held on April 6, featuring Governor Richard Bryan and the historic locomotive \"Inyo\". A train-themed neon sign, measuring wide and high, was constructed for Palace Station. In 1985, Fertitta purchased the adjoining 465-room motel. A 21-story hotel tower and high-rise parking garage were added in 1990, bringing the room count to 1,041.\n\nIn 1993, Fertitta bought the land for what would become Boulder Station, the beginning of an expansion that would grow Station Casinos into a billion dollar company. But Fertitta left the firm that same year, turning management over to his sons when it went public.\n\nEarly in 2009, Improv Vegas opened at the \"Bonkerz Comedy Club\" which was renamed from the Sound Trax lounge. The tower rooms have recently been remodeled.\n\nOn October 17, 2016, employees voted to narrowly reject the unionization of a hotel and casino property by 266 to 262. It was organized by the Bartenders Union and the Culinary Workers Union and supervised by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under the Obama administration. It was the first and only Station Casinos property to not be unionized by a vote margin.\n\nOn March 13, 2017, Station Casinos agreed to settle disputes with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under the Trump administration by letting these employees, the Bartenders Union and the Culinary Workers Union to unionize the property. It is the third Station Casinos property to be unionized.\n\nA $192 million renovation began in fall 2016, and was completed two years later. Palace Station remained open during renovations. As part of the renovation, the Palace Station's train theme was removed in favor of a modern design. Eight faux locomotives on the front of the building were removed, and one was donated to the city's Neon Museum, along with a Palace Station neon sign measuring long. The 126-foot Palace Station sign was removed during 2018, marking the end of the train theme. Palace Station's motel portion, with approximately 447 rooms, was demolished as part of the renovation project. A new bingo room opened during 2017.\n\nA grand re-opening celebration, including a fireworks show, was held on September 1, 2018. The addition included 500 additional slot machines and a 300-space parking lot on the property's east side. The renovation also featured four new restaurants, including a revamped buffet. A movie theater, part of the renovation project, is scheduled for completion in December 2018.\n\nThe hotel has seen its share of accidents and misadventures, including a cashier's cage robbery in 1992, a 21st-floor fire caused by lightning in 1998, an armored car robbery in the parking lot in 2009 and most notoriously, the 2007 robbery of sports memorabilia by O.

The name is an amalgam of Lawndale and Crescentville, the two primary communities that make up the neighborhood. The Summerdale community is also as of more recent years considered an extended part of Lawncrest. The Philadelphia Inquirer does not consider Lawncrest to be a neighborhood.\n\nThe primary ZIP Code is 19111 (Fox Chase Post Office) for the area North of Comly Street and 19120 (Olney P.O.) for the area South of Comly Street. Most of the southern end of the Community is actually built on the former property of the Wentz Farm. Portions of the East side of Crescentville are actually built over former swamp land, while the West side was built on more stable bedrock.Rising Sun Avenue (formerly 2nd Street Pike) is usually identified as the main artery through Lawncrest, though originally, Ashmead Road/Levick Street was the primary Road.\n\nSwedes and Germans settled the area as early as 1638. \n\nThe community can trace its roots back to the 19th century as a small German community known to some as Marburg. Parts of Crescentville were known as \"Grubbtown\" during the Civil War. The main artery of the community, Rising Sun Avenue, was originally a toll road known as the Kensington & Oxford Turnpike. A sole remaining marker of this toll road once stood in front of the Engine 64 Firehouse at Rising Sun and Benner, near the bus stop. \n\nThe area of Lawncrest extends from Tacony Creek Park to Tyson Avenue. Adjacent neighborhoods include:\nFox Chase/Burholme to the north, Oxford Circle/Castor Gardens and Frankford to the east and southeast, and Olney, and Feltonville to the south and southwest. To the West is Cheltenham Township, Montgomery County. \n\nThe Newtown Branch/New York Short Line of the Reading Railroad (now SEPTA/CSX) separates Lawncrest from Montgomery County. Tookany/Tacony Creek also skirts through a portion of the Community. \n\nTwo SEPTA Fox Chase Line Regional Rail stations serve the community: Lawndale Station at Robbins and Newtown Aves and Cheltenham Station at Martins Mill Road and Hasbrook Ave. Crescentville Station, closed in the 1970s, was located at the bottom of Godfrey Ave, behind Bond Bread and was nothing more than a dirt/gravel platform. A second Crescentville Station, which served the Frankford Branch of the Reading RR, was located directly behind the Bond Bread building on the south side of the railroad right of way. It was closed when passenger service ended on that branch in the 1930s. \n\nSeveral SEPTA bus lines also serve the community. The route 18 bus runs from Cedarbrook Mall–Olney Terminal up to Fox Chase using Rising Sun, while the routes 19, 24, 26 and 67 buses serve the Eastern portions of the neighborhood, connecting to the Olney, Frankford and Fern Rock Transportation Centers via direct service or single transfer. All routes have connecting service to the Broad Street subway and Market-Frankford elevated lines.\n\nThere are about a dozen Protestant Churches within the Community, the oldest being Trinity Oxford Church which dates back to 1698.\n\nSt. William's Parish, founded in 1920, covers most of the Crescentville end of the community and part of the lower end of Lawndale, from Magee Avenue South, while the upper end of Lawndale approximately covers the area of Presentation B.V.M. Parish which was founded in 1890 and also serves a large portion of the southeast corner of Cheltenham PA, in Montgomery County. \n\nOriginally known as Hill Creek Project. The public housing project was built on 23.4 acres during Franklin Roosevelts Administration was opened in March, 1938, purportedly the last such project built during his administration. Located on a hill overlooking the Tookany Creek in North East Philadelphia on the corner of Rising Sun and Adams Avenues. in the area known as Lawncrest Administered by the Philadelphia Public Housing Authority, it has 334 units of single family, two story apartments. and provides Section 8 (housing) for low income families.\n\nAccording to Kathleen McDonough, who grew up in the area, \"Households were typically ones in which dad worked and mom stayed home.\"\n\nIt is in the School District of Philadelphia Most teens who live in Lawncrest attend either Northeast High School (public), or Samuel Fels High School (public). Two Public elementary schools served the area - Ben Franklin Universal Creighton Charter School,the Truebright Science Academy (a charter school grades 7-12) .and in addition, Presentation BVM Parish School and Cedar Grove Christian Academy (in the former Lawndale Public School building) serve the private sector in education. St. William Parish School Closed in 2012 and is now the location of MaST II Charter School. Until 1991 Students attended Olney High School.\n\nMcDonough stated that children who attended public and Catholic schools were known as a \"public\" or a \"Catholic\", respectively, and that children tended to attend schools in their own communities.\n\nThe Naval Inventory Control Point is located at 700 Robbins St; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111\n\n"}

Sarsfield, an officer and commander of . He disappeared after the sinking of his ship and was presumed dead on 11 July 1943.\n\n\"Sarsfield\" was laid down on 15 January 1945 by the Bath Iron Works Co., Bath, Maine and launched on 27 May 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Eugene S. Sarsfield. The ship was commissioned at Boston Naval Shipyard on 31 July 1945, with Commander Hepburn A. Pierce in command.\n\nAfter the ship's fitting-out was complete, it sailed on 24 August, for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and shakedown training. She returned to Boston on 30 September and, after post-shakedown alterations, got underway, on 25 October, for New York City and the Navy Day celebration. Following her stay at New York, she participated in training exercises in the Chesapeake Bay-Virginia Capes area until 13 December, when she entered the Brooklyn Navy Yard for installation of some experimental equipment.\n\nOn 1 February 1946, \"Sarsfield\" sailed from New York bound for Key West, Florida. She arrived in Key West on 4 February to begin two decades with the Operational Development Force located there. Attached to the Surface Antisubmarine Development Detachment, Atlantic Fleet, she participated in the testing and evaluation of new weapons and equipment and made periodic training cruises in the Caribbean and in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1950, the ship helped the new Eastern Test Range out of Cape Canaveral test two U.S. Army Bumpers, which were German V-2 rockets modified to carry an upper stage. \"Sarsfield\" was stationed a mile or two from shore for the first, 48-mile Bumper launch, and tracked it with its Mk.25 fire director, which provided radar and optical tracking.\n\nIn addition to the work she did for the Operational Development Force, \"Sarsfield\" also served the Naval Mine Countermeasures Station at Panama City, Florida, from 9 to 14 February 1947; conducted operations for the Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London, Connecticut, from 3 September 1953 until 18 October 1954; and operated out of Newport, Rhode Island, between 8 July and 4 August 1955.\n\nIn 1956, she embarked VIPs for ASW demonstrations out of Key West and, in 1957, underwent overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard. On 6 February 1958, she joined units of Escort Squadron 14 at Charleston, South Carolina, for anti-submarine exercises. Following a cruise as plane guard to the aircraft carrier in early 1958, she returned to the Operational Development Force at Key West on 15 February. In the fall of 1958, \"Sarsfield\" entered Charleston Naval Shipyard for another overhaul. She departed Charleston on 5 January 1959 and conducted five weeks of refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after which she returned to Key West and further experimental work.\n\nThis employment, testing antisubmarine detection and destruction devices, continued until January 1961, when she was deployed, with shore bombardment responsibilities, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Later that year, in June, Caribbean unrest again required the Navy to deploy ships. \"Sarsfield\" cruised off the coast of Hispaniola. In September 1961, \"Sarsfield\" took station in the Atlantic as a recovery ship for Project Mercury, the manned space flight program.\n\nIn January 1962, she again took station for Project Mercury, this time off the coast of Africa. In August, she entered Boston Naval Shipyard for almost a year of Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. Before leaving Boston, in June 1963, she received several new weapons systems, including ASROC, DASH, long-range, distant air search radar and long-range sonar. From Boston, she sailed to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training; then, to Charleston for another six months of weapons and sonar modifications. At the completion of these latest alterations, she cruised the Caribbean and then returned to Key West and the Operational Test and Evaluation Detachment. This employment continued until 1966. On 15 July, she again commenced overhaul, including still more sonar and radar changes.\n\nThe overhaul was completed on 30 January 1967; and, by 7 February, she was back in Key West. \"Sarsfield\" spent the remainder of the month engaged in refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In April, she joined the aircraft carrier for ASW exercises; then, returned to Key West on 1 May to operate with the Fleet Sonar School. June and July were occupied by fleet exercises and NATO exercise, \"Lashout\". On 21 September, \"Sarsfield\" departed Key West for the Mediterranean and, on 17 December, returned home.\n\nIn early 1968, she operated off the Virginia Capes and in the Caribbean. In July 1968, she deployed to the Middle East. She called at many exotic ports on her voyage along the coasts of Africa and the Indian Ocean littoral. While on this tour of duty, \"Sarsfield\" also had the unique opportunity to participate in a spontaneous exercise with units of the Imperial Ethiopian Navy and the French Air Force. By 30 December, she was underway for the western hemisphere and, on 10 January 1969, arrived in Mayport, Florida.\n\n\"Sarsfield\" remained in the western hemisphere for all of 1969 and 1970. During the first seven months of 1969, she resumed Caribbean and Atlantic operations. On 28 July, she commenced UNITAS X, an exercise involving elements of the United States, Brazilian, Argentine, Colombian, Chilean, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, Venezuelan and Uruguayan navies. In December, upon the completion of this exercise, during which she visited ports in all the countries named, \"Sarsfield\" returned to Mayport to prepare for overhaul.\n\nFrom January to June 1970, she was at Charleston, South Carolina, undergoing overhaul. In June, she commenced eight weeks of refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and, upon completing it, returned to local operations out of Mayport for the rest of the year.\n\nIn January 1971, \"Sarsfield\" again deployed to the Middle East, entering the Indian Ocean in February. Tensions were rising in the region; the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out in March and led to the war between India and Pakistan in December. By 29 June, she was back at Mayport and resumed normal operations for the rest of 1971 and for the first three months of 1972.\n\nOn 13 April 1972, she got underway for an entirely different deployment. Proceeding via the Panama Canal, she arrived in Subic Bay, Philippines, on 11 May. Throughout the summer, \"Sarsfield\" plied the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, first as plane guard for the carrier , then, patrolling off Hainan Island. She also participated in shore bombardment missions. She departed the gunline on 12 September; stopped at Hong Kong for six days of liberty (15 to 21 September) and at Yokosuka, Japan, for four days (25 to 29 September); and then, got underway to return to the United States.\n\nShe entered San Diego on 13 October, transited the Panama Canal on 21 October, and reentered Mayport on 25 October. Upon her return, she resumed local operations out of Mayport. This employment continued until 29 May 1973, when she weighed anchor to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean.\n\nShe sailed with the 6th Fleet until 22 September, when she passed through the Straits of Gibraltar to join NATO units in exercises in the Bay of Biscay and in the North Sea. On 10 October, she entered the Firth of Forth and, the next day, berthed at Edinburgh, Scotland. Two days later, at the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli War, she departed Scotland to reenter the Mediterranean with the carrier and sped to the eastern end of that sea. After more than a month of uncertainty, \"Sarsfield\" put into Athens, Greece, on 14 November for a five-day tender and leave period.\n\nOn 18 November, she was ordered to rejoin \"John F. Kennedy\" for the voyage back to the United States. She arrived at Mayport on 1 December and spent the rest of 1973 in a standdown and leave status. She remained in port at Mayport, Florida until May 1974 at which time she resumed Atlantic seaboard operations.\n\nOn 14 June 1974, in protest of perceived racism on the part of the command, nearly all of the ship's minority sailors occupied the fantail and refused orders to handle lines while \"Sarsfield\" was attempting a difficult mooring in an off-setting wind at the Charleston Naval Station. After being surrounded by the ship's Master-at-Arms force and being individually ordered by the Executive Officer, most of the demonstrating sailors returned to their quarters. Seven of them, however, refused to leave the quarterdeck despite direct orders to do so, and eventually left the ship without authority to do so. The seven sailors were eventually apprehended and originally charged with, among other things, mutiny. They were all eventually convicted of lesser charges in a joint General Courts Martial at NAS Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nIn the fall of 1974, \"Sarsfield\" departed Mayport, Florida to participate in Northern Merger with NATO units, and enjoyed port visits in Plymouth, England and Edinburgh, Scotland, as well as Lubeck, West Germany.\n\n\"Sarsfield\" deployed on a Mediterranean cruise from 27 July 1975 to 27 January 1976, and enjoyed port visits in Gibraltar, BCC, Barcelona, Valencia, Rota and Algeciras, Spain, Siracusa and Taormina, Sicily, Naples, Italy, Palma, Mallorca, as well as Athens, and after transiting the Bosporus and Dardanelles, steamed in company with in the Black Sea.\n\nThe year 1976 saw gunnery practice in Chesapeake Bay, and a short shipyard period in Charleston, South Carolina. Winter of 1976-1977 was the ship's last deployment to the Mediterranean as part of the task force. Port visits included Rota, Spain; Naples, Italy; Trapani, Sicily (helping the city recover from a flood); Kalamata, Greece (American-style hamburger cookout at the local orphanage at Christmas); Sfax, Tunisia; Palma and Morocco. She anchored off the coast of Egypt with dozens of Russian ships and monitored Russian submarine operations; as well as extensive operations as part of \"Roosevelt\"s group. On return to the United States, many Taiwanese sailors joined the crew to learn ship operations before \"Sarsfield\" was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1977. On the same day she was transferred to the Republic of China (Taiwan).\n\nThe ship served in the Republic of China Navy as ROCS \"Te Yang\" (DDG-925). \"Te Yang\" was decommissioned on 1 April 2005 at Kaohsiung, Taiwan. On 22 January 2009, the ship was towed to the Anping Port in Tainan City. It is now a museum ship.\n\n\"Sarsfield\" earned one battle star for service in the Vietnam War.\n"}

A right-handed-hitting and -throwing infielder, he played minor league baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization between 1951 and 1958, hitting .270 with 890 hits in 858 games played before retiring to become Arizona State's head baseball coach at age 29.\n\nFrom 1959–1971 Winkles was Arizona State's first varsity baseball coach for Sun Devil baseball. His overall record while head coach at ASU was 524–173, a winning percentage of .751. In his 11 years, Winkles coached ASU to its first three national titles (1965, 1967 and 1969). He also coached several notable players while he was at the helm of the Sun Devils, including Rick Monday, Sal Bando, Reggie Jackson, Sterling Slaughter, and Larry Gura. Winkles was named the 1965 and 1969 NCAA Coach of the Year and The Sporting News Coach of the Year in 1965, 1967 and 1969. Winkles was inducted into the ABCA Collegiate Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997. His No. 1 jersey was honored at Packard Stadium and the field was named in his honor.\n\nIn 1972, Winkles jumped from the Arizona State campus to the major leagues as a coach for the California Angels of the American League. In 1973, Winkles became the Angels' manager, succeeding Del Rice. His 1973 club won 79, lost 83 and finished fourth in the American League West Division. But in 1974, the Angels lost 44 of their first 75 games and Winkles was fired on June 26 and replaced with Dick Williams.\n\nOn July 8, two weeks after the Angels fired him, Winkles became third base coach for the Oakland Athletics and was a member of their 1974 World Series championship team as well as their 1975 AL West champions under skipper Alvin Dark. After Dark's firing, Winkles then spent 1976 through June 25, 1977, as a coach for the cross-bay San Francisco Giants.\n\nOn June 26, Winkles returned to the Athletics to manage Oakland for parts of the 1977 and 1978 seasons, as he replaced (in 1977) and then was succeeded by (in 1978) the same manager: Jack McKeon. The A's were then a struggling outfit in the final throes of the Charlie Finley era. But Winkles' 1978 team roared to a 19–5 start by May 5, and was still 24–15 after sweeping a doubleheader against the White Sox on May 21 when Winkles resigned with his club in first place in the AL West. Winkles was reported to have resigned because of Finley's micro-management style. His final managerial record: 170 wins, 213 defeats (.444).\n\nA coaching stint with the White Sox immediately followed Winkles' 1978 resignation as the A's manager, and he was a member of the White Sox staff through 1981.

The venue, which opened in 1988, dates back to the early 1900s as a nickelodeon. Over the years, the venue has seen many incarnations ranging from concert hall to movie theatre to theatre. Known for its acoustics, it was voted as one of the best concert venues in America by \"Complex\".\n\nThe theatre opened in 1908 as the \"Crystal Palace\", seating nearly 700. In 1927, the venue became a concert hall. In 1941, Warner Bros. Circuit Management Corporation took over management of the venue converting it into a movie theatre. Along with the changes came a new name, the \"New Palace Theatre\". The theatre’s popularity declined in the 50s. By 1959, the theatre saw another reincarnation, this time as a repertory theatre. The theatre operated under the direction of stage veteran Anne Ramsey and her husband Logan Ramsey. This is also when the name, \"Theatre of the Living Arts\" came into being.\n\nIn 1964, Andre Gregory took over from the Ramseys as artistic director. The theatre proved to be a critical success, presenting 10 productions per season, all to high praise. Some troupe members included: Danny DeVito, Judd Hirsch, Sally Kirkland, Ron Leibman and Morgan Freeman. In 1967, a dispute with the board of directors resulted in Gregory leaving the theatre on February 17, 1967. At this time, the theatre was taken over by a new firm and christened as the \"Bandbox Living Arts\", a beatnik house. The theatre saw a decline in popularity and closed in 1969 due to financial issues.\n\nIn 1970, business entrepreneur Al Malmfelt purchased the theatre. It reopened a year later as a single screen cinema; specializing in hard to see films. Nearly 20 films were shown per week. The movie house showed classic films, alongside art films, foreigns, serials and controversial films. There was also a monsters at midnight film series, with the venue showing horror films. In 1976, it premiered \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". The TLA was the first theatre in Philadelphia to show this \"midnight movie\" which became an instant success with fans and led to weekly showings, encouraging the audience to dress as their favorite characters and return week after week.\n\nIn 1978, the American Theater Arts for Youth used the venue for several productions including: \"Babes in Toyland\", \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\". It left the venue in 1982 to seek a bigger audience. By November 1980, the theatre was once again in financial trouble. The theatre folded once again in 1981.\n\nStephen Starr purchased the building for $600,000 in March 1981. He hoped to bring his Starr nightclub to a bigger facility, however, this was prevented by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and local residents of the neighborhood. Instead, Starr reopened the cinema under the name The Palace, however it closed again September 1981. In 1981, former employees Claire Brown Kohler, Eric Moore and Ray Murray began working on how to reopen the theatre. Together, they formed the Repertory Cinema, Inc. (later becoming the TLA Entertainment Group). When the theatre reopened, to save costs, the new team would travel round trip to New York City to exchange reels.\n\nDue to the success of VHS and cable television, the cinema saw a decline in attendance. In 1985, the team then opened TLA Video to cater to that audience. The initial store opened next to the theatre, however, four additional locations were added throughout the Philadelphia metro area. All stores closed in 2011.\n\nIn 1986 the TLA premiered Jean-Luc Godard's Hail Mary which sparked outrage among Catholics. Many protesters picketed outside the TLA for a week while they showed the film.\nIn 1987, the cinema folded again. Allan Spivak purchased the theatre in September 1987. and renovations took place to convert the venue from a cinema into an off-Broadway type of theatre. Its first show was a production of the 1986 Outer Critics Circle Awards winning (and 2014 Tony Award winning) musical Lady Day (a musical based upon the life of Billie Holiday) which opened October 21, 1987. \n\nA year later, the theatre was converted into a concert venue. In 2007, Live Nation purchased the venue. It was briefly known as \"The Fillmore at TLA\" (commonly The Fillmore Philadelphia) until June 2008.\n\nIn addition to its various incarnations through the twentieth century, the building housing the TLA has also undergone transformations. After the New Palace Theatre became The Theatre of the Living Arts in 1959, in 1965 it underwent renovations designed by one of its founders, Philadelphia modernist architect Frank Weise. At that time the theatre expanded to the next door property, expanding the venue.\n\nThe venue was later renovated in 2006 when Live Nation purchased the theatre and it became The Fillmore. The company updated the theatre with hardwood floors and three large chandeliers. The theatre is known for its memorabilia hanging on the dark red walls inside the venue. \n\nSouth Street's reputation for entertainment extends to the turn of the twentieth century. However, in 1950 there was a major decline in real-estate value due to the proposal of a crosstown expressway that would have wiped out South Street. The Theatre of the Living Arts founding helped re-establish the street's entertainment culture and ushered in a, revival of the street. The theatre was a success during this time period selling over 250,000 tickets between 1964-1969. The TLA set the stage for the bohemian counter culture that flocked to this street along with other consumer and artistic venues. The street had a major rise in galleries and cafes that surrounded the TLA. \n\nSouth Street has become a center for alternative countercultures. In its current iteration as a concert venue, the theatre welcomes unknown and up-and-coming bands as well as bigger bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nThe TLA entertainment group branched off of the TLA movie theatre and was originally the group that ran the theatre. The group was founded in 1981 by Ray Murray, Claire Brown Kohler, and Eric Moore. During this time the TLA was a movie theater where they showed an eclectic mix of movies including foreign films and cult classics. The entertainment group formed off of it and became a movie distribution store where they had a variety of obscure movies available for rent by catalog, online, and in their own retail stores. The original retail store opened right next door to the theatre.\n\nIn February 1986 the TLA found itself in the middle of a controversy when the theatre decided to show Jean-Luc Godard’s \"Hail Mary.\" The film was very controversial among Catholics at the time leading it to be denounced by Pope John Paul II in April 1985. In response to the announcement of the film's premiere, the TLA group received a hundred calls a day and two thousand letters in protest. The film was eventually shown at the TLA for a week and was met with picketers and protesters causing South Street to be shut down for the time being.\n\nThe TLA has been accredited in helping launch filmmaker and writer John Waters's career. During its movie theatre days, the TLA played his cult classic movies such as Pink Flamingos when no other mainstream movie theatre would. Due to the huge success of his films at the TLA, other theatres followed making the TLA an important aspect of Pink Flamingos' and John Waters' success.\n\nHouse Of Blues\n"}

Boteach is the author of 30 books, including \"Kosher Sex: A Recipe for Passion and Intimacy\" (1999), and \"Kosher Jesus\" (2012). His outspokenness has earned him praise and criticism; \"Newsweek\" magazine named him one of the 50 most influential rabbis in the United States three years in a row, including sixth in 2010. He resides in Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nBoteach attended and graduated from Hebrew Academy.\n\nIn 1988, Boteach was sent at age 22 by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson as a Chabad-Lubavitch \"shaliach\" (emissary) to Oxford, England, where he served as rabbi to Oxford's students for 11 years and during that time founded the L'Chaim Society. Under Boteach's leadership the Oxford L'Chaim Society grew to be the second-largest student organization in Oxford's history, with a membership that included over 5,000 non-Jews. A dispute erupted when Boteach was asked to remove some non-Jewish students from the society, including future senator Cory Booker, but refused. Later that year Boteach won the \"Preacher of the Year\" Award from the London \"Times\".\n\nIn 2008, Boteach was named ninth on \"Newsweek\"s list of the \"Top 50 Rabbis in America\", and in 2009 he was named seventh. In 2010, Boteach was listed on the \"Newsweek\" list at number six.\n\nBoteach has faced widespread criticism from fellow rabbis during his career, especially following the release of his book \"Kosher Jesus\". It was denounced as \"heresy\" by some rabbis. Jacob Immanuel Schochet, a Canadian rabbi, stated that the book \"poses a tremendous threat to the Jewish community.\" In 1999, then Chief Rabbi of United Hebrew Congregations, Jonathan Sacks, banned Boteach from speaking at the New West End Synagogue in Bayswater, London.\n\nIn 2006, Boteach hosted the television series \"Shalom in the Home\". The series, which ran for two seasons on the TLC network, was a reality show in which Boteach counseled families and gave advice about relationships. In 2007, he was honored by the National Fatherhood Initiative with their most prestigious award for his efforts on \"Shalom in the Home\" and promoting the importance of a caring father in the contemporary family. He writes two syndicated columns, and is a frequent op-ed contributor to \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Jerusalem Post\" and other newspapers. He speaks extensively in the United States, Israel, and other countries.\n\nBoteach hosted a weekly radio show on WABC called \"The Shmuley Show\". He has made numerous guest appearances on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and other television programs, including \"The Dr. Phil Show\" (as a relationship and marriage expert), \"The Dr. Oz Show\", and others. Boteach hosted his own show on the \"Oprah XM Satellite Radio Network\" and his writings and quotes are published on the Oprah.com website.\n\nIn 2014, Boteach was a featured cast member in an episode for the Sundance Channel's \"Dream School\" series.\n\nHe is founder of \"This World: The Values Network\", an international organization dedicated to advancing universal Jewish values in the media and culture, and to affirming the Jewish people as a \"light unto the nations\". It has been reported by that in 2016, the network received over $1 million from Sheldon Adelson.\n\nIn the 1990s, Boteach became a friend and unofficial spiritual advisor to Michael Jackson. Some Jewish commentators were critical. \"Consorting with Michael Jackson might get Shmuley's name in the papers, but it's doubtful it will really encourage Jews to go to synagogue on Friday night\", wrote Benjamin Soskis in \"Slate\". Boteach was a vocal supporter of Jackson and \"dismissive of suggestions that Jackson's relationships with children have been anything other than wholesome. Why would anyone believe those charges? They said anyone who spends that amount of time with kids has to be sick. Well, that's not an indictment of Michael Jackson, that's an indictment of our society!\" He further stated: \"I was friendly with Michael for a year before anyone knew about it. I did my own investigation. He never had sex with the child he made the settlement with, and there are no others.\"\n\nIn 2001, Boteach was involved in \"Heal the Kids\" or \"Time for Kids\", a charity founded by Jackson to encourage parents to spend more time with their children. Jackson and Boteach had a falling-out in 2002.\n\nAfter Michael Jackson died, Boteach published \"The Michael Jackson Tapes\", a series of taped conversations he had with Jackson. Boteach said it was Jackson's wish that the conversations be published: \"This book is being published because it was Michael Jackson's desperate wish that it be so,\" he wrote in the prologue to the book.\n\nA second book was published in 2010: \"Honoring the Child Spirit: Inspiration and Learning from Our Children, in conversation with Michael Jackson\".\n\nBoteach wrote in a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed column on homosexuality that it is \"akin to the prohibition against lighting fire on the Sabbath or eating bread during Passover;\" but contends that the Bible is not vague with regard to homosexuality—it stands in contravention to the divine will. He believes that the biggest threat to marriage doesn't come from gay marriage, but heterosexual divorce. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach opposes the government's involvement in recognizing marriage, but supports state-sanctioned civil unions for all.\n\nBoteach has opened a dialogue with Christians, and specifically with Messianic Jews, who are considered to be apostates by most Jews. In 2008, he debated Douglas Jacoby and Shabir Ally, on The True Legacy of Abraham, and the next year he debated Douglas Jacoby on \"Judaism & Christianity: Which is the Religion of Peace?\" In 2008, he debated with Michael Brown, a leader of the Messianic Jews, on whether belief in Jesus is compatible with Judaism, and in his book \"Kosher Jesus\" he depicts Jesus as \"a Jewish patriot murdered by Rome for his struggle on behalf of his people.\" These positions have drawn opposition from many in the orthodox establishment, particularly from within the Chabad sect to which Boteach belongs. Rabbi Yitzchak Schochet, a leading British rabbi and a rival of Boteach's, called Boteach's attempts to reach out to Messianic Jews \"self-delusional\", and Rabbi Immanuel Schochet of Toronto, Yitzchak Schochet's father, banned the book to Orthodox Jewish readers. \"It is forbidden for anyone to buy or read this book,\" he said in an interview.\n\nBoteach is known for his flamboyance and self-promotion. In a comment he later described as only having been sarcastic, he was reported as saying \"God gave 10 commandments at Sinai, and the 11th commandment, which they expunged but which has come down orally, is 'Thou shalt do anything for publicity and recognition.'\"\n\nBoteach is supportive of Israel, and critical of American policy towards the country. Boteach has argued that the Obama administration \"bullied\" Israel, arguing that U.S. Middle Eastern policy is \"scandalous\" and \"disgusting\". He is also supportive of Israeli settlements, including the Hebron settlement, the residents of which he characterizes as marked by a particular \"warmth, friendliness and hospitality\" and views as being \"liberated from hatred.\"\n\nBoteach was criticized by Jewish organizations for an ad placed in \"The New York Times\" which read \"Susan Rice has a blind spot: Genocide\", and that her action has \"injected a degree of partisanship\" that is \"destructive of the fabric of the relationship\" between the US and Israel. Rice had criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for agreeing to speak to Congress about Iran's nuclear program without coordinating with the Obama administration. Boteach apologized quoting that the disagreement was over policy and he did not intend a personal attack. Speaking to CNN, Boteach said the purpose of the ad was to bring attention to his perception that the United States government has ignored genocides in the past, and continues to do so.\n\nBoteach ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2012 elections. He supported making family counseling tax deductible. He received the endorsement of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in April. Boteach won the Republican primary for New Jersey's 9th congressional district seat on June 5, and lost to 8th District Representative Bill Pascrell (whose old district was redistricted) in the November election, by a margin of 73.6% to 25.4%.\n\nDVDs\n\nBooks\n\n"}

In addition, there are 100,000 Arbëresh-Albanian speakers, as well as small numbers of Calabrian Greek speakers and pockets of Occitan.\n\nCalabrian (it: \"Calabrese\") refers to the Romance varieties spoken in Calabria, Italy. The varieties of Calabria are part of a strong dialect continuum that are generally recognizable as Calabrian, but that are usually divided into two different language groups:\n\n\nThe Amantea-Cirò line is generally considered an approximate demarcation between the Neapolitan and Sicilian language groups.\n\nThe linguistic division roughly corresponds with the historic administrative division already in place since medieval times: \"Calabria Citeriore\" (or Latin Calabria) and \"Calabria Ulteriore\" (or Greek Calabria). This is a broad generalization and many communities in the more central parts of the region exhibit features of both language groups.\n\nThe dialects of Calabria have been extensively studied, catalogued and commented upon by German philologist Gerhard Rohlfs. From the mid-1920s to the mid-1970s, he traveled the region extensively and assembled a very extensive, multi-volume dictionary.\n\nThe areas where Central–Southern Calabrian (\"calabbrìsi\" or \"calavrìsi\", in Sicilian) is spoken corresponds generally to the provinces of Reggio Calabria, Vibo Valentia, Catanzaro and the southern part of Crotone (Crotone, Isola di Capo Rizzuto, Cutro and vicinity). The term \"Sicilian-Calabrian\" is also used to distinguish the group from the Northern Calabrian group. It comprises Central Calabrian and Southern Calabrian.\nThe primary roots of the dialects is Latin. Southern and Central Calabrian dialects are strongly influenced by a Greek substratum and ensuing levels of Latin influence and other external Southern Italian superstrata, in part hindered by geography, resulted in the many local variations found between the idioms of Calabria. Nonetheless, the dialects have some influence from other languages, thanks to the periodic rule and influx of other cultures. As a result, French, Occitan and Spanish have left an imprint.\n\nFrench and Norman vocabulary entered the region via the kingdoms of the Normans and the Angevins in Calabria.\n\nOther words derived from Spanish, Catalan, and Occitan:\n\n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\n\"Tutti gli esseri umani nascono liberi ed eguali in dignità e diritti. Essi sono dotati di ragione e di coscienza e devono agire gli uni verso gli altri in spirito di fratellanza.\"\n\nThe Northern Calabrian dialects (\"calabbrìse\" or \"calavrìse\", in Neapolitan) are similar to other Neapolitan varieties and are significantly different from the dialects of southern Calabria. The dialects of the northern fringes of the Province of Cosenza give way to Campanian and Lucanian dialects; however, the majority of the province speaks the Cosentian dialect (\"u cusindinu\"). It is also spoken in the northern portion of the Province of Crotone and in the extreme northwest of the Province of Catanzaro.\n\nOne aspect of Northern Calabrian is that the use of the preterite is almost absent, in great contrast to the Sicilian varieties of the south. In Cosentian, the norm is \"he\" (or \"haju) pigliatu\" or \"signu jutu\" (literally \"I took\" and \"I went\"); whereas the preterite (distant remote tense) \"pigghiai\" or \"ivi\" would be more common in the rest of Calabria. Other aspects are the phonetic modifications similar to other Neapolitan dialects, such as where \"-nt\" is pronounced \"-nd\" (\"praticamente\" becomes \"praticamende\"), and \"v\" is usually pronounced \"b\". In addition, spoken Cosentian is noted for its \"soft\" truncation of end syllables at the termination of sentences, and for the typical T/C sound in words such as \"ccjù\" (more) or \"cjanu\" (slow). As a transitional dialect between Sicilian and Neapolitan, Cosentian dialect shares many sounds, words and features unique to each of the Sicilian and Neapolitan groups.\n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\n\"Tutti gli esseri umani nascono liberi ed eguali in dignità e diritti.

{"id": "2077199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077199", "title": "Canterbury railway station, Sydney", "text": "Canterbury railway station, Sydney\n\nThe Canterbury railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Bankstown line at Canterbury in the City of Canterbury-Bankstown local government area of New South Wales, Australia. The station is served by Sydney Trains T3 Bankstown line services. The station was designed by New South Wales Government Railways and built from 1895 to 1915 by J. J. Scouller. It is also known as Canterbury Railway Station group. The property is owned by RailCorp (State Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nCanterbury is located on the Sydenham to Bankstown Railway which was opened as far as Belmore on 1 February 1895 the same date on which the station was opened. The line had its origins in Railway Commissioner Goodchap's 1882 recommendation that an additional line was needed between Newtown and Liverpool to relieve traffic on the Southern Line and to encourage agriculture and suburban settlement. Lobbying by local interest groups and land speculators achieved Parliamentary approval by 1890 and construction commenced in 1892. The most important stations on the line, Belmore, Canterbury and Marrickville, were built with impressive near-identical brick buildings, the other intermediate stations (Campsie, Dulwich Hill and Hurlstone Park) receiving more modest timber buildings (later replaced), possibly reflecting economies of the depression of the 1890s. The depression suppressed the profitability of the line and the extension to Liverpool did not proceed. However, suburban development followed in the early twentieth century, particularly during the interwar period when many War Service homes were built west of Canterbury. The line was extended to Bankstown in 1909 (and then to Regents Park in 1928, making it part of a loop line through Lidcombe), its justification by then being the servicing of suburban development.\n\nCanterbury Station was expanded in 1915 in conjunction with construction of the Metropolitan Goods line. To the north of the station, lie two tracks that are part of the Goods Line. The westbound line has a platform face that has been fenced off. A platform on the eastbound line was demolished in 1995. These were previously used for raceday specials when Canterbury Park Racecourse was operating. Several sidings were located just beyond the station for stabling raceday trains.\n\nCanterbury signal box was commissioned on 13 December 1915 as part of the resignalling and track alterations of Canterbury station in preparation for the opening of the new Metropolitan Goods Line from Lidcombe via Enfield Marshalling Yards to Rozelle, in April 1916. The signal box was constructed with a mechanical interlocking lever frame using 68 of the 72 possible lever positions, which controlled the operation of signals and points in a set sequence.\n\nThe signal box controlled all train movements through Canterbury on both the Bankstown suburban line and Metropolitan Goods line. Through ancillary lever frames \"B\" and \"C\", the signal box controlled the storage sidings for the Canterbury Racecourse special trains and the shunting of the local goods sidings.\n\nTwo extensions have been added to the signal box. The western annex in 1937, and the eastern annex in 1968 to provide additional space to accommodate signalling relays, circuits and equipment. In 1994 a start was made on replacing the life expired signalling system and equipment on the Bankstown line and the Metropolitan Goods line. This resulted in the closure of Canterbury signal box on the weekend of 30–31 December 1996. After its closure it was sealed in its \"as closed condition\" by the Heritage Section of the State Rail Authority to preserve the building and its internal signalling equipment. All points (switches) at Canterbury have now been removed and signals are controlled from Sydenham Signalling Complex.\n\nCanterbury is a minor station. All express services in the eastbound and westbound direction skip Canterbury. Exceptions are some morning peak eastbound services, which stop at most stations, but skip one or two.\n\nThe complex comprises two Type 11 platform buildings: Platform 1, erected in 1895, and Platform 2, erected in 1915; an Overhead Booking Office and Concourse, erected in the late 1980s; and a Signal Box erected in 1915. Other structures include Platforms 1 and 2, both completed in 1895; canopies, erected in the late 1980s; an overbridge, erected and a footbridge, erected in 1915 and later modified.\n\nCanterbury Railway Station consists of one wayside (Platform 2) on the south and one island (Platform 1) on the north, with both original platform buildings remaining. The northern side of the island platform is not used for passenger services. The wayside platform is accessed from the footbridge via a ramp, while the island platform is accessed by stairs. Even though Platform 1 has a ramp, it is not wheelchair accessible due to the ramp gradient and the three steps at the top of the ramp. An overhead booking office accessed from the Canterbury Road overbridge on the east and from Broughton Street on the north was rebuilt in the late 1980s.\n\nExternal: Rectangular polychromatic face brick building with gabled roof and surrounding cantilevered awning clad in corrugated roof sheeting. The face brick is in stretcher bond, with dark brick walls and lighter salmon coloured bricks forming a dado, framing the upper half of the windows and doors and with a diamond pattern dentil course at the high level. The building is eight bays in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick piers which coincide with the awning brackets. Original chimneys with cement mouldings and terracotta flues remain but have been painted.\n\nThe cantilever awning is on filigreed steel brackets supported on decorative cement capped brick engaged piers and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The soffit lining is the underside of the corrugated steel roof fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. There is a decorative timber moulding at junction with brick wall. The canopy returns around the western end of the building but not the eastern or stair access end. The awning edges are finished with a decorative timber boarded valance.\n\nThe external walls rise from a projecting brick plinth (now painted) with a decorative two part cement dado moulding which frames the salmon brick dado and is continuous between door and window openings. Decorative cement window and door frames rise above the dado moulding, each with a decorative keystone.\n\nThe original window and door openings have segmental arches and the windows feature a decorative moulded cement sill. The original timber windows were double hung with a double paned lower sash and a multi-paned upper sash featuring coloured glass. Much of the original coloured window glass remains as well as the original fanlights above the door openings. The doors were timber panelled.\n\nThe end brick gables feature a louvre within a round brisk window frames in salmon coloured voussoir shaped bricks with four cement keystones.\n\nInternal: The building comprises a booking hall entered by a set of double doors at the bottom of the stairs; a booking office; station masters room; general waiting room; ladies waiting room and ladies toilet, a lamp room and men's toilet. The internal usage has now changed, and the toilets have modern fitouts. All of these facilities are now closed to the public. Passengers are directed to use a public toilet just outside the station on Broughton St at the bus terminus.\n\nExternal: Rectangular face brick building with gabled corrugated steel roof and integral shallower sloped cantilevered awning. The face brick is in stretcher bond. The building is four bays in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick piers which coincide with the awning supports. The original chimney with cement mouldings and terracotta flue remains.\n\nThe cantilever awning is on standard double bowed steel brackets supported on decorative cement haunches and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The soffit lining is the underside of the corrugated steel roofing fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. There is a decorative timber moulding at junction with brick wall. Vertical timber boards form valances at each end of awning.\n\nThe external walls rise from a projecting brick plinth three/four courses high with a decorative dado moulding run in cement which is continuous between door and window openings. Decorative cement window and door frames rise above the dado moulding.\n\nThe original window openings feature a moulded cement sill with a scalloped fringe. The original timber windows were double hung with a single paned lower sash and a six paned upper sash featuring coloured glass, with glass louvres in the toilet windows. The original window glass as well as the upper glazing bars has been removed from all but one window. Original door openings featured fanlights matching the upper window sashes. All the original timber panelled doors have been removed.\n\nInternal: The building comprises a general waiting room; ladies room and ladies toilets and men's toilets. The internal usage has now changed and the toilets have modern fitouts and finishes. The waiting room and ladies room have original ripple iron ceiling, ceiling rose and plaster wall finishes.\n\nThe original timber clad overhead booking office has been demolished and replaced by a new steel framed metal hipped roof structure. This building is used as the station office, as well as housing a small shop.\n\nExternal: Canterbury signal box is located beside the Bankstown suburban line, in the Canterbury Station precinct. It is a two-storey timber framed structure clad in \"checked and chamfered\" weather boards. It has a hipped, galvanised corrugated iron roof with wide eaves on all sides. The first floor (or operating level) has wood framed, sliding windows on three sides with a blank rear wall. On the eastern end of the building there is a landing, incorporating an enclosed toilet. The landing extends past the front of the building over a public walkway to a flight of metal stairs. The ground floor incorporates the interlocking room and relay room. The interlocking room has four windows in the front wall. In the rear is the relay room, featuring four windows in the rear wall. The eastern extension is flat roofed and is constructed of precast concrete panels between exposed verticals simulating timber weatherboards. There is one door at the eastern end of this extension (2009).\n\nInternal: The interior walls and ceiling of the first floor are lined with wall boards, and the timber floor is covered in linoleum. On the ground floor, the interlocking room is unlined, and the long and narrow lined relay room houses signalling relays which control the operation of signalling circuits.\n\nPlatform 1 has an asphalt surface with its original brick face and a concrete edge. The northern or \"goods\" side of this platform is constructed in the same manner. Platform 2 also has its original brick face with a concrete edge.\n\nHaunched beam design consists of tapered cantilevers bearing on platform trestles and brick piers on each side support shallow beams over the railway tracks. The footbridge has been modified at a later unknown date.\n\nThe overbridge consists of steel girders supporting a jack arched brick and concrete deck. The girders span the Up and Down lines supported on concrete and brick abutment walls. The parapet walls are brick.\n\nNew steel framed and metal roof clad canopies have been erected over the access stairs to the island platform and at the eastern end of the wayside station building, as well as the access ramp.\n\nThe platform buildings are generally in good condition. The overhead booking office is in good condition. The Signal Box exterior is in reasonably good condition with some peeling of paint. A fire caused some internal damage to the rear wall and ceiling of the operating level and there is evidence of past white ant activity. The platforms are generally in good condition. and in good condition are both the over bridge and the canopies. When the signal box was closed in 1996 the Heritage Section of former State Rail Authority had the building sealed in its final operating state. This action had the effect of maintaining the signal box in its as closed condition, preserving the mechanical interlocking lever frame and associated signalling equipment in a complete condition and it is therefore of high integrity. The footbridge retains its original haunched beam structure but has a new concrete floor, new balustrades and canopy cover. The access stairs to Platform 1 are modern. The overbridge retains all of its original steel beams and jack arches as well as the brick abutments, piers and parapet walls.\n\nExternally, the station building retains most of the original detailing. Some windows have been modified by the insertion of fibreglass vandal-proof sheeting into the sashes, but a number of windows and fanlights retain the coloured glazing. Original roof vents have been removed, and the face brick chimneys painted. The male toilet modesty screen has been removed and three external doors have been replaced by flush doors. Internally, although the toilets have modern fixtures, a substantial amount of the original finishes remain. This includes plaster wall finishes, plaster ceilings and cornices, ceiling roses, the ticket window framing in the booking hall, benches and cupboards in the booking office.\n\nExternally the station building retains most of the original detailing. Some windows have been modified by the insertion of fibreglass vandal-proof sheeting into the sashes, but a number of windows retain the coloured glazing, especially on the rear side.

Internally, although the toilets have modern fixtures, a substantial amount of the original finishes remain. This includes plaster wall finishes, plaster ceilings, cornices, and ceiling roses. The female toilet retains the early partitions, but with new fixtures. The original mantelpiece remains in the waiting room but the fireplace is gone.\n\nThe station has been modified since its establishment in 1895 as follows:\n\nTransit Systems operate five routes via Canterbury station:\n\nAs at 18 November 2010, Canterbury Railway Station possesses historical significance as it is a station on the Sydenham to Bankstown Line which was constructed to relieve congestion on the Main South Line as well as to encourage suburban development and the growth of agriculture in the late 19th and early 20th century. The main platform building represents the period of transition from the boom time of the 1880s to the standardisation of NSW railway building design from the 1890s onwards.\n\nCanterbury Railway Station is significant at the state level as the Platform 1 Building demonstrates the high level of aesthetic design of the pre-1900 standard railway buildings, which included the use of polychromatic brickwork, decorative dentil coursing, ornate awning brackets and carved bargeboards. This platform building is relatively intact and is representative of a small group of such ornate platform buildings including Marrickville and Belmore on the Bankstown Line.\n\nThe Canterbury signal box is of historical significance as it is representative of the development of railway signalling technology in the first decades of the 20th century. As it was is intact internally it is capable of providing information about the workings of a signal box of this era.\n\nCanterbury railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nCanterbury Railway Station has historical significance as it is one of the railway stations on the Sydenham to Bankstown Line built to relieve the crowding on the Main Southern Line and encourage agriculture and suburban growth in the late 1800s and early 20th century. The brick building on Platform 1 represents that period which marked the transition from the boom period of the 1880s to the standardisation of NSW Railways building design of the 1890s and onwards.

The processes used to decide the absolute structure use the anomalous dispersion effect. If atomic scattering factors did not have imaginary parts, the Friedel pairs would have exactly the same amplitudes (i.e., the scattering intensity formula_1 from crystal plane (h k l) is equal to formula_2). However, atomic scattering factors have imaginary parts due to the anomalous dispersion effect, and Friedel's law is broken by this effect.\n\nThere are several ways to determine the absolute structure by X-ray crystallography. For example, a comparison of the intensities of Bijvoet pairs or of the R-factors for the two possible structures can suggest the correct absolute structure. One of the more powerful and simple approaches is using the Flack parameter, because this single parameter clearly indicates the absolute structure.\n\nThe Flack parameter is calculated during the structural refinement using the equation given below:\n\nwhere \"x\" is the Flack parameter, \"I\" is the square of the scaled observed structure factor and \"F\" is the calculated structure factor.\n\nBy determining \"x\" for all data, \"x\" is usually found to be between 0 and 1. If the value is near 0, with a small standard uncertainty, the absolute structure given by the structure refinement is likely correct, and if the value is near 1, then the inverted structure is likely correct. If the value is near 0.5, the crystal may be racemic or twinned. The technique is most effective when the crystal contains both lighter and heavier atoms. Light atoms usually show only a small anomalous dispersion effect. In this case, the Flack parameter can refine to a physically unrealistic value (less than 0 or greater than 1) and has no meaning.\n\nThis parameter, introduced by H. D.

He was a victim of the mass killing of Bengali intellectuals in 1971. He was awarded Independence Day Award in 1980, by the then President Ziaur Rahman's government, posthumously.\n\nChoudhury's ancestors were originated from Noakhali. He was born on 27 November 1925 in Manikganj. His father was Khan Bahadur Abdul Halim Chowdhury, a district magistrate and Aligarh Muslim University graduate. His mother was Umme Kabir Afia Begum (d. 2000). Because of his father's official assignment, Choudhury lived in Manikganj, Pirojpur and other parts of East Bengal. The family moved to Dhaka permanently in 1936. Then he grew up in the residence \"Darul Afia\", named after her mother, among 14 siblings. He completed his matriculation from Dhaka Collegiate School in 1941 and intermediate examination from Aligarh Muslim University. He then studied English literature for his bachelor's degree (with honours) in 1946 and master's in 1947 at the University of Dhaka. He was expelled from Salimullah Hall, his residential dorm, because of his involvement in leftist politics. He was imprisoned for two years in 1952 for his participation in the Bengali Language Movement. While in jail, in 1954, he appeared at the master's examination in Bengali literature and stood first in the first class. Later, in 1958, he obtained his third master's degree in linguistics from Harvard University.\n\nIn 1947, Choudhury started his career in teaching at Brajalal College in Khulna. He moved to Jagannath College in Dhaka in 1950. He joined the University of Dhaka in 1950 and taught both in the departments of English and Bengali until 1971. He became reader in 1962 and professor in 1970 and the dean of the faculty of arts in 1971.\n\nChoudhury was associated with leftist politics and progressive cultural movements. In 1948, he attended the Communist Party Conference in Kolkata. He was elected Secretary of the \"\"Pragati Lekhak O Shilpi Sangha\"\" (Progressive Writers and Artists Association). In 1952, he was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act for protesting against police repression and the killing of students on the Language Movement. In 1967, he protested the Pakistan government's ban on Tagore songs on radio and television. In the early 1950s, there was a movement in Pakistan to replace the Bengali language alphabet with the Arabic alphabet. As a linguist and writer, Choudhury protested this move to undermine the native language of East Pakistan. He actively participated in the non-co-operation movement during the early part of 1971 and renounced his award \"Sitara-e-Imtiaz\", awarded by the Government of Pakistan in 1966.\n\nDuring his imprisonment in 1952-54, he wrote his symbolic drama on the historic language movement, \"Kabar\" (The Grave). He continued to write after being freed from prison, some of his notable works being \"Roktakto Prantor\" (1959; a play about the Third Battle of Panipat), \"Chithi\" (1966) and \"Polashi Barrack O Onyanno\" (1969). In 1965, Choudhury redesigned the keyboard of the Bangla typewriter, named \"Munier Optima Keyboard\" in collaboration with Remington typewriters of the then East Germany.\n\n\n\nAfter the Pakistani army crackdown in 1971 in the University of Dhaka area from which Chowdhury escaped like many, he moved to his parents' house, near Hatirpool. On 14 December 1971, he, along with a large number of Bengali intellectuals, educators, doctors and engineers, were kidnapped from their houses and later tortured and executed by the Pakistan Army and its Bengali collaborators Al-Badr and Al-Shams. According to a witness, Choudhury was last seen in Physical Training College in Mohammadpur Thana, Dhaka where his fingers were mutilated. His dead body could not be identified.\n\nOn 18 July 2013, Asif Munier Chowdhury Tonmoy, a son of Choudhury, made the statement before the International Crimes Tribunal-2. According to his testimony, Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin, a Muslim leader based in London, and Ashrafuz Zaman Khan, based in the United States, were directly involved in abduction, forced disappearance and killing of Choudhury. On 3 November the same year, both of them were sentenced in absentia after the court found that they were involved in the abduction and murders of 18 people – nine Dhaka University teachers including Choudhury, six journalists and three physicians – in December 1971.\n\nChoudhury was married to Lily Choudhury. Together they had three sons, Ahmed Munier, Ashfaque Munier (Mishuk) and Asif Munier. Ashfaq was a cinematographer. Ahmed is retired and previously worked for UN missions in Africa. Asif is a human rights activist and works in the development sector. He was a founder member of \"Projonmo Ekattor\", a human rights group.\n\nChoudhury's notable siblings include actress Ferdousi Mazumder, National Professor Kabir Chowdhury (d. 2011), columnist Shamsher Choudhury (d. 2012) and language activist Nadera Begum (d. 2013).\n\nSince 1989, a Bangladeshi theater troupe named \"Theatre\" has been conferring theater personalities for their contribution to the performing art form with \"Munier Chowdhury Shammanona\" award. Bangla Academy confers \"Shaheed Munier Choudhury Memorial Award\" to book publishing houses for the merit of quality of printing and aesthetic values. Central Road, the street in Dhaka where Choudhury lived, was renamed to \"Shaheed Munier Chowdhury Road\". In 1991, on the 20th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence, the government issued a commemorative stamp featuring Choudhury.\n"}

{"id": "2077264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077264", "title": "Elephant joke", "text": "Elephant joke\n\nAn elephant joke is a joke, almost always an absurd riddle or conundrum and often a sequence of such, that involves an elephant. Elephant jokes were a fad in the 1960s, with many people constructing large numbers of them according to a set formula. Sometimes they involve parodies or puns.\n\nExamples of elephant jokes are:\n\nIn 1960, L.M. Becker Co of Appleton, Wisconsin, released a set of 50 trading cards titled \"Elephant Jokes\". Elephant jokes first appeared in the United States in 1962. They were first recorded in mid-1962 in Texas, and gradually spread across the US, reaching California in early 1963. By July 1963, elephant jokes were ubiquitous and could be found in newspaper columns, and in \"Time\" and \"Seventeen\" magazines, with millions of people working to construct more jokes according to the same formula.\n\nBoth elephant jokes and Tom Swifties were in vogue in 1963, and were reported in the US national press. While Tom Swifties were marketed to literate adults and gradually fell out of fashion over subsequent decades, elephant jokes have lasted among younger audiences, circulating through generations of schoolchildren. \n\nProlific science fiction writer Isaac Asimov was of the opinion that these jokes are \"favorites of youngsters and of unsophisticated adults\". However, he finds one joke uncharacteristically sophisticated enough to include in his book of favorite jokes. The joke was told in the aftermath of the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby, who had walked into Dallas police headquarters carrying a gun:\n\nElephant jokes rely upon absurdity and incongruity for their humor, and a contrast with the normal presumptions of knowledge about elephants. They rely upon absurdist reasoning such as that it would be the relatively incidental evidence regarding the smell of an elephant's breath or the presence of footprints in the butter that would allow for the detection of an elephant in one's bathtub or refrigerator. One key to the construction of an elephant joke is that the joke answers are somewhat appropriate if one merely overlooks the obvious absurdities inherent to the questions. If elephants were capable of climbing trees and if painting an elephant's toenails was an effective camouflage mechanism, then red \"would\" be the appropriate color for a cherry tree. If the common connotation that questions requesting the time are expected to be answered in terms of hours and minutes is ignored, then by the implied destruction of one's fence from being sat on by an elephant, it \"would\" be time to build a new fence. The appropriateness of the answer, when accounting for the absurd incongruences existing between the implied premise of the question and the normal assumptions said question invokes, distinguishes elephant jokes as jokes rather than nonsensical riddles.\n\nElephant jokes are often parodies of conventional children's riddles. Consider the following commonly recited child's riddle: \nTraditionally the challenge of solving this riddle relies on recognizing the ambiguity stemming from the riddle being generally shared aloud as opposed to in writing. Thus the appropriate homophone, \"red\" or \"read\", must be inferred. If \"red\" is assumed, then the problem arises regarding whether or not any object satisfying the condition of being \"red all over\" would necessarily preclude said object from also satisfying the requirement of being \"black and white\". However, if instead \"read\" is assumed, then there is no implied mutual exclusivity preventing a solution, conventionally a newspaper, from satisfying both required conditions. Compare the traditional riddle, which is solved by a well-known item that can be reasonably determined from the riddle, with the elephant joke parody:\nThe absurdity of an elephant wearing a nun costume makes it nearly impossible for anyone not familiar with the punchline to independently think of the parody answer. Ignoring how unlikely one is to ever encounter an elephant dressed as a nun, then the answer is somewhat appropriate. A nun costume \"would\" likely be both \"black and white\" and a sunburn \"would\" cause an elephant to be, somewhat, \"red all over\". Humor arises from the irony of ignoring the expected answer for the outlandish, yet appropriate, elephant answer.\n\nA turnabout to the \"Blind men and an elephant\" parable is a joke about four blind elephants who feel a human. The first reports that humans are flat, and the other three agree.\nA series of elephant jokes can be constructed. Linking the appropriateness of each subsequent answer to the logically absurd structure of the preceding joke, the overall absurdity of a series can continuously compound. For example:\n\nThe absurdity of the first riddle's answer subverts the audience's initial expectations. The second and third riddles reinforce the expectation for this logically absurd structure. The final riddle concludes by again absurdly subverting the audience's expected framework. The humor for independent elephant jokes relies on absurd answers that ignore expectations, yet have a certain appropriateness. Here the absurdity is compounded when the appropriateness of the final riddle's answer is dependent upon undermining the logically absurd structure built from the preceding riddles. \n\nOne short example involves a displacement of a concept from one animal's features to those of an elephant, in terms of function:\n\nIn another example:\n\nElephant jokes thus not only deliberately undermine the conventions of riddles, they even act to undermine themselves. This even extends to undermining the implied premise, expected by those that are familiar with elephant jokes, that an elephant joke is automatically illogical, or even involves elephants at all. For example:\n\nThere can even be an off-color tinge:\nOne time Gong Show act Mike Elephant is remembered for the following joke:\n\nSome may be regional:\n\nElephant jokes can also use their inherent absurdity to point up the inherent absurdity in some current events. One such joke from the early 1960s refers to an incident in President Kennedy's on-again-off-again support for Cuban exiles' attempts to overthrow Fidel Castro:\n\nElephant jokes are seen by many commentators as symbolic of the culture of the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1960s. Elliott Oring notes that elephant jokes dismiss conventional questions and answers, repudiate established wisdom, and reject the authority of traditional knowledge. He draws a parallel between this and the counterculture of the 1960s, stating that \"\"disestablishment\" was the purpose of both,\" pointing to the sexual revolution and noting that \"[p]erhaps it was no accident that many of the elephant jokes emphasized the intrusion of sex into the most innocuous areas.\"\n\nIn their paper, \"On elephantasy and elephanticide\", Abrahams and Dundes consider elephant jokes to be convenient disguises for racism, and symbolised the nervousness of white people about the civil rights movement. Whilst blatantly racialist jokes became less acceptable, elephant jokes were a useful proxy. One example Abrahams and Dundes provide is the joke:\nThey state that the \"big and grey and comes in quarts\" is in fact a reference \"to the supposed mammoth nature of black sexuality.\" Similarly, the joke about an elephant in the bathtub is argued to be a reference to the increased intrusion of black people into \"the most intimate areas of white life.\"\n\nOring strongly disagrees with this view, writing: \"The Civil Rights movement, of course, was an integral part of the countercultural revolution. But there is no reason to view it as the single force conditioning the joke cycle. Much more than the relations between the races was being turned on its ear. Reducing elephant jokes to a mere front for racial aggression, it seems to me, not only misses the larger sense of what the jokes are about, but the larger sense of what was going on in the society at the time.\" and continuing: \"Elephant joking is more than a description of the episodic career of an animal with a phallic nose. What engenders the humor in such jokes is the violation of categories of expectation, and not images of subjugation, degradation, or feminization of the elephant.\"\n\nCharles Gruner agrees with Oring that Abrahams' and Dundes' explanation (that \"the elephant is an ambivalent father figure\" that is, in reality, \"the black man (perceived as a sexual threat) that stands hidden behind the image of the elephant\") is an \"explanation from Freudian Monsterland [that] holds no water.\"\n\nGruner however disagrees with Oring about the chronological topicality of the elephant joke and its relation to social upheavals, arguing from personal experience of \"one of the best motion picture sight gags in history\", where Jimmy Durante in the 1962 movie \"Billy Rose's Jumbo\" is attempting to sneak an elephant unseen through a circus. Upon coming around a tent and being faced with a crowd of people and a policeman who demands \"Where do you think you are you going with that elephant?\" Durante backs against the elephant, arms wide, and asks, innocently, \"What elephant?\" Gunder proposes that the success of this sight gag spawned in comic writers the idea of \"hiding the elephant by all sorts of ridiculous means,\" and thus, by extension to \"other silly, stupid comparisons\", the whole genre of elephant jokes.\n\n\n"}

It grows up to tall. In Japan, where the tree is called \"kusunoki\", five camphor trees are known with a trunk circumference above , with the largest individual, , reaching 24.22 m.\n\nThe leaves have a glossy, waxy appearance and smell of camphor when crushed. In spring, it produces bright green foliage with masses of small white flowers. It produces clusters of black, berry-like fruit around in diameter. Its pale bark is very rough and fissured vertically.\n\n\"C. camphora\" is cultivated for camphor and timber production. The production and shipment of camphor, in a solid, waxy form, was a major industry in Taiwan prior to and during the Japanese colonial era (1895–1945). It was used medicinally and was also an important ingredient in the production of smokeless gunpowder and celluloid. Primitive stills were set up in the mountainous areas in which the tree is usually found. The wood was chipped; these chips were steamed in a retort, allowing the camphor to crystallize on the inside of a crystallization box after the vapour had passed through a cooling chamber. It was then scraped off and packed out to government-run factories for processing and sale. Camphor was one of the most lucrative of several important government monopolies under the Japanese.\n\nThe wood has an insect-repellent quality.\n\nCamphor is a white crystalline substance, obtained from the tree \"C. camphora\". Camphor has been used for many centuries as a culinary spice, a component of incense, and as a medicine. It is also an insect repellent and a flea-killing substance.\n\nThe species contains volatile chemical compounds in all plant parts, and the wood and leaves are steam distilled for the essential oils. Camphor laurel has six different chemical variants called chemotypes, which are camphor, linalool, 1,8-cineole, nerolidol, safrole, and borneol. In China, field workers avoid mixing chemotypes when harvesting by their odour. The cineole fraction of camphor laurel is used in China to manufacture fake \"eucalyptus oil\".\n\nThe chemical variants (or chemotypes) seem dependent upon the country of origin of the tree. e.g., \"C. camphora\" grown in Taiwan and Japan is normally very high in linalool, often between 80 and 85%. In India and Sri Lanka, the high camphor variety/chemotype remains dominant. \"C. camphora\" grown in Madagascar, though, is high in 1,8-cineole (averaging between 40 and 50%). The essential oil from the Madagascar trees is commercially known as \"ravintsara\".\n\nCamphor laurel was introduced to Australia in 1822 as an ornamental tree for use in gardens and public parks. It has become a noxious weed throughout Queensland and central to northern New South Wales, where it is suited to the wet, subtropical climate. However, the tree provides hollows quickly in younger trees, whereas natives can take hundreds of years to develop hollows. The camphor content of the leaf litter helps prevent other plants from germinating successfully, helping to ensure the camphor's success against any potentially competing vegetation, and the seeds are attractive to birds and pass intact through the digestive system, ensuring rapid distribution. Camphor laurel invades rainforests and pastures, and also competes against eucalyptus trees, certain species of which are the sole food source of koalas.\n\nIntroduced to the contiguous United States around 1875, \"C. camphora\" has become naturalized in portions of Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas, and South Carolina. It has been declared a category I invasive species in Florida.\n\nIn Australia, two native Lepidoptera insects, the purple brown-eye and common red-eye, larval stages feed on camphor despite it being an introduced plant.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2077273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077273", "title": "Vidya Balan", "text": "Vidya Balan\n\nVidya Balan (pronounced ; born 1 January 1979) is an Indian actress. Known for pioneering a change in the portrayal of women in Hindi cinema with her roles in female-led films, she is the recipient of several awards, including a National Film Award and six Filmfare Awards. She was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2014.\n\nVidya aspired to a career in film from a young age and had her first acting role in the 1995 sitcom \"Hum Paanch\". While pursuing a master's degree in sociology from the University of Mumbai, she made several unsuccessful attempts to start a career in film, and featured in television commercials and music videos. She made her film debut by starring in the Bengali film \"Bhalo Theko\" and received praise for her first Hindi film, the drama \"Parineeta\". This was followed by commercial successes in \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\" (2006) and \"Bhool Bhulaiyaa\" (2007), but her roles in the romantic comedies \"Heyy Babyy\" (2007) and \"Kismat Konnection\" (2008) had negative reviews. \n\nVidya went on to establish herself by starring in five consecutive commercial successes, which also earned her critical and awards recognition. These were in the drama \"Paa\" (2009), the black comedy \"Ishqiya\" (2010), the thrillers \"No One Killed Jessica\" and \"Kahaani\" (2012), and the biopic \"The Dirty Picture\" (2011). The last of these won her the National Film Award for Best Actress. She followed this with a series of films that performed poorly at the box office. This changed when she starred as a radio jockey in \"Tumhari Sulu\" (2017) and a scientist in \"Mission Mangal\" (2019). The latter ranks as her highest-grossing release.\n\nVidya also promotes humanitarian causes and supports the empowerment of women. She is a member of the Indian Central Board of Film Certification and hosts a radio show. She initially drew criticism for her fluctuating weight and dress sense, but was later credited in the media for her unconventionality. Vidya is married to the film producer Siddharth Roy Kapur.\n\nVidya was born on 1 January 1979 in Bombay (present-day Mumbai), to parents of Tamilian descent. Her father, P. R. Balan, is the executive vice-president of Digicable and her mother, Saraswathy Balan, is a homemaker. According to Vidya, they speak a mix of Tamil and Malayalam at home. Her elder sister, Priya Balan, works in advertising. The actress Priyamani is her second cousin.\n\nVidya grew up in the suburban neighbourhood of Chembur, Mumbai and attended St. Anthony Girls' High School. From a young age, she aspired to a career in film and was inspired by the work of actors Shabana Azmi and Madhuri Dixit. At the age of 16, she starred in the first season of Ekta Kapoor's sitcom \"Hum Paanch\" as Radhika, a bespectacled teenager. After the series ended, Vidya refused director Anurag Basu's offer to star in a television soap opera, as she wanted to concentrate on a film career. Her parents were supportive of the decision but encouraged her to complete her education first. She attended St. Xavier's College to pursue a bachelor's degree in sociology and later earned a master's degree from the University of Mumbai.\n\nWhile pursuing her master's degree, Vidya was cast as the female lead in the Malayalam film \"Chakram\", opposite Mohanlal and was subsequently signed on for 12 other Malayalam language films. However, due to production difficulties, \"Chakram\" was shelved. The postponement of a film starring Mohanlal was an unheard occurrence in Malayalam cinema and producers blamed Vidya for bringing \"bad luck\" to the project; labelled her as a \"jinx\"; and replaced her in the films that she had been contracted for. She shifted focus to Tamil cinema. In 2001, she was cast as the female lead in N. Linguswamy's \"Run\" (2002). However, after completing the first shooting schedule, she was unceremoniously dropped and replaced by Meera Jasmine. She was signed up under false pretences for a sex comedy, a genre she was uncomfortable with, and decided to leave the project. Thereafter, she signed on for a third Tamil film, \"Manasellam\" (2003), but was replaced by Trisha as the director was dissatisfied with her work. \"Kalari Vikraman\", another Malayalam film that she completed work for in 2003, failed to get a theatrical release. After failing to start a film career, Vidya appeared in approximately 60 television commercials and in music videos for Euphoria and Shubha Mudgal; a majority of these were directed by Pradeep Sarkar.\n\nVidya's film debut came with the Bengali film \"Bhalo Theko\" (2003), a drama directed by Goutam Halder. He cast her in the lead role of Aanandi, a young woman reminiscing about her past, for the combination of innocence and experience that he found in her. Vidya was pleased to work in a Bengali film, saying that her exposure to cinema had largely been driven by the industry. Her performance earned Vidya an Anandalok Purashkar for Best Actress. On Pradeep Sarkar's recommendation, Vidya auditioned for a leading role in his directorial venture the Hindi film \"Parineeta\". The film's producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra preferred the casting of an established actress, but agreed to cast Vidya after she underwent six months of extensive tests. \"Parineeta\", based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name, was released in 2005, and is about the love story between a zamindar's son (played by Saif Ali Khan) and their tenant's daughter (Vidya). Vidya's performance received praise from critics; Derek Elley of \"Variety\" found her to be an \"acting revelation\", adding that her \"devoted but dignified Lalita is the picture's heart and soul\". At the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony, she won Best Female Debut and received a nomination for Best Actress. \n\nContinuing her collaboration with Chopra's company, Vidya starred opposite Sanjay Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's comedy film \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\" (2006). She played a radio jockey who served as the love interest of the title character, for which she met with a couple of radio jockeys and watched them at work. She has said that despite not having a \"great role\", she agreed to the project in an effort to work in different genres to avoid typecasting in her \"Parineeta\" image. With earnings of , \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\" emerged as one of the highest-grossing Hindi films to that point. Vidya began 2007 by agreeing to the supporting role of a multiple sclerosis patient in Mani Ratnam's drama \"Guru\", starring Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai, due to her desire to work with Ratnam. Raja Sen of Rediff.com bemoaned that she was \"somewhat wasted in a role that isn't as well-etched\". Her next two roles, in the ensemble films \"Salaam-e-Ishq\" and \"\", were also small. She defended these choices by saying that \"they were all part of my learning curve\". Both films performed poorly at the box office, but the latter was selected as India's entry for the 80th Academy Awards. Citing date issues, Vidya refused Pradeep Sarkar and Sudhir Mishra's offers to star in their films \"Laaga Chunari Mein Daag\" and \"Khoya Khoya Chand\", respectively; she has said that both filmmakers were upset with her decision.\n\nIn her next release of 2007, the comedy \"Heyy Babyy\", co-starring Akshay Kumar, Ritesh Deshmukh, and Fardeen Khan, Vidya performed a glamorous, westernised role for the first time. Her look was poorly received, with Namrata Joshi of \"Outlook\" writing, \"Vidya is irritating, over-the-top, extremely affected and looks ghastly in figure-hugging frocks.\" She next teamed with Kumar once again in \"Bhool Bhulaiyaa\", a comedy horror film from Priyadarshan, which served as a remake of the Malayalam film \"Manichitrathazhu\" (1993). Played by Shobana in the original, Vidya was challenged by the role of a woman suffering from dissociative identity disorder; in preparation, she stayed in isolation for three days and once collapsed on set. She was also intimidated by the dancing that her role required and began learning kathak days before filming her scenes. Despite disliking the film and Vidya's dancing, Khalid Mohamed described her as \"bankably likeable\", and Taran Adarsh labelled her as \"splendid\". Both \"Heyy Babyy\" and \"Bhool Bhulaiyaa\" were among the highest-grossing Hindi films of the year. The latter also earned her another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.\n\nIn 2008's \"Halla Bol\", based on the life of activist Safdar Hashmi, Vidya played a supporting role opposite Ajay Devgn. She next took on a glamorous role once again in the romantic comedy \"Kismat Konnection\", co-starring Shahid Kapoor. She said that she deliberately chose the part to move away from her comfort zone, but she found it difficult to dance alongside Kapoor. Elvis D'Silva of Rediff.com dismissed Vidya as \"woefully miscast\" and criticised her look and wardrobe, as did Shubhra Gupta of \"The Indian Express\", who termed her \"determinedly frumpy\". Both films had poor box office returns. Addressing her failure in portraying glamorous roles, Vidya has said that such parts did not suit her personality and blamed herself for \"a complete lack of conviction on my part\".\n\nVidya's career prospects improved in 2009 when R. Balki cast her in his comedy-drama \"Paa\". She played a single mother struggling with her son's (played by Amitabh Bachchan) progeria. She was initially skeptical to take on the part, wondering if she could be maternal towards an actor of Bachchan's stature, who was over 30 years her senior. After insisting on a look test with Bachchan, she said that the actor's effective transformation into a young boy convinced her to accept the part. Comparing her acting style to that of Dimple Kapadia, the critic Sukanya Verma wrote, \"Balan is poignant yet restrained and projects an impressive figure of grace and integrity\"; Nikhat Kazmi of \"The Times of India\" commended her for lending a \"rare dignity to the image of the Bollywood mom\". \"Paa\" was a commercial success, and won Vidya the Filmfare Award and Screen Award for Best Actress. Vidya has said that the film's reception gave her \"courage to stick to my conviction\".\n\nVidya described her next role, in Abhishek Chaubey's black comedy \"Ishqiya\" (2010), to be \"an epitome of grey\". The film starred her as a seductive, manipulative widow, which marked a departure from her wholesome on-screen persona. Set in a village in Uttar Pradesh, the part required her to undergo training to speak the local dialect, which also involved the use of profanity. Anupama Chopra opined, \"Vidya Balan's smoldering looks scorch the screen even as her eyes hint at tragedy. She proves that she is miles ahead of the cookie cutter Barbie dolls that clutter Bollywood and that sensuality has very little to do with showing skin.\" Vidya's work won her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, a second consecutive Best Actress award at Screen, and a nomination for Best Actress at Filmfare.\n\nThe year 2011 marked a high point in Vidya's career, as she had starring roles in two commercially successful female-led films. In \"No One Killed Jessica\" (2011), a thriller based on the murder of Jessica Lal, and co-starring Rani Mukerji, Vidya played the real-life character of Sabrina, who seeks justice for her sister's murder. Vidya was styled in men's dresses and loose-fitted clothing; several scenes were shot on location using hidden cameras, and she was pleased with the anonymity that her styling provided. She also enjoyed working with Mukerji, remarking that two leading ladies starring together was rare in Hindi film. Sudhish Kamath of \"The Hindu\" took note of Vidya's ability to be \"in sublime control over her emotions\" and Savera Someshwar of Rediff.com added that \"her hesitant body language, her faith, her helplessness, her rage, her sorrow and her gratitude all come across beautifully\". Vidya earned another Filmfare nomination for Best Actress. In the same year, she made a guest appearance in the Malayalam film \"Urumi\" and a retrospective of her films was held in Australia as part of the Bollywood and Beyond festival.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that with her role in \"The Dirty Picture\" (2011), a drama based on the controversial Indian actress Silk Smitha, Vidya had \"redefine[d] the Hindi film heroine\". She was challenged by the overwhelming sexuality in the role, and has said that it required a lot of mental preparation to maintain a balance between her character's innocence, vulnerability, and sex appeal. She also gained to look the part. Khalid Mohamed observed of Vidya, \"She's extraordinary: gutsy, consistently in character and unafraid of exposing her darker side. Here's the kind of complex performance which you haven't evidenced in years and years.\" With worldwide earnings of , \"The Dirty Picture\" emerged as Hindi cinema's highest-grossing female-led film to that point. Vidya won another Filmfare and Screen Award, in addition to the National Film Award for Best Actress.\n\nVidya next starred in the thriller \"Kahaani\" (2012), directed by Sujoy Ghosh. Set in Kolkata during the Durga Puja festivities, it starred her as a pregnant woman in search of her missing husband. Made on a shoestring budget, the film was shot over 64 days in the streets of Kolkata by employing guerrilla filmmaking. While promoting the film, Vidya drew media attention for wearing a prosthetic belly. Pratim D. Gupta of \"The Telegraph\" wrote that Vidya \"gets into the physicality of a pregnant woman with unfailing mastery\". Sanjukta Sharma of \"Mint\" summarised, \"Balan’s existence, and indeed her flourishing, says something about the Hindi film industry finally breaking away from the “heroine\" mould.\" As with \"The Dirty Picture\", \"Kahaani\" too emerged among the biggest earning female-led Hindi films, grossing over worldwide. Vidya won a fourth consecutive Best Actress Award at Screen and a third Best Actress Award at Filmfare.\n\nAfter serving as a jury member at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, Vidya starred in the comic thriller \"Ghanchakkar\" (2013). Playing a boisterous Punjabi woman opposite Emraan Hashmi, she explained that unlike her previous few films, her part in it was secondary to the male star. Sarit Ray of \"Hindustan Times\" dismissed her \"shrill, garish-dressing, magazine-devouring Punjabi housewife\" character as \"caricature-ish\". Vidya then provided the voice of Draupadi for \"Mahabharat\", an animation film based on the Indian epic of the same name. She began 2014 with \"Shaadi Ke Side Effects\", a romantic comedy about a married couple, in which she was pitted opposite Farhan Akhtar. Critics liked their chemistry, but were unimpressed with the film. She was next drawn to the title role of an aspiring detective in the comedy-mystery film \"Bobby Jasoos\", after connecting with the character's struggle to prove herself. It required her to sport 12 elaborate disguises, and she trained with a language coach to adopt a Hyderabadi accent. Rohit Khilnani of \"India Today\" was appreciative of Vidya's performance but disliked the film's script and execution. All of these films were commercially unsuccessful, which led Vidya to admit that she felt \"devastated\" by their reception.\n\nThe series of poorly received films continued with the romantic drama \"Hamari Adhuri Kahani\" (2015). The writer Mahesh Bhatt, who based the film on his own mother, was keen to have Vidya play the lead role of a domestic abuse survivor. Shubha Shetty-Saha of \"Mid Day\" bemoaned that she had been \"saddled with a boring, outdated, weepy character\" and that \"there was nothing much even she could do\". The following year, she took on the supporting part of a police officer in \"Te3n\" (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film \"Montage\", co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She was drawn to playing a woman who commands respect and identified with her \"silent aggression\". Rajeev Masand criticised the film's predictable denouement, but liked Vidya's ability to act through gestures. She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for \"Ekk Albela\", a Marathi-language biopic of Bhagwan Dada. Journalists speculated if \"\" (2016), a spiritual sequel to \"Kahaani\", would help overcome her career decline. It was not as well-received as the first film, but Vidya received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her portrayal of a child sexual abuse survivor. In a mixed review of the film, Raja Sen of Rediff.com wrote that \"with tremendous commitment to the part, [Vidya] gives us a stirring performance free of vanity or obviousness\".\n\nIn Srijit Mukherji's period drama \"Begum Jaan\" (2017), a remake of the filmmaker's own Bengali film \"Rajkahini\" (2015), Vidya played the title role of a procurer from the 1940s. She worked with Mukherji to provide a backstory to her character and researched the era by reading \"The Other Side of Silence\"; filming in the barren landscape of rural Jharkhand proved physically daunting for her. Anna M. M. Vetticad of \"Firstpost\" wrote that she \"issues one-liners in a monotone, but is unable to dig deep and summon up a relatable human being\". Vidya next played Sulu, a spirited housewife who moonlights as a relationship advice talk show host, in the comedy-drama \"Tumhari Sulu\". She identified with her character's enthusiastic personality and was pleased to play a rare comic part. She drew on her experience of playing a radio jockey in \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\" and listened to late-night talk shows. Writing for \"The Times of India\", Neil Soans commended Vidya for \"infusing Sulu with an abundance of infectious optimism without being aggravating\", and Shubhra Gupta took note of how well she channeled \"her distinctive voice and full-bellied laughter to invest Sulu with real warmth\". NDTV listed her performance as the best by a Hindi film actress that year, and she won her fifth Screen Award and fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actress. It also proved to be Vidya's first commercial success since 2012; she called the film's reception a \"major confidence booster\".\n\nVidya expanded into South Indian cinema in 2019, with roles in the two-part Telugu biopics, titled \"\" and \"\" (2019), and the Tamil drama \"Nerkonda Paarvai\". In the former two, a biopic of N. T. Rama Rao, she played the titular actor-politician's first wife. Both films failed to perform well commercially. In \"Nerkonda Paarvai\", a remake of the courtroom drama \"Pink\" (2016), she briefly played the wife of Ajith Kumar's character. Although not keen on remakes, she agreed to the project to bring attention to the film's theme of sexual consent. Srinivasa Ramanujam of \"The Hindu\" thought that the portions involving Vidya were inessential to the story. It emerged as one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of the year. \n\nIn the same year, Vidya teamed with Akshay Kumar for the third time in \"Mission Mangal\", about the Mars Orbiter Mission, which marked India's first interplanetary expedition. She liked the idea of playing Tara Shinde, a seemingly ordinary homemaker who balances her family life with her work as a scientist, and she was also pleased to work with four other leading ladies. Joe Leydon of \"Variety\" found Vidya to be \"drop-dead perfect from wire to wire\" and Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that she \"perfectly conveys Tara’s optimism and dedication, and hers is the only female character who has agency in this space agency saga\". She received another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. With global earnings of , \"Mission Mangal\" emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nVidya will next portray the mental calculator Shakuntala Devi in an eponymous biopic, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic will eschew a theatrical release and instead stream on Prime Video. She will next star in a short film about gender equality, entitled \"Natkhat\", which will also mark her first production venture, and in Amit V. Masurkar's \"Sherni\". Vidya has also committed to produce and star as Indira Gandhi in a yet-untitled web series based on Sagarika Ghose's biography \"Indira – India's Most Powerful Prime Minister\".\n\nThe mass media has often speculated about a romantic relationship between Vidya and her co-actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya was involved in a controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which \"caustic remarks\" were made at her due to her weight. She said, \"If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That someone whose approval mattered to me started to constantly find faults with me. At that point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship.\" Though she refused to name the person, tabloid reports suggested that she was referring to Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in \"Kismat Konnection\"). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai.\n\nVidya is trained in Carnatic music and briefly studied the dance forms of Bharatnatyam and Kathak. Regarding her religious affiliations, Vidya said, \"I am a person with a lot of faith and I have conversations [with God] all the time but I am not so religious in the conventional, organised sense\". She practices vegetarianism and was listed as \"India's hottest vegetarian\" in polls conducted by PETA in 2011 and 2012. Her weight fluctuations over the years have been the subject of substantial media coverage in India.\n\nIn March 2011, Vidya endorsed World Wildlife Fund's Earth Hour campaign in India. She campaigned for the cause of nutrition in India for Child In Need Institute (CINI), a non-profit organisation based in Kolkata. In September 2012, Vidya visited a village in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, where she participated in a campaign to promote children's education and the empowerment of women. In August 2013, she served as the grand marshal of the India Day parade held in New York City. In September that year, she launched a technology-based learning platform for underprivileged children in the Thanapur village of Uttar Pradesh. Also that year, Vidya featured as the host of \"No More Kamzor\", a television special on women empowerment. On the occasion of International Women's Day in 2015, Vidya wrote an opinion column in \"Hindustan Times\" on the issues faced by women in India. In August 2017, Vidya was made a member of the Indian Central Board of Film Certification, to certify films for theatrical exhibition. The following year, she became the goodwill ambassador of Arpan, an NGO that creates awareness on sexual abuse. In 2019, she collaborated with BIG FM 92.7 to host a radio show named \"Dhun Badal Ke Toh Dekho\".\n\nFollowing the success of \"Parineeta\" and \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\", Vidya's film roles were subject to wide critical analysis. Vir Sanghvi noted that the films \"Heyy Babyy\" and \"Kismat Konnection\" were \"strange films [...] in which she tried to pretend to be what she is not — a Bollywood bimbette.\" Vidya described that particular phase in her career as a \"struggle to be someone else\". Due to the criticism that her film choices evoked, Vidya decided to choose roles that she \"believed in\" rather than choose by convention. Members of the media have subsequently labelled her as \"bold\" and \"daring\" in her choices.\n\nHer starring roles in \"Heyy Babyy\" and \"Kismat Konnection\" also led to considerable attention in the media for her \"questionable wardrobe\". Several publications listed her as the \"worst dressed actress\" and her costume designers attributed her failure to carry off western clothes due to her weight and body structure. She was later praised in the media for wearing saris at public events; designer Niharika Khan explained, \"Vidya's beauty lies in her curves. She's comfortable in her voluptuousness, and therefore in a sari.\" Vidya has since been identified as defying \"an anglicised idea of sexuality\" and embody the idea of \"raw Indian sexuality\".\n\nAfter portraying strong protagonists in \"Paa\", \"Ishqiya\", \"No One Killed Jessica\", \"The Dirty Picture\" and \"Kahaani\", Vidya was credited in the media for pioneering a movement that breaks the stereotypical portrayal of heroines in Bollywood. The major commercial success of the latter two earned her the title of a \"female hero\" and Kalpana Nair of \"Firstpost\" noted that with these two films Vidya spearheaded a change in the roles that were offered to actresses over 30. Critic Mayank Shekhar predicted, \"Just a few smart male actors can completely change the face of a commercial, star-driven film industry. Looking at [...] Vidya Balan [...] it appears, that change could well originate from the leading lady instead.\"\n\n\"India Today\" featured Vidya in their 2012 listing of the nation's most powerful women and noted that \"she has toppled the all dominating hero, reducing him to a supporting role in a male dominated film industry\". Vidya was featured by \"Forbes India\" in their annual Celebrity 100 list in 2012 and 2013. She occupied the top slot in Rediff.com's annual listing of the year's best performances for two consecutive years (2010–11). She also featured in the list for the years 2005, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2016. In 2012, the magazine \"Verve\" featured her as one of India's \"Young Power Women\" and wrote, \"In a reel world peopled by size zero-toned bodies and pretty-as-a-picture heroines, Vidya comes across as completely real and natural – a woman who has followed her own instincts and dared to live her destiny by being her own person and not morphing herself to fit into any conventional slot.\" Two years later, the magazine listed her as a power icon. In 2018, \"The Economic Times\" considered Vidya to be one of the most prominent celebrity brand ambassadors in India.\n\nIn 2014, Vidya was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India, for her contributions to the entertainment industry.
